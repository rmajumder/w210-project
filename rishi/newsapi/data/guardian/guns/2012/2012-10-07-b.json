  "<p>George Osborne has opened the way for a fresh round of \u00a310bn welfare cuts by securing agreement from the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, and promising the Liberal Democrats that the cuts will be balanced by a bigger contribution from the rich.</p> <p>Duncan Smith had been the main Conservative obstacle to more welfare cuts but on Sunday he wrote a joint article with the chancellor saying he was \"satisfied\" such savings were possible.</p> <p>In return, the Treasury has given him the final political go-ahead for universal credit, his cherished but risky master plan to merge benefits and tax credits from next year.</p> <p>Senior Tory sources also suggested that senior Lib Dems had also accepted the fresh cuts as long as Osborne and Cameron stuck to their promises made that the rich would have to make the largest contribution to the next attack on the deficit.</p> <p>Osborne and the Lib Dems have been scouring Whitehall for \u00a316bn of further cuts to be implemented in 2015-16 ever since Osborne was forced in last year's autumn statement to concede that he could not eradicate the structural deficit in this parliament.</p> <p>Although Osborne does not need to spell out the precise details of the 2015-16 deficit reduction programme until next year's autumn statement, the welfare reforms will require legislation to be in place within two years at the most. The first targets are likely to be housing benefit for the under 25s and restraint on the uprating of benefits.</p> <p>Osborne's two deals \u2013 with Duncan Smith and senior Lib Dems \u2013 free the chancellor to put political pressure on Labour to explain its plans to cut the deficit.</p> <p>In a joint article in the Daily Mail, Duncan Smith and Osborne state: \"We are united in our determination to deliver universal credit, the most fundamental reform of our benefits system for a generation, on time and on budget.\"</p> <p>They say that further savings are needed in most government departments and most areas of spending at the next spending review.</p> <p>They also point out that the Treasury illustrated at the time of the last budget that if the rate of reductions in departmental budgets in the next spending review period is to be kept at the current rate, the welfare budget will have to be reduced by more than \u00a310bn by 2016-17.</p> <p>They write: \"We are both satisfied that this is possible and we will work together to find savings of this scale.\"</p> <p>Duncan Smith has also given ground by accepting David Cameron's commitment not to withdraw rich pensioners' access to TV licence, travel passes or winter fuel payments.</p> <p>The agreement between the two cabinet members has been struck as the paper serialises a biography of Osborne that lays out some of the past heated disputes over welfare cuts between the two men.Setting out his plans for further cuts, Cameron told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \"We are going to take further action to make sure that the richest people in our country pay a fair share towards deficit reduction. The richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax. They are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under Labour.\"</p> <p>Cameron also ruled out a mansion tax, the Liberal Democrats favoured means of squeezing the rich.</p> <p>In his speech on Monday, Osborne will say anyone remotely serious about tackling UK's problems needs to start by setting out how savings, including in welfare, will be achieved, something Labour is intent on avoiding until next year at the earliest.</p> <p>Tory strategists believe the public are in the mood to hear an honest assessment of how global forces are challenging the UK economy to be more competitive.</p> <p>He will explain how in every single year of this parliament the rich will pay a greater share of our nation's tax revenues than in any one of the 13 years that Labour were in office.</p> <p>The chancellor will also use his speech to announce a \u00a31bn of joint industry, university and government funding for world-leading science projects in the UK.</p> <p>The government will add \u00a3200m of new money to the Research Partnership Investment Fund, which supports university capital projects. The Fund was launched at the 2012 budget, with \u00a3100m of funding but has been heavily oversubscribed with a large number of high-calibre bids.</p> <p>To access the money, universities must at least double the public funding through contributions from private companies or charities. So, by tripling the government support to \u00a3300m, the total investment, including the universities own contributions, is expected to be at least \u00a31bn.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's largest business lobby group has urged the government to privatise motorways and introduce more toll roads in the latest plea from the private sector for radical action on infrastructure.</p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry wants ministers to privatise the repair and maintenance of more than 1,000 miles of motorway in England, amid estimates of a \u00a310bn funding shortfall at the Highways Agency.</p> <p>Jonathan Cridland, the director general of the CBI, said the nation's roads are so drastically underfunded that \"levering private sector investment is the only way [to fund] a long-term future for roads\".</p> <p>\"The UK road network is the last piece of infrastructure fully funded by the government,\" he said. The CBI's intervention echoes calls from the RAC Foundation thinktank, which argues that a sell-off could pave the way for charging.</p> <p>Under Cridland's plan the Highways Agency will be disbanded and control of England's motorways will be passed to a new regulator, which would \"offer franchises to private providers to run parts of the road network\".</p> <p>\"[The plan envisages] taking the whole of the strategic road network and allocating it on a strategic basis,\" he said. \"Over time private operators would be able to finance essential upgrades [as well as repairs and maintenance,\"</p> <p>Cridland said the Highways Agency, which manages England's motorways for the Department for Transport, is \"starved\" of cash, and it was a \"question of when [privatisation of the network] will happen, rather than if\".</p> <p>As well as privatising the maintenance of the motorways, Cridland advocated an increase in road tolling in order to pay for upgrades. \"We need better roads,\" he said. \"[And] we [the country] no longer have enough money to pay for them.\"</p>",
  "<p>The race to become next governor of the Bank of England will enter the final straight on Monday morning as applications close in the search for a successor to Mervyn King. The inside candidate, Paul Tucker, is viewed as the favourite despite his stumble during investigations into the Libor scandal.</p> <p>Lord O'Donnell, former head of the civil service, who was also one of the frontrunners for the post, has decided not to apply, leaving Lord Turner, head of the Financial Services Authority, as the other serious contender for a post that has been described as the most powerful in the civil service because of its beefed-up responsibilities under a new regulatory regime.</p> <p>O'Donnell said that after 33 years in the public sector he was looking at other priorities. \"You need a governor who desperately wants the job and is willing to serve eight years,\" he told the Financial Times.</p> <p>He denied he had been campaigning for the job and said he was taking up a position with Frontier Economics as an adviser, but would not be drawn on his favoured candidate. \"I hope whoever is governor is supportive of monetary and fiscal co-ordination,\" O'Donnell told the FT. \"Yes, you need an independent governor, but some things need the [Bank and Treasury] working together. Quantitative easing is a classic example where governor and chancellor need to work together.\"</p> <p>The full list of applicants will be given to George Osborne after the 8.30am deadline on Monday, and a decision is expected by the end of the year. The new governor will take over in June 2013.</p> <p>Whoever gets the \u00a3302,000 job will be given greater powers than King has had during his 10 years running the Bank. As part of a complete overhaul of financial regulation, the Bank of England will next year take on responsibility for monitoring the wider banking system and preventing financial or economic crises, as well as looking after monetary policy.</p> <p>Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said: \"The single biggest issue is that the job has just got so huge and that, in effect, has narrowed the field of suitable candidates. Paul Tucker, having served as deputy governor, is clearly one of the stand-out candidates.\"</p> <p>Tucker has spent almost his entire career at the Bank of England. He has been deputy governor in charge of financial stability for more than three years. However, his long tenure could count against him. As executive director for markets in 2002-09, he was a key policymaker during the period that markets spun out of control.</p> <p>He has also been tainted by the Libor scandal. Emails released during the investigation into rate-rigging suggested Tucker was far too close to the now disgraced former Barclays boss Bob Diamond. Although cleared of deliberate wrongdoing, Tucker was accused of naivety for failing to spot the market abuse.</p> <p>Turner, who steps down as Financial Services Authority chairman next year when the regulator is split into two, has been the banks' most outspoken critic but some say he has too many enemies in the City to be a successful governor.</p> <p>It is thought the Treasury could look abroad to fill the role, although it has been quick to deny reports that Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of Canada, has been sounded out. Claims this weekend that Glenn Stevens, governor of the Australian central bank, was asked to apply have been quashed in the Australian press.</p> <p>Other outside contenders include Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the bank, although most people believe that at 45 he is too young.</p> <p>Kate Barker is one of the few women to be mentioned. As a member of the monetary policy committee over nine years, she helped set interest rates, but has criticised plans to hand the Bank extra powers to oversee the wider banking system.</p> <p>For the first time, the Treasury advertised the job in the Economist. The advertisement called for a \"strong communicator\", with \"good interpersonal skills\" and \"a person of undisputed integrity and standing\".</p> <p>Candidates were asked to send a resume, cover letter and a questionnaire disclosing prior political activity and potential conflicts of interest.</p> <p>A panel of senior civil servants will consider applicants and make recommendations to the chancellor and prime minister.</p> <h2><strong>In the frame</strong></h2> <p><strong>Paul Tucker</strong></p> <p>The deputy governor of the Bank of England has intimate knowledge of the central bank after more than two decades there, but could be tainted by the Libor rate-rigging scandal. Despite that, he remains the leading contender.</p> <p><strong>Adair Turner</strong></p> <p>In 2009, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority described much of the City's activities as socially useless, which may have won him too many enemies to take on the role of governor.</p> <p><strong>John Vickers</strong></p> <p>A former Bank of England chief economist, Vickers was appointed by the government to lead the Independent Commission on Banking to promote stability in the banking industry. His appointment would suggest the government is committed to banking reform.</p> <p><strong>Kate Barker </strong></p> <p>As a former member of the Bank's monetary policy committee, Barker has extensive experience of the central bank, but she has been outspoken about the new powers to be handed to the next governor.</p>",
  "<p>Ashley Cole, Man of the People. Overstatement maybe, but his muscular response to the FA's comments about him undoubtedly chimed with the mood of the nation like nothing he has said or done before. I feel sure my reaction to the full-back's <em>cri de coeur </em>was not untypical: \"Ah, the old bunch-of-twats argument, I've used it myself.\"</p> <p>Who among us has not used similar terms to describe those in authority; employers, law enforcers, the government, in-laws? Sure, as a rallying cry, \"bunch of twats\" might not quite be up there with \"Power to the people\" or \"Give me liberty or give me death,\" but in the current economic climate particularly, Cole's notorious hashtag spoke eloquently for the common man struggling under the yoke.</p> <p>And the FA seems an entirely suitable target for Cole's broadside. Its convolutions over the John Terry case&#xa0;\u2013&#xa0;<em>L'affaire </em>John Terry, as we're calling it on the streets \u2013 mishandling of various England managerial appointments, and even its role in the Hillsborough tragedy, leads one to the view that Cole's hashtag should maybe be incorporated into its coat of arms.</p> <p>So impressed was I by Cole's pithy assessment of his England masters, I felt compelled to hashtag back, #faircomment-onamatterofpublicinterest, and I am prepared to give evidence in the inevitable 14-month, meticulous, expensively lawyered investigation into whether the FA is a bunch of what Cole says they are.</p> <p>I love Twitter incidentally, unlike Alan Shearer, who said on the BBC's Football Focus: \"I don't get this Twitter lark, I have to tell you,\" and recommended footballers be banned from using it, adding somewhat tangentially: \"They do it with motor bikes.\"</p> <p>On the contrary, I think footballers should be encouraged to use Twitter and fined if their comments are bland and predictable. Twitter is one of the few chances we, the people, have of hearing directly from footballers, unless you count the PR mush masquerading as interview that Football Focus served us on Saturday; Steven Gerrard plugging his autobiography and Victor Moses hawking a new computer game, for goodness' sake.</p> <p>The Gerrard piece was forgivable given the player's profile but if you are obliged to screen a shot of some glorified pinball game in order to get access to a Chelsea reserve, is it not time for a public service broadcaster to respond in the style of Cole, and show some old goals or archive of John Motson in his sheepskin coat instead?</p> <p>The row over Cole's tweet \u2013 twatgate, as I like to think it will soon be called \u2013 rumbled on all weekend. Garth Crooks suggested on the BBC's Final Score that suitable punishment would be to ban Cole from playing in England's World Cup qualifier on Friday, which seems eminently sensible given that we could probably play Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall at left-back against San Marino and get a result.</p> <p>Roberto Di Matteo's announcement that Cole was to be disciplined by Chelsea was felt important enough to be breaking news during ESPN's coverage of West Ham\u2013Arsenal, thankfully not interrupting Sam Allardyce's interview where he was asked if Andy Carroll was ready to return and said: \"He's biting at the bit, as the old cliche goes,\" one I'm sure that's rarely far from any of our lips.</p> <p>I happened to catch the match after watching an episode of the excellent documentary series Sporting Greats, featuring the baseball legend Babe Ruth, and that was when the parallels between the American folk hero and our own pantomime villain struck.</p> <p>When Babe played for the Boston Red Sox, he was \"a kinda pain in the neck,\" the writer Peter Golenbock told the show (see why Cole came to mind?). \"There was always some trouble, he was always hitting Harry Frazee [Red Sox owner] for a bit more money.\" Frazee sold Babe to New York Yankees, said Golenbock, \"to get him out of his hair\".</p> <p>Ruth was described as an everyman figure who \"ate large, drank large, and womanised large,\" which is where Cole departs from his baseball counterpart, most of his floozies having been built on more trim lines. Ruth was also described as having \"a face that people could relate to,\" so there is some work for Ashley to do there as well.</p> <p>Maybe for true folk heroism, we should look to the performance of the Leeds Rhinos captain, Kevin Sinfield, in the Super League Grand Final. After being laid out in a clash of heads that would have had a small army of medics invading the pitch in other sports, Sinfield shook his head, swallowed and spat, and moments later stepped up to faultlessly convert a penalty.</p> <p>And after 80 minutes of that kind of stuff, he took the mike and delivered to the crowd an articulate, modest and gracious speech, remembering to thank everyone who needed to be thanked. His captaincy and all-round performance were exceptional, and the match was about half as good as Sky's commentators kept telling us it was, which meant it was very good indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Japan has proved a happy hunting ground again for Sebastian Vettel, having won at Suzuka in 2009 and 2010 and claimed the world championship here last year, he has now ensured this year's title race almost begins again from scratch after a flag-to-pole win that puts him four points behind the championship leader Fernando Alonso, who was knocked off at the first corner.</p> <p>Vettel's drive was untroubled but while he takes the season's first back-to-back wins and momentum into the final five races, it was the other crash, immediately after Alonso's, yet again involving Romain Grosjean, and Lewis Hamilton's tussle with his McLaren replacement, Sergio P\u00e9rez that attracted most comment.</p> <p>Already under fire for his driving, Grosjean did himself no further favours in the race, having only made it to Turn Two before shunting into Mark Webber's Red Bull, guilty of watching Perez who was alongside him, rather than the Australian who was in front.</p> <p>He has already been punished with a one-race ban after causing the crash that knocked out Alonso and Lewis Hamilton at the first corner at Spa. But that was just the most spectacular (and potentially dangerous) of a season littered with errors. This marks the eighth time the Frenchman has been involved in an incident in 15 races and, more worryingly for the other drivers waiting for the lights to go out, it is the fifth time it has happened on the first lap.</p> <p>Webber had no joy when he went knocking on the driver's motorhome door but he and others were quick to speak out on the incident. \"The guys confirmed that it was the first-lap nutcase again \u2013 Grosjean. The rest of us are trying to fight for some decent results each weekend but he is trying to get to the third corner as fast as he can at every race,\" Webber said.</p> <p>The FIA issued no further sanction to either the driver or his team but Webber had several suggestions of his own. \"It makes it frustrating because a few big guys probably suffered from that and maybe he needs another holiday,\" he said, referring to the post-Spa ban. \"Maybe we have two separate starts, one for him and one for us.\"</p> <p>Interviewed after the race Grosjean, however, dismissed the clash as a racing incident. \"Nothing special. Trying to avoid any contact was my main objective and [it] didn't work. It was a stupid clash,\" he said.</p> <p>But Webber, who finished ninth, was not alone. Jenson Button, finishing the race in fourth after chasing down Sauber's&#xa0;Kamui Kobayashi who held on to take third behind Ferrari's Felipe Massa to&#xa0;the elation of the local fans, was also critical of Grosjean. Informed of the number of incidents he has had this year, the British driver responded bluntly. \"Unbelievable isn't it? Is it for Formula One to do something about it? Or should he just take a good look at himself and sort his shit out, because that what he needs to do,\" he said.</p> <p>\"He's quick, he's very talented in terms of speed and results. But you can't do that,\" Button added. \"We saw it a lot in GP2 with him. He'd either win or crash and it seems he has the same philosophy and he needs to change his views.\"</p> <p>Button's team-mate Hamilton, who started from ninth and finished fifth, was not involved in the Grosjean incident but was, in turn, less than complimentary about P\u00e9rez, the driver who takes his seat at McLaren next year. P\u00e9rez passed him on the inside at the hairpin once and went wide a second time at the same corner that ended the Mexican's race.</p> <p>\"He didn't catch me napping. I am racing for the championship and I have no time to be messing around with people that are taking silly risks, I saw him coming from a long way away,\" Hamilton said. \"I thought that he was going to do a crazy manoeuvre, which he did.</p> <p>\"Then [later] when he was behind me, I saw it coming again so I moved a little to the inside, thinking that he was going to go up the inside so he couldn't get by, and he just flew down the outside of me.\"</p> <p>Red Bull still lead the constructors' championship from McLaren but by only 41 points and the team were clearly annoyed that Webber, who had started on the front row alongside Vettel, had not been able to claim more points for the team.</p> <p>Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, said of Grosjean: \"I think he needs to have a talk with himself. At this level I think it's completely unacceptable. Hopefully he'll have a good look in the mirror or his team need to get him under a bit more control.\"</p> <p>Red Bull, however, with Vettel's victory here, combined with Alonso's failure to score, have made a huge move forward.</p> <p>Ferrari can no longer expect that decent points finishes and reliability are enough to win them the title and are in what Alonso described as \"a mini championship\". They have to try and match Red Bull on the track, which is a big ask, as the latter are peaking in development terms at just the right time. If they take the same speed to Korea next weekend, Vettel has a strong chance of finally being ahead of the Spaniard by Sunday night.</p>",
  "<p>Audacity has become one of Alan Pardew's favourite words. It is a trait he actively encourages in his players but not even Hatem Ben Arfa can match the chutzpah of Newcastle United's board.</p> <p>Whereas Pardew wants his team to pass and move with dash and daring, Mike Ashley, Newcastle's owner, possesses a rare capacity to court unpopularity in pursuit of financial benefit. Accordingly Tyneside woke to reports that Wonga, the payday loans company often criticised for its interest rates, was in advanced negotiations with Newcastle over a shirt and, possibly, stadium sponsorship deal.</p> <p>To say the prospect did not go down well with fans would be an understatement. Indeed, judging from the initial reaction, the debate about the club's wider social responsibilities versus a potential \u00a38m a year for player investment seemed as one-sided as the opening stages of Manchester United's visit.</p> <p>As good as the movement of Jonny Evans and Patrice Evra proved at the two corners from which they headed their side into a two-goal lead, such swift set-piece concession were galling for Pardew.</p> <p>In mitigation, Newcastle's manager was without his first-choice goalkeeper, Tim Krul, and his preferred central defensive pairing of Fabricio Coloccini and Steven Taylor.</p> <p>Even so all Pardew's talk of his team breaking into the top four rang a little hollow. Or at least it did until he ordered Ben Arfa \u2013 by some distance Newcastle's best and most audacious individual \u2013 to switch from the right of a 4-4-2 starting formation to the left of a 4-3-3 configuration.</p> <p>Suddenly, Newcastle finished the first half strongly, Sir Alex Ferguson was out of his dugout and arguing with the fourth official, Kevin Friend, (whose proffered hand Manchester United's manager, incidentally, neglected to shake) and St James' Park reflected on what might have been.</p> <p>As Newcastle recaptured some of the \"rhythmic control\" \u2013 another favourite Pardew term \u2013 that characterised much of their rise to a fifth-placed finish last season, a big \"if only\" moment arrived early in the second half. Demba Ba hit the bar and Papiss Ciss\u00e9 believed he had squeezed the rebound over the line only for Howard Webb to give David de Gea the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>Home supporters were already upset with Webb following the first-half incident in which the referee booked Cheik Tiot\u00e9 for bundling over Wayne Rooney. The England forward may have made the most of that challenge but Tiot\u00e9's penchant for attracting yellow cards represents a problem. The Ivorian's enforcement skills are essential to establishing Newcastle's passing style \u2013 not to mention permitting Yohan Cabaye to strut his midfield stuff \u2013 but, all too often, Tiot\u00e9 is left needing to watch his step after attracting a booking.</p> <p>They say that 2-0 is a dangerous lead and Newcastle might just have hauled themselves back into things had his second-half labours not been cramped by a second booking in four days.</p> <p>Instead, Tom Cleverley's wonder goal \u2013 or mishit cross \u2013 ensured that the best efforts of Ben Arfa and friends would count for nothing. It also offered confirmation that Pardew's bold \u2013 some would say audacious - pre-match talk about his side's ability to reprise January's Premier League home victory against Manchester United had turned to dust.</p> <p>That said, it would be wrong to say that Newcastle have regressed since that stirring 3-0 triumph. Ben Arfa has since blossomed into one of the Premier League's brightest talent, Papiss Ciss\u00e9's goal threat has arrived, Davide Santon is looking the full-back that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho once dubbed \"a phenomenon\" at Internazionale and young talents such as Shane Ferguson and Sammy Ameobi are emerging fast.</p> <p>The only trouble is that key personnel including Tiot\u00e9, Cabaye and Ciss\u00e9 have taken time to get going this autumn, Europa League commitments inevitably stretching sometimes fairly slender squad resources and there are now real expectations to live up to.</p> <p>No matter. Pardew's recently signed eight-year contract is studded with exclusion clauses catering for assorted contingencies yet it affords him the time required to weather episodes of minor turbulence. Nonetheless the manager remains anxious to avoid another defeat on Sunday week when his players travel to Sunderland for a north-east derby featuring two teams struggling to hit peak form.</p> <p>Wearsiders will mock the apparently impending Wonga connection but at least, in Ben Arfa, Pardew possesses a player whose interpretation of audacity comes laden with class and verve.</p>",
  "<p>To the callers it's obvious: if you've dropped your new glasses in the street, are being irritated by your neighbour playing his radio too loudly, or your pigeon is wheezing \u2013 just phone 999.</p> <p>A surge in the number of ludicrous or hoax 999 calls \u2013 Cleveland police alone report a 35% increase in the year to July 2012, and Devon and Cornwall reports that peak-time calls were up by 40% last month \u2013 is causing a genuine emergency, putting tremendous pressure on overstretched staff at a time of swingeing budget cuts.</p> <p>Some forces are determined to tackle the malicious callers and time wasters. One caller who rang police 23 times asking for a lift from Hartlepool to Stockton was prosecuted, as was a 17-year-old girl whose hoax call about a bomb in Middlesbrough town centre caused chaos as the whole area was evacuated.</p> <p>The ambulance service in Leeds, West Yorkshire, received a 33-minute 999 call in July, apparently from a terrified three-year-old girl. After an extensive and costly search by police, the hoaxers turned out to be two 10-year-old girls in Bridlington. Although they are at the age of criminal responsibility, police have said they will not be prosecuted.</p> <p>In Hampshire Jason Garrad, who called police up to seven times a day, at one point about his pet hamster, was sentenced to 80 hours' unpaid work. He was already in breach of an antisocial behaviour order, and agreed he had \"too much time on his hands\".</p> <p>In north Staffordshire 100 calls threatening to smash up police cars, made over six days, were traced to the home in Fenton of unemployed Yasmin Adams, 21, who said she did it because she was bored. She was given a 24-month community order.</p> <p>In the east Midlands a man rang to ask for help with a pigeon suffering from breathing difficulties; another said he'd been bitten by a snake but turned out to be high on drugs. Other cases among the 1,800 hoax or inappropriate calls last year include the caller who said he hadn't slept for two days, the man bleeding because he had squeezed a spot, and the incompetent person wanting help to change a battery in a remote control.</p> <p>Michael Jones, ambulance service delivery manager, said the calls weren't limited to one specific age group, they came from adults, children and teenagers. What they had in common, he said, was a complete lack of understanding that the calls left others who couldn't get through at risk.</p> <p>David Mackie, associate medical director at Yorkshire Ambulance Service, said the 2,000 hoax calls were a tiny proportion of the 750,000 calls received each year, but warned: \"It's a great additional burden on ambulance services, which are incredibly busy anyway.\"</p> <p>Some callers have mental health issues, some are from children and teenagers, and others are from attention-seeking adults who in his words \"like to see ambulances, police cars and fire engines\".</p> <p>On Merseyside, where the fire service received 1,122 hoax calls in 2011, an investigation identified 18 adults who were responsible for a total of 1,000 calls over 24 months. In south Wales a man called an ambulance complaining of stomach pains, but recovered promptly on arrival at University Hospital Cardiff, and ran off shouting \"thanks for the lift, mate\". The service also reports people dialling 999 the afternoon after the night before, when the hangover wears off and they discover injuries.</p> <p>The Bridlington MP Greg Knight said that although it was a serious issue, it was a historic problem. In 1937, in the first week of the 999 service, there were 91 hoax calls.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The British, French and German governments will hold further talks on Monday in an attempt to break the impasse over the planned \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) merger between BAE Systems and EADS before Wednesday's deadline to agree a deal.</p> <p>Sources close to the proposed combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the owner of Airbus admitted that both companies are likely to seek an extension from the UK Takeover Panel. One source said it was \"less likely than more likely\" that a deal will be reached by the deadline, although the granting of more time by the panel is considered a formality given the complexities of the merger. \"The betting is on an extension being applied for,\" said the source.</p> <p>EADS's and BAE's advisers have made preparations for an extension, while playing down reports from Germany last week that intergovernmental talks over the deal are on the verge of collapse. The French and German governments each control 22.35% of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings, while the British government can block the transaction through a golden share in BAE that allows it to prevent foreign ownership of the business.</p> <p>Talks to protect those national interests have hit difficulties after a conference call between government representatives on Friday saw Germany stun France and the UK with a request that the headquarters of the combined business be based in Munich. Germany is also seeking a guarantee from the Elyse\u00e9 that its stake in the new company will not be larger than 9%, the same size as Berlin's proposed stakeholding.</p> <p>The three governments will make a further attempt to settle their differences in a conference call on Monday. The British representatives on the call will include Bernard Gray, the Ministry of Defence's head of procurement, with France represented by Emmanuel Macron, an adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Germany's case argued by Lars Hendrik-R\u00f6ller, chief economic adviser to the chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p> <p>The UK defence secretary, Philip Hammond, warned on Sunday that the government will block the deal if there is excessive French and German control of the business. Such a scenario is also expected to trigger a US veto of the deal, with the Pentagon's approval still needed because it is BAE's biggest single customer. \"We want to see this company \u2026 prospering as a commercial business, focused on doing things that are right for the business, not beholden to or controlled by any one government,\" Hammond told BBC Radio 4. Indicating that the government would allow some French and German ownership, he added: \"It is not necessary to have no French or German government interest in the company. It is necessary to reduce that stake below the level at which it can control or direct the way the company acts.\"</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, told Sky News that the deal must protect UK jobs, with EADS and BAE employing more than 50,000 staff in Britain and representing the country's biggest manufacturing employer. \"Our priorities are of course the national security of the United Kingdom. Second: jobs and investment in the UK.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Downton Abbey series three.

Cousin Isobel said the word \"prostitute\" 73 times. There were some good points: the new footman, the reappearance of the Molesley-deprived Mrs Bird, the new footman. But mostly this was a rehash of things we've seen before. Once again Downton is in ill-defined monetary peril: \"Downton is being mismanaged!\" But how? I blame the overspend on bouillon spoons.</p> <p>This is what happens when you set up a massively high-stakes entail-dependent narrative which relies on one of the sisters marrying her cousin, the only heir, and then she does just that. There's nowhere to go when that marriage has taken place. We can only hope that our focus is now supposed to fall on Anna and Bates as our source of suspense and emotional investment. Because now that Downton is in theory \"saved\", we're all in danger of losing the plot.</p> <p>Other elements felt repetitive. We've seen \"Tom\" Branson (I still can't get used to them calling him Tom either) blow his top and be all revolutionary before. We know he's a crazy firebrand. There was more mileage in the idea that even Sybil is starting to doubt him now. Because he's such a crazy firebrand. But the whole \"you set fire to our aristocratic blood brothers in their beds, you crazy firebrand\" thing never quite took off.</p> <p>More deja vu elsewhere. We've had Sybil the suffragette; now Edith is casting off her feminine mystique. But where are her pantaloons? The Earl of Grantham is once more becoming all stressy and paternalistic. His attentions usually start to stray when he gets like this. I predict the entrance of another attractive maid with a son at Ripon Grammar. And Daisy's love interest was thwarted once again. (Remember how she once had a soft spot for Thomas?)</p> <p>Overall: too expositional, too setting-things-up-for-next-week, too dull. And, except for the electric toaster and the eye-candy footman and a few great facial expressions from Thomas and O'Brien, very little humour. And where oh where is Shirley MacLaine? Is she trapped in the cold meat cupboard? She has been there a few weeks now, she'll start to smell.</p> <h2>Random Subplot Alert</h2> <p>Ethel's moral dilemma is whether Charlie should be brought up as the son of a nice person who happens to be a prostitute, or as the son of nasty people who are not prostitutes. We have been here before, although Ethel wasn't quite a prostitute then \u2013 just a hussy. A bit too much detail with Evil Moustache Man Father-in-Law Type virtually salivating at the thought of the \"client list\".</p> <p>It was beautifully acted, and it was also somehow refreshing to see a child \u2013 get that baby out, Sybil! You've been pregnant for three years now! \u2013 but, really, this was just an excuse to get Ethel (Amy Nuttall) back into the cast, unencumbered by a squealing toddler. I look forward to seeing how she gets on in Cousin Isobel's house working alongside Mrs \"Outraged and Molesley-Mourning\" Bird.</p> <h2>Golden Eyebrow award of the Week</h2> <p>No contest. Mrs Hughes wins hands down. How many hours were spent perfecting the look upon her face when Cousin Isobel enunciated the word \"prostitute\"? \"My, my. That's not a word you hear in this house every day.\" It is now, if Cousin Isobel has anything to do with it!</p> <p>Indeed special mention must be given here to Cousin Isobel for the relish she takes in brazenly uttering the word \"prostitute\". It's almost as if she's taken on this charitable life-rebuilding work in order to be able to say this word as often as possible. \"Prostitute. Did you hear what I said? I'm going to say it again. Yes, I said 'prostitute'. I will not be silenced. Prostitute!\" The frequency of this word in her vocabulary is rivalled only by the expression \"rebuilding their lives\". Bit Oprah for the 1920s, no?</p> <h2>Surprise Character Development</h2> <p>The biggest shock of the past few weeks, electric toasters aside, has been how boring Lady Mary and Matthew have become since they got lobotomised, I mean, married. Lady Mary is like a different woman and one that's not as fun. Signs of revival emerged tonight with the cryptic nursery scene. \"So \u2026 the doctor \u2026?\" \"Mmm \u2026 Just my hay fever.\" It wasn't clear what we were supposed to read into this. He wants her to get pregnant but she doesn't want to? She is taking secret measures to prevent pregnancy? Or maybe she is just missing Mr Pamuk. Aren't we all.</p> <h2>Sorry, could you just repeat that awkward line of dialogue?</h2> <p>There were some corkers this week.</p> <p><strong>Carson</strong>: \"Can we bring the staff back up to snuff?\" Is this an expression? Was it ever an expression? Once again our hearts go out to the actors who must make these lines work.</p> <p><strong>Cousin Violet</strong>: \"That sort of thing is so horrid ...\"<br><strong>Edith</strong>: \"Being jilted at the altar?\"<br>A lovely piqued interchange. After all, Cousin Violet was first up the aisle to usher Lord Sir Anthony Strallen-Gormless out.</p> <p><strong>Lord Grantham</strong>: \"There seems to be something of the Johnny Foreigner about Catholics.\" Pardon? I know this is 1920-something and he is an aristocrat and everything and not very politically correct but where, exactly, are we going with this?</p> <h2>Next week</h2> <p>Poor Jimmy feels the weight of Thomas's amorous attentions. \"Mr Barrow is getting, er familiar.\" Cousin Isobel, surprise, surprise, hires Ethel the Prostitute to help her Rebuild her Life. And, on the strength of one letter to the editor, Edith becomes a lady newspaper columnist. Whatever next?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Derby della Madonnina.</strong> <em>Derby della Madonnina.</em> Derby della Madonnina. The words alone get the juices flowing. Any match with its own name gets automatically lifted to a new status in the football calendar - El Clasico, the Old Firm derby, the Derby della Madonnina, the Derby d'Italia \u2026 (can anyone out there name any more? Not just the North London derby or whatever, but matches with more evocative titles if possible \u2026)</p> <p>Both Inter and Meeelan come at this fixture after difficult starts to the season. The Rossoneri had their worst start to a campaign since 1940; the Nerazzurri begun their season at the San Siro with back-to-back home defeats for the first time in 75 years. Both, though, seem to have turned the corner. Inter have now won three on the bounce, Milan have broken their San Siro duck and had a fine win at Zenit St Petersberg in midweek. </p> <p>Though it seems a fascinating fixture from the outside, it doesn't seem to have captured the imagination of those in the city. Around 2,000 tickets remain unsold at San Siro.</p> <p><strong>Team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Milan (4-2-3-1):</strong> Abbiati; Bonera, Yepes, Mexes, De Sciglio; De Jong, Montolivo; Emanuelson, Boateng, El Sharaawy; Bojan. Subs: Amelia, Gabriel, Robinho, Nocerino, Pazzini, Acerbi, Flamini, Zapata, Abate, Costant, Ambrosini, Antonini<br><strong>Inter (3-4-1-2):</strong> Handanovic; Ranocchia, Samuel, Juan Jesus; Zanetti, Gargano, Cambiasso, Nagatomo; Coutinho; Milito, Cassano. Subs: Castellazzi, Belec, Silvestre, Palacio, Guarin, Mudingayi, Obi, Pereira, Duncan, Jonathan, Bianchetti, Livaja<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Paolo Valeri (Rome).</p> <p>Inter look like they've stuck to three at the back. Milan give Bojan a lone furrow to plough up front.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Another match-with-a-name</strong></p> <p>\"There's another heated, named derby kicking off fifteen minutes after the Derby della Madonnina, it's <strong>Le Classique</strong> between Olympique de Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain at OM's home, the Stade V\u00e9lodrome,\" writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \"Yes, it's modeled after, and takes its name from, El Cl\u00e1sico, but by now it's its own thing. A fierce rivalry between the most successful French team and the team from the capital. Now it's given added spice by the fact that Paris Saint-Germain are rolling in Qatari money, while Marseille are having to do more with less. And tonight, if PSG win, they go top of Ligue 1. However, Marseille have won 22 out of 33 Classiques at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome. It could be a great game.\"</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Click-clack, click-clack \u2026</strong> Out come the teams into the Milan night. Inter players holding the hands of Milan-shirted mascots, and Milan likewise with Inter-shirted youngsters.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Peep!</strong> Paolo Valeri blows his whistle and Inter get us underway.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Samuel dumps Boateng to the turf in the centre-circle with a just-to-let-you-know-I'm-here challenge.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Cassano is bundled over on the left touchline. Massimo Allegri gets up in the referee's grill as a result. \"I'm not sure that was a free-kick, you know,\" he screams. I may be paraphrasing.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Milan 0-1 Internazionale (Samuel 3)</strong> And from the resultant free-kick Inter take the lead. That won't do much for Allegri's mood. Cambiasso swung the thing in deep to the far post where Samuel is sliding in, almost on his knees, and bullets the ball in to the roof of the net.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> What a start for Inter! And now Cassano's won a corner. He responds by urging the Inter fans behind the goal to get behind the team.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> \u2026 again Milan struggle to clear. Eventually the shot goes wide.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> <strong>HOW ON EARTH IS THAT NOT 2-0?</strong> Diego Milito misses not one but two sitters in the space of five seconds. He's handed the ball by Abbiati inside the area, but Mexes does superbly to get back and block the shot from eight yards out. The ball loops up and the unchallenged Milito nods a header as soft as a baby kitten's belly straight at the keeper. He took too long with the first chance, then rushed the second. A huge let-off for the home side.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Cassano skips down the right. The home fans whistle with as much gusto as they can manage. It's quite hard to whistle furiously but they're giving it a good go.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Boateng goes into Valeri's Big Book Of Terribly Rum Fellows after bringing down (I think) Gargano.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Emanuelson gets a little lucky as Juan trips him needlessly 40 yards from goal. Potentially dangerous free-kick this for Milan \u2026</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> \u2026 rolled to Montolivo who sends a glorious effort that swerves and dips like a badly-flung frisbee just wide of Handanovic's goal.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> El Shaarawy, Milan's in-form man, hasn't been involved at all as yet. But, as I type that, he wins a corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> \u2026 nodded away, then smashed over on the volley by Bonera from around 3,724 yards.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Emanuelson wangs a cross pointlessly, hopelessly and uselessly over the heads of a couple of his team-mates.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Nagatomo does well to tuck in from wing-back and deny El Shaarawy space in the area. The home side are gradually getting on top here.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Coutinho finds Milito, but the Argentinian struggles to make the most of what appeared a promising situation.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> El Shaarawy, who seems to have been constantly on the ball since I mentioned that he wasn't getting involved, fires a decent effort into the breadbasket of Handanovic.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Nagatomo goes into the book for a challenge on Yepes that could've seen either one of them penalised.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Cambiasso catches Montolivo with a slightly wild challenge. Free-kick to Milan \u2026</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> \u2026 headed away by Juan for a corner, which is whipped in far too deep by the wasteful Emanuelson.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Milan may have clawed their way back into it, but they don't look to have much idea about how to break down this Inter defence, other than with (so far poorly taken) set-pieces. That said, Inter haven't had a sniff since Milito botched that double-chance.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Countinho scoots forward and plays in Zanetti who gets hoofed over by Bonera. Free-kick in exactly the spot from which Inter scored \u2026&#xa0;but this time someone is caught offside.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> GREAT CHANCE FOR MILAN! Bonera charges forward and pulls the ball back for Boateng, who catches it sweetly first-time but zips his shot narrowly wide. Close, but as Jesse Ventura used to say, close only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Cassano skitters into the box, but Bonera stands firm.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> At centre-back Milan have tried more combinations than an incompetent safe-cracker this season and at times it is showing. Milito gets clear and it's only Gargano's poor touch that allows a Milan defender to get a touch. That touch rolls back to Milito, though, and the Argentinian sprays his shot yards wide.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Mexes goes into the book for a chop on Cassano. Dangerous free-kick \u2026</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> \u2026 sand-wedged in by Cambiasso, but nodded clear by the Milan defence on this occasion.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Juan criminally gives the ball away 35 yards from his own goal. Emanuelson hands on to Boateng, who with the goal yawning in front of him sends his shot wider than a sumo who's really let himself go.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> De Jong thunders into Gargano and becomes the fourth player to go into the book.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> <strong>CONTROVERSY!</strong> Handanovic leaps out to punch clear and tumbles down after clipping Emanuelson. Montolivo sends back the most sumptuous of first-time volleys that whistles into the top corner, but the whistle has already gone for the non-existent foul.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> \"Why is the arch-enemy of the Smurfs playing in the Inter midfield?\" wonders Jack Adamson. I think you'll find that's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargamel\">Garg<em>amel</em></a>.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Emanuelson surges forward impressively but can't find Boateng or Bojan with his cross. That was a chance.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Bojan hops and pops in the area like a chip in a deep fat fryer. He works himself half a yard and forces Handanovic to punch his shot behind \u2026</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> \u2026 swung in but missed by Mexes. Meanwhile, in Le Classique PSG are 2-1 up after 25 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>PEEP!</strong> And that's half-time. It's been a contest that has intrigued and bubbled nicely rather than thrilled. A meat stew of a half \u2013 satisfying, tasty but nothing remarkable.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>PEEP!</strong> And Milan kick-off the second half. Inter have made a half-time change \u2013 Coutinho has been replaced with the Colombian Freddy Guarin.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> The entirely ineffective Bojan lofts a cross behind Handanovic's goal.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> <strong>RED CARD!!</strong> Nagatomo sees red for a second bookable offence. It was a village-idiot-daft deliberate handball down in the Milan half, as needless as it was foolish.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Inter haven't made a personnel change as a result of that red card. Instead, Zanetti has dropped in at right-back and they've switched to a back four.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Off comes Milan's Bonera, who looks like he's got a knock, and on comes Abate.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Cassano heads over to take a corner. A deluge of Milan fans behind the goal run to that errand of the stand to deliver a torrent of abuse.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> And the whole ground gets to boo and whistle now as Cassano comes off to be replaced by Pereira.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> An Emanuelson free-kick is (yet again) nodded away fairly easily. Montolivo, following up, belts a shot at goal that's wilder than a mountain lion who's just found out he's run out of milk when the tea is already mashing.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> And, a few moments later, he repeats the trick from the edge of the area. Those two Montolivo shots missed the goal by roughly a combined 281 yards.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Robinho replaces De Sciglio. Allegri brings his meat to the grill.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Emanuelson punts a cross behind. He's at least getting involved, but his delivery has been nothing short of appalling by and large.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Robinho can't quite connect with another Emanuelson centre. Inter have settled for this scoreline now. Can Milan break them down in the 30 minutes left. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E06cNv55jTs\">Anything could happen in the next half hour!</a></p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Although I'll be frankly very surprised if Milan score here.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Montolivo this time gets his radar corrected and stings Handanovic's knuckles with a long-range drive. Bojan picks up the rebound, chips to Boateng at the far post, but the Ghanaian international can only volley into the ground and over.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Milan labour to find a shooting position, but eventually the ball reaches Montolivo who again tests Handanovic's concentration with a thumping effort from distance. Bojan slips onto his backside as he attempts to pick up the rebound.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Rodrigo Palacio, prolific for Genoa last season, replaces Milito. And for Milan El Shaarawy is replaced by Pazzini, who swapped Inter for AC in the deal that took Cassano in the other direction.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Juan makes a fine challenge to deny Boateng in the Inter box.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Boateng lines up a shot on the edge of the box. This one smacks into Ranocchia.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> WHAT A CHANCE! Robinho lofts a delightful pass to the back post where Pazzini is clear. He can't quite stretch his right leg out far enough to connect.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Emanuelson drags a shot across goal. Corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> \u2026 nodded clear by Inter. It's Milan v a blue-and-black wall now.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> A RIGHT MADCAP SCRAMBLE! Robinho nods back across goal, Pazzini connects with nothing but Milan air as he swings at the ball six yards out. Ranochhia then botches the clearance, and Handanovic has to flap away under pressure from Pazzini.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Milan surround the referee in what can only be described as a monumentally hot funk after being refused a penalty. Pazzini cleverly drags a pass in to the onrushing Robinho, who goes down having been brushed by Samuel. It says here in this book of cliches that \"you've seen them given\".</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Mexes hoofs horribly behind the Inter goal. Inter have defended very well in fairness, and Milan have improved as the half has worn on.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Montolivo goes into the book ridiculously harshly for handball.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Ranocchia makes a FANTASTIC block on the edge of the area as Bojan lines up a shot at goal. Inter have less than five minutes to survive.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Milan work a series of throw-ins down the right \u2026</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Montolivo drives at goal yet again, it gets a huge deflection of Samuel and Handanovic can only watch as it spins <em>just</em> wide of the post.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Some lovely interplay on the of the box ends with the ball popped through to Robinho, who has strayed offside. Milan have really lacked quality tonight. Despite all the pressure, they've been hugely disappointing.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>PEEP! PEEP! PEEEEEEEEP!</strong> It's all over! And does that mean it's all over for Allegri?</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>Handbags in the centre circle?</strong> Sort of. Barely even purses, really. After the players drift apart Stramaccioni goes to celebrate with the Inter fans, while Milan trudge off sadly. In truth, the Rossoneri were awful. No invention, no shape, no real plan to break Inter down either faced with 10 men or 11, too many players who simply aren't up to the standard set by the club over the years. In particular, Bojan looks a player sadly destined to drift away from the top echelons of the game. The front four were incredibly average for a group of attacking players wearing the black and red. Curtains for Allegri? We'll find out over the next few days.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>Right, that's it from me.</strong> Thanks for your emails. Cheerio!</p>",
  "<p>The number of people who have contracted a rare and deadly form of meningitis from a contaminated steroid injection has almost doubled over the weekend, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>A total of seven people have now died of the illness, two of them between Friday and Saturday.</p> <p>Hospitals and clinics have been alerted to contact patients who have received a spinal injection made by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Massachusetts, to check them for possible symptoms of the illness. It is unclear how many could potentially be affected, but it could be thousands.</p> <p>About 17,700 single-dose vials of the steroid were covered in the recall.</p> <p>On Sunday, the CDC said there were now 91 confirmed cases, up 44 from Friday's total. The patients had received a shot of steroid for back pain, a common treatment.</p> <p>It could be weeks before any of the patients, several of whom have had strokes related to the meningitis, are in the clear.</p> <p>The rapidly spreading outbreak has re-ignited the debate over regulation of so-called compounding pharmacies, of which NECC was one, which mix batches of drugs on their own and have little federal oversight. While the FDA regulates manufacturers, compounders register as pharmacies, which are state regulated.</p> <p>It has since emerged that the therapeutic advantages of spinal steroid injections for back pain are far from certain. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/us/scant-drug-maker-oversight-in-meningitis-outbreak.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">The New York Times reported on Sunday</a> that the Cochrane Collaboration, an international group of medical experts who reviewed the data last year, found \"no strong evidence for or against\" the injections, leaving open the possibility that many patients may have risked their health and lives for little gain.</p> <p>Tom Carroll, a close friend of Eddie Lovelace, a judge from Kentucky who was one of the outbreak's first victims, questioned how the outbreak happened.</p> <p>\"This wasn't some obscure procedure being done in some obscure hospital,\" Carroll who is also the family lawyer, told the New York Times. \"They had sought out a respected neurosurgeon who had been referred by their family doctor, at a respected hospital. How does this happen?\"</p> <p>Lovelace, 78, had been treated at St Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, one of scores of medical centres and clinics across 23 states that have received contaminated products.</p> <p>There have been reports of several complaints against NECC and the FDA have confirmed that in 2006, they <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2006/ucm076196.htm\">sent a warning letter</a> over a string of health and safety violations included the misbranding of drugs and the copying of FDA-approved, commercially available products. </p> <p>The company, which is now closed, said in a statement on Thursday that despite the FDA warning, \"there is no indication of any potential issues with other products\".</p> <p>The steroid is known as preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, which the compounding pharmacy creates by combining a powder with a liquid.</p> <p>On Friday, the government released the names of about 75 facilities in 23 states that got recalled doses between July and September. But it is far from clear how many were sent to clinics, how many were used, or how many people who got one will get ill. Once a person is infected it can be up to a month before the symptoms appear.</p> <p>Patsy Bivins, 68, a retired waitress from Sturgiss, Kentucky, is one of hundreds or even thousands who have been warned to look out for the tell-tale symptoms of a splitting headache, fever, stiff neck, difficulty walking or worsening back pain. Bivins, who was told she may be at risk but didn't need to be checked unless she developed symptoms, told the Associated Press on Friday: \"Seems like there should be some way to tell it before you get the symptoms. Honestly, it makes me worse than I was.\"</p> <p>The CDC has said the outbreak may have been cause by a steroid made by NECC, where inspectors found at least one sealed vial that was contaminated by a fungus. It's not yet clear how the fungus got into the steroid. But officials, who have not yet completed their investigations, have told health professionals not to use anything made by the pharmacy.</p> <p>Tennessee remains the worst affected state, with 32 cases, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis-map.html\">including three deaths</a>. Michigan has had 20 cases, including two deaths while Virginia has 18 cases, with one death. Other affected states are Florida, with four cases; Indiana, eight; Maryland, three including one death; Minnesota, three cases; North Carolina, two cases; and Ohio, one case.</p>",
  "<p>Call them the believers. The three people who gathered at a Pittsburgh cafe on a sunny morning last month weren't merely supporters of Barack Obama back in 2008 \u2013 they were investors in him, full of hope for what his presidency might deliver.</p> <p>Iraqi war veteran Helen Gerhardt got to meet the then-candidate, and bend his ear about the Middle East. Her election day was spent driving African-Americans to polling stations: \"We had the music up, and we were partying all the way there. It was one of the biggest highs of my life.\"</p> <p>Rosemary Trump and Dan Beeton went to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-presidential-inauguration-washington\" title=\"\">presidential inauguration</a> in January 2009. They make it sound like a cross between an outdoor rock concert and a particularly weepy wedding: 1.8&#xa0;million strangers tearfully hugging each other on the Mall. Trump petitioned her congressman for tickets; trekked to her sister's place in Maryland; stayed out late at a ball the night before; got up at 4am to schlep into Washington; legged over security barriers to get nearer the action and remained on her feet till 7pm. Trump is 64.</p> <p>Beeton remembers peering at a giant screen showing Bush and Cheney: \"I thought: 'At last, they're gone!'\" Trump bursts into Happy Days Are Here Again and asks: \"How would you ever duplicate that moment?\"</p> <p>Ask how enthusiastic they feel this time and the responses are far more muted. Former Democrat campaigner Gerhardt is furious: \"I can't tell you how betrayed I feel. The people on Wall Street who have wrecked our economy have been let off the hook, while if you're caught with a gram of marijuana you're sent to jail.\"</p> <p>What about Reagan's famous question: are you personally better off now than you were four years ago? A pensioner, Trump frets about how younger members of her family will fare in the jobs market. Beeton mentions his partner, Amy, and how her business as a professional fundraiser has got tougher. Such anxieties are perhaps the common currency of life amid a slump, but Gerhardt's story gives some idea of just what devastation this one has caused.</p> <p>Finishing a postgraduate degree, she left the University of Pittsburgh last summer loaded down with student debt and unable to land anything more than a part-time job. For much of this year, she slept in her car. A badly dented Chevy parked around the corner from work served as her address until just over a month ago, when family took over the loans and a friend put her up in an attic.</p> <p>Obama is the very definition of a crisis leader, winning an election just weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and George Bush's panicky warning that \"this sucker could go down\". His job was to sort out the crisis. There's just one problem with that: crises have many causes and symptoms \u2013 which should the president focus on? Even as Obama was taking the oath of office, the economy's freefall was accelerating \u2013 so that by October of his first year, one in 10 workers was out of a job. Beyond that were a whole host of other crises: the bombed-out housing market, the out-of-control finance sector, the dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p> <p>Then there was the economic model which many, <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10268.pdf\" title=\"\">including researchers at the IMF</a> , argue gave rise to the subprime crisis: a country in which cheap credit had substituted for real improvements in workers' pay and conditions. Obama believers would have put fixing that one near the top of their list.</p> <p>There was never a hope in hell that the Crisis President could accomplish all of those. What dismays activists and economists alike is how little progress he has made: the big banks remain supersized, the housing market has largely been left to heal itself. Nearly four years later, the best that can be said is that he's overseen an agonisingly slow recovery.</p> <p>This is still better than Britain, which is stuck on the world economy's hard shoulder. America's jobless rate now stands at 7.8% \u2013 below the UK's 8.1%. And while the UK's annual national income <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12190.pdf\" title=\"\">is still about 5% below its 2008 level</a>, the US has made back all its lost GDP \u2013 and then some.</p> <p>Yet even the $1.25tn spent over the years by the Democrats on tax cuts, infrastructure spending and social security (not to mention the hundreds of billions pumped into the markets by the US central bank) has not been big enough, given the size of the black hole. As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, says: \"Government stimulus has allowed us to motor out of a depression, but it's not been enough for the economy to achieve real velocity.\"</p> <p>This leaves much of Obama's base no richer. Strip out inflation, and wages for the typical American worker are pretty much the same as they were five years ago; indeed, they've barely risen since the dotcom bubble burst. Whether Reagan or Clinton or the second Bush, the trend in recent presidential elections has been for incumbents to be re-elected. Yet according to the pollsters at Pew, the dismal consumer confidence figures notched up under Obama this year are easily as low as those of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr when they went for re-election \u2013 and lost.</p> <p>\"With an economy as bad as this, Obama would normally lose the election,\" says Dean Baker at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"And were he facing anyone less useless than Romney \u2013 Reagan, Dubya, anyone \u2013 he almost certainly would lose.\"</p> <p><strong>A tale of two bridges </strong></p> <p>Even that judgment isn't as harsh as the one delivered by <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/Senate_bio.cfm?id=1035\" title=\"\">Jim Ferlo</a>, the Pennsylvania state senator covering most of Pittsburgh and an early supporter of Obama in his battle for the Democrat nomination. \"Before you ask, I've already given my campaign contribution,\" he announces. \"It was a cheque for two cents.\"</p> <p>With the cheque (which Obama's team cashed), Ferlo sent a letter giving his two-cents-worth, accusing his former ally of \"flip-flopping\" on everything from healthcare to the suspension of habeas corpus. Then there's the cash from the stimulus package: \"The White House made getting that money so bureaucratic and cumbersome.\"</p> <p>What irked him most was something most Beltway analysts barely talk about: the administration's insistence on projects being \"shovel-ready\", with paperwork already settled in order to qualify for the stimulus cash. To prove the cost of that, Ferlo shows me two bridges a short drive from his office.</p> <p>One was built with Obama's dollars: a dinky footbridge that enables Pittsburgh's \"granola heads\" to walk over to a branch of the ultra-expensive Whole Foods. A small job, it was ready to go when the Recovery Act (the economic stimulus package) landed in 2009. Two minutes up the road is a bigger vehicular bridge that's \"unsafe at any speed\". Rebuilding that would have created more work and been far more useful, but the Is and Ts were not dotted and crossed in time. By Ferlo's account, there are several thousand failed bridges, locks and dams across Pennsylvania that could have benefited from Obama money.</p> <p>The curious thing about all this grumbling is how out of place it seems in Pittsburgh, which appears to be that rare thing: a city that has found a post-industrial afterlife, suffering much less from unemployment than the country as a whole. What was a steel town as recently as the 80s is now dominated by \"eds and meds\": universities and healthcare.</p> <p>Involved in local politics for over a quarter of a century, Ferlo can take as much credit for this turnaround as anyone else. But in his complaints about the lack of good blue collar jobs and grumbling about free trade, he fits the profile of so many Obama believers, who wanted his leader to do more than just keep a broken system upright.</p> <p>Just after the 2008 election, TIME put Obama on its front cover, digitally manipulated to look like America's last great crisis leader, Franklin Roosevelt. \"The New New Deal\" read the strapline, referring to FDR's reshaping of the economy. This mood infected the incoming team.</p> <p>In The Escape Artists: How Obama's Team Fumbled the Recovery, Noam Scheiber recounts an early conversation between the president-elect and Tim Geithner, his chosen Treasury secretary. \"Your signature accomplishment is going to be averting a Great Depression,\" Geithner tells Obama. His new boss replies: \"That's not enough for me.\"</p> <p><strong>The young ones </strong></p> <p>This election campaign has been much more focused on this or that gaffe and these or those figures than on such political dreaminess. The disenchantment is evident not just in the sourness of the campaign rhetoric, but also in how putative voters describe their choices. Across town from Ferlo's office, at Carnegie Mellon University, I asked a class of first-year undergraduates how they would vote. The majority plumped for Obama, but with no great zeal.</p> <p>\"People were more enthusiastic last time around,\" noted Myles Blodnick, listlessly. \"They used a lot of buzzwords.\" What worried the class more was the debt they were getting into to fund their degrees \u2013 in Blodnick's case $20,000 just to start his first term. Nor will they necessarily earn the money to pay it all back.</p> <p>At the Tin Front Cafe, I spoke to Mike and Steffi Stout and their 23-year-old daughter, Maura. The parents had also been to the inauguration (\"It was like a new world opened up; just for an afternoon,\" said Steffi), and could list ways in which the Obama administration had helped them keep their printers' business afloat. What worried them far more was what lay ahead for Maura, just a couple of years out of college.</p> <p>\"Maybe four people out of my class have got good jobs,\" reckoned Maura. By class, she meant her entire year's intake of 500 graduates. Her former roommates worked in fast-fashion shops, \"and they got really good grades\"; her graduate husband, Mike, had still not got a job so worked in his dad's construction business.</p> <p>Maura had recently got a new post, looking after accounts at a downtown hotel. The advertised pay was $13 an hour, but the manager added a dollar an hour \"so you can tell your mother you got a dollar for going to college\". That made $14 an hour, which her father calculated was the same as he earned as a steel worker in 1978 \u2013 and that's without adding four decades of inflation.</p> <p>In his inauguration address, Obama told Trump and Beeton and the Stouts and hundreds of thousands of others that a nation couldn't prosper long \"when it favours only the prosperous\".</p> <p>Such optimism wasn't for Maura: \"I don't think I'm ever going to earn as much as my parents. I don't think my husband and I will ever have the same life as they did.\"</p>",
  "<p>Vernon Bogdanor proposes a royal commission to investigate the relationship between ministers and civil servants (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/west-coast-rail-blame-game-principle\" title=\"\">The minister is responsible</a>, 6 October). Not a bad idea, if the government can overcome its rooted dislike of such \"time-wasting\" exercises. But a more effective and attainable goal would be to secure cross-party support for a civil service act, such as exists in most mature democracies. As long as civil servants are regarded constitutionally as the playthings of government, with no legal rights, ministers will always be tempted to blame them when anything goes wrong. They need to be made to stop and think. Civil servants need to feel that they are made of something stronger than putty. And both sides need to think harder about what the civil service is for and how it should be run.<br><strong>David Gladstone</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government's plans to cut facility time for trade union representatives in the civil service (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/05/francis-maude-unions-civil-servants\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 6 October) may have unintended consequences. A good union rep often foresees problems in new personnel policies that HR departments miss and offers early warning of these, and a well-organised union branch provides support on equality and health and safety law, meaning less expense to the employer down the line. The government's blockage of promotion to union reps on full facilities will also mean nothing to most reps, who know that taking up a post means a freeze (sometimes permanent) on career preferment. Union reps who get promoted in post are usually those who collude with management to repress activism in their branches \u2013 their reward often follows.<br><strong>John Medhurst</strong><br><em>Hove, East Sussex</em></p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Evening.</strong> Won't somebody please think of the defenders? Barcelona are apparently on a quest to eradicate the world of defenders and strikers, creating a sport played exclusively by midfielders. Not a midfielder? Nah, not interested! It's a strategy that requires an extraordinary amount of faith in your own ability to keep the ball and minimise the opportunities the opposition will have to attack your defence. Given that this is Barcelona we're talking about, that's to be expected. Yet even the best can be beaten. Even the best have a weak spot and it is not hard to spot where Barcelona's lies: in the centre of defence. Tonight, against Real Madrid, Barcelona are likely to trust Alex Song and Javier Mascherano in the centre of defence. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances, injuries robbing them of both Gerard Pique and Carles Puyol. But where is the back-up? After all, Real have Pepe, Raphael Varane, Raul Albiol and Sergio Ramos to play centre-back.</p> <p>It's hardly a problem that has crept up on them (here's <a href=\"http://www.thefootballramble.com/indepth/entry/barcelona-leaving-the-back-door-open\">a piece</a> on the topic written last year). Although Puyol's latest injury was unfortunate, he has struggled for fitness for some time and missed Euro 2012, while Pique has also had problems. More often than not, Barcelona have the attacking talent to overcome this dilemma, but they are vulnerable against the better sides, as they were against Chelsea in the Champions League last season. Sometimes Lionel Messi will miss a penalty. Last week Sevilla exploited Song's frailties and it required two late goals for Barcelona to maintain their perfect start. But it's only been perfect statistically. On paper. On the pitch, they are open. They can be attacked. They won't <em>always</em> have the ball. Real have Cristiano Ronaldo. </p> <p>After a slow start to the season, Ronaldo and Real are starting to hit top form, perhaps sparked by the late victory over Manchester City. Ronaldo has two hat-tricks in his last two games and he doesn't seem so sad any more. He has scored in five of the last six matches against Barcelona. Tonight he doesn't have to run at Pique and Puyol, he gets to run at Song and Mascherano. Even so, the pressure is still on Real this evening because unlike last year, they are the ones chasing. If they lose, Jose Mourinho's side will be a whopping 11 points behind Barcelona, which would surely be a decisive lead, even at this stage of the season. Even with this defence, Barcelona remain about as close to perfection as it's possible to be. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 6.50pm.</p> <p><strong>Kicking off:</strong> 6.51pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Scrap the preamble. Ronaldo doesn't get to run at Song and Mascherano. He gets to run at Adriano and Mascherano. Barcelona are basically asking for it. Real's attack could have a field day against this lot. The midfield isn't bad, mind you. For Real, Sergio Ramos has made up with Jose Mourinho - for now - and returns to the centre of defence. That's right, Real have outrageously picked some defenders in their defence. In attack, Karim Benzema gets the nod ahead of Gonzalo Higuain and Mesut Ozil plays instead of Luka Modric and Kaka.</p> <p><strong>Barcelona (0-10-0):</strong> Valdes; Dani Alves, Adriano, Mascherano, Jordi Alba; Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta, Pedro, Messi, Fabregas. <strong>Subs:</strong> Pinto, Montoya, Bartra, Song, Sergi Roberto, Sanchez, Villa.</p> <p><strong>Real Madrid:</strong> Casillas; Arbeloa, Ramos, Pepe, Marcelo; Alonso, Khedira; Di Maria, Ozil, Ronaldo; Benzema. <strong>Subs:</strong> Ad\u00e1n, Coentr\u00e3o, Kak\u00e1, Essien, Albiol, Modric, Higua\u00edn.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Some poor sap.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Pre-match emails.</strong></p> <p>\"I'm glad to see that in recent weeks Vilanova has let Cesc play in what is, after eight years in England, his natural role: a goal-scoring threat making direct vertical runs into the box,\" says SB Tang. \"That's also the role he generally fulfils with distinction for the Spanish national team, albeit typically off the bench. Cesc only looks like \"Emile Ceskey\" (a fair and Dr Hibbert chuckle-worthy call by you at the time) when he's asked to play the Xavi role managing the tempo of the game and circulating the ball from the middle of the park. I don't see much point in making him perform that function \u2014 in order to do so he'd have to, much like Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back, \"unlearn\" all that he learned in eight years in England \u2014 when the role he now plays so naturally after his time in England \u2014 the direct goal-scorer making vertical runs from midfield \u2014 is precisely what Barca have lacked.\"</p> <p>\"This must be a bit of a comedown after watching Stoke earlier,\" says Niall Mullen.</p> <p>\"Alexandre Song to Barcelona,\" says Stephen Bush. \"Has there been a single Arsenal to Barcelona transfer that has really made sense? Cesc doesn't fit, Henry was a squad player, Overmars and Petit a bit past it, Hleb a bit rubbish...\"</p> <p>\"It's about time Barcelona got punished for their sheer arrogance in team selection,\" says Shooby Taylor. \"They are an indisputably great team, but their attitude will be their downfall. There seems to be an attitude of \"pick 10 midfielders and we'll win\" no matter who they play against. I predict 3-0 to Madrid and an outrageous celebration dance by Mourinho at full time.\"</p> <p>I think Real are going to win this. I don't see how Barcelona can stop them going forward.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>The players are in the tunnel.</strong> A few hugs between them. Don't expect any on the pitch. To the Barcelona anthem, they stroll out on to the pitch and are greeted by a massive Catalan flag spread around the stadium. <em>Political</em>.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>We're off.</strong> Real Madrid get us going, kicking from right to left. Ear-piercing whistles greet their every touch. Barcelona manage to go the first 21 seconds without conceding. Hurrah! \"What will happen first?\" says John. \"A Pepe yellow card or Busquets falling over?\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> The first foul of the evening comes after 1min 16sec, Ramos bumping into Busquets. So there's John's question answered.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Barcelona are on the attack. Which is probably for the best. A loose ball breaks to Messi on the left. He feeds a pass into Fabregas's feet on the edge of the area. He twists and turns, but can't find a way through. Nor can Messi. He stamps his feet in frustration. This has been a very open start.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Ronaldo goes on the first run of many up the left flank but he's halted by a superb challenge from Busquets. He might have to do that a lot tonight. Once he's gone, there's no catching him. \"Star Wars references on the MBM!\" says Ryan Dunne. \"You certainly know what the stereotypical MBMer audience wants, Jacob. Any chance we could also get some Seinfeld, cynicism and tales of romantic desperation? I myself am hoping that tonight's game will be more entertaining than Taken 2, which I saw earlier (alone, needless to say). Frankly Liam Neeson was insufficiently badass for a man, let us remember, who trained both Obi-Wan Kenobi *and* Batman.\" I went to a party last night. Yeah. Check me out. I'm probably too drunk too be at the helm here.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> There's a real anxiety in the crowd when Real go forward. Benzema finds space 30 yards from goal, but fails to spot Marcelo in acres of space on the left. One pass and he was through. Benzema goes right though and eventually Ozil hammers a shot miles over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Marcelo dinks a fine pass over the top. Ozil is onside but the ball skips off the surface and through to Valdes. Barcelona's defence is so easily breached. Real are the better side.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> A crucial intervention from Adriano stops Khedira from getting through the middle after a fabulous reverse-pass from Ozil. He just about got to that and even then he nearly cocked it up, eventually forced into hacking out for a throw-in in a blind panic.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> It's not total dominance from Real but they are causing a lot of problems for Barcelona. Ozil glides through the middle with no one about to challenge him. He slides a pass through to Ronaldo but Mascherano expertly reads the situation and chases back to calm the danger.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Now Barcelona pour forward. Messi pushes a glorious pass through to Fabregas on the left side of the area. He's too wide to shoot though and tries to find Messi in the middle. Nothing doing. There are too many Real defenders back. \"While i'm never one to agree with Shooby Taylor, either on here or when we shared a house, he does have a point about Barcalona, (though its an axe he has been grinding for a good three years now without being proved right) someday they will be found out and once one person works it out, everyone will follow,\" says David Flynn.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Ronaldo, under no pressure on the right, sends a cross to the far post. It comes to Benzema, totally unmarked. Which is what happens when you play no defenders. The Frenchman, who scored a ridiculous overhead kick against Ajax on Wednesday, lines up another volley but from 10 yards out he makes a complete mess of it, comically miscuing it embarrassingly wide. Dear me, that was awful. But then, so was the defending. You wouldn't expect him to let Barcelona off the hook again though.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Pepe nearly lets Barcelona in with a poor touch in defence, tempting a tackle from Fabregas. Fortunately for the Real defender, Fabregas fouls him. Naturally he decides to stay down for a few seconds, milking the contact. He was so lucky there: Barcelona would have had a two-on-one situation if the tackle had been fair.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> \"A lot has been made of the Barcelona defence but it is a crime of epic proportions that Iniesta is being wasted in the front three,\" says Liam Moseley. \"Every time it happens a part of me dies.\" It's because Cesc Fabregas is Barcelona's Juan Sebastian Veron.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> After 17 minutes and 14 seconds, a chant about Catalan independence goes up around the stadium. They want it back basically. But why that time, you ask? They lost it in 1714, says Professor Steinberg, shamelessly cribbing off someone else's notes. There endeth tonight's history lesson.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Sergio Ramos has his head in his hands. He can't believe he's missed. And rightly so. This looked a certain goal. Khedira won a corner over on the right after a strong run. It was curled into the middle by Di Maria and Ramos charged through the bodies like Jonah Lomu to nut a downward header past the right post. Valdes wouldn't have had a prayer. Real have taken the lead from a corner in their last two appearances at the Camp Nou. That should have been the hat-trick.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Iniesta wriggles away from a challenge and rams one over from 25 yards out. I make that Barcelona's first shot. \"My enjoyment of this game is been somewhat enchanced by the fact my internet stream is being commentated on by what seems to be the late Sid Waddell and Boris Becker,\" says David Flynn. \"If its not them then i have no idea who i'm listening to.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 0-1 Real Madrid (Ronaldo, 23 min):</strong> Cristiano Ronaldo becomes the first player to score in sixth consecutive Clasicos. Try to contain your shock. This is was so predictable and a lovely goal to boot. Khedira fed a cute little pass into Benzema's feet on the edge of the area. He turned and then flicked a brilliant pass to his left to Ronaldo, who had managed to stay onside. He took a touch and then smashed a low shot inside Valdes's near post with Dani Alves nowhere to be seen.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Barcelona could be embarrassed here. They are a rabble. The lack of a defence is, well, indefensible. Real slice through them at will on the right. Di Maria breaks into the area and shuffles a ball across to Benzema, all alone in the middle of the box. Falling over, his scooped shot clatters back of the right post and Khedira pokes the rebound wide. Barcelona are all over the place. Real look like scoring every time they go forward. Barcelona do not.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> It gets worse for Barcelona. Dani Alves has gone off injured and is replaced by Montoya. The youngster has to try to handle Ronaldo. Good luck with that. \"Mr. Flynn, you don't mean to suggest that I have an irrational bias against Barcelona, do you?\" says Shooby Taylor. \"I hope not. Axe to grind or not, The Emperor has no clothes and people are starting to notice. If Kramer was here, he might say \"How could you be so stupid?!\" in relation to Barca's team selection today.\" Leave it lads, it ain't werf it.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 1-1 Real Madrid (Messi, 31 min):</strong> Barcelona might not have a defence, but they do have Lionel Messi. Real are furious about this, claiming there was a foul on Pepe in the buildup, but it was just terrible defending from the Portuguese. It all started, as it so often does, with a dart from Iniesta. He found Pedro on the right but his low cross was poor, directed straight at Ramos. But his clearance struck Khedira and looped up into the air and as Pepe tried to head it away, he made a fool of himself, misjudging the flight and ending up in a hapless heap on the floor. There wasn't a push. With the ball bobbling about the six-yard box, Messi reacted quicker than anyone else and smashed it past Casillas with his left foot. Real should be out of sight. They're not.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Guillem Balague is reporting that Dani Alves wasn't injured but that his substitution was a tactical change. Tito's trying to out-Jose Jose. \"The guy who sounds like Sid Waddell is a guy called Ray Hudson who commentates on some American channel,\" says Mark Welsh. \"I'm glad someone else thinks he sounds like the late, great Waddell. It's in his words 'uncanny' .\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Barcelona have been visibly lifted by the goal. Which is just as well, because they were an abject disgrace before it.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> \"Looks like Real could do with some central defenders as well,\" says Simon Townend. \"Can we send out JT and Rio to help both clubs out? These Clasicos are getting a bit too friendly after all, what with hugging in the tunnel and so on, they need something to spice up the action a bit.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Pedro is booked for catching Ramos with a high foot as they went in for a 50-50. What follows is some posturing from both sides. Xabi Alonso calms it all down. \"This could be The Knowledge material but I will ask it here anyway: in 2004-05, Mourinho's Chelsea had 1-0 lead at Nou Camp and lost 2-1,\" says Admir Pajiae. \"In 2005-06 Chelsea had 1-0 lead at Stamford Bridge only to lose 1-2. He lost match in Supercup this season despite being 1-0 ahead. Is Barcelona team with the biggest number of come-backs against Mourinho?\" I don't know the answer off the top of my head but probably. Generally you don't beat a Mourinho side once they score first.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Xavi dupes Alonso with a beautiful turn and gets a tap on the ankle because of it. Alonso is booked. They're supposed to be mates.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Jordi Alba gets clear behind Arbeloa on the left and skips into the Real area. He waits for support and then pushes a pass to the onrushing Iniesta, who gets the ball stuck under his feet. <em>Overrated</em>.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Half time: Barcelona 1-1 Real Madrid.</strong> It's not been a classic. Barcelona are very lucky to be level because Real could very easily be two or three up. Instead they've wasted a host of chances and Messi has taken the one Barcelona have made.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>\"Catalonia lost their independence in 1714? Are you mad?\" says William Kemble-Diaz.</strong> YEAH I'M BONKERS MATE. \"What nonsense. Seriously, it would have been best if you'd said nothing rather than sully the reputation of the Guardian by peddling stuff you have clearly not bothered to check.\" Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just repeating what I heard on the commentary. Or maybe I misheard. Anyway, calm down, you'll do yourself a mischief.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Hang on.</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/?q=1714&amp;src=typd\">Hang on a minute</a>.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>\"Barcelona an abject disgrace?\"</strong> says Claudia J Diaz Garcia. \"What the BAD LANGUAGE ALERT are you talking about?\" Marry me.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>\"If Barca are so bad why is it 1-1?\"</strong> asks Henry Carter. \"All Madrid do is counter, they cant put more than two short passes together. Ramos to Barca next window?\" Because Madrid missed three clear chances before the Barcelona goal.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>\"Obviously you should never type anything you haven't previously verified yourself,\" says Laurie Hu.</strong> \"Therefore I will expect commentary in the second half to presume that everything you here is a lie. 'A man who Sky claim is Lionel Messi appears to pass to a man who Sky claim is Andres Iniesta. All of this could be false, as I cannot confirm the pictures I am seeing are actually real'.\"</p> <p>\"Not the the first time Valdes has failed to cover near post. He seems to have some problems with it,\" says Yogesh Dashrath. \"I remember Van Persie scoring for Arsenal at near post among other examples. He seems to somehow have no idea where his near post is. As for the game, Madrid should win it. Barca are so afraid because of their lack of defense. If Madrid go for it, this match is theirs for the taking. Though last 15 minutes, Barca were finally playing mind.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Here we go again. And what a start to the second half! Barcelona lose the ball immediately from the kick off and Ronaldo is set clear down the left. His cross towards Benzema in the middle is cut out, but Ozil picks uyp the loose ball on the edge of the area. He turns past Busquets, who hangs out a leg dangerously. Ozil goes down. No penalty. It could have been. Barcelona attack and Messi goes on a brilliant run down the right flank. He beats Marcelo and Pepe but his cross is cut out. It had to be.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Real have come out strongly at the start of the second half. They know Barcelona are there for the taking and they're asserting themselves.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Check <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Successio\">this</a> out,\" says Shreshth Singhal.<br>\"Specifically, pay attention to: \"Barcelona, which had supported the Archduke's claim to the throne of Spain and the allies in 1705, finally surrendered to the Bourbon army on 11 September 1714 following a long siege, ending the presence of the allies in Spain. This is remembered in that region as the National Day of Catalonia.'\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> A lull. A lot of faffing about in the middle of the park. \"I'm no expert on Spanish history, but as far as I understand it, Catalonia as it is now constituted stopped being a completely independent entity in 1137 when the Count of Barcelona married the Queen of Aragon,\" says Kari Tulinius. \"The ensuing kingdom of Aragon merged with the kingdom of Castile in 1410 when the king of Aragon died without heirs and the Pope gave the crown to the king of Castile. Aragon remained a separate kingdom by law and custom until about 1714, when it was abolished and Castile and Aragon became the kingdom of Spain. Where to draw the line is problematic, and 1714 makes as much sense as anything else.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Iniesta is brought down by Pepe on the edge of the area - or was it inside? It could have been. It doesn't matter though. The referee gives a corner, thus saving himself a very big headache. Probably wise. \"A vague recollection of European history and quick squiz at the encyclopaedia suggests that 1714 as the end of the War of the Spanish succession,\" says Chris Ross. \"Charles II of Spain died young, in no small part due to inbreeding. Catalunya backed the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne.<br>Castillia backed the Bourbon claim. The Habsburgs lost, so Catalunya lost.<br>Had the Habsburgs won, Catalunya would surely have remained part of Spain, with certain autonomy, but not independent of it. I'm no enemy of the right of self-determination, but this 1714 just seems like a nice advertising ploy.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Busquets is booked for bringing down Ronaldo in full flight. He was running at the Barcelona \"defence\" 30 yards from goal. It had to be done. But Ronaldo might shoot, so the threat's not gone yet.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> After a long wait, the referee making sure the wall is 10 yards away, Ronaldo slams the free-kick straight into it.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Is there any point crossing when there's no one in the middle? No, is the answer, Pedro.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Sami Khedira has been booked. I'm guessing it was for dissent. \"Man, with all those references to famous battles in bygone days of yore, this is almost starting to feel like an Old Firm game from the bad old days!\" says Ryan Dunne.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Xabi Alonso is lucky not to be sent off. Already on a booking, he takes out Messi on the edge of the area with a cynical chop. He escapes a second yellow card. The referee fancies a quiet week.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>WHAT A GOAL!!! Barcelona 2-1 Real Madrid (Messi, 61 min):</strong> It takes something special to beat Iker Casillas from this range, but then Lionel Messi is something special. The free-kick was in a central position, around 25 yards from goal. Only one man was going to take it. With his left foot, Messi got the ball up and over the wall and it was hit with such wonderful curl that Casillas had no chance at all, the ball almost taunting him as it bent into the right corner. That is simply stunning. But then Messi is simply stunning. He's beating Real Madrid on his own.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Jose Mourinho's response is to bring off the wasteful Karim Benzema and introduce Gonzalo Higuain.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Barcelona make their second change, Cesc Fabregas replaced by Alexis Sanchez.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> I wish I was Lionel Messi.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> A corner to Real on the left. The stadium goes quiet. And then collapses in a fit of giggles as Ronaldo goes for the bicycle kick and makes no contact at all with the ball.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 2-2 Real Madrid (Ronaldo, 66 min):</strong> He didn't wait long to get his revenge and it's Lionel Messi 2-2 Cristiano Ronaldo. This is another fine goal from Real, although Barcelona are cut open so easily. Ozil slipped a pass through and Ronaldo, darting in from left to right like Freddie Ljungberg in his pomp, rams it clinically past Valdes. That's a quite brilliant finish. But Barcelona can't defend.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> A problem for Real Madrid: Ronaldo is playing through the pain barrier, because he hurt his shoulder trying that overhead kick just before the goal. He's going to continue though.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Messi wants his hat-trick. He goes on another superlative run, and plays a one-two with Alba on the left. But then he comes up with neither a cross nor a shot, a chip to the far post that goes harmlessly wide. \"I love Ray Hudson,\" says Graham Dow. \"He described Messi after the goal \"as constant as the north star and twice as radioactive\" and described Ronaldo as the \"iceman\" as he scored. Shakespearean.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Messi glides through the challenges again and feeds Iniesta, whose ball across the face of goal is put behind by the sliding Marcelo.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Messi is hassled and harried by Alonso, who is eventually penalised. What happened the last time Messi stood over a free-kick from this distance?</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> This time, Messi's free-kick flies over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Up the other end, Valdes is forced into a fine save with his feet at the near post by Higuain from a tight angle. There's no repeat of the first Ronaldo goal.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> We attack, you attack. This game is end-to-end that even the referee is struggling to keep up. Can you blame him? As Barcelona break, he falls over but is up to spot Pepe clattering into Sanchez. He's booked.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> \"I've always wanted to be Xabi Alonso. I think it's incredible that not one, not two, but THREE players in this match have played for Liverpool,\" says Matt Dony. \"Next season, will we see Henderson lining up for Barca, facing off against Madrid's Carroll? They'd fit right in.\" What I'd give to see Ronaldo introduced to Carroll.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Mesut Ozil is replaced by Kaka. He's quite good.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> \"Madrid will be kicking themselves (and probably missing) over their first half profligacy,\" says Shooby Taylor. \"Still, after my allegedly pompous pre match prediction I ended up putting a bet on 2-2, so I'll take this.\" Is Shooby Taylor a pseudonym for Sean Ingle?</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Alexis Sanchez has been caught offside three times since coming on. I'm not sure about him.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Despite the attentions of two Barcelona defenders on the left, Ronaldo wins a free-kick for Real on the left. He's holding his shoulder again.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Messi misses a great chance to set up Pedro for the winner, playing a through-ball just too far ahead of him, forcing him wide. With little support, he's stopped by Kaka of all people. Messi really should have got that pass right. \"The 3rd best player in the world (ahem) is also playing tonight,\" says Peter Corway. \"He's scored 2 goals in his match too. A nonchalant backheeled volley from a corner (not the first time he has scored one of those). And a freekick from 25 yards out. It's Marseille 1 \u2013 2 Zlatan.\"</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Barcelona almost win the match thanks to the unlikeliest of sources. After a spell of pinball on the edge of the box, the young right-back decides to take matters into his own hands and curls a ridiculously good effort on to the face of the bar. He's the right-back.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>90 min+1:</strong> Barcelona have another free-kick 25 yards from goal, Messi taken out by Arbeloa. Xavi takes it; it's deflected wide. Barcelona want the win, when you'd expect it to be the other way round.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>90 min+3:</strong> Iniesta is some player. He sprays a beautiful pass down the inside-right channel for Pedro to chase. He gets there, cuts inside and then fizzes a low drive just wide. Real are hanging on now.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>Full time: Barcelona 2-2 Real Madrid.</strong> It finishes Messi 2-2 Ronaldo. The spoils are shared after a marvellously entertaining - albeit tactically anarchic - match. Barcelona lose their 100% record but perhaps more importantly they keep the eight-point gap over Real, who will surely be frustrated not to have won. In the first 30 minutes, it looked like they were going to humiliate Barcelona, whose defending was risible. But there's no accounting for Lionel Messi. In the end, Real needed Ronaldo to rescue them and stop Barcelona from going 11 points clear. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Dark days are approaching for badgers. Since the government gave the go-ahead to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">trial cull</a> in an attempt to protect cattle from bovine TB, up to 100,000 badgers could be shot. Trained marksmen are preparing for the cull, which will involve using bait to lure the creatures out of their setts before shooting them.</p> <p>Yet subversive forces are never far afield. \"Jay\", spokesperson for&#xa0;the Bristol-based animal rights&#xa0;group <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop the Cull</a>, explains that since badgers are easily disturbed, noise and lights should send them safely back underground. Likewise, if they come across any people, the marksmen are legally required to break (ie disarm) their rifles.</p> <p>Police in Gloucestershire and Somerset, where the first culls are&#xa0;due to take place, warn that disrupting licensed culling could lead to a charge of aggravated trespass. \"In farms with licences we will not disrupt the cull,\" says Jay, \"but we will make sure it proceeds legally. We will wear hi-vis jackets, use very bright torches to film, and vuvuzelas to make sure shooters know we're there and we're not shot.\"</p> <p>Dismantling any snares would be a serious offence, says Jay. \"It used to be done with bolt-cutters but it can actually be done with boulders \u2013 which means you're not walking around the countryside with anything that can get you done by the police.\" Bait points, meanwhile, can be \"neutralised\" by peeing on them, as badgers hate the smell.</p> <p>Yet Lee Moon of the Hunt Saboteurs Association says that the sheer volume of people preparing to go out in opposition to the cull \u2013 hundreds are expected \u2013 should be enough. \"I think we're going to be successful,\" he says. \"This is not rocket science.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the apple- and grape-laden Yakima valley in southern Washington state, Latinos drawn here by fruit-picking jobs have become the fastest growing sector of the population <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014312959_censusoverview24m.html\">over the last decade</a>. Politically, however, the Hispanic families who make up the majority of this archipelago of 10 towns stretching 40 miles southeast from county seat in Yakima have virtually no voice.</p> <p>Two neighboring counties <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014312959_censusoverview24m.html\">are now majority Latino</a> and both the city and County of Yakima are nearing 50% Latino \u2013 up from 33% in the 2000 census. Yakima County ranks <a href=\"http://www.yakimacounty.us/about.asp\">first in the US</a> in the number of all fruit trees that are handpicked yearly by farm laborers \u2013 and almost all the field hands are Latinos.</p> <p>But despite their surging numbers, the anemic political representation for Latinos has stubbornly remained unchanged. \"The [Latino] population doesn't have the representation that it needs to speak to its concerns and issues,\" said <a href=\" http://www.electluis.net/\">state representative Luis Moscoso</a>.</p> <p>Moscoso is one of just three Latino Washington state legislators among 147 and in November he might be the only one. \"There are only three Latinos in the state legislature and two of them are retiring this year,\" Moscoso said. \"Unless we elect one or two of the other ones who are running, I will be the only Latino in the whole state legislature.\"</p> <p>In this lush valley, where some towns have as much as an <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/53/5368750.html\">80% Latino population</a>, representation is even sparser with only a handful of Latinos being elected to local town government offices and school boards. In the county seat of Yakima, where about half the 100,000 population is Latino, there isn't one Latino among the seven-member city council. </p> <p>Moscoso has been living in Washington for 37 years and has watched the Latino population boom. He says in that time there were fewer and fewer opportunities for Latinos to win an elected office. </p> <p>\"Particularly here in eastern Washington, it's difficult because we do have two counties that are majority Latino and three more that are nearly majority Latino,\" Moscoso said. \"And yet they are not represented in government or civic affairs.\"</p> <p>Currently across 10 counties in central and eastern Washington, Latinos are one-third of the population, but they only hold about 4% of local elected offices, according to research conducted by Whitman College's research program State of the State for Washington Latinos. In those 10 counties, 99% of the election systems are based on an at-large system, which requires candidates to run for office citywide and obtain 50% or more of all votes cast to win an election. Only 1% of those counties exist as single-member districts, where candidates simply have to win a majority of votes to succeed. Out of 1,891 office seats within those counties, only 78 Latinos hold an elected position.</p> <p>Latino leaders say a systematic form of voter discrimination has marginalized their communities. At-large systems are widely regarded to favour majority ethnic groups because 50% of voters can chose 100% of those elected. </p> <p>According to the National League of Cities, at-large elections weaken the representation of particular ethnic or racial groups, especially if the group does not have a citywide presence or are concentrated in a specific ward.</p> <p>Frustration about the way that the at-large system strips Latinos of their political power was an important factor behind the recent riots in Anaheim in southern California following police shootings. Like Yakima, the town is 54% Latino but with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/01/anaheim-mayor-latino-community-reform\">no representation on the council</a>.</p> <p>\"At-large elections unfortunately allow voting blocks with slim majorities to dominate local elections,\" said <a href=\"http://www.perkinscoie.com/dperez/\">attorney David Perez</a>, former assistant director of the Fred T Korematsu Center for Law and Equality at the <a href=\"http://www.law.seattleu.edu/x4920.xml\">Seattle university law school</a>.</p> <p>\"What we've found is for the last few generations the population in Yakima has changed dramatically,\" Perez said. \"But politics has not changed with the population.\"</p> <p>\"The main thing that was glaringly apparent in my research as far back as in 2005 was just how unequally represented the Latino population is,\" said Whitman College Political Science <a href=\"http://www.whitman.edu/content/politics/faculty/paul-apostolidis\">professor Paul Apostolidis</a>. </p> <p>\"It seemed as though very few people were voting and there was very low political representation from what you can see.\"</p> <p>Researchers say that the nearly politically invisible status of the Latino community is a result not only of the at-large system but also of apathy and what Paul Apostolidis, political science professor at Whitman college, calls \"extremely racially polarized voting\" \u2013 that is white voters refusing to give their electoral support in any significant numbers to Latino candidates. </p> <p>Numerous attempts have been made to level the state playing field. All have failed. Filing a federal voting rights act case is prohibitively expensive and takes a lot of time to move through the federal courts. </p> <p>Tony Sandoval, a Yakima businessman, filed a lawsuit in an <a href=\"http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015494862_latinos03m.html\">attempt to change </a>the city's council election system in 2011 but the suit eventually died in court. Also last year, a referendum to do away with at-large districts in Yakima <a href=\"http://www.yakima-herald.com/stories/2011/08/18/aclu-threatens-to-sue-yakima-after-voters-kill-proposition-1\">was defeated by 58%</a> of the conservative-leaning electorate.</p> <p>Latino advocates are now pinning their hopes on the <a href=\"http://fairrepresentationwa.org/wvra/\">Washington Voting Rights Act of 2012</a>, modeled on a <a href=\"http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=1307\">2002 California measure</a>, that is slowly winding its way through the legislature and that would allow challenges to the at-large systems.</p> <p>Through both state houses are Democratic-controlled, the issue remains hotly contested with an unsure outcome. Republican legislators are gearing up to defeat the measure and hope they can peel off enough Democrats to block it.</p> <h2>'An entirely new generation of voters is emerging'</h2> <p>Toby Guevin, an official with<a href=\"http://www.weareoneamerica.org/what-we-do\"> OneAmerica</a>, a non-profit immigrant advocacy organization that is supporting the voting act, says that Latino under-representation has negative effects beyond electoral outcomes. It breeds discouragement and apathy, polluting the entire political system.</p> <p>\"When the people you are voting for are never elected because of the election systems that are in place, when people who don't live in your community are representing you, when people who look like you aren't able to get elected at the local level, that has a really disempowering feeling.\"</p> <p>Some defenders of the status quo insist that Latino representation is low only because so many of the Latino field laborers are undocumented immigrants who do not have the right to vote.</p> <p>Not true, counters Perez. \"The vast majority of these new citizens are here legally,\" he says. \"The kicker is that the median age as of 2009 for this population was 17. This means that an entirely new generation of voters is emerging in eastern and central Washington, particularly in Yakima County.\" </p> <p>And almost all of them are US-born citizens.</p> <p>Democrat Pablo Gonzalez provides hope for change in the Yakima Valley. A 21-year-old American Latino now in his final year at Central Washington university studying political science, he is running for election as district representative. To boost his chances of winning, he plans to register at least 5,000 new voters before the November election. Many of them are likely to come from the high number of youth now able to vote.</p> <p>Rosa Hanson, a farm owner in Zillah of Peruvian descent who harvests mountains of Fuji apples and plump red cherries each year, has been a long time supporter of Gonzalez. In fact, Gonzalez used to pick fruit on Hanson's farm as a child. </p> <p>\"Despite the high number of Latino people here, we aren't represented,\" Hanson said. \"Pablo is a good kid, and he wants to do something good for his life, and he can be the one to do better for us and represent us. Young people are the new generation and our hope for a better future here.\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>Next month, 16-year-old Emily Barker publishes her first novel, Loving the&#xa0;Band. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2213370/One-Direction-teenage-fan-Emily-Barker-wins-Penguin-publishing-deal-Loving-The-Band-Movellas.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">Barker was commissioned by Penguin</a> to write the book after it&#xa0;discovered her One Direction fan fiction. Fan fiction is a craze that's almost as&#xa0;old&#xa0;as&#xa0;the web itself, but is currently in the spotlight because EL James <a href=\" http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/88272/Fifty-Shades-Of-Grey-Came-To-Me-While-Watching-Robert-Pattinson-And-Kristen-Stewart-In-Twilight-Says-EL-James\" title=\"\">admitted she started out writing Twilight fan fiction</a> before she changed the names Bella and Edward to Anastasia&#xa0;and Christian Grey and ended up writing the most successful sex book since Purple&#xa0;Ronnie's Guide to Doing It. Publishers believe they have found the next big thing in&#xa0;Barker's tales of boyband trysts.</p> <p>For those who still read proper books, fan fiction \u2013 particularly its romance-heavy strand slash fiction \u2013 is a self-publishing phenomenon where amateur authors and tween pop superfans write sexy stories about the celebrities they are obsessed with. It's a dark genre where Justin Bieber and Draco Malfoy canoodle on a moonlit Quidditch pitch and the members of One Direction like to five-way spoon.</p> <p>Barker is not the only one to find fortune from&#xa0;the genre: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/12/abigail-gibbs-the-dark-heroine\" title=\"\">Abigail Gibbs signed a six-figure&#xa0;book deal</a> when she was 18 off the back of&#xa0;her Twilight stories, and <a href=\"http://sleepingwithnme.livejournal.com/\" title=\"\">a blog of NME sex&#xa0;tales</a> \u2013 where staff writers would check out each other's 7ins \u2013 ended when the magazine discovered its author and gave&#xa0;her a job.</p> <p>Despite these successes, a misconception remains that fan fiction is just girls'&#xa0;fantasies scrawled on the toilet door&#xa0;of the&#xa0;internet. Fifty Shades of Grey has done little to rescue the reputation of&#xa0;the&#xa0;genre.</p> <p>But if anything, most fan fiction is a rejection of Rihanna and EL James's leather-bound version of sexuality. When most teenagers are&#xa0;faced with the miserable advice of sex education (put a condom on a&#xa0;carrot, use a mirror to look at your bits), or the&#xa0;miserable version of sexuality in porn, fan fiction offers a&#xa0;more honest way to engage with&#xa0;relationships and sex.</p> <p>Often, the most endearing thing about these&#xa0;stories is the way they draw upon the genuine experiences of teenage romance. Harry&#xa0;Styles never remembers to text back. Harry Potter is always passing out drunk before anything actually happens.</p> <p>At the moment, one of the most popular stories on <a href=\"http://www.movellas.com/\" title=\"\">Movellas</a>, the fan fiction site where Barker was discovered, is a sort of Hunger Games meets American Pie coming-of-age tale <a href=\"http://www.movellas.com/book/read/201208310438006725\" title=\"\">where members of One Direction compete to&#xa0;\"stamp the V-card\" of the story's first-person protagonist</a>. You might expect a distasteful and badly written tale of teenage lust.</p> <p>In fact, the story is a fairly merciless character assassination of the band, in which their petty attempts at sexual espionage are almost always rebuffed, by the same person who is making them&#xa0;up. A repeated device used to great effect in&#xa0;the story is Harry Styles getting kicked in the balls. Niall \u2013 the one who looks like a Guess Who? illustration \u2013 comes round to her house with flowers and chocolate, which quickly get \"smashed at his face\".</p> <p>The serial is ongoing \u2013 we're only at chapter nine at the time of writing \u2013 but so far this has been a story about silly boys and how to deal with&#xa0;them rather than an entry in a wet dream journal. These are stories as much about relationships as they are fantasies.</p> <p>One Direction dominate most of the fan fiction&#xa0;sites. A year ago it was Bieber, before that Twilight and the Jonas Brothers. These musicians and franchises are cynically marketed at teenagers and their parents as clean. When Disney was trying to promulgate the story that the Jonas Brothers were strict Christians who wore rings to&#xa0;symbolise their commitment to not putting it&#xa0;about, fan fiction sites were full of stories of girls being ravished by the band in incestuous foursomes. While Styles was made to apologise for a whispered indiscretion on The X Factor, it was vanilla to what he is whispering in teenagers' own imaginations. Fan fiction takes power back from a PR-obsessed industry and gives the fans free rein.</p> <p>Often the funniest blogs are the ones that pick&#xa0;on unlikely stars \u2013 Daria on a date with Courtney Love, the Doctor getting his sonic screwdriver stuck in a Dalek. One site, <a href=\"http://steadbombs.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Steadbombs</a>, is dedicated to Bombay Bicycle Club, the shy, even-tempered indie band from Hampstead. Rather than make them out to be the lotharios they're not, it plays on the band's obvious lack of laddish behaviour with stories of spurned inter-band advances and lots of crying. Guitarist Jamie is often slipping his \"soft, moisturised hand\" into frontman Jack's. Eventually the two of them have a child together&#xa0;\u2013 Flashygertrude.</p> <p>These stories are interspersed with endless photoshopped pictures of their heads on women's bodies. This is fandom at its most creative and cruel, with a sense of the surreal that you used to only get on The Mighty Boosh.</p> <p>Fan fiction is making teenagers better writers and better satirists, and allowing them to explore sexuality in a way decided by them rather than dictated by the entertainment industry. A purity ring doesn't carry much meaning when Ron Weasley is pulling it off with his teeth.</p>",
  "<p>FirstGroup is considering a legal challenge against the Department for Transport if Virgin Trains secures an extension of the West Coast rail franchise, amid warnings the government is running out of time to make a decision on the route's future.</p> <p>Virgin Trains is in the frame to continue running the London to Glasgow route beyond 9 December, when the contract expires, following the DfT's shock decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/03/west-coast-rail-contract\" title=\"\">abandon a handover to FirstGroup</a>. As the process threatens to descend into a legal quagmire, the alternative is a transfer to the government's in-house rail unit, Directly Operated Railways (DOR), which operates the East Coast franchise and is preparing for a West Coast takeover.</p> <p>According to legal sources, a Virgin Trains extension could be challenged under the Railways Act and EU law, with both offering FirstGroup grounds for a legal intervention. A source familiar with FirstGroup's thinking said a legal move against an extension is \"an option\". Virgin Trains said: \"Virgin's lawyers have made it clear that there is no issue about competition law in this.\" Under an alternative legal opinion, a temporary contract lasting more than a year \u2013 and unilaterally offered to any operator \u2013 could be deemed anti-competitive.</p> <p>A FirstGroup spokesman said: \"Because we have not yet received a briefing from the DfT to tell us exactly what happened, you would therefore expect that we are exploring all rights and options.\"</p> <p>The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, is also considering a transfer to DOR, which has deployed a team of more than 30 staff, including temporary employees drawn from the rail sector, to draw up plans for a takeover. A source close to DOR said: \"We are continuing to prepare for mobilisation should the department ask us to take over.\" The source added that DOR's handling of East Coast should dispel fears of a disjointed handover, but warned that the DfT would have to act soon. \"If we are asked to take over we shall have to know very soon.\"</p> <p>According to one rail industry source, both DOR and Virgin Trains need a decision from the government by the end of the week because franchise handovers or extensions require a minimum of 10 weeks' planning. The 9 December cutoff date is now eight weeks away, with the added complication of engineering work on the line over Christmas. \"This has to be signed off one way or the other by the end of the week,\" said the source.</p> <p>McLoughlin threw the franchise system into chaos last week after cancelling the award due to \"deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable mistakes made by my department in the way it managed the process\".</p> <p>Three civil servants were suspended, with McLoughlin claiming that the risk associated with FirstGroup's bid had been miscalculated. FirstGroup had offered to pay the government \u00a313.3bn over the course of the 15-year contract but the DfT&#xa0;discovered that the revenue and inflation assumptions used to vet that offer were wrong. This resulted in the department seeking a loan of \u00a3190m from FirstGroup to underwrite the contract \u2013 a number that the DfT now accepts was excessively small.</p> <p>The franchising system, where the government leases routes to train operators, is in a state of paralysis while the government conducts two investigations into the West Coast debacle. In the meantime, all franchise competitions have been put on hold in a move that threatens a repeat of the West Coast extension impasse.</p> <p>Four franchises are due to expire next year: East Coast, Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink. The RMT trade union has urged the government to bring those contracts under the control of DOR as they expire.</p>",
  "<p>Saracens scored their first try in eons but it was not enough to upstage the latest return of Gavin Henson. The fly-half, playing his first match in seven months, provided a moment of inspiration to turn what should have been a routine victory for the visitors into a tense finish that saw London Welsh denied the chance of an unlikely victory by a refereeing error.</p> <p>Saracens were 25-16 ahead and in cruise control with six minutes to go when Henson, whose main influence on the game had been through his kicking, both off the floor and out of hand, transformed an unexceptional afternoon with what has become a rarity in the Premiership: a jaw-dropping moment. Like a midfielder in football threading a defence-splitting, scoring pass through a knot of bodies, so Henson confounded the tightest defence in the Premiership with his skill and audacity.</p> <p>The 30-year-old was behind his 10-metre line, having gained some ground through a poor return of his own kick, and nothing looked on as he ran from left to right. Suddenly, without appearing to look, he floated a long pass to the wing Nick Scott. The ball travelled 25 metres, out of reach of the defence, and Scott caught it in stride, running over halfway and linking with his fellow wing, Phil Mackenzie, who had scored the opening try of the game seven minutes in.</p> <p>Saracens had been split to shreds and Mackenzie took out what remained of the defence with a perfectly timed pass to Tom Arscott. The full-back ran under the posts, performing a dive in homage to the absent Saracens' wing Chris Ashton, giving Henson with a straightforward conversion to reduce the arrears to two points.</p> <p>It was the first time this season that Saracens had conceded more than one try and they hit back immediately when Charlie Hodgson kicked his seventh penalty, leaving London Welsh to decide whether to cling on to their hard-earned bonus point or launch a claim for three more. The Exiles may have creaked up front, they may have conceded too many penalties at the breakdown and they may have at times overcomplicated play as they moved the ball in their own territory but one reason why their first season in the Premiership has not been a grim, solitary battle at the bottom is an almost naive indefatigability.</p> <p>Saracens were markedly the superior side but, not being known for doing more than is necessary, London Welsh were always in touch with at least a bonus point. They fell behind by nine points three times but kept using the ball that they had won, varying their approach, and they had the boot of Henson to put them in position.</p> <p>They spent the final two minutes of the match laying siege to Saracens' line. After a multi-phase move, comprising most of the forwards picking from a ruck and going for the line without getting very far, London Welsh were awarded a penalty. They opted for a scrum, as they did when Saracens were penalised for collapsing. When that scrum ended in a penalty for the home side, the Exiles' captain Jonathan Mills, who had been sent to the sin-bin in the opening exchanges for tipping Steve Borthwick at a lineout, went for another scrum knowing that another indiscretion from the visitors, who had benched their dominant front row, would probably result in a penalty try and victory.</p> <p>London Welsh drove for the line. \"I had visions of Gavin Henson kicking the winning conversion from the touchline to end a good game from him,\" said the Saracens' director of rugby, Mark McCall. The scrum went down but the 23-year old referee Luke Pearce, controlling only his fourth match in the Premiership, ruled that it needed to be reset and blew for full-time.</p> <p>\"It was the wrong call to blow for full-time because a match cannot be ended by an incomplete scrum,\" said the London Welsh director of rugby, Lyn Jones. \"To be fair, the referee apologised to the players afterwards. The scrum had gone down with the ball at our No8's feet and with us driving forward but as far as the result went, we were not at our best. To play as badly as we did against a good side and come out with a bonus point is a plus.\"</p> <p>Jones was happy with Henson's contribution, 13 points and a try assist. Some of Henson's intricacies did not come off and he occasionally shirked needless contact, not surprisingly given his injury record, but the pace of the game was such that he was able to last the 80 minutes. Arscott's try took London Welsh to 10 points in their last four games to reward for their daring. Saracens moved back into fourth but with Hodgson scoring all their points, making up for conceding the try to MacKenzie with a poor pass behind his midfield near halfway by running between two forwards for his side's try.</p> <p>It is 340 minutes since anyone other than a fly-half has scored a point for Saracens, a drought that would have ended had Andy Saull not knocked on as he reached for the line following Hodgson's break. Stunted ambition is not often punished in the Premiership but London Welsh, with Henson back in harness, are different.</p> <p><strong>London Welsh</strong> Arscott; MacKenzie, Lewis, Tonga'uiha (Jewell, 62), Scott; Henson, Keats; Montanella (Bristow, 70), George (Bateman, 49), Ion (Joly, 72), Mills, Corker, Browne (Kulemin, 51), Denbee (To'oala, 63), Jackson.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> MacKenzie, Arscott <strong>Cons</strong> Henson 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Henson 3</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Mills 3</p> <p><strong>Saracens</strong> Wyles; Strettle, Tomkins (Ratuvou, 57), Farrell, Short (Taylor, 70); Hodgson, Wigglesworth (De Kock, 51; Wigglesworth, 74); Gill (Vunipola, 47), Smit (George, 57), Stevens (Du Plessis, 62), Borthwick (capt; Botha, 59), Kruis, Fraser, Saull (Fenton-Wells, 59), Wray.</p> <p><strong>Try</strong> Hodgson <strong>Con</strong> Hodgson <strong>Pens</strong> Hodgson 7</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> L Pearce (Devon)</p> <p><strong>Attendance</strong> 4,685</p>",

The reasons are perhaps more straightforward, obvious and, at the same time, more challenging. The party needs to prove that it is committed to the public services and is on the side of ordinary families. To put it another way - our problem is not that we're too right-wing or insufficiently libertarian but that we aren't seen as committed to 'Britain's social contract' - to the NHS, to pensioners, to a basic safety-net.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100184051/david-cameron-is-hedging-his-bets/\">\u2022 Benedict Brogan on his Telegraph blog says that David Cameron's Andrew Marr interview show that \"he has developed the instincts of a hedger, who has learned through bitter experience the perils of promising things he can't deliver\".</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2012/oct/07/eu-referendum-eu\">&#xa0;\u2022 Nicholas Watt on his Guardian blog says that Cameron's rhetoric on Europe could damage the national interest.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every word uttered by every minister over the coming months should be directed at achieving those two goals.

Many Western countries are slipping back as emerging economies push ahead with energy and drive. Some will make the transition to this. But others will struggle with it for decades.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ed Miliband had no right to call himself a one nation politician because he had failed to reform his party.</strong> (See 3.46pm )</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Labour] has a Shadow Chancellor who would bankrupt the country again with more spending, more borrowing and more debt, it has Trade Unions that are running amok again, and a leader that is not strong enough to control any of them.</p> <p>Last week he made claim to be Disraeli. We know a little more about Benjamin Disraeli, a great Conservative Prime Minister, than he does. Disraeli was defined by changing his party for the late 19th century while Ed Miliband will be defined by refusing to change his Party for the 21st century.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Hague said the British people had \"firmly made up their minds that they do not want to become part of some kind of European federation\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he would announce further details of his review of EU powers (the \"balance of competencies\" review) later this month.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Tories want to negotiate a new settlement with the EU and then secure public support for that.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our party we are looking towards the establishment of a new settlement in Europe, and that will in time mean, just as it will for other nations of Europe in or out of the Eurozone, a big choice for Britain which must be a real choice for Britain and which will require the fresh consent of the British people.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Britain would launch a major crackdown on sexual violence in conflict during its presidency of the G8 next year.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are doing this because of the 50,000 women raped in Bosnia, who have only seen thirty of the men responsible ever convicted for it, because of 64,000 women and girls raped in Sierra Leone and 400,000 in Rwanda, because of all those in Colombia, Darfur, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo who endured this unthinkable violation, and for all the men and boys who have also been subjected to rape in conflict and have never known justice for it.</p> <p>For them and for millions like them who might be affected in the future, it is time to shatter this impunity. It is time to make it possible to mount many more successful prosecutions. The specialist team we are assembling will be ready for deployment by the end of this year, and we will call on other nations to join us in giving the UN and other agencies the support they need. I hope that across this party and across all parties people will join me in this campaign and take it to their hearts so that we can create a momentum that cannot be stopped and a lasting step forward in the condition of humanity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said new funding being announced shortly would safeguard the future of Bletchley Park.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Next week I will go to Bletchley Park to announce the unlocking of funding for its restoration, to preserve the memory of some of the greatest intelligence achievements in our history and at the same time launch new schemes to recruit the brightest mathematicians of the future. When Britain has built up a key skill or advantage in the world we must always do our utmost to develop, retain and enhance it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Britain was pressing \"as a matter of urgency\" for another international conference to finalise the proposed arms trade treaty.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was wrong to assume that the murder of the American ambassador Chris Stevens meant the Arab Spring was going wrong.</strong> \"I\u2019ve been twice to Benghazi where these killings took place, and my view is that the true face of the Arab Spring is not the murderers who attacked the US consulate, but the tens of thousands of Benghazi residents who took to the streets to demand an end to militias and violence,\" he said.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50719d6dc0e3aacd18e2f857\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T15:19:09.586Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's more from what <strong>David Davis</strong> told a fringe meeting at lunchtime.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Davis said that the Conservatives would only win vote by legislating for an EU referendum before the general election because voters would not believe a promise on this issue.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't think promising a referendum would win us 10 votes in the next general election because people don't believe us anymore. Every single party has promised a referendum then broken its promise, for whatever reason, they each have a legitimate reason behind it. But nobody believes us anymore so if we are going to have a referendum we must start the process now, before the election so that we actually say to people 'this is what's going to happen, this is the question, this is the tactic'.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government should abandon its plan to raise aid spending to 0.7% of national wealth.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With one or two exceptions, like spending money on India and maybe China, most people when they think, actually think, about the use of aid broadly approve of it. When it's saving children from malaria, when it's saving children from dying from malnutrition, when it is rescuing countries that are in dire straights.</p> <p>What I don't actually agree with the government's policy on is the 0.7%.

My colleague Polly Toynbee was left out in the cold, something an ungallant Montgomerie gleefully pointed out to his fellow Tories.</p> <p>Montgomerie made his case that the Conservatives have a mountain to climb to win the next election. The party had not won an outright majority for 20 years, and no government in modern times had added to their vote share while being in power, he said. This was something neither Margaret Thatcher nor Tony Blair had ever done, and the Tories today had to do it \"after making deeper spending cuts than Thatcher ever managed\".</p> <p>The answer, according to Montgomerie, was to \"look like we are on the side of ordinary, striving, blue-collar working people\". On immigration, Europe and crime \"the British people stand with us already\", but \"we need to be a party that is equally committed to Britain's social contract: the NHS, looking after pensioners, a safety net.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We need to be a little bit like Tony Blair - constantly invading other people's territory. I don't mean Iran, I mean political territory.\"</p> <p>But as the klaxons, cheers and boos of a nearby anti-government rally threatened to drown out the speakers, the man who really electrified the crowd was from the other side of the political divide: Marcus Roberts of the Fabian Society, who said that if the Tories want to win the next election \"you're going to need to address the [EU] referendum question\".</p> <p>And he added threateningly: \"If you aren't doing that positively, just watch for us [Labour] to do so, because we will be that ruthless and we will do what it takes in order to win.\"</p> <p>He said that there was a \"moral argument\" to holding a referendum based on the changing face of Europe since the eurozone crisis and a \"bureaucratic lack of legitimacy\".</p> <p>David Davis, David Cameron's former leadership rival and a voice of the right, couldn't agree more: \"Europe is going through a massive transition at the moment,\" he said, \"towards something we don't really want to be a part of: a superstate. We want to have a relationship with them, but we have to make a decision [on whether to be part of such a superstate].\"</p> <p>Davis said he backed holding two referendums. The first would ask the British public what they wanted out of Europe. This result would then be taken by \"negotiators\" to Brussels, and what the negotiators came up with would be put to the public. All this had to start before the next election, because \"I don't think promising a referendum will win us 10 votes in the next election - because nobody believes us any more.\"</p> <p>The case was most vividly put by the delegate who asked Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, to take a message back to Cameron: \"People that I meet believe that politicians are spitting in the face of the country over Europe,\" he said. \"They want a referendum and they are being denied it.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Tim Montgomerie, Chris Grayling and David Davis at the Tory conference <a href=\"http://t.co/7L9D3Qz2\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-07T13:03:39+00:00\">October 7, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T15:05:59.697Z\">at 4.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50717b1758f93d33437541cf\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T12:59:37.726Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 David Cameron and George Osborne have sought to defend the Conservative party's \"one nation\" credentials by insisting that the rich will be asked to pay more in the next round of deficit-reduction measures.</strong> The issue has dominated the first morning of a conference which will see the Conservatives contest Labour's claim that it is now the \"one nation\" party. In separate interviews, Cameron and Osborne both said that the Lib Dem demand for a mansion tax, or for a specific tax on wealth, was unacceptable. But, without giving details they suggested that there were other ways of extracting more money from the wealthy and that this would happen before 2015. This is what Osborne told Sky.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re not going to have a new mansion tax, nor do I think it\u2019s sensible to have a wealth tax in the sense of a sort of tax on your wealth levied annually. Other countries have tried that and it hasn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s driven enterprise and investment abroad.</p> <p>So we\u2019re not going to do those two ideas, but I\u2019m very clear that the rich will have to make a contribution to closing the budget deficit; I\u2019m absolutely clear that in the decisions we take in the years ahead, as well as dealing with welfare, as well as continuing to reduce government spending in departments, we are also going to have to ask the rich to make another contribution.</p> </blockquote> <p>Osborne said extra payments would be necessary because the government would have to find savings worth \u00a316bn in the next savings review. In a separate interview, Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, said that Osborne had increased taxes on the rich in every budget he had delivered. But the Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said that the Tories' decision to rule out a mansion tax was a mistake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oakeshottm/status/254884765046550528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>How do Tories define Middle England?

But he also said he would like to review the rule that allows EU citizens to enter the UK freely. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, put out this statement afterwards.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Cameron has become leader, membership of the Tory party has halved. Since he last abused Ukip, our poll ratings have doubled. The prime minister is once again showing his legendary lofty disdain for ordinary voters who rate Ukip higher than the Lib Dems - who must be an even a bigger waste of his time, obviously.</p> <p>The prime minister's blueprint for a new EU settlement is very confused. His claims to be able to change the EU rules on freedom of movement will be derided by anybody who knows how the EU works.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has described Andrew Mitchell's treatment of police officers at the gate of Downing Street as \"inexcusable\".</strong> Asked about the chief whip, who is not attending the conference because the controversy is still attracting media attention, Hammond said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every time any individual slips up, steps out of line, does something they shouldn't have done, commits an indiscretion, and they are a member of a party or an organisation, of course that is bound to reflect on that organisation. We have to accept that, it is very unfortunate. Nobody is defending Andrew Mitchell's conduct but a line now has to be drawn under it. This has been a very damaging affair.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tim Loughton, a former minister, said the affair had been \"hugely and deeply damaging\" to the party.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Council leaders have expressed some concerns about the government's decision to spend money on another council tax freeze.</strong> (See 9.07am.) The Conservative-led Local Government Association put out a statement saying that the freeze would not address councils' long-term funding problems, that councils should decide their own council tax rates and that Eric Pickles' decision to ban council from raising council tax by more than 2% without a referendum undermines the government's commitment to localism. In a statement Sir Merrick Cockell, the LGA chairman, said that help for councils was \"a good thing\" but that there were problems with this offer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reducing the current referendum trigger from 3.5 per cent to 2 per cent represents less flexibility for councils and even less localism with Whitehall decreeing what constitutes excessive. If local referendums are to be truly localist, they should be triggered by local people who can determine whether a council tax increase is excessive or not.</p> <p>Any help for councils is a good thing, but we have to be clear that this is a short-term offer. It doesn't address the huge long term pressures councils are facing including bigger cuts than any other part of the public sector and an immediate and growing crisis in funding care for the elderly. Councils could now have to budget for a further future shortfall.</p> <p>It is only right that councils take a longer-term view on budget planning and that decisions on the level of council tax are made by councillors who will then rightly be held to account through the ballot box.</p> <p>Councils care for the elderly, look after vulnerable children and collect the bins from our streets and in order to carry on doing this effectively local authorities need local discretion to consider the long-term interests of their residents before deciding if they will take up this government offer.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has defended the government's decision not to rush the review of airport capacity.</strong> Boris Johnson has claimed that delaying a decision about a new airport could have catastrophic consequences. Cameron said that Johnson was \"perfectly entitled\" to his view but that the government disagreed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We made a promise about the third runway in this parliament; we\u2019re keeping that promise, but we need now a proper review to see what the right answer is for the long-term interests of this country. This is a decision we\u2019ll have to live with for decades, and so let\u2019s take the time, let\u2019s get it right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron also said that he would like Johnson to do another political job after he steps down as mayor of London. (See 12.18pm.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Department for Transport has said that 250,000 season ticket holders could save an extra \u00a345 as a result of the government's decision to impose a new cap on rail fares.</strong> Here's an extract from<a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121007a/\"> its news release.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Passengers will benefit from a two per cent cut to the planned rises in the cost of nationwide train travel and travel on London buses and tubes following today\u2019s announcement by prime minister David Cameron.</p> <p>The average increase in regulated rail fares and the cost of travel on London\u2019s buses and tube network will be limited to one per cent above inflation for 2013 and 2014. Fares had been due to increase by RPI+3 per cent.</p> <p>&#xa0;This is expected to benefit more than a quarter of a million annual season ticket holders who can expect to have an extra \u00a345 back in their pockets as a result of today's decision. Many more holders of weekly and monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters will be over \u00a3200 better off over the two years.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T13:30:39.943Z\">at 2.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50717b0dc0e3aacd18e2f84a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T12:52:29.966Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6777bdc2-f8cb-4640-bc5a-26208ab267a0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349613908044/3112472b-67b2-46ca-beb1-c268c7776ead-460.jpeg\" alt=\"samantha cameron \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographers have been focusing on the most contentious issue of the day, Samantha Cameron's choice of footwear.

I have taken some of the quotes from the Press Association and from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron said that the wealthy would be asked to pay more in tax.</strong> Although the Tories are rejecting a wealth tax of the kind proposed by the Lib Dems (see 9.07am), they are prepared to make the wealthy pay more in tax. Andrew Marr said that, at the Lib Dem conference, Nick Clegg said that the wealthy would have to pay more as their contribution to getting the deficit under control. Marr asked if there would be any new measures that would hit wealthier taxpayers. Cameron replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will make sure that the rich pay their fair share, that the burden is properly shared \u2026 I'm not going to announce the measures here on the programme, but we will always be fair and seen to be fair.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, people who are the wealthiest will pay more in tax before the election Marr said. Cameron replied: \"Yes. And it is happening already.\"</p> <p>\u2022 But Cameron said he would veto a mansion tax.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you save, you buy yourself a house, you try to pay down the mortgage, you save and invest into that house, I don't want to be a country that comes after you every year with a massive great tax. So that is not going to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the wealthy were now paying a greater percentage of the total amount of income tax paid to the Exchequer than they did under Labour.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he would keep the promise he made at the election to protect universal benefits for pensioners.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be absolutely clear, the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he would like Boris Johnson to do another job in politics after he stands down as London mayor.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have said to Boris: 'Once you have done your job as London Mayor, don't think your job in politics is over'. I think he has got a huge amount to offer, a huge amount to give and I encourage him to do that. I think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said Labour had \"nothing to say about the deficit or debt\" at its conference last week.</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He played down the prospect of holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</strong> Instead, he said that he wanted \"a new settlement\" with Europe and that the government should gain \"consent\" for that settlement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The trouble with a straight yes-or-no [referendum] is that, frankly, I am not happy with the status quo, so I don't want to say Yes to the status quo, but I also don't think it would be right to leave now.</p> <p>I think most people in our country don't want to leave the EU or just accept how it is at the moment. They want a change now. I want a change now. A Conservative-only government after the next general election can go and change it, can have that renegotiation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said that Ukip was \"a complete waste of time\".</strong></strong></p> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said he was in favour of a review of the rules allowing immigrations from the rest of the EU free entry into the UK.</strong></strong> Free movement of labour is at the heart of the EU, but in an interview in the Sunday Telegraph Theresa May, the home secretary, said she would review this. (See 9.07am.) Cameron said he was in favour of this. The review would be part of the \"balance of competencies\" review looking at EU powers, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you ought to go through all of the things that we have in our relationship with Europe, and work out what is good for Britain, work out what we can do better, and work out what we want to change, and I think by all means look at that. Look, I believe in the single market, I believe in free movement, but two weeks ago, I visited two factories in a week, and I asked the question, \u2018how many people do you employ from other EU countries? What\u2019s the balance?\u2019. In one it was 60%, in the other it was 50%. Now heavens above, we have got so many unemployed people in our country that we want to train and educate and give apprenticeships to and get back into work. I think it\u2019s absolutely right to look at this balance of competencies, to go through every topic and see what is in Britain\u2019s interests.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he would veto a \"massive\" increase in the EU's budget.</strong></p> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said that eventually the EU would need two budgets; one for countries in the Eurozone, and one for countries outside.</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He suggested that he was likely to implement the recommendations of the Leveson report on press regulation.</strong> Marr said that in the past Cameron had said that, as long as the recommendations weren't \"bonkers\", he would implement them. Was that still the case? \"Absolutely,\" said Cameron.

Here it is.</p> <p><em>Q: Do you think there are signs of growth?</em></p> <p>Cameron says these are tough times for the economy. The deficit has been cut by a quarter. He is not a forecaster, but he thinks the economy is rebalancing. A million net new jobs have been created in the private sector. Britain is exporting more things.</p> <p>Last year more businesses were set up than in any recent year in our history.</p> <p>A global race is underway. Some countries will make it and some won't, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: But debt is going up. When will you get on top of that?</em></p> <p>Cameron says he inherited a deficit of around 11%. It is now around 8%. But the situation is still challenging. \"These are very difficult times,\" he says.</p> <p>Labour had nothing to say about debt and the defict, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: Nick Clegg said there would be more austerity after 2015. Was he right?</em></p> <p>Yes, says Cameron. The cuts will have to be decided before the election. The government will have to look at things like welfare.</p> <p><em>Q: So the squeeze in welfare will start before the election.</em></p> <p>Cameron says when the Tories came in some families were getting \u00a340,000 or more in housing benefit. The government has stopped this.</p> <p><em>Q: Clegg says he will not allow more welfare cuts unless the rich pay more.</em></p> <p>Cameron says the government has always been fair. The top 10% have paid 10 times more to reducing the deficit than the bottom 10%.</p> <p><em>Q: Clegg said he would persuade you to accept a new form of wealth tax.</em></p> <p>Cameron says he will make sure that the rich pay their fair share.</p> <p>He cut the top rate of tax, he says. But he raised four times as much from the rich by means like raising stamp duty.</p> <p>He will take further action to make sure the rich pay a fair share.</p> <p><em>Q: What will you do?</em></p> <p>Cameron says you cannot be expected to announce George Osborne's budget. But he will not introduce a mansion tax.</p> <p><em>Q: So the wealthy will pay more in tax before the election?</em></p> <p>Yes, says Cameron, and it is happening already.</p> <p>He also says the rich are now paying a higher proportion of tax revenue than they did under Labour.</p> <p><em>Q: Will the top rate of tax go down to 40p?</em></p> <p>Cameron says he will not announce the budget, but they have done waht they have done, he says (implying it won't go down to 40p.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50713e1558f93d33437541c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T08:32:21.806Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Do you have any thoughts about the Jimmy Savile story?</em></p> <p>Cameron says it is \"truly shocking\".

They calculate that the party\u2019s true level of support could be five points or more above what headline figures suggest.</p> <p>Second, they are confident that incumbency gives them an advantage. Their analysis of the last Election result shows sitting MPs tended to be insulated against the national swing.</p> <p>Third, they think they can be more targeted. In 2010, the Tories were trying to take 160 seats. This time, they are looking at just 40. I\u2019m told the list will include more than ten Lib Dem seats.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/daves-best-bet-is-a-repeat-of-the-1983-show-8200651.html\">\u2022 John Rentoul in the Independent on Sunday says he can imagine Cameron winning the next election.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is possible to see how the Prime Minister might still win through, however. It does not really depend on what happens at conference this week, provided it avoids disaster. The winning scenario was painted jointly for me by a minister and a shadow minister, in separate conversations.</p> <p>The Conservative minister asked: \"What if, in a year to 18 months' time, the economy is growing... but the cuts really start to bite?\" That is quite possible, and perhaps the parallel to which this Cameronian moderniser was pointing was Margaret Thatcher in 1983, when unemployment was still high but disposable income rising for the majority. It may seem harsh, but elections can be won even if a minority is suffering.</p> <p>The Shadow Cabinet member then said what the Tory message would be in 2015: \"Labour drove the car into the ditch; do you really want to let them back behind the wheel?\" The higher growth is, the more effective this message is likely to be.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9591161/The-Man-with-the-Plan-cant-keep-avoiding-the-Blond-One.html\">\u2022 Matthew d'Ancona in the Sunday Telegraph, who interviewed David Cameron this week, says Cameron could be overshadowed at the conference by Boris Johnson.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Throughout our interview, Cameron was visibly focused, poised on the edge of his seat \u2013 except when pressed on what Quentin Tarantino would call the \u201cBoris Situation\u201d, at which point he squirmed and gurned, seeking to end the line of questioning with the usual lines \u2013 \u201cBoris really is Boris\u201d, \u201cthere\u2019s no point trying to contain Boris\u201d, and so on \u2013 and an affable shrug.</p> <p>Sorry, Prime Minister: there\u2019s no point presenting yourself as the Man with the Plan if a hugely popular contender for your job is mysteriously permitted to say that the plan contains the seeds of catastrophe. Jovial appeasement is merely encouraging the Mayor. There is a clear and present danger that he will steal the show from the PM in Birmingham, and that Cameron will start to be seen as yesterday\u2019s tomorrow man, an obstruction to the Blond One\u2019s ascent to power. It should anger the Cameroons much more than it does that all this is so. They need to act, for once, as if they\u2019re mad as hell and they\u2019re not going to take it any more. If No 10 has a Boris Strategy, I can\u2019t see it.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/andrew-rawnsley-boris-johnsons-threat-to-cameron\">\u2022 And Andrew Rawnsley in the Observer also says that Johnson will cause problems for Cameron at the conference.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Johnson] will address the conference itself, a glorious opportunity for Borisovian grandstanding and an event that the prime minister will feel painfully obliged to attend. The compliment will not be returned: the mayor will have left Birmingham before Mr Cameron addresses the party. Cabinet ministers have to clear their conference speeches through Number 10. The prime minister's people would very much like to see what Mr Johnson has in store for the conference. One Number 10 aide says: \"He's talked to us about where his speech is going.\" In other words, they don't really have a clue. If it is comedy Boris, he will make the rest of the cabinet look even more cardboard and grey. If it is serious Boris, the would-be prime minister in waiting, that will be really alarming for Number 10.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/martinivens/article1142245.ece\">\u2022 Martin Ivens in the Sunday Times (paywall) says Cameron needs to take Miliband seriously.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like the American president, Cameron\u2019s vice is to sit back and fritter away his political capital when ahead. He switches the gears too quickly to cruise control. Expect him to come storming back in his own conference speech.</p> <p>Both men are fierce fighters in a tight corner but Obama \u2014 usually \u2014 does \u201cthe vision thing\u201d better than Cameron. On Wednesday in Birmingham the prime minister needs to convince us there is more to his own plan for one nation than austerity.

This could potentially save the UK money - but would effectively set up a two-tier Europe.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Cameron tells the Sunday Telegraph in an interview that Ed Miliband was \"signalling right, but actually turning left\" with his one nation speech last week.

You know, lots of attacks on wealth creation, but no ideas about how to create it. Lots of attacks on business, but nothing to stimulate it. Lots of talk about what was wrong in the economy, but not a word about the deficit. I thought it was rather an empty vessel, signalling right, but actually turning left.</p> <p>\u201cHe is using One Nation as a sort of cloak to...talk about some quite left wing ideas about business, about banking, about wealth creation, about entrepreneurship, about tax and the rest of it. The slogan only works if the policies go with it, and you can\u2019t have the slogan without the policies, or the policies without the slogan. And so, it seems to me, it just doesn\u2019t add up.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one nation - but it sounds more like East Germany than Great Britain.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/National/article1142432.ece\">\u2022 Theresa May, the home secretary, tells the Sunday Times in an interview (paywall) that the government is investigating ways of restricting immigration to Britain from the EU.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[May] is concerned that EU expansion and unfettered freedom to travel could lead to big levels of economic migration.

The cap, which will also apply to transport in London, is lower than the formula set out in George Osborne\u2019s 2010 spending review.</p> <p>\u2022 New legal rights giving householders who confront burglars protection from prosecution. Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, is expected to reveal plans to change the law, which currently only gives householders the right to use \u201creasonable force\u201d after campaigners, including this newspaper, spent years demanding action.</p> <p>\u2022 New powers for councils to stop unauthorised traveller sites as they develop. Local authorities will find it much easier to use \u201ctemporary stop notices\u201d against caravans in an initiative by Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, to prevent a repeat of long, drawn-out cases such as the closure of Dale Farm in Essex.</p> <p>\u2022 All civil servants to be offered a minimum of 10 days \u201cspecial\u201d paid leave to train as reservists in a bid to boost membership of the Territorial Army.

But after two days of travel, the U-turn seemed to surprise some, including a senior party official who got out of his car on the heat-baked roadside surrounded by arid scrubland and declared he had no idea what was going on.</p> <p>Others expressed anger, saying Khan was more interested in using the event to burnish his popularity before a general election due at some point in the next six months.</p> <p>\"I am very disappointed,\" said Khalil Khan Dawar, an oil industry worker who had travelled all day to get to the edge of the tribal agency. \"We had to get to South Waziristan. For him this is not just about drones, it is about popularity and elections.\"</p> <p>Some have also questioned the relevance of Kotkai, the town in South Waziristan where Khan hoped to hold his rally, to the drone debate. Most drone attacks now take place in North Waziristan, and Pakistani army efforts to wrest control from militants have forced many of Kotkai's residents to leave.</p> <p>The abandonment of the much-publicised attempt to reach Kotkai was the second sudden change of plan on the same day. Earlier Khan had appeared to reassure a largely female delegation of the US peace group Code Pink that there would be no attempt to enter the tribal areas and that instead a rally would be held in the town of Tank.</p> <p>By midday it was decided to push on regardless, apparently out of a desire not to disappoint the throngs of people who had joined his convoy along the road from the capital, Islamabad. That was despite the all-too evident disapproval of authorities who had placed shipping containers across the road at three different points.</p> <p>The vehicles, including buses crammed with supporters waving the red and green flag of Khan's political party, ground to a halt as throngs of protesters worked to push the obstacles out of the way, in one instance destroying a small building in the process.</p> <p>Indignities and discomforts are nothing new to the mostly middle-aged and female activists of Code Pink, some of whom have been arrested while campaigning against US drone strikes. But being trapped on a bus travelling towards Pakistan's tribal areas proved too much even for the most hardened of campaigners. \"We had only one toilet break in nine hours,\" said Medea Benjamin, leader of the 35-strong team of Americans who had agreed to join Khan on the march. They chose not to continue into, in the words of Benjamin, a \"chaotic\" situation.</p> <p>To add to their miseries, their minders urged them to stay behind the curtains of their bus \u2013 emblazoned on its side with huge images of people killed by drone strikes \u2013 throughout much of the journey, particularly in many of the areas affected by militant groups. \"It&#xa0;was hard for these people because they are protesters and they wanted to get out there,\" said Shahzad Akbar, a lawyer who was looking after the group. \"But there's no way we are going to let them get out in some of those towns!\"</p> <p>Billed as a protest against drone strikes, which Khan and his supporters claim kill large numbers of innocent civilians as well as flouting Pakistan's sovereignty, the procession had the feel of a political rally on wheels. Many of the vehicles eschewed anti-drone slogans and instead carried pictures of PTI politicians anxious to be included on the party's official ticket in the upcoming elections.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong> </p> <p>The Economist <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21564229\">this week describes</a> the intensifying suffering of 75 million Iranian citizens as a result of the sanctions regime being imposed on them by the US and its allies [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Six years ago, when America and Europe were putting in place the first raft of measures to press Iran to come clean over its nuclear ambitions, the talk was of \"smart\" sanctions. The West, it was stressed, had no quarrel with the Iranian people\u2014only with a regime that seemed bent on getting a nuclear bomb, or at least the capacity for making one. Yet, as sanctions have become increasingly punitive in the face of Iran's intransigence, <em>it is ordinary Iranians who are paying the price</em>.</p> <p>\"On October 1st and 2nd Iran's rial lost more than 25% of its value against the dollar. Since the end of last year it has depreciated by over 80%, most of that in just the past month. Despite subsidies intended to help the poor, prices for staples, such as milk, bread, rice, yogurt and vegetables, have at least doubled since the beginning of the year. Chicken has become so scarce that when scant supplies become available they prompt riots. On October 3rd police in Tehran fired tear-gas at people demonstrating over the rial's collapse. The city's main bazaar closed because of the impossibility of quoting accurate prices. . . . </p> <p>\"Unemployment is thought to be around three times higher than the official rate of 12%, and millions of unskilled factory workers are on wages well below the official poverty line of 10m rials (about $300) a month.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Pervasive unemployment, inflation, medicine shortages, and even food riots have been <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/08/16/158831342/from-all-sides-iran-under-siege\">reported</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/sanctions-iran-ordinary-people-target\">elsewhere</a>.</p> <p>That sanctions on Muslim countries cause mass human suffering is not only inevitable but part of their design. In 2006, the senior Israeli official Dov Weisglass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/16/israel\">infamously described</a> the purpose of his nation's blockade on Gaza with this candid admission: \"'The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.\" Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman justified the Iran sanctions regime <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/113375-new-sanction-on-iran-must-be-enforced-rep-brad-sherman\">this way</a>: \"Critics of sanctions argue that these measures will hurt the Iranian people. <em>Quite frankly, we need to do just that</em>.\"</p> <p>Even more infamously, the beloved former Democratic Secretary of State Madeleine Albright - when asked in 1996 by 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl about reports that 500,000 Iraqi children had died as a result of US-imposed sanctions on that country - <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084\">stoically replied</a>: \"I think this is a very hard choice, but the price - we think the price is worth it.\" So extreme was the suffering caused by sanctions in Iraq that one former UN official, Denis Halliday, resigned in protest, <a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/99/9.30.99/Halliday_talk.html\">saying that</a> the sanctions policy met the formal definition of \"genocide\":</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We are now in there responsible for killing people, destroying their families, their children, allowing their older parents to die for lack of basic medicines. We're in there allowing children to die who were not born yet when Saddam Hussein made the mistake of invading Kuwait.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/201210373854792889.html\">excellent Op-Ed for Al Jazeera</a> last week, Murtaza Hussain extensively documented the devastation wrought on 26 million Iraqis by that sanctions regime - the one Albright declared as \"worth it\" - and argues: \"that tragedy is being willfully replayed, only this time the target is the population of Iran\". He explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Intensifying sanctions against the country have sent the Iran's rial into an unprecedented free-fall, causing it to plummet in value by 75 per cent since the start of the year; and, stunningly, almost 60 per cent in the past week alone.</p> <p>\"Ordinary Iranians completely unconnected to the government have had their lives effectively ground to a halt as the sudden and unprecedented collapse of the financial system has rendered any meaningful form of commerce effectively impossible. In recent weeks, the price of staples such as rice and cooking oil have skyrocketed and once ubiquitous foods such as chicken have been rendered completely out of the reach of the average citizen.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is a fact that should be deeply disturbing to any decent person. In 2001, the writer Chuck Sudetic visited Iraq and then <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2001/11/betrayal-basra\">wrote in Mother Jones</a> about what he saw: namely, that the US-led sanctions regime \"killed more civilians than all the chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons used in human history\". </p> <p>Yet as Hussain notes, the decade-long suffering of Iraqis was all futile when viewed next to the ostensible goal of sanctions: \"the sanctions failed to remove Saddam from power and by many accounts helped him solidify his grip on the country by keeping the overwhelming majority of the population focused purely on subsistence.\" Some isolated exceptions notwithstanding, the very idea that a regime can be undermined by severely weakening the population that would otherwise oppose it - literally weakening them physically through food and medicine deprivation - is not only intuitively absurd and morally grotesque but also empirically disproven. </p> <p>As Mohammad Sadeghi Esfahlani and Jamal Abdi <a href=\"http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/02/sanctions_cripple_irans_middle_class_not_the_regime\">recently documented</a> in Foreign Policy, the sanctions regime, while devastating ordinary Iranians, is having virtually no effect on their leaders - other than to strengthen their grip on power:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Instead of speculating from afar, we should listen to the Iranians on the ground who are actually struggling for democracy firsthand. The leaders of the Green Movement and Iranian human rights and democracy defenders have adamantly opposed broad sanctions and warned that confrontation, isolation and broad economic punishment only undermine the cause of democracy and rule of law in Iran. A new report by the International Civil Society Action Network (ICAN) documents how sanctions are destroying the sources of societal change in Iran. 'The urban middle class that has historically played a central role in creating change and promoting progress in Iran are key casualties of the sanctions regime,' according to the report. </p> <p>\"As documented by the report's firsthand account on the ground, sanctions are not driving the working class to join Iran's democracy movement, they are doing the opposite - decimating the Iranian middle class, that has been at the center of the democracy movement, by intensifying their economic struggles. The greatest impediment for Iran's pro-democracy movement - as we saw at the height of the Green Movement protests in 2009 - has been that working class Iranians who are preoccupied with immediate financial struggles are unable to enlist in a struggle for political freedoms.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So horrific is the human suffering brought about by such sanctions regimes that some are beginning to argue that killing Iranians with an air attack would be more humane. That was the argument advanced several days ago by the managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine, Blake Hounsehll, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/254065322376691715\">who mused</a> that he was \"beginning to wonder if limited airstrikes on Iran may actually be the more morally sound course of action.\" He was contemplating airstrikes, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/254065792059052032\">then explained</a>, because \"a couple thousand deaths\" might be worth it to avoid \"the livelihoods of 75 million people destroyed\".</p> <p>Part of Hounshell's announcement is simply the way America's foreign policy elites so casually call for actions that they know will end the lives of large numbers of innocent human beings: it may be time to cause \"a copule thousand deaths\", he suggested with an almost audible yawn. And part of it is what Council on Foreign Relations president emiritus Leslie Gelb <a href=\"http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/the-international-relations-academy-and-the-beltway-foreign-policy-community-why-the-disconnect/\">candidly described</a> as \"the disposition and incentives\" among America's foreign policy professionals \"to support wars to retain political and professional credibility\". In other words, supporting military action is what America's influential foreign policy commentators, by definition, reflexively do in order to advance their own career and make themselves relevant.</p> <p>But part of Hounshell's statement reflects the difficult-to-dispute recognition on his part that the sanctions regime causes such intense, widespread human misery that - in the warped Washington world in which airstrikes and sanctions are the only two cognizable options - extinguishing the lives of \"a couple thousand\" innocent Iranians may actually be the more humanitarian outcome when weighed against the ongoing suffering of 75 million people from the sanctions regime. That is how devastating sanctions are.</p> <p>What's most extraordinary about all of this is that the extreme human suffering caused by US-led sanctions is barely acknowledged in mainstream American political discourse. One reason that Americans were so baffled after the 9/11 attack (<em>why do they hate us?</em>) is the same reason they continue to be so baffled by anti-American protests in the Muslim world (<em>what are they so angry about?</em>): namely, most Americans literally have no idea, because nobody ever told them, that their government's imposition of sanctions in Iraq led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children, and they similarly have no idea that the suffering of ordinary Iranians is becoming increasingly substantial.</p> <p>People in the Muslim world (who are relentlessly depicted as propagandized) are well aware of the human devastation US sanctions have caused, while Americans (who think of themselves as the beneficiaries of a free and vibrant press) have largely had those facts kept from them. That dynamic in part, is what often explains the irreconcilable worldviews among people in those two parts of the world.</p> <p>As usual, don't look for Democratic partisan to object to any of this. To the extent that they <a href=\"http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2012/02/23/10486494-the-safety-of-americas-enemies?lite\">talk about the sanctions regime at all</a>, it is <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/report/obama-foreign-policy-successes/\">typically to <em>celebrate it</em></a>: as proof of Barack Obama's \"toughness\" and his fealty to Israeli interests. So just as was true during the Clinton years, when very few Democratic partisans even bothered to acknowledge (let alone oppose) the lethal devastation wrought on Iraqi civilians, few now even consider the notion that sanctions are strategically unwise and morally indefensible, and when they discuss it at all, they praise Obama for putting the clamps on the Iranian economy.</p> <p>In essence, the same mentality that drives <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/repulsive_progressive_hypocrisy/\">Democratic support for drones</a> sustains Democratic support for sanctions: they tacitly embrace the unexamined assumption that the US is inevitably going to engage in aggression and kill Muslims, and then <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fEmXlnfW6vc/UG7-9UE5PyI/AAAAAAAAHI8/sTO8gBZPIBo/s1600/droney.png\">pat themselves on the back</a> for cheering for the way that kills the fewest (<em>I support drones because they're better than full-scale invasions; I support sanctions because they're better than air strikes</em>). They are seemingly incapable of conceiving of a third alternative: that the US could or should refrain from killing innocent people in predominantly Muslim countries.</p> <p>Democratic support for sanctions on Iran shares another attribute with the pro-drone mentality. No matter how many times it is documented that drones do not decrease the threat of terrorism but rather increase that threat - by generating the anti-American hatred that drives terrorism - drone advocates insist: <em>we must do this to stop the terrorists</em>. </p> <p>Identically, no matter how many times it is documented that Iraq sanctions actually strengthened Saddam's regime by literally starving the opposition and making them more reliant on regime support, sanctions advocates insist: <em>we must impose sanctions, and harm ordinary Iranians, in order to remove Iran's regime</em>. It is exactly like showing a lung cancer patient studies that prove that smoking causes lung cancer, and then sitting back while they insist that they will increase their cigarette intake in order to combat their cancer.</p> <p>Even if it were true that sanctions produces less civilian harm than all-out air strikes on Iran, that would not justify sanctions. But as evidence of the sanctions-caused human suffering in Iran mounts, even the premise of that claim, irrelevant though it is, seems less and less convincing.</p> <h2>Drone terrorism</h2> <p>Pakistan's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/magazine/pakistans-imran-khan-must-be-doing-something-right.html?pagewanted=all\">most popular politician</a>, Imran Khan, was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/world/asia/americans-join-pakistan-convoy-to-protest-drone-strikes.html?_r=0\">joined yesterday</a> by 32 brave Americans in an anti-drone march to Waziristan, at which Khan said: \"The war on terror has become a war of terror.\" Khan <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/10/05-2\">also vowed</a> that if elected Prime Minister, he would shoot down US drones that invaded Pakistani air space. To see why the US drone campaign is appropriately deemed one of terror, see <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com.br/2012/10/droney-comes-to-visit.html\">this excellent analysis from Digby</a>.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>I have one other question: if \"terrorism\" means the use of violence aimed at civilians in order to induce political change from their government, what is it called when intense economic suffering is imposed on a civilian population in order to induce political change from their government? Can those two tactics be morally distinguished?</p>",
  "<p>South Africa's Branden Grace won for the fifth time this year, capturing the Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews by two shots from Thorbjorn Olesen.</p> <p>The 24-year-old from Pretoria, who only got his tour card for 2012 at qualifying school last winter, began the week with a European Tour record-equalling 60 at Kingsbarns \u2013 the \u00a33m pro-celebrity event is staged over three courses \u2013 and was never overtaken after that.</p> <p>Denmark's Olesen did catch him with seven holes to go, but Grace promptly birdied the next three holes and with another at the last, he finished with a tournament-record-equalling 22-under total.</p> <p>Alexander Noren of Sweden was third on 18-under, his countryman Joel Sjoholm fourth at 16-under while the Scot Stephen Gallacher, winner in 2004, had been fourth on his own and held hopes of catching Grace when he played the wrong ball at the 16th, incurring a two-stroke penalty and running up a quadruple-bogey eight.</p> <p>\"It never even crossed my mind [it was the wrong ball] because he was looking 50 yards further up,\" Gallacher said. \"Obviously I'm a bit disappointed, but what can you do?\" He had also incurred a penalty in Thursday's round when in taking a practice swing he clipped a divot and it hit his ball. A birdie at the last did at least enable him to finish in a seven-way tie for fifth.</p> <p>Like the 2010 Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and the 2011 US Masters winner Charl Schwartzel, Grace is a product of the Ernie Els Foundation and the current Open champion has already tipped him to be another major champion.</p> <p>\"I've really dreamt of this moment my whole life,\" Grace said. \"I had goosebumps thinking this morning about Louis [winning on the Old Course] and the possibility of holding a trophy here myself. It was a tough day, but the putter started working and that's all I needed to do.\"</p> <p>Grace's caddie Zack Rasego was on Oosthuizen's bag two years ago and after asking Rasego to start reading the lines with him on the back nine the South African closed the tournament out with a 70 while Olesen had a 68.</p> <p>\"It feels awesome,\" said Grace, who has risen from outside the world's top 300 to inside the top 40 and might even deny the No1 Rory McIlroy the European money list title next month. The South African is up from 12th to third and he added: \"It's definitely in my sights.\"</p>",
  "<p>If the wind blowing across the New Mexico desert drops, a 43-year-old Austrian man will step out of a small silver capsule on Tuesday and attempt to make history. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/sep/05/felix-baumgartner-michel-fournier-supersonic\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner is to jump</a> from the largest helium-filled balloon ever built for manned flight and hurtle towards the Earth from near the edge of space, 23 miles up.

A weekend dress rehearsal went well and the forecast looks good for Tuesday. There have been two test jumps, including one in July from just over 90,000ft up.</p> <p>Images of the team working round the clock from mission control in Roswell look exactly like a Nasa space launch, and the team includes many former Nasa scientists. Also assisting is the formidable <a href=\"http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/Article/Red-Bull-Stratos-Meet-the-record-holder-Joe-Kittinger-021243197104122\" title=\"\">current record holder</a>, Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 as a US air force pilot, jumped from a balloon at 102,800ft.

At least one man has died trying to break his record, and Kittinger says he gets several phone calls a month from people who want to attempt the challenge.</p> <p>Baumgartner will go up in a specially designed capsule wearing a spacesuit. As the moment comes to open the door, the pressure in the capsule will be switched off, and the spacesuit's own system will take over \u2013 a moment, the Austrian has said, \"when you can feel your body just does not want to be there\".</p> <p>Kittinger greeted him with a hug after the July test, but clearly thinks this is freefall for softies: \"I went up in an open gondola, and Felix is going up in a very sophisticated space capsule \u2026 He's going up in luxury, he's going up in a Cadillac by comparison with what we did 51 years ago.\"</p> <p>Baumgartner has already racked up a string of records, including in 1999 jumping from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, then the tallest buildings in the world. He also has the record for the lowest-altitude jump, from the left hand of the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro in 2001. In 2003 he became the first to skydive across the English Channel, using a carbon fibre wing, and he has jumped from a cliff into the stygian depths of a cave in Croatia.</p> <p>\"I am that type of person who wants to enjoy life,\" Baugartner said. His mother did get a bit anxious about it all, he admitted. She will be at Roswell to watch the attempt. \"She says 'If something goes wrong, at least I can hold you in my hands one more time' \u2026 I really don't want to put my mom in that spot, and that means I really have to stay alive.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has rejected Liberal Democrat calls for a mansion tax as part of efforts to tackle the deficit, but vowed that the rich would \"pay their fair share\".</p> <p>In comments set to stoke tensions within the coalition government, Cameron used an interview before the Conservative party's annual conference in Birmingham to confirm that further welfare cuts were up for grabs \u2013 something that Nick Clegg said he would permit only if wealth taxes were imposed on the rich.</p> <p>But Cameron ruled out the prospect of a mansion tax, echoing George Osborne's insistence that the coalition would not implement wealth taxes, on the grounds that they would be unfair. In <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2213936/My-tax-gift-Middle-England-Osborne-pledges-NO-mansion-tax-NO-wealth-tax-FREEZE-council-tax.html\" title=\"\">an interview with the Mail on Sunday</a>, Osborne described the demands for a wealth tax as \"the politics of resentment\".</p> <p>Cameron said his party would \"level\" with the public about the need for another \u00a316bn of spending cuts &#xa0;in 2015-16, as he put the prospect of working age welfare cuts on the table while making clear that a mansion tax or other wealth tax would definitely not &#xa0;be part of the mix.</p> <p>\"I don't actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you save, you buy yourself a house, you try and pay down the mortgage, you save and invest into that house \u2013 I don't want to be a country that comes after you every year with a massive great tax, and so that is not going to happen, but we have put extra taxes where people buy expensive properties. Now I'm not going to announce the measures here on your programme - I know that's sad for you - but we will always be fair and seen to be fair.\"</p> <p>He vowed to stand by his pre-election promise to protect universal benefits for pensioners such as free bus passes and winter fuel payments, while identifying &#xa0;\"working age welfare\" as an area for reduction.</p> <p>\"We have to find these spending reductions and if we want to avoid cuts in things like hospitals and schools, services that we all rely on, we have to look at things like the welfare budget,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister also defended the decision to cut the \"completely uncompetitive\" top rate of tax, saying that four times as much was being raised from the richest by measures such as putting a new stamp duty on expensive houses, and tackling tax avoidance and evasion.</p> <p>He shed little light on what measures he had in mind as he outlined the &#xa0;principle of further contributions by the wealthiest. \"We will make sure that the rich pay their fair share \u2026 We are going to take further action to make sure the wealthiest people in our country pay their fair share towards deficit reduction.\"</p> <p>The decision to rule out a mansion tax was underlined by Osborne, who told Sky News that a wealth tax risked driving enterprise abroad.</p> <p>\"We're not going to have a new mansion tax, nor do I think it's sensible to have a wealth tax in the sense of a sort of tax on your wealth levied annually. Other countries have tried that and it hasn't work, and it's driven enterprise and investment abroad,\" he said.</p> <p>\"So we're not going to do those two ideas, but I'm very clear that the rich will have to make a contribution to closing the budget deficit; I'm absolutely clear that in the decisions we take in the years ahead, as well as dealing with welfare, as well as continuing to reduce government spending in departments, we are also going to have to ask the rich to make another contribution.\"</p> <p>The Tory leadership sought to wrest back the \"One Nation\" mantle as it gathered for a party conference running on the theme \"Britain can deliver\", just days after Ed Miliband used his well-received keynote conference speech to recast the party as \"One Nation Labour\" in contrast to Cameron's \"two nation party\".</p> <p>Osborne has drawn up a package of measures worth \u00a3500m&#xa0;to help middle class families: he said the government would extend the council tax freeze for a third year and cap rises in season ticket and peak rail fares at no more than 1% over the inflation rate in 2013 and 2014, lower than the formula set out in his 2010 spending review.</p> <p>The conference opened with co-chair Grant Shapps urging the party faithful to rally behind their leader. He also fired the starting gun for the Tories' 2015 general election campaign as he told activists not to be \"shy\" about boasting of their achievements in government \u2013 and announced the party would target seats held by its Liberal Democrat coalition partners.</p> <p>But eurosceptics within the party will no doubt have been disappointed to hear the prime minister appear to rule out offering voters an in-or-out referendum on Europe.</p> <p>Cameron said voters should be given the opportunity - either in a referendum or a general election \u2013 to give their \"fresh consent\" to a new settlement for Britain's position in Europe.</p> <p>Giving a tough sounding message to his party, he backed Theresa May's call for a review of the free movement of EU labour as part of a broader assessment of Britain's relationship with Europe and said&#xa0;he was ready to use Britain's veto to prevent \"massive\" increases in the EU's long-term budget from 2014.</p> <p>But on the issue of a straight in-or-out referendum, he said believed that it was in Britain's interest to remain in the EU.</p> <p>\"I think the trouble with a straight yes or no, as we stand today, is frankly I'm not happy with the status quo, so I don't want to have to say yes to the status quo, but I also don't think it would be right to leave like that, because we would basically be coming out of a single market, which our businesses badly need,\" he told Marr.</p> <p>\"I think that Ukip is a complete waste of time, obviously, but the fact is I think most people in our country don't actually want to leave the European Union or just accept how it is at the moment, they want to change it. I want to change it. A Conservative-only government after the next election can go and change it, can have that renegotiation, particularly as you see Europe opening up in all the ways that I've explained.\"</p> <p>The issue of a referendum on Europe surfaced at a fringe meeting on how to secure an outright Tory win at the next general election. Former shadow home secretary David Davis said he was not in favour of leaving the EU but wanted a renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels.</p> <p>\"I don't think promising a referendum would win us 10 votes in the next general election because people don't believe us anymore. Every single party has promised a referendum then broken its promise, for whatever reason, they each have a legitimate reason behind it,\" he told the meeting.</p> <p>\"But nobody believes us anymore so if we are going to have a referendum we must start the process now, before the election so that we actually say to people 'this is what's going to happen, this is the question, this is the tactic'.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 23 September, there were elections in Belarus. President Alexander Lukashenko's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19690249\" title=\"supporters won every seat\">supporters won every seat</a>. <a href=\"http://rt.com/news/belarusian-president-last-dictator/\" title=\"Lukashenko\">Lukashenko</a>, formerly a state farm director, has been in power since 1994, presiding over the last dictatorship in Europe.</p> <p>I was there in the early summer, to visit Chernobyl. We stayed mainly on the Ukrainian side, but had received permission to enter the \"alienated zone\" in Belarus. So much of the former Soviet Union feels depopulated and abandoned compared with the west, but near the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJlR-05o5xo\" title=\"Chernobyl zone\">Chernobyl zone</a> that feeling gradually intensifies. We drove for hours along empty roads lined with birch and pine, abandoned houses dotting the landscape. On the Ukrainian side, old men and women worked on small plots, raking hay into stacks. Some people have drifted back into the zone, but there are no young people there, and there won't be for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years&#xa0;to come: the radiation is too&#xa0;dangerous.</p> <p>Eventually we reached the border between Ukraine and Belarus. Our permission to enter the \"alienated zone\" in Belarus was rescinded, and I went to the capital, Minsk, a five-hour drive on a straight road through endless forests and past vast collective farm fields, a&#xa0;landscape so relentlessly flat, so unchanging from beginning to end, that only an autocratic centralising regime could have produced it.</p> <p>Most of Minsk was destroyed in the second world war; it is now an entirely modern city. Modern architecture in the west is so piecemeal in comparison \u2013 a mixture of individual buildings with&#xa0;no obvious relationship to each other, or uninspired housing districts for the poor. Minsk is a city that only could have emerged from total war, and in a political system of excessive state control, a vision of a dystopian future.</p> <p>That evening I met <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belarus-opposition-politician-andrei-sannikov-freed-from-jail-7646979.html\" title=\"Andrei Sannikov\">Andrei Sannikov</a> and his wife, journalist Iryna Kahlip. He was the presidential candidate who was imprisoned after the crackdown in&#xa0;December 2010, following the presidential elections. He was sentenced to five years but was released, after international pressure, 16 months later. Iryna received a suspended sentence and is still under curfew. The police come to check on them every night, sometimes several times a night.</p> <p>We met in the home of friends in an anonymous block of flats. The poky lift carried us creakily upwards. A woman looked at us curiously. We sat in the small kitchen. Andrei spoke of his imprisonment and his fading hope for democracy. He had black shadows under his eyes; Iryna, also, looked so tired. I&#xa0;was tired too. None of us could eat much of the Russian feast in front of us, though we did drink the Georgian wine. Quite soon they had to leave to be back in their own flat in time for the&#xa0;curfew.</p> <p>I went on to a rehearsal at the Belarus Free Theatre, the dissident Belarussian theatre group. Its headquarters are a&#xa0;tiny suburban house. Inside, two modest rooms have been thrown into one \u2013 the owner smashed down the internal wall with a sledgehammer to give the company more space. The actors rehearsed their piece; a dance of&#xa0;dictatorship with&#xa0;no lines, only hums and sudden, discordant screams. I talked to some of the performers afterwards. They were young, engaged and alternative \u2013 we might have been in Berlin or New York, rather than Europe's last dictatorship.</p> <p>The group's founders, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/04/belarus-free-theatre-protest-feature\" title=\"Natalia Kaliada and Nikolai Khalezin\">Natalia Kaliada and Nikolai Khalezin</a>, are political refugees in London. It was easy to forget the political reality, but later, after they showed me what was left of old Minsk \u2013 a handful of buildings survived the war \u2013 a nebulous political fear descended on me. I lay on the bed in my hotel room thinking about the epic sweep of Soviet repression, the hope after 1989, which faded with the post-Soviet political violence; beatings, abductions and murders. I thought, most of all, of Oleg Bebenin, Sannikov's press secretary and close friend, founder of the Belarussian citizens' rights group <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_97\" title=\"Charter 97\">Charter 97</a>, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/08/belarus-activist-oleg-bebenin\" title=\"found hanged at his dascha\">found hanged at his dacha</a> in 2010 with unexplained bruises on his hand, chest and back. We had talked about him earlier. I thought about how easy it is for governments to kill people. \"They threatened me too,\" Sannikov said. \"I&#xa0;had no reason not to believe them.\"</p> <p>In 1999, <a href=\"http://charter97.org/eng/news/2003/04/04/karpenka\" title=\"Gennady Karpenko\">Gennady Karpenko</a>, the leader of the opposition to Lukashenko, died, either of a cerebral haemorrhage, or of poison. Jury Zacharanka, the former minister of internal affairs who had joined the opposition, disappeared the same year. So did Victor Gonchar, opposition politician, and Anatol Krasouski, a businessman who was with him that evening. A year later, cameraman Dmitriy Zavadski disappeared. They are all presumed dead, victims of Lukashenko's regime. The owner of the flat where we met, a man in his 60s, kissed my hand as we left. He had told us earlier about being beaten not so long ago near the entrance of the block. \"Don't bother to&#xa0;call the police,\" one of his attackers said. \"We are the police.\"</p> <p><em>Sigrid Rausing is the publisher of Granta Magazine and Books, and founder and&#xa0;chair of the </em><a href=\"http://www.sigrid-rausing-trust.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Sigrid Rausing Trust</em></a><em>, a&#xa0;charitable foundation dedicated to&#xa0;human rights.</em></p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> \"We have real strength in our attacking options,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/06/sir-alex-ferguson-newcastle-united\">this week</a>. He's not lying. Only Manchester City and Chelsea have scored more than United so far this season, and they've both played a game more. Their attacking might is not in doubt, but it's their strength at the other end that is open to question. The only side that United have kept out in the Premier League this season is Wigan, who have started the campaign in pretty ordinary fashion and are among the division's lowest scorers thus far. It is, stats boffins tell me, United's worst defensive start to a season in a decade.</p> <p>Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick and a central midfield as porous as limestone have born the brunt of the blame, but the fading powers of Ferdinand and Evra in the back four can't be ignored, nor can the absence of Nemanja Vidic. Jonny Evans still gives the impression that he will eventually find a home away from Old Trafford, a la Wes Brown and John O'Shea. Newcastle certainly have the dynamism to test United here, though they share the visitors' defensive vulnerability.</p> <p>History give us further hope for a goal-filled funfest. Newcastle, of course, won 3-0 in this fixture last season and since the turn of the century we've had a 4-3, a 6-2, a 4-1 and a 5-1 in matches between these sides at St James's Park. And who could forget that wonderful 7-3 home win in 1960?</p> <p>Soooooo, all signs point to goals, goals, goals, goals, goals, goals. Which is rather marvelous news. And also means we're most likely in for a dour 0-0, damn law of the sod and all.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong><br>Team news:</strong><br><strong>Newcastle United</strong> (4-4-2): Harper; Santon, Williamson, Perch, Ferguson; Ben Arfa, Tiot\u00e9, Cabaye, Guti\u00e9rrez; Ba, Ciss\u00e9<br>Subs: Alnwick, Simpson, Anita, Bigirimana, Obertan, Sammy Ameobi, Shola Ameobi<br><strong>Manchester United: </strong>(um, 4-2-something-diddly-bong-whoops): De Gea; Rafael, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra; Carrick, Cleverley; Kagawa, Rooney, van Persie, Welbeck. Subs: Lindegaard, Scholes, Valencia, Anderson, Giggs, Hernandez, Wootton.</p> <p>So United opt for De Gea rather than Lindegaard in goal. And quite how their front four will fit together is anyone's guess. Welbeck wide right, perhaps? For the home side, Coloccini has failed to recover from a hamstring problem so James Perch comes into the centre of defence. The 21-year-old Shane Ferguson makes a fourth league start at left-back.</p> <!-- Block 3 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397318624\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345548029905/Goats-rest-on-a-vintage-t-002.jpg\" alt=\"Goats rest on a vintage truck at Caribou Crossing in Yukon\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goats rest on a vintage truck at Caribou Crossing in Yukon Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tactics truck:</strong> \"Looks like Fergie is opting for the 4-2-1-3 that was used in the first match against Everton,\" writes Paul Bergin. \"Since he's given up on protecting his defense you can take it that there will be goals today, though if Tiot\u00e9 takes out Kagawa then the front three are going to struggle to get much of the ball.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Sutton and Shearer, Bright and Wright, Deane and Agana \u2026</strong> British football has seen some great strike duos over the years.

Corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>GOAL!!! Newcastle 0-1 Manchester United (Evans 8)</strong> \u2026 powered home by Evans! The United centre-half lost Williamson, soared highest in the box and powered a fantastic, thumping header past Harper in the Newcastle goal.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Newcastle really haven't had their Weetabix here. Ben Arfa tries to gets something going with a fleet-footed dance down the right.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Manchester United are a whisker away from a second goal. Van Persie flicks the ball down the right to send Rafael scurrying away like a mad ferret. His fizzing early drive zips just wide of Harper's post.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Holy moly, Steve Harper has nearly gifted United their second. In a presentation box, complete with ribbons, bow and gift receipt should they want to return it. He dallies over a backpass, allows Welbeck to close him down but holds on to the ball desperately. Welbeck eventually nips it off him, but his shot \u2013&#xa0;from an angle \u2013 is dragged wide with the goal gaping. A little inside pass to Van Persie would've given the Dutchman a tap-in.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> \"Danny Welbeck is the new Paulo Wanchope,\" reckons Mark Judd, somehow managing to be harsh on both players. United have a dangerous free-kick here after Tiote trips Cleverly. Rooney strikes it, but Harper gets across to tip wide. Corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL!!! Newcastle United 0-2 Manchester United (Evra 15)</strong> Another corner, another goal. And this time it's little Patrice Evra with the header! It's more slack marking from Newcastle as the left-back zips across the box and gets to the near-post corner first, glancing home powerfully past Harper.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Newcastle finally get into the Manchester United box. The ball drops loose to Gutierrez, whose drilled effort flies narrowly wide.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Louise Gill writes to point out an \"outrageous\" Tiote challenge on Cleverley in the opening minutes. Indeed, he was a a touch fortunate to escape with nothing more than a ticking off.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> This has been the best start seen in Newcastle since Raiders of the Lost Ark was on at the Tyneside Cinema. Still, the home side are beginning to rub the sleep from their eyes and, while they're perhaps not fully awake, at least they're heading in the direction of the kettle in their dressing gown. De Gea watches a cross go far too deep.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Santon gets a yard of space. Cleverly blocks the cross. And Newcastle have a corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> \u2026 dragged back to Ba, but thumped wildly wide by the in-form striker.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Jonny Evans is getting some magic-sponge treatment in the area after that corner. Pardew takes the opportunity to have an impromptu team meeting on the touchline. I imagine it's not along the lines of: \"Well, chaps, this isn't quite going to plan, eh? Never mind, pip pip and chins up \u2026\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Van Persie goes into Gutierrez. It's a nothing challenge, but Jonas is up and in the Manchester United man's grille.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Ferdinand goes into Howard Webb's Little Book of Very Naughty Boys after sliding into Ba from behind on the halfway line.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Another Van Persie foul (this time on Santon) sees him join Ferdinand in the book. Tiote is this time the man with a few choice words for the Dutchman.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Newcastle have clawed their way back into this since Ben Arfa switched to the left following Manchester United's second goal. De Gea flaps a a cross like a broken swingball but Newcastle can't take advantage.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Tiote bundles Rooney over, hears Webb's whistle then drops to his knees screaming like an 80s Bruce Springsteen hitting the top notes in Born To Run. Webb, unimpressed, flashes the yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Rafael and Kagawa combine neatly down the right. Shane Ferguson is struggled to cope when that pair conspire.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Welbeck gets in behind the Newcastle back four, but he's got less support than Dagenham and Redbridge (sorry, Daggers fans). His cross rolls a lonely path across the six-yard box.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> \"Mohawk, check, overly agressive, check, feeling hard done by after roughing up overhyped opponent, check,\" writes David Flynn. \"Good to see Tiote's Clubber Lang impersonation is coming along nicely.\" My prediction?

Again he aims a rather panicked punch at a loose high ball, but he gets just about enough contact on it for his defenders to complete the clearance.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Guttierez goes steaming into Kagawa, and arrives later than the 14.05 East Midlands Trains service from Wellingborough to Nottingham. Webb produces the fifth yellow card of the half.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Another Manchester United corner is dealt with unconvincingly by the Newcastle defence with (I think) Carrick's flick-on <em>just</em> evading the unmarked Rooney at the back post.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Newcastle, as my dad would say (often while popping in a 'lucky' mint), could do with nicking one before half-time. Ciss\u00e9, having broken free from Evra's shirt-grab, nods wide from a curling free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>45+2 min:</strong> Welbeck steadily makes ground down the right. A loose touch allows Newcastle to get a tackle in, but it's another corner ...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>45+3 min:</strong> \u2026 and after a bit of a scramble, the details of which I won't bore you with, Rooney hits the side-netting with an attempted cross.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>PEEP!

Manchester United get the second half off and running.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Both keepers get an early touch, both from nicely judged back-headers.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Ferguson cuts inside and makes a strong surge in the direction of the box. Rafael defends brilliantly, going stride-for-stride then nicking the ball away with a challenge so clean you could eat your dinner of it.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Manchester United have begun with a certain amount of renewed authority here. Newcastle can't afford the sort of dozy start they made in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> <strong>HOW DID THAT STAY OUT?</strong> No, really, <strong>HOW DID THAT STAY OUT?</strong> And, when it comes to it, <strong>DID IT</strong> stay out? De Gea goes from zero to hero. Another broken-swingball-flap, allows Ba to nod against the bar. As it drops, Ciss\u00e9 heads goalwards. De Gea claws it back brilliantly \u2026 but is it over the line? Three-quarters of the ball were over at least. The linesman remains unmoved and we've not seen enough replays to be certain. I think that was probably in. The Man Utd fan sitting on my left reckons otherwise \u2026</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> [INSERT GOAL-LINE TECHNOLOGY REFERENCE]</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Cabaye flicks a cross in, Ba gets ahead of Ferdinand but his header drifts wide. Ferguson responds by swapping Kagawa for Antonio Valencia.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> If, and it's a big if, Newcastle can get one back here then an equaliser would be no surprise. Two-nil is a dangerous score, as Neil Warnock once (slightly madly) said.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> \"Can somebody answer what the hell is so difficult about a goalkeeper dealing with a cross or high ball?\" rages David Flynn. \"Does David Dea Gea have some sort of inner ear trouble and so gets completely disorientated when he puts his arms above his head? Does he have no muscles in his ankles and so can't jump straight up? What is the problem here?\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> As the TV cameras focus on the home technical area, Rooney capitalises on a Tiote mistake, breaks free and looses a shot on the Newcastle goal. Harper saves well and the loose ball is tidied up before Van Persie can react.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Ben Arfa drifts into the centre of the pitch and finds acres of space between the lines of defence and midfield. His shot from distance is dragged well wide, however.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Here come Foluwashola Ameobi and Vurnon Anita in place of Ferguson and Cisse.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> <strong>GO \u2026</strong> Oh, hang on, offside. Rooney dinks a pass to Van Persie, Van Persie dinks a shot over Harper, but the the linesman has dinked his flag into the air.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Cabaye sends in a cross so tasty it comes with a side order of hand-cut, triple-fried chips. Ameobi glances a header at goal but it drifts wide via a deflection. And the resultant corner comes to four-fifths of nothing.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Pass, pass, pass from the visitors \u2026</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Newcastle Utd 0-3 Manchester Utd (Cleverley 70)</strong> If he means this, it's a screamer. From 25 yards out on the corner of the box, Cleverley either overhits a inswinging cross to Van Persie or pings a glorious effort into the top corner of Harper's net, depending on your point of view. I'd tend towards the former, but then I'm a miserable so-and-so.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> The atmosphere at St James's has been rocking for much of the second half, but that goal has unsurprisingly taken the wind from the Newcastle sails.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Van Persie is poleaxed by Perch. Howard Webb produces yellow card No6.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Newcastle get dangerously sloppy at the back, but Manchester United can't cut through on this occasion.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Santon lashes a shot at goal. Deflected. Corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> \u2026 scramble, scramble, scramble. Then De Gea does well to punch away as Perch puts him under pressure.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Paul Scholes replaces Wayne Rooney. Newcastle swap Tiote with Bigirimana.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Looking at a few still images of that Newcastle 'goal', it's still very, very difficult to make a definitive call either way. That being the case, you'd have to say the officials made the right decision.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Mahela Jayawardene has described this World T20 final as \"the biggest cricket match ever in this country.\" That's some billing for the short form of the game which some purists still believe clashes with the fundamental principles of cricket. Wherever you sit on that debate, there can be no questioning the entertainment on offer in Sri Lanka over the past few weeks. This is a final between two sides that ooze quality at the top and bottom of the order. West Indies were comprehensively beaten by Sri Lanka in the Super Eights. Nine wickets was the margin of that loss, but with Chris Gayle and co earning a final spot with victory over Australia, it's clean slate and a shot at glory in Colombo.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Darren Sammy has won the toss and West Indies will bat first.</strong></p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> DPMD Jayawardene*, TM Dilshan, KC Sangakkara\u2020, AD Mathews, BMAJ Mendis, HDRL Thirimanne, NLTC Perera, KMDN Kulasekara, SL Malinga, A Dananjaya, BAW Mendis</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>West Indies:</strong> J Charles, CH Gayle, MN Samuels, DJ Bravo, KA Pollard, AD Russell, D Ramdin\u2020, DJG Sammy*, SP Narine, R Rampaul, S Badree</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>The Windies have fielded an unchanged side, while Sri Lanka make one change.

No need to tell you that this is a sell out. There were queues at the ground at midnight last night!</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>The teams are out for the national anthems...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>Let's get going... Chris Gayle and Johnson Charles to open the batting for the Windies. Angelo Mathews has the ball in hand...</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>0.4 overs: West Indies 0-0 (Charles 0, Gayle 0)</strong> Mathews swings one away from Charles first up, the opening batsman shouldering arms before defending into the covers from the next two deliveries. No score so far. The pressure is already growing on Charles with four successive dot balls, all played into the off side.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 0-1 (Charles c Kulasekara b Mathews 0)</strong></p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>What a great start for Sri Lanka! Four dot balls and Charles attempts to pull short ball, skewing it straight up in the air where Kulasekara is waiting to claim a dolly at mid-off!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1st over: West Indies 0-1 (Gayle 0, Samuels 0)</strong> A wicket maiden to start with from Mathews. What a start for Sri Lanka.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>2nd over: West Indies 1-1 (Gayle 0, Samuels 0)</strong> Nuwan Kulasekara, who dispatched Chris Gayle last time out, is brought into the Sri Lanka attack. He starts with three dots and the Windies haven't scored from nine balls, they need to get things going and fast. Gayle doesn't look perturbed, however, as Kulasekara sends a wide narrowly down the leg side. That's the first run on the scorecard, and Gayle then charges down the track but is beaten by a delightful away-swinger. Excellent ball from Kulasekara and it's a wry smile from Gayle. No batsman has troubled the scorers after two overs!</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3rd over: West Indies 2-1 (Gayle 0, Samuels 1)</strong> Mathews into Samuels, who leaves his first ball. Another dot from the second, which is bang on line and length. And another from the third! My goodness this is fine bowling from Sri Lanka, as the appeals go up for lbw ... not out, although replays show the ball would just have clipped leg stump. Very difficult one to give, though. Samuels flicks one off his legs and West Indies finally get a run off the bat. Mathews beats Gayle on the final delivery, another fantastic over.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>4th over: West Indies 8-1 (Gayle 1, Samuels 6)</strong> The first boundary of the game! Kulasekara back into the attack and there is just enough width for Samuels to thrash one through the covers for four. That will relieve a bit of pressure, but still the Windies are under the cosh here. Samuels plays a single down to long-off to put Gayle back on strike. Here comes Kulasekara again and he swings one back into the pads of Gayle, but that was just sliding down the leg side. Six from the over and although that's the most expensive offering yet, Sri Lanka are in total control.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>5th over: West Indies 12-1 (Gayle 3, Samuels 8)</strong> Lasith Malinga is thrown into the mix by Jayawardene. Gayle clips one delicately off his legs for a single. Another one for Samuels, turning it away on the leg side. Fantastic delivery from Malinga! He gets one to cut away from Gayle, who pulls his hand away at the last moment, but that beat the big man all ends up. Gayle is looking a wee bit hesitant out there, which is quite unlike him. Remember things can turn so quickly in T20, though. The batsmen appear happy to take the singles at the moment, and Gayle allows the final ball to fly through to Sangakkara.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>5.3 overs: West Indies 14-1 (Gayle 3, Samuels 9)</strong> Ajantha Mendis changes the pace for Sri Lanka now, and Samuels opens the face and edges one for a single. Only four balls left in the batting powerplay, let's see what Gayle can do now. Mendis sends a wide down the leg side before drifting it into Gayle's front pad. Sri Lanka appeal but not out says umpire Taufel.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 14-2 (Gayle lbw b A Mendis 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>Gayle force goes! Oh this is a quite brilliant display of bowling from Sri Lanka, Mendis beating him all ends up and that was absolutely plumb!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>6th over: West Indies 14-2 (Samuels 9, Bravo 0)</strong> Mendis finishes the over with a quicker delivery that darts away from Dwayne Bravo. Wonderful stuff from him</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>7th over: West Indies 18-2 (Samuels 11, Bravo 1)</strong> Out of the powerplay now and the fielders drop back to the boundary. Angelo Mathews comes into the attack once again, and West Indies add a couple of runs to the tally with comfortable singles. We've only had one boundary so far in this innings, and one feels Samuels is the man who needs to pick things up. Malinga with some top fielding out in the deep, scuttling across to prevent the two. The run-rate is 2.57!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>8th over: West Indies 22-2 (Samuels 14, Bravo 2)</strong> Ajantha Mendis to continue for Sri Lanka, and the batsmen have no idea what kind of delivery is coming next. There is a little bit of slow turn out in the middle, but nothing spectacular by any stretch of the imagination. This is just wonderful bowling. Samuels goes for the big shot but misses the ball and he doesn't trouble the scorers. He does add three runs off the final two deliveries, but Sri Lanka won't mind about that.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>9th over: West Indies 29-2 (Samuels 19, Bravo 3)</strong> Mathews steaming in once more. One shoots down the leg side with Bravo on strike. Good fielding by Dananjaya down at third man, firing a throw in to prevent the two. More excellent fielding from Sri Lanka, this time it's Malinga, so often maligned for his work in the deep, who sprints across with an athletic dive to stop the four. Samuels is finding the middle now but is denied another boundary, this time from Kulasekara at wide long-off. So frustrating for the Windies.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>10th over: West Indies 32-2 (Samuels 20, Bravo 5)</strong> Dananjaya is brought into the attack and at 19 this lad's heart must be beating. West Indies will surely go after him, but Samuels and Bravo seem content in knocking singles. Samuels then goes for an almighty thwack but he misses the ball completely, the little white orb nutmeging the batsman. Just three singles off the over, more remarkable bowling.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>11th over: West Indies 38-2 (Samuels 23, Bravo 8)</strong> Jeevan Mendis in now and it's a dropped catch from Kulasekara at long-off! Samuels is going after everything and Mendis nearly benefited with a wicket, but Kulasekara couldn't quite hold onto it after seemingly taking the ball with a wonderful effort. Only six runs from the over as Samuels drives the final delivery to Jayawardene in the covers. The pressure is cranking up.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>12th over: West Indies 48-2 (Samuels 26, Bravo 15)</strong> Finally we get a big hit! Bravo smacks Dananjaya over cow corner for an almighty maximum. That doesn't perturb the young bowler, though, who persists with his marvelous variation. 10 runs from the over, with Bravo adding to the tally with a few singles. The run-rate is 4.00, still West Indies in deep, deep trouble.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>13th over: West Indies 69-2 (Samuels 45, Bravo 17)</strong> Lasith Malinga back into the Sri Lanka attack and he swings a yorker right in the blockhole, which Bravo does well to dig out. Samuels on strike now and there he goes ... another six for the West Indies! A full ball is dispatched over mid-wicket and well over the boundary. Samuels is starting to turn it on now and another full delivery from Malinga is bashed away, this time over the off-side fielders for another six! And Samuels finishes with another maximum, over wide long-on this time! Well, it's nice of you to join us West Indies.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>13.5 overs: West Indies 67-3 (Samuels 47, Bravo 19)</strong> Malinga took an absolute battering in that over, but Ajantha Mendis has slowed things down once again. The batsmen are still finding it difficult to read the Sri Lanka spinners.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 73-3 (Bravo lbw b A Mendis 19)</strong></p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>That's a poor decision from Simon Taufel. Bravo got a clear inside edge as the ball diverted into his pads, and he looks exasperated as he walks back to the dugout.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>15th over: West Indies 87-3 (Samuels 59, Pollard 2)</strong> Kieron Pollard comes to the crease with Jeevan Mendis continuing in the attack. Samuel trots down the track and that's an almighty six over long-on. He didn't even catch that in the middle but it still flew over the rope. A four next up from Samuels, a miscued shot through mid-wicket that raced to the boundary. 14 runs from that over and West Indies are making a fight of this. Samuels is playing quite magnificently.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 87-4 (Pollard c Dananjaya b A Mendis 2)</strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>Claimed by Dananjaya at the second attempt! Pollard cut away and there was the 19-year-old at short third man to palm up into the air and then clutch the ball gratefully to his chest!</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 87-5 (Russell lbw b A Mendis 0)</strong></p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>It's a golden duck for Russell and two in two for Mendis, the batsman attempting a slog sweep and completely missing it. Hat-trick opportunity...</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>16th over: West Indies 89-5 (Samuels 60, Sammy 1)</strong> The hat-trick ball is a poor effort from Mendis, I suppose we can forgive him for that. Run-out chance off the final ball as Sammy is slow making his ground, but replays show the Windies captain just got his bat over the white line.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>17th over: West Indies 108-5 (Samuels 78, Sammy 2)</strong> Replays suggesting that Pollard may have gloved the ball before it hit his pad for that lbw decision. That's been and gone, and Malinga is back into the Sri Lanka attack now. Remember he was treated with absolute disregard by Samuels earlier in the innings, but the first ball is much better, right in the blockhole. Samuels swats him past backward point for four with the third ball, though, before dispatching a short ball over fine leg for six! I don't know what Malinga was thinking there, that was a woeful delivery. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Malinga, who has had such a fine tournament, is pummeled to the long-on boundary for another six! And when I say to the boundary, I mean to the top tier of the stands! Samuels nearly hit that out of the ground, a staggering shot.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 108-6 (Samuels c J Mendis b Dananjaya 78)</strong></p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>That's the key wicket! The 19-year-old Dananjaya is brought back into the attack and Samuels pulls him through mid-wicket, but there is Jeevan Mendis with a simple catch on the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>18th over: West Indies 112-6 (Sammy 3, Ramdin 2)</strong> That was an inspired bowling change from Jayawardene, as Ramdin emerges for the last few overs. A few half-hearted lbw appeals from Dananjaya to finish an excellent over with the pressure really on.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>19th over: West Indies 122-6 (Sammy 11, Ramdin 4)</strong> Malinga to continue after that dreadful previous effort, but with Samuels now sat back in the dugout, maybe he can breath easy. Two excellent yorkers to start with, but the second is somehow dug out by Sammy, who edges it down to fine leg for four. The skipper then goes for a big strike through the off side, he sends it up in the air, but it lands safely. Another top yorker from Malinga's final ball, but West Indies take a single.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>20th over: West Indies 137-6 (Sammy 26, Ramdin 4)</strong> The batsmen take a quick two from the first ball of the final over, which will be delivered by Kulasekara. West Indies know this over is absolutely crucial, they can post a respectable score with some big boundaries here. Sammy duly obliges, smashing it through mid-wicket, one bounce and that flies over the rope. Kulasekara is keeping it pretty tight as another full ball is dispatched to wide long-on, Sammy taking two once again. The captain is leading from the front and smacks the ball down to mid-off, running back for two, but only one is recorded after Sammy failed to ground his bat over the line. Final ball of the innings ... and it's hit down the ground for four! A good way to end things and West Indies have salvaged a car crash of an innings.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Sri Lanka need 138 runs to win</strong></p> <!-- Block 47 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397318580\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: email\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>\"The Windies will need at least 140 to have a chance I reckon,\"</em> writes <strong>Simon McMahon</strong>.</p> <p>Well they did extremely well to reach 137, they at least can make a game of this after a dreadful start.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>Credit to Marlon Samuels for his wonderful knock of 78. Without him, West Indies were looking at a sub-100 score.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>The teams are out for the second innings...</strong></p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>The spinner Badree will open the bowling for the Windies, with Jayawardene and Dilshan at the crease.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>1st over: Sri Lanka 6-0 (Jayawardene 6, Dilshan 0)</strong> Well, the Windies need a good start, that's for sure. Badree kicks things off with some sliding, low deliveries. However, the Sri Lanka captain tickles one well down to the third man boundary off the fourth ball of the over. Lovely shot from Jayawardene, a solid start for his side.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 6-1 (Dilshan b Rampaul 0)</strong></p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p>Rampaul with an absolute jaffa! A fantastic first ball that sends Dilshan's off peg tumbling, sublime stuff and he goes for a duck!</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Sri Lanka 11-1 (Jayawardene 5, Sangakkara 5)</strong> Streaky boundary from Sangakkara facing his second ball. That would have been edged straight into the hands of second slip, but instead, it races down to the boundary. Rampaul is charging in with real fire in his belly and this was exactly the start that the West Indies required. A wicket and five runs from the over.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Sri Lanka 15-1 (Jayawardene 8, Sangakkara 6)</strong> Marlon Samuels is brought into the attack and slides one into Jayawardene's pads, up into the air and caught behind ... but not out after some half-hearted appeals. Jayawardene remains on strike and sweeps one high out to the square leg boundary, Bravo is chasing over and has made it in time, but he can't quite keep hold of the white ball! Oh Bravo, you don't want to drop this man. It would have been an excellent catch, but having got to it, he might be disappointed with that.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 24-1 (Jayawardene 16, Sangakkara 6)</strong> A short and wide long-hop from Badree is cut easily to the boundary by Jayawardene. Fine shot and the Sri Lanka captain then shovels one through mid-wicket for a couple. Badree is struggling and sends down a full toss, clipped off his legs by Jayawardene for a couple.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5th over: Sri Lanka 26-1 (Jayawardene 17, Sangakkara 8)</strong> Samuels has taken a lot of the pace out of his bowling, really looping them down to Jayawardene and Sangakkara. Just three from that over, singles added to the Sri Lanka tally. West Indies need to remove these two pretty swiftly if they are going to stand a chance of winning this tie.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>6th over: Sri Lanka 30-1 (Jayawardene 19, Sangakkara 10)</strong> Ravi Rampaul brought back into the attack, it was actually a bit of a strange decision to give him a quick rest. Good pace from Rampaul, who bangs a short one down that beats Sangakkara all ends up. Another excellent, tight over for the West Indies, if they can get a wicket on the board then the pressure will start to grow on Sri Lanka.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>7th over: Sri Lanka 36-1 (Jayawardene 21, Sangakkara 14)</strong> Chris Gayle didn't do any damage with the willow in hand earlier, but now let's see what he can do with the ball in his grasp. He starts with a good line and flights one into Sangakkara, who drives well through the covers and Sri Lanka take a couple. Six from that over from Gayle, again it's pretty tight from the Windies, but they need wickets.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>8th over: Sri Lanka 39-1 (Jayawardene 22, Sangakkara 16)</strong> Narine gets two off breaks to dart viciously away from Sangakkara. Excellent bowling and Sangakkara edges one to scamper across for a single. He will be pleased to get off strike but he's immediately back into the action as Jayawardene plays a forward defensive that results in another single. That's better from the batsman, pushing one into the leg side but what a good over from Narine. Just three from it.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>9th over: Sri Lanka 46-1 (Jayawardene 24, Sangakkara 22)</strong> This is good pressure from West Indies but just as I say that, a sweet shot from Sangakkara sees him dispatch Chris Gayle over the covers and across the boundary rope. This is pretty full stuff from Gayle and a full toss is pulled away for a single by Sangakkara. Eight from the over and Sri Lanka need 91 from 66 deliveries to win this.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 48-2 (Sangakkara c Pollard b Badree 22)</strong></p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p>Excellent catch from Pollard out at deep mid-wicket! Diving forward that was a difficult take for the big man! Badree breaks the deadlock with Angelo Mathews next up.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>10th over: Sri Lanka 51-2 (Jayawardene 27, Mathews 1)</strong> 50 on the board for Sri Lanka but their fans are certainly worried. The noise inside the stadium has dropped notably. Just four runs from that over.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 51-3 (Mathews b Sammy 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p>This is quickly turning into a nightmare for Sri Lanka! Mathews tries to scoop Sammy down to fine leg but the ball crashes into his stumps and, instead, he departs for 1!</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>11th over: Sri Lanka 53-3 (Jayawardene 27, J Mendis 2)</strong> Excellent over from the captain Sammy! Just two runs from it and a wicket to boot. There is a bit of drizzle beginning to fall in Colombo, this could certainly make a difference on this game. Will Duckworth-Lewis come into play?</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>12th over: Sri Lanka 60-3 (Jayawardene 33, J Mendis 3)</strong> A drop from Russell charging forward from long-on, Jayawardene lofting it down the field and that's a let off for the captain! Badree is dispatched through the on side by Jayawardene, that's a fine drive on the up but matched by some wonderful fielding on the wide long-off boundary from Bravo, saving the four with a fantastic dive! The current run-rate is 9.75, and the required rate for Sri Lanka is 5.0.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 60-4 (Jayawardene c Sammy b Narine 33)</strong></p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p>Oh dear. Sri Lanka are sinking without a trace as Jayawardene attempts the reverse sweep, only to miscue straight to Sammy on the off side, who takes an easy catch with glee.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 61-5 (J Mendis run out Bravo 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p>Bravo at long-off fumbles but with Sri Lanka opting to come back for two, he wangs the ball back into Narine at the bowler's end, and he whips off the bails with time to spare, Mendis well out of his ground! Terrible running!</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>13th over: Sri Lanka 64-5 (Perera 3, Thirimanne 1)</strong> Narine with an excellent over. Two wickets from it, with Thisara Perera and Lahiru Thirimanne at the crease now.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 64-6 (Perera run out Ramdin 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p>This will be tough to watch if you are a Sri Lanka fan. Another suicidal run but this time we have to give real credit to the wicket-keeper Ramdin, who rushes out from behind the stump before throwing to the bowler's end with a direct hit!</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>14th over: Sri Lanka 68-6 (Thirimanne 4, Kulasekara 1)</strong> Marlon Samuels keeps things tight for the remainder of the over, four runs from it and the run-rate at the moment is 4.86. West Indies are coasting to victory, and after that wonderful start from Sri Lanka in the field earlier, what a remarkable turnaround!</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 69-7 (Thirimanne c Charles b Sammy 4)</strong></p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p>Thirimanne goes for the big six over mid-wicket but doesn't catch it right at all and it is gobbled up by Charles at wide long-on. This is a major collapse now.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>15th over: Sri Lanka 72-7 (Kulasekara 4, Malinga 1)</strong> Darren Sammy is dancing and jigging out there, and you can understand why. An excellent over and Sri Lanka need 66 runs from 30 balls.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>16th over: Sri Lanka 94-7 (Kulasekara 24, Malinga 2)</strong> Ravi Rampaul is brought back into the attack, he's had two overs so far and what a ball it was earlier to send Dilshan packing. Malinga is lucky to get some bat on a short delivery, pushing it down to third man for a single. Some hope for the hosts and suddenly the fans find their voice again, Kulasekara thumps a six well over the rope through mid-wicket. Kulasekara pulls a four for another boundary and Rampaul looks frustrated down there. Two fine shots have suddenly provided Sri Lanka with a much-needed shot in the arm. Oh dear! Rampaul with a filthy wide ball on length that is cut away for four more! That was a no ball as well, so a free hit, and some stupid fielding from Samuels down at third man \u2013 he dives forward attempting the catch, missing the ball which bounces over the line for four! It wouldn't have been a wicket if he had caught it anyway! Oh Marlon! Will we have a grandstand finish here?</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 96-8 (Kulasekara c Badree b Narine 26)</strong></p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p>Kulasekara pays the price for his big hitting and it's Narine who picks up the crucial wicket, out on the off-side boundary. An easy catch for Badree, although he nearly let it slip!</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>17th over: Sri Lanka 97-8 (Malinga 2, A Mendis 0)</strong> Ajantha Mendis joins Malinga at the crease. Three from Narine's over and these tail-enders need to produce something really special.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 100-9 (A Mendis c Bravo b Samuels 1)</strong></p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p>The dancing begins in earnest for the Windies! Marlon Samuels is being dusted down after claiming that wicket, Mendis attempting the slog over cow corner, but sending it sky high and straight down the throat of Bravo at long-on.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>18th over: Sri Lanka 101-9 (Malinga 5, Dananjaya 0)</strong> Sri Lanka need 37 to win off 12 balls. It will be a miracle if they achieve it, as the youngster Dananjaya partners Malinga in the middle.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 101 all out (Malinga c Bravo b Narine 5)</strong></p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>WEST INDIES ARE CHAMPIONS! THEY WIN BY 36 RUNS!</strong></p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p>Well you have to feel for Sri Lanka. They started this game so well but Marlon Samuels dragged the Windies back into the game and the bowlers continued his good work.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p>They are dancing with joy out on the pitch and these celebrations will continue long into the night!</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p>Sky ran a poll during that game asking if West Indies relied too heavily on Chris Gayle. Well, I think they proved that was not the case today. Gayle was not the imperious force with the bat that he has been throughout the tournament, but my how Marlon Samuels was! What a knock from him!</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p>To be honest, I'm quite astonished by that result. Let's not forget that after 11 overs West Indies were 38-2.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p>Thanks for joining me for today's conclusion to the World T20. It has been a great tournament, with surprises all the way. The Windies become the fourth side to lift the trophy, with Sri Lanka denied glory in front of their own fans.</p>",
  "<p>'What is that man for?\" a little girl asked, pointing at the egregious figure of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_Churchill\" title=\"\">Randolph Churchill</a>. Even that ever-diminishing band who could be called friends of Randolph, Sir Winston's bibulous and noisy son, sometimes pondered the same question. And today it could be asked of the party with which the Churchills once had such complicated relations: what is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\" title=\"\">Conservative party</a> for?</p> <p>All our parties have been going through existential crises, and for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrats</a> theirs may yet be terminal. But Labour has turned its fortunes round in a way that would have seemed most unlikely during Gordon Brown's disastrous tenure and the humiliating collapse in the Labour vote at the last election. That recovery leaves the Tories in a fix, and they reach their conference in despondent mood.</p> <p>Although Cameron has been endlessly derided for his failure to win a majority of seats two and a half year ago, this derision can only come from those unable to read simple electoral statistics. The question is not how a party with 36% of the popular vote falls short of a parliamentary majority, as happened to the Tories in 2010, but how on earth a party with barely 35% of the vote can gain a parliamentary majority, which is how Labour \"won\" in 2005.</p> <p>A ham-handed attempt to reduce the number of MPs has now been abandoned thanks to the rupture with the Lib Dems over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lordreform\" title=\"\">Lords reform</a>. Still, if Ed Miliband delights in the way that general elections remain a huge gerrymander in favour of Labour, a detached observer is perplexed by the sight of the \"progressive\" party flourishing thanks to rotten boroughs within a corrupt system, the very thing radicals spent generations campaigning against.</p> <p>But there it is, and the Tories find the odds heavily stacked against them. This is paradoxically compounded by the general rightward change in the political weather, whatever Labour cheerleaders may say. Tony Blair moved steadily to the right throughout his 10-year premiership, stealing Tory language and policies on health, education and crime. And whose inheritance did Miliband claim in his much admired speech last Tuesday, some great revolutionist of the past or Labour hero? No, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech\" title=\"\">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, and the old charlatan's emptily demagogic phrase about \"one nation\"!</p> <p>However cynical that larceny might seem, it leaves the Tories bereft of purpose, and identity. I'm reminded of what Hubert Butler, the Irish essayist, said about the Protestant ascendancy, the caste from which he came. After the Free State was established 90 years ago, the old ascendancy lost its traditional arrogance, but also its self-confidence and lack of self-consciousness. Something similar is true of the Tories \u2013 despite Andrew Mitchell, and with even the Daily Telegraph complaining that Cameron is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9584246/Now-its-David-Camerons-turn-to-display-his-one-nation-credentials.html\" title=\"\">\"the leader of a horrible public school clique\"</a>.</p> <p>If anything, what's wrong with the Tories of Cameron's vintage is not that they are too patrician but that they aren't patrician enough. They have not only lost their self-confidence, they have quite forgotten the redeeming virtues of the old aristocracy, from a sense of public duty to disdain for vulgar money-grubbing and realistic patriotism. Apart from anything else about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which most of us now recognise as cruel and lamentable failures, a policy of unthinking support for America's calamitous adventures throughout the Muslim world was plainly contrary to the British national interest. Why don't the Tories say so?</p> <p>The real charge against Cameron isn't Eton or Bullingdon but Carlton. Where someone of his background might once have spent his early manhood serving with the Coldstream, he spent his as a shifty PR man for a second-rate television company. And the Tories became infatuated with easy money, as can be seen by the sordid ways they have tried to raise their own party funds.</p> <p>Nor have the Tories apparently grasped the link between that easy money and our larger economic woes. It's true that the coalition inherited the consequences of Brown's burst bubble and the wreckage of public finances it left behind, but the government cannot go on using that as an excuse for ever. Anyway, whatever merits the austerity programme might have had in theory, in practice it isn't working. Do Cameron and George Osborne really understand the nature of the problem? It has been brilliantly described by James Saft, the Reuters columnist who appears in the International Herald Tribune. A large part of the reason why growth remains so low and unemployment too high is the sheer hoarding of cash by British as well as American companies. In 2011 British companies had an astonishing -- and outrageous -- cash-flow surplus of 6 pc of GDP, with historically high profit margins. This money should have been used for productive investment, but wasn't.</p> <p>In his recent book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/the-new-few-ferdinand-mount-review\" title=\"\">The New Few</a>, Ferdinand Mount, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, expresses the revulsion so many of us feel at the way that the very rich have became so much richer over the past two decades. What Saft shows is that these new few have actually enriched themselves \"by deferring long-term good\", hugely increasing their own \"compensation\" to the detriment of employees, investors, and the nation as a whole.</p> <p>Here is where Cameron could find new meaning for his party, and show what the Tories are once again for. If it once seemed cleverly counterintuitive for New Labour to proclaim it was totally relaxed about people becoming filthy rich, it would be still cleverer \u2013 and better \u2013 for Cameron to say that he was fed up with the filthy rich behaving like parasites. And Osborne could tell us that he intends to follow the precept of Winston Churchill as chancellor: \"To make industry more happy and finance less proud.\" Yes, they could do that. But don't hold your breath.</p>",
  "<p>Steven Caulker knew nothing about his first goal in top-flight football and his smile betrayed a degree of embarrassment. They all count. The Tottenham Hotspur defender found that all his stars were in alignment when Jermain Defoe took a touch to control a Gareth Bale corner and struck for goal. The shot was travelling wide only for it to deflect off the unwitting Caulker, fizz inside the near corner and send Tottenham to their fourth Premier League win in succession.</p> <p>Caulker, who is often referred to as the future of Tottenham, had previously scored only two goals, both of which came during a loan spell at Bristol City. His joy, however, led to frustration for Aston Villa, their manager, Paul Lambert, and in particular the striker Christian Benteke. Everyone in claret and blue was left to consider the tightness of the margins and how different stories can so easily be written.</p> <p>Lambert had omitted Darren Bent, again, from his starting line-up, which was coloured by controversy after the striker had come off the substitutes' bench to score the equaliser in last weekend's derby against West Bromwich Albion.</p> <p>The spotlight picked out Benteke, who started as the lone forward in a new-look formation but, after he missed a presentable shooting opportunity immediately after the interval from Gabriel Agbonlahor's cut-back, he spurned a gilt-edged header in the 51st minute that Bent, the former Tottenham player, would surely have fancied himself to score. To dredge a ghost from Bent's past, Harry Redknapp's missus would have buried it.</p> <p>The intrigue ran deeper. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, the Tottenham manager, had started with Hugo Lloris, his \u00a313m summer signing from Lyon, at the expense of Brad Friedel, who saw his sequence of 310 consecutive Premier League matches broken. It was the France goalkeeper's loose throw straight to Brett Holman that led to Marc Albrighton measuring the cross for the unmarked Benteke. When he directed the header beyond the far post Lambert contorted in agony.</p> <p>Had Benteke scored, he might have been the hero, Bent a footnote and Lloris the villain. Instead Caulker caught the break, Tottenham were fortified and they emerged as comfortable winners with Aaron Lennon punishing loose defending from Joe Bennett to lash home the clinching second goal. Bennett's day would get worse when he suffered a nasty-looking cut to his leg and was wheeled off on a stretcher.</p> <p>Lambert had used his substitutes and, with his team on the back foot for the final 12 minutes with 10 men, they narrowly avoided a more comprehensive defeat. Clint Dempsey missed a free header and Bale watched Brad Guzan touch his shot on to the far post and away. Lambert's work in progress remains unpredictable.</p> <p>\"We're disappointed because we had a big, big moment,\" Lambert said, referring to the Benteke header. \"You don't know if you're going to win it but it gives you a foothold in the game. It's a fine line whether you win or lose, a really fine line. When you have two big chances at a place like this, you've got to score at least one of them. You know it's not your day when a deflection goes in.\"</p> <p>Lambert found himself obliged to spend a portion of his post-match conference explaining the reasons for omitting Bent, whom he had stripped, earlier in the season, of the club captaincy. It was down purely to the formation he wanted to deploy at White Hart Lane, which was designed to counter opponents that attack in numbers on the flanks. Benteke, he said, was the better bet as the lone striker, with Bent preferring to play with \"somebody up there beside him\". Lambert said that Bent had been \"fine\" about the decision.</p> <p>Tottenham started brightly, with Bale prominent, even if he took a theatrical tumble under a challenge from Guzan that blotted his copybook. Bale flashed a shot past the far post while one of his whipped deliveries was almost turned home by the impressive Jan Vertonghen.</p> <p>Defoe flickered with his spin-and-shoot trick in what became a flat first half while, for Villa, Benteke stung Lloris' palms in the 22nd minute. Lloris was solid, showing authority in the air and reading the game astutely; he left his line to save in front of Agbonlahor after Holman had slid him through. Lloris' handling was true to deny Benteke in the 46th minute although the striker ought to have got his shot further away from him.</p> <p>Defoe thudded a second-half chance wide and he was angry when he was substituted, having failed to mark his 30th birthday with a goal. The chief angst, though, belonged to Benteke.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham Hotspur)</p>",
  "<p>Poinciana sits in the heart of the vote-rich Interstate-4 corridor where the battle for Florida \u2013 and quite possibly the White House itself \u2013 will soon be fought. This is the ultimate swing region, in the ultimate swing state, with Latino voters holding their fingers on the scale.</p> <p>\"The I-4 corridor generally is divided; whichever party can capture the voters generally does well,\" explains David Colburn, director of the Reubin O'D. Askew Institute on Politics and Society at the University of Florida. \"The southeastern part of the state typically votes Democrat, the northern part and significantly the southwest vote Republican.\"</p> <p>Poinciana is a bedroom community of 54,000 residents 20 minutes outside Orlando that started out as a retirement development 40 years ago. But the population here is no longer dominated by older, white retirees. Poinciana went from 65% white in 2000 to 51% Hispanic in 2010. Puerto Ricans make up almost 70% of the community's Hispanic population <a href=\"http://censusviewer.com/city/FL/Poinciana/2000\">with small numbers of Dominicans, Mexicans and Cubans mixed in</a>. These are the voters who could swing the state \u2013 if, that is, they show up to the polls. </p> <p>While Barack Obama can win a second term without a Florida victory, many analysts see no viable path to the White House for Republican challenger Mitt Romney if he loses the Sunshine State. Voters in Puerto Rico tend to favor Democratic candidates over Republican ones, and registration statistics in central Florida reflect this preference.</p> <p>However, almost a third of Hispanic voters here have no political party preference. It is these voters that Obama and Romney need to woo.</p> <p>Bush managed to win 52% of the vote in Poinciana in 2004, but Obama captured nearly 60% in 2008. Some think Romney could have swung Poinciana back to red by choosing the Hispanic Florida senator Marco Rubio as his running mate. Rubio won Poinciana in his 2010 bid for the US Senate, fending off both a Democrat and an independent in a contentious election.</p> <p>But to prevail, Romney will have to overcome the sense of disenfranchisement reflected in low turnout among the region's Hispanic population over the years. Whereas Puerto Rico <a href=\"http://www.homefacts.com/politics/Florida/Osceola-County/Poinciana.html\">enjoys an 80% voter turnout</a>, that number plummets to 17% <a href=\"http://www.eleccionespuertorico.org/2008/electorado.votante.html\">among Puerto Ricans living in Florida</a>.</p> <p>\"There's been very little incentive for candidates to get to know the community issues,\" Anthony Suarez, a Spanish-language radio host said.</p> <h2>'The poster child for the financial crisis'</h2> <p>For now, the economy is the top issue on the minds of residents, whether it be concerns over decreased home values or an unemployment rate above the national average. To win votes here, particularly among the politically disenchanted Puerto Rican population, the candidates' economic message needs to be strong.</p> <p>\"In 2006 we were the fastest-growing development community in the nation with waiting lists for houses and unbelievable growth. But during the 2008 recession Poinciana literally became the poster child for the financial crisis,\" resident Keith Laytham said.</p> <p>The growth was spurred on by a boom in the tourism industry around Orlando in the early 2000s. But people stopped taking expensive vacations when the economy deflated, leaving many of these new Latino arrivals without a job. Many are also under water on their housing, having bought homes at inflated prices that can now not be recouped.</p> <p>Results of a study conducted by the Pew Research Center last year show the median net worth for Hispanic households in Florida dropped by 88% between 2005 and 2009 and the median home value decreased by 72%. Poinciana has some of the highest rates of housing strife in the country \u2013 a quarter of its 24,000 homes have fallen into foreclosure in the last four years. \"You had people buying $250,000 homes at the height of the boom even though the median income in the county was $28,000,\" said Osceola County Commissioner Brandon Arrington. </p> <p>There are signs that the housing market may be bottoming out. And the unemployment rate in the area is finally moving in the right direction after peaking at 11.5% in January 2010, though it <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.fl_orlando_msa.htm\">still remains slightly above the national average</a>.</p> <p>\"It's the regular, working stiffs who are affected when there are cutbacks. The majority of the people here work in the hospitality industry or have construction jobs,\" Poinciana resident Roberto Sanchez said.</p> <p>Sanchez, whose parents are from Puerto Rico, moved to the community eight years ago after losing his job in New Jersey. He was laid off from another construction job at the height of the unemployment crisis but has managed to find work as a quality control technician for an asphalt company.</p> <p>He is frustrated with the stalled economy. \"We don't think the government represents us. I have issues with both sides \u2013 the Democrats because of the unfulfilled promises and the Republicans because it seems they only care about rich, white people.\"</p> <p>Many local Hispanics of Puerto Rican descent feel they are treated as second-class citizens by both parties. \"If you go with the Republicans, you're going to be second class to the Cubans. If you go with the Democrats, you're going to be second to the African American community,\" Suarez said.</p> <p>Overall, though, Suarez sees a contrast between the two main parties ahead of the presidential election. \"Right now the Republicans are doing everything they can to ensure Poinciana stays Democrat and the Democrats are doing everything they can to attract them.\"</p> <p>Danny Sexton, chairman of the Osceola County Republican party, admits that he has a daunting task ahead of him when it comes to engaging Hispanic voters. \"If you're going to win an election in this state, especially from Osceola County south, you've got to figure out how you're gonna appeal to Hispanic voters and independents because Republicans are not going to win if they don't,\" he said.</p> <p>As chairman of the county's Republican party, it's obvious who Sexton is pulling for. But he has his eyes on a longer-term prize.</p> <p>\"I want people in the state party when this election cycle is over to be able to look at Osceola County and say: 'They got it right, they figured out a way to reach out to an incredibly diverse population, a changing population. A population that 10 years ago looked entirely different than it does today and that we figured out how to appeal to people's best interest.'\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>France has increased security at Jewish religious sites after blank shots were fired at a synagogue west of Paris and police arrested 11 people on suspicion of being part of an Islamist jihadist cell.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande held talks with Jewish community leaders at the Elys\u00e9e and announced that security would be stepped up immediately at religious sites. He said the state was \"totally mobilised against terrorist threats\" and \"intransigent\" in fighting racism and antisemitism.</p> <p>On Saturday evening, blank bullets were fired from a car at a synagogue in the Paris suburb of Argenteuil while worshippers were inside the building. Earlier on Saturday, police raids outside Paris, Cannes and Strasbourg led to a series of arrests in connection with what the state prosecutor described as a suspected radical Islamist cell.</p> <p>The main target in the raids was a 33-year-old man in Strasbourg whose DNA was found on a grenade used in a daylight attack on a Jewish kosher grocery store in Sarcelles, north of Paris, last month, in which one person was wounded. When police arrived to arrest him before dawn on Saturday, he opened fire with a handgun and was shot dead by officers.</p> <p>A convicted drug dealer, he was described as a \"delinquent who converted to radical Islam\" and was said by police to have been determined to \"end as a martyr\". Three of the people arrested had a criminal record for offences such drug-trafficking, theft and violence.</p> <p>The Paris prosecutor Fran\u00e7ois Molins said the police searches had found Islamist literature and a list of Jewish associations in the Paris area. The suspects were French and recent converts to Islam. He said investigators were looking at whether the cell had been preparing to carry out attacks.</p> <p>Hollande warned that France's Muslim community must not be tarnished or stigmatised by the arrests. \"They must not suffer, they are also victims of radical Islamism,\" he said. French Muslim organisations denounced the synagogue attack.</p> <p>France is still on edge after Mohamed Merah, a 23-year-old unemployed panel-beater from Toulouse, went on a 10-day killing spree in March, murdering three paratroopers and shooting children and a rabbi at the gates of a Jewish school. Merah died in a hail of police bullets as he leapt from a balcony after a 32-hour siege at his flat.</p> <p>Questions remain over failings in the operation and how Merah \u2013 who claimed inspiration from al-Qaida, was heavily armed, on police intelligence files and had been under surveillance \u2013 was not picked up earlier.</p> <p>Molins was careful not to draw links with Merah, who studied at an Islamist paramilitary camp in Pakistan, saying officials did not believe the men arrested on Saturday had trained abroad.</p> <p>The interior minister Manuel Valls, dubbed Hollande's vice-president for his prominence in the media and tough stance on crime, warned of terrorist networks \"in our neighbourhoods\".</p> <p>\"This isn't about foreigners, it's about converted French people or French Muslims. But let's not confuse these people with the Muslim community in France,\" he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a storm was brewing over inflammatory language after Jean-Francois Cop\u00e9, a candidate for leadership of Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP party who has previously complained of \"anti-white racism\", told an anecdote at a rally about a child who \"had his pain au chocolat grabbed from him by thugs who said there must be no eating during Ramadan\".</p> <p>The former Sarkozy minister Fran\u00e7ois Baroin, who is supporting Cop\u00e9's opponent, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, warned against \"toxic and dangerous little phrases.\" The Socialist prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, warned against what he called a \"stigmatising\" discourse against minorities.</p>",
  "<p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland wants to seize interview material from the Sunday Telegraph and American broadcaster CBS connected to an IRA bomber's claim that Gerry Adams ordered one of the most notorious murders of the Troubles.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the PSNI is seeking to obtain notes and video footage from the paper and the New York based television station in relation to Dolours Price's allegation that the Sinn Fein president was in charge of a specialist IRA unit that \"disappeared'' and killed mother of 10 Jean McConville.</p> <p>In the United States, the PSNI is already engaged in a lengthy legal battle soon to reach the US Supreme Court in its attempt to take tapes from Boston College that include Price's testimony of her time in the IRA. The police want to use the Boston College interviews with IRA members with the material from the Sunday Telegraph and CBS as part of its investigation into the 1972 kidnapping and secret murder of the west Belfast widow.</p> <p>An award winning journalist who set up the IRA and loyalist archive for Boston College said the PSNI's latest move demonstrated that the police were \"laying siege\" to free, open journalism.</p> <p>A PSNI spokeswoman said on Friday the police were \"pursuing all lines of inquiry in relation to the murder of Jean McConville.'' The Guardian can reveal that this includes the most up to date interview with Dolours Price, the former Old Bailey bomber who now lives in North Dublin.</p> <p>McConville was abducted from her home in the Divis Flats complex by an IRA unit just before Christmas 1972. The Provisional IRA accused her of being an informer who worked for the British Army \u2013 a charge her family has always disputed.</p> <p>She became the most famous of 16 IRA victims known as the disappeared because after being interrogated and shot, their bodies were buried in secret locations mainly across the border in the Irish Republic. In her interview last month, Price claimed to be part of a highly secretive IRA unit called the Unknowns who were tasked with targeting suspected informers in the community, abducting them, killing them and burying them in covert locations.</p> <p>Price also said that she took Jean McConville to her death across the border after she was dragged from her home at gunpoint in front of her children.</p> <p>\"I drove away Jean McConville. I don't know who gave the instructions to execute her. Obviously it was decided between the General Headquarters staff and the people in Belfast. Gerry Adams would have been part of that negotiation as to what was to happen to her.</p> <p>\"I had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road and she'd been arrested by Cumann [IRA's female unit] women and held for a couple of days. She got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the Legion of Mary to a place of safety.</p> <p>\"It wasn't my decision to disappear her, thank God. All I had to do was drive her from Belfast to Dundalk. I even got her fish and chips and cigarettes before I left her.''</p> <p>Price was unrepentant about her alleged role in the disappearance and death of McConville. \"You don't deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person as she was but you do deserve to die if you are an informer, I do believe that. Particularly in a war, that is the Republican way,'' she told the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>CBS confirmed it had received a letter from the PSNI about the Price interview adding \"we are looking into the issues raised in the letter.\" The Sunday Telegraph declined to comment but it is understood the PSNI has been in contact with the paper.</p> <p>The director of the Belfast Project for Boston College, Ed Moloney, said he sincerely hoped both CBS and the Sunday Telegraph would resist police attempts to subpoena their material.</p> <p>\"Clearly this case is developing into a major assault on privacy. Not content with assailing academic rights, the PSNI are now set to lay siege to the media as well. Where will this stop?\" he said.</p> <p>Moloney added: \"It is clear that the PSNI is substituting the efforts of journalists for basic detective work.\"</p> <p>Sinn Fein and even some of its opponents in the Irish media have claimed Price is motivated by a long-running enmity towards Adams, and is using the McConville murder to damage him and his party. Adams has strenuously denied not only involvement in the McConville disappearance and murder but of ever being involved in the IRA.</p> <p>Price does admit that she is engaged in a \"score settling'' operation against Adams because he denies his alleged IRA past. Her critics, including some commentators in the Dublin press who have traditionally opposed the IRA, claim she is trying to damage the peace process in her feud with Adams.</p> <p>But Seamus McKendry, Jean McConville's son-in-law and long time campaigner for the \"disappeared'', told the Guardian he welcomed the news that the PSNI wanted to seize the Sunday Telegraph and CBS material relating to Price's latest allegations.</p> <p>\"Helen [Jean McConville's oldest daughter] and I would be very much in favour of this move by the police. Every piece of the jigsaw is important in terms of the police building a case on Jean's murder. So just as we have always supported the PSNI in their bid to get the Boston College tapes we think it is entirely justified that they are able to pore over the interviews the paper and the broadcaster carried out,' he said.</p> <p>McKendry also called on the Garda Sioch\u00e1na to arrest Dolours Price following her claims in the Sunday Telegraph and on CBS. \"She is living openly in Malahide, north Dublin, so I don't see why the Garda cannot arrest and question her about what she said in her very own words. I was at Jean's inquest and all the evidence pointed to her being shot dead in County Louth in the Irish Republic, which means the crime was committed in the Garda's jurisdiction. So it's up to the Garda to question her,\" he added.</p> <p>The IRA only admitted in 1999 that it had been behind Jean McConville's disappearance and murder. Republicans had previously spread the false story across west Belfast that the widow had abandoned her 10 children \u2013 many of whom were later placed in care homes \u2013 and run off to England with a British soldier. Her remains were finally located in August 2003 at Templetown beach in County Louth.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Krawitz, from Elliston, Virginia, suffered a car accident while serving in the US air force which left him permanently disabled and in chronic pain.</p> <p>Years later he received a prescription for medical marijuana while abroad, which, when used with other pain treatment, stabilised his condition for the first time.</p> <p>But when the department of veteran affairs found out about his cannabis prescription, they asked him to undergo a drug test, he said, which he refused.</p> <p>They have now denied him further treatment.</p> <p>Later this month, Krawitz, 49, and other advocates for medical marijuana will go before the US court of appeal as part of a historic lawsuit that they hope will challenge the federal government's classification of marijuana.</p> <p>Under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified alongside heroin as a dangerous drug, with no medical benefits. Advocates argue that marijuana has a medical benefit and so should be reclassified.</p> <p>A wide range of US organisations support either medical access to cannabis, its reclassification or both. They include two of nation's largest physician groups, the American Medical Association and the American College of Physicians, in addition to the American Nurses Association, the Federation of American Scientists and the American Academy of Family Physicians.</p> <p>Oral arguments in the case are scheduled to be heard at the US court of appeal for the DC circuit on October 16.</p> <p>It is the result of a long legal battle by the Americans for Safe Access (ASA), a group of physicians, medical professionals and patients advocating legal access to marijuana for medical use and research.</p> <p>It marks the first time in 20 years the scientific evidence regarding the therapeutic value of marijuana will be reviewed by the courts. Previous efforts have not been successful.</p> <p>\"Medical marijuana patients are finally getting their day in court,\" said Joe Elford, chief counsel with ASA. \"This is a rare opportunity for patients to confront politically motivated decision-making with scientific evidence of marijuana's medical efficacy.\"</p> <h2>Federal government says drug has no proven medical benefit</h2> <p>The case began more than a decade ago, when Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis (CRC) filed its petition.</p> <p>In that time, ASA says, much has changed, and the government's position is out of step with increasing evidence of the benefits of the drug.</p> <p>Steph Sherer, executive director of ASA said: \"At the heart of this issue of the scheduling of marijuana and the federal government's refusal to look at the research that's out there every day is a bigger gap growing between patients and doctors and the federal government.\"</p> <p>Advocates say that even the therapeutic research required to prove the case for the beneficial effects of the drug is subject to a unique and overly rigorous approval process.</p> <p>While there is no conclusive scientific evidence in favour of medical marijuana, the research that does exist indicates it can be effective.</p> <p>In a conference call sponsored by ASA, Dr Donald Abrams, director of clinical programs at San Francisco general hospital, told reporters research had shown cannabis benefited patients suffering from HIV.</p> <p>He also said he recommended it to his cancer patients as treatment for a variety of symptoms.</p> <p>\"In my practice every day as a cancer specialist I see patients who have loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting from their chemotherapy, pain on and off of opiates, anxiety, depression and insomnia,\" Abrams said. He added that cannabis could effectively treat all of those symptoms in lieu of five separate drugs.</p> <p>Krawitz said: \"The definition of cannabis as schedule I has caused my fellow patients to be imprisoned, denied work, housing, right to own a firearm, a place on a transplant list, and of greatest concern to me, is the latest casualty of the drug war, my VA doctor.\"</p> <p>In its decision last year rejecting ASA's petition to reschedule marijuana, which has since been appealed, the drug enforcement agency concluded there was no substantial evidence that marijuana should be removed from schedule 1.</p> <p>The DEA included the required scientific assessment from the US department of health and human services (HHS) which had been prepared five years earlier.</p> <p>The HSS found there were no \"NDA-quality [new drug application] studies that have assessed (marijuana) \u2026 for any medical condition\".</p> <p>It went on to say that there was no consensus of medical opinion on the medical applications of marijuana.</p> <p>Patient advocates claim that marijuana is treated unlike any other controlled substance and say that successive petitions to reclassify the drug have been blocked by politics.</p> <p>ASA say that there have been no NDA-quality drug studies of other substances, for instance Platelet rich Plasma (PrP) treatment of Achilles tendinitis, that are still widely accepted for medical use.</p> <p>They cite the support of the AMA and the ACP and other groups as evidence of a growing medical consensus.</p> <p>The AMA concluded in 2009 that \"short term controlled trials indicate that smoked cannabis reduces neuropathic pain, improves appetite and caloric intake especially in patients with reduced muscle mass, and may relieve spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis.\"</p> <p>Four states have filed petitions to reschedule the drug, including Washington, Rhode Island, Vermont and Colorado.</p> <p>The drug remains illegal under federal law, although <a href=\"http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881\">medical marijuana is legal in 17 states</a>.</p> <p>Government authorities have re-enforced the federal law by raiding dispensaries in states including California and Washington.</p>",
  "<p>Political correctness has caught up with Britain's deaf community. It is no longer acceptable to sign a slanted eye when talking about the Chinese or to mime a hook nose when referring to Jewish people. The flick of a limp wrist is now an offensive signal for homosexuals. A finger pointing to an imaginary spot in the middle of a forehead is no longer appropriate as the sign for India [see footnote].</p> <p>The first UK-wide survey into how British sign language (BSL) is used by deaf people of different ages has found a seismic shift has taken place in the signs used by different generations.</p> <p>For deaf people aged between 16 and 30, the only culturally sensitive way to indicate China is to draw the right hand from the signer's heart horizontally across their chest, then down towards the hip, indicating the shape of a Mao jacket.</p> <p>Their sign for a Jewish man or woman is a hand resting against the chin and making a short movement down, in the shape of a beard. A gay person is indicated with an upright thumb on one hand in the palm of the other, wobbling from side to side. India is a mime of the triangular shape of the subcontinent.</p> <p>Only older British signers still refer to France by mimicking the twirling of a moustache. Younger users of BSL mimic a cockerel's comb \u2013 a symbol of France.</p> <p>Other signs have changed despite there being no offensive connotations. The new sign for Ireland mimics the plucking of a harp, for example, while the traditional sign, opening one's fingers from an O shape to a U, was said to derive from the shape of shamrocks.</p> <p>Other signs have not changed: all British signers put their fist to their forehead with a finger pointing straight up, mimicking the shape of a Prussian spiked helmet, to refer to Germans.</p> <p>The three-year<a href=\"http://www.bslcorpusproject.org/\" title=\"\"> BSL Corpus project</a> filmed almost 250 deaf people from eight cities across the UK to find how changes in society had affected the signs they used for 102 key concepts. The findings have been presented at a series of peer-previewed conferences both in the UK and internationally. But the discovery that BSL has become more culturally sensitive, with signs for countries changing more quickly than signs for any other group, has caused the deaf community concern.</p> <p>\"We are nervous about this being seen as another example of political correctness because the changes are more about evolution rather than dictat of some body that approves language,\" said Gwilym Morris, from the deafness cognition and language research centre (DCal) at University College London.</p> <p>Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the research is the first national web-based and publicly accessible BSL corpus. It is one of the few large sign language projects ever undertaken and only the second, after one in the Netherlands, to have video data <a href=\"http://www.bslcorpusproject.org/data/\" title=\"\">online</a>. The research is being used to create the first online dictionary and reference source for BSL grammar.</p> <p>Dr Kearsy Cormier led the three and a half year project. She hopes the research will improve the education of deaf children. \"It will also help us to better understand regional variation, such as different signs for green or for the number six and the change in vocabulary and grammar of BSL, such as new signs for sleep or China,\" she writes on<a href=\"http://www.bslcorpusproject.org/project-information/\" title=\"\"> the website</a>.</p> <p>\"It will help relate those changes to social factors, such as a signer's regional background, age or social class \u2013 a topic of some debate in the British deaf community.\"</p> <p>Professor Bencie Woll, director of DCal, said the project was the first to document changes in BSL. \"The changes are exactly like the changes to spoken English,\" she said. \"There are all sorts of words we used to refer to people 30 years ago that we've stopped using. The difference is that the change in BSL has been very rapid because it wasn't until deaf people were able to see each other over the internet that they were able to communicate with anyone who wasn't standing in front of them and see how foreign signers referred to themselves.</p> <p>\"The younger deaf community doesn't use these old signs because of a clear process of political correctness, in the same way that the hearing community no longer calls gay people 'pansies' or 'queer',\" she said. \"But what the hearing community doesn't understand about sign language is that even though the traditional signs are now considered offensive, they are not producing a real-life insult when they are used because they are not just visual representations of a concept.\"</p> <p>But, said Woll, just as with spoken words, some deaf sub-communities are reclaiming signs considered offensive for anyone outside their immediate group to use. \"Gay deaf people use the old sign for gay, and disabled deaf people use the traditional sign for disabled, even though no one from outside that group who was socially sensitive would use those signs any more,\" said Woll.</p> <p>Most significant, said Woll, is the sign for deaf. \"Deaf people don't call themselves 'hearing impaired' or 'hard of hearing',\" she said. \"They have reclaimed the word because for them, it doesn't mean they can't hear: it means they're part of a community, with its own identity.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This clarification was published on 23 December 2012: An article about a UK-wide study to track variation and change in British Sign Language referred to changes that had evolved in signs for a variety of concepts. To clarify: the British Sign Language Corpus Project did not collect data about or document changes in signs referring to Jewish and gay people, nor did it provide any evidence of claims made about changes in signs for countries including India, Germany, France and Ireland.

Guadalupe, a one-square-mile community of 5,500 perched on the edge of southeast Phoenix and 61% Hispanic, was the first to stand up to the sheriff.</p> <p>As the 2012 presidential election looms, Guadalupe's counter-punch to Arpaio shows just how explosive the power of the Latino community might be throughout the state, particularly in energizing the youth. Just how much this will matter in November remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: the political momentum has radically shifted, and the Latino electorate can feel the wind on its backs.</p> <p>Battered by Arpaio's sweeps and the nation's harshest series of anti-immigrant legislation for most of the last decade, the state's Hispanic community is now an angry and energized demographic that is mobilizing and fighting back.</p> <p>In the last four years, Hispanics have elected a growing number of candidates to the Phoenix city council and state legislature. Last November, they recalled the roaring lion of the state's anti-immigrant image, former state senator Russell Pearce. It was a humiliating fall for the leader of the Republicans in the Arizona senate who was the architect behind the nationally polarizing \"papers please\" law SB1070, and a key supporter of a ballot initiative passed in 2004 that demanded proof of citizenship for public services. Arpaio, too, faces a civil lawsuit in the Arizona courts for alleged racial profiling though a second legal challenge by the US justice department <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/31/joe-arpaio-investigation-_n_1848384.html \">was recently dropped</a>.</p> <p>On the night of one of his raids in 2008, mayor Rebecca Jimenez met Arpaio face-to-face, surrounded by 250 angry community members as his deputies flooded her town. She handed him a statement from the town's council, telling him not to come back.</p> <p>\"He erupted.0Hhe was so mad that spit flew on my face,\" Jimenez said. \"He told me: 'You don't want us back?' And I said: 'No, we don't want you back.' He said: 'Too bad, I'm coming back tomorrow.' But he didn't.\"</p> <p>Guadalupe tried to sever its policing contract with Arpaio but failed.<br>Nevertheless, Arpaio attempted to pull out his deputies, leaving Guadalupe defenseless. In the proceeding year, the town filed a federal lawsuit against the sheriff for canceling services over being criticized. It became an embarrassing battle for him that played out in the media.</p> <p>Although Guadalupe is small, it illustrates in concentrated form the potential clout of Hispanic politics when the community is mobilised. Few think Latinos will tip this November's vote in Obama's favor in Arizona, but the Hispanic population is certain to climb its from current 30%. Hispanic youth, who make up 43% of all K-12 students in the state, will come of voting age, and some political observers predict that the effects of SB1070, which was recently upheld in part by the US supreme court, will serve to further accelerate Latino political engagement.</p> <p>\"Within 10 to 15 years, we could be a state like New Mexico, or more likely, California,\" said Arizona State University political science professor Rodolfo Espino, referring to two states with Hispanic populations of 46% and 38% respectively. California is a Democratic fortress, while New Mexico has been decided by a few thousand votes either way in two out of the past three presidential elections. </p> <p>Arizona Hispanics are expected to represent at least 12% of the electorate or more in the upcoming election. In 2010, Hispanics represented a record 18% of the electorate, according to Antonio Gonzalez of the William C Velasquez Institute.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you have to get kicked in the shins really hard so you feel the pain,\" said the Democratic congressman for Tucson Raul Grijalva, who called for a boycott of his own state when SB1070 passed.</p> <h2>'The train's already left the station'</h2> <p>Andrew Sanchez was elected to Guadalupe's town council at the age of just 29 in the aftermath of Arpaio's sweep on the town. He remembers at least 50 deputies, some on bikes, others on horses or in helicopters, and the bomb squad.</p> <p>\"When you see a public official at the level of sheriff lying about a small town that he thought had no push and no influence and he could just bash us, and beat us, it hurt,\" said Sanchez. He takes offence to the sheriff's assumption that many residents of Guadalupe were in the country illegally.</p> <p>Guadalupe is largely comprised of members of the Yaqui Indian tribe, who, at the turn of the 20th century, fled across the border after a failed uprising just before the Mexican revolution. Today, the town known for its Lent and Easter ceremonies remains beset by alcoholism, domestic violence and all the trappings of \"historical trauma\", said Yaqui cultural sensitivity specialist Rafael Armenta. Per capita income is just over $11,000, <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104652.html\">one-third of the statewide average.</a> </p> <p>It is the Hispanic youth, like Sanchez, who are spearheading the new political push. The demographics are irreversible, Grijalva said. \"You can put impediments in front of it, you can make it difficult, but the train's already left the station.\"</p> <p>Young Dreamers \u2013 undocumented Latino students who could become permanent residents if the Dream Act ever passed \u2013 meet late one recent night in Phoenix, crafting strategy on how to get-out-the-vote to their communities.</p> <p>Daniel Rodriguez, one such Dreamer, had his educational hopes derailed after Proposition 300 passed in 2006. The measure forced him, and all other undocumented students, to pay out-of-state college tuition, which was three times as much, and he lost financial aid.</p> <p>\"What people did inadvertently in taking away our education was really release the energy that immigrant youth have,\" Rodriguez said.</p> <p>The group he helped co-found years ago, the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, is raising money to send him back to law school.</p> <p>The youth first saw the extent of their power in 2008, when a grassroots door-to-door campaign tripled the Hispanic voter turnout in a southwest Phoenix city council district and produced an upset win for Michael Nowakowski. His campaign manager, Ruben Gallego, was elected to the state legislature two years later aged 28.</p> <p>Three years later, another Nowakowski disciple, Daniel Valenzuela made national headlines when his young volunteers, \"Team Awesome,\" knocked on 72,000 doors to get him on the Phoenix city council. Most recently, Hispanic voters scored their biggest victory yet with the recall of Pearce, the first-ever Arizona legislator removed. It was spearheaded by Citizens For A Better Arizona, an activist group led by Randy Parraz.</p> <p>\"Brother and sisters,\" Parraz yelled during a mid-June meeting that packed a local sanctuary, \"this is happening under our watch! Some of you go back a generation, and have fought these fights, but these fights are not over!\"</p> <p>As the political terrain shifts, one recent poll put Obama only three points behind Romney in Arizona. A late-June poll from Rasmussen by contrast had Romney comfortably ahead by 54 to 41. Romney has yet to open up a field office in Arizona, and party leaders insist the state is not in play.</p> <p>As for Guadalupe, it must wait to see if the upcoming election ends Arpaio's reign. \"Regardless, the culture has been set,\" Sanchez said.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, he began sitting in on police training sessions at Maricopa County sheriff's office. \"I'm probably the last person you'd expect to see in that class,\" Sanchez said.</p> <p>He takes his 19-year-old nephew to the police academy classes there. He says he thinks the young man will \"be a great community leader some day\".</p> <p>\"We need to take notes and understand this department. That's the best way to help our people,\" Sanchez says.</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, like most institutions of its size in the US and Europe, has seen its fair share of lawsuits and controversies surrounding its collection. It <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1349467084-NTd7MIbMXxJ/LeBfgJGFSA\">returned nearly two dozen antiquities to Italy in 2006</a>, as well as work acquired via <a href=\"http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr071030.htm\">Nazi looting</a>.</p> <p>But now the Met is facing a very different kind of restitution battle. The Turkish government is insisting it is the rightful owner of 18 objects from the collection of Norbert Schimmel, a Met trustee and one of the last century's most astute <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/22/obituaries/norbert-schimmel-collector-dies-specialist-in-antiquities-was-85.html\">collectors of Mediterranean antiquities</a>.</p> <p>Unlike the Italian claim, and unlike in the cases of Holocaust victims' families, the proof here is scant to nonexistent. What's more, both the US and Turkey are signatories to a Unesco convention stating that if a cultural object left the country in which it was produced before the year 1970, then it's free to circulate. That cutoff date puts almost all the Met's antiquities in the clear.</p> <p>But Turkey doesn't care, it now seems: it's citing its own law, more than a century old, to insist that the artifacts belong to it.</p> <p>You might be tempted to dismiss these claims as antique, gold-hilted saber-rattling. But the Turkish culture ministry can apply formidable pressure. It's nearly impossible these days for a museum like the Met to mount an ambitious exhibition without the permission, and sometimes the aid, of national governments; and Turkey is now blocking loans to museums it says have what's rightfully its.</p> <p>This year's Met mega-exhibition of Byzantine art had to make do without Turkish loans (though the Met's curators coyly say they never wanted any). So did the British Museum's spring show about the Hajj: while Turkish museums agreed to lend 35 objects to the BM, the culture ministry <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Turkey-blocks-loans-to-US-and-UK/25869\">shut the lending down</a>. Ankara is also<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21555531\"> playing hardball</a> with the Louvre, the V&amp;A, the Pergamon and pretty much every other encyclopedic museum in the west.</p> <p>Museum officials are calling this blackmail. They may have a point but it's one inflected with a deep irony. Rich people take poor people's stuff \u2013 such is the arc of history. But guess who's got the money now?</p> <p>The Turkish economy has come down from the vertiginous heights of 2010 and 2011, when annual growth exceeded 8%, but the country remains one of the only economic winners of the past few years \u2013 Turkey is ready to play in the big time. It's already at the top table of geopolitics (the G20) and defense (Nato). Its failure to get into the EU now looks like a blessing in disguise. Its retaliation against Syria this past week marks not only its military might, but also <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-press-review-on-the-turkish-syrian-conflict-a-859675.html\">US and EU dependence</a> on Turkey in a region changing too fast for western diplomats to handle. And now, naturally, Turkey wants to make their mark in the cultural sphere as well.</p> <p>\"Artifacts have souls and historical memories,\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/arts/design/turkeys-efforts-to-repatriate-art-alarm-museums.html?pagewanted=all\">according to Ertugrul Gunay</a>, Turkey's pugnacious culture minister. \"When they are repatriated to their countries, the balance of nature will be restored.\"</p> <p>That nationalistic statement puts Turkey in the vanguard of a troubling tendency, one seen everywhere from Israel to China: that the nation state has an infinite claim to a cultural heritage that may date back thousands of years before the state's foundation. Gunay's appeal to the \"balance of nature\" is telling. He conceives of the nation state as something organic, an unchanging territorial bond, rather than a relatively recent phenomenon in world history.</p> <p>It's worth recalling that the Turks, or at least their historical ancestors, were involved in the hottest cultural property dispute of them all. The tussle over the Elgin Marbles, in the British Museum, is usually seen as an Anglo-Greek affair. But of course, it was the Ottoman Empire that took Elgin's money, and it's<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3841179.stm\"> Ottoman documents</a> that, so say the Brits, prove the legality of Elgin's \"purchase\" (more like bribe).</p> <p>But that case only highlights that when it comes to cultural restitution, national boundaries are not very helpful guides. Cultures are not ahistorical and immutable. They change all the time. And they certainly don't line up easily with the borders on our maps, to say nothing of the governments that delimit them.</p> <p>I'm hardly against restitution when the case is clear. The Met and the Turks have actually been here before, under different circumstances, though America's few remaining arts desks have failed to mention it. Back in 1993, the museum settled out of court with the Turkish government to return a collection of over 300 gold and silver objects, which the Turks convincingly demonstrated had been stolen. The artifacts, known collectively as the Lydian Hoard, are now exhibited in the western Turkish city of Usak. Their return to Turkey angered some of the die-hard defenders of the universal museum, and their case was bolstered by the revelation that <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nj-ozxT1ynoC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;ots=zBwLkZW8Sn&amp;dq=golden%20hippocampus%20usak&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q=golden%20hippocampus%20usak&amp;f=false\">fewer than a thousand people</a> visited the treasures over five whole years.</p> <p>The universal museum, a legacy of western imperialism, is always going to be disputed. In the case of the Lydian Hoard, though, the situation was plain: no appeal to Enlightenment values and educational imperatives could justify the purchase of clearly stolen objects. The Schimmel collection is a wholly different case. What's at issue is not justice and fairness, but nationalism and power.</p> <p>The small crimes of theft and looting, when they can be demonstrated, should be put right. But there's no way to dismantle the whole museum, just as there's no way to turn back the clock on imperialism and war. </p> <p>Turkey should know this, of course. Tellingly, while the Turkish cultural authorities are keen to get their hands on the Met's antiquities, they're much less forthcoming about the collections in their own museums \u2013 good fractions of which come from Lebanon, Greece, the former Yugoslavia and other regions once controlled by the Ottoman Empire. If they're not careful, the next collections in dispute might be their own.</p>",

In a move backed by the <a href=\"http://www.nuj.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Union of Journalists</a>, campaigners want to see a new independent regulator introduced, backed by a statutory underpinning.</p> <p>\"All that may come out of Leveson is a suggestion for instead of the press regulating themselves is that there is to be an independent regulator,\" Grant said. Any new regulator needed a \"tiny dab of statute\" in order for it to be listened to, he said.</p> <p>\"It's actually the way that doctors are now regulated, the way solicitors are regulated and they're not complaining. It's a tiny, tiny dab of statute to set this thing up because otherwise the danger is newspaper editors will just say: 'Who are you? What is this institution, this new body, this new regulator? We're not doing what you say, we're not paying your fines.'</p> <p>\"So you just need that tiny dab of statute to set the thing up, and I personally do not see the slightest danger to freedom of speech or freedom of expression.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who is due to meet Hacked Off campaigners during the Conservative party conference this week, told Marr he did not want to prejudge the outcome of the Leveson report. He made clear that the status quo was not an option, but said he was opposed to \"heavy-handed state intervention\" in the activities of the press.</p> <p>Asked whether he would stick to his reported promise to implement Leveson's recommendations, providing they were not \"bonkers\", Cameron replied: \"Absolutely.\" But he added: \"We must wait for what Lord Justice Leveson says. I don't want to try and prejudge it \u2026 We don't want heavy-handed state intervention. We've got to have a free press: they've got to be free to uncover wrongdoing, to follow the evidence, to do the job in our democracy they need to do.</p> <p>\"But, on the other hand, it's quite clear people have been abused, people's families and lives have been torn up by press intrusion \u2013 the status quo is not an option. Let's let him do his work. I fully intend to, and I think that this goes right across the parties: we all want to put in place a sensible regulatory system. We're hoping Lord Leveson is going to crack this problem for us, but we must let him do his work first.\"</p>",

He continued: \"This means that the hands that once held rifles will be put to use tilling land, selling produce, manning work stations and opening doorways of opportunity.\"</p> <p>The deal, to be formally signed on 15 October, sets out the broad outlines for a new region called Bangsamoro, which would enjoy considerable autonomy, with Manila retaining control over defence, foreign policy and broad macro-economic policy. The MILF will be tasked with helping create a new \"basic law\" for the region, with final agreement scheduled for 2016, the end of Aquino's term as president.</p> <p>The deal was welcomed by the US and UK, among others, with the British <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=819140082\" title=\"\">foreign secretary, William Hague, saying</a> it had \"the potential finally to end the long-running conflict\".</p> <p>Risks remain: in 2008 the Philippines' supreme court decreed another agreement unconstitutional, beginning a new wave of clashes that saw 750,000 people displaced. There is also the possibility of disruption from hardline splinter groups.</p> <p>The MILF itself came into being in the 1980s, when another group, the Moro National Liberation Front, agreed on autonomy rather than independence. The MILF's main negotiator said the 11,000-strong group's fighters would not lay down their arms until the agreement was finalised.</p> <p>However, the head government negotiator, Marvic Leonen, told the Guardian the MILF leadership appeared \"principled but pragmatic\". He said: \"Of course, there are other armed groups on the ground but the agreement also has a section on how there can be co-operation between government and MILF troops to maintain peace in the area. There has been a ceasefire between the MILF and the government and, as far as we know, this year there have been zero skirmishes between them.\"</p> <p>Kristian Herbolzheimer, Philippines programme director for <a href=\"http://www.c-r.org/\" title=\"\">Conciliation Resources</a>, a London-based NGO that was part of international efforts to assist the negotiations, said the deal was a \"very good framework\" for lasting peace. He said: \"This is probably the biggest milestone of the last 15 years of negotiations. At the same time, of course it's not the end point. This is a framework agreement, a road map of what has to follow. In Mindanao, of course, there have been several 'final' agreements which did not end the conflict.\"</p> <p>Both sides made significant concessions, he said: the MILF in agreeing to autonomy rather than independence and the government conceding that a new framework for greater self-government in Mindanao had to be shaped by the rebel group. This placed trust in the MILF to bring into the fold dissenting voices.</p> <p>He said: \"It's a huge responsibility on the MILF's shoulders right now. They will lead this drafting process and they will have to prove to the Bangsamoros and the Filipinos that they are not sectarian and can reach out even to those who think differently.\"</p> <p>If it comes into being, Bangsamoro will be a significantly deprived region of around 4 million people, with many investors likely to be put off by poor infrastructure and the potential for violence. However, this could change with the exploitation of significant oil and gas fields in the Sulu Sea off Mindanao.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Good morning everyone. Today both the men's and women's T20 tournaments reach a denouement in Sri Lanka. England's women are first up before the hosts take on West Indies this afternoon (2pm BST). Charlotte Edwards and co overcame Australia in the group stage but in 40 overs, anything can happen in the final.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>England have won the toss and will bowl first</strong></p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>England:</strong> Charlotte Edwards (capt), Laura Marsh, Sarah Taylor (wk), Lydia Greenway, Arran Brindle, Danielle Wyatt, Jenny Gunn, Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, Danielle Hazell, Holly Colvin.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Umpires:</strong> Billy Bowden and Marais Erasmus<br><strong>Third umpire:</strong> Tony Hill<br><strong>Match referee:</strong> Graeme Labrooy</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>The teams are out for the national anthems...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>Meg Lanning and Alyssa Healy, niece of Ian Healy, will open the batting for Australia. Katherine Brunt opens the bowling for England....</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1st over: Australia 4-0 (Lanning 4, Healy 0)</strong> Strong fielding in the covers as Meg Lanning can't score off the first three deliveries, although she looks to be finding the middle of the bat. Brunt is getting a bit of outswing out on what looks like a belting Colombo pitch. Fourth ball now and Brunt steams in...cut away perfectly for four. That will calm the nerves for Australia. Can Brunt respond? The next ball is a pacy yorker but it slides through to Sarah Taylor. Just four runs from the over. Good start for England.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Lanning 6, Healy 4)</strong> Danielle Hazell with her off-breaks takes the ball in hand. Healy gets off the mark immediately as she guides one to mid-off where Shrubsole misjudges the bounce and gifts Australia a single. After another single Healy cuts one down to the third man boundary and they come back for a quick two, some good running there. Hazell drops one in short and it's pulled through mid-wicket, but there is a fielder out on the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Australia 26-0 (Lanning 15, Healy 10)</strong> Disaster for Brunt with her first delivery of her second over. It's a no ball as she steps over the line and the half-volley is duly dispatched through the covers for for four. So, it's a free hit for Australia now and Lanning swats it over the infield on the off side for another boundary. Excellent shot and already this over is turning into an expensive one. A couple of sngles follow as Brunt's line appears a little wayward, she strays too straight and that is a result of being dispatched earlier on. The final ball is pulled away for another four, a filthy short offer. Not good from Brunt.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4th over: Australia 32-0 (Lanning 21, Healy 10)</strong> Hazell continues with her off spin but at the moment Australia are looking settled. Lanning guides another one down to third man for a couple and England are struggling to trouble these openers. A wicket is required pretty soon or these two could begin to take the game away from them. From the final delivery Lanning plants her front foot and sweeps one behind square leg, another sweet strike for four.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5th over: Australia 40-0 (Lanning 21, Healy 14)</strong> Danielle Wyatt is brought into the England attack as Brunt is taken off in favour of more spin. A couple of decent looseners for her before one turns down the leg side and that's a wide and a couple of byes. She compensates for that by flighting the next delivery off line on the off side and that is driven well through the covers for four. Charlotte Edwards is beginning to look a little concerned as Wyatt adds another wide onto the extras column. Eight from that over, England struggling.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6th over: Australia 40-0 (Lanning 22, Healy 19)</strong> Anya Shrubsole steaming in now and her first ball is clipped away by Healy for two before Shrubsole drops one short and that is dispatched for four past square leg. There is decent swing to be had out there it seems but at the minute the Australia openers are seeing the white orb like a giant beach ball. Shrubsole is trying to vary up the length but England haven't had a sniff of a wicket so far. Still, at least that's the end of the batting powerplay.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6.4 overs: Australia 51-0 (Lanning 25, Healy 21)</strong> Holly Colvin brought on to try and break up this partnership with more spin. She flights a delightful drifter in and Healy looks to smash it back over her head, but doesn't make decisive contact, only for the ball to fall short of mid-off. Australia are rotating the strike well and using their feet very well to guide the ball down the ground for easy singles.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Australia 51-1 (Lanning c &amp; b Colvin 25)</strong></p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>Just as Lanning was looking set for a decent score, she chips a full ball back into the arms of Colvey who gratefully takes the catch! Jess Cameron next in and after seven overs Australia are 52-1.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8th over: Australia 54-1 (Healy 22, Cameron 2)</strong> Laura Marsh with more slow stuff for England and they have certainly been lifted by that wicket. The match was threatening to drift away from them and the run-rate has been stemmed after two strong overs. Still, they will now target the wicket of Alyssa Healy \u2013 get that and they are really back in the game. Excellent over from Marsh who is getting plenty of spin, the final delivery is a wee bit short and Healy attempts a big heave-ho over square, she doesn't quite connect but it falls just shy of the fielder on the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9th over: Australia 60-1 (Healy 26, Cameron 4)</strong> Holly Colvin continues at the Premadasa Stadium and she has found a good rhythm, coming round the wicket and flighting the ball well. Healy, though, is in really good nick and she dispatches the final two deliveries of the over down the ground for some comfortable runs. That's the key wicket required for England.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>10th over: Australia 68-1 (Healy 26, Cameron 12)</strong> Laura Marsh opens with a sloppy delivery, although Cameron did extremely well to guide it down to the fine leg boundary for four. Charlotte Edwards began to race after the ball, but gave up the ghost as it ran away to the rope. Three dot balls follow and that seems to get to Cameron as she trots down the pitch and smacks one back over Marsh's head for a wonderful four. Eight from the over and Australia in control.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>c</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>That could be the key wicket for England! Healy goes for the big hit through the leg side but completely misses it as Hazell pushes a quicker one on to middle stump!</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11th over: Australia 69-2 (Cameron 13, Sthalekar 1)</strong> That's an important breakthrough for Hazell and only two runs from the over to boot. Sthalekar gets off the mark with a well-taken single but England are certainly back in this one.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12th over: Australia 75-2 (Cameron 16, Sthalekar 3)</strong> Dani Wyatt back into the England attack and they are looking to put pressure on Sthalekar here. She goes for a big hit over mid-wicket but scoops it round to deep square leg, just falling short of Marsh on the boundary. There is plenty of spin to encourage Wyatt but Australia get six from the over, almost all those runs scored through the on side.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>13th over: Australia 85-2 (Cameron 18, Sthalekar 10)</strong> Fantastic shot from Sthalekar! Hazell dropped one in short and gave her space to move her feet and pull one with almighty strength wide of long-on and past deep mid-wicket for a fine four. Australia's run-rate is 6.54 and England will be pleased with stemming the early tide in Colombo. Hazell has bowled her allotted overs and she has done well to give her side a foothold in the match.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>14th over: Australia 92-2 (Cameron 20, Sthalekar 12)</strong> Shrubsole continues for England and Sarah Taylor is standing up to her. An interesting move with Cameron moving across her stumps before every ball. Australia seem content with rotating the strike with singles at the moment, although Cameron attempts a slog on the final delivery, it falls short of deep mid-wicket and another run to the tally.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>15th over: Australia 102-2 (Cameron 28, Sthalekar 13)</strong> Cameron is trying to up the run-rate now with five overs remaining. Marsh back into the attack for England but she's tossing it up mightily high and wide. Her third ball is a nailed on wide and Cameron adds another boundary to the Australia tally, bringing up the 100 with a wonderful reverse-paddle to third man. Excellent shot that and Australia are in the ascendancy once more. Marsh with another terrible full-toss to finish the over, she will be disappointed with that.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>16th over: Australia 119-2 (Cameron 45, Sthalekar 13)</strong> Cameron scores the first six of the innings! Fine shot from her as she dispatches Anya Shrubsole over mid-wicket with consummate ease. Oh dear, Cameron then opens her feet wide and lifts one over the keeper's head for another four! That is a simple majestic shot! And another one follows...Cameron drives through the covers for another boundary! What a terrible over from England's point of view, but credit to Cameron. A wonderful array of strokes there.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Australia 119-3 (Cameron c Gunn b Colvin 45)</strong></p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>Well, it might have come too late for England but this could be another important wicket. Cameron, who has played quite fantastically, goes for the big hit down over long-on but only finds Gunn on the boundary, taking a simple catch.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>17th over: Australia 123-3 (Sthalekar 15, Blackwell 2)</strong> Just four runs and a wicket from Colvin's over, as Alex Blackwell comes to the crease for Australia. Three remaining from England, and they are looking to tie the opposition down and keep them below 150.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>18th over: Australia 130-3 (Sthalekar 16, Blackwell 8)</strong> Danielle Wyatt is brought back into the attack but her first delivery is swept brilliantly behind square for another four, Blackwell notching her first boundary of the innings. Australia's run-rate is 7.22 now and they will be very happy with things at the moment. Sarah Taylor does well to anticipate the reverse sweep from Sthalekar from the final delivery and prevent a certain four.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>19th over: Australia 135-3 (Sthalekar 20, Blackwell 10)</strong> Australia's bowlers and fielders are already limbering up for the second innings in this match. The momentum is certainly with the ladies in yellow and gold and they are looking chirpy and confident. Colvin's penultimate over is only hit for six, though, with some sharp fielding in the deep from England. One more tight over required now.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>19.5 overs: Australia 141-3 (Sthalekar 23, Blackwell 12)</strong> Laura Marsh has the honour of the final over and England are doing well to restrict Australia to singles. Saving these late runs could be crucial at the death in this game. A full toss is batted away but yet again it's straight to a fielder in the deep. Five singles so far...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Australia 142-4 (Blackwell run out Greenway 13)</strong></p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>Australia end their innings with a run-out as Blackwell attempts to come back for a second that was never on, Charlotte Edwards whipping off the bails with time to spare.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Australia 142-4 after 20 overs. England need 143 runs to win.</strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>Well, after starting their innings like a freight train, Australia's intensity dropped off in those last few overs. Still, England are going to need a big effort to chase down 142.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>Here come the teams for the second innings. I reckon this is going to be a tight run thing. England openers are Charlotte Edwards and Laura Marsh.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>Ellyse Perry to open Australia's bowling.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 4-0 (Edwards 4, Marsh 0)</strong> England start with a streaky boundary off the first ball! Perry gets one to swing away from Edwards, but her drive has enough on it to carry past backward point for four. Australia have got two gullies in place and a backward point, packing that offside when Edwards is on strike. Delicious delivery from the penultimate ball, Perry again swinging one away from the England skipper and she's lucky not to get a nick on that. Final ball now and Edwards cracks one to Cameron in the covers, no runs but it smacks the fielder right on the knee. That, will, hurt.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 8-0 (Edwards 4, Marsh 4)</strong> Cameron goes off for some treatment, limping heavily as the substitute fielder comes on. Sthalekar comes into the attack now, a wily spin bowler who is drifting them beautifully into Marsh. She flights one in and Marsh mistimes her shot, there are almighty appeals from behind the stumps but umpire Erasmus says not out, I don't think there was a nick on that, more hopeful than anything that appeal. Can Marsh respond? Yes she can, swatting Sthalekar for four through the leg side. Great shot.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 14-0 (Edwards 10, Marsh 4)</strong> Perry is causing captain Edwards a few problems out there, some decent pace and away swing leaving the England skipper tied up and unable to score freely. Just as I say that Perry drops off her tight line and a straight delivery is clipped expertly through the leg side for four runs. That's more like it from Edwards, but England are certainly not cantering along as Australia were during their batting powerplay.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 18-0 (Edwards 10, Marsh 8)</strong> Laura Marsh gets in on the act as Sthalekar is dispatched with a fine pull through mid-wicket. A couple of bounces and that flies over the boundary rope. Sthalekar changes from round the wicket, to over and back round again. She's changing things up and it's working for Australia. Just four from that over and England may need to crank things up over the next five overs.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 20-1 (Marsh c &amp;b Hunter 8)</strong></p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>Julie Hunter is brought into the attack to immediate effect! Marsh just chips one straight back to the bowler who takes an easy catch. Not what England needed.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 20-1 (Edwards 12, Taylor 1)</strong> Excellent over that from Hunter. Four from it and a crucial wicket. Quiet start from England, 121 required from 90 deliveries. It's starting to look a bit ominous. Sarah Taylor at the crease now.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 34-1 (Edwards 23, Taylor 2)</strong> Erin Osborne brought in by Australia and Taylor goes for a quick single, just making her ground. Edwards back on strike and she smacks Osborne for an almighty six over mid-wicket! Playing with the spin, that's a quite wonderful shot, easily clearing the boundary line. Edwards has the bit between her teeth now and notches another boundary with the penultimate delivery, smacked down the ground \u2013 one bounce and over the line.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 44-1 (Edwards 28, Taylor 7)</strong> Julie Hunter charges in again but flies one down too straight, and with no fine leg in place, Taylor clips one down off her legs for four. Nicely played. England are beginning to pick up the pace and Edwards proceeds to time one expertly through mid-wicket, placed between the despairing fielders and another boundary. 10 from Hunter's over and this is turning into a real contest now.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 44-2 (Edwards c Perry b Sthalekar 28)</strong></p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>That's not what England needed. Edwards, who was looking so comfortably out in the middle, attempts a heave-ho over deep mid-wicket, but there is Perry to pluck a comfortable catch out of the sky.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 46-2 (Taylor 8, Greenway 1)</strong> Lydia Greenway, the left-hander, comes to the crease and gets off the mark with a deft paddle to fine leg. Just three runs from the over and a wicket as well, good work from Sthalekar.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 53-2 (Taylor 12, Greenway 3)</strong> Sarah Taylor drives through the covers, adding a couple to her score before swatting a single to the mid-wicket boundary. That brings up the 50 for England and at the same point Australia were 56-1. Osborne continues to drift them in and Greenway attempts two reverse sweeps in succession, but failing to score of both. Wonderful fielding from Rachael Haynes down at fine leg, Greenway sweeping and Haynes diving to just prevent the four. Taylor drops her bat when scuttling across for a single off the final ball, but just charges back to make her ground.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>9.5 overs: England 61-2 (Taylor 19, Greenway 3)</strong> Perry is brought back into the attack for Australia. This game is finely poised at the moment, Edwards's departure was a real blow for England but with 10 overs remaining there is all to play for. Perry is swinging them in full before trying to surprise Taylor with a bouncer. It doesn't get up on her though and she is able to pull it away for a majestic four.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 61-3 (Taylor c Fields b Perry 19)</strong></p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p>Taylor charges down the wicket and attempts an almighty swipe off a wide-ish delivery, but she edges behind to Fields. England in trouble.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>10.4 overs: England 63-3 (Greenway 4, Brindle 0)</strong> Run-out attempt with Greenway trotting home, a direct hit follows but after a third umpire review, the decision is not out. Jess Jonassen is into the Australia attack with her left-arm spin, and England's boundaries are beginning to dry up.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 63-4 (Greenway c Hunter b Jonassen 4)</strong></p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p>This is beginning to fall apart for England. Greenway goes for the big six over deep mid-wicket only to lift it straight to Hunter for a simple catch. Brindle cuts away the final delivery for four and after 11 overs England are 67-4.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 73-4 (Brindle 6, Wyatt 2)</strong> So, Danielle Wyatt and Aaran Brindle take up the reins for England and they need to produce something special now. Singles aplenty in that over from Osborne, but Wyatt is dicing with death as she chips one just over the bowler's head and out of reach. Six from the over. Required rate for England is 8.75, with 70 runs to win.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 81-4 (Brindle 13, Wyatt 4)</strong> Jonassen continues with her left-arm spin and England, now requiring boundaries, can only paddle and knock quick singles to the fielders in the deep. It's good, quick running from Brindle and Wyatt but they need more than that. Final ball of the over, and it's a dropped catch! Brindle went for the big heave-ho at cow corner and Healy raced over to get hands to it, only to let the ball slip from her grasp and cross the boundary line for four!</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>13.4 overs England 86-4 (Brindle 13, Wyatt 7)</strong> That was a real let off for England. Five wickets down and this game could be over. Sthalekar continues and England just can't seem to up the run-rate.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 86-5 (Brindle b Sthalekar 13)</strong></p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p>That could spell the end for England. I may be speaking prematurely but there are some concerned faces in the dugout as Brindle play's all round Sthalekar's delivery, which rattles into the off stump. <strong>87-5 off 14 overs.</strong></p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 90-6 (Wyatt c Blackwell b Jonassen 9)</strong></p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p>Fantastic diving catch from Blackwell in the covers! Wyatt smashed one low through the off side but going forward, the Australian takes a wonderful catch. That could spell the end for England. <strong>They are 91-6 off 15 overs. 52 required off 30 deliveries.</strong></p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 101-6 (Gunn 10, Brunt 3)</strong> Oh dear! After that wonderful take from Blackwell, she drops an absolute dolly! Woeful from Blackwell following an almighty sky from Gunn, and I don't think the bowler Julie Hunter can quite believe that. England are taking quick runs and doing so extremely well, but they need more than that right now. Penultimate ball of the delivery and it's timed fantastically by Gunn, who pulls it through mid-wicket for four.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 101-7 (Brunt b Jonassen 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>That could be the decisive blow! Brunt attempts a big shot but the fatal sound of bails clattering is all that follows, as she plays all around it.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 108-7 (Gunn 12, Hazell 2)</strong> It's really resting on Gunn's shoulders now. She slams one straight back at the bowler Jonassen, and that jumps out of her hands and safe. That was hit extremely hard and will be extremely painful, a difficult chance.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>17.5 overs: England 120-7 (Gunn 19, Hazell 7)</strong> Glorious shot from Hazell off Hunter, charging down the pitch and lifting one down to the long-off boundary for four. Excellent stuff, but it's too little too late really. She goes big again on the next delivery, but doesn't middle it, adding a streaky single to the total. Gunn on strike now and she also goes big! It's a monster over long-off, this time a six for England.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 120-8 (Gunn c Jonassen b Hunter 19)</strong></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p>Gunn attempts to lift one over fine leg but it's straight at Jonassen, who takes a simple catch.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>England need 23 runs to win off two overs.</strong></p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 127-8 (Hazell 9, Colvin 5)</strong> England rotate the strike with a couple of singles and although they are swinging the bat, it's to no avail at the moment. They need sixes, and fast, but I don't think they are capable of a turnaround. The final ball is dispatched over Perry's head for four by Colvin, perhaps that gives England a glimmer of hope ahead of the last over.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>16 runs to win off the last over</strong></p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>19.1 overs: England 128-8 (Hazell 10, Colvin 5)</strong> Osborne has the honour of Australia's final over, the first ball paddled square on the leg side for a single.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>19.2 overs: England 131-8 (Hazell 10, Colvin 7)</strong> Drama off that delivery! It's a no ball, well above waist height, England run two off it although there was nearly a run-out!</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>19.3 overs: England 132-8 (Hazell 10, Colvin 8)</strong> A full-toss is dropped in the covers and England take a single!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>19.4 overs: England 134-8 (Hazell 12, Colvin 8)</strong> Hazell edges down to third man for two!</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>19.5 overs: England 136-8 (Hazell 14, Colvin 8)</strong> Another misfield from Jonassen in the covers and England take two more.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 137-9 (Colvin run-out 8)</strong></p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>Six required off the last ball...</strong></p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>But Hazell can only send it to the fielder at deep mid-wicket! Australia win by four runs!</strong></p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>AUSTRALIA ARE CHAMPIONS!</strong></p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p>Well you have to say they deserved that, and England did well to take it to the final ball after a slow start.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p>There are tears and celebrations out in the middle. Commiserations for Charlotte Edwards and England, but Australia take a second T20 title.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p>Right, next up is the men's final. Sri Lanka v West Indies coming shortly, and there are clouds gathering in Colombo.</p>",
  "<p>A mother is going to the high court on behalf of her two children to challenge Sir Richard Branson's planned takeover of children's health and social care services in Devon.</p> <p>The action is the first of its kind and raises questions about the way NHS and social services are contracted out to private companies. More than 4,000 children will be affected by the change, many of whom are extremely vulnerable.</p> <p>The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, says her two children, aged nine and 13, both of whom receive treatment for mental health problems, could be adversely affected by the planned takeover by Branson's company Virgin Care.</p> <p>The children have been receiving specialist mental health assistance after being exposed to violence and abuse from their father, who is reported to be drug dependent. The family were forced to escape to safety and the effect on the children has been severe.</p> <p>The mother said: \"This is a dangerous experiment with our children and their future. If children don't get the proper care and support at the time when they need it, it could cause all kinds of problems later on which will be more expensive to sort out.\"</p> <p>Last month Devon county council and Devon primary care trust confirmed they had selected Virgin Care to take over the running of services for children with disabilities, the children's mental health service, and school nurses and health visitors, from 1 April next year. The contract, worth more than \u00a3100m, has not yet been signed. Bids by the NHS and charities with expertise in children's services were rejected. It has not been disclosed what changes, if any, Virgin Care plans to make to the services.</p> <p>The mother's lawyers argue that the council and NHS trust failed to comply with equalities legislation and their own equality policy, including by not conducting an equality impact assessment. They say Virgin Care failed to carry out a timely and comprehensive equality impact assessment. The lawyers are asking the court to declare the decision to give Virgin Care preferred bidder status unlawful.</p> <p>About 27% of children in need in Devon have disabilities, double the national average. There is also a significant Traveller population, and both children and adults in this group experience poorer health than any other group in England.</p> <p>The mother's solicitor, Adam Hundt, at Deighton Pierce Glynn, said the handover of the running of state health and social care services to the private sector was a \"profound development\". Hundt said: \"This involves management changes, transfer of assets from the public to the private sector, and introduction of a profit motive. The impact on accountability is not neutral. Where vulnerable children are involved even greater care must be taken.\"</p> <p>The mother said: \"I am bringing this case because I'm deeply worried that the processes \u2013 meant to ensure people's rights are protected \u2013 have not been followed, and that the people who need most help have not been thought about properly during this process.</p> <p>\"I think it is especially important for these processes to be followed properly where such important services are being taken over by a profit-making company with no experience of providing children's services, which strikes me as inevitably risky.\"</p> <p>Rebecca Harriott, director of commissioning development for NHS Devon, Plymouth and Torbay, said: \"We firmly believe that there is no case to answer and will strongly defend the action. Both authorities are continuing to progress the current process to award a final contract and transfer staff by 31 March 2013.</p> <p>\"The decision to&#xa0;work with&#xa0;Virgin follows an exhaustive tendering process that has involved a large number of parents, carers, professionals and young people themselves as well as affected staff.\"</p> <p>A Virgin Care spokesman said: \"We have a very strong track record of providing NHS care to vulnerable groups including children for many years now., strengthened with extensive expertise through our contract to provide community services in Surrey.\"</p>",

I promise there won't be 'too many tweets...'\".</p> <p>He followed up by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/254642927534493696/photo/1\" title=\"\">posting a photograph</a> of himself meeting staff at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, then fell silent for several hours.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Today I met the nursing team at the John Radcliffe Hospital, and announced \u00a3140m to help their work across the country <a href=\"http://t.co/Ztw8c99N\" title=\"http://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/254642927534493696/photo/1\">twitter.com/David_Cameron/\u2026</a></p> <p>\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/254642927534493696\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-06T18:03:00+00:00\">October 6, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>In the meantime. a torrent of abuse filled his Twitter timeline. Some disgruntled tweeters used it to attack the government's policies. Some expressed their dislike for Cameron in colourful language. Others merely mocked.</p> <p>Political opponents were among those joined the fray. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnprescott\" title=\"\">John Prescott</a>, the former deputy prime minister and a Twitter stalwart, gleefully reposted a series of questions poking fun at Cameron's upper crust background.</p> <p>\"Hi Dave I wonder if you could tell me which wine goes best with roast swan? Cheers,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coolchiccy/status/254642140372684802\" title=\"\">wrote one</a> tweeter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coolchiccy\" title=\"\">Amanda</a>. Another, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RolandMooreTV\" title=\"\">Roland Moore</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RolandMooreTV/status/254647921822289920\" title=\"\">ridiculed Cameron's debut message:</a> \"I promise there won't be 'too many tweets.' &gt; Mind you, you also promised you'd cut the deficit not the NHS.\"</p> <p>Cameron has previously spoken of his reluctance to follow in the footsteps of many other high profile politicians in joining Twitter. Asked about it during a radio interview in 2009, he remarked: \"The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it \u2013 too many tweets might make a twat.\" He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/29/david-cameron-apology-radio-twitter\" title=\"\">later apologised </a>for the comments.</p> <p>While Cameron's presence on Twitter may be a source of annoyance to many, it may be offer some relief to one user. A namesake of the prime minister living in Oregon, who has posted for months as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidcameron\" title=\"\">@davidcameron</a>, is clearly weary of being mistaken for the Tory leader. His Twitter page declares: \"I am NOT the prime minister. I am a dude from America, who is more awesome than the prime minister.\"</p>",
  "<p>Summer is a girl whose parents have split up. Her mother is on a honeymoon with Paddy, Summer's stepfather, so she is staying with her gran. </p> <p>She is trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a ballet dancer by preparing for an important audition. Although her weight is normal, Summer becomes obsessed with being slim and stops eating.</p> <p>I found this book very interesting and I liked the way Cathy Cassidy described Summer's feelings.</p> <p>This book helped me to understand the meaning of anorexia and the effect it has on people, but I found it hard to understand why people would do that to themselves. </p> <p>Summer may have harmed herself by not eating because she came from an emotionally troubled background.</p> <p>My favourite character was Alfie, because he was caring and really wanted to help Summer, even though she made it hard for him. My least favourite character was Summer because I couldn't empathise with her and she got angry with her friends whenever they tried to help her.</p> <p>I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to girls between the ages of 9 and 15 because the characters in the book are around those ages and they may be able to relate to their problems.</p> <p>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</p>",
  "<p>\"Believe me. Believe Philip. Whoever he's Seen is a LON, a Left-Over Nazi. And we'll find him.\"</p> <p>The war has been won, peace has been reached and all is calm in the small seaside town of Norton. People are overjoyed to be living in a time of peace and prosperity. Well, everyone except Lizzie, who's so bored she thinks she's going mad. </p> <p>Until she meets Natalie: dark, wild, dangerous Natalie. Lizzie is drawn to the out-of-control Natalie, and as they grow closer, Natalie reveals something about her strange little brother, Philip: he sees things no one else can, can see that the threat of war is not over. He can see the \"Left-Over Nazis\" and it's up to him and Natalie to find them and force them out of town.</p> <p>To begin with it's all a game to Lizzie, but before long Philip's \"gift\" starts consequences that spin dangerously out of control\u2026</p> <p>I've never read anything by Hendry before, but the moment I read the blurb of The Seeing, I knew I simply had to get my hands on it. It was one of those books you start reading and find you simply cannot put down, no matter how hard you try. It was dark, addictive, seductive and so much more than I ever thought a 170-something paged book could ever be. </p> <p>I don't know if you guys have read it, but something about The Seeing reminded me of The Tulip Touch by Anne Fine. It had the same darkly dangerous feel to it, the same addictiveness. But The Seeing was better in my eyes, much, much better. Incredible, actually, even if the beginning was kinda slow. And, my God, that ending...</p> <p>I must say, Hendry's characterisation was sublime. All the characters were so 3D and intriguing. Lizzie was very much your average teenager, and perfectly embodied how easy it is to get pulled to the 'dark side' by boredom or a need for excitement. Natalie was just\u2026 well, intriguing. Hendry couldn't have written her better if she spent a million years trying. Philip was the most interesting of the lot. There was just something about him. He just knew stuff, stuff he shouldn't \u2013 couldn't \u2013 possibly know. All the way through, I couldn't figure out whether maybe, just maybe, he really did have some kind of \"second sight\"\u2026 Hugo was really sweet and kind; I loved getting an outsider's view of the trio, seeing them all through his eyes. While they were all so well written and padded out, obviously Natalie and Philip stole the show.</p> <p>The writing was just\u2026 whoa. It was atmospheric, creepy and so much darker than I thought it could be. I loved that we got to read from each of the main characters' POVs: it meant we got the whole picture. As for the story line, I was hooked from the prologue. I mean, talk about gripping openings! The plot was fast-paced, thrilling, with the perfect amounts of suspense, description and dramatic pauses. As for the ending\u2026 Just\u2026 whoa\u2026</p> <p>I loved doing post-war Britain in history and have always been fascinated by historical fiction set in that time period. It intrigued me to see the two sides of post-war UK: the rich, prosperous side and the financially struggling, hard-done-by side. The post-war pain and fear and damage was palpable throughout the book, especially whenever Lizzie's mum was involved. </p> <p>The Seeing was like a little time machine back to 1956. I must say, all the themes in this were so much darker than I thought they'd be. One example was the way Natalie and co went about ridding the world of \"LONs\". It was simply bullying, and if there's one thing I truly hate, it's bullying. I actually felt sick to the stomach at some of the things they did\u2026 But that just made the book even better, even more powerful. </p> <p>This book literally blew me away. I can't tell you how powerful and shocking The Seeing was, how addictive it was. As I neared the end, I found myself reading faster and faster and faster, totally hooked, unable to put the book down, not even for a second\u2026 This was such a hard-hitting book, so much so it hurt. Just\u2026 whoa. I really don't know what else I can say. It was just\u2026 beyond explanation. Read it, have your mind blown, and you'll see what I'm talking about.</p> <p>Star Rating:<br>4\u00be Out of 5</p> <p>Read this book if you liked:<br>Tulip Touch by Anne Fine<br>This Is Not Forgiveness by Celia Rees<br>Between Shades of Grey by Ruta Sepetys</p>",
