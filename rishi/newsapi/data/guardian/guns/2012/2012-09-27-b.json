  "<p>City dealers who rig Libor should face criminal charges, the head of the review into reforming the benchmark interest rate will say on Friday as he announces proposals to beef up regulation of the \"broken\" rate-setting system.</p> <p>Martin Wheatley, a senior regulator at the Financial Services Authority, will also stress that other institutions face similar punishments to those handed out to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">Barclays, which was fined \u00a3290m </a>for its attempts to manipulate the rate used to set borrowing costs for companies and households around the world.</p> <p>He will recommend that the FSA should regulate the Libor system. But while he will say that Libor can be preserved, he will also call for an international discussion about alternative benchmarks.</p> <p>Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered rate \u2013 represents the prices banks pay to borrow from each other. It is set by a panel of banks asked the prices at which they expect to borrow over 15 periods, from overnight to 12 months, in 10 currencies. The rates the banks submit are published on the same day.</p> <p>Wheatley is proposing that those 150 benchmark rates be reduced to just 20 \u2013 in five currencies and four maturities. He says more banks should participate in making submissions \u2013 but he is proposing that the individual rates submitted should not be published for three months, to avoid a rerun of 2008 when, at the height of the banking crisis, rates were artificially reduced to avoid any stigma of appearing to be in trouble. The managers of the so-called submitters should be subjected to direct authorisation by the FSA, he will say, and a code of conduct drawn up for the operation of the rates.</p> <p>His hasty six-week review was sparked by the Barclays scandal which eventually led to the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. The firms involved in Libor were regulated but not the market itself, so he will call for the law to be changed to make it offence to \"make a false or misleading statement\" to manipulate Libor.</p> <p>\"This would enable the FSA to use criminal powers for the worst cases of attempted manipulation,\" Wheatley will tell a City audience as he publishes his review.</p> <p>Wheatley, who is to head the Financial Conduct Authority when it is spun out of the FSA next year, will also attack the previous \"careless\" way in which the rate-setting process was overseen by the British Bankers' Association, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/25/bba-libor-setting-role-stripped-banks\" title=\"\">will be stripped of any further involvement</a>. A tender process will be started on Friday for a new body to oversee Libor in a process that will be supervised by Baroness Hogg . He will call on the banks involved to \"stand up and take responsibility\" too.</p> <p>\"The reason we are here \u2026 is that we have been misled. The system is broken and needs a complete overhaul. The disturbing events we have uncovered in the manipulation of Libor have severely damaged our confidence and our trust \u2013 it has torn the very fabric that our financial system is built on,\" Wheatley will say.</p> <p>\"Governance of Libor has completely failed, resulting in the sort of shameful behaviour that we have seen. This problem has been exacerbated by a lack of regulation and a comprehensive mechanism to punish those who manipulate the system.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have allowed successive welfare-to-work schemes worth nearly \u00a31bn to remain open to possible fraud by private companies, a powerful committee of MPs has said.</p> <p>The Commons public accounts committee said the Department for Work and Pensions failed to ensure that employees of such firms do not defraud the public purse while claiming to place unemployed people into work.</p> <p>In a report on Friday, MPs also found the government has been unable to ensure that the latest welfare-to-work scheme, the work programme, is entirely free from fraud despite fresh safeguards.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair and MP for Barking, said arrangements for overseeing and inspecting contractors were so weak that vital evidence on potential fraud and improper practice was not picked up.</p> <p>\"The department failed to obtain from A4e damning internal audit reports produced in 2009 which pointed to instances of potential fraud and malpractice across the country,\" she said.</p> <p>The 34-page internal audit identified dozens of incidents of potential fraud, reputational risk or suspected rule breaking by staff in at least 12 of the company's offices where public money was claimed for placing long-term unemployed people into work.</p> <p>In one paragraph, auditors said the number of damaging incidents was so large that the company was open to claims of a \"systematic failure\" to stop the risks of fraud.</p> <p>Hodge said: the department had been forced to follow up allegations brought to the committee's attention after MPs heard evidence from whistleblowers who alleged that private companies were at the centre of fraudulent activity.</p> <p>\"If it had not been for whistleblowers, a range of systemic issues would not have been identified. The department might have identified these issues if it had asked the right questions of providers,\" she said.</p> <p>In the specific case of A4e, whose former head Emma Harrison was a close adviser to David Cameron, the department has yet to assess if the company is \"fit and proper\" to be paid millions in public money, MPs said.</p> <p>Eight people have been arrested at the company over allegations of fraud relating to offices in Slough, Berkshire.</p> <p>Richard Bacon, the Conservative MP for South Norfolk and a committee member, said the DWP adopted a \"black box\" approach to the work programme, focusing on results without taking proper interest in how they were achieved.</p> <p>\"It's hardly surprising that this vague and hazy approach to financial control and oversight has produced so many questions over proper governance, audit and transparency,\" he said.</p> <p>The report follows a serious of fractious committee meetings to discuss the problems of possible fraud in the sector.</p> <p>Some MPs on the committee are privately angry that the report has been watered down by Conservative members who do not wish to criticise a scheme crucial to government policy.</p> <p>The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said in a statement that he had been so concerned about the problems he had written to former Labour ministers \u2013 including Hodge \u2013 for permission to release papers from their time in office relating to the fraud allegations.</p> <p>\"No such permission has been granted; indeed, some have not replied at all,\" he said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for A4e said that the DWP has identified no evidence of fraud, systemic or otherwise, in relation to any audit of the contracts held with A4e.</p> <p>\"A4e is a different company from the one it was two years ago,\" she said. \"Together with the findings of audits earlier this year by the DWP and the Skills Funding Agency, and with further reviews by the Welsh and Northern Ireland governments, A4e's business has been thoroughly and extensively examined by external auditors.\"</p>",
  "<p>Justin Rose has said the possibility of maintaining a British sporting feelgood factor will provide him with extra Ryder Cup motivation.</p> <p>The success of the London Olympics, added to Andy Murray's win at the US Open, has ensured a positive atmosphere around Britain's sport scene. Rose, Luke Donald, Paul Lawrie, Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter form the British contingent in Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal's Ryder Cup side.</p> <p>\"That's one thing I was thinking at the World Golf Championship event at Akron: 'What if I pull out and was there to see the end of the Olympics?'\" Rose said. \"What an amazing experience to be in that stadium for that final night or those nights when Mo Farah was winning and all those gold medals were coming in.</p> <p>\"I've heard so many great comments about how great London did at hosting the Olympics. There's a huge feelgood factor kept going by Andy Murray, so lets hope we can keep it going even further. We all feel that. Normally if you win the Ryder Cup you get to go to the Sports Personality of the Year show as top dogs. This time we'd just been one of a crowd.\"</p> <p>Rose represents one of a clutch of European players who are based in the United States. \"That's why Twitter is actually really helpful,\" he said. \"I get a lot of tweets and a lot of encouragement, particularly around the majors. People say: 'I've had 20 quid on you,' and you know they are coming from England or Britain.</p> <p>\"I definitely feel connected from that point of view. A lot of us are living out here now and you really have to keep that connection. We have been treated so well by the English fans over the years, they've been big supporters of mine. I love going back; I don't get back very often but I haven't lost the identity.\"</p> <p>Amid wave after wave of talk about the likelihood of a boisterous atmosphere at Medinah, Rose's calm persona stands out. The world No5 says his nature should not be misinterpreted as identifying a lack of fight. \"I've got a fire that goes deep within,\" Rose said. \"You just have to ask caddies of mine I've had over the years. I struggle to control that fire at times. I think that's what you need as well, though.</p> <p>\"I don't know how to explain it but I wake up motivated every day and get better and work hard. Sometimes I get in my own way as I'm a perfectionist and have had to learn to let things go.\"</p> <p>Yet Rose's on-course nature is in contrast to the extroverted Ian Poulter, with whom he has forged a formidable partnership. \"Going back to the days on the Challenge Tour, I think we were good for each other,\" Rose said. \"I think we learned a lot from each other. I learned how he carried himself from a confidence point of view, when I was lacking in self-belief and he learned a lot from me in terms of my work ethic and how I go about things.</p> <p>\"We've definitely been a good mix for each other over the years. We're super-competitive with each other, too. Back at Lake Nona we'll have a chipping completion and we both hate to lose. We have a great relationship but we have a great rivalry. It's just a good dynamic between us, a lot of banter. The caddies, too, those boys go back as friends to their days on the ladies' tour.</p> <p>\"We have the relationship where if one of us makes a mistake we're not saying sorry. We feel comfortable in each other's presence to give each other a pep talk and say: 'C'mon mate, pull your finger out.' If you are playing with someone you don't quite know it's almost as if you are letting him down at times if you are struggling. Me and Poults don't have that.\"</p> <p>Rose has featured only in a single Ryder Cup, winning three points from a possible four when Europe were beaten in Valhalla, Kentucky, four years ago. \"I can't imagine what it will be like to win the Ryder Cup,\" he said. \"My week at Valhalla was such a great week. I was on a losing team but I still had a fantastic time. It was disappointing not to win it but from a personal achievement and experience point of view it was amazing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Always ballsy, often brilliant, sometimes exasperating, John Cassavetes' 1970 picture Husbands is now on rerelease. Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara and Cassavetes himself play Archie, Harry and Gus respectively, three middle-aged married friends who experience a&#xa0;kind of three-way midlife breakdown when their best buddy dies. A brilliant opening sequence of still shots shows the four musketeers goofing around by&#xa0;the pool with their wives and kids, flexing their muscles, Mr Universe-style, an ironic demonstration of power and strength. After the funeral, they go on a monumental 48-hour drinking spree in Manhattan to anaesthetise their grief and fear. After Harry has a fight with his wife and mother-in-law on returning home still drunk, the three then head off for an impulsive break in&#xa0;London \u2013 of all the dreary and unpromising places. This is so they can&#xa0;\u2026 what? Have a rest? Have the last bachelor party before the grave? Perhaps nothing in the movie matches the opening 20 minutes in Manhattan, when the guys begin drinking and, like&#xa0;John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom, play a little consolatory basketball. Some scenes are outrageously extended, with some hardcore improv material and head-butting male display, and there is a whole lot of Acting with a capital A. The scenes in&#xa0;which the guys hang out in hotel rooms with the British women they have picked up are almost exotically contrived, like a trip to another planet, but with the snappiest of lines. \"Diana and I were just discussing \u2026\" says Harry, blearily tailing off. \"Disgusting?\" interrupts Archie drolly. \"\u2026 <em>discussing</em> how amazing the world is!\" What texture and flavour this movie has. Cassavetes' film-making style seems as&#xa0;alien to modern Hollywood as&#xa0;silent cinema. The director's own heyday coincided with the arrival of younger New Yorkers Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen; Cassavetes died in 1989 at the age of 60. If he were still alive, might he be making movies such&#xa0;as Hugo and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/13/to-rome-with-love-review\" title=\"\">To Rome With Love</a>? Who knows?

  "<p>Touring his legendary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/15/van-morrison-astral-weeks-live\" title=\"\">Astral Weeks</a> album appears to have rejuvenated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/van-morrison?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Van Morrison</a>. His 35th solo studio album is his jazziest: the warm brass and catchy, sweet melodies recall 1970's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lFxGBB4UGU\" title=\"\">Moondance</a>. But the music's velvet glove delivers some of his hardest-hitting lyrics. With the global economic meltdown providing inspiration, End of the Rainbow finds him rueing capitalism, materialism and social climbing. Educating Archie lines up targets like ducks: \"global elites\", \"slavery to capitalism\", control by media and \u2013 most wonderfully \u2013 \"entertainment on TV and all kinds o' shite!\" Morrison is famously curmudgeonly, and there's more black humour in the sublime <a href=\"http://www.jazzfm.com/2012/09/world-exclusive-van-morrison/\" title=\"\">Goin' Down to Monte Carlo</a>. Like a Belfast Mark E Smith, he flees Sartre's \"hell\" of other people only to find himself bombarded by \"some kind of phoney pseudo-jazz!\" Elsewhere, his moods swing like the rhythm section. Open the Door is warm and friendly, Pagan Heart a Doorsy blues. Of all the songs here, If in Money We Trust \u2013 a mantra-like rumination on the love of Mammon over God \u2013 most deserves to join his pantheon of classics.</p>",
  "<p>It's easy to see why Flying Lotus has built up such a high-profile following: Erykah Badu and Thom Yorke, who both guest on the LA producer's fourth album, are long-time devotees; Venus Williams, who does not, celebrated her Wimbledon doubles title this year by going raving in East London with him. Until the Quiet Comes is packed full of ideas. Among the most beguiling are the shimmering funk of The Nightcaller \u2013 percussion rustling through an undergrowth of squelching bass and gently murmured vocals \u2013 and the wind-up toy melody underpinning Putty Boy Strut. Badu's contribution to See Thru to U is casual and abstracted, but no less gorgeous for that, while FlyLo's jazz background is filtered through curious found sounds on the title track. But FlyLo's albums tend to be slight, and this is no exception: these tracks feel less like fully fleshed-out compositions than lightly drawn sketches started, but not always finished, from a spontaneous jam session.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama called for a new era of \"economic patriotism\" as he launched a fresh series of attacks on Mitt Romney for his comments disparaging 47% of Americans as freeloaders.</p> <p>As the first votes were cast in the White House election, Obama placed the 47% remarks at the heart of his campaign, telling supporters in Virginia that change in cannot be achieved in one term and \"it can't happen if you write off half the nation before you take office\". </p> <p>Romney's comments were caught on a secretly recorded video when the Republican presidential candidate addressed a small group of wealthy donors in May.</p> <p>The attack was reinforced in new ads released Thursday. In one, Romney's voice is heard dismissing the 47% of the population who he said are dependent on the government and take no responsibility for their own lives. On screen, as Romney speaks, are pictures of the groups the Democrats suggest he was referring to: the elderly, veterans, Latinos, children and working-class women.</p> <p>It is a potent election message, and Romney's remarks are proving to be one of the most destructive moments of the whole White House campaign.</p> <p>Another Obama ad deals with \"economic patriotism\", a new label for the president's economic promises, which include creating 1m manufacturing jobs and hiring thousands of new teachers.</p> <p>They are to be broadcast in seven swing states: Virginia, Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada. But they are not being shown in North Carolina, a sign that the Obama campaign may have written the state off as a gain for Romney. </p> <p>The \"economic patriotism\" promotes economic growth from the bottom up and contrasts this with Romney's trickle-down approach.</p> <p>\"This country doesn't succeed when only the rich get richer,\" Obama said in his speech. \"We succeed when the middle class gets bigger, when there are ladders of opportunity for all who strive to get into the middle class, when everybody who's willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead and live up to their God-given potential.\"</p> <p>Then, turning directly to the secret video, Obama added: \"I don't think we can get very far with leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims who never take responsibility for their own lives.\"</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney were campaigning in Virginia on Thursday in areas with a strong military presence. The president was in Virginia Beach while Romney was in Springfield.</p> <p>Obama opted for a broad appeal to voters while Romney flailed about in the wake of disastrous poll figures showing him badly trailing the president in swing states. Obama is ahead in Virginia in spite of predictions he would not be able to hold it after his 2008 win.</p> <p>Early voting began in Iowa on Thursday and starts in Ohio next week and elsewhere round the country. An estimated 30%-40% of those voting will have cast their ballots before election day November 6.</p> <p>In his speech, Obama, echoing Romney's secret video, said that wherever he visited in America, including Virginia, he did not find victims as Romney contended but hardworking Americans.</p> <p>\"I see students trying to work their way through college. I see single moms, like my mom, putting in overtime to raise their kids right. I see senior citizens who have been saving for retirement your entire lives,\" Obama said. \"I see a whole bunch of veterans who served this country with bravery and distinction.\"</p> <p>In what could be a rehearsal for the first presidential debate in Denver on Wednesday, he noted that Romney had picked up on a comment he had made that change in Washington does not come from the inside and that change in Washington had to come the outside.</p> <p>\"And for some reason, this got governor Romney really excited. And he rewrote his speech, and he stood up at a rally and he proudly declared: 'I'll get the job done from the inside' \u2013 which got me thinking, what kind of inside job are you talking about?,\" Obama said, proving that not only does he have better delivery than Romney, he has better speech-writers.</p> <p>As the laughter subsided, Obama continued: \"Because if it's the inside job of rubber-stamping the top-down, lobbyist-driven agenda of this Republican Congress, we don't want that. If it's the inside job of letting oil companies write energy policy, insurance companies writing health care policy, outsourcers writing our tax code, we don't need that. If it's the inside job of trying to control the health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves, we'll take a pass on that. We don't need an inside job.\"</p> <p>He added, ramming home his point about Romney's speech: \"In 2008, 47% of this country did not vote for me. But the night of the election, I said to all those Americans, I said, I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voice. I need your help. I will be your president, too.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/22/looper-director-rian-johnson\" title=\"\">Rian Johnson</a>'s Looper is very exciting and very confusing at the same time: a&#xa0;gripping time-travel, sci-fi thriller indebted to Christopher Nolan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/85683/memento\" title=\"\">Memento</a> and James Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/88018/terminator\" title=\"\">The&#xa0;Terminator</a>, but with its own creepiness and muscular sense of urgency. Bewilderingly, the film is set in the future, in 2044, and also 30 years further ahead than that. In 2074, time travel is invented, and at once made illegal by a nervous government; at the same time, surveillance technology and CSI-style forensic skills make killing people very difficult, so crime syndicates get hold of a samizdat time-travel device and use this to \"remove\" troublesome people. Victims are whooshed back in time 30 years where&#xa0;lowly paid assassins blast them&#xa0;with shotguns and get paid in silver bars strapped to the victim's body. But there's a catch. The killers are known as \"loopers\", because one day they must close the loop. Their future middle-aged selves must be liquidated, because they have amassed too much information about their employer, so are sent back in time for&#xa0;assassination with the special retirement payoff of gold bars strapped on. The younger self&#xa0;must then pull the trigger, and accept, with as much zen calm as possible, his disappearance in 30 years. One of these loopers is Joe, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt <em>(above)</em> \u2013 but when his older self, played by Bruce Willis, comes back, he somehow evades the execution and Joe has to hunt himself down.</p> <p>As with all time-travel movies, there&#xa0;is an awkward moment when one&#xa0;character asks plaintively about the logical impossibilities inherent in&#xa0;what's happening and another character tells him to just shut up and forget about it. Of course, there is no sense in the time travel in Looper, but no less sense than in any other film in this genre. Johnson makes up for it with narrative force, mesmeric fascination and a sense of a profound taboo being broken. Gordon-Levitt is made up oddly \u2013 to look like Willis's younger self, of course, but this has an uncanny effect, adding to the mutant strangeness that pervades the movie. It's different from the comedy in Robert Zemeckis's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78042/back-to-the-future\" title=\"\">Back to the Future</a> (1985) and the deadpan science in Shane Carruth's cult indie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101906/primer\" title=\"\">Primer</a> (2004). There is violence and fear: criminals have corrupted the very&#xa0;tenets of space and time. Jeff&#xa0;Daniels has a funny cameo as Abe,&#xa0;the gang boss who has to make excursions back in time to check this side of the operation is running smoothly. He is contemptuous of Joe taking French lessons and tells him to learn Mandarin&#xa0;because China is going to be all-important. (\"I'm from the future; I&#xa0;know.\") I left Looper dizzy with excitement, and also just dizzy.</p>",
  "<p>John Terry is eager to clear his name after he was found guilty of racially abusing the Queen Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand but the Chelsea captain will await the Football Association's written judgment before deciding whether to appeal against the four-match ban and \u00a3220,000 fine he was given on Thursday.</p> <p>An independent regulatory commission delivered its verdict after a four-day hearing in relation to the incident at Loftus Road last October, which led to Terry&#xa0;being charged with a racially aggravated public order offence after he was alleged to have called Ferdinand \"a fucking black cunt\".</p> <p>Terry denied the charge, arguing he was repeating the words Ferdinand accused him of saying rather than using them as an insult, and was subsequently cleared at Westminster magistrates court in July. The FA's own investigation, however, has arrived at a different outcome, leaving Terry, who announced his retirement from international football on the eve of the hearing, with a stain against his name unless he can successfully appeal.</p> <p>The exact reasons why Terry was found guilty of \"using abusive language\" towards Ferdinand which \"included a reference to colour and/or race\", and why the ban is four games fewer than the eight-match ban Luis Su\u00e1rez received for racially abusing Patrice Evra last year, will not become clear until the report is released. That could be early next week, after which Terry will have 14 days to decide whether to lodge an appeal.</p> <p>In the meantime Terry is free to carry on playing for Chelsea, starting with Saturday's Premier League match at Arsenal, when he is expected to lead the side out after completing his first full training session of the week at Cobham on Friday. An FA statement said: \"The penalty is suspended until after the outcome of any appeal, or the time for appealing expires, or should Mr Terry decide not to appeal.\"</p> <p>Given the stance that Terry has adopted up until now, it would be a surprise if he backed down and accepted the charge. A statement issued by Terry's management company said: \"Mr Terry is disappointed that the FA regulatory commission has reached a different conclusion to the clear not guilty verdict of a court of law. He has asked for the detailed written reasons of the decision and will consider them carefully before deciding whether to lodge an appeal.\"</p> <p>Although the FA's regulations state that an FA appeal board decision is final and binding, that may not preclude Terry from going straight to the court of arbitration for sport and seeking clarification as to whether Cas could have jurisdiction to rule on the case. The first step, however, would be an FA appeal, which could potentially take place during the international break next month.</p> <p>Terry's legal team, led by George Carter-Stephenson QC, had felt that the 31-year-old's acquittal in court in the summer would work in their favour, but the standard of proof was lower in the FA's investigation, where the four-man panel were working on \"the balance of probabilities\", rather than \"beyond reasonable doubt\", to establish if an offence had been&#xa0;committed.</p> <p>Chelsea, who have a zero tolerance policy towards racism, issued a brief statement on the back of the verdict. \"Chelsea Football Club notes and respects today's decision by the Football Association regarding John Terry. We also recognise that John has the right to appeal that decision. It is therefore inappropriate for us to comment further on the matter at this time.\"</p> <p>Joey Barton, who was given a 12-match ban after he was found guilty of two charges of violent conduct following his dismissal at Manchester City on the final day of last season, poured scorn on the punishment handed out to Terry. The Marseille midfielder tweeted: \"4 games? A years worth of investigation, a four day FA hearing and only a 4 game ban? Suarez got 8 didn't he? WTF's going on... Well I think that proves a lot. What an absolute farce. 12 games for violent conduct and only 4 for that. FA should be embarrassed. By the FA's perverse reckoning, I'd have got less of a ban for racially abusing the Man City players than tickling them as I did.\"</p>",
  "<p>An 83-year-old marriage equality campaigner was at New York's federal appeals court on Thursday for the latest stage of her fight against a federal act that defines marriage as between a man and a woman.</p> <p>Lawyers for Edith Windsor argued that her marriage to Thea Spyer, in 2007, should offer the same federal rights as a union between a man and a woman.</p> <p>Windsor's legal team say the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) discriminates against her and others by limiting marriage to heterosexual couples. Thursday's hearing was the latest in many legal battles for same-sex equality across the United States; supporters ultimately hope a supreme court ruling will overturn the law.</p> <p>Windsor, a former IT worker, met Spyer in 1965. They became engaged in 1967 and finally married in Toronto in 2007. Spyer died in 2009 after battling multiple sclerosis for many years, but, unlike opposite-sex married couples, Windsor was not entitled to any tax relief on her inheritance. Windsor had to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes.</p> <p>\"The Defense of Marriage act discriminates against gay people,\" she said outside New York's second circuit court of appeals. \"Not only is it illegal, as my lawyers argued today, but it refutes, it really challenges the basic principles on which this country was founded: fairness and equality.\"</p> <p>Windsor and her supporters say current federal law violates the 14th amendment of the US constitution, which guarantees equal protection under the law. The Obama administration said in 2011 it considered Doma unconstitutional and would no longer defend it.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union filed the case on behalf of Windsor earlier this year, and in June a federal district judge in New York ruled in her favour. But House speaker John Boehner convened what became known as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group to defend Doma in court after Obama withdrew his administration's support. Boehner's group appealed the district judge's verdict on Windsor, prompting Thursday's hearing.</p> <p>The second circuit court expedited the case due to Windsor's age and poor health \u2013 she told the Guardian she had \"a number of major illnesses\" \u2013 while Windsor has also asked the supreme court to review her case. Federal courts in Massachusetts, California and Connecticut have previously found the law unconstitutional, and those cases are pending before the supreme court, which has until Monday to decide whether to take up the issue in its next term.</p> <p>\"In the last few years virtually every case that has addressed the issue has struck down Doma,\" said Windsor's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan. She said she was confident the judges would find in Windsor's favour but would not be drawn on how long that might take.</p> <p>The justice department has filed petitions in all four cases, asking the high court to review the constitutionality of the law's definition of marriage. A lawyer for the department was in court on Thursday, essentially providing evidence in support of Windsor's case.</p> <p>Also present in the packed courtroom were various supporters of Windsor, some of whom were embroiled in their own legal battles elsewhere. Joanne Pederson, <a href=\"https://www.glad.org/doma/plaintiffs-pedersen/#plaintiff_1166\">who is bringing her own Doma challenge in Connecticut</a>, was in court with her wife, Ann Meitzen, to \"show our support for Edie\".</p> <p>Pederson, who held a civilian position in the US navy for 30 years, says she cannot add Meitzen, who has health problems, to her health insurance plan because of Doma. \"Just because we're a same-sex couple, it shouldn't mean we don't receive life benefits,\" she said.</p> <p>It is likely to be several weeks before a ruling on Windsor's case in the second circuit court.

  "<p>In simultaneously seeking to assert a classically Liberal identity for his party while pledging his continued allegiance to the coalition project, Nick Clegg unwittingly exposes the fundamental delusion that underpins Liberal Democrat thinking: the fantasy that a compassionate and enabling social order can be built on the foundations of long-discredited rightwing economics.</p> <p>The Liberal ideal of freedom is a fine thing for those who have it. For the rest of us to come within shouting distance of such freedom \u2013 to move beyond Clegg's limp \"freedom to be who you are\" to the opportunity to become who we might be \u2013 requires not more Orange Book laissez-faire and privatisation, but a government prepared to wrest back control from the markets and the rent-seekers, to assert and convince the electorate of government's legitimate rights and obligations in such areas as education, healthcare, welfare and investment in and oversight of what used to be called the commanding heights of the economy.</p> <p>Given the overwhelming evidence of the failure of the market project of the last 30 years, it shouldn't be that hard, but clearly someone like Clegg, who cannot make the most basic connection between an abstract concept of freedom and the policies needed actually to achieve it on behalf of the majority, can never be part of the programme.</p> <p>In 1821 Liberal basically meant not Tory; if it means anything at all today, it means more or less Tory.<br><strong>Root Cartwright</strong><br><em>Radlett, Hertfordshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 Nick Clegg's was almost the worst leader's speech I have heard in nearly 50 years of listening to Liberal and Liberal Democrat leaders.

To call Jo Grimond in evidence was a disgrace. Clegg's gunfire is turned on his party.<br><strong>Tony Greaves</strong><br><em>Lib Dem, House of Lords </em></p> <p>\u2022 I have been a member of a joint Labour-Lib Dem administration on Berkshire county council and before the 1997 election ran an organisation called Linc (Labour initiative on co-operation) set up to promote co-operation nationally between Labour and the Lib Dems. I wrote a pamphlet called What's the Beef?, showing that there was, then, a high degree of overlap between the two parties' policies.</p> <p>But I have to say that today, all the Lib Dem MPs, including those who appeared on Linc platforms, having trooped loyally through the lobbies since May 2010 to support Michael Gove's dismantling the principle of local democratic responsibility for education which dates back to 1870, Andrew Lansley's determination to hand the NHS over to the private sector, and Iain Duncan-Smith's plans that will make tens of thousands of families homeless and destroy the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of disabled people, I have to question whether any of those MPs are properly described as part of a \"progressive majority\" (Martin Kettle, Guardian, 27 September).</p> <p>The challenge after the 2015 general election will be, rather like that after 1945, to build, on the wreckage the Tories have left and, in a period of austerity, a new welfare state fit for our times.&#xa0;That's a task for real progressives, not people emerging from five years self-imposed exile on Planet Osborne and pleading for a second chance.<br><strong>Pete Ruhemann</strong><br><em>Reading</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee's mocking comment (27 September) that Clegg reprised his \"scare-mongering Greek comparisons\" speech at conference, seems to have backfired on her quite spectacularly.

Or does Ms Toynbee still believe such a financial meltdown couldn't have happened here,&#xa0; especially if the sainted Ed Balls were chancellor?

  "<p>As directing partners who happen also to be married, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are doubly anomalous. Their comedy-dramas \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114024/little.miss.sunshine\" title=\"\">Little Miss Sunshine</a>, which inspired <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-starts-cool-note-128435\" title=\"\">a Sundance bidding war</a> and <a href=\"http://film.guardian.co.uk/oscars2007/0,,1986215,00.html\" title=\"\">won two Oscars</a>, and the new Ruby Sparks, a bizarre psychological love story \u2013 are searching, compassionate and zesty. Judging by the hour I spend with them, their relationship is no less stimulating. They welcome me into their hotel room with a merry babble of overlapping greetings. They don't so much finish each other's sentences as nip in and out of them, supplying any just-out-of-reach words or asides as though passing the condiments across the dinner table.</p> <p>In his straw Panama hat, striped shirt and navy tank-top, Dayton, who is 55, looks like a bearded, bespectacled owl who became a west coast literature professor. Faris, two years younger, wears a sky-blue shirt and a nest of tousled auburn hair. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000837/\" title=\"\">Bob Balaban</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001416/\" title=\"\">Catherine Keener</a> could play them without any time in the makeup chair.</p> <p>For such an upbeat couple, they have made a relationship movie that is frequently uncomfortable. Ruby Sparks stars <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/20/paul-dano-like-idea-consequence\" title=\"\">Paul Dano, the stubbornly mute son from Little Miss Sunshine</a>, as Calvin, a blocked novelist unable to follow up his generation-defining first novel. Until, that is, he produces an idealised heroine; her name, Ruby Sparks, is surely a nod to Muriel Spark, whose novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/jul/18/the-comforters-muriel-spark\" title=\"\">The Comforters</a> is about a woman who realises she is a character in a book.</p> <p>Ruby, played by the film's screenwriter Zoe Kazan, comes to life, and Calvin discovers he can modify her characteristics \u2013 make her fluent in French, or pathetically dependent on him \u2013 simply by setting them down on paper. It's a horror film in hipsters' clothing. \"Someone described it as <a href=\"http://movies.yahoo.com/news/ruby-sparks-review-cute-becomes-cutesy-113041102.html\" title=\"\">Annie Hall meets Frankenstein</a>,\" notes Dayton approvingly. \"We felt if we played it as truthfully as possible,\" adds Faris. \"We could lay the groundwork for the strange places it ends up going.\" These include a gruelling climax in which Calvin demonstrates the chilling extent of his control over Ruby.</p> <p>As veteran commercials directors whose production company <a href=\"http://www.bobcentral.com/\" title=\"\">Bob Industries </a>counts Gap, Apple and Sony PlayStation among its clients, Dayton and Faris maintain a special interest in the marketing of their films. \"Ruby Sparks has been sold like a romcom in the States,\" says Faris. \"But we never saw it like that. We were more interested in exploring that desire to corral your partner into being who you want them to be, rather than who they are. It's the same with work: if you control something too much, you can suck the life out of it.\"</p> <p>Ruby Sparks is an almost absurdly fitting project for the pair, and not only because the task of balancing the wistful with the warped is well within their skill-set. It's also a film in which the division between life and art is elided, as it must be in the directors' own world. \"I like being able to talk about work while we're making dinner,\" says Faris. \"I'd rather discuss it at that moment while it's fresh.\" When their teenage children were younger, they would mistake their parents' passionate discussions for arguments, crying: \"Don't fight! Don't fight!\" \"I'd tell them, 'Mummy and Daddy aren't fighting \u2013 we're working.'\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396797464\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348761102376/ruby-sparks-with-Paul-Dan-008.jpg\" alt=\"ruby sparks with Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Annie Hall meets Frankenstein' ...

They began making documentaries together, and emerged fortuitously from film school just as the music video era was dawning. \"There was this urgent need for new film-makers. There wasn't a lot of money in it, but we didn't need much.\" The couple directed music promos, as well as The Cutting Edge, an MTV show with a DIY aesthetic.</p> <p>They worked together for six years without so much as playing footsie. \"My girlfriends always got jealous,\" recalls Dayton. Once the footsie finally kicked off, they kept it a secret for a year, wary of external pressure. \"Even our crew didn't know,\" Faris smiles. But they reckoned without the twitching antennae of David Lynch. \"We were interviewing David, and between takes he said, 'So, are you guys married?' We told him we weren't, then he asked, 'Well, are you gonna get married?' I think we both blushed. So it's down to&#xa0;him that everyone found out.\"</p> <p>Marriage didn't alter work, they say, but having children did. The dreaded pram in the hallway turned out, on closer inspection, to be a springboard. \"We were a little lazy before that and it focused us,\" says Dayton. \"We did all our best work after the children were born.\" That includes many inventive, award-winning videos. For <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrwjiO1MCVs\" title=\"\">\"Been Caught Stealing\" by Jane's Addiction</a>, they shot a cross-dressing shoplifting spree with a fish-eye lens; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOG3eus4ZSo\" title=\"\">\"Tonight, Tonight\" by The Smashing Pumpkins</a> occasioned a haunted homage to M\u00e9li\u00e8s. Red Hot Chili Peppers, REM, Oasis, Janet Jackson \u2013 everyone wanted them.</p> <p>The pair took their time looking for the right movie project. They turned down <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96432/bad-boys-ii\" title=\"\">Bad Boys II</a> but seized on Michael Arndt's screenplay Little Miss Sunshine, a bittersweet comedy about a failed motivational speaker taking his largely unhappy family on a road trip to a child beauty contest. Even that was five years in the making. \"The studio, Focus Features, didn't understand what we wanted to make and we didn't want to make what they had in mind,\" sighs Faris. \"They weren't interested in ensembles because \u2013\"</p> <p>\" \u2013 they wanted a star for the poster,\" continues Dayton, \"which is ironic \u2013\"</p> <p>\" \u2013 because by the time it opened, Steve Carell, who was in the movie, was that star.\"</p> <p>Focus was among the studios bidding for the movie at Sundance in 2006, but Fox Searchlight bought it for $10m, a staggering amount for an independent production. After its runaway success (<a href=\"http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=littlemisssunshine.htm\" title=\"\">the $8m movie grossed more than $100m worldwide</a>), the directors were inundated with poor scripts and dubious advice. \"We were at an actual, cliched Hollywood party,\" recalls Dayton, \"and a major studio executive said to us: 'Whatever you do, you've got to make another movie soon. You can make three bad ones and it won't hurt you: just don't wait.' We heard that from Spielberg too, didn't we?\"</p> <p>Faris furrows her brow. \"Really?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. He told us: 'You've gotta make another movie before \u2026'\" Dayton trails off, leaving room for Faris to introduce a faint note of scepticism: \"Hmm. I don't remember that.\"</p> <p>The tip fell on deaf ears, anyway. They weren't about to rush into anything that didn't feel exactly right. Among the numerous projects that almost came off was Used Guys, a comedy set in a female-governed world where cloned men are traded like cars; the budget was so big they feared they would be overruled by the studio on every decision.</p> <p>Nothing clicked until Ruby Sparks. Did the idea of an artist struggling to follow up a hit debut ring some bells for them? \"We did find it funny that we, of all people, would be making that,\" Dayton laughs. But the marketplace to which they have brought the new film is a more desolate and desperate one. The press kit for Ruby Sparks claims that Little Miss Sunshine \"redefined independent cinema\". Dayton grimaces, and argues that any ground gained has been lost. \"Maybe it demonstrated that independent films can be commercially viable. But conditions have changed now. Attendances are down, the DVD market has disappeared. It's a different climate.\"</p> <p>This could be a subject for them, I&#xa0;suggest, given the preponderance of characters wrestling with failure in their movies. \"That's definitely something that interests us,\" agrees Faris. \"The American dream tells you that you'll have success if you work hard enough, and we have some concerns about that fallacy. Hopefully, the characters in our films learn to redefine success.\"</p> <p>In keeping with that theme, Ruby Sparks did not follow commercially in the tyre-tracks of Little Miss Sunshine \u2013 blame the Olympics, or a release date that pitted it against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, or the more ambiguous tone. Faris hopes it will go down better with European audiences. \"I think it's a good date movie,\" she says. I tell her I'm dubious: won't it be more in the tradition of, say, David Mamet's play <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/apr/14/oleanna-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Oleanna</a>, sparking arguments on the train home? \"Sure,\" she concedes. \"But good arguments.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Ruby Sparks is released on 12 October</p>",
  "<p>At half-time, this is a curiously flat political landscape. No one is a clear winner yet, and few can read the runes of a public opinion disaffected and deaf to political speak. Party conferences fall further down the running order of news bulletins and fewer people watch. Wise money hesitates to bet on either party quite yet.</p> <p>Labour knows very well that despite a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/21/icm-poll-data-labour-conservatives\" title=\"\">10-point lead</a>, no deal is struck with the voters. Without that crucial trust to run the economy best, a high poll dividend from an unpopular government, falling living standards and unprecedented cuts is not enough. For&#xa0;Labour to win a swath of southern, bellwether seats like Stevenage, all they&#xa0;needs is a swing of 4%-5%. But if they want to scare themselves, Peter Kellner of <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/\" title=\"\">YouGov</a> has charts showing no opposition ever won without at some&#xa0;point hitting a 20% lead.</p> <p>However, these are uncharted waters, Kellner says, where past maps may be no guide. As the Liberal Democrat vote implodes, the rules change: more protest votes fall to Labour, who will pluck some of their seats. But what happens in the two-thirds of Lib Dem seats where Tories are the main contenders? The big question is whether all those Labour voters who lend their tactical votes to Lib Dems can bring themselves to do it again. If not, those seats fall to Cameron.</p> <p>The seats arithmetic is imponderable, but one thing is clear: Labour needs to embrace the third party and encourage supporters to keep voting Lib Dem to keep the Tories out. If there is a hung parliament, an amicable path to Labour's own rose-garden embrace needs rolling out well in advance to stop those Lib Dem seats from turning blue.</p> <p>Paddy Ashdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/26/libdems-sketch-nick-clegg-paddy-ashdown\" title=\"\">taking over as election supremo</a>, needs to grasp this: it's no good being equidistant this time.&#xa0;Attacking Labour will save no seats, while turning his heavy artillery on the&#xa0;Tories makes it far more likely that those Labour voters will stay voting for Lib Dem MPs \u2013 and Lib Dem voters who have fled may return.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\" title=\"\">came away from their conference depressed by Nick Clegg's speech</a>. Its callow attack on Labour for crashing the global economy and even for failing to protect the vulnerable was coupled with&#xa0;a dismal \"There Is No Alternative\" backing for Osborne's calamitous economic policy. What a cul-de-sac he has led his party into, and how badly he has played his strong cards.</p> <p>Labour supporters, spitting expletives, vow coalition is unthinkable. But&#xa0;they need to think again. This is not just about cynical electoral self-interest. Even now, with so many voters having bolted, most in the Lib Dem rainbow party remain closer to Labour. Plenty I met in Brighton are social democrats motivated by social justice. Plenty mistrust Labour for good reasons. This pantomime horse of a party can work with Labour \u2013 if it relegates its Clegg Orange Bookers to the hind quarters and gives its progressives their head.</p> <p>Tribal Labour activists swearing vengeance must honestly ask themselves this: how much better would the last Labour era have been in coalition with the Lib Dems? No Iraq, no civil liberties abuses, less defence spending, no soaring jail numbers, stronger climate change action, and bolder Europeanism. That's the difficult paradox. The next Labour government would probably be better in harness with the Lib Dems as well. Even if Labour wins outright, Ed Miliband should not abandon a close alliance, as Tony Blair did with the arrogance of a landslide victor.</p> <p>Can Labour win? Extraordinarily, that looks not just possible but likely, helped by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/22/lib-dems-boundary-changes-revolt?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Lib Dems blocking boundary changes</a>. Remember how no one thought so back in 2010. Insiders said glumly that David Cameron had earned two or even three terms by purging nastiness and going green and compassionate. He found a magic New Tory formula while Labour, at a shocking 29%, looked done for. Ed Miliband's whisker win against his brother boded ill for party harmony. How much has changed in a remarkably short time.</p> <p>Miliband has been lucky as well as astute. No more Mr Nice, Cameron and his party have thrown away their advantage by emerging as the most rightwing government since the war. In a piece in the current issue of the IPPR journal Juncture, Professor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-bale\" title=\"\">Tim Bale</a>, analyst of the modern Tory party, writes that \"Cameron was and is no less a Thatcherite than the vast majority of his colleagues\". A Conservative party whose left has \"withered away \u2026 possibly fatally for the party's chances\" has vacated that winning ground. Unwisely gleeful in wielding the axe, the party wants more and faster cuts, leaving no route back to the \"nice\" zone.</p> <p>Success breeds unity. The shadow cabinet is more united than Labour has been for many a long year, and Ed Miliband has won authority over them. He has risked much and reaped rewards for attacking Murdoch and framing the debate on good and bad capitalism.</p> <p>But all attention falls on <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/annual_conference_2012\" title=\"\">the theatrics of his conference speech</a>. Does&#xa0;it matter? Only watched by political addicts, few ever remember the content. Yet by some strange osmosis, voters do absorb the character question that decides elections. Is he the right stuff, tough enough, trustworthy, competent? Change is the eternal opposition message \u2013 change from this government's failed economy and change from some of Labour's own past, too. Some call for reams of new policy, but wise oppositions are sparing. One or two concrete ideas must light up the party's direction of travel, but good policies will be stolen and others pass their sell-by date long before the election. Labour remembers how they yearned for Tory oppositions to proffer policies they could tear to pieces.</p> <p>Tearing to pieces is what Ed Miliband can expect next. Cameron has ordered the shooting season to begin, according to insiders at the FT. A week ago at Chequers, he ordered the dogs to be unleashed with \"no qualms about making ad hominem attacks\" on the Labour leader. A sign of panic at their bad polls, Labour says, without blenching. If Cameron's softened policy on regulation of the press has indeed pulled the Tory press back in line, then expect the full force of their media dominance to crash in on Miliband shortly. But by accident, Cameron may hand him the chance to prove his resilience under fire.</p>",
  "<p>With Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren gaining ground in the Massachusetts Senate race, US Senator Scott Brown's campaign decided there was nowhere to go but negative. Brown <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Senate/2012/0926/Elizabeth-Warren-and-Cherokee-heritage-what-is-known-about-allegations\">has blasted Warren</a> for months, charging that she claimed Native American heritage to take advantage of university affirmative action employment policies. In the first debate between the two, Brown went so far as to say that Warren did not look Indian.</p> <p>But his campaign finally overreached. At a recent Boston campaign event, a group of Brown supporters, including some members of his Senate staff, <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/scott-brown-staffers-do-indian-war-whoop-tomahawk-chop-youtube/\">taunted Warren's backers</a> with tomahawk chops and pseudo war chants. Suffice to say that such displays don't go <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/09/origins_of_the_tomahawk_chop_scott_brown_s_staffers_mocking_elizabeth_warren_are_continuing_a_long_tradition_.html\">down well with Native Americans</a>.</p> <p>Brown's first apology wasn't enough for the Cherokee Nation. \"A campaign that would allow and condone such offensive and racist behavior must be called to task for their actions,\" Principal Chief Bill John Baker <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/chief-of-cherokee-nation-calls-on-scott-brown-to-apologize-for-his-staff/\">said in a statement</a>. Brown was finally forced to come up with a <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/09/26/Scott-Brown-warns-staff-over-war-whoops/UPI-57811348683620/\">stronger mea culpa and a zero tolerance policy</a> on any future stunts.</p> <p>The no-more-Mr-Nice-Guy strategy is fraught with perils for Brown. He won his Senate seat, in part, thanks to his carefully crafted persona as a genial, regular Joe in an old barn coat who cruises around the state in a pickup truck. Even long-time Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democratic warhorse if there ever was one, counts Brown as a friend and <a href=\"http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/21/brown-warren-push-for-votes-day-after-debate/RtEQIpZLLr2jZyM2A6e2rI/story.html\">waited as long as politically possible before endorsing Warren</a>. </p> <p>The feisty Warren is easygoing and personable on the campaign trail. But she's opted against being either warm and fuzzy or too <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/03/fight-for-the-cfpa-is-a-d_n_483707.html\">in-your-face</a> where it counts for most voters: on television. Her response to the heritage controversy has been muddled and only recently has she come out with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oIVinDXzOw\">more robust response</a>.</p> <p>Dial up the wayback machine and the personable Brown might well have been making short work of Warren, as he did with state <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/21/coakley_aides_paint_portrait_of_missteps_on_campaign_trail/\">Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election</a> to fill the late Senator Ted Kennedy's seat. But in this Senate race, personal appeal is bumping up hard against the realities of party politics in a presidential election year. According to Alan Wolfe, a Boston College political science professor:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we lived in a world in which we vote for the candidate [as an individual], you couldn't lose as a middle class person by voting for either, but we don't live in that world. Party \u2026 matters right now more than the person, and the parties right now have very different approaches to the middle class.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The two candidates break even on the crucial issue of middle class \"cred\". Warren often describes herself as growing up on the \"ragged edge of the middle class\". She worked as a waitress as a young teenager, after her father had had a heart attack. Her self-description could just as easily also apply to Brown, whose working mother briefly relied on welfare.</p> <p>So, Brown's strategy is to keep Warren off her game, which runs on <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-15/obama-eliminates-warren-as-consumer-head.html\">her deep knowledge</a> of the economy, consumer affairs, and Wall Street, lest she get more traction in turning the race into a referendum on the national Republican party and Brown's <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/scott_p_brown/index.html\">Senate record</a>.</p> <p>Four of five <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-massachusetts-senate-brown-vs-warren\">recent state-wide polls showed</a> Warren edging out in front of Brown in what remains a very close race. Warren picked up <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/DNC/Events/Elizabeth-Warren-at-the-2012-Democratic-National-Convention/C3779973/\">her Democratic national convention bounce</a> and ran with it. She hits all the right notes for her Democratic base on Massachusetts middle-class worries like unaffordable mortgages, student loan and credit card debt and bad guys like \"Big Oil\" and \"millionaires and billionaires\". For his part, <a href=\"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/08/scott_brown_says_hes_not_tryin.html\">Brown passed up a Republican national convention speaking slot</a> \u2013 a move that deliberately distanced him from Mitt Romney, the state's former governor and his political mentor. </p> <p>In the Senate, Brown has little room to maneuver on controversial issues like tax policy that are central to Republican orthodoxy. <a href=\"http://www.unh.edu/survey-center/news/pdf/bg_2012-bg32.pdf\">Few Massachusetts likely voters believe</a> that he would raise tax rates on the wealthy Americans. Indeed, he's opposed <a href=\"http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/tax-center/buffett-rule-3653\">the \"Buffett rule</a>\" and <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/07/25/senator-scott-brown-votes-against-extending-tax-cuts-under-gop-democrat-plans/WsuIo08WEpvOo67TYcwizH/story.html\">lifting Bush era tax cuts</a> on higher-income earners while preserving them for workers making less than $250,000.</p> <p>Bay State voters are cool toward their former governor \u2013 President Obama is expected to trounce Romney easily here \u2013 and cooler still toward the conservative Republicans who dominate the national party. Yet, a strong Democratic turnout doesn't guarantee victory for Warren in a state where independents <a href=\"http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/2012_Party_Enrollment_Stats.pdf\">comprise more than 50%</a> of the electorate and historically have few qualms about voting for moderate Republicans like Brown.</p> <p>Which is why the tomahawk/chant episode could be a pivotal moment. It recalls a ghost of campaigns past: the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial race. Kerry Healey, the Republican candidate and Romney's lieutenant governor, deployed an ad <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1031/p10s01-uspo.html\">loaded with powerful racial overtones</a> against the Deval Patrick, the African-American political newcomer. The tactic backfired badly: Healey never recovered and lost to Patrick in a rout. He is now in his midway through his second term; she advises the Romney campaign.</p> <p>Much is riding on the mood of the Massachusetts electorate.

  "<p>It can be said without fear of contradiction that the narrative to the 39th Ryder Cup so far bears no resemblance to the 38 that have gone before. Soft golfing souls would be entitled to question what exactly is going on in this corner of Illinois. There had already been talk of marked men, bullseyes on backs, killing and beating brains in before Bubba Watson sauntered into the Ryder Cup media centre on Thursday morning and paid a glowing tribute to the United States military.</p> <p>If this was not entirely in keeping with the obscure discussion that had gone before, Watson's comments would have been met with widespread bemusement.</p> <p>The start on Friday of the actual golf, one of sport's finest spectacles, will hopefully offer both distraction and sanity. One of the most evenly matched Ryder Cups in living memory has that wonderful quality of being virtually impossible to predict. Which does not deter plenty from trying.</p> <p>Perhaps the loose language of competitors in the buildup has been entirely deliberate. Gone are the days, after all, when the Ryder Cup was a clear and obvious battle between players based in separate continents. When the Europe team landed in Chicago from Heathrow on Monday, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal had only three of his players for company; the remainder could be classed as local commuters.</p> <p>There can be no reasonable claim that Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, Graeme McDowell, Justin Rose or Luke Donald lack passion for Europe's Ryder Cup simply because they are now based on this side of the Atlantic. Poulter, in particular, relishes a meeting with the USA more than anything. Nonetheless, the epic growth of the Ryder Cup as a tournament \u2013 and commercial monster \u2013 belies the fact those featuring in it are generally close acquaintances. Neighbours, even.</p> <p>\"A lot of us are friends, so there is probably less edge. It is not like 'them and us',\" Westwood said. Similar thoughts emerged from Watson, once he moved on from his praise of the armed forces. \"We're friends with all of them,\" the Masters champion said. \"We have played golf with all of them for years. We know them all. We know their families.\"</p> <p>The Ryder Cup lacks the divisive characters of its past, which is perhaps an explanation of the strong sentiment that has been abroad in recent days. The players want to be viewed as fierce rivals and strong competitors, not blokes who wave at each other while completing their school run in Florida.</p> <p>The hosts have plenty of cause for motivation this time around. Six defeats in eight Ryder Cup matches have wounded the USA to an extent that has been perfectly plain even during practice rounds at Medinah. The galleries are visibly keyed up, a factor that will be endorsed by a spine-tingling atmosphere around the 1st tee when Europe formally open the competition first thing on Friday morning.</p> <p>It may well be folly for European hopes to rest heavily on the inexperience of their opponents. The USA have four rookies but had three at Valhalla in 2008 when Europe were defeated by five points. That said, Nick Faldo's glaring shortcomings as a captain will not be repeated by the impressive Olaz\u00e1bal.</p> <p>As ever, there is no lack of on-course subplots. Intrigue will surround how Rory McIlroy handles intense scrutiny in a team environment, whether or not Tiger Woods can finally revel in the Ryder Cup and if Davis Love III can keep his emotions suitably in check. Already, the USA captain has had to fight back tears in a mundane press conference. Love could show no such restraint over dinner earlier in the week, with Watson also reaching for his handkerchief.</p> <p>This Ryder Cup should be more notable than most for excitement. Medinah retains a brilliant closing stretch, the sort that will trigger scintillating matchplay denouements. The complete lack of anything closely resembling rough opens up birdie opportunities at every corner of the course. It also brings the recovery shot, the most exciting in the game, back into play.</p> <p>Some argue this set-up automatically favours the Americans, a notion that is particularly backed up by reality. Love has placed an emphasis on length but Medinah's relatively small greens and sloping fairways mean it would be folly to ignore the value of accuracy.</p> <p>Europe retain four of the five top-ranked players in world golf, a tribute to their respective abilities to compete in different countries and on varying types of course. McIlroy, twice, and McDowell have won major championships in the USA within the last two years.</p> <p>Olaz\u00e1bal will field eight players with overall winning Ryder Cup points records; not a single USA team member has likewise.</p> <p>As a constant backdrop, there is the lingering image of Seve Ballesteros. The first Ryder Cup since his death cannot and will not pass without regular reminders of the Spaniard's brilliance in and adoration of the event. In short, Ballesteros loved nothing more than beating the USA.</p> <p>The odds are stacked against Olaz\u00e1bal paying the ultimate tribute to Ballesteros by retaining the trophy Europe won two years ago in Wales. But the truth is he has every chance of doing precisely that. It would be no further exaggeration of language to point out, in such a scenario, golfing immortality would beckon.</p>",
  "<p>The Football Association regulatory panel that found John Terry guilty of using the words \"fucking black cunt\" towards Anton Ferdinand may, at least partially, have accepted Terry's defence that he did not use the words as an insult. It is otherwise difficult to understand the panel's apparently lenient sanction, of banning Terry for four matches, while Liverpool's Luis Su\u00e1rez was hit with an eight-game ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.</p> <p>Terry, like Su\u00e1rez, was charged with a breach of the FA's Rule E3(2) which states that football people should not use \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour\". The rule states that if such abuse includes \"reference to a person's ethnic origin, colour or race\", the panel can consider doubling the penalty it would have imposed had that \"aggravating factor\" not been present. The panel in the Su\u00e1rez case specifically said that a four-game ban \"is the entry-point\" for breaches of E3(2) and it did double that minimum penalty to \"reflect the gravity of the misconduct\".</p> <p>The fact that Terry has been sanctioned with the minimum penalty suggests that the panel in his case, despite finding him guilty, did not find the reference to Ferdinand's colour or race an aggravating factor such that it would double the ban. The apparently more severe fine, \u00a3220,000 for Terry, when Su\u00e1rez was hit for \u00a340,000, is explained by the fact that regulatory panels take into account a player's weekly wage.</p> <p>To understand how the panel did come to its decision, we must wait for its written reasons, which ran to 113 pages in the Su\u00e1rez case. The FA emphasises that although the panels of three members chaired by a QC are appointed by the FA, they come to their judgments independently.</p> <p>The FA itself brings the charge and so is in effect the prosecution in the hearing, with the accused presenting his defence. Terry's was marshalled again, as it was at Westminster magistrates court when he faced a racially aggravated public order criminal charge, by his barrister, George Carter-Stephenson QC.</p> <p>Terry was acquitted then of having committed a criminal offence, despite having been caught on camera mouthing those words during his altercation with Ferdinand in the Queens Park Rangers penalty area during Chelsea's match at Loftus Road last 23 October. Terry's defence was to claim that he was not calling Ferdinand a \"fucking black cunt\" but repeating the words to deny Ferdinand's accusation that Terry had said them to&#xa0;him.</p> <p>The judgment of Howard Riddle, the chief magistrate said: \"Mr Terry's explanation is, certainly under the cold light of forensic examination, unlikely.\"</p> <p>Yet, after a week of lip-readers, slow\u2011motion video replays and endless legal rumination of how obscenities were exchanged between two Premier League footballers, Riddle found that Terry's defence was \"possible\". He said that with \"there being a doubt\" about whether Terry had used the words as a direct insult to Ferdinand, he had to record a not-guilty&#xa0;verdict.</p> <p>It should not be forgotten, in the head-scratching about Terry's four-game ban, that the FA was bold to pursue the charge against him. The acquittal gave the FA a rational get-out if it wanted to avoid the difficulties of charging a player of Terry's stature.</p> <p>The Chelsea captain has referred to the \"not-guilty verdict in a court of law\" in both his public statements, on Sunday when retiring from international football, and on Thursday, from his agents, in reaction to the panel's finding of guilt.</p> <p>His agents, Elite, said: \"Mr Terry is disappointed that the FA regulatory commission has reached a different conclusion.\" He will wait for the written reasons before deciding whether to appeal.</p> <p>The FA's charge rested on the distinction, which can be quite narrow, in the standard of proof necessary for an offence according to its rules, as opposed to a criminal charge that must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p>In the FA's proceedings, as with civil court cases, the proof required is the balance of probabilities \u2013 whether it is more probable Terry used \"abusive and/ or insulting words and/or behaviour\" towards Ferdinand, than that he did not. Once they charged him, the evidence that Terry said the offending words and the doubts over his explanation, meant a guilty verdict was confidently predicted.</p> <p>However, the leniency of the penalty leaves open the possibility that the panel accepted Terry's explanation that he did not level those words at Ferdinand to racially abuse him. We will not know until the written reasons arrive.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is seeking to head off a major row over the future of the UK in Europe at the Conservative party conference by signalling he is going to make a major speech on the issue later this year.</p> <p>Some uncertainty remains over what approach the prime minister will take, particularly how far he will go to appease the strongly Eurosceptic wing of his party, many of whom want a referendum on UK membership of the EU.</p> <p>Cameron, who has so far opposed an in/out referendum, met further difficulties on the issue on Thuirsday on Thursday when quotes emerged from a speech by Nick Clegg, in which the deputy prime minister called opponents of close ties with Europe <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/video/clegg-sees-growing-debate-on-u-k-future-in-europe-gYobsDCiQXeAwLAibi_3ig.html\" title=\"\">\"insular, chauvinistic and, in my view, shortsighted\"</a>.</p> <p>A report from <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-27/cameron-to-back-clegg-against-own-side-on-u-k-s-future-in-eu.html\" title=\"\">Bloomberg news agency suggested</a> the PM would back his deputy by making a strong case for Europe in his speech, expected to be delivered before a major European council meeting in Brussels in December.</p> <p>But in an interview in Brazil, where he is promoting British trade, Cameron appeared to take a different line to his coalition partner. Cameron said: \"I believe that Britain should be in the EU\"because it was \"vital for our national interest\".</p> <p>He said current negotiations for the 17 members of the EU in the euro currency zone to form closer economic and political ties would give Britain the \"opportunity to reshape Britain's membership of the EU in ways that advance our national interest in free trade, open markets and co-operation\".</p> <p>He added: \"I think that means less Europe not more Europe, less cost, less bureaucracy and less regulation.\"</p> <p>Cameron's latest comments echo an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9367479/David-Cameron-We-need-to-be-clear-about-the-best-way-of-getting-what-is-best-for-Britain.html\" title=\"\">article he wrote for the Sunday Telegraph</a> in June, in which he held out the prospect of a less confrontational EU referendum and vowed to \"make changes\" to the EU relationship.</p> <p>He claimed then that \"swaths of legislation\" could be scrapped in areas such as social issues, working time directives and home affairs.</p> <p>Cameron said the cost of EU membership was too high and announced a government-wide audit of the costs and benefits.</p> <p>Speaking after a private business dinner at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton on Monday, Clegg predicted questions over Europe \"will bedevil British politics in wholly unpredictable ways\" in the coming months.</p> <p>He cited arguments about the EU budget or the proposed banking union as possible \"catalysts\" for a dispute.</p> <p>He continued: \"The channel [between England and mainland Europe] is going to get wider: we're not part of the eurozone, we're not part of these central decisions over a new concept, a new federal arrangement in the eurozone.</p> <p>\"My fear is that that act of further political and economic integration will set off a chain reaction, particularly in the UK, which may lead some voices in politics, parts perhaps even of the business community, and certainly large parts of the press, to demand that in reaction, just as the eurozone is sorting itself out, we should somehow try to pull ourselves further and further away.\"</p> <p>However, in a sign of the difficulties facing the PM at his annual conference in two weeks' time, Tory Eurosceptic MP Mark Reckless responded: \"David Cameron can't finesse the EU debate with a clever formula, as anything less than a clear commitment to an in/out referendum now will just push support to Ukip.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is the testosterone-fuelled, high-octane motoring show beloved by the country. But never before has talking about fast cars proved so lucrative for Jeremy Clarkson, who has scooped a multimillion pound windfall signing a deal to present Top Gear for three more years.</p> <p>The real engine of his financial success comes not from his on-screen presenter's fee, but from the BBC buying out his 30% stake in a company set up to exploit the commercial opportunities generated by the hit BBC2 motoring show that Clarkson helped to reinvent a decade ago.</p> <p>Co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond are also committing to BBC2's most popular programme for another three years.</p> <p>But it is Clarkson who is in line to make the most money because, unlike his on-screen colleagues, he was a shareholder in a joint venture with BBC Worldwide \u2013 the corporation's commercial arm \u2013 responsible for live shows, DVDs and licensing Top Gear spin-offs around the world.</p> <p>Clarkson's financial arrangements with the BBC already meant he was easily the best-paid man working at the corporation, earning somewhere over \u00a33m last year \u2013 but apart from a six-figure presenting fee for Top Gear, most of his income came from commercial activities.</p> <p>The other likely multimillionaire is Andy Wilman, Top Gear's producer \u2013 who was at Repton school with Clarkson \u2013 and who is also credited with revitalising a show that faced the axe by the BBC, by turning it into a boys'-own racing and reviewing adventure format with global appeal.</p> <p>Clarkson and Wilman \u2013 with a 20% stake \u2013 together owned half of a company called Bedder 6, which was set up with the BBC five years ago. Originally designed to keep the pair loyal to the hugely successful programme, and reduce the amount of money paid out by the licence fee payer, Top Gear's global success meant that both men made significant sums.</p> <p>The on-screen agreement for Clarkson sees the BBC buying out Clarkson and Wilman's stakes in the lucrative Bedder 6, handing them an unspecified \u2013 but substantial \u2013 windfall. BBC Worldwide will now take full control of Bedder 6 and the profits it produces.</p> <p>Insiders indicated that the buyout involved a seven-figure sum. Clarkson took to Twitter to say that any suggestions that his share could be worth \u00a310m or more were \"seriously wrong\".</p> <p>Bedder 6 made \u00a315.2m in pre-tax profits in the year to March 2011, such is the success of the company. At that level of profit the business could be valued at between \u00a350m and \u00a3100m \u2013 but the structure of the BBC takeover is unknown. But Clarkson and Wilman resigned as directors of Bedder 6 two weeks ago. Under the new deal, May and Hammond will now get a share of Top Gear's commercial revenue, in return for promoting the show around the world. But the money will be paid to them directly by BBC Worldwide, not channelled via a separate company.</p> <p>In July it emerged that Clarkson's income from the motoring programme was boosted by \u00a3900,000 to \u00a32.7m in the year to the end of March after dividends from Bedder 6 increased from \u00a39m from \u00a36m the previous year. Added to his Bedder 6 fee of \u00a3350,000 and talent fee from the BBC, believed to be just under \u00a3500,000, this took the total Clarkson earned from Top Gear to more than \u00a33.5m.</p> <p>There has been speculation that May and Hammond \u2013 Captain Slow and The Hamster to fans of the show \u2013 were concerned at missing out on a share of the show's DVD sales and income from live shows that went into Bedder 6.</p> <p>A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: \"BBC Worldwide has agreed new commercial deals with Jeremy, James, Richard and Andy to secure Top Gear's international future for another three years.</p> <p>\"This agreement secures the commercial future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world, reinvest in Top Gear and return profits to the BBC.\"</p> <p>The popularity of Top Gear around the world means Clarkson and Wilman have been piling up cash at a time when other top BBC \"talent\" has faced pay cuts as the corporation attempts to cut costs after the licence was frozen at \u00a3145.50.</p> <p>Earlier this year the BBC revealed that the combined pay of its stars earning \u00a31m-plus annually had fallen to \u00a39.7m from \u00a314.7m the previous year.</p> <p>The BBC's millionaire pay club comprises between three and six stars, according to the corporation's annual report. The individuals are not identified, but are understood to include Graham Norton and Gary Lineker.</p> <p>Norton took a pay cut when he renegotiated his BBC deal and Lineker is expected to face pressure to take less money when his contract comes up for renewal next year. The BBC paid 16 performers more than \u00a3500,000 in the 12 months to the end of March, compared with 19 the previous year.</p> <p>Top Gear has been identified as one of BBC Worldwide's global brands \u2013 along with the likes of Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 with the potential to generate commercial revenue internationally.</p> <p>Commercial spin-offs include versions of Top Gear magazine in 31 countries, a live tour that has visited cities including Perth, Moscow and Stockholm. The original show is broadcast in about 200 territories and local versions have been made in countries including the US and South Korea.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">Economy</a></h2> <p><strong>It's the economy, stupid \u2013 or is it? You have to go back more than 70 years to find a president who retained his job when so many of his compatriots lost theirs. Economic gloom made short work of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr. But Barack Obama's record is not all bad \u2013 and that might be good enough to save him, says Larry Elliott</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama should be toast. Under his stewardship, the US economy has suffered its feeblest economic recovery since the second world war. Living standards for the average American have fallen since he arrived at the White House almost four years ago.</p> <p>Despite his rallying call to the struggling and the dispossessed in 2008, poverty is rising and the gap between rich and poor has grown. History shows that the last incumbent president to win an election with the unemployment rate above 8% was Franklin D Roosevelt.</p> <p>If the race for White House is about the economy \u2013 and American voters routinely say it is \u2013 Mitt Romney would be winning the election by a country mile and Obama contemplating joining George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter as one-term presidents of the modern era.</p> <p>Polling by the Pew Research Centre shows that only 41% of Americans say their own personal financial situation is excellent or good, while consumer confidence is lower than it was when Gerald Ford lost to Carter in 1976 and when Carter was turfed out by Ronald Reagan four years later. The last time Americans felt this gloomy was in 1992, and Bill Clinton won.</p> <p>The fact that real median incomes, a benchmark of how well the middle classes are doing, have dropped by 4.7% since Obama became president has allowed Romney to ask the question so tellingly posed by Reagan against Carter: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"</p> <p>If the well-off in the US were asked that question, the answer would be yes. The top 5% of earners, those making $186,000 (\u00a3115,000) or more, took 22.3% of national income in 2011, up from 21.3% in 2010.</p> <p>Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is greater than it has been since records began in 1975, making the US the fourth most unequal country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development after Chile, Mexico and Turkey. All this has got the pollsters scratching their heads.</p> <p>Bruce Stokes, fellow of the Pew Institute, said: \"Back in the spring, my assumption was that if unemployment remained above 8%, the president was going to lose. It has remained above 8% but despite that the president retains a great deal of public support, and that has grown in the last month.\"</p> <p>Obama has been helped in recent weeks by some tentative signs that the economy is on the mend. The recession in the real estate market \u2013 the worst the US has ever endured \u2013 appears to be at an end, with housing starts, home sales and property prices all on the rise.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has lifted share prices on Wall Street by announcing that the US central bank will continue to use monetary stimulus until there is clear evidence of sustained growth. An easing of the eurozone crisis has calmed fears that the economy might plunge off a cliff in the runup to election day.</p> <p>There is, though, perhaps more to it than that. Analysts at Capital Economics say that the darkest days for the US economy were in the months between Obama's election victory in November 2008 and his inauguration in early 2009 and that the economy is in much better shape now than it was then.</p> <p>\"At the end of 2008, GDP was falling at an annualised rate of 9%, over 700,000 jobs were being lost every month and the banking system was in meltdown,\" Capital Economics said.</p> <p>Polls show that many voters still blame Bush and the Republicans for the current weakness in the economy, while at the same time giving Obama credit for rescuing the US car industry when it was faced with bankruptcy.</p> <p>Even this, however, does not appear to be the whole story, as voters in the swing states appear to be planning to vote for Obama while at the same time believing that Romney would be just as good, if not better, at handling the economy.</p> <p>According to Stokes, the explanation may be that Obama is well ahead when it comes to other issues, such as healthcare and national security, and is also seen as a more likable candidate.</p> <p>Romney's only hope in the remaining weeks of the campaign is to make Obama's handling of the economy the key election issue. If he fails to do so, Obama looks likely to be re-elected.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"Health\">Health</a></h2> <p><strong>Obama's healthcare reform was arguably the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency, requiring Americans to buy health insurance and making sure people with pre-existing conditions got insurance. Republicans denounced the act as unaffordable, a violation of individual freedom. Romney pledged to repeal the care act in its entirety but now says there are a things he would keep \u2013 including allowing young adults to stay on parental policies until they are 25. In a trip to the US, the Guardian's health editor, Sarah Boseley, found plenty of beneficiaries of the Obama reforms</strong></p> <p>Dawn Josephson, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, fell foul of an insurance trap. In 2008 her son, Wesley, then two, woke up one morning with just the white of one eye showing and the iris of the other hardly visible. It was sudden-onset strabismus, caused by lack of co-ordination between eye muscles and the brain. His eyes were no longer focusing on the same point.</p> <p>They were paying $800 (\u00a3495) a month for health insurance for their family of four, with an excess of $1,500, and they were liable for 20% of their costs after that.</p> <p>Wesley had a surgical procedure costing about $8,000, although there was no overnight stay. With lab tests, the bills probably came to $12,000.</p> <p>\"About two months later, we got a nice little note from our insurance company saying, 'we are now terminating this policy and we have nothing else to offer you',\" she said. \"My husband and I are self-employed, so we have to get our own policy. We found another for about the same rate, but because Wesley had this pre-existing condition, anything relating to the eye was not covered. We were still going to the doctor every two months, paying anything from $600 to $1,000 for doctors' bills.\"</p> <p>The local Nemours children's hospital offered a payment scheme, so they ran up bills and paid a small monthly amount towards them.</p> <p>\"Around April 2010, we said, 'we can't do this any more, there has got to be an alternative',\" she said.</p> <p>An insurance agent found the family a cheaper policy, which at least saved them money for Wesley's bills.</p> <p>When Josephson called the insurance company to check on the policy, she was told everyone was covered, including Wesley. Josephson could not believe what she was hearing.</p> <p>\"For a split second I thought they made a mistake \u2013 just shut up and take the policy,\" she said. \"Then she said to me, 'we are no longer excluding pre-existing conditions for children'.\"</p> <p>On 23 March, Obama had signed the affordable care act into law. Wesley Josephson had just become one of the first beneficiaries.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"foreign\">Foreign policy</a></h2> <p><strong>Foreign policy did not figure much in the campaign, until the killing of the US ambassador to Libya this month. Since then the gloves have come off, writes Julian Borger, the Guardian's diplomatic editor</strong></p> <p>Mitt Romney said very little about foreign affairs on the stump but he seized on the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as an emblem of America's place in the world under Obama. He claimed that the US response to the wave of attacks on American diplomatic mission had been to apologise for the amateur video that had triggered them.</p> <p>It turned out he has his timings wrong and that a statement by the US embassy in Cairo condemning the video for its cynical portrayal of the prophet Muhammad had preceded the attacks.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign pressed on with the theme, seeking to cast the administration as apologising for American values abroad.</p> <p>The president appeared to slip in a television interview aired in which he described the riots as \"bumps in the road\" on the way to a functioning democracy.</p> <p>Romney responded quickly saying: \"These are not bumps in the road, these are human lives.\"</p> <p>The theme resonated because of popular perceptions of what was widely seen as ingratitude among the new north African democracies for American support for the Arab spring.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, claimed this week that the riots over the anti-Muslim video were a demonstration of how the Obama foreign policy was \"blowing up in our faces\".</p> <p>Ryan compared the scenes from north Africa to the 1979 Iranian revolution, implying a comparison between Obama and the Democratic president at the time, Jimmy Carter, the personification among American conservatives of weak, unpatriotic, leadership.</p> <p>Obama has sought to counter that narrative with his emphatic celebration of those values in this week's speech to the UN general assembly.</p> <p>On the bigger picture, that is some polling evidence that Obama has the edge.</p> <p>A new YouGov poll, seen by the Guardian, shows that, while a large majority of Republicans see their country locked in a zero-sum struggle with Islam, Americans as a whole rejects that view by 47% to 39%. Almost half those polled believe \"it is possible for the west and Muslims to coexist in peace\".</p> <p>Obama's UN speech mentioned in passing what the White House believes are its principal achievements abroad \u2013 the killing of Osama bin Laden, the withdrawal from Iraq, and the planned pullout from Afghanistan.</p> <p>The first aspect inoculates Obama from Republican attacks for lack of resolve over the other two. The slayer of America's enemy number one cannot easily be accused of being weak on security. Moreover, there is no political advantage to be gained in a war-weary America by arguing that the White House is cutting and running from foreign conflicts.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"immigration\">Immigration</a></h2> <p><strong>Immigration reform is one of the top issues for Latino voters. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the US are Latino. Obama won their overwhelming support in 2008, and polls show he should repeat this in November. Although he failed to deliver on his promise to introduce immigration reform, he has taken action, bypassing Congress, to give the children of some illegal immigrants relief from the threat of arrest. He has also promised reform in a second term. But as Ewen MacAskill and Ed Pilkington report, there is still a long way to go to prevent immigrants from falling foul of individual states taking matters into their own hands</strong></p> <p>Latinos living without immigration papers in Arizona have begun bombarding helplines and lawyers' offices with requests about how to provide for their children should they be arrested under the controversial new police power that came into effect last week.</p> <p>A phoneline hosted by the Arizona branch of the American Civil Liberties Union received almost 4,000 calls in two days, many from anxious parents who fear their children could be left abandoned should they be picked up under the \"show-me-your-papers\" provision.</p> <p>Hundreds have been asking for help setting up a power of attorney, which gives a relative or friend who has US citizenship the right to care for minors in such an eventuality.</p> <p>\"People are terrified. They fear that they will go to the store to buy groceries and won't get home, and their kids will be left alone at school,\" said Luz Santiago, a pastor in Mesa.

  "<p>After England's 15-run defeat late into Thursday night at Pallekele, it looks likely they must now win the next two matches in the Super Eights to have a chance of retaining their World Twenty20 trophy. West Indies prevailed without really having to break sweat (well, at least Chris Gayle didn't) on the day the tournament came to life.</p> <p>It was not quite such a thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/27/world-twenty20-sri-lanka-new-zealand\" title=\"\">as the Sri Lanka-New Zealand game</a> earlier in the day, but Eoin Morgan produced one of those magical, wristy innings at a rate of two runs a ball to leave England needing 23 runs from the final over and a theoretical chance of victory. They could manage only seven against Marlon Samuels's low-slung off-breaks. It was remarkable that they had come so close after contriving to lose two wickets before a run had been&#xa0;scored.</p> <p>This time it was not so much a trial by spin for the English batsmen even though the West Indies captain, Darren Sammy, constantly tossed the ball to his slower bowlers. But this game threw up other questions for England.</p> <p>Most of the sides in this tournament decide who their best players are and make sure that they are in the first three in the order. At the moment it is hard to believe that England's top three are their best batsmen. Without doubt Eoin Morgan looked the best on Thursday nightyet he remained in the dug-out for the first half of their innings. He cracked 71 runs with five sixes from 36 balls. Alex Hales hit 68 from 51 balls but they were always playing catch-up. It may be that England are not quite sure who their best players are.</p> <p>The start of England's pursuit of the 180 they required for victory was not ideal. Ravi Rampaul began with a double-wicket maiden. This nightmare start comprised an attempted front-foot pull by Craig Kieswetter, which spooned gently to cover. Next ball, Luke Wright tried to withdraw his bat too late and guided the ball to slip as if he was giving catching practice. In the first over of three Twenty20 matches England have scored a total of two runs and lost four wickets.</p> <p>There was a 55-run partnership between Hales and Jonny Bairstow, who came out at No4, but it took a while.</p> <p>After such a dream start Sammy shrewdly tossed the ball to Samuel Badree, the Trinidadian wrist spinner. He bowled cannily enough, yielding just 20 runs from his four overs, though the situation was all in his favour. He propels flat leg-breaks and ensures that the batsmen have no chance to swing their arms. He is no Abdul Qadir but he knows what he is doing and his selection was justified.</p> <p>Bairstow, in particular, found it hard to accelerate and eventually, in attempting to hit Gayle for six, he was superbly caught by a galloping Kieron Pollard on the long\u2011on boundary.</p> <p>At that point England were 55 for three from 10 overs with an almost impossible target ahead. Yet they never gave up hope. Hales executed some uncomplicated thumps down the ground; Morgan was close to his impish best, improvising one moment, powering the ball over square- leg or long-on the next. They added 107 together in a valiant effort. They could not win the game but they rescued England's net run-rate, which could still prove important at the end of the Super Eights.</p> <p>The margin could have been much greater since the West Indian batsmen set off as if they were going to break 200. England showed hints of the promised aggression with an early bouncer at Gayle from Jade Dernbach. Steven Finn also bowled with hostility.</p> <p>But soon Gayle was on his way with muscular pull shots and the odd swat over the covers. Johnson Charles veered between the hack and the sublimely timed glide beyond the infield, and he would go on to crack 84 from 56 balls.</p> <p>After six overs West Indies were 47 for nought, a score that gave their batsmen ominous freedom. Stuart Broad turned to his spinners; Gayle opened his shoulders. He hit Samit Patel for three leg-side sixes in an over, the first of which might just have been caught by Morgan if he had stayed right on the boundary.</p> <p>Then Finn dropped a straightforward catch, running in from long-off to reprieve Charles, and the batsmen ran a single.</p> <p>Gayle went for a big hit to the next ball to rub salt in the wound; he did not connect properly and the ball sailed in the air towards Finn \u2013 again. There was plenty of time for him to consider the consequences of another drop, but this time Finn clung on and Gayle departed smiling, having hit 58 from 35 balls.</p> <p>England managed to exercise some control in the second half of the West Indies innings. Samuels holed out to cover, Broad produced a priceless wicket maiden and Wright clung on to a skier to remove Pollard. But West Indies, with the bonus of that double-wicket maiden, had&#xa0;enough.</p>",

His coat collar is turned up. His eyes dart nervously behind prescription shades. He warns me that he has nothing to say, he hates doing interviews, he feels like a fraud. Driving to Cannes for the premiere of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/sep/28/kylie-minogue-holy-motors\">his latest film</a>, Carax was hit by a lorry and forced off the road. It was a miracle he wasn't killed; by rights he should be dead. The thought makes him wistful and he very nearly smiles.</p> <p>Perhaps it's the fate of all enfants-terribles to burn too brightly and then wink out. Carax is a case in point; a prodigiously talented little prince who arrived on the scene in a blaze of precocity, with Juliette Binoche on his arm. The director doffed his cap to the nouvelle-vague on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoeGYp0HOC8\" title=\"\">Boy Meets Girl (1984)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tt9dEDUnGA\" title=\"\">Mauvais Sang (1986)</a> before rustling up a bruised Parisian Valentine with the luscious<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKOxOA2kTxo\" title=\"\"> Les Amants du Pont-Neuf (1991)</a>. The problem, he claims, was that he didn't pay his dues, didn't court the press and the French establishment has hated him ever since. For the past two decades he has been winding down and down and almost out. \"From the age of 20-30 I made three films. From 30-40 I made one film. From 40-50 I made zero films.\" He pulls a face. \"I'm 51. It's not looking good.\"</p> <p>All of which may well be true, although it rather ignores the sudden, left-field arrival of Holy Motors, which was shot in a rush and then exploded in the midst of the Cannes film festival like a demented firework display. How does one begin to pin down Holy Motors, a scattershot thesis on the nature of performance that finds room for mo-cap monsters and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/07/kylie-minogue-holy-motors\" title=\"\">a singing Kylie Minogue</a>? It's not only the year's most outrageous film, it's also one of the best. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491777/\" title=\"\">Denis Lavant</a> plays M Oscar, a chameleonic actor ferried through a play-house Paris by his serene, sad-eyed chauffeur (Edith Scob) and variously disguising himself as a beggar-woman, a lusty satyr, a doleful dad and a dying man. Near the end, the white limousines repair to an underground garage and start talking among themselves, their tail-lights blinking, their daily chores complete.</p> <p>For Carax, poor soul, the ordeal has just begun. Upstairs at the hotel, he curls into an armchair and orders jasmine tea. What he'd really like is another cigarette, so he takes one from the packet and twirls it endlessly in his free hand, constantly threatening to fire it up. What he really wants, I think, is for the interview to be over.</p> <p>On wrapping his role in Holy Motors, Denis Lavant described the film as \"a great poetic declaration of love for mankind today\". Is this how Carax sees it? \"No,\" he says. \"But that's OK.\" He insists that it was as though he shot the film blind, walking through a dark tunnel with no end in sight. Even now, he's not entirely sure what it is he came up with.</p> <p>So how does that work with the actors? Did they not require some proper guidance? Were they not forever wondering what their motivation was? Carax is horrified. \"Well, I would never work with people who would say that. I don't work with people who ask me questions. That's the problem with speaking to you.\"</p> <p>Let's try another tack. Some critics have speculated that Holy Motors is Carax's exuberant salute to the cinema he loves. They point to Kylie Minogue's crop-haired \"Jean\" as a reference to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJFFy3soy9Y\" title=\"\">Breathless star Jean Seberg</a> and the presence of a masked Edith Scob as a nod to the actor's early role in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3RdRfmdH64\" title=\"\">Georges Franju's brilliant Eyes Without a Face</a>. Before setting forth as a filmmaker, the teenaged Carax steeped himself in the classics and then wrote reviews for Cahiers du Cinema. Here, surely, is where those age-old influences have all washed up.</p> <p>The director isn't biting. If anything he regards Holy Motors as a science-fiction movie; a parable of human relationships in the internet age. It all started with those white limousines, which he saw as a neat symbol of the virtual world, in that they are rented by the hour; in that they want to be seen but won't let you see in; in that they are like living in a bubble. \"I suppose I was trying to describe the experience of being alive in the internet world. The different lives we are able to live. The fatigue of being oneself. We all get a little tired of being ourselves sometimes. The answer is to reinvent yourself, but how do you do that and what is the cost?\" He twirls his cigarette. \"I know that's true for me. I feel as though I've exhausted a few lives already.\"</p> <p>He was born Alex Christophe Dupont to a French father and an American mother in a hippie commune outside of Paris. He says that he was lost and lonely and in need of a home. \"I changed my name when I was 13. I don't know why but it made sense at the time. I wanted another identity. I wanted to reinvent myself. And then when I was 16 I discovered this island called cinema and I thought: 'Oh how wonderful, I'm ready. I can live there with this new name of mine.' There was a beautiful symmetry to it all.\"</p> <p>He insists that he had never seen a camera or worked with a crew by the time he came to make his first movie. But that was fine because he had an impish alter-ego in Denis Lavant, a masterly cinematographer in Jean-Yves Escoffier and a radiant muse in Juliette Binoche, his girlfriend of the time. Boy Meets Girl was a hard-scrabble love story and Mauvais Sang a dystopian tale about a runaway sexual virus. Carax, according to the New York Times, was \"French cinema's reigning mad romantic\".</p> <p>So what went wrong? The evidence suggests that the director ventured too far upriver \u2013 fighting with his backers and ballooning his budget on <a href=\"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-aaIGyK5cA\" title=\"\">Les Amants du Pont-Neuf</a>, his swooning tale of an alcoholic street performer (Lavant) and a blind painter (Binoche) adrift in hyper-real Paris. The film made money but it left him ruined. \"I was very lucky when I started to meet people I would work with for 10 years,\" he explains. \"Lavant, Escoffier, and then I made films with my girlfriend. But Les Amants du Pont-Neuf ended all that. We spent three years working on it and everyone either died or separated or fought. After that I was left alone.\"</p> <p>Some of the scars have yet to heal. I've heard a rumour that the Minogue role in Holy Motors was initially conceived with Binoche in mind. \"Yeah, we tried to do something together. But we didn't get along, so I changed the scene completely and rewrote it for Kylie.\"</p> <p>You didn't get along? \"No. We didn't get along. And it was maybe a bad idea to begin with. Already people are saying Holy Motors is a film about my films. If Juliette had been in it, it would have been even worse.\"</p> <p>In the wake of Les Amants, Carax went to America in search of funding, but the excursion came to nothing; he couldn't find a kindred spirit. In 1999 he bounced back with Pola X, another wanton love story, loosely adapted from a Herman Melville novel. But the film was a critical and commercial disaster and left its director feeling still more isolated. Making films drives him crazy, he says with a smirk. But not making films drives him crazier still.</p> <p>What does he do when he's not making films? \"Well,\" he shrugs. \"I spend a lot of time falling sick. Falling in love. Reading. Trying to make films. Travelling. And now I have a daughter. She's seven. So that takes up time too.\" He studies his cigarette. \"After each film there's such exhaustion and disappointment. And then if people don't like you and don't like the film, it's even harder to come back.\"</p> <p>Maybe he needs to get over himself. Carax laments that he has trouble finding the right actors, the right producers, and that there is no point shooting if the pieces aren't in place. But how can he know unless he holds his nose and takes the plunge? Just jump in, I tell him. What's the worst that can happen?</p> <p>\"No,\" he says. \"No. How do I know? I just know. I need at least two or three people. I need a good producer. Film has a budget but the relationship with money is very personal. It's not how to spend the money, it's how to spend Leos's money. I need help. I need money. I need two or three people.\"</p> <p>Ordeal over, I escort Carax back outside and let him smoke his cigarette. He stands by the railings, his collar back up, his eyes still darting. I find myself torn between wanting to soothe him and wanting to shake him: this fragile, elfin little man has just produced an explosive, flamboyant tour-de-force and now worries that the world will never let him make another.</p> <p>I tell Carax that I loved Holy Motors and he nods at the ground, endearingly unconsoled. \"It's hard to say who you make a film for,\" he says. \"But if you make them for anybody, I would say that you make them for dead people and then show them to living people. Every time I finish a film I expect a phone call from someone who's seen it: 'I saw your film, Leos, and you were right to make it.' I don't even know who that person would be. Just someone who would make it all OK. The dead people in my life? God?\" He sucks on his cigarette. \"It never comes. They never call.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska dramatically settled his long-running feud with the billionaire businessman Michael Cherney on Thursday when Deripaska announced both parties had reached an out of court settlement.</p> <p>In a brief statement aides to Deripaska said: \"Mr Deripaska announces that Mr Cherney's litigation in London against him has been terminated.</p> <p>Neither party will be making any further comment in relation to the litigation or matters raised therein.\"</p> <p>The enigmatic settlement came just days before the Uzbek-born Cherney was due to give video evidence from Israel next Tuesday. The \u00a31bn private litigation case was due to resume in the high court's new Rolls building. It was scheduled to be one of the biggest battles in British legal history, with more than 70 witnesses \u2013 some of whom were to give evidence anonymously for their own protection.</p> <p>Deripaska was scheduled to go into the witness box in November. His fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, had agreed to give evidence in support of Deripaska, one of Russia's richest men and the owner of Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer. The case would have shed light on one of the murkiest episodes in Russia's bloody post-Soviet history, when rival groups and organised crime bosses fought for control of the country's lucrative aluminium industry. The so-called \"aluminium wars\" were characterised by a series of gangland-style murders, political skulduggery and extortion claimed at the highest levels.</p> <p>Cherney claimed that during this period under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s he was Deripaska's business partner. Cherney alleged that he had a beneficial interest in the Sibal aluminium company, which later merged with Sibneft to form Rusal. Deripaska vehemently denied the claim as part of his legal battle.</p> <p>According to Deripaska, the arrangement between the two men was simply one of \"krysha\" \u2014 the Russian word for \"roof\" \u2014 with Deripaska paying Cherney and his mafia partners huge sums of money in return for physical and political protection. Cherney denied this and said that without his help Deripaska \u2013 now a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin \u2013 would never have become a major player in the industry.</p> <p>Abramovich successfully used a similar krysha defence in his recent high court battle against the long-term Kremlin critic Boris Berezovsky. The case ended in humiliation for Berezovsky, the plaintiff, who announced this week he would not be appealing against a crushing judgement against him by Lady Justice Gloster.</p> <p>Aides to Deripaska suggested that Gloster's ruling \u2013 acknowledging the existence of krysha arrangements \u2013 had clearly strengthened the Rusal owner's case. But they refused to comment on the nature of the settlement or answer whether one party had paid money to the other.</p> <p>Cherney had claimed that in March 2001 he and Deripaska reached an agreement in a London hotel. In it, Cherney said, Deripaska agreed to pay him $250m (\u00a3154m) for his share of Sibal, together with 20% per cent of the shares, to be transferred at a later stage. Cherney complained that he never got the shares.</p> <p>The case began in July. Cherney was unable to travel to London to attend it since authorities in Spain had issued an EU-wide arrest warrant for him. They want to question him in connection with allegations of money-laundering. Cherney left Russia in 1991 and is resident in Israel.</p> <p>Deripaska is known in the UK having been a long-time friend of Peter Mandelson and financier Nat Rothschild. He achieved notoriety in 2008 after entertaining George Osborne on his luxury yacht, thereby creating a scandal about an alleged request for a political donation to the Conservative party before the last general election.</p>",
  "<p>As Spain's government announced fresh austerity for next year on Thursday, the country was launched headlong into confrontation between central government and a Catalan parliament that pledged to hold a referendum on moves towards independence.</p> <p>Spain's deputy prime minister, Soraya Saenz de Santamar\u00eda, warned that the government would stop any attempt at a unilateral referendum, effectively challenging the Catalans to either desist or break the law and face the consequences.</p> <p>\"There are legal instruments to stop this,\" she said, pointing out that the government could simply apply to the constitutional court to ban it before it was held. \"And there is a government that is prepared to use them.\"</p> <p>That clashed directly with the Catalan parliamentary motion, which called on the regional government that emerges from 25 November elections to hold a referendum \u2013 with, or without, central government permission.</p> <p>Saenz de Santamar\u00eda said the only way a referendum could be held would be if it was called by central government and allowed people across the whole of Spain, not just Catalonia, to vote.</p> <p>The heightened tension between Madrid and Barcelona came as ministers presented the broad figures of the 2013 budget, while Spain battles to hit deficit targets and please eurozone countries who are rescuing its banks and may soon have to bail out Spain itself.</p> <p>\"This is a budget in times of crisis but one to help get out of the crisis,\" said Saenz de Santamar\u00eda.</p> <p>The budget figures were presented without revealing exactly where the axe would fall, but with the task of reducing the budget deficit by \u20ac13bn made harsher by a combination of recession and soaring debt payments.</p> <p>Those payments increased by almost \u20ac10bn, with a further \u20ac7bn needed to prop up a creaking social security system. With the total adjustment looking set to hit \u20ac40bn euros, cuts in other places will be deep. Proper details were to be given on Saturday when the budget is taken to parliament.</p> <p>Budget minister Cristobal Montoro insisted Spain was on target to meet its 6.3% GDP deficit target this year, with tax income due to hit targets despite the worsening recession.</p> <p>Ministers gave no clues as to how close Spain was to asking for a full bailout, with finance minister Luis de Guindos saying that it was studying the terms closely and would decide when it was ready.</p> <p>As Spain's borrowing costs began to rise again this week there was growing pressure on prime minister Mariano Rajoy to make the bailout request, which would allow the European Central Bank to step in and buy bonds to keep down the interest rates that Spain must pay.</p> <p>While northern eurozone countries continue to insist on more austerity for Spain, analysts warned that this would further damage an economy that will shrink between 2% and 3% over two years.</p> <p>\"Given the severity of the recession and the scant prospect of meaningful growth, Spain needs more austerity like it needs a hole in the head,\" warned Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. \"The markets are also in two minds about fiscal retrenchment in Spain. Previous rounds of belt-tightening have not led to an improvement in Spain's perceived creditworthiness.\"</p> <p>\"Efforts to deflate Spain into competitiveness raise the prospect of many years of wage cuts and property price falls that will necessitate ever larger fiscal transfers from the stronger countries,\" added Trevor Greetham of Fidelity Worldwide Investment.</p> <p>On Friday the government will reveal the full size of a hole in the Spanish banking sector caused by toxic real estate assets left over from a burst housing bubble.</p> <p>Some 56% of the Spanish banking sector will get a thumbs up from the consultants called in to calculate the size of the hole, according to El Pa\u00eds newspaper.</p> <p>Santander, BBVA, Caixabank, Sabadell and several other medium-sized and small banks pass the test, it reported. Most others, led by bailed out Bankia, will have to ask for money from the \u20ac100bn credit line that the eurozone has offered via Spain's bank bailout fund.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Greece's fragile coalition yesterday agreed on the main points of a controversial \u20ac11.9bn (\u00a39.5bn) austerity package that the debt-stricken country's creditors have set as a condition for further rescue funds. Conservative prime minister Antonis Samaras clinched the consensus of his two left-wing coalition partners, who had both balked at imposing further belt-tightening. But the package, which must be put to international lenders for approval next week and then be voted through Athens' 300-seat parliament, comes with conditions.</p> <p><strong>Helena Smith Athens</strong></p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Kaiman depicts an increasingly ugly and intolerant Canada characterised by wanton environmental despoliation and paralysing political soul-searching (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/maple-leaf-what-ails-canada\" title=\"\">Maple leaf ragged: what ails Canada?</a>, 15 September). I suspect this verdict would surprise the nine out of 10 Canadians who recently told pollsters that \"Canada is the greatest country in the world\".</p> <p>It would also confound the many observers who recognise Canada's global economic leadership, with the strongest fiscal position in the G8.</p> <p>I will confine myself to correcting Kaiman's slanders against the most open and generous immigration system in the developed world. He claims that we are \"tightening\" immigration. In fact, our government has increased immigration to the highest sustained level in Canadian history, and the highest per-capita level in the developed world. He writes that we have \"radically adjusted the criteria for successful applications\", when in fact we are making our system more flexible, allowing skilled tradesmen, semi-skilled workers and foreign students to become permanent residents for the first time. He claims that we \"cut resettlement programmes en masse\", when in fact we are increasing our refugee resettlement programmes by 20% and have tripled funding for their integration.</p> <p>Kaiman wrongly suggests that we have \"eliminated all but the most basic healthcare for most refugee groups\", when in fact we will continue to fund healthcare for most refugees \u2013 such as those resettled from UN camps \u2013 more generously than Canada's general health service. He bemoans a fictitious \"harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants\", suggesting that there is something untoward about seeking to remove citizenship from people who obtained it fraudulently and have never lived in Canada. Far from \"harsh\", those who contest our efforts have access to an extensive process of judicial reviews and appeals.</p> <p>Kaiman laments our refusal rate for citizenship when, in fact, our overall acceptance rate last year was 92%. We are also proud to have the highest naturalisation rate in the developed world, with 85% of permanent residents eventually becoming full citizens. Finally, Kaiman imagines that the number of immigrants to Canada from China and India has halved in the last six years, when in fact it has remained constant, with an annual average of 28,000 permanent residents from India, and an annual average of 30,000 permanent residents from China between 2006 and 2010 (the last full year of available data).</p> <p>Kaiman's imaginary 50% reduction in Asian immigration is the basis of his most outrageous claim, that \"the changes point to a deep-rooted, yet widely ignored undercurrent of racism in Canadian society\". While no society can claim to be entirely free of prejudice, Canada is the only major western democracy without a xenophobic or anti-immigration political movement, and consistently records the highest levels of public tolerance for ethnic, religious and cultural diversity in the developed world.</p> <p>Canada is frequently lauded as a model of peaceful pluralism. Our government's recent reforms have made Canada more open to legitimate immigrants but harder on those seeking to abuse our generosity. It is a pity that&#xa0;Kaiman has aligned himself with the radical fringe of racial grievance-mongers in mistaking the rule of law \u2013 the backbone of a free and open society \u2013 for discrimination.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>A 21-year-old man arrested at a flat in Pimlico, central London, has become the first person to be jailed under the government's anti-squatting legislation.</p> <p>Alex Haigh, originally from Plymouth, has been sentenced to 12 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to occupying a housing association flat without permission.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Haigh was the first person to be given a custodial sentence under section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, which came into force on the first day of September.</p> <p>West London magistrates heard that police officers had gone to the flat in Cumberland Street on 2 September in search of another man. They arrested three people, one of whom was Haigh, on suspicion of squatting and all three have been convicted; the other two are awaiting sentence.</p> <p>The law criminalises squatting in residential premises. Housing charities have warned that it may trigger a surge in homelessness as squatters are forced on to the streets in order to avoid a criminal record.</p> <p>The squatters' rights group Squash (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes), which campaigned against criminalisation, condemned the sentencing as \"deeply disproportionate and unjust\". It said the building the men were occupying had been empty for more than a year.</p> <p>Haigh's father, Hugh, told the Evening Standard newspaper that his son, an apprentice bricklayer, had come to London in July seeking work. \"They have made an example of him. To put him in that prison environment, I don't understand it. If he broke the law, he should be dealt with, but it is like putting someone who has not paid their taxes into Dartmoor prison.\"</p> <p>Rueben Taylor, from Squash, said: \"This marks a dark day for our country, as a young vulnerable person is being sent to prison simply for trying to keep a roof over his head.</p> <p>\"The real crime is the 930,000 properties sitting empty across the UK, not the people who are bringing these back into use. This crazy law is aggressively punishing the victims of our housing crisis, at massive cost to the taxpayer.\"</p> <p>Under section 144, squatting in England and Wales is punishable by up to six months' jail and fines of up to \u00a35,000. The change in the law does not affect commercial premises.</p> <p>In a circular sent to judges, courts and the police, the Ministry of Justice confirmed that what were previously known as \"squatters' rights\" \u2013 preventing forcible entry to an occupied building \u2013 would become redundant in relation to residential premises.</p> <p>Squash claims the cost of criminalising squatting will be as high as \u00a3790m over the next five years.</p>",
  "<p>At 1.30pm on Friday the last broadcast from the Forth coastguard will warn vessels in eastern Scottish waters of any squalls ahead, and sign off with a short, unusual thank you to those listening on VHF channel 16. After more than a century of monitoring the seas from the headland of Fife Ness, the coastguard base is to close \u2013 the first of the cuts by the coalition that will see half of Britain's stations disappear and one in three staff lose their jobs.</p> <p>The modernisation programme in the wake of the 2010 spending review will close nine of the 18 maritime rescue co-ordination centres like Forth; operations will be controlled from a new national HQ in Fareham, Hampshire, due to open in 2014. Proponents say the new network will be more resilient; others claim the loss of local knowledge will put lives at risk.</p> <p>Forth is closing two years before the central command is in place, with all but two of the 12 men and two women who operate the station taking redundancy or retirement. Aberdeen will take over responsibility for answering Forth's distress calls as far south as Berwick-upon-Tweed, adding to its current duties which include the North Sea oil and gas rigs.</p> <p>Some insiders insist the transition will be seamless and the difference negligible for those who rely on the service, pointing out that the decline in local shipyards and shipping has meant less work over the years. Others say that the remaining coastguards \u2013 working long shifts for lower pay than other emergency services \u2013 will now have double the workload.</p> <p>Jeremy Gautrey of the PCS union warned: \"This has got real potential to go wrong over the next few years. They are closing stations without seeing whether the new system works and not staffing the existing stations to take up the slack.\"</p> <p>The frontline rescue service, made up of 3,500 volunteers, will be unaffected. In fact, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency says the reorganisation will strengthen the service, with extra officers to advise and lead volunteers. But more than one in three staff in regional centres will go, slashing the coastguard force from 473 to 314.</p> <p>A spokesman for the agency said: \"The customer won't know any different: they're still talking over VHF to a trained coastguard in a control room.\" But Gautrey said: \"If you're in Fareham, are they going to know the local accents, the dialects? There are very strange Gaelic names in Scotland, and more than one Morecambe Bay. It just takes one call that isn't responded to correctly and someone loses their life.\"</p> <p>Sir Alan Massey, the agency's chief executive, insisted the reorganisation would not mean greater risk. He said: \"Safety is our top priority and I am confident that HM Coastguard will maintain the same high-quality search and rescue service as they always have done.</p> <p>\"We will deliver a more resilient search and rescue co-ordination service for the UK, taking full advantage of modern communications technology and enabling any centre to support others across the network during busy periods.\"</p> <p>Soon to follow Forth into extinction is Clyde, which covers ferry routes serving the island communities off the west coast of Scotland and many leisure sailors in summer. Responsibility is to be divided between Stornoway and Belfast stations.</p> <p>The Clyde coastguards, 28 of whom will be out of work by Christmas, warned MPs on the transport select committee that working relations built up over years with other local emergency services would be lost, adding: \"Technology cannot replace experience.\"</p> <p>The first English base to close will be at Great Yarmouth in 2013. Liverpool and Swansea will be among the biggest of the nine to go.</p> <p>At Fife Ness, in the small 1960s building alongside a row of cottages that housed coastguards in decades past, watch officer Calum McNicol was on his last shift on Thursday. He said: \"It's sad, but times move on. Most people realise the need for change, although some don't like the fact that it's happening \u2013 or to them.\"</p> <p>He is one of just two Forth coastguards who will transfer to Aberdeen; the rest, some of whom have worked at Fife Ness for decades, have decided to leave the service. McNicol said: \"The one thing I'll really miss is the view. On a good day you can see all the way north to Arbroath and down to St Abb's Head \u2013 it's glorious.\"</p>",
  "<p>So is he a racist or isn't he? Is he guilty or is he not?</p> <p>Whatever you believe, the FA's ruling on John Terry, which conflicted with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2012/jul/13/john-terry-not-guilty-racial-abuse-video\" title=\"\">verdict handed down</a> by the Westminster magistrates court in July, can leave little sense of satisfaction.</p> <p>The FA found the Chelsea captain guilty of \"<a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/Disciplinary/NewsAndFeatures/2012/john-terry-hearing-result-september\" title=\"\">using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour \u2026 which included a reference to colour and/or race</a>\". This resulted from his altercation with QPR player Anton Ferdinand in a Premier League match a year ago.</p> <p>Terry never denied shouting the words \"fucking black cunt\" towards Ferdinand, but always claimed he was merely repeating what had just been said to him \u2013 ie, that he'd been saying \"I never called you a fucking black cunt\". The magistrate ruled that a malicious intent could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p>The problem is, the FA has not explained whether it believes he's at fault on the balance of probabilities, or if he's now being punished for merely using words he shouldn't have, regardless of the motive. It's handed him a significant fine of \u00a3220,000 \u2013 about two weeks' wages \u2013 and a four-match ban. So does it accept his story or not?</p> <p>If it does, then it seems a severe punishment for simply shouting his denial during a match, even though his language was ill-advised. But if it doesn't, then his punishment should have been far more severe \u2013 along the lines, at least, of the eight-match ban handed out to Liverpool's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/23/steven-gerrard-liverpool-manchester-united?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Luis Suarez</a> after he racially abused Patrice Evra. And Uruguayan Suarez could at least claim that the word he used, negro, had a different meaning in his home country. Terry would have no such defence.</p> <p>Almost from the start, though, this case has been unsatisfactory. The video evidence showing Terry mouthing towards Ferdinand looked damning \u2013 and especially given that Ferdinand didn't even know what Terry had said until after the game. From the moment Terry gave his version of events, though, it became clear that this was no clear-cut case. Added to that, it would seem an extraordinary aberration for the England captain to lose control like that, in a public place with so many potential witnesses (and TV cameras). It contrasted with the case of Ron Atkinson, the football pundit and ex-manager who in 2004 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/22/football.raceintheuk\" title=\"\">racially abused Marcel Desailly</a> \u2013 ironically the then Chelsea captain \u2013 when he thought the microphones had been switched off.</p> <p>When, two months after the Terry-Ferdinand fracas, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to prosecute, I \u2013 like most observers \u2013 assumed that convincing new evidence had come to light against the Chelsea player. In vain, I waited for this to emerge during his trial. So whatever one's feelings about the need to stamp out racism and punish offenders, or whatever one's gut instinct about him, there simply wasn't the evidence for a conviction. All we'd had was a seven-month sideshow which heightened feelings all round and put the two protagonists under extreme pressure \u2013 and which ended with many people feeling either frustrated that a man they believed racist had escaped justice, or angry that an innocent man had been hounded by the heavy hand of the law.</p> <p>Today's FA verdict will merely compound those feelings. How can an innocent man be punished like this? Or how can a guilty man escape punishment that befits the crime?</p> <p>Terry has at least solved the problem of whether he should be dropped from the England team \u2013 he announced his retirement from international football at the weekend. And, unlike the disgraceful way that Liverpool behaved in backing Suarez despite the gravity of the charges and the verdict against him, Chelsea are at least keeping a diplomatic silence: the club stated that it \"notes and respects today's decision by the Football Association regarding John Terry. We also recognise that John has the right to appeal that decision. It is therefore inappropriate for us to comment further on the matter at this time.\"</p> <p>But the FA decision leaves us in limbo. Only last week a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/18/football-association-parliament-racism\" title=\"\">parliamentary inquiry declared that the FA needed to do more to stamp out racism</a>. The one thing we know about this case is that Anton Ferdinand is an innocent party. The FA must now ask itself: will the events of the past 12 months really encourage victims of racism to come forward? I think not.</p>",
  "<p>Gulalia Sherzad is an unusual woman with an unusual job.</p> <p>She set up and runs a women's centre in Gereshk, the main town in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/afghanistan-british-military-insurgents-taliban\" title=\"\">one of the most dangerous places in Afghanistan</a>.</p> <p>The centre is part refuge, part meeting place. She is part tutor and part mentor to her visitors. But for the Taliban, she is all irritant: the insurgents have said they will kill her if they catch her.</p> <p>If the 52-year-old is worried, she doesn't show it; instead, she regales those who visit her with stories about the women who have come to her, the problems they have, and how she has tried to solve them. She is, in every sense, the godmother of Gereshk \u2013 a symbol of how things have changed in the last decade, and how far they have to go in a country where women are very much second-class citizens.</p> <p>Their treatment under the Taliban was one of the justifications used for British troops remaining in the country following the 2001 invasion, and since then a host of international and home-grown aid agencies have been working to improve women's standing. It is one of the priorities for the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT).</p> <p>There have been gains, notably in education, and in Helmand there are striking examples of women breaking out and trying to establish themselves in different professions, including within the Afghan security forces.</p> <p>There are 27 female police officers in the province now, and though most of them are restricted to doing body-search duty, a handful have progressed to detective level, and they are lobbying for firearms and driving training.</p> <p>Most don't dare tell their families what they are doing, but Corporal Bibi Gull is not one of them. The 28-year-old joined the Afghan Uniformed Police (AUP) in 2009 despite death threats.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of Taliban around and some of my family did not want me to join,\" she said. \"Some of my relatives wanted me killed, but I arrested one of them and he was put in jail. At the beginning I was scared. Now I am not scared. I tell everyone what I am doing. I want to help women in Afghanistan.\"</p> <p>Another woman, a private in the police, told the Guardian her husband was the only person who knew where she worked.</p> <p>In another age, the one before the Taliban, she had been a student at university in Kabul studying journalism. Now, like every female police officer, she has to wear a full burqa at work, and lives in fear that someone might recognise her when she in on duty. Despite the dangers, she perseveres.</p> <p>\"I would like to wear a uniform and be like other police officers. But that is not possible at the moment. My husband gave me permission to join the police, but he is the only one who knows what I am doing. I tell everyone that I am teaching at a local school.</p> <p>\"My brother doesn't know what I am doing. But the most important thing is that my brother-in-law does not find out. He would be very angry with me. All the men in the family would be saying you should not be doing this, you should be looking after the children at home. They do not even think I should be a teacher. If they found out they would beat me.\"</p> <p>Shelley Groves, who works for the UK's Ministry of Defence police and is mentoring female officers for the PRT, described the new recruits as \"amazing, inspiring and very brave\".</p> <p>\"Women want to do this, but they are risking their lives if they join up. We have some very strong women that are prepared to get out there.\"</p> <p>The Afghan National Police (ANP) has launched a recruitment drive for educated young women. Groves, who leaves next March, is trying to train a local to replace her so that this kind of work can continue.</p> <p>\"I would like to see female officers all over Helmand,\" said Groves. \"But there are so many different areas and so many different cultures, and there is no chance of getting through in those areas where there are Taliban.\"</p> <p>In the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, there is a women's radio station called Muska, which was set up by Roma Muhammadi, an enterprising 22-year-old. Muska \u2013 which means \"smile\" in Pashto \u2013 has a staff of eight, including producers and journalists, and they are all women. Muhammadi, who only started school after the Taliban left, has ambitions to make Muska a national&#xa0;network.</p> <p>\"At the beginning it was a struggle, it was very difficult,\" she said. \"The reaction of the men was very bad. That changed when they realised our programmes were not anti-men, pitting men against women. I plan to attract more people and more staff. My first focus is Helmand, but I would like to have radio all over Afghanistan.\"</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, back at the women's centre in Gereshk, Sherzad sees the difficulties that women face on a daily basis.</p> <p>\"The day before yesterday a girl came here,\" she said. \"She escaped her family and fled because they wanted her to marry. They were forcing her to marry because her brother had killed a member of another family, and that family wanted money or a girl in return.</p> <p>\"When she said she didn't want to marry she was beaten up and abused. She is 14.\"</p> <p>Sherzad said the teenager has been staying with her because she has nowhere else to go. \"I don't want her attacked again. I don't want the ANP to get involved at this stage. I want to meet with her family and try to sort it out.</p> <p>\"If it is beyond my powers, I will go to the ANP or the district governor. I will tell the authorities, so that everyone knows what is going on. Most women will come to me before they go to the police. I may get six or seven cases a week, it depends.\"</p> <p>It is a measure of Sherzad's reputation that people respect her as a fixer, even though, as a woman, she has no way of enforcing any of her proclamations. She has the status of an elder, and that has not pleased the Taliban.</p> <p>\"A couple of years ago there was a family living in a rural area. They had a land issue and I got them to sign a document to solve the problem.</p> <p>\"Four hours later I got a call from a commander of the insurgents. He said the decision I had made was perfect under Sharia law. He said the way I had dealt with the case was right. And then he said: 'If I catch you, I will kill you.'\"</p> <p>On another occasion, the husband of a woman she had helped planted a roadside bomb outside her house. \"It was frightening, but luckily it did not hurt anyone.\"</p> <p>Sherzad does not believe the Taliban will come back to power here, but she is under no illusions about the position of women in the communities around her.</p> <p>\"Women are still second-class citizens in Afghanistan. In the bazaar, things are getting better for women very slowly. You can see them around and the young girls are going to school. But in the rural areas it is the same as it was 20 years ago. They are doing the harvesting and getting the wood for the fire.\"</p> <p>There is no official women's shelter in Helmand because it was feared the Taliban would make it a prime target and put the women in even graver danger.</p> <p>So with no other means of protecting them, women have to be put in jail for their own safety. This is still a country where running away from your family is considered a criminal offence, and a man who murders his wife can be freed the next day if he pays 200,000 afghanis \u2013 approximately \u00a33,000.</p> <p>Sherzad runs workshops at her centre and gives lessons on human rights. But she relies on handouts to keep the building open, and needs donors to support her work.</p> <p>That work will be difficult even if the Taliban remain sidelined. Like many of Afghanistan's southern provinces, Helmand is Pashtun, and women here have never had equal human rights. There are cultures that will take generations to&#xa0;challenge.</p> <p>One official cautioned it would be wrong to assume that the issues women face are just insurgent-related. Far too many men have yet to understand it is not a natural right to \"rape and beat a woman\". The problems are so entrenched, the official said, that it was extremely difficult to target.</p> <p>The government in Kabul has made some efforts to change the culture; it set up a ministry of women's affairs, and the country has a constitution that enshrines women's rights to equality, work and education. In 2001, only 5,000 girls were enrolled in schools across the country \u2013 by last year that figure had shot up to 2.7&#xa0;million.</p> <p>There are 69 female members of parliament, making up more than a quarter of the total (27.7%) \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm\" title=\"\">a higher proportion than in France, Canada and the UK</a> \u2013 and in 2009, the<a href=\"http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=43483&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=101\" title=\"\"> Law on Elimination of Violence Against Women</a> was passed.</p> <p>However top-down legislation doesn't work well in Afghanistan's highly patriarchal, tribal society; what is said and done at local level remains paramount. The new laws are not applied evenly, or policed strictly \u2013 which is hardly a surprise given the views of President Karzai's justice minister, Habibullah Ghalib.</p> <p>In June, at a conference on women's rights, he described shelters for abused women as dens of immorality and prostitution. A week later, he was forced to apologise.</p> <p>Blaming the precarious security in some provinces, Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission last month reported an increase of violence against women, saying that in the last three months there had been \"58 cases of violence aimed at murder or [which] led to murder, most of them honour killing or killing after rape.</p> <p>The report concluded: \"This figure \u2026 indicated that women are in danger in different parts of the country due to lack of security, lack of government control, excessive emotional and family violence or presence of armed forces and Taliban.\"</p> <p>And there are broader concerns that women's rights will become a negotiating tool in any forthcoming discussions with the Taliban. Oxfam has warned that women \"now live in fear that if the Taliban is given a share of power then life will become miserable&#xa0;again.\"</p> <p>Women, it seems, have most to lose once Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) has gone.</p> <p>\"The women living here are quite happy to have Isaf around,\" said one of the female police officers. \"The girls are going to school again.</p> <p>\"We don't want the old tribal wars to come back. It has become more peaceful, especially in the bazaar. We don't want to go back to the Taliban days when Isaf goes.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. In times of stress, it's important to remind yourself of the positive things in your life. Provided you can find them, that is; if you can't then theguardian.com is not legally responsible for the tears you are about to haemorrhage. Anyway, yes. The positives. I'm alive. I have my own teeth. (Apart from that one I had booted out during a zesty five-a-side game at the Westway in 2004, but still.) I'm vaguely continent. It's X-Factor/Strictly season. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA#t=0m29s\">Life is good</a>.</p> <p>The same is true of England's Twenty20 team. As that oft forgotten line in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI\">Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen) </a>by Baz Luhrmann tells us: <em>even if you have just been bowled out for 80 after giving one of the most farcical displays of batting against spin in years, remember you are still world champions and No2 in the ICC Rankings</em>. Then he said something about dancing the funky chicken and enjoying the power and beauty of your youth; I forget precisely what.</p> <p>England were a gift to comedy in that match against India, eleven Karl Pilkingtons floundering in an alien environment. The witless ineptitude of their performance was unique to English teams, under pressure, against spin, in Asia. If it would invite ridicule to say they don't have problems against spin, then nor is the problem as straightforward as you might think. England played Sunil Narine outstandingly in the summer; in 2011, they averaged 82.73 against spin in Tests. </p> <p>They do seem to have an mental block playing spin in Asia but it need not be insurmountable \u2013 especially as the best spinners (Ajmal, Ashwin) are in the other group, and their Super Eights games will be played on a cracking pitch in Pallekele. It might be a stretch for the non-Hackett customers among us to envisage England winning the tournament; they are, however, well capable of reaching the semi-finals at least.</p> <p>To do that, they probably need to win two of their three Super Eights matches. (You can go through with one win and go out with two, but two wins out of three is a decent target. Yes, I will sneak back in next week and delete this back if England win two games and go out.) The first is against the Calypso <em>galacticos</em> of the Twenty20 age: Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine, <strike> Johnson Charles </strike>, Dwayne Bravo and the rest. England beat them impressively when the two sides met in June, with Alex Hales making 99. Then again, that game was in England. In short, nobody knows anything, reading this preamble has been a complete waste of your time, and we're all doomed. There's your positive!</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>The first Super Eights game between Sri Lanka and New Zealand</strong> has gone to a Super Over after an amazing finale. It was decided by a run-out review off the final delivery that necessitated at least 20 replays. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/27/sri-lanka-new-zealand-world-twenty20-live\">Join James Riach right here, right now</a>.</p> <p>The toss for this match has been delayed as a result.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.43pm</strong> The start to this match will be delayed as we are only halfway through the Super Over.

That's a serious thrashing in a one-over game. A memorable match has ended an hour after the scheduled finish time. Neither side managed to hit a boundary in the Super Over, with Lasith Malinga's death-bowling skill decisive. What a fantastic start to the Super Eights stage.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Right, to business</strong>. We've had the thriller; now it's time for the comedy.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>West Indies have won the toss</strong> and will bat first. England have brought in Samit Patel for Tim Bresnan. West Indies have resisted the temptation to play 11 spinners, although they have brought in the inexperienced 31-year-old legspinner Samuel Badree.</p> <p>Badree has an interesting backstory: he made his first-class debut in January 2002 but has played only 12 first-class matches in nearly 11 years. His career was ignited by the advent of Twenty20, however, and he has a sensational domestic T20 record: an average of 17.20 and an economy rate of 4.59. <strike> He's up against some of the world's best players of spin today though. </strike></p> <p><strong>England</strong> Kieswetter (wk), Hales, Wright, Morgan, Bairstow, Buttler, Patel, Broad (c), Swann, Finn, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>West Indies</strong> Charles, Gayle, Samuels, Dwayne Bravo, Pollard, Ramdin (wk), Russell, Sammy (c), Rampaul, Narine, Badree.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.11pm</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/drugs-live-the-ecstasy-trial-channel-4-review\">Did anyone watch Drugs Live last night</a>?

This time he starts to Johnson Charles, who works a couple into the leg side, fresh-airs an on-the-run haymaker, has a tentative sniff at a sharp lifter and finally top edges an attempted pull high over slip for a one-bounce four. Six from the over, but it was a very good one from Finn.</p> <p>\"Whatever happens in the next few hours, at least there's been one England win today,\" says Clare Davies. \"<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-womens-world-twenty20-2012/engine/current/match/533301.html\">Our girls beat Pakistan</a> despite doing a fine impression of the men with their middle order collapse. Still if the openers this afternoon can emulate Laura and Charlotte and put on 99, then we could be in with a shout of a win.\" Bowling figures of 4-9, like Holly Colvin's, wouldn't exactly harsh the England buzz either.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2nd over: West Indies 20-0 (Charles 6, Gayle 12)</strong> It is Jade Dernbach at the other end. He starts with a short ball that Gayle avoids. Enjoy the dot ball, Jade, because you might not have too many today. Mind you, Gayle usually takes 10 deliveries to get his eye in. Make that three deliveries; after two dot balls, he mangles Dernbach through midwicket for four. The fifth ball, a slower short one, is pulled zestily over square leg for a one-bounce four, and Gayle completes a 14-run over by timing an attempted yorker back whence it came to the fence. Stunning batting from Gayle, who has 12 from 6 balls. The beast has woken early today.</p> <p>\"Given that Gayle starts slowly, which is a pleasing aesthetic,\" begins Elliot Carr-Barnsley, \"is lobbing down some slow full tosses a cavalierly brilliant idea?\" No idea. Hope this helps!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3rd over: West Indies 26-0 (Charles 6, Gayle 17)</strong> Johnson Charles is the Starsky to Gayle's Hutch, the Pepsi to his Shirlie (or is it the other way round?), the Wetherspoons Mixed Grill to his Hawksmoor Ribeye. He takes a single to put Gayle on strike against Finn for the first time&#xa0;\u2013 and Gayle plays a preposterous stroke, backing away to smash a short ball over extra cover for four. It's time to assert the offensively obvious: England really need Gayle's wicket here.</p> <p>\"Is it spin bowling which so flummoxes England's batsmen or merely slow bowling?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Seems that the more time they have to think as the ball leaves the hand eventually to plop down on to the earth, the more trouble they have. And does anyone know if KP becomes all tongue-tied and hesitant at the mic when a left-arm spinner comes on?\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4th over: West Indies 37-0 (Charles 11, Gayle 22)</strong> Ach! Broad almost dismisses Gayle with his first ball. He banged it in short outside leg stump; Gayle tried to cuff it through midwicket but instead edged it high over short third man for four. This is a fantastic pitch, with the Sky commentators generally agreeing that a score of around 180 is par. West Indies are on course for that and more at the moment. Johnson Charles pings a very full delivery past backward point four, despite a very good effort from the sliding Bairstow on the boundary. I'm not sure that should have been four you know, and if England lose by two runs (Gayle only jogged a couple) we might hear more about it.</p> <p>\"Drugs Live,\" says Gordon Pittendrigh. \"Yes, I wasted some of my life watching Keith Allen take drugs and be ... well, Keith Allen.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>5th over: West Indies 40-0 (Charles 14, Gayle 23)</strong> England are hitting Gayle with plenty of short stuff, although it's only really the high bouncer that tends to give him <em>agita</em>. Finn kicks the stumps in the course of his second delivery; Asad Rauf tells him that any repeat will be a dead ball. It's an excellent over though; only three from it, with four dot balls. Splendid stuff. Gayle has 23 from 13 balls; Charles has 14 from 17.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>6th over: West Indies 47-0 (Charles 14, Gayle 28)</strong> Gayle flicks Broad over midwicket for four with devastating timing. That aside it's another good over for England, even though Johnson Charles is very fortunate to survive a huge LBW shout. That might be a blessing for England because Charles is struggling to get it off the square, or whatever the T20 upgrade of that phrase should be.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>7th over: West Indies 53-0 (Charles 19, Gayle 29)</strong> Here comes Graeme Swann. He has been in wonderful form in Twenty20 cricket since ... well, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/20431.html?class=3;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings\">pretty much since ever</a>. Gayle has a look at his first ball, which turns sharply off the pitch, and works the third off his pads for a single. Johnson Charles then gives Swann the charge, heaving a boundary to cow corner. \"Hit out or get out,\" says Nasser Hussain. Charles's current strike rate of 90 isn't enough on this pitch.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>8th over: West Indies 72-0 (Charles 20, Gayle 47)</strong> Samit Patel is sweating. This much you know. But he'll be perspiring a bit more now because he has to bowl at Chris Gayle. Fret not, Samit, what's the worst that can happen? Oh. Gayle has smashed Patel for three sixes in four balls! The first was pulled over deep midwicket, the second flicked high over square leg and the third clouted miles over midwicket. Well, 96 metres to be precise; it was a monstrous blow, the second biggest six of the tournament. Nineteen runs from the over. This is awesome batting.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>9th over: West Indies 90-0 (Charles 37, Gayle 48)</strong> Nasser reckons 160 will be a tricky target, with the ball stopping a bit in the pitch for the spinners. England are in the malodorous stuff, then, not least because Swann is now going round the park. His second over has just disappeared for 18, but this time it's Johnson Charles doing the damage. He pulls four round the corner, follows that with the sweetest driven six over long on, and then drives another over midwicket to finish a huge over.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>10th over: West Indies 95-0 (Charles 39, Gayle 51)</strong> Kieswetter has a desperate, lone appeal for a catch when Gayle whips at Dernbach's first delivery. Replays weren't really conclusive either way. A single later in the over brings him to another awesome fifty, from just 29 balls. It's not totally sacrilegious to call him the Bradman of Twenty20; his record is just outrageous. Five from Dernbach's over, all singles.</p> <p>\"This isn't fair,\" says Sarah Dickens. \"Not only is Gayle feasting on Patel's pies, he's just run a quick single!\" You can't call that <em>running</em>. Chris Gayle is from the Junior Soprano school: \"<em>we don't run</em>\".</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 103-1 (Gayle c Finn b Swann 58)</strong> Swann enjoys two dot balls to Gayle, but he doesn't enjoy them so much when Gayle monsters the next over extra cover for his fourth six. And now Finn has dropped Charles! For heaven's sake, the comedy roadshow is back. This was a relative dolly, running in from long off. The look on Swann's coupon! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swannyg66/status/248765207072083969\">He looks like he's just eaten his own spaghetti bolognese</a>. England are in danger of falling apart here \u2013 but Finn takes a much more difficult chance next ball to get rid of Chris Gayle! All's well that ends well, at least until West Indies post 200. Gayle slaughtered Swann high in the air towards deep midwicket (I think). Wherever it was, Finn backpedalled sharply to take a really good face-high catch. It knocked him off his feet but he held on.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>11th over: West Indies 103-1 (Charles 40, Samuels 0)</strong> \"Chris Gayle is essentially a superior version of Craig Kieswetter \u2014 both absorb an unusually high number of dot balls at the beginning of their innings in the belief that, once they've played themselves in, they'll be able to lift their initially anaemic strike rate to a more than acceptable level by smacking boundaries,\" says SB Tang. \"Gayle's just a bit better at it than Kieswetter.\" Just a bit. Do you reckon Kieswetter deliberately absorbs dot balls? He does sometimes \u2013 he isn't afraid to shoulder arms \u2013 but it's also partially that he hasn't developed his game yet.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>12th over: West Indies 114-1 (Charles 49, Samuels 1)</strong> Johnson Charles is into his stride now. His first ball from the new bowler Luke Wright is scorched for four, inside out through extra cover. A languid drive back over the bowler's head brings him another boundary two balls later. Even with the loss of Chris Gayle, West Indies are well placed to get 200.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>13th over: West Indies 118-1 (Charles 52, Samuels 2)</strong> Charles laps Patel for a single to his first international T20 fifty, a two-paced effort from 36 balls. He scored 21 from his first 24 balls and 29 from the next 12. Patel's second over goes for only four; England desperately needed an order-restorer like that.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 118-2 (Samuels c Morgan b Broad 2)</strong> This is excellent work from Stuart Broad. He bowls four consecutive dot balls to Marlon Samuels, the last of which also brings a wicket when Samuels slaps one to the leaping Morgan at backward point. Samuels made two from eight balls.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>14th over: West Indies 118-2 (Charles 52, Pollard 0)</strong> With Down Under by Men At Work playing in the background, <strike> Simon Whitlock </strike> Kieron Pollard swaggers to the wicket. He is beaten by his first ball, waving lazily at a short one, and ignores the second. So that's a wicket maiden from Broad. We talk about captain's innings but we never reckon about captain's spells, do we? Or captain's overs, or captain's dot balls? Anyway, that was very good from Broad. Meanwhile, the Sky commentator, Alan Wilkins I think, has just shared a wonderful stat: in T20 cricket, Kieron Pollard has hit more sixes (206) than fours (184). That is utterly absurd. </p> <p>\"This match sounds pretty lively, complete with the requisite cast of butter-fingered Englishmen,\" says Michael Jelley. \"My friend Ed and I are heading in for an audition for Pointless, and thought you and your adoring public might have some top Pointless facts for us to wow them with...\" 65.00?</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>15th over: West Indies 128-2 (Charles 61, Pollard 1)</strong> Pollard, still on nought, slices Patel high over backward point, and the ball lands tantalisingly between three fielders. After four runs from the first five balls, Charles charges down the track and smokes Patel for another glorious six over long on. \"Ksake!\" shouts one of the England team, probably Patel. That travelled 95 metres, just three short of the biggest in the tournament so far.</p> <p>\"Is anyone else horribly frustrated at not having access to the commentary featuring <strike> Satan </strike> KP?\" says Oliver Smiddy. \"A penny for his thoughts now... Woeful selection mind. It still amazes me we'd defend the trophy without the likes of Shah, Anderson and <strike> Beelzebub </strike> KP.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 128-3 (Pollard c Wright b Finn 1)</strong> This is a big wicket for England. Pollard drives Finn a million miles in the air towards the cover boundary, where Luke Wright gets down on one knee to calmly take the catch. Pollard made 1 from 5 balls, and he and Samuels made 3 from 13 between them. Yet West Indies are still on course for a mighty total.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>16th over: West Indies 140-3 (Charles 73, Dwayne Bravo 1)</strong> You know that attempted gag at Johnson Charles' expense in the preamble? I'm sorry. It was me wot done it. Charles is playing sensationally now and has just taken Finn for consecutive boundaries to third man and square leg. He made 21 from his first 24 balls; he has made 52 from the last 24.</p> <p>\"Danger man: Andre Russell,\" says Harry Tuttle. \"His batting has come on leaps and bounds since the World Cup. He is arguably a bigger hitter than Gayle.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>17th over: West Indies 146-3 (Charles 76, Dwayne Bravo 2)</strong> Apart from being boom-boomed for four sixes, Samit Patel has bowled a fairly decent spell. That's not quite as stupid as it sounds. The other 20 balls went for 14 runs, and he has just bowled his final over at a cost of six singles. He ends with figures of 4-0-38-0.</p> <p>\"'It's also partially that he hasn't developed his game yet',\" says Ian Copestake of that earlier comment about Kieswetter. \"The hours of hard yakka at euphemism school really paid off there. Well done that man.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 154-4 (Charles c Bairstow b Dernbach 84)</strong> A stonking innings from Johnson Charles, who I've always rated, comes to an end when he clobbers Dernbach to Bairstow at long on. Charles made 84 from 56 balls with 10 fours and three sixes. He belted 63 from his last 32 deliveries.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>18th over: West Indies 154-4 (Dwayne Bravo 2, Sammy 0)</strong> That was the last ball of the over. \"Charles has now <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2012/content/current/player/333066.html\">scored his highest score in any professional format anywhere in a T20 International</a>,\" says Tom Bowtell. \"Can't be many people for whom that can be said.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 158-5 (Sammy b Broad 4)</strong> Beautiful bowling from Stuart Broad. Darren Sammy heaves all around a slower ball that bounces gently into the stumps. Some hot captain-on-captain action, then, and there are nine balls remaining.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>19th over: West Indies 164-4 (Dwayne Bravo 2, Russell 6)</strong> Russell is fortunate to top-edge the slower bouncer for four. Broad, who has been the pick of the England bowlers by a distance, ends with figures of 4-1-26-2.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>20th over: West Indies 179-5 (Dwayne Bravo 11, Russell 10)</strong> Swann hasn't bowled his four overs, which is very unusual, but then nor has England's 20th-over specialist Jade Dernbach. His last over, the usual slow-evenslower-quick affair, disappears for 15. Russell edges a boundary to third man; Bravo drills another back over the bowler's head and then smashes a flamboyant drive over extra cover for four more. The upshot is that England need precisely <strong>180</strong> to win. It's a good pitch but, in the parlance of our time, the task is seriously stiff and the ask is seriously big. See you in 10 minutes for England's reply.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 0-1 (Kieswetter c Pollard b Rampaul 0)</strong> Well this is going well. Craig Kieswetter has fallen second ball for nought. He was beaten for pace by Ravi Rampaul and top-edged an ugly pull straight to Pollard at point.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 0-2 (Wright c Gayle b Rampaul 0)</strong> Laughter <em>is</em> the best medicine. Luke Wright has gone for a golden duck and England are in disarray. He tried to leave a short ball from Rampaul but was too late on the aborted stroke; the ball went off the face of the bat to the left of slip, where Chris Gayle took an excellent low catch and celebrated with his usual dance.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 0-2 (target 180; Hales 0, Bairstow 0)</strong> Jonny Bairstow has been promoted above Eoin Morgan. Rampaul completes a double-wicket maiden. It seems England don't have a problem with slow bowlers; they just have a problem with bowlers.</p> <p>\"This is going to be nail-bitingly brilliant,\" says Nick Barrett. \"Forget chasing down the Windies' total, are England going to be bowled out for the lowest-ever T20 total or not? This is what being an England fan is about; God how I've missed it.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 2-2 (target 180; Hales 1, Bairstow 1)</strong> The legspinner Samuel Badree will share the new ball, and he hurries through his first over at a cost of two runs. England's required rate is up to 9.88. Already.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 8-2 (target 180; Hales 2, Bairstow 6)</strong> Bairstow swivel-pulls Rampaul almost angrily for four through midwicket. He then takes a very dodgy single to mid-on, and would have been out with a direct hit from Dwayne Bravo. Hales inside-edges the next ball past the stumps. The required rate is into double figures. This is grim.</p> <p>\"Just switched on the telly to be greeted by the giant screen yelling ON A HAT TRICK and Chris Gayle dancing in the slips,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Maybe England should just bat out their overs and finish on 60 for two? Probably marginally less embarrassing that way.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 17-2 (target 180; Hales 11, Bairstow 6)</strong> That's a classy stroke from Hales, an on-the-run drive through extra cover for four off Badree, and he makes it consecutive boundaries with a cut through the lumbering Gayle at short third man. England need to hang in this game and hope for something ludicrous from Eoin Morgan or Jos Buttler.</p> <p>\"While it's clear this format makes aggressive batters tumescent, are there any bowlers who live for it?\" says Ian Copestake. \"Seems they must be masochists for all the kicks they will get from wickets taken in between being whacked all over the shop.\" Ravi Rampaul. Next.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 25-2 (target 180; Hales 17, Bairstow 8)</strong> Sunil Narine comes into the attack. England can't sit on him today, not with the required rate in double figures. I suppose they would be happy with figures of 4-0-30-1. Hales edges a cut in the air but wide of short third man for four; Narine's first over goes for eight. England will take that.</p> <p>\"I think there's a bright side to be looked on here,\" says Josh Robinson. \"It usually takes Kieswetter a lot more than two balls to get out for a duck, and Wright has evidently decided that England's best hope of chasing down this total is to have Bairstow, Morgan and Buttler at the crease for as long as possible.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 29-2 (target 180; Hales 18, Bairstow 11)</strong><br>A good over from the legspinner Badree, full of quicker deliveries, goes for only four. That's the end of the Powerplay, which was directed by Lars Von Trier and soundtracked by Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah.</p> <p>\"I knew the last 10 or so years were just a temporary blip,\" says Matt Emerson. \"Goodbye professionalism, welcome back abject shambles. You've been missed by all true England cricket supporters.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 41-2 (target 180; Hales 27, Bairstow 15)</strong> I had to cancel my bloody dinner reservation for this as well. Hales swivel pulls the new bowler Sammy for a smooth flat six. He's actually playing very well. If he hadn't faced his first ball at 0 for 2 England might be in serious danger of having a vague chance of winning this game. Maybe they still have one. Sammy's first over goes for 13, with Bairstow ramping the last delivery for four. England need 139 from 13 overs.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 49-2 (target 180; Hales 32, Bairstow 15)</strong> Ramdin iron-gloves a stumping chance when Hales runs at Badree and misses. Ramdin was unsighted but should probably have reacted quicker. Badree's final over costs eight and, in the context of a high-scoring game*, West Indies will be well pleased with his spell: 4-0-20-0.</p> <p><em>* Theoretically.</em></p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 53-2 (target 180; Hales 34, Bairstow 17)</strong> Hales brings up the fifty, and the fifty partnership, with a single off Narine. That's one of only four singles from an excellent over. England need 127 from 66 balls. Oof.</p> <p>\"Bairstow may be better walking off,\" says Andrew Hurley. \"He is really struggling.\" I'm a bit worried about him in the Tests in India, especially if they prepare bunsens. He is essentially brilliant, though. It's just that we might need to be patient with some of those young English batsmen over the next two years. And we know how patient English cricket fans are.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 55-3 (Bairstow c Pollard b Gayle 18)</strong> Chris Gayle comes on to bowl his 50mph yorkers. I'm surprised he doesn't bowl more in limited-overs cricket because he often seems devilishly hard to hit. When Bairstow does try to clout him down the ground, Pollard takes an outrageous running catch at long-on. What a take! Bairstow smashed the ball perfectly straight; it seemed to be going for six but Pollard ran round the boundary to take a nonchalant two-handed catch above his head. Chris Gayle starts jigging at the crease again. He's on the dancefloor, and England are getting a touch-up. Bairstow made a scratchy 18 from 29 balls.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 55-3 (target 180; Hales 35, Morgan 0)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYamMpAAR7k&amp;feature=relmfu#t=25m47s\">That was the last ball of the over</a>.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 66-3 (target 180; Hales 37, Morgan 7)</strong> Ramdin misses another stumpin chance. This was slightly more difficult. The new bowler Samuels saw Hales coming and speared a yorker down the leg side. It hit Ramdin's pads and deflected away. You've just dropped the World Twenty20, mate!</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 72-3 (target 180; Hales 41, Morgan 9)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZOurX6BMg4\">Here's exclusive footage of Kevin Pietersen's analysis of England's performance</a>.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 86-3 (target 180; Hales 54, Morgan 10)</strong> Samuels' second over goes for 14. Hales screams him down the ground and then sweet-spots a six over midwicket to reach his fifty from 36 balls. His innings has been very good; it's just that the others have made 28 for three from 39 balls.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 96-3 (target 180; Hales 56, Morgan 17)</strong> Eoin Morgan backs up too far, so Chris Gayle gives him a warning by... actually I've no idea how to describe what he did. He stood by the stumps waving the ball around with a huge smile on his face. No teeth were visible later in the over when Morgan hoicked a low full toss for six. Ultimately, however, that was a decent over for the West Indies; ten from it. England need 84 from 36 balls.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 110-3 (target 180; Hales 59, Morgan 28)</strong> Sunil Narine returns to the attack. How do you hit Narine for 14 runs per over? Swiping him straight down the ground for six, as Eoin Morgan just has, is a decent starting point. A flurry of ones and twos mean that England do take 14 from the over. They need 70 off 30 balls \u2013&#xa0;or precisely 14 an over.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 119-3 (need 61 from 24 balls; Hales 61, Morgan 35)</strong> A handy final over from Gayle goes for only nine. Hales, sent back by Morgan, survives a tight run-out referral thanks to a desperate dive. Morgan muscles four to long on, aided by a rare misfield from Pollard, and then top edges a sweep that goes over the keeper's head and somehow lands safely.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 134-3 (need 46 from 18 balls; Hales 62, Morgan 49)</strong> Ravi Rampaul comes back to bowl only the fourth over of pace in the innings. Morgan top edges a slog sweep for six \u2013 and then Russell saves four runs with an amazing piece of fielding. Morgan picked Rampaul up over the square leg boundary, apparently for six, but Russell, leaping backwards over the fence, caught the ball and threw it back into play before his feet touched the ground. If we tried that we would pull muscles we didn't know existed. England do still get 15 from the over, however, with Morgan running outside off stump to ramp a boundary over short fine leg. Morgan, who has played superbly, has 49 from 24 balls.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 141-3 (need 39 from 12 balls; Hales 65, Morgan 52)</strong> Sunil Narine replaces Chris Gayle. Morgan drags a single to reach a 25-ball fifty, but it's an excellent and probably match-winning over from Narine. Just seven from it, none in boundaries, so now England need 39 from two overs. Hales looks shattered.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 157-3 (need 23 from 6 balls; Hales 68, Morgan 65)</strong> England are just about still in this game. They need 23 from six balls \u2013&#xa0;23 from six balls! \u2013 after Rampaul's final over went for 16. Morgan swished a lovely six over long-off before beasting another \u2013 his fifth six of the innings \u2013 over wide mid-on. He has 65 from only 32 balls. Crucially, Rampaul's over contained two dot balls as well.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>19.1 overs: England 161-3 (need 19 from 5 balls)</strong> Marlon Samuels will bowl the final over, an inspired/catastrophic decision from the captain Darren Sammy. Morgan is on strike, and he will probably have to take all six balls if England are to win. Three sixes and a four and a two will do it. Morgan hammers the first ball down the ground for four despite a wonderful attempt to save from Pollard at long-off.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>19.2 overs: England 161-3 (need 19 from 4 balls)</strong> A dot ball. A yorker that Morgan couldn't get away. That should be that.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>19.3 overs: England 162-3 (need 18 from 3 balls)</strong> A single to extra cover. Hales needs three consecutive sixes to win the match.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 162-4 (Hales st Ramdin b Samuels 70)</strong> It's all over. Hales is stumped off Samuels, who bowled a clever yorker wide of off stump. Hales just ran past it. He played well to make 68 from 51 balls, although he ran out of steam towards the end.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 164-4. WEST INDIES WIN BY 15 RUNS</strong> That's it. England fought back well, with Eoin Morgan making a stunning 71 not out from 36 balls, but in the end they were comfortably beaten. Morgan needed to come in at No4, although I can understand why England held him back in what were unique circumstances. They have much to think about before they meet New Zealand on Saturday. It's likely, though not certain, that the loser of that game, won't make it through to the semi-finals. See you for that game. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",

The site is understood to let users access music for free and compensate artists with a share of advertising revenue by using the Megakey app, which would replace existing ads with Megabox adverts.</p> <p>Megabox appears to be a reinvention of the infamous MegaUpload site that led to Dotcom's dramatic <a href=\"http://www.3news.co.nz/Megauploads-Kim-Schmitz-arrested-in-Auckland-site-shut-down/tabid/412/articleID/240007/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">arrest on 20 January</a> this year. Dotcom has been charged with internet piracy and breaking copyright laws with a business that made as much as $175m (\u00a3100m) allegedly distributing copyrighted material. Now released on bail, Dotcom faces fresh attempts by the US authorities to extradite him but will not face an extradition hearing until March 2013.</p> <p>Dotcom's arrest and the closure of Megaupload.com by the US Department of Justice triggered attacks on several high profile sites including the DoJ and Universal Music.</p> <p>The New Zealand government was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/27/new-zealand-apologises-kim-dotcom\" title=\"\">forced to apologise</a> to the entrepreneur today after an official report showed that the country's spy agency had carried out illegal surveillance on him.</p> <p>But house arrest has not deterred the industrious German national, who officially changed his name from Kim Schmitz in 2005.

  "<p>You could call it the clash of the titans, though scrap between a community organiser and management consultant might be more accurate. Next Wednesday, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney face off in the first of three televised debates that could seal not only their personal fates, but also determine the future direction of the world's most powerful nation.</p> <p>For Obama, the encounter will be a chance to solidify the creeping lead he has gained over his rival during the past few weeks. He will aim finally to blow away the pall of doubt that has hung over his White House from the start: is he a one-term loser, a black Jimmy Carter? Or is he a titan, a two-term conqueror in the mould of Bill Clinton?</p> <p>For Romney, the stakes are if anything even higher. The 60 minutes of verbal combat in Denver, Colorado, may be his last chance to rescue a campaign that is certainly floundering and at times has looked close to disintegration.</p> <p>\"Romney comes into the debates needing some luck, needing Obama to make a mistake, needing to win the first debate,\" said Steve Schmidt, a prominent Republican strategist who, as John McCain's campaign chief in 2008, knows all about the pitfalls of a presidential run. \"He's on the edge of losing control over his own destiny.\"</p> <p>That the two men enter the final stretch of the 2012 presidential marathon with the election Obama's to lose and Romney's yet to win is not how it should have been. No sitting president since Franklin Roosevelt has won re-election with unemployment above 7.2%, and with today's jobless rate of 8.1% Obama should be the one with rope burns on his back.</p> <p>But in this election cycle we are watching conventional wisdom and historical precedent turned on their heads. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">Real Clear Politics tracker poll of polls</a> has Obama four points ahead on 49% to Romney's 45%. More significantly, Obama has begun to pull away from Romney beyond the margin of error in the swing states that matter most.</p> <p>Recent polls show him in front in the seven states \u2013 Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2013 that are most likely to determine November's outcome .</p> <p>Of those, Florida and Ohio represent, as they so often do, the golden fleece of this year's presidential election. Without their combined 47 electoral votes, Romney will almost certainly fail to put together the 270 needed to win.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/presidential-swing-states-%28fl-oh-and-pa%29/release-detail?ReleaseID=1800\" title=\"\">new survey from the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute</a> gives Obama a 53%-to-44% lead over Romney in Florida and a similar 53%-to-43% advantage in Ohio. \"Romney is falling further behind and he's only got a few weeks left to make up ground,\" said Quinnipiac's analyst, Peter Brown.</p> <p>So how did we get to this point, where an election that for months has been too close to call has begun moving in Obama's direction? Not, it has to be said, with any of the soaring rhetoric and appeals to what's good in the American soul that distinguished Obama's first run for the highest office in 2008.</p> <p>At this point in 2008, millions of Americans were queuing around the block to enlist in the Obama army, brandishing their rising suns and chanting \"Yes we can!\" It was a time of great peril \u2013 Wall Street had just imploded \u2013 but also of great expectation that the coming presidential election would herald a new era.</p> <p>Four years later, the country is approaching its moment of truth in a starkly different frame of mind. Where 2008 felt as though the American giant was reawakening, this year we find it nursing its wounds in a gloomy cave. The mood of the electorate, made weary by the search for work or the fear of losing jobs, is as sour as it was euphoric back then.</p> <p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://store.barackobama.com/? source=\" om2012_dd_g_store-search_general-store_||mkwid\"| gqimvs7s|kw|barack%20obama%20store|matchtype|p|pcrid| 13688195643|pl||&amp;gclid=\"CL-v0_bp1bICFcZlOgodznAA8A\" \" title=\"\">official store on the Obama for America website</a>. The merchandise on offer is uniformly corporate: there are badges for sale featuring the Obamas' dog, Bo (\"I Bark for Barack\"), silver Michelle brooches and a $95 Yigal Azrou\u00ebl scarf marked \"Made in the USA\". Gone is the exhilarating underground edginess of the 2008 campaign. Gone too is the single word that defined it: Hope.</p> <p>In its place we have an election that matches the current disposition of the electorate: restless, dissatisfied, grouchy. In Ohio, voters may be starting to fall in behind Obama, but they remain an angry crowd, disillusioned by politics and scathing of both presidential candidates. As one voter, Larry Bushnell in northern Ohio, put it to the Guardian: \"I think they both suck, honestly. They'll lie to get your vote.\"</p> <p>With 39 days to go, that crankiness will continue to be the dominant chord of this election. Over the next five weeks we will hear the candidates and their backers trade yet more insults, see an avalanche of negative TV adverts bear down upon already cheesed-off voters, listen to the endless was-it-a-gaffe/wasn't-it-a-gaffe commentary of the 24-hour news channels. It will be brutal, and it will be ugly.</p> <p>But it will be vital. Obama was right when <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/ transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\" title=\"\">he said in his nomination speech</a> in North Carolina earlier this month that Americans face \"the clearest choice of any time in a generation\".</p> <p>In Obama's blue corner of the ring, we have his bloodied but as yet unbowed vision of a collective future for America, in which government has a role to play in regulating the excesses of corporations, alleviating poverty and encouraging innovation.</p> <p>Putting a spin on JFK's famous invocation \"ask not what your country can do for you\", Obama crystallised his position at the Democratic National Convention by saying: \"As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us, it's about what can be done by us, together.\"</p> <p>In the red corner of the ring, there is the paradox of the Romney campaign. The former governor of Massachusetts has flip-flopped on an almost metronomic basis, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to clearly define his political convictions.</p> <p>All that can be said with certainty is that he goes to the ballot in November on a ticket that is dramatically to the right of George Bush and even to the right of John McCain, who had his own flip-flopping issues. In fact, much of the Romney position conforms to the extreme fiscal conservatism of the Tea Party.</p> <p>His promises to rein back government, to cut taxes, including for the very rich, to stage another bonfire of regulations of the sort that put America in the hole from which it is still trying to emerge, to repeal Obama's healthcare reforms that will extend medical insurance to many of the 47 million uninsured \u2013 all these are classic Tea Party policies. Even his vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, is steeped in the anti-government ideology of the movement.</p> <p>That's one way to parse the importance of 6 November: can Obama stop the Tea Party taking possession of the White House? Another way of articulating the vital, almost existential, urgency of this election is that nothing less than the wellbeing of America's democracy is at stake.</p> <p>If that sounds melodramatic, consider this: Romney's outside fundraising body or \"Super Pac\", called Restore Our Future, has no fewer than 25 billionaires on its list of donors. Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate, has alone injected almost $40m into this election cycle in favour of Republican candidates and may approach $100m before it's done. Emboldened by the two court rulings in 2010 (<em>Citizens United v Federal Election Commission</em> and <em>Speechnow.org v Federal Election Commission</em>) that removed any barriers from the investment of corporate, union or private money into elections, Adelson and other mega-wealthy donors will have pumped in close to $500m come November. That in turn will bring the total cost of putting one man into the White House to a dizzying total of $2.5bn.</p> <p>\"Wealthy donors are injecting money into the electoral process at a level we have never seen before,\" said Bob Biersack, who tracks the influence of cash in politics at the Centre for Responsive Politics. \"The danger is that this will swing the balance of power, effectively disenfranchising the majority of Americans.\"</p> <p>It is another measure of how Obama is bucking the trend this year that this vast mobilisation of billionaires' funds has so far failed to have the impact they desired. The blitzkrieg of TV advertising that their money has afforded, portraying Obama as a European socialist intent on burying the American dream under a pile of government bureaucracy, has not yet turned the voter against the president. With less than six weeks to go to election day, it seems the American people cannot be bought as easily as Adelson and his peers assume.</p> <p>Obama has fought off the march of Big Money partly by transmitting a positive message to voters of who he is and where he stands. His convention was a master-class in political communications, replete with a lecture from the master himself, Bill Clinton. With his help, Obama made the case that the continuing hardship felt by many Americans was not a reflection of his own failed policies, as the Republicans contest, but rather a sign that he needs more time to get the job finished. \"It will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,\" he said.</p> <p>The 2012 election was always going to be about the economy, and it remains Obama's most vulnerable point. But in this crucial area the Obama re-election campaign has coolly refused to be cowed by the Republican assault and calmly turned the argument back against them: the economic meltdown happened on the Republicans' watch; Romney opposed the bailout of the car manufacturers; though the economy still falters, the stock exchange is robust; and house prices are beginning to recover.</p> <p>Those arguments have played well in battlegrounds like Ohio, where Obama's role in having saved the auto industry resonates among its thousands of car parts and distribution outlets. The state has a jobless rate of 7.2%, notably below the national average.</p> <p>Across the country, the anxious electorate appear to have been listening. This week's Quinnipiac poll records that for the first time since it began following the Obama-Romney race, the president has come out on top on the economy. Some 51% of likely voters said that Obama would do a better job on the economy to Romney's 46%.</p> <p>Obama has also delivered a positive message on his healthcare reforms. While committed Republican voters continue to see \"Obamacare\" as a socialist Trojan horse, for many middle-of-the-road Americans, worried about losing their jobs and hence their health insurance, the promise of affordable medical cover for all sounds increasingly attractive.</p> <p>On foreign policy, too, Obama has rammed home the incumbent's advantage. At the Democratic convention he was profuse in his praise of the military, rebutting Romney's jibes that he was an apologist for his country by donning the uniform of the commander in chief.</p> <p>References to the president's overwhelming foreign affairs achievement were kept to a minimum, but who needs quantity when you have the quality of John Kerry's TV-friendly jingle: \"Ask Osama bin Laden if he's better off now than he was four years ago.\"</p> <p>But these positive messages are only a small part of the ruthless effectiveness of the Obama re-election machine. Campaign strategist David Axelrod and his Chicago-based spin wizards have primarily gone negative, weaving a straitjacket for Romney that has constricted his every move.</p> <p>While Romney and his conservative rivals were slugging it out with each other for the Republican nomination, the Obama team were quietly working behind the scenes to define Romney's biography. In a series of attack ads aired remorselessly in the swing states, they painted him as a rich kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth who had no affinity with the daily trials of the middle classes, destroyed ordinary people's lives as head of Bain Capital, and was so arrogant that he wouldn't declare his taxes.</p> <p>Quinnipiac's Peter Brown, who as a polling analyst sides with neither of the two main parties, says he has never witnessed such a successful character assassination in a presidential race. \"They have turned Romney into a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist, who is just not someone the average voter wants to have a beer with.\"</p> <p>Republican strategist Steve Schmidt believes the rot set in earlier this year when the Romney campaign made the mistake of conserving its war chest rather than investing it aggressively in a counter-offensive. Inexplicably, in his view, the Republican candidate was unprepared for the onslaught; he was caught off guard by the furore over his tax returns and was ill-equipped to defend himself on Bain Capital \u2013 a bizarre weakness given that Romney's record at the firm has been a political thorn in his side right back to his 1994 duel with Ted Kennedy for a US senate seat.</p> <p>In Schmidt's opinion, Romney made the basic error of seeing the election as a referendum on Obama's four years in office and not as a choice between two conflicting political visions: \"The Romney campaign was premised on the notion that Obama could not be re-elected with unemployment as high as it was and pessimism running in the country as high as it was. All that Mitt Romney had to do was to hold steady and the electorate would come to him.\"</p> <p>It didn't. Since the start of the presidential election proper this month, Romney's malaise has only deepened. Everything he has done since, according to Schmidt, \"has been the opposite of what he needed to do to get over the plausibility bar, so that people look at him and see him as a commander-in-chief.\"</p> <p>First he forgot to mention Afghanistan and returning war heroes in his convention speech \u2013 an astonishing error from the party that claims to own national security. Then he made hasty remarks about the death of the US ambassador in Libya.</p> <p>And to cap it all, there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">the \"47 per cent\" gaffe.</a> In remarks made before donors paying $50,000 per plate, he essentially accused almost half the nation of being lazy no-hopers suffering from a victim complex and languishing in the pocket of the president.</p> <p>Given that litany of horrors, Romney faces huge difficulties as he goes into Wednesday night. This race is not over: there is time yet for an upset. But the challenger from Massachusetts must access hidden strengths if he is to appear on 7&#xa0;November looking like a titan and not a mouse.</p>",
  "<p>Saudi Arabian officials have deported 241 Nigerian women from the annual hajj pilgrimage, and are threatening to send back hundreds of others said to be travelling without male chaperones, prompting a diplomatic row between the two countries.</p> <p>Nigerian officials responsible for organising the hajj said three planes were turned back from the Saudi city of Medina, while a further 1,000 women were held in detention centres in Mecca, some for up to five days. Under Saudi law, women are minors who require permission from a male relative to work, leave the country or, in some cases, receive medical treatment.</p> <p>But Nigeria's Saudi ambassador, Abubakar Shehu Bunu, said it had been agreed Nigerians could perform the rites as long as they were accompanied by local officials once they were in Saudi Arabia. Bunu has lodged a formal complaint with Saudi authorities.</p> <p>Many of the women who were sent back arrived in tears, some carrying babies strapped to their backs. \"We are all so sad. I used my last savings to top up what my cousin provided to pay for a hajj seat, only to be treated like infidels who are not fellow Muslims,\" said Halima Muhammad, who spent two days in a detention centre.</p> <p>\"From the airport we were all rounded up and taken to a facility that is not fit for humans. No one offered us anything, we had only water and slept on bare floors,\" she said by phone from Katsina. Others said they spent hours in darkened planes and were sent back without disembarking.</p> <p>Many Africans save for years to scrape together the \u00a33,000 fee; rich Muslim philanthropists and politicians sponsor pilgrims each year. Approximately half of Nigeria's 160-million strong population practise Islam, making it Africa's most populous Muslim country. But women are generally free to move around on their own, even in stricter northern states that practise sharia law. All Muslims who can afford it are required to perform the hajj at least once in their lifetime, according to the five pillars of Islam.</p> <p>Relations between the two oil-producing countries have been strained over the hajj in recent years. A Nigerian hajj official said some of the deported women had gone with male chaperones. \"Their crime was that some boarded different aircrafts to the men who were supposed to lead them in. So some of them disembarked from the aircraft at different times to the men,\" the official said.</p> <p>Last year, Saudi Arabia said it had deported several thousand undocumented Nigerians from the country over a one-year period. The hajj visa allows visitors to stay up to 45 days, though the rites do not normally take more than four days to complete.</p> <p>Saudi's interior ministry says that it deports more than 700,000 foreign nationals each year, including more than 20,000 who overstay their visas after arriving for the hajj.</p> <p>Nigerian Lawan Kaita, a Muslim leader from the city of Katsina and former governor, said Muslim elders in the city were calling for a \"strong response from Muslims across the world\". \"It's a slap in the face for Nigeria and all Muslims. Saudi Arabia has the privilege of being hosts, but it shouldn't stop others from coming to do the hajj,\" he said.</p> <p>Other African countries have faced similar woes in organising their citizens. Egypt's foreign ministry reported 12 citizens were deported daily during the pilgrimage last year. In Ivory Coast, authorities overfilled their quota last year, eventually leaving several hundred unable to undertake the trip.</p> <p>Around 2 million visitors will perform the hajj this year, with Saudi Arabia rejecting requests from 40 countries around the world to increase their quotas. Each Muslim country can send 1,000 pilgrims per million citizens.</p>",

Andrews's staging leaves the sisters stranded \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_%28play%29#Winnie\">Winnie-like</a> \u2013 on a mound of earth, not yet up to their necks but sinking fast. During the whole of the previous act they have had to adapt to a world in which the ground has not just shifted but is literally disappearing beneath their feet. Not since Chris Goode <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/jun/14/theatre.reviews\">introduced rabbits on to the stage in the final act of Sisters at the Gate in 2008</a>, have the Prozorov sisters had to be quite so on their toes. It is thrilling and heart-breaking. </p> <p>Like Thomas Ostermeier's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/feb/29/theatre1\">versions of Ibsen</a>, or Yael Farber's recent South African take on <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review\">Strindberg's Miss Julie</a>, Andrews's production of a classic play doesn't come with the side order of aspic which is so often on the menu when British directors tackle classic work. A classic play is simply one that is tried and tested. Audiences and directors already know that it works, so why not take the opportunity, as Andrews does here, to explore and play; slicing through the musty layers of performance history in which it is cloaked? </p> <p>Classic is a tag that should signal liberation, not a padlock. If Shakespeare really is our contemporary, why are so many revivals so timid and reverential? Why is it that so often when watching Hedda Gabler or Three Sisters, you long for somebody to hand Hedda a gun or give the sisters an up-to-date train timetable.</p> <p>Companies such as Filter have been busily reimagining classic plays tackling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/jan/26/three-sisters-lyric-hammersmith\">Chekhov's unhappy girls</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/apr/09/the-factory-chekhov-seagull\">the Factory</a> have reinvented The Seagull and Hamlet, and the Young Vic \u2013 very much on a roll \u2013 has had an unparalleled year of dusting down classics with Joe Hill Gibbins's brilliant revival of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/feb/03/the-changeling-review\">The Changeling</a>, and versions of Strindberg's Miss Julie and Ibsen's A Doll's House. Change is in the air. I am hoping that Mike Bartlett and Headlong will be giving <a href=\"http://headlongtheatre.co.uk/productions/production_details.php?Title=Medea&amp;production_id=33\">Medea</a> a good kick up the bum when she goes out tour from Glasgow's Citizens next week. </p> <p>Yet, too often when British directors (think Maria Aberg's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/apr/20/king-john-review\">King John</a> at the RSC or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2008/jul/30/katiemitchelldirectorordes\">Katie Mitchell's</a> Seagull at the National) do approach classic texts with new ideas, instead of welcoming their radicalism, a cry of foul goes up, particularly if the work is being staged at a revered institution. Experiment for experiment's sake is as dull as hidebound traditionalism (and often more irritating), but if we really believe these old plays have something to say to us now, then we must put a little more faith in their robustness and our homegrown directors' skill and imaginations. </p> <p>I very much hope that as many rising British directors as possible get a chance to see Andrews's Three Sisters, not so they can copy, but so they can be reminded that when staged without fear and with clarity and vision Olga, Masha and Irina may still not get to Moscow, but that they can be liberated in other ways.</p>",

  "<p>Surrey are reported to have offered Graeme Smith the chance to become their captain, ideally if he is prepared to reduce his international commitments with South Africa to take control at The Oval.</p> <p>Rory Hamilton-Brown resigned as captain after the death of his flat-mate Tom Maynard midway through the 2012 season, and has since left the club.</p> <p>Surrey have already signed the experienced former England batsman Vikram Solanki from Worcestershire for next season and been linked with a number of other players. However, ESPN CricInfo claimed on Thursday that Smith, arguably the most respected captain in world cricket after leading South Africa to the top of the world Test rankings following their victory in England, is at the top of their list.</p> <p>Smith, who has played for Somerset, certainly has fond memories of The Oval, having scored a century in his 100th Test there three months ago.</p> <p>There is a theory that after the birth of his first child shortly after that match, he may be tempted by the opportunity to settle for a while in London with his Irish wife. He has already lost his place in South Africa's Twenty20 team and handed the captaincy to AB de Villiers in 50-over cricket.</p> <p>He has also spoken of a desire to end his Test career back in the ranks, which would cast doubts on Surrey's chances of success.</p> <p>Yorkshire have beaten off competition from several other counties to sign Jack Brooks, the England Lions seamer who had exercised a release clause in his contract with Northamptonshire.</p> <p>Brooks, a 28-year-old who has become one of the more recognisable players on the county circuit in a white headband similar to the one worn by John McEnroe at Wimbledon, has signed a three-year contract.

  "<p>Thousands of ex-offenders are to be targeted in a national drive to add their profiles to the police DNA database in an attempt to solve hundreds of crimes.</p> <p>The campaign will focus on 11,993 criminals convicted of serious offences such as murder, manslaughter and rape in the past 40 years, the Association of Chief Police officers said on Thursday.</p> <p>A linked operation in Greater Manchester began last week with police aiming to test 2,000 people convicted of serious offences before 1995.</p> <p>Forces are using powers under the Crime and Security Act 2010, which became law last year. The aim is to gather DNA profiles from criminals who were convicted before the database \u2013 which now contains 6.5m profiles \u2013 was set up in 1995. Meanwhile, the profiles of 1.1 million individuals who have been arrested but never convicted remain on the database.</p> <p>Codenamed Operation Nutmeg, the sweep aims to ensure all those convicted of serious offences are added to the database. Their profiles will then be checked against unsolved crimes to see if there are any matches. Many of those targeted over the next year will now be in their 70s.</p> <p>Each of the 43 forces in England and Wales has appointed an officer dedicated to the DNA sampling. Acpo said it would carry out an assessment of individuals who had committed serious crimes in the past but were not on the database. It would only take mouth swabs of ex-offenders after a risk assessment was made in each case.</p> <p>In a sample operation in Hampshire, 471 individuals were examined but it was discovered that many had died or were already on the database because they had reoffended since 1995. Of the 167 individuals whose DNA profiles were taken there were no hits against unsolved crimes.</p> <p>The aim, senior officers said, was to ensure police could maximise opportunities to prevent and detect crime as a result of the Crime and Security Act 2010.</p> <p>Acpo's lead on the DNA database, Amanda Cooper, who is director of information and strategy at Thames Valley Police, said: \"DNA evidence has proven to be a vital tool for the police which has helped convict thousands of violent and dangerous criminals and exonerated many innocent people.</p> <p>\"We are seeking to assure the public that police have done all in their duty to ensure that no opportunities have been missed to secure justice for victims of crime.\"</p> <p>In Greater Manchester officers have been visiting the homes of convicted criminals and inviting them to provide a DNA sample on the spot or visit a police station at a later date. If individuals refuse, officers have the power to make them provide a mouth swab under the 2010 act.</p> <p>The move comes as the profiles of hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have been arrested but not convicted of any crimes remain on the DNA database.</p> <p>Powers to remove the profiles of the innocent are contained in the Protection of Freedoms Act which came onto the statute book in May. But the powers have not yet come into force which means that the police can continue taking DNA samples from all individuals they arrest, including for minor offences.</p> <p>Nick Pickles, director of the civil liberties and privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: \"Members of the public will expect the police to be pursing active investigations and in the overwhelming majority of these cases the people having their sample taken will not be suspected of any new crime.</p> <p>\"Diverting resources away from following up current leads to track down people based on convictions that may be decades old is a questionable strategy at a time when the police are already overstretched.</p> <p>\"I hope forces will be giving equal focus to addressing the many innocent people on the DNA database who are now entitled to have their profile deleted, as was decided by parliament in May.\"</p> <p>Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"It strikes me as bizarre that at a time when the police are facing the most severe budget cuts and job losses in a generation, this is how they choose to spend what little money they have left.</p> <p>\"Is the public better served by the police going out on the beat and keeping our neighbourhoods safe \u2013 or going on a wild goose chase after thousands of people, who may have served their time decades ago, just so an officer can give each of them a DNA swab?\"</p>",
  "<p>There was a definite sense of relief and jubilation on Thursday night when members of <a href=\"http://www.well.com\" title=\"\">The WELL</a> \u2013 the 27-year-old San Francisco-based conferencing system put up for sale in July by its then owner, Salon Media Group \u2013 learned that the system and the domain name well.com had been bought by a group of long-time members. The sale price was <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/09/25/users-bet-400000-on-the-well-an-original-online-hangout/\" title=\"\">later disclosed as $400,000</a> in the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>The purchase brings it back from what looked like the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/03/well-salon-sale\" title=\"\">edge of a precipice</a>&lt;/a&gt; in July. Salon Media had said that besides seeking a sale, it would not accept any new subscriptions; the information filed showed that it was bringing in $380,000 per year from its 2,700-odd members, and was making a modest profit.</p> <p>\"We own our own words \u2013 for real\" was the general feeling among members following the sale, referring to The WELL's long-held mantra: \"You own your own words\". Although, strictly speaking, that isn't really true: we don't own our own words so much as our words are now under the control of people we feel we know very well and can trust. Furthermore, YOYOW (as WELL members call this mantra) is only partially a statement about copyright; it also signals accountability. Yet it is a matter of great pride and a unique selling point to the WELL \u2013 try that on Facebook or any of today's other data hogs.</p> <p>Formally titled The WELL Group Inc., the new owner is a corporation formed in August. Its 11 shareholders, board, and officers have all been WELL members for an average of 20 years or more. The new chief executive, Earl Crabb, is a Berkeley-based software product designer, and the best-known of the shareholders is Jim Rutt, who was CEO of Network Solutions during the late 1990s. The WELL Group is a for-profit corporation, not a non-profit or a co-operative \u2013 which is probably a good thing, given that WELL members can argue for days about almost anything, no matter how trivial.</p> <p>\"It was the unbelievable show of member support, plus the member pledges, that empowered the investor group of WELLperns to make the offer accepted by Salon Media Group,\" Crabb wrote in the announcement posted Thursday night. \"It is every single member of the WELL who can take a bow, pop the champagne, and celebrate.\"</p> <p>After acquiring The WELL the investor group is now organising its activities, with the immediate goal of managing the transition and formulating a plan for the longer term. However, unlike newer social networks, The WELL doesn't need to adopt a marketing plan aimed at fast growth; member subscriptions pay the system's expenses and even generate a modest profit. The new owners can afford to manage the transition and observe developments for a time before aiming at what the announcement calls \"some slow growth\". Existing members can send interested friends invitations for a free three-month trial.</p> <p>In the meantime, members can stop making backup copies of their favourite topics and go back to what they do best: conversation. And complaining about the management.</p>",

  "<h2>JOHN TERRY BANNED AFTER BEING FOUND GUILTY OF RACISM</h2> <p>John Terry is considering an appeal after the FA's disciplinary hearing found him guilty of \"using abusive language\" towards QPR's Anton Ferdinand last October which \"included a reference to colour and/or race\". The independent regulatory commission delivered its verdict on Thursday after a four-day hearing, ruling that Terry must serve a four-game ban and pay a fine of \u00a3220,000.</p> <p>Terry, who was cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence at Westminster magistrates' court in July over the same incident, categorically denied the FA charge, and has the right to appeal the ruling within 14 days. An FA statement said: \"The penalty is suspended until after the outcome of any appeal, or the time for appealing expires, or should Mr Terry decide not to appeal.\"</p> <p>A statement issued by Terry's management company said: \"Mr Terry is disappointed that the FA Regulatory Commission has reached a different conclusion to the clear not guilty verdict of a court of law. He has asked for the detailed written reasons of the decision and will consider them carefully before deciding whether to lodge an appeal.\"</p> <p>The case centred around an incident during Chelsea's Premier League defeat at QPR on 23 October last year when the pair repeatedly clashed verbally. During his court case Terry admitted using the words \"f***ing black c***\", but insisted he had only been repeating words he thought Ferdinand had accused him of saying.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Harry rang me last Sunday and said there was abolutely no truth in it. The only worrying thing was at the end of the conversation he asked me what the best areas to live were\" \u2014 Paul Jewell tells the BBC that Harry Redknapp has assured him he is not after his job at Ipswich Town.</p> <h2>JACK BACK AFTER KNACK</h2> <p>Everyone knows that once Jack Wilshere is back to full fitness Spain's days as international top perros will be numbered. Yup, Jack once did a little pass that was vaguely reminiscent of Xavi, meaning he'll be able to transform Mr Roy's England into a free-flowing tiki-takaing machine before you can say \"last 16 exit in Rio\".</p> <p>The good news for England - and Arsenal we suppose - is that Wilshere will be fit to play for Arsenal's Under-21s this coming Monday. It's no mean feat to break into the Arsenal Under-21s either, given that Wenger has bought 97% of the world's Under-21 population at some point in his career.</p> <p>\"It is massive for [WIlshere] to come back, and for us as well,\" hoorayed Wenger. \"Jack will play his first game, maybe an hour, something like that. It's another important step. When you are at that age and are out for such a long time, that is absolutely massive to take.\"</p> <p>England do have World Cup qualifiers in October but Wenger reckons that will be too soon to return to internationals. \"I think that will be too early for him. He has not played for 14 months,\" added Wenger, roadblocking the club v country debate in nice and early. Wenger wasn't finished there though, oh no. With nothing else going on today \u2013 apart from some minor FA disciplinary hearing \u2013 he held forth on everything from psephological data in 19th-century Sweden (go Carl Johan Thyselius!) to exactly which Premier League player has a fetish for kangaroos.</p> <p>But all that stuff is a tad dull, so let's trot out his quotes about Olivier Giroud scoring a goal in League Cup last night. \"At the moment I believe he is looking for confidence and that goal will help him,\" Wenger said, as one hack was led out after fainting at the explicit nature of those kangaroo revelation. \"I expect him to take that into the Premier League.\"</p> <p>And with that he trotted off, safe in the knowledge that absolutely nothing else will happen involving one of the major figures in English football.

IT'S LIKE 2001 ALL OVER AGAIN</h2>",
  "<p>A tight game was craved in this tournament and we surely got one under the floodlights of Pallekele. Amid great melodrama it was eventually Sri Lanka who took the points. The 20-over match was tied, which meant that there was a super over. In the six-ball eliminator, the Sri Lankans managed to defend their total of 13.</p> <p>Lasith Malinga, to the ecstatic delight of the home crowd, rose to the occasion. Despite a dropped catch by Kumar Sangakkara behind the stumps, New Zealand could manage only seven runs after Martin Guptill was coolly caught by Tillakaratne Dilshan inches from the boundary rope at long-off from the fifth ball.</p> <p>Throughout most of the chase of 175 runs, the prospect of a super over seemed remote. Sri Lanka seemed to be in control after a silky innings from Mahela Jayawardene and a sparky one from Dilshan. In the 15th over, when Jeevan Mendis was out, the home side needed another 44, often not too much of a problem in this form of the game. But now the Kiwis refused to let go.</p> <p>Tim Southee inspired them by bowling full and fast from around the wicket to check the flow of boundaries. Just as important was his arrow-like throw from the cover boundary to run out Dilshan for 76. Even so, just one run was needed to win the game from the last ball.</p> <p>Lahiru Thirrimane was on strike and had to hare for the bowler's end having failed to make contact. James Franklin hurled the ball to the non-striker's end. There Ross Taylor failed to take it cleanly and looked disconsolate and started to shake hands with umpires and opposition players. But a bail had been removed.</p> <p>Countless replays from every possible angle were studied and third umpire Steve Davis decided that the ball ricocheting off Taylor's hand had removed those bails. So Thirrimane was run out and the match was tied.</p> <p>So here at last was a helter-skelter conclusion to a fine match. It was an unforgettable experience \u2013 not for all the right reasons \u2013 for Akila Dananjaya, the Sri Lankan \"mystery\" spinner, who was catapulted into the squad after impressing Mahela Jayawardene in the nets a few months ago. Dananjaya, a will-o'-the-wisp 18 year old from the southern suburbs of Colombo, was given his international debut.</p> <p>Dananjaya's third ball was driven by Martin Guptill straight into the hands of long-off; no problems with this international cricket. But he was less lucky with his 13th delivery. This time Rob Nicol cracked a straight drive with such power that the ball burst through the hands of Dananjaya before hitting the young man on the left cheek.</p> <p>Out came the physio amid much concern, but after a delay \u2013 a rare justified one in this tournament \u2013 Dananjaya pluckily completed his over without mishap before leaving the field. He returned soon after to finish his spell and he gained some sort of revenge by having Nicol caught at deep midwicket.</p> <p>Nicol had batted well, cracking three sixes in one over from Ajantha Mendis. So too had Guptill and Brendon McCullum, who against the odds would have two knocks on a balmy, chaotic evening.</p>",
  "<p>Red squirrels have been wiped out from a large swath of northern Italy, threatening a further biodiversity crisis for the species on a par with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/05/red-grey-squirrels-cornwall\" title=\"\">its near extinction in the British Isles</a>.</p> <p>There are now no red squirrels left in an area of more than 1,150 square kilometres (sq km) in Piedmont, according to research from the universities of Turin, Genoa and Varese. On the edge of this large region, the species is also under threat from the incursions of grey squirrels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396793500\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348757006163/Grey-squirrel-spread-and--001.jpg\" alt=\"Grey squirrel spread and red squirrel extinction\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grey squirrel spread and red squirrel extinction in Piedmont</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the spread of the grey squirrel continues unchecked, the species could spread as far as France, the scientists fear. They are calling for more research and control and conservation measures aimed at preserving the remaining red squirrel populations and containing the spread of the greys.</p> <p>Grey squirrels were introduced into Italy relatively recently, in 1948. They were a gift from the US ambassador and kept in Turin, but escaped into the wild and rapidly colonised the surrounding area \u2013 despite warnings from the UK, where importing grey squirrels was forbidden from before the second world war, when the devastating effects of having imported greys in the 1880s had become clear.</p> <p>Grey squirrels are not only more aggressive than the native European red squirrel, which causes them to invade red-dominated areas and take over, but they also carry a deadly virus, the squirrel pox. While greys are largely immune to the virus, it is lethal to red squirrels, which typically die within one or two weeks of being infected.</p> <p>From only four animals in 1948, at Stupinigi near Turin, the greys spread rapidly in recent years. Until 1970 the distribution of greys was limited to the Stupinigi woods, occupying an area of about 12 sq km. By 1990 this area had expanded to more than 200 sq km, stretching mainly southwards into the Cuneo province.</p> <p>By 2000, grey squirrels occupied 900 sq km and this year, fresh research from the three universities shows that their distribution now extends to more than 2,000 sq km. In more than half of that area, the native reds have been entirely wiped out, and in the remainder they are under severe threat.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/27/161853675/army-seeks-to-curb-rising-tide-of-suicides\">US army has instigated a service-wide \"stand down\" today, Thursday 27 September</a>, so that soldiers can focus on suicide prevention training. In 2012, more soldiers have died from suicide than combat. The army isn't ignoring the problem and trying to be proactive. The same can be said for how the US deals with its veterans, which gives me pause for thought. </p> <p>When I left the British army, in 2010, I became a veteran \u2013 though that is barely recognised or relevant in the UK. You become a straightforward civilian, severed from your military past. But when I went to study in the US, I discovered my veteran status was enthusiastically acknowledged and lauded.</p> <p>During two years of graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin, I couldn't but notice the stark differences between the US and UK veteran systems and what that might indicate about each society. I met an ex-US army sergeant medic at university who'd served in Iraq. The government-sponsored GI bill paid all his tuition and for living expenses.</p> <p>Though amounts vary across states, on average it's worth $89,000 (\u00a360,000) for a four-year undergraduate degree. British veterans have access to the Enhanced Learning Credits Administration Service that offers from $4,500 to $9,000 (\u00a33,000 to \u00a36,000) to pursue higher education, but only for particular courses at limited UK universities.</p> <p>US veterans are also offered deals on home and small business loans, numerous discounts and a veteran ID card; in the UK, we don't even get one of those. The US system isn't without fault and its department of veteran affairs has been criticized for its slow reaction to PTSD and evidence of repetitive brain injuries. Rates of suicide for US veterans remain terribly high, and unemployment and homelessness persist.</p> <p>Still, there's undeniably more offered to and done for US veterans. Despite committing its military to the same follies of Iraq and Afghanistan, the UK appears less willing to support those it sent, once they've served their purposes and left the military. UK veteran services are minimalist to the point of contempt.</p> <p>It's not as simple, though, as the US having a better policy approach than the UK. It also involves the larger picture of how US society currently engages with its military.</p> <p>In his farewell address, President Dwight D Eisenhower famously warned of \"a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions\" having an influence that was \"economic, political, even spiritual\". Yet the US continues spending more on the military than the countries with the next 15 largest budgets combined. </p> <p>This will likely be reduced by upcoming fiscal deficit legislation \u2013 though many civilians adamantly oppose any form of military spending cuts. American society contains a startling martial element, which only seems to be increasing.</p> <p>Cycling around campus, I'd pass uniformed military heading to class. Serving British military do attend public universities but out of uniform, which makes sense to me. It's a jarring sight: digital-combat fatigues next to the liberal arts building. On domestic flights, uniformed military are invited to board first and are often applauded by fellow passengers.</p> <p>The public's treatment of today's military is primarily a result of guilt about how Vietnam veterans were appalling treated \u2013 often spat at no sooner had they left the plane that brought them back. Americans tend to make their feelings evident.</p> <p>A low point during my experience of graduate school was the immediate aftermath following Osama bin Laden's killing. The celebratory tone adopted by many Americans was deeply depressing: it failed to acknowledge and respect the destruction visited on Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of US actions post 9/11.</p> <p>Far wiser commentators than I have noted America's culture of violence. \"The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer,\" wrote English novelist DH Lawrence. This may go some way to explain the continuing rise of the military-industrial complex, resulting in big business, billions of dollars and increasing multitudes of civilian employees inextricably wed to military contracts. </p> <p>The clearest example of misplaced American attitudes towards the military and veterans is the phenomenon of being thanked for your service. There is a simple and short rebuke to this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I served in Iraq and Afghanistan. There's nothing I should or can be thanked for. Watch the news. Speak to an Iraqi or Afghan.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ultimately, I find myself conflicted over how veterans should be treated in light of what I've witnessed in the US. I believe British veterans are neglected. But I'm relieved the chances of being thanked for my service are extremely rare in the UK and that we don't have a burgeoning military-industrial complex.</p> <p>I'm also relieved that Armistice Day, in the UK, is generally a dignified and sedate occasion compared to the US equivalent of Memorial Day, in May \u2013 with bumper discounts at the local Ford dealer and glitzy television productions spinning heroic narratives about the military. As American writer James Baldwin said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Americans have the most remarkable ability to alchemize all bitter truths into an innocuous but piquant confection and to transform their moral contradictions into a proud decoration, such as are given for heroism on the field of battle.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I believe simple approaches are best. On this year's Memorial Day, a friend said she planned email her Vietnam veteran uncle and tell him she was thinking about him. </p> <p>Did that suffice? Only the uncle could say, but I'd hazard a guess it was enough.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Title:</strong> On Location</p> <p><strong>Date: </strong>1977</p> <p><strong>The set up:</strong> You always got the feeling with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/21/phyllis-diller\" title=\"\">Phyllis Diller</a>, right up until her death last month, that even when there was no audience around, maybe while she was having a light lunch at home, that she'd be sat there wisecracking at the salt and pepper. That was the feeling you were meant to get. But it wasn't so.</p> <p>Diller started standup late, in 1955, aged 37, with five children to look after and no clue what she was doing. Gradually and carefully, however, she surrounded herself with a team of gag writers (though she still wrote most herself) and crafted a flamboyantly eccentric stage persona. The idea was, she was the ultimate fishwife, married to a man she knew as \"Fang\" (originally \"old fang-face\"), with a fat mother-in-law, a slutty sister and various other lowlifes in her extended family. Thus armed, she could go for hours: \"When I was born, I was so damn ugly the doctor slapped my mother\"; \"I was 30 years old, my mother was still trying to have an abortion\"; \"They had to hang a pork chop around my neck to make the dog play with me\". And so on.</p> <p>And if uninterrupted joke-telling is the package, what kind of character delivers it? Not anybody normal, that's for sure. So despite fixing her long nose with plastic surgery, Diller took great trouble to make herself look strange on stage with a variety of props and mini-dresses. \"I must always show my legs,\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOt7JgLl62c&amp;feature=fvwrel\" title=\"\">she explained</a>.</p> <p>\"My legs are funny. They're part of the persona.\" She even wore boots she had designed to meet her ankles at the skinniest point \"to make my legs look like toothpicks\". The famous cigarette-holder was just a wooden prop \"to show hostility\", and as a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f1XnYYEPDQ&amp;feature=relmfu\" title=\"\">pretext for keeping her right hand raised</a> to hold attention. \"It's subliminal, but it works.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-f1XnYYEPDQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-f1XnYYEPDQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f1XnYYEPDQ&amp;feature=relmfu\" title=\"\">Reading this on mobile? Watch the clip here</a></p> <p><strong>Funny how?</strong> Tell joke, laugh, tell joke, roll eyes, tell joke, grimace, tell joke \u2026 You get the idea. Can it be said that every single one of Diller's many, many punchlines was a zinger? It cannot. But some sure are. \"We stayed at such a cheap motel, they stole towels from us,\" for example. And in any case, watching Diller is like listening to bebop jazz. A certain tuned-in state of mind is called for to make the most of it, as she attacks each theme like a virtuoso, from every angle.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgD8kFla0t8#t=24m54s\" title=\"\">On Fang's mother</a>, for example: \"The only reason she wasn't on Noah's Ark's because they couldn't find another animal that looked like her \u2026 God, she's old. Her social security number is two\u2026 Great big fat old bat. Some day I'd like to split her girdle and watch her spread to death \u2026 She was so big she could only play Seek \u2026 She was born on the 8, 9 and 10 of June.\" Get on a roll, maybe when you're not completely sober, and this stuff is sublime.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YgD8kFla0t8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YgD8kFla0t8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgD8kFla0t8#t=24m54s\" title=\"\">Reading this on mobile? Watch the clip here</a></p> <p>It's also old-fashioned. Let's not hide from that. There's pretty much nobody left alive who still does comedy this way. Even that sassy, brassy showbiz accent of hers \u2013 kind of Carole Lombard, kind of Katherine Hepburn \u2013 has now died out. (As has the notion that it was acceptable to interrupt your sets with non-comic turns on the piano.)</p> <p>But Diller remains funny. She was ridiculous in 1960, and she's ridiculous now. This show was recorded in 1977, the year that she turned 60, and the audience nearly asphyxiate themselves with laughing. It's often said that Diller was a pioneer for women in comedy, but you could watch standups for another half a century and still never see another one like her.</p> <p><strong>Comic cousins:</strong> Bob Hope, Joan Rivers, Bob Monkhouse, Tim Vine, Groucho Marx</p> <p><strong>Steal this:</strong> \"I've got to tell you about this girl. She had the biggest boobs you've ever seen. She was a hunchfront.\"</p>",
  "<p>What does it take to get you out of bed in the morning when your in tray is piled sky high with the woes of the planet?</p> <p>Guardian Sustainable Business chairman Jo Confino did his best to get up close and personal with the panel at last week's quarterly debate on the challenges of staying positive in the face of adversity.</p> <h2>Fish stocks and the health of the oceans</h2> <p>Peter Hajipieris, director of sustainable and external affairs at frozen food giant Birds Eye Iglo, was bursting with positivity. This despite the fact that 30% of his company's business is frozen fish, and scientists have warned that the world's fish stocks are rapidly depleting.</p> <p>Confino asked him: \"With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/cod-pass-notes-3248?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">only 120 'old' cod in the North Sea</a>, what's it like to work in an industry where the global situation is so dire? When you look at what your company does and what you personally do against the challenge, do you ever go home and think, 'in 20 years there may not be a fish business'?\"</p> <p>Hajipieris, however, is a man who sees the oceans as half full rather than half empty. The Pacific Ocean alone is 64m square miles, he points out \u2013 a vast expanse that together with the other oceans covers three quarters of the planet. \"We have to make the sea work,\" he says.</p> <p>But the key to staying focused and positive, he says, is to surround yourself with like-minded companies. \"We really believe in collaboration, including with our competitors. The challenges are much bigger than any one company or country. We get that. You have to choose your battles and decide where you can make a difference. We focus on the continuity of food supply.\"</p> <p>Confino persisted: \"But on a personal side, how do you manage yourself when you clearly see what's happening in the world? Do you ever switch from being hopeful to being pessimistic?\"</p> <p>No, Hajipieris said. \"I genuinely believe that the planet and humans have of way of balancing themselves, but the time scale is longer than we are used to ... I'm an eternal optimist. I don't give up. And if I did, we wouldn't have a food supply, and our consumers depend on that.\"</p> <p>However, there were moments of frustration, especially when the company's efforts were misreported in the media, he added.</p> <h2>How to influence other companies</h2> <p>Edward Butt, vice-president of sustainability at Tate &amp; Lyle, was somewhat more introspective. \"The sustainability professional needs a certain skill set,\" he said. \"One has to be able to influence people when you may not have direct control or seniority over them. You have to work through the company, try to align your sustainability objectives with their objectives, such as increasing sales in a sustainable part of the business.\"</p> <p>\"But do you ever feel that you are pushing a rock up a hill?\" Confino asked. \"That people are stuck in an old way of doing things?\"</p> <p>Butt said it was easier to push a sustainability message when you are selling to other businesses instead of consumers. He pointed out that Tate &amp; Lyle now supplies the food industry \u2013 having sold its sugar and golden syrup brands two years ago.</p> <p>\"Most consumers don't buy green. It's the same thing with socially responsible investment. It's a niche market. But if you are supplying the likes of Tesco and Walmart, they get sustainability. If they don't have sustainability of supply, in 25 years, they won't be here. It makes it an easier job.\"</p> <p>He said big businesses' awareness of sustainability had increased dramatically over the past 10 to 15 years. \"It could be argued that business is now giving more leadership than government.\"</p> <h2>Focusing on achievements</h2> <p>John Revess, director of sustainability for packaging company Rexam, said the strides made in sustainability over the past 20 years, with lighter materials and a tripling of recycling rates, helped motivate him.</p> <p>\"We face challenges, and internally it's never easy, but we are all catalysts for change. Business as usual is not what we do. For me looking back over time and seeing we are making progress makes me feel good.\"</p> <p>Confino asked whether the same pace of change could be kept up, or whether the \"low-hanging fruit\" had already been picked.</p> <p>Revess said he had faith in human ingenuity. \"There will be new materials, new ways of using those materials, and new supply chains that will allow us to deliver sustainability targets. Continuous improvement never finishes.\"</p> <p>But would it be enough to meet the scale of the challenge, Confino persisted, citing rising sea levels and the catastrophic impacts of climate change forecast to be around the corner. Was wholesale change of the system now required to avert disaster?</p> <p>Revess quoted the Serenity Prayer: \"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference\", saying he could not do anything to stop the melting of the ice cap. \"I accept that. My job is to deliver within my sphere of influence of the packaging we produce, deliver food to consumers with less impact on the planet.\"</p> <p>Butt agreed: \"For me, sustainability is a journey. You can't manage everything every day but you can chop it up into pieces and work on those pieces. If you are motivated by an environmental ethic, as I am, there will be ups and downs, but it's about challenging yourself and your colleagues to keep going and take one step at a time.\"</p> <h2>Speak to people in their own language</h2> <p>Ian Hill, chief sustainability officer at BT's broadband supplier, Openreach, said sustainability professionals could have an impact if they used the right language for their audience and spoke to people on their own terms. It was important not to focus too much on the word \"sustainability\" itself, he said.</p> <p>\"What matters to people [in the company] is their own safety and the fact that they are connecting communities.\" Similarly, customers want services. \"The fact that we are doing something that lowers their carbon footprint is welcome, but not a focus.\"</p> <p>There was a suggestion from the audience that the views of young people, who would be most affected by the changes of the planet, should be taken on board to shake companies out of complacency.</p> <p>Revess said: \"Young people may be angry but they aren't doing very much about it when it comes to building a recycling society. It's the middle-aged people who are making sure they recycle things at home.\"</p> <h2>Time to take risks</h2> <p>To wind up, Confino asked what risk the panellists would be prepared to take to bring about a step-change at their companies.</p> <p>Hajipieris said he would take most of the marketing budget and spend it on advertising its sustainability efforts. Hill suggesting putting more of the operational budget into research. Revess wanted to set more visionary targets that would require a leap in innovation to achieve, such as those set by Unilever or Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Butt said: \"I think the best idea came from the floor today. I'd have some young people come into some board meetings and see what happens.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The revival of right-to-buy was intended to herald a new era of home ownership for council tenants, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/20/right-to-buy-council-house-policy-fails\" title=\"\">recent figures have cast doubt</a> on the scheme's progress.

Click here to listen</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Toronto.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Alex Edkins, Hayden Menzies and Chris Slorach.</p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>METZ capitalise their name, telegraphing that they are LOUD. They are the latest signing to Sub Pop and have been touted as a flavour you might savour if, in the early 90s, you were listening to grunge not baggy or shoegaze, to the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAl3A2pYFhM\" title=\"\">Melvins</a> not the Mondays or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QewavB0hJcU\" title=\"\">Moose</a>. Their self-titled debut album, released next month, was produced by METZ with the help of Graham Walsh of fellow Toronto band Holy Fuck. They are a trio, and like some other such formations \u2013 Cream, say, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, or Nirvana \u2013 they hardly want for power. They have spent the last couple of years playing everywhere from skate shops to regular gig stages on tour with bands such as Mission of Burma, Death from Above 1979, Archers of Loaf and Mudhoney, the latter arguably the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNj7ZyZy7cw\" title=\"\">quintessential Sub Pop band</a>.</p> <p>They don't just bludgeon, though. METZ are Noise Plus \u2013 this isn't volume for its own sake. There is force here, yes, but there are textures and dynamics that you would normally expect to hear on an album in the experimental section of a record store \u2013 Alex Bonenfant, engineer for Crystal Castles, was also involved in the recording of METZ, and Alexander Hacke of Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten apparently approached Chris Slorach to enthuse about his bass tone. It is a very good tone.</p> <p>METZ are post-hardcore, and we say that without much knowledge of developments in that area since, well, hardcore. Have there been a spate of bands since Big Black who have taken Big Black to the next level? Our impression was that Big Black were so ultimate, everyone pretty much gave up. And as for the electric guitar, our understanding of it is that, Pantera and Slayer and their ilk took it as far it would go in one direction, and My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth took it right out there to the other furthest sonic extreme, and that since then \u2013 since circa the early 90s, funnily enough \u2013 nothing truly substantial has changed. We assumed all the radical adventurous work had been in hip-hop and dubstep. Radiohead made advances by being a rock band incorporating electronic elements, but theirs always felt like sideways, hybridising moves to us.</p> <p>METZ don't effect a revolution either, but they're one of the more impressive rock bands we've heard of late. We can hear in their music the influence of the Pixies as much as we can PiL. Negative Space lurches like a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpxFXz08bX0\" title=\"\">Camden indie band</a>. By thinking creatively, they produce interesting sounds, and even though computers were undoubtedly employed, really this is a rock band thinking on its feet and using bass/guitar/drums in novel ways. Vocally, it's Elvis by way of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WqOMPakGCg\" title=\"\">Alan Vega</a>. Headache could indeed conceivably induce a migraine with its torrent of treble, slices of cymbal and domineering drums. Get Off has the relentless drive of motorik: it's krautrock meets grunge (krautgrunge?), Neu! by way of Nirvana. Sad Pricks is an echo-fest, like something from Sun Studios via Seattle. Rats features an onslaught \u2013 an orchestra \u2013 of guitars while the singer approximates John Lydon caught between the fury of the Pistols and the abstract distress signals of PiL. Knife in the Water is a crush collision of Beatles melody and Big Black attack. Nausea features a bass riff so low it may loosen your bowels \u2013 no wonder Mr Neubaten liked it. Wasted is metal for Wire readers. And the Mule is cerebral even as it does your head in \u2013 it's murky, mighty and intense only without hard rock's macho imperative. If the post-punk era \u2013 the era of PiL, Gang of Four and Wire \u2013 had thrown up a metal band, they would have sounded like METZ.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"METZ bring the raw, early-90s hardcore sludge back with a vengeance\" \u2013 Impose.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> At last, a good new alternative/indie noise/metal band.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Achieve nirvana.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Replace Nirvana.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The self-titled debut album is released next month by Sub Pop.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Melvins, Dwarves, Nirvana, PiL.</p> <p><strong>Links: </strong><a href=\"http://metz.bandcamp.com\" title=\"\">metz.bandcamp.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Friday's new band:</strong> Goat.</p>",
  "<p>Last year, Muse frontman Matt Bellamy announced the band's sixth album would be a \"Christian gangsta-rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face-melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia\". It tells you something about Muse that it was hard to work out exactly how far his tongue was lodged in his cheek. For one thing, it's almost always difficult to work out how far Bellamy's tongue is lodged in his cheek, as when he told NME he believed in the theories of <a href=\"http://www.sitchin.com/\" title=\"\">Zecharia Sitchin</a>, whose big idea was that the human race had been genetically engineered by aliens from the planet Nibiru, or cancelled a series of US interviews on the grounds that he'd heard an asteroid was about to hit America. For another, if any currently extant major band were to be engaged in creating a Christian gangsta-rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face-melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia, it would probably be Muse. Comparisons are regularly made between their oeuvre and that of Queen, Rush and Radiohead: there's an argument that Muse are to pre-Kid A Radiohead what Meat Loaf circa Bat Out of Hell was to Bruce Springsteen. But none of them really capture the sheer level of trenchant preposterousness at which Muse operate. The most apposite comparison might be to say Muse have actually achieved what the Darkness set out to do: conquer the world with music that's clearly meant to be funny, but isn't supposed to be a joke.</p> <p>Indeed, it could be suggested that the only real giveaways to Bellamy's comic intent were that his bandmates were talking up their forthcoming album as a major sonic reboot \u2013 \"It's time to move on and do something radically different,\" suggested bassist Chris Wolstenholme \u2013 and that his description didn't actually sound that far removed from what Muse had done previously: they'd already achieved something best described as \"metal flamenco\" on 2006's Black Holes and Revelations. That said, anyone listening to Supremacy, the opening track of The 2nd Law, might wonder precisely how radical a reinvention Muse have undergone.</p> <p>The understated single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek0SgwWmF9w\" title=\"\">Madness</a> suggested a new stripped-back approach: there's not much to it beyond an electronic bassline, a decent pop song and Bellamy's vocal, which declines to unexpectedly burst into an ear-splitting falsetto (or scream), or proclaim the imminent arrival of the apocalypse, or indeed do any of the things he usually does within seconds of getting near a microphone. But clearly any discussions about toning it down a bit were shortlived. Supremacy's musical DNA is equal parts Led Zeppelin's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW_WLxseq0o\" title=\"\">Kashmir</a> and Wings' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR46gQLyxuE\" title=\"\">Live and Let Die</a>: its idea of restraint is to leave it a minute and a&#xa0;half before bringing the choir in. It should be noted that, Madness aside, The 2nd Law's lowest-key track is Animals, which concludes with what sounds like a recording of a riot in full swing.</p> <p>In fact, the most obvious sign of change on The 2nd Law is its incorporation of the kind of dubstep produced by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJVmu6yttiw\" title=\"\">Skrillex</a> and dismissed by its detractors as \"brostep\". It actually meshes with Muse's existing style remarkably well, perhaps because Muse and your average brostep producer are cut from the same cloth in at least one sense: neither of them has much interest in subtlety. Unsubtle or not, the concluding two-part title track \u2013 the most obviously brostep-indebted thing here \u2013 is thunderously exciting stuff, a boiling mass of fidgety strings, electronic voices and sub-bass&#xa0;wobble.</p> <p>This is obviously all great rollicking fun, but there are problems with The 2nd Law. You can see why the organisers thought Muse would be the right band to provide the official song of London 2012, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt__jKWoYH8\" title=\"\">Survival</a> didn't work \u2013 partly because it seems to have no tune whatsoever, but mostly because it didn't fit the event. The Olympics turned out to be as much about tiny human stories \u2013 from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1tduGQPJJw\" title=\"\">Chad le Clos's dad</a> to Kirani James and Oscar Pistorius swapping nametags \u2013 as epic spectacle. With their choirs, string-laden intro, hysterical vocals and lyrics you might characterise as a bit Ayn Randy \u2013 \"I chose to survive whatever it takes \u2026 vengeance is mine \u2026 Fight! Win!\" \u2013 Muse got the scale but missed the humanity. Six albums in, this is a recurring problem: amusing and enjoyable as the aural histrionics are, you do start to wonder what, if anything, they're trying to express, or if it's just bombast for bombast's sake.</p> <p>Occasionally, you get the sense the band's sound is actually antithetical to genuine emotional impact. Follow Me is a song about Bellamy's baby son: \"I&#xa0;will keep you safe, I will protect you, I won't let them harm you,\" he sings. He obviously means it, but delivered as it is, in a portentous voice that leaves teeth-marks on the scenery, to a backdrop of distorted dive-bombing bass (courtesy of co-producers Nero) and florid synthesiser arpeggios, it sounds like he doesn't. Similarly, it's hard to tell whether there's actual political conviction behind the title track's equation of the second law of thermodynamics with global economic collapse, or if it's just showy grandiloquence, a lyrical counterpart to one of Bellamy's more baroque guitar solos.</p> <p>None of this stops The 2nd Law from being a hugely entertaining album. Nor will it stop it being a vast success. After all, no one goes to see a blockbuster for its profundity and deep characterisation. They go for the stunts and the special effects, both of which The 2nd Law delivers.</p>",
  "<p>I have just rattled off a stiffly-worded email of complaint, for it has just dawned on me that it is now over a month since my lawnmower went in for repairs at the local garden machinery workshop. </p> <p>I have started converting a number of areas of lawn in my garden to flower-rich meadows, and my mower simply isn't designed for such work. I have let the meadow plants grow, flower and seed, and the resulting foot-high herbage is overpowering my machine. Wild flower meadow creation is not proving to be the walk in the park as described by the magazines.</p> <p>Problems aside, the developing grasslands have given me a great deal of pleasure. In an earlier posting I have mentioned the flourishing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/26/bee-orchid-lawns\">bee orchids</a> that occur naturally in the lawns here, but more exciting still has been the appearance of a single flowering <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/early_purple_orchid/\">early purple orchid</a> in a spot in which I scattered seed roughly four years ago. Another native beauty present is the greater burnet saxifrage (<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimpinella_major\">Pimpinella major</a></em>), something of a local speciality here to the east of Plymouth, and notable for its airy stems of queen anne's lace flowers that are so flawlessly white they gleam in the dark. And, of course, these flowers have attracted a wealth of insects: brown and blue butterflies in abundance, and bees galore.</p> <p>But one thing has outshone everything else, and that has been the yellow rattle (<em>Rhinanthus minor</em>). I love this plant for its strongly architectural structure and its burnished golden flowers, which look like tiny turtles hatching from their eggs. The plant has a more practical use, too, for it is a \"hemi-parasite\" - a partial parasite - and can be used to reduce the vigour of meadow grasses. Sure, it produces green leaves that photosynthesize, generating energy for plant growth from the sun's ray, but the rattle is happiest when its roots lock onto those of the grasses and suck the life out of them. Even out of flower, areas of meadow heavily invaded by this species support only the most meagre growth of grass: little wonder yellow rattle is loathed by farmers. </p> <p>It is loved, however, by those keen to establish a meadow grassland rich in flowers. It's important to reduce competition from coarse growing perennials, grasses included. This can be done by stripping nutrients from the soil \u2013 for example, by scraping off the overlying topsoil to reveal the poorer subsoil beneath \u2013 but yellow rattle achieves much the same results at considerably less cost and effort, and has become a mainstay within wild flower seed mixtures. </p> <p>If you want to introduce this species into your lawn, it's worth understanding the plant's ecology in the wild. It is an annual species that germinates in spring (typically March), flowers at the height of summer, and is in full seed a couple of months later (say, late August). As a strictly upright plant it cannot tolerate being cut or grazed off too severely during this period, so is most at home in old-fashioned hay meadows, where grazing is excluded during the summer months, and a late hay cut allows a good proportion of flowers to have successfully set seed. </p> <p>First cut your area of grass - think more of shaving a head to control nits, rather than a short back and sides \u2013 and collect and dispose of the clippings elsewhere. Sprinkle seeds very thinly over the scuffed turf: even a seed or two per metre is ample, for if the introduction is successful, the resulting plants will shower the ground with an abundance of fresh <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagule\">propagules</a> within the year. The seed is apparently short-lived, so sow it fresh in the late summer or autumn, and no later. You can cut as short and as often as you like through the winter and into spring, but by March, stop cutting, or at least raise the mower blades, for the seed should be germinating by then. You can probably get away with a final cut into early summer if you set the mower blades at their highest setting, for the youngsters will simply be encouraged to form a strong bushy plant if decapitated in their first month of growth. </p> <p>However, by mid May all mowing should cease, to allow the rattles to flower and seed. You'll know that the plant is mature and shedding ripe seed when the fruits take on a ghostly silvery-grey colour, and rattle when shaken: at this stage it looks rather like a poor man's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunaria_annua\">honesty</a>. </p> <p>Don't be too hasty to cut and remove the rattle-rich hay for the fruit ripens over a period of weeks, but when most of the seed heads have turned grey, it is a good time to pull up bunches of the plants, and to shake them over new lawn to encourage the large disc-shaped seeds to fall. With the last seed successfully shed, it's time to start that heavy mowing again. Which is, of course, why my mower is now struggling! Next year, I am going do my big end-of-year cut with a strimmer, and then rake and collect the cuttings by hand, before bringing out the mower.</p> <p>Yellow rattle seed is widely available to buy, but do check with the supplier that the seed is of local provenance. Six loosely defined subspecies of yellow rattle occur across Britain, reflecting differing geologies and habitats, so it would be tragic if we upset this balance through the introduction of non-native stock from the continent. Better still, you won't do any harm by taking just the smallest handful of seed from a natural population growing in a meadow close to your home, and use this to start your garden colony. Do make sure that you are removing only the tiniest proportion of seed from the wild colony, and check that the landowner is happy. </p> <p><em>Andy Byfield is one of the founders of the wild plant charity <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/\">Plantlife</a>.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 July to correct the image credit.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Morning everyone. A bit of a taster ahead of England's game with West Indies later today, and <strong>New Zealand will bat first</strong> this morning in Pallekele.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> TM Dilshan, DPMD Jayawardene*, KC Sangakkara\u2020, HDRL Thirimanne, AD Mathews, BMAJ Mendis, NLTC Perera, KMDN Kulasekara, SL Malinga, BAW Mendis, MKPAD Perera</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>New Zealand:</strong> MJ Guptill, JEC Franklin, BB McCullum\u2020, LRPL Taylor*, RJ Nicol, JDP Oram, DL Vettori, KS Williamson, NL McCullum, TG Southee, KD Mills</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>I say this morning, but it's the middle of the afternoon in Sri Lanka. New Zealand have won the toss for this Super Eight meeting and will have to withstand the onslaught from the likes of Lasith Malinga and Ajantha Mendis.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Dananjaya Perera makes his debut for Sri Lanka today. There's a lot of mystery around his spin.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>Blimey both national anthems took an absolute age.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>Here come the teams then, Martin Guptill and Rob Nicol to open the batting for New Zealand.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>Nuwan Kulasekara comes steaming in for the first over...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1st over: New Zealand 2-0 (Nicol 1, Guptill 1)</strong> Immediate appeal for lbw against Nicol from Kulasekara's first delivery! But he had planted his foot a good stride forward and the ball hit him outside the line, although it would have gone on to hit middle stump. Nicol flicks one off his legs to get off the mark and put Guptill on strike for the first time. Kulasekara is getting plenty of swing out there and gazumps the batsman with his next effort, the ball almost played on by Guptill. However, he gets going with a single. Excellent first over.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2nd over: New Zealand 4-0 (Nicol 2, Guptill 2)</strong> Angelo Matthews is handed the white orb under the Pallekele sun. Kumar Sangakkara comes up to the stumps as Guptill guides one down to third man for a single. Nicol on the back foot plays one to mid-off and charges down the wicket, making it despite a hopeful shy at the stumps. The movement in the air is causing Guptill a few problems as he plays and misses twice in the corridor of uncertainty. Another fine over and Sri Lanka have started brilliantly.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3rd over: New Zealand 17-0 (Nicol 2, Guptill 13)</strong> Kulasekara opens with a wide down the leg side before swinging one into Nicol's pads, a single going into the extras column. Guptill suddenly decides enough is and starts letting the willow fly. He smacks a full delivery over the bowlers head, the ball bouncing just before the boundary line and four runs added to the New Zealand tally. Guptill gets a wee bit excited by that though and attempts an audacious flick over mid-on, only to toe it slightly and find Perera who leaps high ... but he can't quite hold onto it! Guptill punishes Sri Lanka by guiding another to the third man boundary. That's more like it for the Kiwis.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4th over: New Zealand 26-0 (Nicol 6, Guptill 18)</strong> Lasith Malinga is thrown into the attack and slings one into Guptill, who expertly turns it past square leg for another four. Jayawardene has decided that he wants a wicket to prevent these openers forming a partnership and despite that early boundary, Malinga's variation of pace is causing Nicol a few problems. He wants to get Guptill back on strike but can't pick the slower balls. Just as I say that he clips one off his legs, over backward square leg, for four. That'll help his confidence.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5th over: New Zealand 36-0 (Nicol 7, Guptill 27)</strong> Ajantha Mendis is brought into the attack with Jayawardene mixing it up again. But it's a pretty tame over from him, with Guptill and Nicol playing the ball around comfortably for ones and twos. Terrible fielding from Malinga at short third man, who wangs one in at the stumps only to miscue completely and cost his side two overthrows. Guptill then ends the over with a fine cut through the off side. New Zealand getting a foothold in this game now.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>6th over: New Zealand 43-0 (Nicol 8, Guptill 33)</strong> The conditions are absolutely perfect for batting out there. There was a bit of early swing but that seems to have disappeared for now and the sun is beating overhead on a relatively new pitch that looks settled. Malinga comes in once again though and flummoxes Guptill with a slower delivery. They are pitching it pretty short to Guptill and he knows that, advancing down the pitch to swat Malinga back over his head for four. Still no wicket.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>7th over: New Zealand 55-0 (Nicol 15, Guptill 38)</strong> Oh dear, it's a handful of fresh air for Malinga down at third man. Angelo Matthews won't be happy with that as Guptill directs one behind square, the spin catching Malinga flat-footed and bouncing behind him over the boundary. Dilshan shows Malinga how it's done though, charging from deep mid-wicket across to the square leg boundary, where his dive saves a certain four. New Zealand have the bit between their teeth now and Nicol is even in on the act, thumping one down the ground for another four.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 57-1 (Guptill c Perera b Dananjaya 38)</strong></p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>The new boy gets his wicket as Guptill, who has batted so confidently, miscues a doosra and his leading edge flies all the way to long off. That's the breakthrough.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8th over: New Zealand 59-1 (Nicol 17, McCullom 1)</strong> Brendon McCullum comes to the crease on his 31st birthday and he is basically coming in blind against this bowler. Excellent opening over from Dananjaya, full of variation and unpredictability.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>9th over: New Zealand 68-1 (Nicol 24, McCullom 3)</strong> Sri Lanka persist with the spin as Jeevan Mendis trots up to the crease. McCullom is in a bit of pain out there, it looks as though he's got a little back strain, but tries to fight away the pain with a thwack down the ground. Nicol on strike again and he charges down the pitch and lifts one over long-on for the first six of the match!</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>10th over: New Zealand 80-1 (Nicol 25, McCullom 12)</strong> Dananjaya attempts a leg spinner with his first delivery of the over but it's a full toss that McCullom dispatches for another six, over the long on boundary! That wasn't as emphatic as the last but it's more runs on the board. The Kiwis are taking the attack to this young lad, who has been dealt a bit of a reality check after his first six balls. McCullom is beginning to score freely and putting the home side under real pressure.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11th over: New Zealand 89-1 (Nicol 31, McCullom 17)</strong> Excellent shot from Nicol off Mendis, he's really finding his groove after a slow start. Mendis drops one in a tad short and he sweeps it with pace between the fielders to the mid-wicket boundary. Sri Lanka need another wicket desperately here as McCullom swings and smacks another down the leg side, but that's only a single that is stopped acrobatically by the fielder on the rope.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11.1 overs: New Zealand 89-1 (Nicol 31, McCullom 17)</strong> Dananjaya has caught a stinger right in the face. Nicol smacked the ball back at the young spinner, and it came on too quickly for him to get hands to it, hitting him just below the eye. That's going to hurt. A dropped catch says the commentator!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12th over: New Zealand 99-1 (Nicol 33, McCullom 25)</strong> Dananjaya picks himself up and with cotton wool stuffed up his nose, trots in again. His next delivery is a full toss that Nicol hits hard, but this time Dilshan scuttles across to prevent a four at long-on. Both McCullom and Nicol are trying to attack this young spinner, and the former charges down the wicket to smack an absolute beast for six over wide long-off.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 99-2 (McCullom c Perera b A Mendis 25)</strong></p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>McCullom is caught on the square leg boundary, 25 off 16 deliveries for the birthday boy. Decent little knock though.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>13th over: New Zealand 104-2 (Nicol 37, Taylor 1)</strong> Ross Taylor strides out into the middle and he gets off the mark with a single from his first ball. Five runs and a wicket from the over from A Mendis, and that could give Sri Lanka some momentum with seven overs remaining.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>14th over: New Zealand 109-2 (Nicol 38, Taylor 4)</strong> J Mendis keeps it tight at the other end, and he goes for three runs with one leg by from the first five deliveries. Taylor gets a couple from the final ball, though, but that is still an excellent over. New Zealand are going to start hitting out soon one feels.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>15th over: New Zealand 133-2 (Nicol 57, Taylor 7)</strong> A Mendis gets hit for successive sixes through mid-wicket, and Nicol goes to 50! That will hurt Sri Lanka and Nicol, despite a slow start to his innings, has played quite brilliantly. He cuts one to the cover boundary to get another couple before replicating the same shot over mid-wicket for another six! Ding dang doo! Mendis is rattled here and he sends a wild one almost off the pitch \u2013 that's a wide and off the final ball Nicol gets another couple. 24 from the over, disastrous for Sri Lanka!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>15.4 overs: New Zealand 137-2 (Nicol 58, Taylor 9)</strong> Dananjaya, still carrying the battle scars following that earlier incident, comes at Taylor round the wicket and while the batsman doesn't launch him over the boundary rope, he keeps the score ticking over.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 137-3 (Nicol c Thirimanne b Dananjaya 58)</strong></p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>It's a second wicket for Dananjaya and an end to Nicol's excellent innings. Caught comfortably at deep square leg after ballooning his shot skyward.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>16th over: New Zealand 141-3 (Taylor 13, Oram 0)</strong> So Dananjaya ends an eventful afternoon with the ball with a key wicket. Gutsy effort from him after getting hit in the face earlier. Jacob Oram comes in now.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>17th over: New Zealand 149-3 (Taylor 19, Oram 2)</strong> Oram is a bit too keen to get off the mark and is sent swiftly back by Taylor after calling for a ridiculous single. Malinga is slinging them in at a full length and New Zealand are struggling to get anything bar ones and twos. The commentator's curse strikes again as Taylor flicks expertly off his legs for four. Jayawardene has an opportunity for a run out with Oram struggling ... but his throw in to Malinga is poor.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 154-4 (Taylor b Kulasekara 23)</strong></p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>Excellent slower ball from Kulasekara, out of the back of his hand and that hits Taylor's leg stump. Big wicket.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>17.5 overs: New Zealand 159-4 (Oram 6, N McCullum 1)</strong> More tight stuff from Kulasekara until Oram loops one skyward with one hand on the bat ... but it lands safe and that's four.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 159-5 (Oram c Dilshan b Kulasekara 6)</strong></p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>Dilshan makes the catch look simple at the long-off boundary and Sri Lanka will be delighted with this, two new men in at the death. Excellent over from Kulasekara.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>18.5 overs: New Zealand 164-5 (N McCullum 3, Franklin 2)</strong> Well the momentum has certainly shifted Sri Lanka's way in these late overs. The crowd are a lot more lively and the players are chirpy in the field now. The batsmen are backing away from Malinga, who slings a wide down the off side.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 164-6 (N McCullum b Malinga 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>An inswinging yorker does for McCullum, and this has turned into a terrible finish for the Kiwis. They are still going to post a decent score, but it could have been so much more.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>19.5 overs: New Zealand 173-6 (Franklin 8, Williamson 3)</strong> Kulasekara with the final over but his first delivery is a full toss and dispatched down the ground for four by Franklin. New Zealand are edging towards the 180 mark but might just fall short, Sri Lanka with some excellent, sharp, fielding...</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 173-6 (Williamson run out 4)</strong></p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>20th over: New Zealand 174-7</strong> So Williamson is run out on the last ball of the innings, as the Kiwis looked to come back for an unlikely second, Sangakkara with plenty of time to remove the bails.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Sri Lanka need 175 runs to win</strong></p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>Here come the teams for the second innings, with Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan opening the batting for Sri Lanka.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>1st over: Sri Lanka 17-0 (Jayawardene 1, Dilshan 16)</strong> Wow. Nathan McCullom has taken some serious treatment in that first over. 17 on the board after just six balls! Dilshan hits a four and then a huge six through mid-wicket, before smacking McCullom over his head for another boundary! Well Sri Lanka aren't wasting any time are they? What intent from Dilshan!</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Sri Lanka 20-0 (Jayawardene 3, Dilshan 17)</strong> Kyle Mills is handed the white orb, which has already taken a severe bruising! He keeps things much tighter than McCullom, though, with Jayawardene looking to work quick singles around the square. Oh no! More pain for McCullom and this time it's physical! The New Zealander is mowed down by Dilshan who was scampering to make the one, going backside up before crashing to the turf. Meanwhile, there was just three from that over.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Sri Lanka 31-0 (Jayawardene 12, Dilshan 19)</strong> Unsurprisingly, McCullom is withdrawn from the attack and replaced by Tim Southee. He charges in and his first delivery is just a fraction off line, with Jayawardene nonchalantly *clipping* him for six over square leg. Staggering shot that. More singles to follow and Sri Lanka have started with real purpose. The Black Caps are still reeling from that disastrous first over to be honest, and need to break this early partnership.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 43-0 (Jayawardene 23, Dilshan 20)</strong> Superb drive from Jayawardene through the covers, expertly timed and Mills is cursing himself. The next delivery is a dot but there is more pain to follow for New Zealand, Jayawardene slapping Mills for a flat six with another superb stroke. The Sri Lanka captain is leading from the front and at this stage the Kiwis were 26-0. In pursuit of 175, you've got to fancy Sri Lanka's chances right now.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5th over: Sri Lanka 62-0 (Jayawardene 30, Dilshan 31)</strong> Southee continues but it's a filthy opening ball, way too short and Dilshan wallops another six over leg side. Southee is rattled and drops in a short one, but that's over the batsman's head and signaled as a wide. Sri Lanka are really punishing the Black Caps here, and they look lost for answers. Dilshan cuts through the off side for four, timed to perfection once again. The sun is slowly setting over Pallekele, and as it fades away so do New Zealand's chances. They need a flurry of wickets, and fast. Alas, Jayawardene lifts Southee over cow corner with consummate ease. Blimey, this is how to bat in T20, wonderful stuff and 19 from the over.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>6th over: Sri Lanka 68-0 (Jayawardene 34, Dilshan 33)</strong> Jacob Oram comes into the attack and is looking to slow the run rate with some solid line and length. However, while he is successful in that regard, it is wickets that the Kiwis need now. Sri Lanka can take their foot off the gas and start looking for singles and just rotating the strike. The batsmen have certainly stopped going big, time is on their side and they are comfortable.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>7th over: Sri Lanka 76-0 (Jayawardene 40, Dilshan 35)</strong> Daniel Vettori enters the action and is charged with restoring some calm to the game. Jayawardene has his eye in though, and is seeing it like a beach ball, sweeping Vettori past square leg for four. A rare miscue from Jayawardene he sends an airborne drive through the off side, but it is safe and Sri Lanka run another couple. The result seems a formality right now, but they still need another 100 runs.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 80-1 (Jayawardene c Vettori b Oram 44)</strong></p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>Jayawardene had just guided Oram down to third man for four, but he is not happy himself for conceding his wicket, top edging down to wide fine leg where Vettori gratefully claimed an easy catch. Game on.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>8th over: Sri Lanka 85-1 (Dilshan 40, Sangakkara 0)</strong> Sangakkara comes to the crease but it is Dilshan on strike after the batsmen crossed during Jayawardene's dismissal. He hits another four and Sri Lanka only need 90 to win now. Still, that wicket has made it a bit more interesting.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>9th over: Sri Lanka 92-1 (Dilshan 42, Sangakkara 5</strong> Sangakkara gets off the mark and he can take his time to just play himself in, but Vettori is certainly asking a few questions, as the Sri Lanka wicket-keeper nervously pats one almost within reach of the bowler. If that was cautious, though, there were no signs of nerves in his next shot, a short delivery dispatched with a fine pull to the mid-wicket boundary. More runs to the score.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>10th over: Sri Lanka 103-1 (Dilshan 44, Sangakkara 14)</strong> Sangakkara is in a hurry out there, that's for sure, wafting at a few wide-ish deliveries from Oram. But a short ball is expertly pulled for another four. That's poor bowling and it's another long-hop next up, once again swatted to the boundary. Filth from Oram.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>11th over: Sri Lanka 113-1 (Dilshan 48, Sangakkara 19)</strong> Even the skills of Daniel Vettori can't keep Sri Lanka down. Some good bowling is treated with disrespect by Sangakkara, launching him over extra cover for four. Their current run-rate is 10.27, with 6.89 the required rate for victory. To say they are coasting to the win would be an understatement.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>12th over: Sri Lanka 118-1 (Dilshan 50, Sangakkara 21)</strong> Nathan McCullum comes back into the New Zealand attack, let's hope his over is an improvement on the opening six balls. Only five runs from it so that's definitely better, but I think it's more down to the fact that Sri Lanka have purposely slowed things down. Dilshan takes a single after knocking one to mid-on, and that brings up his 50 off 32 balls.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 119-2 (Sangakkara run out 21)</strong></p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p>Sangakkara is run out after great work from Brendan McCullom behind the stumps, following a sloppy throw from deep mid-wicket. That's excellent wicket-keeping.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>13th over: Sri Lanka 122-2 (Dilshan 50, J Mendis 2)</strong> Jeevan Mendis joins Dilshan in the middle and these two will now look to steer Sri Lanka to a steady victory. Only four from the over from James Franklin, so New Zealand are at least making a game of it.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>14th over: Sri Lanka 126-2 (Dilshan 54, J Mendis 4)</strong> McCullum continues but despite a few short and wide-ish balls, Sri Lanka are looking a little bit concerned. The Black Caps are looking to keep Mendis on strike and suddenly this is creeping to a close finish. Perhaps I spoke too soon when claiming the game was already won.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>14.4 overs: Sri Lanka 126-2 (Dilshan 54, J Mendis 4)</strong> Poor, poor bowling from Franklin, who sends down a long-hop that Mendis pulls for four.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 131-3 (J Mendis c Taylor b Franklin 8)</strong></p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>Mendis smacks one into the covers but that's an excellent catch from Taylor going forward.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>15th over: Sri Lanka 133-3 (Dilshan 54, Matthews 1)</strong> The scores are level at 133 from 15 overs! That's pretty remarkable in itself after Sri Lanka's start. Angelo Matthews is at the crease now.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>16th over: Sri Lanka 137-3 (Dilshan 58, Matthews 3)</strong> Dilshan has played a fantastic innings here, still in after opening with such conviction. Vettori with another tight over, but the wicket of Dilshan is paramount to New Zealand's chances. Get him out and we could be in for a barnstorming finish.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>17th over: Sri Lanka 147-3 (Dilshan 64, Matthews 7)</strong> Fantastic shot, yet again from Dilshan, driving Franklin wide of long-off for another boundary. New Zealand are looking to keep Matthews on strike but he's no slouch with the willow in hand, swiping a full ball down to long on for a single. The atmosphere is ratcheting up inside the ground and captain Jayawardene is beginning to look nervous in the dugout. Sri Lanka need 28 to win off 18 balls.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>18th over: Sri Lanka 154-3 (Dilshan 69, Matthews 9)</strong> \"You don't want to mess it up here,\" announces Tony Greig in the commentary box. Sage advice from him, as Tim Southee charges in with Taylor constantly tinkering with his field. Dilshan gets a single off the first delivery, as does Matthews from the following ball. Southee bangs one in the blockhole, Dilshan digs it out into mid-wicket and they come back for two, Guptill's throw missing the stumps with Matthews already safe. An excellent over from Southee, this, not conceding a boundary and leaving Sri Lanka needing more than 10 an over with 12 balls remaining.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>18.1 overs: Sri Lanka 159-3 (Dilshan 69, Matthews 9)</strong> There's a lot of pressure on James Franklin here and his first ball is a terrible full toss which Dilshan smashes for six at cow corner! The next delivery is cut away to backward point and they come back for two, excellent throw for Southee. Run-out chance! This is going upstairs...</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 161-4 (Dilshan run-out 76)</strong></p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p>That's an absolutely crucial wicket! Dilshan doesn't make it back for a second and credit to Southee with an excellent throw. This ain't over yet...</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>18.5 overs: Sri Lanka 167-4 (Matthews 10, Perera 5)</strong> Thick outside edge from Perera flies down to the third man boundary for four. That was lucky, but the home side won't care.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 167-5 (Perera b Franklin 5)</strong></p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>Great slower ball from Franklin and it's eight required off the last over for Sri Lanka!</strong></p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p>Southee has the honour of the last over...</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>19.3 overs: Sri Lanka 170-5 (Matthews 12, Thirimanne 1)</strong> Southee is sending them in full and that's a crucial dot ball. Five runs from two balls required!</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>19.5 overs: Sri Lanka 174-5 (Matthews 12, Thirimanne 5)</strong> Wonderful shot from Thirimanne! Shuffling over to the off side and scooping it to fine leg for four! The scores are level!</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p>Run-out opportunity on the last ball! But Thirimanne looks safe!

  "<p>You can't accuse them of not putting in the hours. Third-person survival horror <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/games/resident-evil-6/ps3-85710\" title=\"\"><strong>Resident Evil 6</strong></a> (PS3/Xbox 360) contains not one single-player campaign but four, each of which is nearly as large on its own as the entirety of Resident Evil 5. Each of the game's campaigns follows a different hero and, to an extent, emphasises a different style of play, from the puzzle-solving, exploration and jumpiness of the original Resident Evil to the heavily armed gun-slinging and fiendish mutant freakazoids of later titles.</p> <p>It's not short of multiplayer depth, either. Three of the four campaigns can be played co-operatively by two players, while in sections where the campaign stories intertwine two pairs of players can team up online to work together. Factor in a whole new online game mode and the return of the much-loved Mercenaries mini-game and this looks like a sequel set to totally eclipse its predecessors. To which the obvious response is: \"Fine, it's big. But is it going to be any good?\"</p> <p>The answer will depend a lot on what you want from a modern horror game. And, if you've not got the time or patience to play through all four adventures, on whose story you decide to play. Players looking for the more traditional, old-school Resident Evil experience \u2013 a tense and eery tiptoe, punctuated by sharp shocks, and giving way only occasionally to out-and-out action \u2013 will find returning heroes Leon and Ada's campaigns most to their tastes. They'll have to start with Leon's, though, since to play as the uber-cool Ada you must first complete the other three.</p> <p>Leon's story begins with an old man lumbering towards him dribbling blood. A second or two in, we realise this old man is the American president. Or was, at least, because now he's really just a zombie in a very sharp suit. And when he lumbers towards mysterious stranger Helena with the very clear intention of biting her neck off, it falls to Leon to shoot the president in the head. Which he duly does, prompting Helena to announce that this is all her fault: a statement she'll explain after Leon escorts her to the local cathedral, where she has left her big expository PowerPoint presentation.</p> <p>Thus begins a very linear trek through the streets, sewers and cemeteries of the zombie apocalypse. In fact, two hours in, there has barely been a single decision to make, beyond which of the zombies lumbering towards you to shoot first, and whether to kill them all or just kick a couple over and then leg it past them. It would be far too much to expect four intertwining stories to be player-driven, but at times the game feels like a film being interrupted occasionally by a gamer, to the annoyance of its director.</p> <p>That filmic quality comes into its own in the more action-oriented campaigns. Some of the game's bigger battles are breathtaking, particularly special forces member Chris's war of attrition with a two-storey nightmare giant, while there's a Hitchcock-esque tension to new boy Jake's relentless pursuit by the bloodthirsty Ustanak, an unpleasant lump of raw pain and horror determined on sampling Jake's rare blood-type in the least scientific fashion possible.</p> <p>In gameplay terms, it's fairly vanilla third-person fare: aim over the shoulder, shoot, occasionally pop a pill to replenish your health, and when the bad guys start getting too close, kick, punch and shove to keep them away. Quick-time events \u2013 of the \"Mash A now!\" variety \u2013 provide a way to wriggle out of zombie bites, tentacles and other assorted unpleasantness, and are scattered liberally through the game's many cut-scenes. The allied AI is another nice touch: when playing a co-op campaign alone, the computer acts as a reliable buddy, reviving you when downed and doling out a decent amount of damage on its own.</p> <p>Sadistic players seeking more of a challenge may also get a kick out of the new Agent Hunter mode, in which gamers who have finished the campaign can, with permission, drop into other people's online sessions as one of the local baddies normally controlled by the computer. Those playing as the agents themselves will be at a serious advantage, but there's surely a sick kind of satisfaction to be had in attempting to outfox and chow down on a real human player.</p> <p>In short, there looks to be enough variety in Resident Evil 6 to satisfy even the most jaded returning fan, and for newcomers to horror gaming's finest franchise, there's never been a meatier first bite.</p>",
  "<p>Early in August, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-08-02/immigration-prison/56689394/1\">reported</a> that America's three largest private prison companies, the <a href=\"http://thecca360.com/\">Corrections Corporation of America</a> (CCA), GEO Group, Inc and Management and Training Corp spent in the region of $45m over the past 10 years in lobbying state and federal governments. During the same period, these companies saw their profits soar as they scored more government contracts.</p> <p>During the same period, various pieces of legislation got passed ensuring that immigrant detention, in particular, would remain a lucrative growth market. The companies get defensive, however, if anyone attempts to draw a connection between their lobbying efforts and their booming businesses. But whatever the purpose of the lobbying, the very fact that these companies, which perform a public service using taxpayer funds, are first and foremost profit-making entities highlights the flawed incentivisation of the private prison model and its growing presence in the American criminal justice system.</p> <p>I'll get to the lobbying in a moment, but first let's have a look at that flawed incentive. Thanks to mandatory sentencing laws and the \"war on drugs\", the prison population has exploded over the past 30 years \u2013 to the point where it has become an untenable burden on state budgets. As a result, many state lawmakers have begun to look at ways to reduce their prison populations. This is good for society, as needlessly locking people up for excessive periods for nonviolent crimes has proven to be counter-productive and cost-prohibitive \u2013 not to mention inhumane.</p> <p>This is terrible news for the private prison business, however, as they are reliant on state and federal governments to provide them with their customer base: that is, bodies to fill their cells.</p> <p>The CCA highlighted its concerns over this potential downturn in demand for services in its <a href=\"http://ir.correctionscorp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=117983&amp;p=irol-reportsannual\">Annual Report</a> to shareholders in 2010:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As it turns out, the CCA is doing just fine. Its revenue in 2010 was a record $1.67bn, an increase of $46m from 2009. Half of that revenue came from contracts with states, and 43% of it came from federal contracts with the US Marshals, the Bureau of Prisons and ICE. Since 9/11, the number of immigrants held in detention has grown exponentially, and the number held in private prisons (not just the CCA's facilities) has increased during that period by 206%, <a href=\"http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/inc_Dollars_and_Detainees.pdf\">according to a report (pdf)</a> by the Sentencing Project.</p> <p>The companies maintain that their lobbying efforts have nothing to do with this expansion and insist that it is their policy to \"expressly prohibit their lobbyists from working to pass or oppose immigration legislation\", such as the Arizona immigration bill SB1070, which provides for the mandatory detention of immigrants who cannot produce papers on request. In an email to me, the CCA's spokesperson, Steve Owen, stated his company's position as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Allow me to strongly reiterate that it is CCA's longstanding corporate policy not to take positions on any legislation at any level of government involving detainment, crime or sentencing policies.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Since it is not to influence custodial policy, where are the private prison firms spending those millions of lobbying dollars? On a state level, it's difficult to ascertain exactly where the funds are directed, as each state has different disclosure requirements for lobbyists. But <a href=\"http://www.justicepolicy.org/research/2614\">a report compiled by the Justice Policy Institute</a> issued in 2011 and using data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics found that between 2003 and 2010, the CCA contributed a total of $1,552,350 to state election campaigns, with its efforts concentrated in California, Florida and Georgia. (Of these contributions, approximately half was to candidates, more than a third was to party committees and around one tenth was spent on ballot measures.) Contracts with the state of California account for 13% of the CCA's total revenue, and Georgia is home to the CCA-run Stewart Detention Center, the largest immigrant detention center in the country.</p> <p>At a federal level, it is much easier to find out exactly where lobbying efforts have been directed. For instance, on the federal government's official lobbying disclosure website, it is possible to do a search to see exactly how much each private prison company has spent in any given year on lobbying efforts, and to find the specific issues they lobbied on. So, in this CCA lobbying report from 2008 (<a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=\" choosefields&amp;reset=\"1&quot;&quot;\">see pdf</a>), it clearly states in box 16 that the \"specific lobbying issues\" were the \"HR1889 (Private Prison Information Act); all provisions and HR1890 (Public Safety Act); all provisions.\"</p> <p>The purpose of the latter bill, <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr1890\">HR1890</a>, was to \"ensure that the incarceration of inmates is not provided by private contractors or vendors and that persons charged with or convicted of an offense against the US shall be housed in facilities managed and maintained by federal, state or local governments\".</p> <p>The bill died in committee. So the CCA lobbied and came out on the winning side against a bill that would have ended privatization of prison services. Whether that fits with the CCA's stated policy of not taking positions on \"any legislation at any level of government involving detainment\" may be moot, for I'm sure its shareholders would feel that those were lobbying dollars well spent.</p> <p>The private prison companies insist that their lobbying and campaign donations are above board and legally compliant. They are corporations in the business of making profit, and so you cannot really blame them for doing whatever it takes to achieve that end.</p> <p>It is their political enablers, the lawmakers who accept millions of dollars from these corporations, who ought to be doing some serious soul-searching. Of all the public services to be outsourced, incarceration, where the state deprives a person of their liberty and assumes responsibility for his or her mental and physical well-being, is not one to be auctioned for campaign contributions.</p>",

  "<p>Western and African political leaders have issued a forceful call for a military intervention in Mali, a country struggling with severe food shortages, drought and conflict. Meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly in New York on Wednesday, several leaders stressed that parts of Mali under rebel control following a coup earlier this year are serving as a haven for terrorists and must be brought under control. Aid officials warn, however, that an armed intervention in Mali could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the region, which has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2012/jul/18/global-development-podcast-hunger-sahel\" title=\"\">experiencing a food and nutrition crisis</a> for nearly a year.</p> <p>\"Any intensification of conflict could make it even more difficult for communities to access the aid they need,\" said Mamadou Biteye, Oxfam's west Africa regional director. \"There is a major risk that military operations in northern Mali would make an already fragile humanitarian situation much worse.\"</p> <p>Since late last year, humanitarian officials <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/dec/07/sahel-facing-major-food-crisis\" title=\"\">have been warning of food shortages</a> in the Sahel, a region of Africa that stretches from Senegal and Mauritania along the Atlantic coast through to Chad and Sudan further east. The situation has been caused largely by erratic rainfall and drought.</p> <p>This is the third hunger crisis to hit the region in less than 10 years. Officials say more than 18 million people are experiencing hunger, including more than 1 million children. Mali, Mauritania, and Chad are the countries hardest hit.</p> <p>Erratic rainfall during the growing season made for a bad start last year. But the situation grew much more complicated in March, when members of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/mali-coup-draws-condemnation-ecowas\" title=\"\">military staged a coup in Bamako</a>, the capital of Mali. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/mali-president-traore-medical-tests\" title=\"\">Dioncounda Traor\u00e9, the country's president, went into hiding</a> and widespread disorder ensued. Within two weeks, Tuareg rebels had taken over large swathes of Mali's north, including the city of Timbuktu.</p> <p>Since then, more than 260,000 refugees have fled northern Mali, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon told Wednesday's meeting, which was attended by the president of the World Bank and more than 50 heads of state.</p> <p>Mali's political insecurity has drawn the attention of major western powers, largely due to the presence of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The group, which is widely considered a terrorist organisation, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/al-qaida-maghreb-sahel-new-somalia\" title=\"\">a significant presence in the Sahel</a>, and in Mali in particular. Analysts say AQIM may be taking advantage of the instability and setting up a stronghold in the rebel-controlled north.</p> <p>\"When a territory as large as France is being occupied by terrorist groups \u2026 you have a threat which concerns the world as a whole,\" Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, told the meeting. He called for the UN security council to adopt a new resolution authorising the deployment of a west African military force in Mali.</p> <p>US secretary of state Hillary Clinton applauded Hollande's strong words, adding: \"Now, with a larger safe haven and increased freedom to manoeuvre, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their networks in multiple directions.&#xa0;This is not only a humanitarian crisis; it is a powder keg that the international community cannot afford to ignore.\"</p> <p>Yayi Boni, the president of Benin, was equally emphatic. \"Nothing can be done in the Sahel without the restoration of the full territorial integrity of Mali,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union made a joint request for the UN to support a regional military force in Mali. In response, the security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sc10698.doc.htm\" title=\"\">issued a resolution</a> in July that condemned the March coup and called for a \"roadmap\" for the restoration of state authority throughout the country.</p> <p>Humanitarian groups are uneasy about military intervention.</p> <p>\"Further fighting risks increasing humanitarian needs and forcing even more people to leave their homes,\" said Biteye. \"If such an operation is launched, all necessary steps must be taken to prevent civilian casualties and ensure respect for international humanitarian and human rights law.\"</p> <p>Ban assured the meeting that any further steps the UN takes in Mali would be \"considered extremely carefully\". And he acknowledged that military intervention could hinder humanitarian action in the region. \"There are no easy answers,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><em>If it is possible for a microwave oven to interfere with Wi-Fi signals \u2013 I just read something like that on your blog \u2013 because they operate at the same frequency, is Wi-Fi then not dangerous to your health? Would having Wi-Fi in your home not be like leaving your microwave door open?</em><br><strong>Hermie</strong><br><br>This is a question that comes up from time to time, and the short answer is no. In fact, we could rephrase your question and pretend that you'd asked about baby alarms, radio-controlled cars, cordless (DECT) phones, Bluetooth headsets, security alarms and loads of other things that operate in the same unlicensed radio frequency band without causing concern. Is having a baby alarm in your home not like leaving your microwave door open?</p> <p>The longer answer is that the intensity of a Wi-Fi signal is around is 100,000 times less than a microwave oven. The oven is a targeted device that operates at very high voltages and short distances. Wi-Fi routers operate at very low voltages, broadcast in all directions, and are used at relatively long distances. </p> <p>Since radio waves follow <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law\">the inverse square law</a> \u2013 like light, sound and gravity \u2013 then each time you double the distance, you get only a quarter of the energy. In other words, the signal strength falls off very rapidly. At normal operating distances, Wi-Fi's intensity is generally so low that it's not worth worrying about: it's just part of the \"smog\" that is generated by radio and TV signals, AC mains wiring, the motors in home appliances, and the universe in general. (As my colleague Charles Arthur once pointed out here, the wavelength of Wi-Fi signals is the same as the <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...311..418S\">cosmic background radiation</a>: 12cm. If you're worried, don't go outside.)</p> <p>As Guardian readers know, the electromagnetic spectrum stretches all the way from very long wave radio frequencies to very short wave gamma rays, with visible light somewhere in between. We know that types of ionising radiation with wavelengths shorter than light tend to be dangerous. Examples include ultraviolet (UV) rays, X-rays and gamma rays. (The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet\">ultraviolet</a> part of sunlight is certainly dangerous. <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column\">Wear sunscreen</a>.)</p> <p>However, the non-ionising wavelengths that are longer than light tend not to be dangerous. These include infra-red rays, microwaves and radio waves. At 2.45GHz, Wi-Fi comes in the microwave band along with baby monitors and mobile phones. After that come the radio frequency bands used for TV broadcasting and AM/FM radio, and further along, long wave radio (famous only for Test Match Special and Economy 7 heating signals).</p> <p>Now, it's certainly possible to do dangerous things with radiation, even if it's just focusing the sun's rays with paraboloid mirrors to set Roman fleets on fire (not that there's much call for that). It's also possible to use a high-pressure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_jet_cutter\">water jet</a> to cut through steel, but that doesn't mean you'll die from taking a bath or standing under a fountain.</p> <p>There have been hundreds of attempts to find out whether Wi-Fi routers or, more importantly, mobile phones represent a health risk. All we can say is that there is no known risk from Wi-Fi. After that, there's the problem of trying to prove a negative.</p> <p>Of course, it does make sense to minimise risk, as long as you concentrate on the biggest risks, not the trivial ones. If you want to do that, the mobile phone must be the first thing to go. In use, the phone is held close to the brain, while the Wi-Fi router may well be in another room (inverse square law). It has been estimated that you get a bigger dose of microwaves from one 20-minute phone call than from a year's Wi-Fi.</p> <p>Twenty laptops and two routers is roughly equivalent to one mobile phone.</p> <p>Your microwave oven should be safe enough because designs are tested to make sure they are properly shielded. However, you could check that your oven isn't leaking radiation, or stay well away from it while it's running. (In this case, \"well away\" is about 1m.) There should be no risk from leaving the door open as the magnetron should cut out when you open the door. However, if the oven is faulty and if it does keep working, don't put any part of your body inside.</p> <p>If you are extremely fussy about Wi-Fi, then make sure you sit 1m (or more) away from the router, and don't use your laptop on your lap. Put it on a table or tray instead. I don't think there is a risk, but you may feel safer if you remove a non-existent risk.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could connect your computers and other devices together using Cat5e cable. This will eliminate your Wi-Fi while also improving the speed and reliability of your internet. Of course, you will still be receiving mobile phone and Wi-Fi signals from neighbours, local mobile phone masts, and distant radio and TV stations. To eliminate some if not all of these, you would need to construct a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage\" \">Faraday cage</a>, which is basically an inside-out microwave oven (it keeps microwaves out instead of keeping them in). </p> <p>Aluminium foil works as a simple Faraday cage, and you can test this by wrapping a mobile phone in foil and then dialling it from another phone. If you get \"unobtainable\", it worked. I expect a few people have taken this further and wallpapered whole rooms with aluminium foil, though the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat\"> \"tinfoil hat\"</a> is a more economical alternative.

Other insulation products such as <a href=\"http://www.celotex.co.uk/\">Celotex</a> could have a similar effect. People who have signal problems might want to see if their insulation is to blame.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation, which has examined the topic in depth, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/peh-emf/about/WhatisEMF/en/index1.html\">says</a>: \"In the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation approximately 25,000 articles have been published over the past 30 years. Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research.\"</p> <p>The main gap appears to be the potential impact on children using mobile phones for more than 10 years. (Children are more susceptible to radiation than adults, and problems may take decades to appear.)</p> <p>My own feeling is that there are more important things to worry about than Wi-Fi. Last year, for example, more than 25,000 people were either killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads, and in 2010, there were 8,790 alcohol-related deaths.

  "<p>Leeds United supporters parched by lack&#xa0;of top-flight football had their welcome draught of it with Tuesday's 2-1 Capital One Cup victory over Everton&#xa0;in the Elland Road rain, a taste of where the fans believe their club should be. The game was watched by David Haigh, a representative of the Bahrain-based Gulf Finance House (GFH), which has confirmed it is negotiating to \"lead and arrange\" a takeover of Leeds, having been in talks with the club's owner, Ken Bates, since as long ago as&#xa0;June.</p> <p>In an 11-minute address on Leeds's in-house television channel before Saturday's 2-1 victory over Nottingham Forest, which lifted Leeds to 12th in the Championship, Bates spent almost as long criticising the Leeds United Supporters Trust (Lust) as he did discussing the club's destiny. He said of the possible investment in Leeds, which is thought to be proposed by private individuals represented by GFH, that there remain \"technical points\" to resolve, although Bates said there is a confidentiality agreement in place and so he did not explain what the outstanding issues are.</p> <p>If Bates, who lives in Monaco as a UK tax exile, does sell up and leave football completely, he will avoid a possible Football Association charge of bringing the game into disrepute. The governing body decided to charge Bates, and Leeds United, at the end of August, but is now holding that charge in abeyance.</p> <p>The charge follows the finding in Leeds county court in June that Bates, and the club itself, committed harassment of Melvyn Levi, a former Leeds director, by publishing personal attacks on him in Bates's chairman's notes in the club's match programme. Leeds's in-house Yorkshire Radio station was also found to have harassed Levi by broadcasting at least six times a public appeal for Levi's whereabouts, because Bates wanted to sue him.</p> <p>Harassment, his honour Judge Gosnell stated, involves \"conduct calculated to cause alarm or distress \u2026 objectively judged to be oppressive and unacceptable\" and involves \"torment of the victim, of an order which would sustain criminal liability\". Bates and Leeds were found to have perpetrated such conduct via the matchday programme, which fans pay \u00a34 to buy, and the radio station supported financially by the club.</p> <p>Levi, 68, told the court this public harassment had a deeply upsetting impact on him and his 69-year-old wife, Carole. Judge Gosnell found the couple had been \"made ill\" and Levi's \"life had been very significantly affected for the&#xa0;worse\".</p> <p>Levi's barrister, Simon Myerson QC, had asked Bates whether he considered the effect his articles would have on the couple. Bates replied that Carole Levi \"doesn't come into my calculations at all\", and Levi was \"big enough to look after himself\".</p> <p>Judge Gosnell said of Bates's attitude: \"I felt his lack of concern, particularly as he must have read the medical evidence on both claimants, was chilling.\"</p> <p>Bates was found to have harassed Melvyn Levi but not Carole because she suffered only one act of harassment, not a \"course of conduct\". She is appealing. The judge ruled that what was published in Leeds United's official output was \"oppressive and unacceptable \u2026 serious enough to sustain criminal liability in the event of breach\".</p> <p>The finding of harassment followed a 2009 high court decision by Sir Charles Gray that Bates had libelled Levi, also in his chairman's articles published prominently in the match programme. Levi's lawyer, Nick Collins of Ford and Warren, then wrote to the FA, informing it of the courts' decisions.</p> <p>On 29 August, an official from the FA's football governance and regulation division wrote to Collins, saying the FA intended to charge Bates: \"I am confident that I will be in a position to confirm the charge with you by telephone tomorrow,\" she wrote.</p> <p>The following day, the FA official asked Collins not to release the information \"regarding the charge\" because the FA was discussing \"publication\" with its own communications department and Leeds themselves. \"It is hoped that this will be resolved today,\" she wrote.</p> <p>Collins heard nothing further until last week, when he was told that the charge is not going ahead now, but will be held in abeyance until the conclusion of a further court case Bates is bringing against Levi. Collins is severely critical of that FA decision: \"Ken Bates has been found by a judge to have committed harassment, serious enough to sustain criminal liability,\" he said. \"Any other court actions \u2013 which Melvyn Levi will be defending absolutely \u2013 are irrelevant. The FA has a duty to protect football and&#xa0;its reputation, and they are declining to act.\"</p> <p>Levi, who says his and Carole's health and happiness have suffered as a result of the harassment, said: \"The FA is doing nothing about this behaviour, which I find disgusting. It leaves Ken Bates free to attack other people.\"</p> <p>In his LUFCTV address on Saturday, Bates said of Lust, a mutual trust of 8,200 members formed according to the legal regulations of Supporters Direct, the organisation funded by the Premier League: \"They are a waste of space, a pain in the arse and achieving nothing.\" He described their contribution as \"agitation stirred up by those idiots\", and trust members as an \"ignorant, illiterate minority\".</p> <p>Lust has analysed Leeds's finances since the club came out of administration in 2007, and argued there has been too much emphasis on building projects rather than team investment. Leeds have borrowed \u00a35m against two years' season ticket money (it now costs \u00a3582 for a season ticket on the Kop) to build banqueting and other facilities in the east stand.</p> <p>During the August transfer window, Neil Warnock had painfully little money to spend on players, while Leeds sold the striker Robert Snodgrass to Norwich City for \u00a33m. In a \"vision statement\" published last year Lust called for the club to engage more positively with fans, who have remained steadfastly loyal throughout these bleak years.</p> <p>Bates's programme notes for Tuesday's Everton match included a personal attack on Gary Cooper, the Lust chairman, stating he was once a member of a \"fringe organisation\", and that Lust has a poor relationship with Leeds United's Disabled Organisation (Ludo). Cooper rejected both completely, and said nobody from the club had contacted him to check these allegations before they were published. Ludo's chair, Stuart Ramm, confirmed there was \"no truth\" in the allegation relating to Ludo. Cooper said he now intends to complain to the FA.</p> <p>The FA has declined to comment, except to confirm that the charge of bringing the game into disrepute against Bates and Leeds has been held in abeyance until all legal cases with Levi are concluded. Leeds United refused to comment, including about the takeover talks, in which Bates said there remain \"a few things\" he wants to resolve with the investors' chairman.</p> <p>In his evidence during the harassment trial, Bates said he writes his chairman's articles with the help of his wife in Monaco, before sending them to be published in the programme. Such is life at Leeds United, one of England's great football clubs, in 2012.</p>",
  "<p>This had to happen eventually. The problem with something as subjective as literature is that your average reader is, sooner or later, going to disagree with majority opinion; and I knew that when it happened during this reread, I would have to write about it honestly. A few weeks ago, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/30/rereading-stephen-king-the-long-walk\" title=\"\">the thread for The Long Walk reread</a>, commenters began listing their top 10 favourite King books. Many, many people included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444708103/firestarter\" title=\"\">Firestarter</a>. And why wouldn't they? It's early King, when (collective wisdom has it) he was still writing exciting, original novels, playing in the ballparks of horror-SF that his diehard early readers love. It's one of the books that stepped into public consciousness \u2013 it had a film made with Drew Barrymore in, for goodness' sake \u2013 and people rattle it off as a classic. I really liked it too. Or, at least, I did the first time that I read it.</p> <p>Charlie McGee is a little girl in the grand, early-King tradition of \"kids with special powers\". Hers is pyrokinesis, and was triggered by some shady drug experiments committed on her parents by an even-more-shady governmental organisation known as The Shop. Oh, and also, because the plot needs it, her dad, Andy, is a bit psychic (another side-effect of the experiments). His power isn't firestarting but something called \"The Push\", which is a bit like Jedi mind-control only not quite as cool and effortless. They're on the run from The Shop, because The Shop wants them back. When The Shop tries to capture them, they kill Charlie's mother, and now Charlie and Andy run and run and run and run. Things happen: there's a hitman hired to pursue them (the amazingly named John Rainbird), Andy and Charlie are separated, Andy becomes addicted to drugs, and then they're captured by The Shop and then they are reunited and then they escape and then the ending happens, where people die and Rolling Stone magazine is, somehow, wound into the tale. It's a series of small events that have repercussions, but none actually really drives the narrative: they feel like bumps in the road instead.</p> <p>For me, that's a problem. The book is ostensibly a road-trip narrative where we're following Andy and Charlie across America. But what I've told you in that paragraph above? It's the whole story. It's a very thin narrative, stretched over a pretty big book, and I'm not sure that one can sustain the other. Then there's the problem of thematic repetition. It's possible that this is an effect of the manner in which I'm reading these books: I'm aware that this isn't a normal way to consume (or re-consume) a body of work. But the issues with Firestarter \u2013 easily, in my opinion, the least effective of King's early works \u2013 come mainly from a terrific sense of my having seen this all before. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444720693/carrie\" title=\"\">Carrie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9781444720723/the-shining\" title=\"\">The Shining</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444720730/the-stand\" title=\"\">The Stand</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444708097/the-dead-zone\" title=\"\">The Dead Zone</a>: they all feature characters with mental abilities not a million miles away from those in Firestarter (and we're not even at <a href=\"http://darktower.wikia.com/wiki/Breakers\" title=\"\">the Breakers</a> yet). In these books, explanations of those abilities are generally vague, and that works to their benefit. Here, The Shop and their experiments are the lynchpin of the entire story: driving it forward, with The Shop as a pursuer that's never really effective or scary. For me, the explanation should have been strapped to the back of a more prominent narrative. Firestarter often feels like it's biding its time, waiting for something earth-shattering to happen.</p> <p>It's not a bad book. I'm doing it a disservice, probably. It's well written, Charlie is exceedingly likable, The Shop has the potential to be a really fun concept ... But Firestarter mostly does nothing. In such a lengthy book, I really missed a three-act structure (or, rather, a more defined three -act structure, given how much of the back-story is told through flashback and reminiscence); I missed the ebb and flow of something more rigid to hold it together. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444708097/the-dead-zone\" title=\"\">The Dead Zone</a> didn't have a conventional structure either, but where risks made that book sing, using them in an effective way, everything in Firestarter feels a little more like treading water. And the length also makes this feel like a bit of a slog. In his early years, King was, for the most part, very good at knowing what books needed to feel epic, and giving them an appropriate page-count. The smaller-in-scope books, he kept short: Rage, The Long Walk, Carrie. This is the first time in my reread I've found something amiss: a King novel that doesn't have the story to back itself up. Would it be better if it were half as long? I'd bet the farm on it.</p> <p>And, yes: this is contentious. I've seen innumerable people on these here internets saying they love Firestarter, and I think that I did, once. It was never top tier for me, but I loved it. Maybe it's the density of how I'm reading these books that highlights the flaws; maybe it's just that there's been a lot of stuff like this in the world since it came out, much of it by King himself. But I also think it's quite a hollow book, something I suspect King himself knows. In the afterword to a recent Dark Tower comic, King stated that he felt Firestarter should \"obviously\" be turned into a comic. He's totally right: it could make an excellent comic mini-series. Cut into six issues, the peaks and troughs of the story would play better, with the smaller fragments of plot dedicated to an issue each. I'd really like that: the opportunity to read this book in a format that actually suits the narrative. Because, honestly? I'm not sure that the long-form novel is it.</p> <h2>Connections</h2> <p>The Shop pops up occasionally in other books, mentioned in The Stand, The Mist and The Tommyknockers, either as a cause of the mess or as the government department tasked to clean said mess up. Perhaps they were something that King once intended to make more of as part of his extended universe? Or, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattGCraig/status/248791184577789952\" title=\"\">as @mattcraig posits</a>, maybe they were just an easy way to use the CIA in a story without directly calling them that?</p> <h2>Next time</h2> <p>We're defending our land and throwing Molotov cocktails at bulldozers in the Bachman-attributed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9780451191939/the-bachman-booksfour-early-novels-by-richard-bachmanrage-the-long-walk-roadwork-the-running-man\" title=\"\">Roadwork</a>.</p>",

Photograph: Dave Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hill/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A fortnight has passed since a dossier was <a href=\"http://shepherds-bush.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/west-ken-report-on-misconduct-in-public.html\">handed to the police</a> alleging that residents of two West London housing estates had been promised preferential treatment in the allocation of replacement homes if they gave their backing to the estates' demolition, and arguing that such behaviour could constitute a criminal offence. </p> <p>I won't go into great detail about the dossier's contents at this stage, though I have seen it and read it carefully. Suffice to say that it contains a number of testimonies from residents, which include claims that officers of the Conservative-run Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) council and people saying they were members of the Conservative Party gave assurances that supporting the council's demolition plans would ensure priority allocation of new homes on the nearby Seagrave Road site - a part of the wider Earls Court redevelopment scheme. Some specific individuals are named. </p> <p>What will happen next? Search me, though I understand the Met is making an assessment. What I can say with certainty is that the dossier further underlines the deep and grievous passions the Earls Court project has generated and the mistrust of those opposed to it of the motives and methods of the council and its developer partner Capco - all of which raises the very pregnant question of whether it really had to be this way.</p> <p>A good insight into the suspicions at work is provided by a tortuous yet engrossing correspondence I've obtained between Stephen Cowan, who leads the council's opposition Labour group, and two of the council's most senior officers (neither of whom, to be clear, are among those named in the dossier as having making alleged legally dubious offers). </p> <p>This correspondence has been going on for a five-month period and seems unlikely to end just yet. On <a href=\"http://www.thecowanreport.com/2012/09/has-h-council-been-complicit-in.html\">his blog</a>, Cowan concludes from the exchanges so far that the council was aware that a so-called \"VIP list\" of residents had been promised priority treatment in rehousing and that this list had been compiled by parties who wanted demolition to proceed, yet has failed to properly investigate claims that some of its own officers had gone along with this activity. </p> <p>Cowan asks if the council has been \"complicit\" in an alleged \"homes for support\" exercise. He considers that no straight answers have been provided to his questions about the matter and that this smells \"like a cover-up.\" </p> <p>H&amp;F's response to claims about an improper list is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Council has not allocated any homes and nobody has received preferential treatment. During a lengthy consultation process, the Council has made a note of people interested in moving to Seagrave Road and will continue to note any further interest. Residents will be moved in accordance with a local lettings plan, which will take into account need and ensure that old homes are demolished only after their replacement homes have been built.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> In other words, while the council acknowledges it has made \"a note\" of people who might be keen to move to Seagrave Road it denies that those people have been promised or will be given priority. Cowan continues to demand an independent inquiry into any involvement by council officers in the compiling of any \"VIP list\" of residents to whom such promises might have been made. He wonders why the council won't oblige him. </p> <p>Cowan and his Labour colleagues, like the anti-demolition campaign, have consistently asked that residents of the two estates \u2013 the West Kensington and its smaller neighbour Gibbs Green \u2013 are given a formal and binding vote on the future of their homes. The council has persistently refused to do this. </p> <p>It is easy to see why H&amp;F might be nervous about arranging such a ballot. Its own <a href=\"http://democracy.lbhf.gov.uk/documents/s18032/Appendix%205%20-%20Initial%20statistical%20analysis%20of%20feedback%20from%20consultation.pdf\">analysis of the consultation responses (pdf)</a> found that more than three times as many estate residents oppose the demolition plan than support it, though it continues to try to spin this massive rejection away. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one of H&amp;F's cabinet members, the Famous <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Council_and_Democracy/Councillors_and_MPs/Councillors/Councillor_Harry_Phibbs.asp\">Harry Phibbs</a>, has tweeted that opponents of the scheme were \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/harryph/status/245592690903879684\">tricked or bullied</a>\" into taking that view and that \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/harryph/status/245568669453778945\">support is growing as the lies are exposed</a>.\" The Famous Harry has <a href=\"http://hfconservatives.typepad.com/residents_first/2012/09/new-dawn-for-west-ken-and-gibbs-green-estates.html\">written</a> that these \"lies\" include telling people that the council's promises to rehouse people in better homes than they have now are false and that they could end up living in Barking instead. The anti-demolition campaign, needless to say, begs to differ.</p> <p>I think you're catching the general tone of the proceedings, one that encompasses the daily lives of many who live in the estates according to those I've spoken to lately. </p> <p>Could all this unpleasantness have been avoided? Was there a way for the council and Capco to have included the estates within the (much) larger Earls Court scheme \u2013 which is, of course, controversial in many other ways \u2013 in a manner that a majority of residents would have embraced? </p> <p>Way back in February 2007, the then new leader of the council Stephen Greenhalgh \u2013 who Boris Johnson has recently made head of his new office for policing and crime \u2013 appeared on the internet channel 18 Doughty Street TV with local Tory MP Greg Hands. Both argued that they wanted to improve the lot of poorer people on their patch of inner West London and tackle deep inequalities. I can no longer find this item online \u2013 perhaps someone else have better luck \u2013 but I recall feeling that they believed what they were saying. </p> <p>Greenhalgh championed the Earls Court project right up until he stepped down as leader earlier this year. Yet to some in the regeneration business the entire Earls Court enterprise has looked unwieldy, impractical and undesirably old-fashioned from the start \u2013 a top-heavy, top-down wrecking ball of a scheme that will be difficult to finance, characterised by unrealistic claims and always at risk of incurring resentment. And it doesn't look to me like a project guided by the bottom-up, localist, \"big society\" principles that modern Conservative administrations are supposed to be applying, particularly in a London borough seen as a trailblazer for national party policy \u2013 David Cameron's favourite council, no less.</p> <p>Perhaps H&amp;F assumed that it and Capco would be able to press on smoothly with their plans, brushing all opposition aside with ease. But although the council continues to steam ahead, surely confident that its admirer Mayor Johnson won't use his powers to stand in their way, I doubt it expected opposition of quite the type that it has met. </p> <p>Jonathan Rosenberg, the anti-demolition campaign's community organiser, is a veteran of such community-based struggles. He was right in the thick of a huge battle against the radical Tories of Dame Shirley Porter's Westminster in the 1990s. That ended with residents taking control of homes Westminster wanted to sell off and the Dame eventually being relieved of \u00a312 million. </p> <p>Many in the property trade see Capco as unstoppable. But the campaigners insist they will grind the Earls Court scheme down to a halt. If they succeed, the council and the developers will have only themselves to blame.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's senior judge has stressed that criminals who break into homes are committing offences against the person as well as offences against property.</p> <p>Lord Judge, the lord chief justice, was responding to questions about the case in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/burglars-accept-risk-shot-judge?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">two burglars were shot while trying to burgle a farm cottage in Leicestershire</a>.

  "<p>\"I grew up in London and didn't give horses or ponies a thought until I went for a hack on an Easter holiday in Cornwall. After that I became officially pony obsessed, but consistently failed to convince my parents that our back garden was big enough to keep a pony in. They did, however, let me have lessons and so my weekly jaunt to various riding schools began. To fill the time between lessons I pretended my bikes were horses, set up makeshift jump courses in the back garden to gallop over and ran a riding school and a racing yard in my imagination. Horses weren't particularly big in Croydon, so I found my horsey friends in pony books, getting lost in the pages as I gained my first insight into caring for ponies and dreamt of galloping over open moors and boldly flying huge stone walls. The books became well-thumbed, tatty-cornered familiars and it seemed natural after one inspiring riding holiday to pick up my pen and begin to write the horsey adventures accumulating in my own mind. I wrote my first story when I was up in my bedroom, promising that I was revising hard for my French GCSE.</p> <p>I left school and trained with horses, as a riding instructor, in a show jumping yard then at a racing yard. I returned to London to read English at UCL then stayed, writing for various horsey websites before landing a job in publishing. But the horse bug was in my blood and I missed them tremendously; I spent most of my time daydreaming about them. That's when I found myself ensconced in the cosy yard at Blackberry Farm with four new friends and their ponies. I decided to write the kind of stories I would have loved to have read when I was younger, full of pony detail, adventure, friendship and fun; and so the Pony Detectives were born. I write in my study, cat on my lap, still surrounded by the familiar pony books of my childhood.\"</p> <p>Belinda Rapley is the author of the Pony Detectives series. She has been immersed in the world of horses since she was 11. She is a British Horse Society Instructor, has a National Diploma in Horse Studies and has spent time working in show jumping and flat racing. Belinda is currently training to be a social worker in children's and young people services between flying around the Norfolk countryside on a huge piebald horse.

The Black Stallion by Walter Farley</h2> <p>Without even opening the front cover I can still picture each page of this book, it left such an impression on me. The version I have was based on the film, with photos throughout. After Alec saves the ferociously temperamental but talented black stallion from a shipwreck, the stallion saves the boy's life when Alec grabs the lead rope and is pulled through the sea to a deserted island. The pair strike up a bond as castaways before being rescued and shipped back to America. They finally end up on the racetrack and The Black proves his almighty speed, winning a prestigious race. For me the excitement and romance of the story is all at the start, when Alec forges a bond with such a creature as The Black. It reminds me even now of the privilege we as humans have of sharing time with such magnificent, powerful animals. The trust they place in us and we in them each time we spend time with them in the field, or sit on their backs, is awesome.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141321035\">Black Beauty by Anna Sewell</a></h2> <p>I can't read this book or watch the film without at least one packet of tissues next to me. It's a timeless reminder to me of the fate horses and ponies have \u2013 they're the only pet we have which is sold on when they're outgrown, get too old to carry on doing what they were bought to do, or when they're simply no longer wanted. They're likely to experience many different homes and different fortunes through their life. With each move they have to settle into new routines and yards, make new horsey friends and wait while their new owners work out how they tick. Although Black Beauty holds up to the mirror the thoughtless cruelty of the Victorian world she inhabits, I think her voice still serves as a modern day reminder for all horse owners to think of the world from our horse's perspective, rather than our own. My own horse, Zano, will stay in my care forever to avoid any of the fates Black Beauty endured. </p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781405226660\">War Horse by Michael Morpurgo</a></h2> <p>I read the book by master storyteller, Michael Morpurgo, many years ago and sat next to an unashamedly wailing woman during the awesome National Theatre production. This book is similar to Black Princess, the story of one of Black Beauty's descendents who is shipped off to the first world war before finding peace after its conclusion. Following in the hoof prints of both Black Beauty and Black Princess, this book is written in the first person, with Joey the horse as narrator. It doesn't shy away from the horrors of war for both the humans and horses. I can't read it without wishing that I could change the fate of Topthorn, and in doing so change the fate of some two million other horses who suffered as Topthorn did. Reading War Horse is heart wrenching and exhausting, yet ultimately uplifting and it leaves an echo long, long after the last page is turned. For me it has the most powerful impact of any horse story ever written. </p> <h2>4. Jill's Riding Club by Ruby Ferguson</h2> <p>The Jill books are enjoyable reads, with Jill and her friends getting into all sorts of old fashioned scrapes. Jill herself is great fun and very likeable, along with her two ponies, Black Boy and Rapide. In this story Jill's friend suggests that she starts up a riding club during the summer holidays. It's a bit of a shambles to begin with, but with some outside help in the shape of Major Hooley they begin to get organised and enjoy treasure hunts, gymkhanas and some jumping. There are lots of incidents packed into the pages and rivalries along the way until the end of the summer heralds the end of the club, and it comes to an end as simply and enjoyably as it starts. </p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849393263\">Dora at Follyfoot by Monica Dickens</a></h2> <p>Another series and it's again difficult to choose my favourite, but this one just edges it. I love Monica Dickens's style of writing and her descriptions of the various equine rejects which live at Follyfoot Farm, the wonderfully named Home of Rest for Horses. The regular horses, ponies and donkeys which feature are all lovingly familiar and their numbers are always being added to, despite the Captain's express instruction to the contrary. The farm's aim is to stop suffering and save lives and each story is filled with ponies and horses in need of both from their clueless or cruel owners. The farm survives on a shoestring and in this story a midnight chase has to be won to help pay for the most recently saved resident, and another recent addition \u2013 Barny \u2013 saved from the bullet by Dora, is their only chance of victory. I only have one criticism of this series \u2013 there weren't enough books in it! </p> <h2>6. Ticket to Ride by Caroline Akrill</h2> <p>This is the third in the Eventing Trilogy by Caroline Akrill. I hadn't read the first two when I bought this book but I became quite obsessed by it when I was younger. Elaine wins a scholarship to pursue her dream to become an eventer but she struggles to shake off the Fanes, who she previously worked for and who still claim a stake in Elaine's talented bay horse \u2013 The Legend. The depiction of the Fanes in their dark, dank ancestral home, with their threadbare livery horses and greasy mutton stew was so vivid, I can still picture it now. Elaine's ambition and determination to fulfil her dream also struck me and it was more adult in that sense than the other pony books I was reading at the time.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780192719553\">Flambards by KM Peyton</a></h2> <p>I first read this when I was quite young, and I can still remember why I fell in love with it. It was all to do with Sweetbriar, the kind, gentle and quiet strawberry roan mare, who Christina learns to ride on when she first arrives at her Uncle Russell's house. She was such a sweet mare and I was desperate when she was to be sent to the hunt kennels at the end of what Christina's Uncle Russell deemed her useful life only to be overjoyed when Christina, stable hand Dick and one of Christina's cousins, William, help rescue her from her grim fate. Sweetbriar faded from the books after this, and although I enjoyed the rest, it was always this first, beautifully written and most horsey of the Flambards series with the presence of Sweetbriar, that I loved most.</p> <h2>8. Pony Club Cup by Josephine Pullein-Thompson</h2> <p>I love the Pullein-Thompson sisters and this book by Josephine was the first in the series about the Woodland Pony Club. The Club's made up of a mishmash of riders who don't take riding too seriously and have disruptive ponies. But a new instructor arrives and stirs the Club into action. The \"smashed up\" ex-national hunt jockey with a moody temperament isn't exactly a popular choice amongst the riders, but the story charts the transformation of the club under his firm but inspiring leadership. At times it can be a bit too instructive but what made it for me was the feeling of reality the books evoked. There's a list detailing the main characters and their ponies at the start of the book, and the photos on the front and the back cover match them immaculately, all of which convinced me that somewhere in England, the Woodbury Pony Club really did exist. I would have given anything to have joined them.</p> <h2>9. A Pony to School by Diana Pullein-Thompson</h2> <p>Another by a Pullein-Thompson, this time Diana. This offers a window into a world gone by, filled with grooms, afternoon teas, and orchards for the ponies to roam in. It was a world I longed to inhabit. Each character had more than one pony to choose from. The names of the ponies enchanted me \u2013 Seaspray, Symphony and Daybreak \u2013 it's what inspired me to name all the bikes in my shed at home and go to the \"stables\" to choose which pony I was going to ride that day. It also has one of the most moving yet unsentimental moments when Seaspray loses her battle against tetanus, which still makes me cry to this day even after reading it a hundred times. </p> <h2>10. The Magic Pony by Patricia Leitch</h2> <p>This book is part of the Jinny series, one of my all time favourites. It was so hard to pick just one because each book is gripping \u2013 they have so much gritty detail and Jinny's every thought about her life and her horse is shared with the reader; she was a real heroine to me, she was opinionated and made some bad decisions, as she does in this book, but that makes it even easier to identify with her. I desperately wanted to own Shantih, Jinny's arab mare; she matched Jinny's feistiness and was breathtaking and exotic with her circus background. I chose this book because the version I have has such a captivating, mesmeric pony on the cover, which matches the description of the pony in the book perfectly. Just glancing at it stirs up a memory, not of the detail of the story, but of the emotion captured within it.</p>",
  "<p>A New York federal appeals court will hear arguments against the Defense of Marriage Act on Thursday, in the latest battle for same-sex equality in the US.</p> <p>Lawyers for 83-year-old Edith Windsor argue that the act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, is unconstitutional.</p> <p>Although certain states in the US recognise same-sex marriage, those unions are not recognised by the federal government. Judges have already found against the Defense of Marriage Act in other states and four appeal cases are waiting to go before the supreme court.</p> <p>Windsor married her partner Thea Clara Spyer in Toronto in 2007, but when Spayer died in 2009, Windsor had to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes. Windsor's lawyers say she would not have had to pay the tax were it not for the Defense of Marriage Act, and argue that the 1996 law violates the 14th amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees equal protection under the law.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union filed the case on behalf of Windsor earlier this year. In June a federal district judge in New York ruled in Windsor's favour, finding that a central provision of the Defense of Marriage Act discriminates against married same-sex couples, but that was not the end of the legal battle.</p> <p>Although the Obama administration said last year it considered the law unconstitutional and would no longer defend it, a group appointed by the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives is defending the law in courts across the country.</p> <p>That group appealed the district court's decision in the Windsor case to the 2nd circuit court, which expedited the appeal due to Windsor's poor health \u2013 she suffers from a serious heart condition \u2013 and will hear the case on Thursday.</p> <p>Windsor has also asked the supreme court to review her case before the 2nd circuit reaches a decision. Federal courts in Massachusetts, California and Connecticut have previously found the law unconstitutional.</p> <p>Those appeals are now pending before the supreme court, which has not yet decided whether it will take up the issue in its next term. The justice department has filed petitions in all four cases, asking the high court to review the constitutionality of the law's definition of marriage.</p>",
  "<p>I've just been listening to a retired social worker and Rochdale council's chief executive being harried on Radio 4's Today programme over the failure of the town's police and social services to protect teenage girls from predatory sexual exploitation. It comes as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/rochdale-police-sex-abuse-girls\" title=\"\">a report is published</a> in the wake of prison sentences for nine men involved in an organised sex ring earlier this year.</p> <p>Alas, we're getting used to this sort of story. This week the Times, whose reporter Andrew Norfolk has done a lot of good work in this area, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article3551057.ece\" title=\"\">published a similar expos\u00e9 in Rotherham</a>, where again both social workers and police seem to have treated the teenagers not as victims but as complicit young adults, even as prostitutes.</p> <p>It's shocking stuff and reflects the chaotic way morality ebbs and flows in a society as currently unrestrained as our own. It now transpires that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/25/megan-stammers-teacher-relationship-school\" title=\"\">the French police are not looking very hard</a> for the missing 15-year-old schoolgirl Megan Stammers and her teacher boyfriend (30), because 15 is the age of consent in France, so what's the big deal? TV veteran Anne Diamond has fallen foul of the Daily Mail for saying as much on Sky News. What price European cultural relativism, eh? Catholic versus Protestant?</p> <p>Apart from the human cost (one victim interviewed anonymously for Today sounded very frightened and very sad, after also being repeatedly failed by the authorities) the issue interests me for two reasons. One is the obvious one, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/may/09/sex-grooming-far-right-asian\" title=\"\">about which I have written before</a>: that group grooming, as distinct from solitary sexual predators, tend to be by British Asians of Pakistani Muslim background living in poorer communities in the north.</p> <p>Clearly it's a sensitive subject, which the far-right is keen to exploit. Not all such grooming rings are so described, certainly not the eight men sentenced to between 44 months and seven years at Derby crown court this month if we judge them by their names. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-17996245\" title=\"\">The BBC sets out the controversy here</a>. .</p> <p>But no amount of fair-mindedness can duck the conclusion that there's a cultural problem in the attitudes of some Asian men towards their own women that results in them abusing teenage white girls in industrial towns and cities.</p> <p>It has to be addressed, not swept under a traditional village rug, and plenty of public figures \u2013 including British Asians and Martin Nairey of Barnado's \u2013 agree. We don't do people favours by condoning or pretending to ignore things we know are wrong because they offend sensibilities, whether it's intra-cousin marriage or \u2013 closer to home \u2013 casually broken family structure.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3548574.ece\" title=\"\">a Times article (paywall)</a> this week, Rotherham's Labour MP, Denis MacShane, identifies three areas of denial: by the police, social workers and a weak Crown Prosecution Service; by the South Asian community, whose response resembles that of the Catholic church when confronted with systemic child abuse; and by wider society, by ministers (who might want to consider a guardianship procedure for at-risk teens) and a media that treats prostitution more as a career choice than a grim necessity.</p> <p>Not a bad list \u2013 perhaps you can do better? \u2013 but it leads to my second worry. Namely that we pile responsibility for sorting out the chaos we create in our own lives on overworked and overstressed professions, some of them understaffed and underpaid too. Never a day passes without the council, social services, harassed teachers or the police getting it in the neck.</p> <p>It's not that, case by case, they don't deserve to be chided in print or on the Today programme. There are suggestions this week that Britain's tardy adoption practices are finally showing signs of improvement because comparative local authority performance tables are now available, and seem to act as a spur to greater activity.</p> <p>But public officials bear fearsome burdens for individual human lives \u2013 and risk castigation when they get it wrong \u2013 which senior executives in an oil company or even a newspaper rarely bear. Nor do they pay such a price when they make mistakes, as they do. Tony Hayward, the ex-BP CEO who mismanaged the politics of BP's Gulf oil spill, is probably doing quite nicely on the conference circuit explaining his mistakes.</p> <p>Financial cuts need not always mean cuts to frontline services; there are usually better, cheaper ways of doing things. I heard a few heartwarming tales on the Lib Dem conference fringe this week (Torbay seems to have cracked integrated care for the elderly) and expect to hear more at the Labour and Tory conferences.</p> <p>But frontline services <em>are</em> being cut \u2013 I hear that on the fringe too. So more parents who lose control of their kids, for whatever reason, mean more work for hard-pressed public services that should respond more sensitively but may feel, mistakenly but very humanly, that they have got more deserving priorities than truculent teenagers.</p>",

  "<p>This is the centenary year of Michelangelo Antonioni. He was born on 29 September 1912 and died in 2007 at the age of 94, having worked until almost the very end. As well as everything else, he gave us one of the founding myths of postwar cinema: The Booing of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76695/avventura\" title=\"\">L'Avventura</a>. For film historians, it's as pretty much important as the <a href=\"http://classicalmusic.about.com/od/20thcenturymusic/qt/rite-of-spring.htm\" title=\"\">audience riots at the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring</a>.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/cannesfilmfestival\" title=\"\">Cannes film festival</a> on 15 May 1960, Antonioni presented his L'Avventura, a challenging and difficult film and a decisive break from his earlier work, replete with languorous spaces and silences. This was movie-modernism's difficult birth. The film was jeered so ferociously, so deafeningly, that poor Antonioni and his beautiful star Monica Vitti burst into tears where they sat. There was yet more booing when it got a special jury prize the following week. But nowadays Antonioni and L'Avventura get something more hurtful than boos: indifference. His great work, once a fixture of the <a href=\"http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/\" title=\"\">Sight &amp; Sound Top 10 list</a>, this year plummeted out of the charts. This remarkable director has become a bit unfashionable: his kind of high European cinema doesn't command attention the way it did.</p> <p>So who were those boo-ers anyway, those scarlet-faced, dinner-jacketed objectors? (The critic Alexander Walker once wryly told me they were standard-issue French bourgeoisie who didn't realise this wretched film was going to be so long, and were hungry for their dinner.) If they wanted to persuade the world that this emperor was naked, they didn't succeed. But were they just a bunch of grotesque philistines? Over past few months, I've been taking a look at this brilliant film-maker's body of work, and now I wonder if the booing isn't more complicated than I thought.</p> <p>The title refers, ambiguously, to an adventure, or an affair. Antonioni himself was taking his audience on an adventure, away from conventional film-making, out into open waters, like the fateful boat journey in the movie's first act. Then he cut the motor, just as they were out of sight of land. However boorish, the boo-ers might just have been registering understandable dismay at the farewell to Antonioni's early \"realist\" period of the 1950s, in which he made conventionally paced and structured films, whose own mysterious brilliance has been forgotten. L'Avventura ushered in a phase of Antonioni's work for which he is well known and well parodied. But maybe the vast bulk of his career is effectively a kind of Jamesian \"late\" period, which shouldn't be allowed to overshadow those stunning first films. The 1950s classics: The Lady Without Camelias, The Friends, The Vanquished \u2013 these are the DVDs which I now feel like shoving into people's hands and saying: watch this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396782210\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348742927358/Monica-Vitti-and-Gabriele-010.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Vitti and Gabriele Ferzetti in Michelangelo Antonioni's modern masterpiece L'Avventura (1960)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lady vanishes \u2026 Monica Vitti and Gabriele Ferzetti in L'Avventura. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Criterion</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Criterion</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In L'Avventura, famously, something mysterious happens and then, defying the rules of movie narrative, it refuses to un-happen. The mystery is unsolved. A group of well-to-do vacationers go on a trip to Lisca Bianca on Panarea, one of the Aeolian islands off the coast of Sicily; there one unhappy young woman, Anna (Lea Massari), vanishes and her perplexing disappearance brings together her fiance Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) and best friend Claudia (Vitti) in a doomy and melancholy affair in which they experience a kind of existential fear \u2013 and appreciate the advantages of non-being. As for Anna, she might theoretically have just run away, escaped from a marriage she was dreading and become another missing-person statistic. But it could also be that this island, like the mysterious Australian rock formation in Peter Weir's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96212/picnic-at-hanging-rock\" title=\"\">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a> or the Marabar Caves in EM Forster's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/classics/9780141441160/a-passage-to-india\" title=\"\">A Passage to India</a>, have somehow become the epicentre of occult metaphysical crisis. Anna has dematerialised. Her atoms have been blown away in the wind. She has had a very human yearning for absence, for the annulment of all the cares that torment her. All this, in a kind of anti-miracle, has been granted her.</p> <p>There are some extraordinary set-pieces. The final sequence in the hotel foreshadows the nightmare-puzzle of Alain Resnais's <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Last Year in Marienbad</a> (1961) and the bizarre scene in which vast, excitable crowds in Palermo mob a sexy celebrity writer called Gloria Perkins is very like that in Godard's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78126/breathless\" title=\"\">Breathless</a> (1960), in which Jean Seberg's Patricia goes to interview the famed author Parvulesco, played in cameo by Jean-Pierre Melville. L'Avventura surely influenced <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/michael-haneke\" title=\"\">Michael Haneke</a> and the Iranian director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/asghar-farhadi\" title=\"\">Asghar Farhadi</a>.</p> <p>I am a bit more agnostic about the movies that followed. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76136/notte\" title=\"\">La Notte</a>, or The Night, in 1961 has wonderful performances from Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau as Giovanni and Lidia, the unhappily married couple in fashionable society who attend a smart all-night party, their mood drenched in ennui and clouded by Giovanni's obvious infatuation with another woman \u2013 again, Monica Vitti. But I found the ending contrived and contorted. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76238/red-desert\" title=\"\">The Red Desert</a> in 1964 was Antonioni's first colour film and I think one of the best of his \"high\" period of opaque existential anxiety. Vitti is the industrialist's wife who is suffering from depression following a car wreck, and the brutal, polluted landscape makes northern Italy look like another planet, like the Paris of Godard's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/75764/alphaville\" title=\"\">Alphaville</a> (1965).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0uVPQG01JHk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0uVPQG01JHk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uVPQG01JHk\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p> <p>Antonioni's three English-language films come after this, and here is where I part company from many pundits. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36260/blow-up\" title=\"\">Blow-Up</a> (1966) is the swinging-London tale of a fashion photographer, played by David Hemmings, who accidentally takes a photo of a murder in a London park, and only realises it when he begins to enlarge the background in grainy detail. It's is a metaphysical mystery in what critic Richard Hofstadter called the \"paranoid style\", perhaps inspired by the endlessly scrutinised <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq1PbgeBoQ4\" title=\"\">Zapruder home-footage</a> of the Kennedy assassination. Now I have to admit something: I've often felt like booing the weak ending \u2013 which offers neither conventional plot resolution nor an interesting restatement of metaphysical mystery. Hemmings's scrutiny of the photographs is revealed with a superbly disturbing sequence of black-and-white still images, accompanied by the eerie sounds of the wind in the trees remembered from the park. But the rest of the movie is distended with a series of wacky vignettes and redundant action, including a superfluous if entertaining and atmospheric scene in which Hemmings finds himself at a secret concert given by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/191de76f-a224-445d-b041-54df16d65bf7\" title=\"\">the Yardbirds</a> in a basement club off Oxford Street.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Xz1utzILj4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Xz1utzILj4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xz1utzILj4\">Reading this on mobile?

It urgently captures the times, with some great documentary-realist crowd scenes, very American, and yet the fugitive love affair at its centre is very Godardian. I have never seen a film which fuses European and American sensibilities so well, and the final apocalyptic vision of an explosion of consumer goods is a brilliant dream-spectacle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aBnBCy3osnE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aBnBCy3osnE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBnBCy3osnE\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p> <p>Zabriskie Point got Antonioni awful reviews in the US, but in many ways it's one of his most daring and experimental movies, though overshadowed by the star-power of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/81898/passenger\" title=\"\">The Passenger</a> (1975), with Jack Nicholson as Locke, the world-weary reporter who vanishes \u2013 as in L'Avventura \u2013 by filching the identity of a dead stranger who turns out to be an arms dealer, and whose own inevitable death Locke must now calmly, even ecstatically accept.</p> <p>As for the rest of Antonioni's films, my neurotically completist mission to see all the features yielded a mixed set of reactions. His <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068375/\" title=\"\">Chung Kuo \u2013 China</a> (1972) is a punishingly long, three-and-a-half-hour documentary about that country which often looks like nothing more than a rather naive travelogue-cum-home-movie. But there is real archival interest there. The 1981 feature The Mystery of Oberwald, based on Cocteau's play The Two-Headed Eagle, was pioneeringly made on analogue video, with weird filter effects, though it now has the flat look of a laborious television play. (In fairness, I should say I could only locate a fuzzy VHS copy.) It certainly doesn't deserve to be forgotten, though, as it features Vitti's most mature and developed performance, as the queen who falls in love with a would-be assassin who was a doppelganger of her late husband.</p> <p>After this, Antonioni's career is something of a long goodbye. He began to take an interest in eroticism. His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76493/identification-of-a-woman\" title=\"\">Identification of a Woman</a> (1982) features some notably explicit sex scenes and, disconcertingly, it does look a little like a porn film. Antonioni suffered a stroke in the mid-80s, but it was a testament to his energy and stamina that he was able to keep writing short stories, and returned with his final film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/58851/beyond.the.clouds\" title=\"\">Beyond the Clouds</a> (1995) based on some of his stories, made with the assistance of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/wim-wenders\" title=\"\">Wim Wenders</a>. Again, it has a rather softcore-erotic feel. But it interestingly restates the themes of Blow-Up, as its lead character, played by John Malkovich, says: \"I only discovered reality when I began photographing it, photographing and enlarging the surface of things around me \u2026\" Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau are brought back for a moving cameo as an elderly couple.</p> <p>And so Antonioni gradually faded from view, a shadow of his former self, whose last work in 2004 was a pallid short film contributed to a collection called Eros \u2013 a film whose supposed eroticism was unconvincing.</p> <p>So now it is a really thrilling experience to return to the almost-forgotten prehistory of Antonioni, those punchy, cerebral but often highly experimental realist pictures of the 1950s, beginning with the Greeneian, downbeat <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_a_Love_Affair\" title=\"\">Story of a Love Affair</a> (1950), about a forbidden relationship rekindled by the snoopings of a private detective. The film precedes by one year the publication of Greene's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099478447/the-end-of-the-affair\" title=\"\">The End of the Affair</a> and in its seediness resembles Patrick Hamilton's Gorse novels, or Gerald Kersh's Night and the City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396782211\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348747189608/The-Lady-Without-Camelias-006.jpg\" alt=\"The Lady Without Camelias\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lady Without Camelias</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Antonioni's The Lady Without Camelias (1953) is a wonderful film, and in fact my favourite of his. It's a brilliant tragicomedy about the movie business: the missing link between Truffaut's Day for Night (1973) and Sturges's Sullivan's Travels (1941). I think its desperate sadness and emotional maturity entitle it to neglected-masterpiece status. Lucia Bos\u00e9 plays Clara, a former shop assistant from Milan who has been discovered by ambitious movie producer Gianni Franchi (Andrea Checchi). Without ever consciously choosing a film career, or being in any way happy or fulfilled in it, she is swept up into huge commercial success in light musicals and comedies. Poor Clara and her husband become obsessed with getting her into classy, quality cinema \u2013 a delicious irony, given Antonioni's own spectacular career arc. Clara's tragic destiny is to confuse love and contentment with a successful career in arthouse cinema: she has a fatal delusion that success in high art \u2013 just out of reach \u2013 is crucial to human happiness and self-respect. What a glorious film it is, Chekhovian in its wit and melancholy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046492/\" title=\"\">The Vanquished </a>(1953) is a captivatingly strange portmanteau film, featuring three brash and anxious tales from France, Italy and England, ripped from the newspaper headlines. Moody and alienated young delinquents are killing for thrills, for celebrity, for the sheer Dostoevskian hell of it. The Italian segment gives the clearest indication so far of the way Antonioni's film-making was going to develop. After killing a customs officer, a young man runs desperately away and falls, hitting his head. From here, he wanders around in a daze, not entirely lucid. His meanderings are a hint of the strange phases and altered states of L'Avventura.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047821/\" title=\"\">The Friends</a> (1955) a young woman called Clelia arrives in Turin to manage a new fashion house; she is played by Eleonora Rossi, with a resemblance to Ingrid Bergman. On her first night, she is shocked to discover the woman in the hotel-room next to hers has attempted suicide: this is Rosetta (Madeleine Fischer). At once, Clelia finds herself involved in the life of Rosetta's circle of excitable, mercurial friends. It is as almost as if these friends sense that, however much Rosetta recovers from her suicide attempt, she is now absent, and that Clelia is being groomed as a replacement \"friend\". It is a brilliant and disturbing serio-comedy, gossipy, soapy, melodramatic.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050458/\" title=\"\">The Cry</a> (1957) shows Antonioni beginning to morph into the famous creator of the later movies. Aldo (Steve Cochran) has a furious row with the woman with whom he has had a child. He leaves and takes their daughter with him, on a quest to find a woman who could possibly be a replacement for his lost love and a mother to his girl. He wonders if he can make a new life for himself, perhaps efface his catastrophic life choices. Aldo is electrified by the tall tales of a dredger captain he meets, who says he made a modest pile working in Venezuela. Aldo actually goes so far as to get a map of that country, with some sort of booklet showing employment opportunities for a skilled mechanic. But then, on a despairing whim, a sudden, bleak realisation that this is all nonsense, he simply throws the map and the papers away \u2013 they flutter off on the wind. It is a superb, rather literary moment. Here is where the existential fume of Antonioni's work begins to be distilled: from the bones of plot arises the smoke of anxiety, disenchantment, alienation \u2013 but also a numbed kind of rapture and release at human helplessness.</p> <p>So this is my essential Antonioni viewing list, divided into early and late, or perhaps pre-Boo and post-Boo. All of them are the work of a master, and yet if I had to recommend one to start off with, it would be The Lady Without Camelias. You can't appreciate what a strange and wonderful director Antonioni is without watching that early gem. I think it is through a rediscovery of these early classics that Antonioni's reputation will rise once more.</p> <h2>Early Antonioni</h2> <p>La Signora Senza Camelie (The Lady Without Camelias) (1950)<br>I Vinti (The Vanquished) (1953)<br>Le Amiche (The Friends) (1955)<br>Il Grido (The Cry) (1957)</p> <h2>Late Antonioni</h2> <p>L'Avventura (1960)<br>Il Deserto Rosso (The Red Desert) (1964)<br>Zabriskie Point (1970)<br>The Passenger (1975)</p>",

At the last check we had marked men, bullseyes on backs, killing threats and threats of knocking people's brains in! There are some big lads in that American team....</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>3.07pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18515655\">laraxwell</a> wants some betting advice and to talk rough: <strong>\"I got Europe at 8/5. A wise bet? And Love's treatment of the fairways seems odd \u2013 almost turning the thing into a long driving competition or a sort of testosterone booster for US players and fans. It has sort of taken the golf out of it.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18518336\">Ewan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think Europe are overpriced, but then again home advantage has become such a huge thing in this event the bookies maybe are as wise as ever.</p> <p>I've never seen a course with such a lack of rough. Even the rough isn't rough, if that makes sense. It should basically favour those spraying it about a bit \u2013 as Watson can, as Mickelson can. But it also brings in a proper recovery shot, which can be the most exciting in golf.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>3.12pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18516802\">StandfreeFM</a> asks: <strong>\"It's traditional to say Europe need a lead going into the singles on Sunday. Is this as applicable now with many of the Europeans being so high in the world rankings?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18518391\">Ewan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Good question, although world rankings and Ryder Cup records don't always link particularly readily. What is clear is that by an expected \"front 8\" of Westwood, Lawrie, Donald, Garcia, Poulter, Rose, McDowell and McIlroy, Olazabal is seeking a quick start. It would be a big blow to Europe if they don't get it.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>3.16pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18517213\">StandfreeFM</a> asks: <strong>\"It is no longer effectively the European Tour v PGA Tour so perhaps with familiarity there is less chance of the scenes witnessed at Kiawah Island/Brookline. Does the fact that most of the Europeans are now based in the US diminish or enhance the Ryder Cup Spectacle?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18518470\">Ewan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a fascinating point. The atmosphere in the crowds is already pretty keyed up (U-S-A chants yesterday afternoon for example) but you have a group of 24 players who are, mainly, good friends and some of them are neighbours. There aren't really the divisive figures which the Ryder Cup had in the past. Hence the comments of Poulter and Snedeker are especially notable.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>3.19pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18517580\">figbat</a> asks: <strong>\"Do you think any player will only be selected to play in the singles matches and therefore not experience any of the foursomes etc? Who could fall into this category?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18518508\">Ewan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I would be surprised if that happens. It would be dangerous to throw someone out cold on Sunday.

I think this Ryder Cup has so many evenly matched players that the draw could make less of a difference than it has for some time.</p> <p>I should add on selection matters, the Friday morning selections will be revealed at the captain's speeches tonight. And therefore done independently, not drawn or anything like that. </p> <p>The key consideration for Olazabal is where to place McIlroy and McDowell in the field. And, of course, each captain makes his picks with half an inkling/eye on what the opposition will do. That will be especially pertinent for Sunday's singles; do you load the draw with your best players at the front or back? </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>3.23pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18517357\">TCtiger</a> asks: <strong>\"Is there a lack of rough on the whole course, or just off the fairways?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18518581\">Ewan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The whole course.

I met him in a restaurant in Augusta and he was very good company. He has strong opinions, which of course is great for the media. </p> <p>I think the US fans are more vocal than in Europe but there are explanations for that \u2013 one country against a continent, as one. I wouldn't expect anything out of order over the weekend, although I agree there is a fine line between highlighting strong support and criticising it for being over the top.</p> <p>They are anticipating circa 45,000 people here each day. In a golfing context, that is massive. On practice days, it has been 10 deep at certain tees and greens. I feel sorry for people because of the viewing spectacle in that density, but it creates a very strong (and in this case partisan) atmosphere indeed.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>3.43pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18518867\">laraxwell</a> asks for predictions: <strong>\"Could we have your opening day four balls and foursomes preview?

He seems to be brilliant under pressure, has a fine rookie record and, maybe helpfully, he didn't have a great week at Atlanta. Snedeker always seemed a bit ropey to me when things get hot, although he obviously offered a great reply to that point at the Tour Championship.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>3.53pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18519001\">StandfreeFM</a> asks: <strong>\"I heard Furyk going on about 'soccer style chants' from the Europeans.

No, have heard nothing but that one chant. Suspect I'll hear a lot more of it over the weekend.

I reckon Europe will win narrowly. There are question marks over a number of the USA players in pressure situations, which I reckon offsets home advantage.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>4.01pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18519368\">TCtiger</a> asks: <strong>\"Do you think G-mac and wee-mac are automatic pairings for all four rounds?

Or could Olazabal stick Rory with another young gun in the fourballs?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18519488\">Ewan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Potential for change highlighted this morning \u2013 Rory on course with Rose, Garcia and Kaymer. McDowell with Poulter, Donald, Molinari. But would be a major surprise if McIlroy, McDowell and Rose Poulter don't at least play together on Friday morning.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>4.03pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18519442\">daneng</a> asks: \"Olazabal reminds me of Langer in his time as captain.

Both are also very thorough. When players speak of the best captain they have worked under, Langer's name constantly crops up.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>4.10pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18518826\">TCtiger</a> asks: <strong>\"Do you think Monty's fears of a Brookline-style fervour in the crowd have justification?

I thought Monty's comments were a bit silly, not least bringing 9/11 into it.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>4.15pm: Ewan has signed off: </p> <blockquote> <p>Okay, thanks for all the questions... back to the longer form of writing for me. I have a piece on Justin Rose to write for tomorrow and of course the main preview of the Ryder Cup itself.

Mephedrone remains as popular as ecstasy among young people, with 3.3% of 16- to- 24-year-olds using it in the past year, but this is a decline since last year's survey showed 4.4% trying it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397019587\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/27/1348765364084/Illicit-drug-use-001.jpg\" alt=\"Illicit drug use\" width=\"220\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illicit drug use Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harry Shapiro, editor of Druglink magazine, said that for the first time since drugs became a political issue in the 1960s most ways of measuring suggested that drug use was now on a firm downward curve.</p> <p>In this month's issue, published on Thursday by Drugscope, an independent centre of drugs experts, he says the substantial increase in drug treatment, the economic between 2000-08, and the relative strength of modern day cannabis may all be factors.</p> <p>\"More generally, drug use having become more normalised in society, might then be just as prey to fashion as any other cultural artefact. Drugs don't appear to be 'cool' these days as they once were,\" writes Shapiro.</p> <p>He acknowledges that it is still a significant issue, with 300,000 serious problem drug users and rising youth unemployment, but \"to suggest, as some do, that we are currently going to a drug hell in a handcart is just a wilful refusal to acknowledge the facts\". Shapiro is particularly critical of politicians who repeatedly claim that drug use is spiralling out of control for their own purposes.</p> <p>The Home Office figures also show that the most commonly reported age for first taking cannabis is 16, with people first trying cocaine and ecstasy at 18. Most have stopped using cannabis by the time they are 18, and cocaine or ecstasy by 25. A very small minority continue to use cannabis throughout their lives, with some reporting they were still using the drug at 59.</p>",
  "<p>I used to joke to my friends that the only disadvantage of being a lesbian was missing out on all those toasters and crockery sets for wedding presents, but with the introduction of civil partnerships my world really is complete.</p> <p>But wait! Far more luxury items could be coming the way of one particular lesbian if only she would see sense and marry a man. Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, a Hong Kong tycoon, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/9567363/Hong-Kong-billionaire-offers-40-million-marriage-bounty-for-gay-daughter.html\" title=\"\">has offered \u00a340m to any man who can win the heart of his lesbian daughter</a>, according to the South China Morning Post. Gigi, however, is already taken, having apparently married her partner of seven years, Sean Eav, in France recently. But the union is not legal in China, so she is, in law, single.</p> <p>Chao seeks a kind-hearted and generous man for his daughter, whom he describes as talented and good looking, adding that she is devoted to her parents. I have to say, he is not going overboard with his marketing strategy, but perhaps the \u00a340m suffices?</p> <p>My first thought on reading this story was that Gigi could collude with a gay male friend who would present himself to the father as a man that likes a challenge and offer to turn his daughter to the joys of beard rash. After a few Mills &amp; Boon-like reluctant trysts, Gigi would tearfully admit to her father that she had fallen for her handsome prince and they would split the dosh, perhaps spending her half on an island to be used exclusively for lezzers, their quad bikes and tattoo parlours. His would undoubtedly be squandered on Paul Smith outfits and holidays in Mykonos.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that the beaus will be queuing round the block to woo Gigi, perhaps she should bite the bullet and think of the dosh. This is what I would look for in a man if it were I in this position:</p> <p>\u2022 He is off sex permanently and severely allergic to Viagra</p> <p>\u2022 He is so honourable that he insists on drawing up a will that leaves every penny of his fortune to me, and we open a joint bank account</p> <p>\u2022 Because I will be a recovering lesbian in need of daily therapy, he understands that my time will be taken up with back-to-back Hasbian Anonymous groups and I will barely be home. Often the sessions will be organised as overnight retreats with other women fighting similar demons</p> <p>\u2022 In order to ease the difficult transition for me from lezzer to housewife, he agrees to behave in a manner conducive to my former life, such as coming with me to women's tennis tournaments, KD Lang concerts and films about lesbian couples buying turkey basters in Ikea, in which we cry and argue every Saturday afternoon</p> <p>\u2022 He will be suitably attired in classic lezzer wear such as a tool belt and singlet at all times</p> <p>\u2022 He buys several cats and allows them to sleep in the bed</p> <p>It is kind of Chao to pay so much of his fortune towards helping his daughter see the light, but I am moved to offer him a few words of advice as to how he could better spend the \u00a340m. How about setting up retreats in beautiful surroundings around the world for unfortunate lesbians to take holidays, during which they can reflect on the errors of their ways while sipping champagne and soaking up the sun? Visiting men could turn up at regular intervals to pitch themselves at the women, just like those fellas that try to sell you double-glazing. After all, if it turns just one woman straight, Chao can be sure his fortune was well spent.</p>",
  "<p>A US air force systems analyst who expressed support for WikiLeaks and accused leaker Bradley Manning triggered a formal military investigation last year to determine whether she herself had leaked any documents to the group. <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/Assange-WikiLeaks-Enemy-USAF-FOI.pdf\">Air Force investigative documents</a>, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show that the analyst was repeatedly interviewed about her contacts with and support for WikiLeaks - what investigators repeatedly refer to as the \"anti-US or anti-military group\" - as well as her support for the group's founder, Julian Assange.</p> <p>The investigation was ultimately closed when they could find no evidence of unauthorized leaking, but what makes these documents noteworthy is the possible crime cited by military officials as the one they were investigating: namely, \"Communicating With the Enemy\", under <a href=\"http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm104.htm\">Article 104 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)</a>. </p> <p>That is one of the most serious crimes a person can commit - it carries the penalty of death - and is committed when a person engages in \"unauthorized communication, correspondence, or intercourse with the enemy\". The military investigation form also requires investigators to identify the \"victim\" of the crime they are investigating, and here, they designated \"society\" as the victim:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396781742\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348741861899/airforce.png\" alt=\"wikileaks investigation\" width=\"460\" height=\"268\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>How could leaking to WikiLeaks possibly constitute the crime of \"communicating with the enemy\"? Who exactly is the \"enemy\"? There are two possible answers to that question, both quite disturbing.</p> <p>The first possibility is the one suggested by <a href=\"http://m.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/us-calls-assange-enemy-of-state-20120927-26m7s.html\">today's Sydney Morning Herald article</a> on these documents (as well as <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/US-Military-Refers-to-Julian.html\">by WikiLeaks itself</a>): that the US military now formally characterizes WikiLeaks and Assange as an \"enemy\", the same designation it gives to groups such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban. This would not be the first time such sentiments were expressed by the US military: recall that one of the earliest leaks from the then-largely-unknown group was a secret report prepared back in 2008 by the US Army which, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/us/18wiki.html\">the New York Times put it</a>, included WikiLeaks on the Pentagon's \"list of the enemies threatening the security of the United States\". That Army document then <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/03/27/wikileaks/\">plotted how to destroy the group</a>. </p> <p>But it's the second possibility that seems to me to be the far more likely one: namely, that the US government, as part of Obama's <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones\">unprecedented war on whistleblowers</a>, has now fully embraced the pernicious theory that any leaks of classified information can constitute the crime of \"aiding the enemy\" or \"communicating with the enemy\" by virtue of the fact that, indirectly, \"the enemy\" will - like everyone else in the world - ultimately learn of what is disclosed. </p> <p>Indeed, the US military is currently prosecuting accused WikiLeaks leaker Bradley Manning on multiple charges <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41876046/ns/us_news-security\">including \"aiding the enemy\"</a>, also under Article 104 of the UCMJ, and a capital offense (though prosecutors are requesting \"only\" life imprisonment rather than execution). Military prosecutors <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/15/bradley-manning-wikileaks\">have since revealed</a> that their theory is that the 23-year-old Army Private \"aided al-Qaida by leaking hundreds of thousands of military and other government documents\" -- specifically, that \"Manning indirectly aided al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula by giving information to WikiLeaks.\"</p> <p>It seems clear that the US military now deems any leaks of classified information to constitute the capital offense of \"aiding the enemy\" or \"communicating with the enemy\" even if no information is passed directly to the \"enemy\" and there is no intent to aid or communicate with them. Merely informing the public about classified government activities now constitutes this capital crime because it \"indirectly\" informs the enemy. </p> <p>The implications of this theory are as obvious as they are disturbing. If someone can be charged with \"aiding\" or \"communicating with the enemy\" by virtue of leaking to WikiLeaks, then why wouldn't that same crime be committed by someone leaking classified information to any outlet: the New York Times, the Guardian, ABC News or anyone else? In other words, does this theory not inevitably and necessarily make all leaking of all classified information - whether to WikiLeaks or any media outlet - a capital offense: treason or a related crime? </p> <p>International Law Professor Kevin Jon Heller <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2011/03/02/did-bradley-manning-aid-the-enemy-did-the-new-york-times/\">made a similar point</a> when the charges against Manning were first revealed:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]f Manning has aided the enemy, so has any media organization that published the information he allegedly stole. Nothing in Article 104 requires proof that the defendant illegally acquired the information that aided the enemy. As a result, if the mere act of ensuring that harmful information is published on the internet qualifies either as indirectly 'giving intelligence to the enemy' (if the military can prove an enemy actually accessed the information) or as indirectly 'communicating with the enemy' (because any reasonable person knows that enemies can access information on the internet), there is no relevant factual difference between Manning and a media organization that published the relevant information.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Heller goes on to note that while \"WikiLeaks or the New York Times could not actually be charged under Article 104\" because \"the UCMJ only applies to soldiers\", there is nonetheless \"still something profoundly disturbing about the prospect of convicting Manning and sentencing him to life imprisonment for doing exactly what media organizations did, as well\".</p> <p>What these new documents reveal is that this odious theory is not confined to Manning. The US military appears to be treating all potential leaks - at least those to WikiLeaks - as \"aiding\" or \"communicating with\" the enemy. But there is no possible limiting principle that would confine that theory only to such leaks; they would necessarily apply to all leaks of classified information to any media outlets. </p> <p>It is always worth underscoring that the New York Times has published far more government secrets than WikiLeaks ever has, and more importantly, has published far more sensitive secrets than WikiLeaks has (unlike WikiLeaks, which has never published anything that was designated \"Top Secret\", the New York Times has repeatedly done so: the Pentagon Papers, the Bush NSA wiretapping program, the SWIFT banking surveillance system, and the cyberwarfare program aimed at Iran were all \"Top Secret\" when the newspaper revealed them, as was the network of CIA secret prisons exposed by the Washington Post). There is simply no way to convert basic leaks to WikiLeaks into capital offenses - as the Obama administration is plainly doing - without sweeping up all leaks into that attack.</p> <p>Of course, that outcome would almost certainly be a feature, not a bug, for Obama officials. This is, after all, the same administration that has prosecuted whistleblowers under <em>espionage charges</em> that threatened to send them to prison for life without any evidence of harm to national security, and has brought <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/business/media/white-house-uses-espionage-act-to-pursue-leak-cases-media-equation.html\">double the number of such prosecutions as all prior administrations combined</a>. Converting all leaks into capital offenses would be perfectly consistent with the unprecedented secrecy fixation on the part of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXWTdTnhebs\">Most Transparent Administration Ever</a>\u2122.</p> <p>The irony from these developments is glaring. The real \"enemies\" of American \"society\" are not those who seek to inform the American people about the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/24/wikileaks_23/\">bad acts engaged in by their government in secret</a>. As <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/10/the_liberal_betrayal_of_bradley_manning/\">Democrats once recognized</a> prior to the age of Obama - in the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/16/daniel-ellsberg-wikileaks_n_797801.html\">age of Daniel Ellsberg</a> - people who do that are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/14/bradley-manning-deserves-a-medal\">more aptly referred to as \"heroes\"</a>. The actual \"enemies\" are those who abuse secrecy powers to conceal government actions and to threaten with life imprisonment or even execution those who blow the whistle on high-level wrongdoing.</p>",

  "<p>n 1994, the charity <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/\">Barnardo's</a> set up the UK's first child sexual exploitation programme in Bradford. There are now 21 centres nationally, dedicated to turning around the lives of thousands of sexually exploited young people. All this began as a pilot project, developed into <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/children/nsfcasestudies.nsf/5084709fa3844fc680256f2c00339f59/28bdb53249f6fa2380256f6a003f240a?OpenDocument\">Streets and Lanes</a> working with child prostitutes, and is now known as <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/what_we_do/our_projects/sexual_exploitation/sexual_exploitation_case_studies_stories/relationships.htm\">Turnaround</a>.</p> <p>During the 1990s Bradford saw hundreds of young girls, some as young as 11, pimped out by older men who kept them in squalid bedsits. The average age of under-18 'working girls' (and boys) was just 14. Barnardo's demanded a change in the law to ensure that men who engaged in unlawful sex with children were charged and punished with the most serious of sexual offences instead of the minor offence of kerb crawling. </p> <p>Around the Thornton Road area of the city, local companies and residents complained when 'business' was affecting commerce. In 1999,The landlady of the Black Swan pub told the local <em>Telegraph &amp; Argus</em> that she lost 40% of her trade over three years when the area became known as a red light district. Barnardo's could not be sure of how many under-age girls were coerced into the sex industry because the majority of trade took place behind closed doors. Child prostitution still has close links to the drug trade, a form of diversification and 'business' expansion.</p> <p>Barnardo's campaigned to change the public perception of these young girls and for courts to take the trend in child prostitution seriously. Over time, the 'teenage vice girls' portrayal by much of the media in the 90s has been replaced by moral outrage at the calculating, predatory nature of sex gangs who 'groom' teenagers for sex. </p> <p>Kay Kelly, who has worked for the Bradford project for 12 years, looks back to her first years with Streets and Lanes: </p> <blockquote> <p>The reality wasn't recognised. These young people weren't seen as victims. They were very much seen as perpetrators themselves and treated as adult prostitutes.Of course they weren't because they were all under the legal age for consent. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>With reference to Rochdale, she says: </p> <blockquote> <p>It's good to see some convictions and that people are taking it more seriously, But the race argument detracts from the issue.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly has learned to look at each case individually:</p> <blockquote> <p>They're all so different. You can have that older male or female abusing one young person - that happens, but you can also get one male linked to lots of different young people or things run by a gang. </p> <p>I think that we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. There's lots more going on out there that we don't know about, but we're definitely going in the right direction. People are starting to see the young people as victims but we've still got lots to learn and it changes all the time.</p> </blockquote> <p>She lists warning signs which everyone can be aware of: </p> <blockquote> <p>If young people are going missing from home regularly, if they return home late, if they start missing school - sometimes they're exploited during the day when they are supposed to be in school.</p> <p>If they are starting to use drugs and alcohol, if they have lots of money and no explanation as to where that money has come from. Sometimes they are given gifts. Lots of secretive use of the internet, on the 'phone all night talking. Sometimes parents have got hold of 'phones and found there are quite explicit texts. People can find out about the indicators are if they log on to the <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/what_we_do/our_projects/sexual_exploitation.htm\">Barnardo's website here</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>She adds of another indicator:</p> <blockquote> <p>The rate of self harm is quite high and there are different levels of it, from superficial cutting to serious overdoses. Young people may be taken into care because the grooming process can completely break down the relationship between the parent and the child. Equally there are young people who are in care for other reasons and that makes them vulnerable too.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>For Kelly,the main message is this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Every young person is vulnerable. We can't stereotype \u2013 we've seen that each case is so different for young people and perpetrators . We don't want to fall into the trap that people think: 'This is what it looks like when a young person is being sexually exploited', because we might miss something. It's about being aware of the indicators and knowing where to go for some help and support. Barnardo's would much rather be contacted and someone be wrong than not do anything and for that young person to get really involved in it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Grooming often starts online, Kelly says: </p> <blockquote> <p>The number just gets passed around or the BBM pin. Sometimes they are contacted on Facebook \u2013 then that gets passed around to other people and they just get bombarded with messages. For an unsuspecting young person, it's extraordinarily powerful.</p> <p>There are instances where child pornography has been used as part of the grooming process. It does'nt happen all the time. Quite often you have SMART phones and it's 'Send me a picture of you in your underwear'. Next thing, that photo has been passed around to everybody, everybody is aware of it and once a photo is out there, it's out there. You don't have any control over it. The fear that parents or friends will find out can be enough to silence a child.</p> </blockquote> <p>Every day, Kay Kelly heads out into the streets or sits in her office as girl after girl, boy after boy describes their abuse. When high profile cases finally hit the headlines for a few weeks, she is still there listening, supporting and advising the children that have either escaped or been discarded. Children turn up with cigarette marks, burns, bite marks,threatened with knifes; torture which makes 'grooming' seem a completely inadequate word. She says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The perpetrators are so different, some will continue to use the children for as long as they possibly can. With others, as soon as the young person becomes known to various agencies, they become too much of a risk and they move on.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Barnardo's battle goes on, and is making progress. Kelly says: </p> <blockquote> <p>We have many success stories . We've worked with lots of young people who have gone onto exit programmes and made a recovery from exploitation who keep in touch and they are leading happy, fulfilling lives. It's possible to recover if they get the right support \u2013 we've seen it, and that's the best bit. There's light at the end of that tunnel.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Advice and Support in the North</strong></p> <p><em>The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre offer advice and guidance to children and parents <a href=\"http://www.thinkuknow.co.uk\">here</a>.

In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/sep/27/rochdale-child-sex-ring-children\">her second piece here</a>, she talks to young people out at night in a small North Yorkshire town, and unaware of the risks they run.</em></p>",
  "<p>It's 7 o'clock on a Thursday evening during the half-term holiday in a small market town in the middle of Yorkshire. I'm not naming the place for fear that it would attract the wrong sort, when there's a 'pop and crisps' night at the local nightclub.</p> <p>Kay Kelly from <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/get_involved/campaign/cutthemfree/sexual_exploitation_help_support/specialist_sexual_exploitation_projects.htm\">Barnardo's Turnaround</a> project, which works with children who are sexually exploited, knows about such times and places:</p> <blockquote> <p>The areas that are targeted are where young people hang out and are particularly vulnerable - under-16's discos and anywhere that predators know that there are lots of young people hanging around. Parents need to know what the vulnerabilities are; they need to know how to keep their kids safe.</p> <p>The high profile cases always seems to focus in on race and it really worries us, because a young person will go off with a white guy and think its okay. It's just so dangerous and we would urge people not to think about it in those terms but to think about as a child protection issue.</p> </blockquote> <p>Inside the club, hundreds of kids are chatting with friends and dancing their hearts out in more upmarket surroundings than the youth club down the road that the council had to close. It's always been the same \u2013 a scabby table tennis table and smelly community centre can't compare to the heady atmosphere of a club stinking of last night's happy hour. Tonight is much more lucrative \u2013 400 kids on high energy drinks at \u00a32.50 a pop. </p> <p>Just like on TV, the club distinguishes between punters and VIP's \u2013 for a fiver, 12-year-olds wannabes access all areas and the orange squash runs freely. </p> <p>Teenage girls in a place like this can have parents with deep pockets. A night like the one I'm visiting can gross several thousand pounds, mid week. Local taxi drivers wait in line for fares - night-time trade has been hit hard in this small northern town.<br> Outside, lots more kids have left the club and gathered in the picturesque streets. Local restaurant owners stand like sentries with their arms crossed and lips pursed, lost for words: Such young girls, they say, shouldn't be out dressed like that. No-one really understands what's going on. They've worked for years to build up businesses that depend on a certain kind of clientele who are visibly put off their food by scores of scantily-clad 12 and 13-year-olds acting leery.</p> <p>It's like closing time on a Friday night in any city centre, except that it's Thursday in a respectable part of Yorkshire and so many of those involved are under 16. A group of young girls are hysterical. A fight's broken out although no-one knows why. The explanation is that the girl who started swinging punches without warning is a drunk and disorderly 13-year-old who's had a fight with her boyfriend. None of her friends batted a false eyelash. </p> <p>The stench of alcohol is overpowering. It's in coke bottles and juice cartons, and it's obvious that a lot of these kids are as high as kites. What's not so obvious is why nothing is being done about it. One girls collapsed in the doorway of the club as bouncers attempt to locate her parents to collect her. Once they finally manage to shift her outside, it's a policing problem. They claim that older men buy the girls alcohol from the local supermarket. After all, they say, what man's going to refuse girls dressed like that.</p> <p>Quite a few I'd say, judging by the number of parents waiting nearby at closing time, waiting to whisk their offspring to the safety of the line of waiting BMWs and Audis. It's not that long since they did the same thing after DD's (netmums-speak for Darling Daughter)'s first day at school or dried her eyes when she'd fallen over at the playpark. Now its all boys, and makeup. The collection of dressing up clothes is still in a trunk at the bottom of her bed but she's given up Snow White and turned into a pop princess . </p> <p>Six-inch heels and padded bra from mum's wardrobe just looked funny and ridiculous when the girls were younger and tottering around at home playing dressing-up. Now the group of assembled mums don't know whether to laugh or cry; girls who don't want to be children but don't yet know what it means to be a woman have no idea how vulnerable they are. A 12-year-old girl tells me casually:</p> <blockquote> <p>losing your mobile phone is more problematic that losing your virginity these days.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Another nods, and says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most people lose theirs by the time they're 14, it's not a big deal.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But talk to them further and it's clear that this is bravado, what they feel appropriate to say. When I talk to them about the complexity of relationships, both agree that they want to wait until they are in a long-term relationship and that 'doing it upstairs at a party is just gross.'</p> <p>So here are the 'tweenies' - young teenagers - exposed to a highly sexualised commercial world in which young people are produced as an object of desire. They don't stop to think how few people live like the glossy ones on TV. At this age girls just want to have fun.</p> <p>The complexity and emotional instability involved is an obvious opening for child sex exploitation. A young boy \u2013 no more than 12 \u2013 asks me if I do pornography after inspecting my camera and organising a photoshoot on his mobile phone outside the takeaway. He looks confused when I say: No. He didn't understand why. The group of girls he was with agreed quietly that it was gross but without much conviction. Many had been asked to send topless photographs to boys in their Facebook group. No biggie.</p> <p>I'm happy photographing in difficult circumstances but the eagerness with which these kids approach me and begin to start posing is frightening and I beat a hasty retreat. I'm not going to cause them any harm but the next guy...who knows? I'm so worried, I'd contacted the local police a few days earlier leaving my details offering to let them check the frames. It's appreciated. Any photographer working around young people gives cause for concern these days, and knowing where I am and what I'm doing is one less thing for an already overstretched, predominantly rural police force to deal with.</p> <p>Popular culture shapes the attitudes and choices of our young people in ways that we cannot pretend are not disturbing. That was the lesson I took home. And Kay Kelly says:</p> <blockquote> <p>When I was young you used to stand outside off-licenses and if anyone went past you'd ask them to get a pack of fags or something. It's a normal part of development for young people to take risks and push the boundaries a bit. They want to go out. They want a bit of excitement \u2013 all those things but within that they want to be safe. And they need to be safe.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Advice and Support in the North</strong></p> <p><em>The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre offer advice and guidance to children and parents <a href=\"http://www.thinkuknow.co.uk\">here</a>.

  "<p>In an interview to promote her new book, <a href=\"http://gma.yahoo.com/j-k-rowlings-personal-struggle-ocd-informed-novel-171507083--abc-news-books.html\" title=\"\">JK Rowling has revealed</a> that one of the main characters has obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was based, she explained, on her own experience of the illness, which revolved around \"checking, double checking, triple checking things\". Hearing OCD talked about in a serious way, by a woman who obviously understands it well, comes as a pleasant surprise. It's a very different description of the illness from the one the actor Julianne Moore gave four years ago when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/06/features.culture\" title=\"\">she said</a>: \"Those are the indulgences you can have before you have children. Now I don't have time to obsess. All that stuff about, 'I need to go this certain way and do that' was an indulgence of my youth.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obsessive-compulsive-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">OCD</a> is a relatively new term, but the illness has been described accurately as far back as the 17th century. It is also a common anxiety disorder \u2013 the Royal College of Psychiatrists says that <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfoforall/problems/obsessivecompulsivedisorder/obsessivecomplusivedisorder.aspx\" title=\"\">one person in every 50</a> will suffer from some form of it in their lifetime, but the serious aspects of it are little understood by the general public. Stories about OCD in the media often mistakenly interpret a superstitious nature, or an obsessive tendency for order, as the definitive signs of OCD. How often do you hear a friend refer to themselves as \"a little bit OCD\", when really all they mean is that they like to colour co-ordinate their sock drawer?</p> <p>It's frustrating to hear interviews with people who discuss OCD as though it were a minor quirk, rather than an all-encompassing pit of worry (an example of this is a story about <a href=\"http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/top-ten/2011-06-23/sports-superstitions-beckhams-ocd-rebecca-adlingtons-even-numbers-nadals-water-bottles-and-more\" title=\"\">David Beckham</a> needing to line up all the drinks cans in his fridge). While you may read about neat drawers pretty often, there is very little mention of the terrible thoughts that people with OCD grapple with. The executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.ocfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">International OCD Foundation</a>, Jeff Szymanski, says that the term OCD is often used erroneously: \"What you have seen in the media and pop culture is a rise in people misusing the term OCD. What they really mean is they are obsessive or compulsive. But they don't qualify for an anxiety disorder, which is what OCD is.\"</p> <p>People with obsessive-compulsive disorder often develop rituals to deal with the upsetting thoughts they're having. A person worried about illness might become terrified of picking up germs, and so take to washing their hands hundreds of times a day. These rituals provide a sense of control, a short relief, but don't deal with the deeper issues.</p> <p>From my own experience, I found that OCD can also take a purely obsessional form, and sufferers find their thoughts fixating on all manner of topics. During the worst of this anxiety, I spent every waking moment in thrall to my racing mind, and the irrational thoughts that are the terrible hallmarks of OCD. Songs, images and phrases would stick in my head, like a skipping record player. I found that if you try to push out these intrusions, your mind cleverly adapts and comes back with even more frightening scenarios.</p> <p>Szymanski says that this technique of repression is widely known to be unhelpful: \"Thought suppression actually increases the frequency and intensity of those thoughts. A lot of avoidance behaviours are just as detrimental as traditional compulsive behaviours.\"</p> <p>Luckily, OCD can be helped with a huge variety of different medications and therapies. With help, I've found it is possible to overcome the thoughts and compulsions, and so it's great to hear about someone as successful as JK Rowling tackling it so well. The ignorance that surrounds mental illness often means that people don't seek help when they most need it. Huge progress has been made to try and remove the stigma from mental illnesses such as depression, now the same must be done for anxiety disorders. Let's hope the dated colour-coded sock drawer myth is on its way out.</p>",
  "<p>Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond have signed a new three-year deal to continue fronting the hit BBC2 car show.</p> <p>The new deal is likely to involve a substantial windfall for Clarkson and the programme's producer Andy Wilman because BBC Worldwide has taken full control of their lucrative Bedder 6 joint venture, which owns the commercial rights to the show and which has paid the duo millions of pounds in dividends.</p> <p>Clarkson had become the highest-paid BBC star on the back of his 30% stake in Bedder 6, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/16/top-gear-jeremy-clarkson?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">earning more than \u00a33m in the year to March 2012</a>. Wilman \u2013 a schoolfriend of Clarkson's \u2013 owned 20% and the corporation the remainder.</p> <p>Bedder 6 made \u00a315.2m in pre-tax profits in the year to March 2011, such is the success of the company, which generates income from Top Gear live shows, DVDs and international exploitation of the brand. Its profitability means that the business could be valued at between \u00a350m and \u00a3100m \u2013 although the structure of the BBC takeover is unknown.</p> <p>However, Clarkson and Wilman resigned as directors of Bedder 6, which handled merchandising spin-offs and international versions of the show, two weeks ago.</p> <p>BBC Worldwide will increase its stake in Bedder 6 to 100% but the corporation said it is commercially confidential how much Clarkson and Wilman will be compensated for giving up their valuable shareholdings.</p> <p>Under the new deal, May and Hammond will get a share of Top Gear commercial revenue generated by BBC Worldwide, in return for promoting the show around the world. However, the money will be paid to them directly by BBC Worldwide, not channelled via a separate company.</p> <p>In July it emerged that Clarkson's income from the motoring programme was boosted by \u00a3900,000 to \u00a32.7m in the year to the end of March after dividends from Bedder 6 increased from \u00a39m from \u00a36m the previous year. Added to his Bedder 6 fee of \u00a3350,000 and talent fee from the BBC, believed to be just under \u00a3500,000, this took the total Clarkson earned from Top Gear to more than \u00a33m.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/08/jeremyclarkson.bbc\" title=\"\">Bedder 6 was set up five years ago</a> to allow Clarkson and Wilman to make money from the commercial exploitation of the Top Gear brand, without inflating the salary the presenter receives from the licence fee for fronting the popular BBC2 car show.</p> <p>There has been speculation that representatives of fellow Top Gear presenters James May and Richard Hammond were concerned that the pair were missing out on a share of the DVD sales and income from live shows that went into Bedder 6.</p> <p>The popularity of Top Gear around the world means Clarkson and Wilman have benefited hugely, at a time when other BBC talent pay has been reduced due to cuts in the licence fee.</p> <p>A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: \"\"BBC Worldwide has agreed new commercial deals with Jeremy, James, Richard and Andy to secure Top Gear's international future for another three years. This agreement secures the commercial future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world, reinvest in Top Gear and return profits to the BBC.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The average business energy bill is now \u00a32600.79, <a href=\"http://www.businessjuice.co.uk/energy-forecaster/latest-forecast/post/32322752223/are-businesses-wasting-money-to-save-time\" title=\"\">which represents 0.39% of total turnover</a>. With the economy in its current state, it is no surprise that businesses are tightening their belts wherever possible. This can lead to anything from staff cuts, to less office space, to slashed training budgets \u2013 but businesses should also be looking at the smaller things closer to home in order to reduce costs.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.businessjuice.co.uk/energy-forecaster\" title=\"\">Energy Forecaster</a>, we have devised 10 useful tips to cut energy waste and save money:</p> <p><strong>Turn off computers at night</strong></p> <p>We've all been guilty of it \u2013 needing a quick exit or a quick start in the morning. But leaving computers on overnight can be extremely costly for a business. Ensure that the last person to leave each night does a monitor check.</p> <p><strong>DIY insulation </strong></p> <p>Improving a building's insulation and sealing air leaks are the fastest and most cost-effective ways to reduce energy waste. If you can't afford to have professional insulation installed, there are a few cheap tricks you can use. Try sticking bubble wrap to your windows (in place of double-glazing) or sewing your own draught-excluders for leaky doors and window frames.</p> <p><strong>Charity donations</strong></p> <p>Set a rule that if staff wish to charge their mobile phones at work, they must donate a minimum sum to charity. This is a win-win situation; either it will act as a deterrent to staff and help save your business energy, or you will raise a significant amount of money for a charity of your choice.</p> <p><strong>Encourage staff to work from home one day a week/month </strong></p> <p>This will be even more effective if it is possible and practical for everyone to work from home on the same day of the week and you can close your office completely. Often members of staff are more productive while working from home.</p> <p><strong>Keep fridges away from heaters</strong></p> <p>Something you may not have considered before is how one appliance's energy use may be affected by another. For example, if your fridge or freezer is next to a hot appliance, such as a radiator, then it has to work even harder to keep your food at the right temperature. This means it will use more energy and cost you more money, so think carefully about where you put your appliances in your kitchen to avoid unnecessary costs.</p> <p><strong>Consider your hot water use</strong></p> <p>Gradually turn down the temperature on the hot water heater until you reach the point where it's not quite hot enough, then turn it back up one notch, to make sure your water is not hotter than it needs to be. You can also wrap the hot water tank in your office with insulation to reduce any heat loss from the tank itself.</p> <p><strong>Consider energy saving a competition</strong></p> <p>You could consider getting staff involved. For example, alternate which member of staff is in charge of energy saving each week and take meter readings to see who can cut your usage by the most. Offer a prize for the winner. A cheap energy monitor will help to make your consumption more visible. This approach will give your employees an incentive to think about where they might be wasting energy. Getting others involved will generate ideas for saving energy that you'd never have thought of.</p> <p><strong>Clean light fixtures regularly</strong></p> <p>Make sure that bulbs, fixtures, lenses, lamps and reflective surfaces are cleaned regularly. Removing grease, dust and other dirt can increase the output of your lights significantly.</p> <p><strong>Go for group tea rounds </strong></p> <p>Everyone dreads doing the drinks run, but often an over-filled kettle is boiled repeatedly throughout the day. Instead float the idea of having a group tea rounds \u2013 make tea for more staff at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Turn the thermostat down</strong></p> <p>It may not seem like much, but even reducing the temperature in your office by 1\u00b0C could cut your heating bills by up to 10%.</p> <p>\u2022 See our guides to <a href=\"http://www.businessjuice.co.uk/energy-forecaster/guides/energy-efficiency\" title=\"\">energy-efficiency</a> and <a href=\"http://www.businessjuice.co.uk/energy-forecaster/guides/energy-management\" title=\"\">energy management</a> for more tips and advice.</p> <p><em>James Constant is the managing director of</em><a href=\"http://www.businessjuice.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em> Business Juice</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Twisted, buckled and puckered leaves, bulging yellow veins and contorted growth going nowhere: damage by weedkiller residue is back. It never really went away, but its comeback promises even more widespread harm, and this time it's being egged on by journalism that could prove as harmful as the weedkiller itself.</p> <p>Since 2008, when reports of something nasty lurking in animal manure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/29/food.agriculture\">first appeared</a>, a steady flow of new incidents of pollution caused by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminopyralid \">aminopyralid</a> have surfaced. This synthetic hormone weedkiller kills broad-leaved plants, by sending plant cells into a frenzy, but leaves grass unharmed, although it does enter it, binding to its fibres. If a cow or horse eats treated grass (fresh or as hay) the residue passes through the animal's gut, becoming the manure we crave. If that muck arrives on an allotment site, or is sold bagged in garden centres, there's trouble ahead.</p> <p>When we mix it into our soil and it rots, minuscule polluting traces of aminopyralid are set free, and sensitive plants, including potatoes, tomatoes, peas and beans, start to <a href=\"http://www.geologywales.co.uk/storms/summer-2011-aminopyralid.htm\">pucker, buckle and twist</a>, as their leaves and shoots go haywire. A deserved hoo-ha tightened the rules on aminopyralid's use, which should never have gotten into muck to start with.<br>But aminopyralid isn't the next chemical casting its long polluter's shadow across our plots, although it works in the same way, causes the same deformed growth, and is equally persistent. Its carrier isn't poisoned manure, but bags of contaminated compost and soil improver. Its origin isn't distant sprayed fields, but our own lawns. Move over aminopyralid, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopyralid\">clopyralid</a>, found in some <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/media/pdfs/advice/WeedkillersForGardeners\">garden lawn weedkillers</a>, is the new home-grown polluter.</p> <p>The Sun newspaper's gardening column recently ran a story headlined \"Binfection\", with a dramatic opener: \"Disturbing reports reach us of weedkiller pollution in composts and manure.\" They got the pollution bit right, but the rest looks like a masterclass in agenda, rather than fact-driven journalism.</p> <p>The Sun tells us \"homeowners dump weedkiller-polluted mowings and diseased plant material in roadside bins and, where this is composted ... there is a risk infected material will result\". In fact, collected garden waste is composted, professionally, <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/bsi-pas-100-compost-specification\">to exacting standards</a> (and to high, disease-killing temperatures). Disease outbreaks arising from bought sowing, potting and multipurpose mixes containing composted green waste are rare. And \"weedkiller-polluted mowings\" are just that: pollution, not \"infection\".</p> <p>More drama: \"Mad cow disease resulted from feeding cattle infected food. But now we are raising plants in infected growing media rather than sterile peat or coir-based seed and potting composts.\" This skips the fact that mad cow disease resulted from plant-eating cows being fed on other dead cows. It's a terrible analogy - gardeners grow new plants using the composted remains of dead ones - but it's fine for scaremongering.</p> <p>Having been hit myself by it, I recently researched an <a href=\"http://www.hartley-botanic.co.uk/gardening-tips/john-walker/gardenings-own-goal/\">article</a> on weedkiller residue. Reports and pictures on the perils of aminopyralid and clopyralid pollution <a href=\"http://glallotments.co.uk/acmanure.html\">abound</a>. There is no question of how damaging these chemicals are, how they cause damage, or what it looks like.</p> <p>The Sun's article failed to mention by name aminopyralid or, crucially, clopyralid. It did not list lawn weedkillers containing clopyralid, so readers could check if they're using it. By neglecting to remind its readers to <a href=\"http://www.lovethegarden.com/files/ve-label.pdf\">not put clopyralid-treated lawn mowings out for collection</a>, it failed to help prevent it entering the compost-making stream. It failed to moot the idea that we can defuse this time bomb by calling for clopyralid's withdrawal. And it ignored a painful lesson which American gardeners learned long ago - when they were hit by clopyralid residue - which led to it being withdrawn there in 2002.</p> <p>Two weeks later, another headline: \"Weedkiller on loose: polluted compost is blight\". This second helping serves gardeners no better. It tells us: \"You have now written in with a series of related cautionary tales.\" Curiously, out of the six snippets taken from readers' letters, none describe specific symptoms of weedkiller damage, but do name other symptoms, including those of gardening in the most challenging summer ever.</p> <p>Again, The Sun tells us of the perils of using products containing green waste compost, but fails to mention that it's used not just in some peat-free compost, but in some peat-reduced products, too. It can't resist more unfounded alarmism, suggesting that green waste compost might carry \"...bacterial infections such as Legionnaire's disease.\" There is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18206191\">no evidence</a> that anyone in the UK has caught the rare Legionella longbeachae from bagged compost.</p> <p>Again it fails to mention clopyralid or list the products containing it, does not urge readers to check if it's in their lawn weedkiller or remind them not to put treated mowings out for collection. And it fails to call, after learning others' lessons, for an end to clopyralid use in gardens. Why?</p> <p>The Sun's gardening column is a proponent of peat use, thereby encouraging the destructive mining of lowland raised peat bogs, primarily in Ireland and Europe. Peat is a <a href=\"http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~linda%20chalker-scott/horticultural%20myths_files/Myths/Horticultural%20%20peat.pdf\">non-renewable resource</a>. The Sun rails against the reliability of peat-free composts, many of which contain the composted green waste it is making great efforts to scare us about. So it's no surprise we're being urged to use \"...sterile peat or coir-based composts\".</p> <p>Peat-free composts may not be perfect, but they can be made from renewable resources, including what goes into our garden waste bins. I have <a href=\"http://earthfriendlygardener.net/2012/09/03/peat-free-reduced-compost-sowing-potting-multipurpose-recommend-top-choice-advice-using/\">trialled</a> over 30 peat-free composts this year, some of which contain or are made from green waste. The majority have performed just as well, if not better, than composts containing mined peat.</p> <p>Being a loyal champion of garden chemical use may explain why The Sun finds it hard to name the lawn weedkillers from which this entire problem springs. If the reporting of a serious problem is being tainted by an agenda, journalism is being distorted just as weedkiller residues twist plant growth. It's a kind of insidious pollution itself, symptomised by a clear failure to give gardeners the facts, while milking alarmism to the full.</p>",
  "<p>Part of Guardian News and Media's (GNM) sustainability vision is to be carbon positive, and we seek to move towards this long-term goal by maximising the influence of our editorial while at the same time minimising the negative impacts of our operations and business activities.</p> <p>Because we cannot measure our progress by quantitative metrics alone, it is not a firm target that we can say we will achieve by a certain date. We also recognise that changes in technology as well as legislation may affect our progress.</p> <p>However, it does set a clear direction for our sustainability strategy, and makes clear that the influence of our editorial content, or \"brainprint\", is key to our impact on society.</p> <p>Within editorial, carbon positive means using our open and collaborative approach to journalism to reach and engage with a global audience on issues ranging from climate change and resource use to biodiversity and social justice. We do this within our general news coverage but also through a number of our specialist websites. These include environment, global development, Guardian Sustainable Business, society and education. </p> <p>By educating and informing our global audience, we hope to help create the necessary conditions for political and social change.</p> <p>Of course, it is also important that we operate ourselves in the way we would wish to see others work. The Guardian has for many years been reducing its own footprint across its operations, ranging from offices and print sites to the newsprint the company purchases.</p> <p>Ensuring continued progress becomes more difficult now that the most obvious actions have been taken. GNM is also facing new challenges with the company's drive to become digital-first.</p> <p>For these reasons, GNM last year decided to review where it had got to and to put a more cohesive framework in place to ensure we are concentrating on the most important issues and are able to more effectively measure our progress. This has resulted in the creation of a carbon inventory to understand what data we do and don't collect as well as setting out the principles and rules for measuring our own performance.</p> <p>The framework is based on the following principles:</p> <ul> <li>We accept we do not have perfect knowledge or control over our impacts.</li> <li>We will set inventory boundaries according to our knowledge and resources.</li> <li>We will try to achieve best practice and encourage positive change within these borders.</li> <li>We intend to continually expand our boundaries of knowledge and influence to make better business decisions that support global sustainability.</li> </ul> <p>GNM uses the latest version of the international <a href=\"www.ghgprotocol.org/files/ghgp/public/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf\">Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative </a> (Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard1) as a guide in setting the framework of its greenhouse gas inventory. </p> <p>A review of the processes and activities undertaken at GNM has been mapped to identify where they are linked with the generation of greenhouse gases across the whole life cycle. The aim was to set out all the activities that are directly and indirectly related to GNM business processes covering traditional print media, digital media, as well as other commercial media and retail.</p> <p>It is assumed that these activities may generate GHG emissions as a result of the material inputs they draw into the system, the processing or activity itself, the intended outputs and any waste generated. </p> <p>As a result of this mapping, it was feasible to group GNM activities into five distinct areas or stages that occur within the media process and therefore form GNM's Media Life Cycle:</p> <p>Creation of editorial and commercial content and the development of media and commercial concept </p> <p>Production of the media or concept into a format or output that can be distributed to the consumer/audience </p> <p>Delivery of the media or output to consumer/audience for access or purchase</p> <p>Use and consumption of media or outputs by customer/audience</p> <p>Enable the customer/audience to take a direct action, inform opinion or behaviour change through the consumption of media or outputs</p> <p>While the process map provides a comprehensive picture of GNM's potential total carbon footprint, it is not realistic to maintain a carbon inventory that includes all emission sources. In line with best practice, GNM has set an initial inventory boundary that seeks to cover its primary emission sources. The aim is to progressively expand the boundary over consecutive years. </p> <p>In selecting emission sources for inclusion in the inventory, GNM has weighed a number of factors: </p> <ul> <li>Risk \u2013 the carbon intensity of the activity and stakeholder expectation</li> <li>Availability \u2013 the likely availability, quality and reliability of data</li> <li>Opportunity \u2013 the time and resources available to pursue this data</li> </ul> <p>Once the sources were prioritised, they were then categorised into four time boundaries or milestones for data collection or inclusion in the inventory.</p> <p>As a result of this body of work, GNM is going to concentrate on the following activities or emission/waste sources over the next one to three years:</p> <p><strong>Process</strong> (carbon) <br></p> <ul> <li>Contracted data centres and servers (CDNs) used to deliver online products</li> <li>Internet network and associated infrastructure, including use of consumer devices</li> <li>Display marketing, such as TV ads and posters</li> <li>Other transport steps (eg, distribution of contract print)</li> <li>Understanding the options and feasibility of measuring the impact our media content and services or brainprint</li> </ul> <p><strong>Material inputs</strong> (resources) <br></p> <ul> <li>Ink consumption at the print sites and contract printers</li> <li>Water consumption and disposal at offices, paper mills, GPCs and contract print sites</li> </ul> <p><strong>End of life</strong> (waste) <br></p> <ul> <li>The disposal of office and print waste to landfill/incineration and hazardous waste</li> <li>Recycling of paper and material at the print sites</li> </ul>",

  "<p>The past year has been among the most extraordinary in our history. We have broken stories that have shaped the news agenda around the world and, in doing so, built a global audience for our journalism that is larger and more active than could have been imagined just a few years ago. </p> <p>We have successfully embarked on a long-term transformation strategy that will see us not just survive the inexorable shift from print to digital but thrive as a result of it. We have made the idea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/open-journalism\">Open journalism</a> \u2013 journalism that is enriched by the direct contribution of readers \u2013 a reality.</p> <p>However, for all of our achievements, Guardian News and Media (GNM) continues to face some daunting challenges. Along with all other newspaper publishers, we are driving into fierce financial headwinds caused by the decline of revenues from print sales and advertising. The regulation and legislation that governs our industry is under such intense scrutiny (in large part due to the results of our own work) that it would not an exaggeration to suggest that a battle is raging for the soul of journalism here and around the world. As our audience grows, so does the challenge of staying true to our progressive, liberal values while reflecting a broad range of opinions.</p> <p>In order to ensure that we meet these challenges, in 2011 GNM embarked on a five-year transformation strategy designed to ensure that the business is sustainable financially and able to make the most of the opportunities presented by the various digital platforms.</p> <p>GNM's unique ownership structure \u2013 which ensures it is free of proprietorial or market influence \u2013 means that profit is not our motive. However, we do need to ensure that we are commercially viable and that GNM can easily be sustained by its parent company, <a href=\"http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/\">Guardian Media Group</a>. </p> <p>One year into the transformation strategy, GNM is performing as planned. Digital revenues grew by over 16% in the financial year ending 1 April 2012 to \u00a345.7m, largely offsetting the decline in print revenues for the first time. But the costs involved in creating new digital platforms and ways of working pushed the organisation to an operating loss before exceptional items and amortisation of \u00a344.2m. Details of the financial performance of GNM and parent company Guardian Media Group (GMG) are available in the company's <a href=\"http://www.gmgannualreview2012.co.uk/\">annual report</a>. </p> <p>This loss was expected at this stage of the plan, and the growth in digital revenue demonstrates the potential of the new platforms we are developing, but the financial challenge remains clear. In order to help us meet that, the five-year plan calls for GNM to make sustainable cost savings of \u00a325m by 2017, and that has led to difficult decisions being made about spending priorities and to the departure of some valued colleagues.</p> <p>The savings we are making are not simply cuts to spending; they let us invest in the future of our publications. Over the past year, we have reinvented the Monday-to-Friday newspaper and beefed up our digital development and digital sales teams. We have pioneered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog\">live blogging</a> and opened up our newsroom and launched a number of highly popular digital products \u2013 including apps for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/iphone/guardian\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/ipad/guardian-ipad-edition\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/android/guardian\">Android</a> and <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/\">Facebook</a> \u2013 to expand our reach, find new ways of growing and involving our audiences and build new revenue streams. </p> <p>We have attracted more than 200,000 members to our professional networks and we've begun a digital-only operation in the US, which is already exceeding its audience targets.</p> <p>As a result of this innovative approach, we are seeing rapid growth in digital audiences. Our iPad app was downloaded more than 800,000 times in the year ending March 2012. The Facebook app was installed 9.4m times over the same period, bringing our content to a new, younger audience. </p> <p>Our website, theguardian.com, enjoyed an audience of 67.8m monthly unique browsers, a 38% growth on March 2011, and our mobile site reaches more than 8m unique browsers a month. Independent third-party research data released in March 2012 showed that, in Britain, the unduplicated combined weekly print and digital readership of the Guardian and The Observer reached 5.8m in the calendar year 2011, exceeding that of The Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for the first time.</p> <p>So, beyond fulfilling our core purpose of holding power to account, we continue to lead the way in the development of a new form of journalism that puts our audience at the heart of what we do. Our approach to this is encapsulated in our commitment to Open journalism.</p> <p>In essence, we believe in the open exchange of information, ideas and opinions and its power to bring about change. We also champion open, connected networks (of news, comment and data), which combine journalistic skills with the best of what others create.</p> <p>This has many forms of expression, ranging from opening up our content to comments and collaborating with our users on complex investigations, to inviting thousands of readers into the Guardian for our unique <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/open-weekend\">Open Weekend</a>. </p> <p>While we want to be open, we also recognise that our aim is not to be all things to all people but to support those progressive individuals around the world who share our liberal values.</p> <p>Those values are what set us apart. They infuse everything we do, and we recognise the importance of staying true to them. This is why it is important that we create the report you are reading now, Living our Values. Our integrity and the trust of our readers is based not only on what we present to the outside world but how we operate. </p> <p>This is the 10th anniversary of our sustainability reporting, and the reason for engaging in this work is perhaps even more relevant now than it was then, given the complexity of the media world and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry\">Leveson inquiry</a> into the ethics of the fourth estate.</p> <p>In the inaugural report for 2002-03 editor-in-chief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a> wrote: \"Given that we produce progressive and enlightened newspapers, as well as write regularly about corporate social responsibility, we also wanted to reassure ourselves and others that we measure up to the high standards our editorials expect of other companies.\"</p> <p>The Guardian was the first media company to have its sustainability report independently audited, because we believe that we should offer our stakeholders the same level of scrutiny of our performance as we expect from others.</p> <p>We are delighted that our method of accountability has been acclaimed by an academic study that suggests it offers a method of self-regulation that other media companies would do well to follow.</p> <p>For example, a study by the school of journalism at the Southern Illinois University Carbondale concludes that \"it is difficult not to be impressed by the comprehensiveness of the Guardian's sustainability effort and the degree of transparency with which it has been communicated to stakeholders\".</p> <p>The Guardian has also led the way in creating other ways in which we can be held to account, such as the independent readers' editors in place at both the Guardian and the Observer.</p> <p>The prospects for news companies across the world are uncertain, and most traditional media companies are struggling to cope with the transformation of the industry. Many have slashed their editorial budgets and closed their news bureaux around the world.</p> <p>Guardian News and Media is fortunate that it started its transition to a digital business ahead of many of its competitors, which means that a quarter of its total revenues now come from its non-traditional operations.</p> <p>But we recognise the road ahead will continue to be chaotic, complex and fast-moving, and we will need to remain on our toes to meet the challenges ahead. We're not pretending to have all the answers. But, unlike many of our traditional newspaper competitors, we believe we have an inspiring vision for the future of our journalism, a unique and powerful brand proposition, and a robust and clearly articulated strategy for achieving our aims. Which means that, in an ever more crowded, converged and commoditised media world, the Guardian occupies a clear space of its own.</p>",

If it works, and the Lib Dems remain in government after 2015 (at a conference fringe I heard one speaker joking about young people in 2020 talking about having lived all their adult lives \"under a Lib Dem government), Clegg will be seen as one of the great political figures of our age.

Stubborn and principled, they ignored the cynics who mocked them. They simply refused to give up on their dreams. They refused to accept that Liberals would never again be in government. And they refused to accept that Liberalism, that most decent, enlightened and British of creeds, which did so much to shape our past, would not shape our future. We think we\u2019ve got it tough now. But it was much, much tougher in their day. It was only their resolve, their resilience and their unwavering determination that kept the flickering flame of Liberalism alive through our party\u2019s darkest days.</p> <p>At our last conference in Gateshead, I urged you to stop looking in the rear view mirror as we journey from the party of opposition that we were, to the party of government we are becoming. But before we head off on the next stage of our journey, I want you to take one last look in that mirror to see how far we\u2019ve come. I tell you what I see.</p> <p>I see generations of Liberals marching towards the sound of gunfire. And yes, I see them going back to their constituencies to prepare for government. It took us a while but we got there in the end.</p> </blockquote> <p>Younger colleagues were wondering why Clegg started going on about \"the sound of gunfire\".

They never flinched, and nor should we. We owe it to them to seize the opportunity they gave us, but which they never had. Taking on the vested interests. Refusing to be bullied. Refusing to give up. Always overturning the odds. Fighting for what we believe in, because we know that nothing worthwhile can be won without a battle. A fair, free and open society. That\u2019s the prize.

It's embargoed until 3pm, which means I'm now free to publish. So, here goes...</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg said he would not allow the top rate of income tax to be cut below 45% during this parliament.</strong> When George Osborne announced it was being cut from 50% to 45% in the spring budget, many Tories expressed the hope that this would be the first step towards getting it down to 40%, the level it used to be before Labour raised it during the credit crunch. Osborne reportedly wanted to take it down to 40% in one go. But Clegg said he would not accept any further change before 2015.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p \u2013 a level, let\u2019s not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour\u2019s 13 years in office \u2013 there can be no question of reducing it further in this parliament. All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on? It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 But he defended the decision to cut the top rate of income tax from 50% to 45% in the spring budget.</strong> He said he had \u201cinsisted\u201d on getting an increase in the tax allowance into the budget and that he had \u201cconceded\u201d the top rate tax cut. But he said he stood by the decision as a whole.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Why? Because as liberals, we want to see the tax on work reduced, the tax on unearned wealth increased, and the system as a whole tilted in favour of those on low and middle incomes. The budget delivered all three.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He announced that Paddy Ashdown will return to the Lib Dem frontline, taking charge of the party's 2015 election campaign.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can announce today that Paddy Ashdown has agreed to front up our campaign as chair of the 2015 general election team. I must admit, I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019m ready for all those urgent emails and 5am phone calls. But I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather have by my side. Paddy, it\u2019s great to have you back.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems should stop speculating about what they might do in the event of a hung parliament because this was ultimately a decision for the electorate.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the fringe of this conference about our party\u2019s next steps; about our relationship with the other parties; and about what we should do in the event of another hung parliament. It\u2019s the sort of discussion politicians love \u2013 full of speculation and rumour. But I have to tell you, it is all based on a false, and deeply illiberal, assumption: that it is we, rather than the people, who get to decide. In a democracy, politicians take their orders from the voters.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that the Lib Dems were the only party who could be trusted on the economy and trust to deliver a fairer society.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused Labour, and particularly Ed Balls, of financial irresponsibility</strong>. Balls was mentioned three times, while Ed Miliband was not mentioned at all. Clegg claimed that the poor suffered the most as a result of Labour's mismanagement of the economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour may have thought it was funny, after crashing the economy and racking up record debts, to leave a note on David Laws\u2019 desk saying: \u201cthere\u2019s no money left\u201d. But it\u2019s no joke for the most vulnerable in our society; the people Labour claim to represent but let down the most. So let\u2019s take no more lectures about betrayal. It was Labour who plunged us into austerity and it is we, the Liberal Democrats, who will get us out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he accused Balls of offering \u201ca fantasy world where there is no 'boom and bust' and the money never runs out\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He also attacked Conservatives who believe deregulation is the best solution to the country's economic problems.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The idea that if government just deregulated a bit more as Liam Fox proposes, or borrowed and spent a bit more as Ed Balls proposes, we would, at a stroke, achieve strong and lasting growth, is just not credible. In my experience, if you\u2019re being attacked by Liam Fox from one side, and Ed Balls from the other, you\u2019re in the right place.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government was willing to act \u201cagain and again and again\u201d to get growth going.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Plan A really was as rigid and dogmatic as our critics claim, I\u2019d be demanding a Plan B, and getting Danny and Vince to design it. But it isn\u2019t. Which is why you were right, earlier this week, to overwhelmingly reject the call for us to change our economic course. We have taken big and bold steps to support demand and boost growth. And we stand ready to do so again and again and again until self-sustaining growth returns.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He launched a veiled attack on the Conservatives for not fully supporting green growth.</strong> The Lib Dems would \u201chold [the Conservatives] to their promises\u201d on the environment, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will not succeed in this last task unless we can see off that most short-sighted of arguments: that we have to choose between going green and going for growth. Decarbonising our economy isn\u2019t just the right thing to do; it\u2019s a fantastic economic opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that austerity was essential because, if Britain lost control of its finances, it would lose its independence</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the coming years, some countries will get their own house in order. But some will not. Those that do will continue to write their own budgets, set their own priorities and shape their own futures. But those that do not will find their right to self-determination withdrawn by the markets, and new rules imposed by their creditors, without warning or clemency.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He suggested that welfare spending was too high.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the things about governing is it forces you to confront the inconvenient truths oppositions choose to ignore. Like the fact that, over the last 50 years, our economy has grown threefold, but our welfare spending is up sevenfold.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He defined liberalism as giving people \u201cthe freedom to be who you are, the opportunity to be who you could be\u201d.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems must give up being a party of protest.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that there are some in the party \u2013 some in this hall even \u2013 who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from right and left, as we work every day to keep this government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He confirmed that the government would give secondary schools a \u201ccatch-up premium\u201d, allowing them to spend \u00a3500 on help for children arriving from primary who are behind in English or maths.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that extremists could take over in the west if governments responded in the wrong way to the threat posed by the global power shift.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The potential consequences of this shift in power, should we in the west fail to respond, cannot be overstated. Our influence in the world, our standard of living, our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance \u2013 all are in the balance. For power would move not only away from the liberal and democratic world, but within it too; from moderates to hardliners, from internationalists to isolationists, from those committed to the politics of cooperation to those hell-bent on confrontation. If history has taught us anything, it is that extremists thrive in tough times.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked the \u201cculture of instant celebrity\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For most people, success doesn\u2019t come easy or quick. That\u2019s what our culture of instant celebrity obscures: that real achievement in the real world takes time, effort, perseverance, resilience.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T14:39:52.662Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-506308f6c0e327c3f7c905f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T13:53:58.777Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's Elaine Woodard, from Meon Valley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8JZYdFe5Tfc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506308b058f9bdd2eeba0288\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T13:52:48.832Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Helene Mulholland</strong> has been talking to delegates about how the conference has gone.

Or not. \"Does it work, or if it does work does it have so many negative consequences we shouldn't do it any more?\" posed Cable. \"At some point in the next few months the question will arise, unless growth spontaneously returns, do you do more of it, [and] how do you do it?\"</p> <p>At the same event, John Cridland, the CBI's director general, suggested the major employers' and industrialists' group was open to the government committing to a target to decarbonise the UK's power sector by 2030 - a major commitment which would mean, effectively, that no gas, oil or coal plants could be used to generate electricity in less than two decades time unless still untenable technology was developed to capture and store the carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Asked if the CBI would support the target being included in the up-coming Electricity Market Reform bill, Cridland repllied: \"I'm not yet persuaded, but that doesn't mean I'm against it.\" If the CBI was satisfied that including the target would not create \"target fatigue\" and would not delay the bill, \"I'd look at it again\", he added.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-64dc14b6-d64e-4d5c-9471-6703f14f7d1f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348665983427/3b65d812-6578-4b73-88be-0d883e3ce1fa-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Vince Cable listens on as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vince Cable sits as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.

But this was not what his committee had found: \"I think there is an interesting question which will arise at some point, which is what Charles Farr has been telling Theresa May everybody is saying to him. I presented a summary of what a lot of the companies we met were saying, and Theresa May said: 'No, they're all entirely happy with this. They've all seen it, and they're quite comfortable.' I said: 'Well, that's not what they're saying,' and she said, 'Well, they must be lying to you.'</p> <p>\"I've spoken now to probably about 15 different companies, and, you know, maybe they are all lying to me, I don't know, but they're lying on record as well, so \u2026 \"</p> <p>Huppert added that \"foreign powers, all sorts of groups would like to get hold of this\" data, and asked delegates: \"How many people here would be prepared to carry a tag which reported on where you were every five minutes?\" Holding up his phone, he said: \"We do.\"</p> <p>Home Office minister Jeremy Browne suggested Huppert should \"not pre-empt the process\", and admitted his curiosity was \"less naturally aroused than Julian's in this area\".

So here we go - my list of 10 things we've learnt from the Lib Dem conference.</p> <p><strong>1. Nick Clegg is trying to forge the Liberal Democrats into a new party \u2013 but his creation is on electoral life-support and it is not yet clear whether it has a viable future.</strong> The Lib Dems used to be a receptacle for the protest vote, buoyed by the hope that electoral reform would eventually give them 100-plus seats in the Commons, but now the protest vote is going elsewhere and, with PR and Lords reform (backdoor PR) off the agenda for years, Clegg is trying to turn the Lib Dems into a mainstream party that can win by first-past-the-post. As Matthew d'Ancona put it <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/9544637/Cleggmania-is-now-nothing-but-a-distant-memory.html\">in a column recently,</a> he wants \u201cnothing less than to create a third party of government; not an electoral dumping ground for the Undecideds, the Outraged and People Who Still Hate Blair, but a party ready to participate in future coalitions and bring its own distinctive approach to bear on government\u201d. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/9493952/Lib-Dems-face-near-wipeout-in-2015-poll-warns.html\">with the polls as they are, </a>this new entity could face virtual electoral wipeout in 2015.</p> <p><strong>2. The Lib Dems seem more committed to ever to the coalition.</strong> This seems strange, given the fact that the decision to go into coalition has led to their collapse in the polls, but the party seems to have realised that it has past the point of no return. It may not know where its journey will end up, but the bridge back to April 2010 is in cinders. The clearest sign of this came when the party endorsed the coalition's key economic strategy, decisively rejecting a call for a Plan B. Clegg also made the point convincingly <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/speeches_detail.aspx?title=Nick_Clegg%E2%80%99s_rally_speech_at_Liberal_Democrat_Autumn_Conference&amp;pPK=ccad70de-e202-43a8-8778-27555c5e6503\">in his speech to the conference rally on Saturday night.</a> \u201cThis is the first time anyone in modern Britain has experienced a national coalition government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must show them it is a form of government that works well for them. If we don\u2019t we will have lost not only the argument for having Liberal Democrats in power but for having a third party at all.\u201d In other words, the Lib Dems face an existential threat, and if the coalition fails, the Lib Dems are doomed too.</p> <p><strong>3. The Lib Dems are seeking to reassert their identity \u2013 and the mansion tax, civil liberties and green growth at the heart of it</strong>. Although events have run relatively smoothly on the conference floor, the realisation that the Lib Dems will have to fight an election as a party of government for the first time has triggered an intense debate about the party's identity that has overshadowed events on the fringe. The most provocative contribution came from Richard Reeves, Clegg's former director of strategy, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/09/case-truly-liberal-party\">whose appeal for undiluted liberalism</a> was seen as an attempt to push the party to the right, but many Lib Dems strongly disagree (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">8.46am)</a> and think the party would be mad to give up on leftish voters who are attracted by the party's social democratic instincts. The Lib Dems have not resolved the right/left argument, but this week has shown members can unite around three themes: taxing the wealthy (the mansion tax has been championed ad nauseam), defending civil liberties (the leadership got trounced on secret courts, in the best debate on the conference) and green growth (which has become a key dividing line with the Tories).</p> <p><strong>4. Clegg intends to fight the next election.</strong> Clegg has always said he intends to fight the next election, but now, for the first time, people like me are starting to believe that he really means it. Partly that's because of his decision to issue his apology, which would not make much sense if he was planning to abandon ship in 2014. And partly because it's because people who know him well seem to be increasingly certain that he is going to stay on. Sometimes it's the gossip that is particularly persuasive. In the past there were suggestions that his wife Miriam wanted Clegg to stand down before 2015, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/22/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-2012#block-505db576c0e38ada80016272\">at the weekend the Financial Times reported that she's opposed to Clegg taking a job in Brussels,</a> because she has decided that the city is too provincial.</p> <p><strong>5. There will be no imminent leadership challenge.</strong> Clegg's personal ratings are dire, but there has been no serious challenge to his leadership <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">(Lembit Opik doesn't count)</a> and for the moment his position is perfectly safe. But it might be different in 2013, and as for 2014 \u2013 book your tickets for the conference now. If Clegg has not already suffered an attempt to depose him by then, 2014 should be the moment for a showdown.</p> <p><strong>6. Vince Cable is the party's undisputed leader-in-waiting.</strong> Cable has not done anything disloyal in Brighton, but he used his speech on Monday to advertise his availability, and his credentials as someone who could work with Labour or the Tories, and, with a clutch of polls showing that the party would do better under his leadership, he is now, for the moment, the overwhelming favourite to succeed Clegg. Tim Farron's prospects seem dimmer than they did last year and Chris Huhne \u2013 whose absence leaves Lib Dem firepower much weaker than it was \u2013 is of course, er, otherwise engaged.</p> <p><strong>7. Election manifestos are going to look different in the future because they will clearly differentiate between non-negotiable promises and negotiable ones.</strong> The Lib Dem tuition fee experience, and Clegg's apology, has focused attention on how the party can avoid this problem in the future. \u201cAll parties will need to be more upfront with the British people on what 'tablet of stone' stuff, and the other [promises] that will depend on circumstances,\u201d Clegg said yesterday.</p> <p><strong>8. Coalition government is making government more open.</strong> In the past ministers used to row in private and defend their collective decisions in public. When the coalition launched the two parties tried to play down their differences in public, but now Clegg and his colleagues are so open about their differences with their Tory colleagues that, as this week has demonstrated, it has almost stopped being a story. Danny Alexander proposed a motion implicitly attacking his boss, George Osborne, and the media barely batted an eyelid. Conversations that used to take place behind closed doors are now being conducted in public. It's a notable shift in Whitehall culture.</p> <p><strong>9. The Lib Dems are still overwhelmingly white and male.</strong> The party has no ethnic minority MPs and there seem to be very few ethnic minority delegates at the conference. We have not had a speech from a high-profile Lib Dem woman, although Jo Swinson <a href=\"http://markreckons.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/jo-swinson-could-be-our-next-leader.html\">(who is being tipped as a future leader) </a>may fill the gap when she speaks. In diversity terms, this party has a very long way to go.</p> <p><strong>10. But it's a great party to join if you want to speak at a party conference.</strong> This week has confirmed that the Lib Dems are still the only main party in British politics who are genuinely comfortable about letting their members debate politics.

It's copy from the Press Association.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A packed hall at the party's conference in Brighton voted almost unanimously to oppose the government's proposals, which include letting home owners build extensions of up to 25ft in their gardens. <br>Local government minister Don Foster was left with the humiliation of being the only speaker to oppose the motion, while only three Lib Dem members voted in favour of the government's plans.</p> <p>Lib Dem councillors lined up one after the other to criticise the plans and the party's leadership for adopting what Foster insisted was a Tory idea which had made it into the coalition agreement. <br>One councillor asked what planet deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and his fellow Lib Dem MPs were on. <br>The emergency motion exposed tensions between the party's MPs and members, who expressed their anger at having another Tory policy foisted upon them. <br>Catharine Smart, from Cambridge, said: \"This proposal will not help growth, it will not speed up construction. It will actually slow it down. You just wonder what planet some of these people are on. <br>\"Just for once these parliamentarians should listen to the little people on the district councils who actually know most about this. Just listen to them and take these stupid ideas away.\" <br>Richard Fagence, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: \"This is not just a mistake, in my opinion. This is a huge mistake. <br>\"Don't even get me started on extensions. <br>\"My back garden is wider than it is deep, if you see what I mean. It's about 32ft deep but you could now develop an extension 26ft deep in old money. <br>\"The motion calls on the coalition government to withdraw these proposals. I would add one word to that: immediately.\" <br>Prue Bray, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said: \"This is not the first coalition policy forced on the party. <br>\"We know in coalition we cannot have everything we want. We understand the need for confidentiality in government. <br>\"But surely it is not beyond us as a party to come up with a better way for the party and parliamentarians to work together so we can avoid situations like this?\" <br>Tim Ward, from Cambridge, said the plans were \"both unnecessary and damaging\". <br>\"Every time one of these daft ideas arrives from government, I have to direct one of my senior officer to researching, analysing and responding to the consultation,\" he said. <br>\"I have an officer working on this as we speak. I would much rather have my officers concentrating on growth.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062d367c0e327c3f7c905d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T10:05:27.337Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's my colleague John Harris's take on the Lib Dem conference.

His next task, which begins today, is to prepare his party for the least worst fate that may be available: a coalition with Labour.

As a check on Labour\u2019s tendency to illiberalism in any future coalition, they could become both popular and indispensable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062ba1cc0e327c3f7c905c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T08:17:33.892Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I enjoy party conferences and there have been some good moments this week in Brighton (as well as quite a few dull ones), but I've had a nagging sense ever since I arrived that these events don't really matter quite so much as they used to. I thought it was because party conferences are increasingly dominated by lobbyists, rather than activists, but <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/danielfinkelstein/article3549498.ece\">in the Times today (paywall) Daniel Finkelstein suggests that there's a wider problem, which relates to the way politics is changing.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once these events in seaside towns were the gathering places of the representatives of vast movements. Parties had millions of members and were among the biggest voluntary associations in the country. When addressing the party faithful, a leader was addressing a real group, a significant group.</p> <p>But now? The mass party movements are no more. The membership has disappeared. And yet everyone keeps going as if it hasn\u2019t happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finkelstein suggests that annual conferences should be abandoned. Much as I like coming, I think he's onto something.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not assailing party members. It is fashionable to say they are swivel-eyed or doddery. Me, I\u2019ve always liked them. There\u2019s no part of their strange political obsession that I don\u2019t partake of fully myself. I\u2019ve had a lot to do with Tory party members and overwhelmingly found them kind, intelligent, engaged and committed to their communities. Other party memberships are no less so.</p> <p>But their politics are hardly representative. Not even of the core vote, let alone of swing voters. The biggest move in politics is from the committed to the uncommitted, from those with tribal attachments to those simply keeping score, choosing governments as if they were company managers. And the annual party conference season denies this trend, instead gathering together these unrepresentative people, encouraging them to confirm each other in their own beliefs and exerting pressure on governments and political leaderships to respond.</p> <p>The decline of mass political parties is hugely significant and almost certainly irreversible. And it\u2019s time for reform that reflects this reality. It is wrong, for instance, that what amount to little cliques should be choosing candidates for Parliament. But why not start by ending these annual conferences? A broader convention of supporters every three or four years, perhaps. That should be plenty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:46:31.526Z\">8.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has not been much evidence of plotting against Nick Clegg at the Lib Dem conference, but my colleague <strong>Patrick Kingsley</strong> was at the Liberal Left fringe meeting yesterday where he discovered that an attempted coup is underway. It's being masterminded by Lembit Opik! Here's what Patrick sent me.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Half of Liberal Democrats are dissatisfied with Nick Clegg, according to an activists' poll, but it's been hard to find barefaced dissent at conference. Last night's Liberal&#xa0;Left event was the exception \u2013 former MP Lembit Opik openly demanded that Clegg resign as leader, soliciting support for a petition that calls for Clegg to remain as&#xa0;deputy prime minister, but step away from the running of the party.</p> <p>\"The problem is that the image of the Liberal Democrats is mixed up with the coalition government,\" said Opik. Clegg is too tainted by his relationship with the Tories, he&#xa0;said: if he's not ousted by the next election, \"we'll be throttled to death.\"</p> <p>Currently, the Lib Dem conference cannot fire the Lib Dem leader. But should Opik's petition gather enough support, it would force a vote at the party's spring&#xa0;conference on whether to give delegates the power to sack Clegg. The proposal would need a two-thirds majority to pass.</p> <p>Opik wants Clegg to get on with the business of running the country, and let someone else try to remould the party's image. That someone, he argued, would ideally be&#xa0;a leftish backbencher who comes from the grass-roots. He wouldn't name names \u2013 but party president Tim Farron fits the bill.&#xa0;</p> <p>Opik was speaking at a fringe event hosted by Liberal Left, the party's most left-wing faction \u2013 and led by rebel MP Adrian Sanders, assembly member Stephen Knight,&#xa0;and Liberal Left chair Linda Jack.</p> <p>\"Where next for the Liberal Democrats?\" the panellists asked \u2013 and for many the answer was clear: away from Clegg.</p> <p>\"When your party leader starts to appear on your opponents' leaflets more often than your own,\" said Knight, \"you have to wonder whether or not he's an asset.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>More generally, there were concerns that the Lib Dems have swung too far to the right in recent years. \"There is a feeling that this is no longer our party,\" said Linda&#xa0;Jack, who tabled an amendment on Monday criticising the coalition's deficit plans, which was shot down by party honchos. A decade ago, she argued, social liberals&#xa0;like her were at the centre of the Liberal Democrats. But because so many left-wingers have since left, those who remain are now seen as extremists.</p> <p>Knight was particularly upset at a recent pamphlet on \"Cleggism\" written by Richard Reeves, Clegg's outgoing strategist. Reeves promoted the pamphlet at a think-tank&#xa0;event on Monday \u2013 arguing that the party should abandon their social democratic wing, and redefine themselves as purely big-L Liberal. Sanders said Reeves shouldn't&#xa0;be taken too seriously: his debate was mocked at a meeting of the parliamentary party on Monday. One MP, he said, noted that it was on at the same time as a&#xa0;discussion about assisted dying \u2013 and wondered whether the two events could have been merged.</p> <p>For his part, Sanders stayed clear of saying anything particularly inflammatory. But he suggested that Clegg was stuck in a bubble, and needed to employ more advisers&#xa0;with links to the grassroots.</p> <p>So if this was the revolution, it was a pretty small one. Only 20 people turned up, evidence that not everyone left in the party hankers after rebellion. Sanders said there&#xa0;were no machinations within parliament to depose Clegg, while Opik is a marginal figure, ridiculed for losing one of the Liberal Democrats' safest seats in 2010.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-27T10:03:21.626Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5062b11dc0e327c3f7c905bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:39:19.760Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's the final day of the Lib Dem conference and Nick Clegg will close the conference with a speech at 2.30pm. Some excerpts have already been released in advance, and The Times, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxyQqDik2rs\">remembering David Steel,</a> has summed up Clegg's message with a rather brilliant headline (paywall): <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3549685.ece\">\u201cGo back to your constituencies and prepare for vitriol and abuse.\u201d </a>Here's the quote from the Clegg speech setting it out in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that there are some in the party \u2013 some in this hall even \u2013 who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the Coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from Right and Left, as we work every day to keep this Government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Before Clegg speaks, we've also got a full programme of events this morning. Here's the full agenda.</p> <p><em>9am:</em> Debate on mental health</p> <p><em>9.45am:</em> Emergency debate on planning, on a motion saying the government should drop its plan to relax some planning laws for three years.</p> <p><em>10.35am:</em> Debate on housing.</p> <p><em>12.20pm:</em> Jo Swinson, the new consumer affairs minister, delivers a speech.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Nick Clegg's speech. As Patrick Wintour reports, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-speech\">Clegg will send an austere message to his party on Wednesday, telling them the Liberal Democrats are willing to impose several more years of spending restraint, are now anchored in the centre ground and are determined never to revert to being a party of protest and opposition.</a></p> <p>At some point this morning I'm also going to write a post on 10 things we've learnt from the Lib Dem conference (once I've worked out what they are).</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div>   </div>",

The trainer and his family were unharmed following the blaze at their home at Ballydoyle Stables in County Tipperary on Wednesday night. The cause of the fire is not believed to be suspicious.</p> <p>Emergency services were called to Ballydoyle, where Camelot, the Derby winner, is stabled, shortly after 10pm when a fire was reported in an upstairs bedroom at the O'Brien family home. The roof of the house suffered extensive damage before it could be brought under control.</p> <p>A Garda spokesman said that people were in the house at the time of the fire but all escaped unharmed. A forensic examination will be carried out today to determine its cause.</p> <h2>Thursday's best bets, by Greg Wood</h2> <p>A good afternoon at Newmarket will take John Gosden past Aidan O'Brien in the trainers' championship, and he has a good chance to record a swift double on the Rowley Mile this afternoon thanks to <strong>Hoarding (2.35)</strong> and <strong>Gallipot (3.10)</strong>.</p> <p>There is a big turnout for the latter event, including several four-year-old fillies with solid form at this level. It is the three-year-old Gallipot, though, who looks the most progressive filly in the field, having run well in the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster last time out in her first start outside handicap company. Anything close to a reproduction of that effort would probably be good enough today, while there is every chance after eight starts that there is a little more to come.</p> <p>It is difficult to see beyond <strong>Havana Gold (3.40)</strong> in the feature race, the Group Three Somerville Tattersall Stakes, and he would be attempting to complete an unbeaten five-timer had he not swerved and unseated his jockey in a Listed race at Deauville in August.</p> <p>Godolphin have the first and second favourites in the Jockey Club Rose Bowl, with Cavalryman heading the market and Lost In The Moment \u2013 who was one place in front of him in the Lonsdale Cup at York \u2013 next in the betting. At the prices, though, there is plenty to like about <strong>Chiberta King (4.15)</strong>, who was a good second in this race under a penalty 12 months ago and has possibly been aimed towards it ever since. He has something to find with Cavalryman on their Sandown running in July, but the favourite was a little disappointing last time and will be vulnerable if not at his best.</p> <h2>Tipping competition \u2013 day four</h2> <p>York may be taking a soaking, but City fan Blitzwing is dancing in the rain* after landing a treble with his three selections on Wednesday. Hitting the net at 7-2, 7-2 and 13-8, he surged into the lead but won't get comfortable with plenty of you within a good 12-1 shot of taking over.

  "<p>So Silvio Berlusconi says that Germany is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/us-berlusconi-germany-idUSBRE88O0K020120925\" title=\"\">\"a hegemonial state that \u2026 dictated to the other European countries the rules of rigour and austerity\"</a>. Big surprise. The guy is planning a comeback, and Germany-bashing always goes down well in Italy.</p> <p>Remember when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/02/italy.eu\" title=\"\">Berlusconi assumed the presidency of the EU in 2003</a>? He used his first appearance before the European parliament to attack the German MEP Martin Schulz, saying he would recommend Schulz for the role of a Nazi concentration camp commander in an upcoming second world war film. A week later, Berlusconi's secretary of state for tourism criticised the \"uniform supernationalistic blondes\" \u2013 German tourists \u2013 who \"loudly invade\" Italy's beaches every summer.</p> <p>The background to that round of anti-Teutonic fervour was also internal Italian politics, namely Berlusconi's legal woes.</p> <p>The problem with <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/silvio-berlusconi-mario-monti-lhuffington-post_n_1910534.html\" title=\"\">Berlusconi's latest outburst</a> is that \u2013 and I never thought I'd say this \u2013 he is in part right. Not about Germany's hegemony. We'll get to that. But when he says that it is an illusion to think \"that austerity leads to debt reduction\", Berlusconi has a point, as he does when saying that \"public debt diminishes when GDP increases, which means development and growth\". And he is also right to criticise his successor, Mario Monti, for caving in on labour market reform, which would be key to increasing Italy's competitiveness.</p> <p>But what about this German \"diktat\"? Is Germany dictating austerity policies to other countries? Are national budgets now decided in Berlin? I might have been inclined to agree with Berlusconi before the French presidential election, the European summit of 28 June and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19499950\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi's announcement that the European Central Bank is ready to buy unlimited amounts of eurozone government bonds</a>.</p> <p>At the June summit, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Mario Monti and Spain's Mariano Rajoy faced down Angela Merkel and got her to agree that next to structural budget cuts a big dollop of Keynesian stimulus is needed to get the eurozone moving again. Then came Draghi's \"bazooka\" and Germany's ratification of the European stability mechanism (ESM) with \u20ac700bn-worth of funds, \u20ac190bn courtesy of the German taxpayer.</p> <p>As a result, the management of the debt crisis and the \"economic governance\" of the eurozone are now off the hands of national governments \u2013 including the one in Berlin. They are in the hands of three unelected officials: the bosses of the ECB, the ESM and the European commission. The European parliament has been sidelined. As has the council.</p> <p>Draghi says that in order to qualify for the ECB's debt-buying programme, governments will have to apply for ESM aid and submit to the ESM's conditions. But since the June summit there is reason to suppose that the ESM will not impose very harsh conditions \u2013 why should they? The ECB, after all, is ready and waiting with its bazooka. The eurozone, in short, will try to inflate its way out of the crisis with Anglo-Saxon style \"quantitative easing\". So much for the German \"diktat\".</p> <p>Merkel has got the opposite of what she wanted: the euro is now on the path to becoming a soft currency, as the French always hoped it would be. The Maastricht treaty is dead. Inflation is the new eurobonds. This is how Germany is paying for its vast current account surplus.</p> <p>So, should Germany leave the euro, as <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1e2f2cd0-064e-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F1e2f2cd0-064e-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FMasoN1Op#axzz27V8ZvTQy\" title=\"\">some commentators</a> in Britain and the US and German populists are suggesting? I can't help pointing out that Anglo-Saxon columnists just might be a weeny bit nationally biased, as a return to the deutschmark could price German exports out of the market. One of the nasty secrets about the euro is that the money German taxpayers fork out to keep the currency afloat is an export subsidy for German industry. Yet the idea that Germany leaving the eurozone would somehow benefit the southern Europeans is far-fetched, if not plain loony.</p> <p>The rump euro would devaluate as the deutschmark rose, making not only German goods but almost all imports unaffordable to consumers. Fearing further devaluation, investors would pull out of government bonds, causing governments to default. Germany, on the other hand, would do what it has always done: concentrate on quality that people are willing to pay for, rationalise production, keep wages low and so on. In other words, pursue the mercantilist policy that is part of the current problem, concentrating on northern and eastern Europe, China, and the US rather than the Mediterranean basket cases. After a couple of hard years, Germany would be back, leaner and meaner than before.</p> <p>Quite frankly, the new, soft euro \u2013 precisely because it makes German goods cheaper \u2013 is poison to that fabled German work ethic and innovative spirit. <em>Vorsprung durch</em> an undervalued currency? Not for very long.</p> <p>Historical reasons mean that Germany can't exit the euro, period. The common currency was, after all, the price Helmut Kohl paid to get Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's backing for German unification. Mitterrand thought this would give France some control over the economic giant next door. For a while, it looked as though he had blundered. But now it's Kohl who's got egg on his face. If there's one European instinct you can count on, it's clubbing together to keep the Germans down.</p>",
  "<p>Fourteen years ago Sheffield Wednesday beat Arsenal, the Premier League champions, at Hillsborough with an 89th-minute winner. The match is not remembered for the&#xa0;unlikely&#xa0;result, but for a tumble taken in the last minute of the first half, when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFDzNgOiqbU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=14s\">Paolo Di Canio responded to a red card by pushing over referee Paul Alcock</a>. </p> <h2>The report</h2> <p>Here is how the Trevor Haylett reported the game for the Guardian at the time:</p> <p><strong>Di Canio puts rage in outrageous</strong></p> <p>Amid all the rumours and half-truths emanating from Hillsborough on Saturday afternoon there was no suggestion that the home side's dressing-room door had become detached from its hinges nor any hint that what was once a glass mirror was now a thousand pieces on the floor. Paolo Di Canio finally had his dangerously combustible temper under control.</p> <p>The same could not be said for Patrick Vieira, another player with so much to offer the game but who too is never more than a couple of steps away from the next explosive outburst. At the end of this mad, sad affair the Arsenal midfielder appeared to direct abusive hand-signs at the Wednesday supporters and was alleged to have hit a police officer in the tunnel.</p> <p>Clearly Di Canio has guaranteed himself a long ban with his disgraceful two-handed assault on the referee Paul Alcock, having just been shown the red card for his violent clash with Martin Keown. As part of its investigation the Football Association will also study the evidence against Vieira and he too may be the subject of serious sanction.</p> <p>English football, so willing to embrace Continental flair and charisma, is paying a price for that open-door policy because many of the newcomers too easily fly off the handle. Where Di Canio and Vieira now rampage, so too did Eric Cantona before them.</p> <p>Like the former Manchester United hothead, who received an eight-month ban for his flying kick at a Crystal Palace supporter in 1995, there can be no excuse for Di Canio's outrage no matter the provocation that he alluded to as he made his angry way off the field, cursing and gesturing and brushing aside his own manager's attempt to placate him.</p> <p>Wednesday immediately suspended their star attacker for an indefinite period until the FA has decided what punishment to impose. It is a matter of doubt whether we will see the temperamental Italian in the Premiership again.</p> <p>\"He totally lost it for a split second and I don't know what was going through his head,\" said Danny Wilson. \"We immediately suspended him so that people understand that we recognise the severity of the incident, and we will back the FA in whatever they choose to do.\"</p> <p>After a recent public falling-out with Di Canio, Wilson had made efforts to heal the breach and only 24 hours before this game declared that peace had broken out. He admitted he felt betrayed by what went on but was more concerned at the damage his player had done to the game and the handicap he left his team-mates, who nevertheless went on to inflict Arsenal's first defeat of the season through a last-minute goal.</p> <p>The 44th-minute uproar came after Vieira, hounded by Wim Jonk outside the Arsenal penalty area, reacted tetchily to the Dutchman tugging on his shirt and bowled him over. Players descended on the scene from all corners and Di Canio and Keown began grappling like schoolchildren in the playground. The Italian was the first to be shown the red card and reacted by pushing the Kent official to the ground.</p> <p>It could be argued that Keown was unlucky to go too, that he was merely acting as peacemaker. Yet fending off his opposite number with a raised forearm while holding on to the neck of his shirt cannot further the cause of peace and Alcock was right to show him the red card as well.</p> <p>It was a great shame that the unseemly episode completely overshadowed a contest which in the second half, with more space in which to play, became a wonderfully free-flowing contest with goalscoring chances at both ends.</p> <p>The goalkeepers were magnificent, Kevin Pressman blocking Ray Parlour's early surge, extending a leg to deny Dennis Bergkamp and then plunging to his right to divert Nicolas Anelka's low shot, and Alex Manninger making an acrobatic stop from Emerson Thome, who thought he had headed Wednesday in front.</p> <p>Wednesday's substitute Lee Briscoe then missed from a far simpler opening but was spared any lasting embarrassment when in the 90th minute he delicately flighted a dipper beyond David Seaman's stand-in. It was a goal which deserved to monopolise the post-match discussion but it became incidental to football's latest controversy.</p> <p>See footage of the incident here:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vFDzNgOiqbU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vFDzNgOiqbU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>The reaction</h2> <p>Di Canio claimed later that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/1998/sep/30/newsstory.sport6\">Alcock dived</a>: \"He took three or four sideways steps before falling over in rather a strange way, like someone diving to win a penalty.\" Unfortunately for Di Canio, the FA disagreed. The association took the advice of sports minister Tony Banks, who said they should \"chuck the book\" at Di Canio. He was banned for 11 matches and fined \u00a310,000. </p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/sep/17/newsstory.sport5\">interviewed by Amy Lawrence for the Observer in 2000</a>, Di Canio maintained his suspicion of referees:</p> <blockquote> <p>No topic inspires him quite like the old chestnut of referees. He's convinced they don't like him. He can't help implying that they come from the George Orwell school of all players being equal but some more equal than others. To illustrate the point he ends up dramatising a scene where he is shot in the back by a defender with a gun. 'Is that a penalty, ref?' he gasps, his dying words, before roaring with laughter at the twist when the referee books him for diving as he is carted off to the mortuary.</p> <p>'I argue with referees a lot. I do this when I don't see a fair attitude from them. Sometimes I would like to say something in a more gentle way but you have snap decisions. It's difficult to say something like an Oxford student [he pops a plum in his mouth] \"I'm sorry, why didn't you give me a penalty?\" I'm jealous of players who can say it calmly but I can't do that.'</p> </blockquote> <h2>The present</h2> <p>Di Canio retains his ability to dominate his team's match reports. When Swindon lost at Leyton Orient earlier this month, the Italian made top billing, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/08/swindon-leyton-orient-paolo-di-canio\">prompting Paul Doyle to begin his report with a worrying thought</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>For a while Paolo Di Canio seemed in danger of finishing this match naked. The more frustrated the Italian grew at his team's dishevelled display, the more clothes he discarded. Midway through the first half he hurled his coat into the dugout, early in the second he jettisoned his suit jacket, so when Lee Cook scored what turned out to be the winning goal for Leyton Orient in the 59th minute, the pitchside photographers who track Di Canio's every strop began to look forward to a bumper payday </p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Share your memories of the incident in the comments section</strong></h2>",
  "<p>Dave Hartnett is a tax expert. Without tax expertise the state can't collect revenue. Without revenue, public services founder. Without public services society falls apart. That syllogism needs to be borne in mind by the former permanent secretary's critics.</p> <p>If Hartnett is to carry <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9330102/HMRC-cleared-of-sweetheart-tax-deals-for-business.html\" title=\"\">personal responsibility </a>for failing to collect revenue owed by Vodafone and Goldman Sachs, he must also be accorded a personal role, over many years, in securing the flow of billions into the Inland Revenue and HM Revenue &amp; Customs \u2013 a point made by Lord O'Donnell when <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpubacc/c1531-ii/c153101.htm\" title=\"\">they both appeared in front of the Commons public accounts committee </a>last November. (And if we're in the wider blame game, O'Donnell's role in the unhappy merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs &amp; Excise bears scrutiny.)</p> <p>But should it be a 'blame game'? On 20 September a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9562696/Former-HMRC-head-Dave-Hartnett-awarded-by-protesters.html\" title=\"\">student group posing as employees of GoldmanSachs and Vodafone, interrupted a dinner in Hartnett's honour</a>. As protests go, it was stylish, even elegant. But its rationale was that a civil servant is personally culpable, despite the multiple investigations of his conduct by the PAC and the National Audit Office, let alone the political accountability for HMRC work borne by Treasury ministers and, ultimately the chancellor and the prime minister.</p> <p>What Hartnett did, or did not do, was contained within a system of governance. That system, the PAC found, was inadequate but that does not translate into personal culpability for an official who dedicated his career to the fair and effective administration of tax law and who during it won many friends and admirers for his energy, determination and (counter cultural in Whitehall) willingness to explain and justify his actions in public hearing.</p> <p>Tax officials need to spend time with recalcitrant tax payers and other sinners \u2013 and have done so <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9&amp;version=NIV\" title=\"\">since biblical times</a>. That puts them in the firing line, in a much more direct way than other civil servants. For that they deserve credit, even if it means building around them checks, balances and scrutiny.</p> <p>Tax officials need to fend off the silky attack of highly-paid QCs retained by recalcitrant tax payers. That means they need to be super able and highly adaptable \u2013 qualities Hartnett possesses in abundance. His premature exit from HMRC without the knighthood he in other circumstances would surely have deserved robbed the senior corridors of a warrior. At the Liberal Democrat conference this week Danny Alexander talks of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19691546\" title=\"\">beefing up the 'affluence unit'</a> \u2013 but training and experience take time, and what Hartnett also brought was a career-deep expertise.</p> <p>All that needs to be weighed in the balance against his judgment in the high-profile corporate cases that are the subject of the protests. Critics to the left especially need to exercise caution. Attacking senior officials can undermine the state's capacity to do what is absolutely necessary if it is to be active and generous, which is raise money \u2013 and reduce the 'tax gap'.</p> <p>There's a broader point. It's coincidence that the invasion of the Hartnett dinner took place within days of the Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell insulting the police officers guarding Downing Street \u2013 let's not quibble about his actual words.</p> <p>To be effective many public servants have to be recognised as possessing legitimate authority: teachers have pedagogical skill; nurses are trained to organise their patients' care; police officers secure society by using powers to order our behaviour, and so on. Left and right can come together (in theory). Disagreeing about how big government should be, they concur that government must have authority. One side might emphasise the authority needed to levy taxes; the other might stress the need for hierarchy to be maintained.</p> <p>Mitchell, a Tory, showed disrespect towards the bearers of public authority. Perhaps he has been caught up in the zeitgeisty sentiment distrustful of public institutions. Perhaps his zeal to deconstruct the state spilled over into despising its officials \u2013 his Toryism, following the lead given by Oliver Letwin and other ministers, actively wants to pull down the apparatus of government and its method is to express contempt for what government does. If that sounds like anarchy, perhaps it is.</p> <p><em>David Walker is contributing editor to the Public Leaders Network</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Watch here</a></p> <p>Tears for Fears brought the 80s to a close with a song that owed much to the 60s. Roland Orzabal borrowed the title for 1989's brilliant <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-seeds-of-love-mw0000205746\">The Seeds of Love</a> album from a traditional English folk song, but there is nothing folksy about this track: everything about it is big \u2013 the aspirations, the sound, the egos. Fittingly it was a big hit, although with production values that made Taylor and Burton's Cleopatra look like The Blair Witch Project, there was a huge outlay to recoup. </p> <p>There's a lot going on in this superbly arranged and produced recording, including a great vocal performance by Orzabal and fine solos on trumpet (Jon Hassell) and Hammond organ (Ian Stanley). I love the random shouts, screams and whoops in the background (and the moment at around 2:43 when an opera singer apparently strays absent-mindedly into the wrong studio).</p> <p>The element of Beatles pastiche has been much discussed and Sowing the Seeds of Love does sound like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG73Pk1yUj8\">I Am the Walrus</a> at the start, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIV7jwLXt8\">Penny Lane</a> in the middle and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4p8qxGbpOk\">All You Need Is Love</a> at the end. However, for me it's the Lennonesque lyrics that most evoke the Fab Four, particularly the lines:</p> <p>\"Feel the pain, talk about it/ If you're a worried man then shout about it/ Open hearts, feel about it/ Open minds, think about it/ Everyone read about it/ everyone scream about it.\"</p> <p>There are also various references, intentional or not, to other songs and works of art, including the character <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkYBJId7WZs\">LSD's performance of Love Power</a> in Mel Brooks's movie The Producers (\"If everybody in the world today had a flower instead of a gun, there would be no wars!\").</p> <p>It's all preposterous, the Death by Chocolate of pop, and for that reason may not be everybody's cup of sauternes, but they get away with it because beneath all the razzmatazz lies a well-constructed song, particularly the chorus and the lovely counterpoint between Orzabal's lead vocal and Curt Smith's \"time to eat all your words\" lines.</p> <p>Orzabal and Smith, who split soon after The Seeds of Love, have enjoyed a successful reunion in recent years and it's encouraging to see they have not lost their taste for everything-including-the-kitchen-sink grandiosity: with orchestra, choir, backing singers and musicians, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lx7uguvFzM\">this 2006 performance</a> of the song in Belgium suggests they had Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand in mind, only with a bigger drum kit. Completely over the top, and completely marvellous.</p>",

  "<p>After all the hype surrounding Sarah Taylor before the tournament, it was the lower-profile opener Laura Marsh who assured England of a winning start in what was expected to be the easiest of their three group matches.</p> <p>Marsh, the 25-year-old from Pembury in Kent, made 54 from 41 balls including seven fours and two cleanly struck sixes in an opening stand of 102 before she was left stranded by a straight drive from her captain Charlotte Edwards that was deflected on to the stumps.</p> <p>England lost their way badly after that, scrambling 31 for six from the last seven overs of their innings, and playing subcontinental spin so badly they might have been taking lessons from the men's team. But a couple of cracking catches, by Jenny Gunn and Arran Brindle, dismissed the dangerous-looking Pakistan openers to remove any outside chance of defeat, and England's spinners did the rest.</p> <p>Marsh completed an excellent all-round performance that earned her the player of the match award by having Bismah Maroof efficiently stumped by Taylor, and ended with one for 14 from her four overs. Danielle Hazell, another off-spinner, chipped in with two for 19, and Holly Colvin mopped up with her left-arm spin to earn career-best figures of four for nine.</p> <p>England's fourth spinner, Danielle Wyatt, hobbled off midway through her third over but Edwards reported no serious damage. \"Just a big girl's blouse,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We were looking for 150 plus,\" the captain admitted. \"But we'll learn a lot from that. It's hard for new batters to come in on a slow pitch against slow bowlers. We'd identified before the game that the first six overs were crucial, and thankfully me and especially Laura got us off to a good start.\"</p> <p>Marsh came into the tournament in good touch after playing a couple of eyecatching innings during the one-day series against West Indies at the end of the summer, and also crunched some no-nonsense boundaries in England's warm-up match against South Africa in Colombo.</p> <p>It is the power of her hitting that especially impresses, without any hint of a slog, and she confirmed afterwards that is partly down to the weight-training that is part of the England performance programme \u2013 as well as a good bat.</p> <p>\"That's why we decided to open the batting with her 18 months ago,\" Edwards explained. \"I think we complement each other.\"</p> <p>England now need to win one of their remaining two group matches, against India on Saturday and Australia on Monday, to reach the semi finals in Colombo. Australia and India faced each other in the second match of Thursday's double-header in pleasant sunshine at the lovely Galle ground, overlooked by the Dutch fort with the Indian Ocean in the background.</p> <p>But Pakistan's performance must also have encouraged the watching bigwigs. Their captain, Sana Mir, bowled beautifully, and Qanita Jalil, a 32-year-old from Abbottabad, struck two boundaries off Anya Shrubsole's opening over, before Brindle prevented her from doing any further damage with a sharp low catch at midwicket.</p>",
  "<p>\"How do we fix this mess?\" That may be one of the stupidest questions I have ever asked myself, as of course I don't know the answer. What I do know, however, is that few of the structural flaws in how the global economy operates, which took us from unsustainable boom to intractable bust, have been fixed. And that leads me to fear that in the rich west, and perhaps more widely, it will be many years yet before we enjoy the kind of recovery that raises most people's living standards.</p> <p>Here are just a few of the surreal characteristics of the worldwide financial and economic system that is our lot.</p> <p>We have global regulations for banks that incentivise them to make it impossible for ordinary mortals \u2013 including their owners, regulators and even their own directors \u2013 to know with confidence the risks they are running. And at the same time these rules encourage senior bank executives to run their respective operations in a way that maximises the short-term profits they make \u2013 and of course their pay and bonuses \u2013 subject to those regulations, rather than simply concentrating on providing the credit and services of most use to their customers.</p> <p>I am referring to the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords\" title=\"\">Basel</a> rules, set by a largely unaccountable priesthood of regulators and central bankers who meet in camera in a sleepy Swiss town and have determined how banks protect themselves against shocks since the 1980s. Think of these money priests as the financial equivalents of the members of Fifa's governing body or the International Olympic Committee \u2013 which is not to suggest that there has ever been a hint of corruption at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Committee_on_Banking_Supervision\" title=\"\">Basel committee on banking supervision</a>, but is to say that transparency and openness are not the strongest suits of a committee whose recommendations have a powerful bearing on all our livelihoods.</p> <p>The Basel rules were originally designed to ensure that all big banks anywhere in the world retained a minimum amount of capital relative to their loans and investments, to absorb losses when it all goes wrong. In other words, they were supposed to make the banking system safer and to create a level playing field between banks. In practice, and almost from the start, the rules were written in such a complicated way that they created a virtual licence for clever bankers and their respective banks to cheat. And the devastating consequence is that they actually allowed banks to become both dangerously enormous and to hold less capital relative to their loans than at any point in history, although you could not see how weak banks had become because of the eccentric way that the rules calculate capital and risk.</p> <p>Here is what should perhaps worry us all. Although banks are being forced to hold more capital (a good thing), the Basel rules have become even more complicated, creating even greater incentives for banks to cheat. So for me, one of the great mysteries of the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/credit-crunch-boom-bust-timeline\" title=\"\">2008 financial crisis</a>, which was a big cause of our current malaise, is why the Basel rulebook was not torn up and replaced with something a lot simpler. Arguably, it would have been much more sensible to give banks more freedom to manage their operations in a commercial way, subject to simpler stipulations that would place stricter limits on how much banks can lend relative to their capital, and how much cash they have to hold as protection against runs.</p> <p>To return to the analogy with sport, we all know that the simpler and clearer are the rules of any game, the easier it is to prevent cheating. Unfortunately, this is not a lesson that the global financial priesthood seems keen to learn.</p> <p>So what else about the wonky way the world generates wealth is still in need of reform? Well it might be an idea for there to be a less sharp distinction between the consuming and borrowing countries on the one hand \u2013 that's the UK, the US and the shakier parts of the eurozone \u2013 and the producing and lending countries, such as China and Germany. To put it in slightly simplistic and emotive terms, it is surely barking mad that Chinese workers toil every hour of the day to make stuff for us, which we buy with credit that to an extent China has provided to us.</p> <p>The way I see the crash of 2008 is the moment when the penny dropped that a number of economies \u2013 and the UK was in the frontline of these \u2013 had borrowed more than they could afford to repay. I am talking here about aggregated debt, or the sum of what consumers, companies, banks and government owe. Since that painful awakening, we have not started to pay down the debt in any meaningful way. Instead we have shuffled it, so that government debt has increased as a direct consequence of largeish repayments by banks and modest repayments by consumers. But until the sum of all that debt starts to fall, economies such as ours and America's and much of the eurozone will continue to be on fragile foundations.</p> <p>Which brings me to an elephant that has been in the room in which prime ministers and business leaders swank and swagger for 20 years \u2013 namely that globalisation is real and (ahem) global, but government is national. Or to put it another way, the flaws in globalisation cannot and will not be tackled effectively unless and until there are much better mechanisms for politicians and people to hold in check global capital and global businesses. But if even a region with a large degree of shared history, such as the eurozone, is struggling to centralise political decision-making, it may be naive to hope that the US and Chinese presidents will one day come to think of themselves as playing for the same team, in collective efforts to limit the tendency of globalisation to lurch from crisis to crisis.</p> <p>Or to put it another way, the most I hope to achieve with my new book, \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Fix-This-Mess-Prosperity/dp/1444757091\" title=\"\">How Do We Fix This Mess</a>\", is that a brighter light is shone on what has gone wrong with global finance and the global economy, in the hope that \u2013 at perhaps a snail's pace \u2013 we may one day mend some of it.</p>",

Thus the TV series can afford to cut most of the Prideaux school scenes, retain the Guillam/Smiley relationship, and \"break the rules\" by showing Ann Smiley, all for dramatic effect; first class acting replaces narrative in expressing betrayal and loss, so there needs to be more concentration on the actors themselves. The film, unable to draw on the mini-series' time resources for plot exposition, is compressed almost to abstraction but makes brilliant use of shot selection and mis- en-scene to convey the same themes.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In fact, Nilpferd didn't miss the novel/film/TV series blog. This is it. And s/he's got it off to an excellent start. That's an entirely reasonable and well-balanced position to take on the subject \u2013 which makes it all the more fun to disagree. I didn't dislike <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aco15ScXCwA\" title=\"\">the film</a>, but it seemed the weakest of the three to me. All those carefully rendered 70s browns were too studied, the silences too significant. It wasn't a bad film. It just wasn't quite good enough. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18183704\" title=\"\">As TimHannigan wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It was, I'd say, the perfect failure: immaculately filmed; stylistically impeccable, flawlessly acted by everyone involved, but just a little bit crap nonetheless. It is, after all, a book far too complex to cram successfully into a feature film format, and what the hell was Ricki Tarr doing in Istanbul instead of Hong Kong? And an Istanbul imbued with exactly the same grubby post-industrial atmosphere as London at that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I found myself agreeing with TimHannigan about Istanbul \u2013 and finding his \"grubby\" explanation convincing. But I think my real reaction was more of a knee-jerk. I was just irritated that they did it differently \u2013 which isn't a valid criticism at all, I know. And that leads me to wonder that no matter how I try to rationalise it, my real objection to the film is that it is neither the book, nor <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h1XZ0LzVg4\" title=\"\">the TV series</a>.</p> <p>Are they so good that they poison the well for anything following afterwards? I've conducted an entirely unscientific survey of my friends who have only seen the film and who have seen the film and read the book and/or seen the TV series, which suggests that those who have seen the film alone have enjoyed it much more. I'd be interested to hear if that's a general rule.</p> <p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/17/reading-group-tinker-tailor-le-carre?commentpage=last#end-of-comments\" title=\"\">while we've already expounded on the qualities of the book on the last thread</a>, where the word 'masterpiece' was frequently used without contradiction, little has been said about the TV series so far. So let me lay it on the line here: it's better than The Sopranos and can hold its own against Deadwood and Twin Peaks. It's just about the ultimate DVD box set.</p> <p>I was talking about it to a friend recently who had only seen a small part of one episode, and said that all he could remember was Alec Guinness looking grumpy in a horrible cardigan. And that sums up its peculiar brilliance better than anything else. It's slow, it's grimy \u2013 and it has a great deal of Guinness doing very little. Where the film's 70s mirk seems contrived, on the TV series the muted colours and awful clothes give it a documentary realness. It was made in the year things got so bad people began to think Thatcher was a good idea \u2013 and the directors don't shy away from the awful truth, nor from the frightening furniture. This\u2013 contrary to the film \u2013 isn't all brown. Often it's at its worst in white leather \u2026 but let's not digress into period details. It's the slow-building tension and intrigue that matters. The TV series is a masterclass in pacing and gradual, teasing delivery.</p> <p>And talking of masterclasses, back to Guinness. He never raises his voice \u2013 and barely even raises an eyebrow. He looks like a lovely old teddy bear and says and does little to show that he isn't a kind and gentle soul. Except \u2026 except somehow, he bristles with menace. In spite of his manners, and charm and the fact that he is apparently on our side, he is terrifying. And Guinness portrays all that with little more than a few small eye-motions behind those heavy plastic glasses. As far as I'm concerned it's one of the finest performances in TV history \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18320891\" title=\"\">although Reading Group contributor deadgod provides an eloquent counter-argument</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The key to Smiley is not that he has a tremendous inner life, concomitant with the actions of a great person; the key is that this greatness of character is invisible \u2013 and unsuspected by those with incommensurate, routinised, or blindingly competitive antennae.</p> <p>Smiley is the kind of guy who could quiz you \u2013 in a bar, say \u2013 and afterwards, you'd not remember much distinct about his interest or even appearance, but rather, mostly you'd remember your own \u2013 perfectly innocuous! \u2013 impressions of _____.</p> <p>The thing about Guinness's performance \u2013 again, for me\u2013 is that his Smiley is obviously a soulful person, and a competent person, and that sensation is just not the seeming cipher who triumphs \u2013 terrifically ambiguously \u2013 in the books.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And now we're into the meat of this blog. Who is George Smiley? Is he just a functionary, a cipher? A man whose primary characteristic is that he is entirely self-effacing? Or is he, underneath that plump exterior, a man of steel?</p> <p>For me, the key to his character comes in the novel, in his recollection of a conversation with his wife Ann on the Cornish cliffs, where she asks: is Bill \"a better performer than you?\"</p> <p>\"You've always told me that men aren't to be compared,\" Smiley replies initially. \"'You've always said, you didn't think in that category of comparison.\"</p> <p>When Ann urges, he says: \"All right: no, he's not better.\" And then when she asks if he's \"as good\", Smiley says simply, confidently: \"No.\"</p> <p>He is a man of unusual ability \u2013 and he knows it. That blunt, straight answer contains volumes \u2026 Except \u2013 and here's the catch \u2013 Le Carr\u00e9 tells us a few lines later that this ultimate spy was \"disturbed by this intrusion on his memory.\" He is shaken by thinking about Ann, and shaken by thinking about Bill, and takes a long while to regain his equilibrium. He does have a weakness, and a soul, after all. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18313802\" title=\"\">As Adrian Salmon put it</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What defines Smiley against Karla, and Jim Prideaux against Bill Haydon, are their ability to love and be wounded by it. Smiley gives his loyalty time and again to people and things not worthy of it \u2013 to Ann, who serially betrays him; to Control, who is too obsessed to trust him; and to his country, which fails to reward himthroughout the trilogy. But for Smiley this is a point of pride: 'I behaved like a soft fool. The very archetype of a flabby western liberal. But I would rather be my kind of fool than his for all that.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So is Smiley actually a blunderer who gets lucky? Or is his human warmth the reason for his success \u2013 and the reason to fear him? The joy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9780340993767/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy\" title=\"\">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</a> in novel form and in the TV series is that all interpretations are possible. But I'd be surprised if anyone were led to the same ruminations by the film, where, for all Gary Oldman's talent, the character seemed more straightforward, righteous and angry. It just doesn't have the same depth.</p>",
  "<p>What does the Higgs boson look like? It's a stupid question and I'm not going to answer it but bear with me. The evidence presented for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\">the discovery</a>&#xa0;earlier this summer was \u2014 to my untrained eye \u2014 a hump on a curve that had reached the magic threshold of five sigma significance. Everybody clapped and cheered; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/06/prof-higgs-nice-right-boson?intcmp=239\">Peter Higgs</a> wiped a gratified tear from his eye. Nobody now seriously doubts the existence of the Higgs boson (or at least something very like it \u2013 there are a few details to clear up).</p> <p>And yet no-one has seen it. We have been won over by the mathematical theory and CERN's experimental observations, all of them indirect. It might no longer seem surprising to have such confidence in an entity that cannot be visualised but it was not always thus. The humble atom must be looking on in envy because it did not have such an easy ride into the warm embrace of the scientific community.</p> <p>What the history of the atom shows is that although a sturdy mathematical base could provide some support for a new idea or theory, accompanying visuals were often needed to&#xa0;<em>convince.</em>&#xa0;Until relatively recently, like the apostle Thomas, scientists would not believe unless they had seen. Some still don't.</p> <p>It's a funny old business. I love science's ability to slice through the surface of the world, which our daily immersion dulls with over-familiarity, to reveal just how strange it is underneath. But science is a struggle sometimes, even for scientists, whose&#xa0;stock-in-trade is supposed to be imaginative hypotheses and penetrating insight.&#xa0;</p> <p>Though an ancient idea, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#History\">atom</a> battled resistance for a long time. First discussed by Indian and Greek thinkers over 2000 years ago \u2014 it was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus\">Democritus</a> who coined the term&#xa0;<em>atoms&#xa0;</em>(uncuttable) for this building block of matter \u2014 the atom was ushered into the modern era in the early 19th Century&#xa0;by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton\">John Dalton</a>, chemist and obsessive meteorologist. Drawing on Greek thought and the writings of Newton, Dalton asked why air in the atmosphere, then known to be a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour, remained perfectly mixed at all altitudes rather than settling into layers of different density, like oil and water. In his mind's eye he saw atoms of these different gases as tiny particles whizzing around, their constant motion keeping the air well mixed. This suggestion was received coldly by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy\">Humphrey Davy</a>, perhaps the most celebrated chemist in Britain at the time. He did not share Dalton's vision and was \"astonished how a man of sense or science would be taken up with such a tissue of absurdities\".</p> <p>Dalton persisted. One of his other key contributions was to consider that atoms of any one chemical element were identical to one another and distinguishable from the atoms of all other elements. This idea seemed to show a way to explain the results that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Gay-Lussac\">Gay-Lussac</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Louis_Berthollet\">Berthollet</a>&#xa0;had been getting by reacting pure gases. These French chemists found that reactions involved simple integer ratios of volumes. So two volumes of hydrogen reacted with one of oxygen to produce two volumes of water vapour; and three of hydrogen reacted with one of nitrogen to yield two volumes of pungent ammonia. &#xa0;</p> <p>Why were the numbers so simple? It wasn't clear at first because&#xa0;Dalton made one crucial oversight.&#xa0;He thought that the simplest form of every element that occurred naturally was the single atom but this is not true for common gasses like hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, which contain &#xa0;molecules made from two atoms. As a result, Dalton thought of water vapour as HO, not H2O, and he stuck stubbornly to his guns. No great experimentalist himself, he doubted Gay-Lussac's talents in the laboratory and wrote sniffily: \"The truth is that gases do not unite in equal or exact measures in any one instance; when they appear to do so, it is owing to the inaccuracy of our experiments.\"</p> <p>The matter remained unresolved, although <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amedeo_Avogadro\">Amedeo Avogadro</a> had offered the solution as early as 1811 with the bold (and correct) hypotheses that equal volumes of gases contain equal number of molecules and that some elemental gases were molecular rather than atomic in their simplest form. These insights link the simple volume ratios of reacting gases to our modern understanding of how molecules combine but unfortunately, on publication, Avogadro's idea were widely ignored.</p> <p>It did not help that many chemists used the terms atom and molecule interchangeably, stirring the confusion for decades to come. It seems hard to credit now but as late as 1860 a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Congress\">grand conference of chemists</a> met at Karlsruhe in Germany to ponder the question, \"Would it be judicious to establish a difference between the terms atom and molecule?\"</p> <p>The conference ended without the matter having been settled so in 1868&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_William_Eliot\">Charles William Elliot</a>, President of Harvard no less, was still able to claim that \"the existence of atoms is itself an hypothesis and not a probable one. All dogmatic assertion upon it is to be regarded with distrust.\" Others saw value in the atom, but only as a tool. Elliot's contemporary,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_William_Williamson\">Alexander Williamson</a>, president of the London Chemical Society, caught the prevailing mood: \"On the one hand, all chemists use atomic theory, and\u2026 on the other hand, a considerable number view it with mistrust, some with positive dislike.\" Their experiments were rubbing their noses in atoms but chemists didn't much care for the smell of something they couldn't see, however useful the concept.</p> <p>Around the same time physicists&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell\">James Clerk Maxwell</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann\">Ludwig Boltzmann</a> had taken up atomic theory to explain the physical properties of gases. Their statistical approach to the kinetic theory, which supposed the pressure of a gas to be due to the collisions of atoms with the sides of its container, produced a mathematical treatment of elegance and power. It immediately explained, for example,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle\">Robert Boyle's</a> 200-year-old law that reducing the volume of a gas increases its pressure. For Maxwell and Boltzmann the truth of their equations was enough to convince them of the reality of atoms and molecules.&#xa0;</p> <p>But not everyone was won over. The tide may have been turning, but it was slow going. Boltzmann's complex statistics on colliding atoms proved too much for those like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Ostwald\">Wilhelm Ostwald</a>&#xa0;who, ironically, did not like the simplicity of the notion: \"The proposition that all natural phenomena can ultimately be reduced to mechanical ones cannot even be taken as a useful working hypothesis: it is simply a mistake.\" I sense that the lack of visuals remained a stumbling block. Even if atomic theory explained the pressure of gas in a glass vessel, a gas-filled vessel still looked identical to an empty one. The atomicity of the gas couldn't be seen or felt, only inferred from the numbers game.&#xa0;</p> <p>The final validation of atomic theory came in the early 20th Century. During the course of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#1905_-_Annus_Mirabilis_papers\">1905</a>,&#xa0;as he&#xa0;was working&#xa0;out the photoelectric effect, special relativity and establishing the equivalence of energy and matter, Albert Einstein also found time to publish a theoretical treatment of Brownian motion.&#xa0;</p> <p>Scottish biologist Robert Brown had observed the constant jiggling motion of pollen grains suspended in water with his microscope in 1827. But it wasn't until Einstein took up the problem and theorised that the movement was due to the constant bombardment of the pollen grains by water molecules, that the phenomenon was finally wrapped in respectable mathematical clothing. His short paper (<a href=\"http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins_brownian.pdf\">PDF</a>) produced an equation that predicts how far, on average, a grain will move in a fixed period of time. Five years later in 1910 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Perrin\">Jean Baptiste Perrin's</a> careful measurements showed that the equation worked beautifully. A grateful Einstein wrote to the Frenchman, \"I would have considered it impossible to investigate Brownian motion so precisely; it is a stroke of luck for this subject that you have taken it up.\"</p> <p>With these experiments the final resistance to the reality of molecules and atoms withered. Even Ostwald was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Ostwald#Career_and_research\">won over</a>. To be sure, the congruence of mathematical theory and experimental observation helped to pave the way but I like to think it is the <em>visibility</em> of Brownian motion that put real flesh on the idea.

Would the prime minister humiliate himself? More selfishly, would he make the rest of us look bad by association?</p> <p>Back in London, commentators had been unanimous: Downing Street's decision to accept the Late Show's invitation was a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2208666/Arab-Spring-says-David-Cameron-ahead-Letterman-appearance.html\" title=\"\">\"high-risk move\"</a>, potentially a <a href=\"http://www.theweek.co.uk/politics/49195/cameron-boldly-goes-where-boris-has-gone-letterman\" title=\"\">\"trap\"</a>, thanks to Letterman's \"biting\" humour and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2208674/Andrew-Mitchell-Has-Chief-Whip-lost-control-fate.html\" title=\"\">\"relish in embarrassing his guests\"</a>.</p> <p>The American media consensus, by contrast, was that the referees had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/26/nfl-referee-lockout-could-end-reports\" title=\"\">made some really bad calls in a football game on Monday night</a>, and that the crooner Andy Williams had died. The encounter between two of the most comical men named David in the English-speaking world barely merited a mention.</p> <p>In the event, each combatant in the clash of David versus David seemed merely to baffle and faintly annoy the other, two crabby men divided by a common language. According to advance reports of the interview, Letterman had peppered Cameron with questions from a mock UK citizenship test, several of which the prime minister had bungled.</p> <p>This might have made for good television \u2013 except that no such explanation was included in the televised version, so Letterman's randomly lobbed history trivia questions: What does Magna Carta mean in English? Who composed Rule Britannia? (Cameron knew neither), seemed entirely without purpose. Letterman spent much of the rest of his time asking deliberately dumb questions: What is the deal on Wales? \u2013 while Cameron spent his trying to sneak in references to the London Olympics.</p> <p>At one point, he told an anecdote about being approached on the street in Manhattan by a New Yorker who recognised him from prime minister's questions and told him: \"I love your show!\"</p> <p>It was meant as a laugh line, but not many people in the audience laughed. He got a cheer when he mentioned that British political parties were prohibited from advertising on television. But that was an exception.</p> <p>All of which only served to underline what an odd decision it had been for Cameron to become the first serving British prime minister to appear on Letterman's show. Not because of the host's alleged rapier wit (yes, he's smarter than Jay Leno, but so are some crustaceans) but because there could never have been any upside. It could only prove embarrassing, or be forgotten.</p> <p>The official justification, that Cameron would \"bang the drum for British business\", seemed the flimsiest of alibis, leaving it hard not to conclude that the prime minister had simply been seduced by the glamour of American late-night television \u2013 and, perhaps, a desire to outshine Boris Johnson's pre-Olympic visit to Letterman's sofa. The London mayor will doubtless be satisfied to learn Cameron failed to do so.</p> <p>\"I hope I haven't been too annoying,\" Letterman concluded. Their parting handshake proved as awkward as the rest of it. And then, not soon enough, it was over, presumably leaving a few hundred thousand sleepy American viewers to wonder vaguely, as their eyelids drooped, exactly which Downton Abbey actor it was they'd been watching.</p>",
  "<p>Muslim leaders in Kenya fear a new anti-terrorism bill will give more powers to a widely distrusted police force that is suspected of involvement in the disappearances of several Muslims with alleged links to Somalia's al-Shabaab militant group.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.africog.org/kptj/statements/aboud_rogo_killing\" title=\"\">disappearances, and the killing last month of radical Muslim cleric Aboud Rogo in Mombasa</a>, have enraged Kenya's Muslims, who make up about 11% of the population, with the majority living along the Indian Ocean coast.</p> <p>After Rogo was gunned down by unidentified assailants, Muslims in the Indian Ocean city <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/killing-of-muslim-cleric-riots-kenya\" title=\"\">torched churches, looted shops and hurled grenades at police</a>.

The friend is still missing.</p> <p>\"The moment it is cloaked in the war on terror, nobody gives a damn \u2026 That's where I really feel very frightened about what is going on,\" Kimathi said.</p> <p>The police did not respond to requests for comment, but in the past, officers have suggested that some of the disappearances could have been the result of infighting among al-Shabaab sympathisers.</p> <p>Kimathi said some of the missing people probably had cases to answer with the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU), but that inefficiencies within the police and courts were hampering investigations.</p> <p>\"They reach a point where they get frustrated by the law and the court process and they have realised that the only way to deal with these people is to 'disappear' them,\" he said.</p> <p>Rogo was on US and UN sanctions lists for supporting al-Shabaab and reportedly had close ties to the Muslim Youth Centre, a Kenya-based ally of the Somali militants. Khan had been charged with recruiting for al-Shabaab.</p> <p>Kenya has a long history of extrajudicial killings, and the prospect of security agencies being given more powers under the new anti-terrorism bill worries many observers.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.protectionline.org/IMG/pdf/report.pdf\" title=\"\">a 2009 report</a>, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Philip Alston, said: \"Kenyan police are a law unto themselves. They kill often, with impunity.\"</p> <p>Ben Rawlence, a senior researcher for <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>, said the recent disappearances were part of this pattern. \"There is no real oversight or judicial control of the police. That structural lawlessness is very concerning,\" he said.</p> <p>In its current form, the anti-terrorism bill, which is due for a second reading in parliament this week, would increase the powers of the police to detain people on suspicion of terrorism, as well as to use techniques such as phone tapping. Rawlence said that \"anything that increases the police's freedom of operation \u2026 is unlikely to be good for human rights\".</p> <p>Hassan Ole Naado, the head of the <a href=\"http://kmya.org/\" title=\"\">Kenya Muslims Youth Alliance</a>, said one concern was how quickly the bill was being pushed through. \"Powers that ought to be the judiciary's powers are now being given to the police force and the executive \u2026 Those powers are prone to terrible abuse,\" he said.</p> <p>Kimathi said the ATPU felt able to act with impunity because of ties with US counter-terrorism forces in a volatile region where Kenya is viewed as an ally, but also a potential target for al-Shabaab and a source of recruits.</p> <p>Kenya receives millions of dollars in funding from the US state department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA), <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2011/195541.htm\" title=\"\">as well as training and FBI assistance on investigations</a>. Kimathi said he believed the ATPU worked under the direction of the FBI. Asked to comment, an information officer for the US embassy in Nairobi said: \"The FBI is in Kenya at the invitation of the Kenyan government to work with the Kenyan police.\"</p> <p>Kimathi also said members of a notorious police death squad, known as the Kwekwe and supposedly disbanded in 2007, were possibly involved in the recent disappearances.</p> <p>The battle against al-Shabaab outside and inside Kenya has sharpened divisions between Muslims and other communities, especially since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/somali-islamists-threaten-kenya-attack\" title=\"\">Kenyan troops crossed into Somalia last October and al-Shabaab threatened to retaliate</a>.</p> <p>Most Somalis are Muslim and some Kenyans have begun to equate Muslims with Somalis, and with al-Shabaab.</p> <p>Kimathi described how a man he challenged over dangerous driving typified these attitudes. \"He looked at me, and said: 'Come on, who do you think you are? You are al-Shabaab \u2026 We'll take you back to Somalia, all of you.' So that is now what is getting into society. Any Muslim that you see is an al-Shabaab \u2026 He is a guilty person.\"</p>",
  "<p>Growing up in the 1980s and 1990s co-operatives seemed like a relic of bygone era. This was partly because of the political and economic climate of the time \u2013 the Thatcher and Major governments revered dynamic self-starting individuals and their exciting high risk businesses \u2014 but also because co-operatives had a low profile.</p> <p>I don't remember ever seeing the <a href=\"http://www.co-operativebankinggroup.co.uk/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1166431280866&amp;pagename=Corp/Page/tplCorp\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group's Bank</a> or shops advertised on TV. In fact, co-operatives were rarely mentioned in the media at all beyond occasional documentary footage of Tony Benn's ill-fated attempts to prop up failing motorbike factories in documentary footage reminding people of the ideals that Thatcher had destroyed/what would happen if the Labour Party ever got back into government again.</p> <p>I always liked the idea of co-operatives businesses, though and in the early 2000s, when I was working in Kentish Town in London, I often dropped into the local Co-operative supermarket hoping to buy something. Unfortunately, that was easier said than done because at the time, the Kentish Town shop was less a small supermarket, more a marginally better decorated homage to the grocery stores of the pre-perestroika USSR. Most days, there was hardly anything on the shelves.</p> <p>I also got an account with the Co-operative Bank but \u2014 in the days when it was still important to be able pay in cheques in person \u2014 that meant either longer than average journeys to the nearest branch or highly restricted choice of where to live.</p> <p>Then the social enterprise movement began to gather momentum, enthusiastically backed by the New Labour government. Many of the organisations promoting social enterprise had their routes in the co-operative movement but, while there were plenty of stories about the 19th century exploits of the Rochdale Pioneers, modern day co-operatives were rarely mentioned at social enterprise events.</p> <p>According to the report <a href=\"http://www.uk.coop/resources/documents/good-business-new-market-research-co-operatives\" title=\"\">Good Business? \u2013 Public perceptions of co-operatives</a>, published by Co-operatives UK in 2010 based on research conducted by Yougov the public's position is that: \"40% associate (the term co-operative) with being \"old-fashioned\" (conversely 33% apply the term \"modern\").\" It's a confusing picture but probably a fairly accurate in the sense that co-operatives may be both old fashioned and modern at the same time. Co-operative approaches to doing have a long history in the UK but are also very much back in fashion. The 'Good with Food' ad for Co-operative supermarkets is firmly in the public consciousness.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.uk.coop/economy2012\" title=\"\">The Co-operative Economy 2012</a> report outlines the growth of the co-operative sector in recent years.</p> <p>In 2011 co-operatives grew by 8.9% and between 2008 and 2011, by 23%.</p> <p>In 2011, the co-operative economy grew by 1.5%, outperforming the UK economy for the fourth consecutive year. The co-operative economy has grown by 19.6% since 2008 while the UK economy in 2011 is 1.7% smaller than in 2008. The total turnover of the co-operative economy, \u00a335.6bn</p> <p>Membership also grew by 5.5% in 2011 and between 2008 and 2011 by 19.7%. There are13.5 million members now.</p> <p>Earlier this year, The Co-operative Bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/19/co-op-lloyds-branches-high-street-bank\" title=\"\">agreed a deal to take control of 632 Lloyds TSB branches</a>, taking on nearly five million new customers amounting to 7% of the UK current account market. Potential new customers will no longer need to make a choice between their ethics and the opportunity to use a local branch.</p> <p>Since the economic crisis began in 2008, people have become more suspicious of other forms of business and are embracing co-operatives. According to the Good Business report, while only 29% of the public associated conventional PLCs with the term 'trusted', 66% associated co-operative businesses with it.</p> <p>Policy guru Charles Leadbeater considers co-operatives a good idea.</p> <p>Leadbeater, formerly a leading Blairite thinker, previously announced the arrival of social enterprise in the UK in <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/socialentrepreneur\" title=\"\">The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur</a> and also popularised 'the knowledge economy'. In March 2012, he wrote a paper published by the thinktank IPPR and supported by Co-operatives UK, called <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publications/55/8769/its-cooperation-stupid\" title=\"\">It's Co-operation Stupid</a>. In it he explained that: \"We live in a society where people prize both individual freedom of expression and the ability to collaborate and connect\" and pointed towards 'Our co-operative future' explaining that: \"Cooperation \u2013 far from seeming quaint and anachronistic \u2013 could come to define the spirit of the times, to be successful and modern, aspirational and dynamic.\"</p> <p>Now that the 30-year-pursuit of winner takes all economics has come to a juddering halt, it looks like co-operatives and co-operation could be a big part of what comes next.</p> <p><em>David Floyd is managing director of </em><a href=\"http://www.socialspider.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Social Spider CIC</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Some GPs are failing to show enough compassion, refusing to refer patients to consultants and striking off those who complain about their treatment, claims a new report by the Patients Association.</p> <p>Too many patients feel their family doctor communicates with them poorly, does not involve them in decisions about their care and can be rude and dismissive, the charity says.</p> <p>Analysis of the experiences of NHS primary care relayed by a sample of 500 patients who called its helpline between January and June this year shows a small but growing minority of patients have major concerns about how their GP treated them.</p> <p>Katherine Murphy, the association's chief executive who is a former NHS nurse and hospital manager, highlighted concerns among those receiving primary care: \"The vast and overwhelming majority of care and treatment is delivered superbly by dedicated clinicians. However, as in the rest of the NHS, the small minority of cases of bad care translate into large numbers of patients that, for a multitude of reasons, have cause to be dissatisfied with the contact they have had with the primary care sector.</p> <p>\"This is a problem that is growing. It is equally clear that the standard of care being provided on some occasions goes beyond 'poor' and is actually rude, disrespectful and harmful to the patients' health.\"</p> <p>Of the helpline's 8,000 calls a year, the proportion referring to GPs rose sharply from 11% in 2011 to 25% in the first half of this year. The commonest complaint (26%) was about patients receiving too little information about their treatment or follow-up appointments or about the GP appearing unsympathetic, unwilling to listen or refusing to let patients discuss what they had been told.</p> <p>Among the 500 patients in the sample, only 60% said their GP treated them with compassion, 39% rated their GP's communication skills as five or less out of 10 and 80% said they wanted to be more involved in decisions about their care.</p> <p>One in eight calls were from patients who said they had been unable to get a referral to see a hospital consultant or had to chase the GP to secure an appointment. Another 10% had been struck off their GP's list without receiving any warning after raising a concern about their care.</p> <p>The report comes weeks after the General Medical Council, which regulates doctors, said complaints against doctors had risen 23% in the last year, of which 47% were against GPs. Complaints to the GMC about doctors overall have jumped 69% in the past three years.</p> <p>Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GPs' committee, said the report was hard to reconcile with the last Department of Health survey of patients' experiences, which found that 88% rated their overall experience with their GP practice as good and 93% had trust and confidence in the last GP they saw.</p> <p>However, although based on a small number of patients, Vautrey said the findings highlighted some real concerns. Some patients were being denied the chance to see a consultant because of \"arbitrary\" money-saving limits set by NHS primary care trusts that restricted GPs' ability to refer patients to hospital. He said that could pose a medical risk to a patient whose condition was not picked up.</p> <p>\"GPs are working harder than ever before and the pressure on their time is greater than before,\" Vautrey said. \"They would like to spend more time with patients but, if you do that, then the total number of appointments available is reduced. We would never sanction rudeness, no matter how much pressure a GP is under. But we need to put the small numbers in this report into the context of the three million people a week who access primary care services.\"</p> <p>Lord Howe, the health minister, sympathised with the concerns raised in the report. \"Patients should be treated as people rather than as a condition, illness or an NHS number \u2013 this is the modern health service we are working to achieve,\" he said.</p> <p>He claimed the coalition's NHS shakeup \"will redesign health and care services around the needs of the individual and the local community where they live. Control is being handed to local doctors and nurses who best understand what their patients need, rather than a one size fits all NHS\".</p>",

He accused the British government of violating Assange's human rights, saying he could be stuck in the embassy in London for 10 years, which would have a severe impact on his health.</p> <p>Assange, dressed in a shirt and half-knotted tie, appeared tired and unwell on the video. He had dark rings under his eyes and sniffed frequently during a prepared presentation. Assange focused largely on Barack's Obama address to the UN on Tuesday in which the president gave a staunch defence of freedom of speech, and voiced American support for the revolutions in the Arab world.</p> <p>Assange said that it was \"audacious\" for the US government \"to take credit for the last two years of progress\", given past American support for the ousted Arab dictators. He said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/20/tunisian-fruit-seller-mohammed-bouazizi\">Mohammed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street pedlar</a> whose suicide from despair over his life in January last year sparked the revolt, \"did not set himself on fire so that Barack Obama could get re-elected\".</p> <p>He added that it was \"disrespect to the dead to claim that the United States supported the forces of change\".</p> <p>Instead, Assange claimed that it was the leak of classified US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, allegedly by a US soldier in military intelligence, Bradley Manning, that \"went on to help trigger the Arab spring\".</p> <p>Referring to Obama's UN defence of the freedom of expression, Assange pointed to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/29/bradley-manning-torturous-holding-conditions\">treatment of Manning in US prison</a>, where he was held in isolation, stripped and left naked for hours in his cell, and to the denunciation of WikiLeaks by American leaders.</p> <p>\"The time for words has run out. It is time to cease the persecution of our people and our alleged sources. It is time to join the force of change, not in fine words but in fine deeds,\" Assange said.</p> <p>Assange and the Ecuadorean government argue that if he goes to Sweden to face the sexual assault allegations against him, he could be extradited from there to the US to face politically-motivated prosecution. The Sydney Morning Herald <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/us-calls-assange-enemy-of-state-20120927-26m7s.html\">has published what it described as declassified US air force counter-intelligence reports</a> which designated Assange and WikiLeaks as \"enemies of the United States\", the same legal category as al-Qaida and the Taliban.</p> <p>The British government said it is legally obliged to carry out Assange's extradition after the Australian's appeals in the British courts were rejected. It has also said that according to European law, it would not allow extradition to the United States on charges that could result in the death penalty. Pati\u00f1o argued that the UK's human rights obligations overrode its duty under EU treaty.</p> <p>\"The United Kingdom says it defends human rights,\" Pati\u00f1o said. \"Would it be human to try to keep Mr Assange in the embassy for months or years?\" He added that Assange might spend up to 10 years in the embassy \"without right to his life or his privacy\".</p>",
  "<p>Police have detained Google's most senior executive in Brazil after the company failed to take down a YouTube video attacking a mayoral candidate in alleged violation of electoral law.</p> <p>Google is appealing against the charges against Fabio Jose Silva Coelho, who was released after he agreed to co-operate with the case, according to a police statement.</p> <p>\"Google is providing clarification to legal authorities,\" a company spokesman in S\u00e3o Paulo said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The questioning came a day after a state court in S\u00e3o Paulo banned an online video that sparked violent protests across the Muslim world, giving Google 10 days to pull the video from its YouTube unit. Google has not been formally notified about that case, according to a company spokesman.</p> <p>Taken together, the legal scrutiny represents the strongest pressure Google has yet faced in Brazil to control third-party content uploaded to its websites and the first time its senior executives have come under such intense fire.</p> <p>But rather than reflecting a coherent national policy, the cases illustrate how aggrieved citizens can get a sympathetic hearing from local judges with extensive procedural powers.</p> <p>In Google's case, judges have held executives responsible for resisting the removal of online videos in violation of a stringent 1965 electoral code. The law bans campaign ads that \"offend the dignity or decorum\" of a candidate.</p> <p>Earlier this month an electoral court in the state of Para\u00edba ordered the arrest of another senior Google executive, Edmundo Luiz Pinto Balthazar, after the company refused to take down a YouTube video mocking a mayoral candidate there.</p> <p>The video clip loaded by the user Para\u00edba Humor seized on a verbal slip by a candidate in a montage remarking, \"What an idiot - give him an F!\"</p> <p>Within days another judge overturned the order to arrest Balthazar, writing that \"Google is not the intellectual author of the video, it did not post the file, and for that reason it cannot be punished for its propagation.\"</p> <p>The company also defended users' political rights in a statement at the time.</p> <p>\"Google believes that voters have a right to use the internet to freely express their opinions about candidates for political office, as a form of full exercise of democracy, especially during electoral campaigns,\" the company wrote.</p> <p>Google faces frequent legal scrutiny over the limits of users' expression in Brazil, where it opened an office in 2005.</p> <p>Over the years, the company has received repeated requests from Brazilian authorities to reveal the identity of bloggers and users of its social networking site Orkut, whose posts violated local libel and anti-racism laws.</p> <p>In the second half of last year, Google removed four Orkut profiles after an electoral court order, the company said on a portion of its website called the Transparency Report.</p>",

That is bad, I have ended my career on your show tonight,\" the prime minister said, after struggling when Letterman fired a series of questions at him.</p> <p>Shifting slightly awkwardly in his seat, Cameron first ran into trouble when Letterman asked him who composed the music for Rule Britannia after the band struck up the music from the Last Night of the Proms. \"Elgar,\" he said uneasily. \"You are testing me,\" he added.</p> <p>Letterman waited until near the end of Cameron's appearance to point out that Thomas Arne composed the music, and that the poem was by James Thomson.</p> <p>Letterman picked on Rule Britannia to remind the prime minister that Britain once had an empire on which the sun never set. Cameron showed a better grasp of American history as he rattled through Anglo-American relations. \"We had a bit of a falling out, [though] I think we are getting over that,\" the Oxford PPE graduate said. \"We interfered in your politics 200 years ago when we sailed up the river and burnt the White House.\"</p> <p>Cameron asked to become the first sitting prime minister to appear on the Letterman show, recorded at the legendary Ed Sullivan Theatre on Broadway, to fly the flag for British business. He told Letterman he was \"shamelessly\" exploiting the afterglow of the Olympics and Paralympics.</p> <p>Cameron retrieved his honour when asked to explain the difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He summed up the partition of Ireland in a few seconds and went on to praise the Queen's visit to Dublin last year. He made one minor slip when he said she was the first member of her family to visit since independence. The Prince of Wales has visited on numerous occasions.</p> <p>The interrogation turned to Magna Carta. \"1215,\" he shot back when asked the date it was signed. It took him a few minutes to give the venue \u2013 Runnymede \u2013 before delivering a first class essay about its significance in checking the powers of the English crown.</p> <p>But he did not know the English for Magna Carta. Cameron's university chum, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, who has appeared on the show, will no doubt be chuckling. Letterman eventually ended Cameron's agony, explaining it meant Great Charter.</p> <p>Letterman's producers gave the show a southern English middle class theme, providing the US audience with a guide to the British class system. The other guest was the British actor Jonny Lee Miller, who made his name in Trainspotting. Miller, the former husband of Angelina Jolie, is from Kingston, Surrey, and was educated at Tiffin, a local grammar school.</p> <p>Mumford &amp; Sons, the folk rock band from Wimbledon, offered a song from their new album Babel. Marcus Mumford, the lead singer, was educated at King's College School. As an Etonian, Cameron represented a higher step on the ladder of the English private school system.</p> <p>Cameron, who ran rings round Jeremy Paxman during the 2005 Tory leadership contest, took care to prepare for his encounter with Letterman. One joke doing the rounds was that Sir Kim Darroch, Britain's national security adviser who has a quick and dry humour, would stand in for Letterman in rehearsals.</p> <p>In the end the Cameron prep team, led by his communications director and former television news editor Craig Oliver, fired a series of questions at him. Top of the list were queries about the Queen after the Letterman team told No 10 they were fascinated by the British monarch after her walk-on part in the James Bond section of the Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>The Cameron team studied with care Johnson's appearance on the Letterman show in June, when the mayor was asked how long he has been cutting his hair. \"That's a low blow,\" New York-born Johnson replied with a smile.</p> <p>Barack Obama was given a reasonably easy ride on the show this month when he appeared after the leaked video in which the Republican presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, appeared to write off 47% of the US electorate. The prime minister watched a recording of Obama's appearance as part of his preparation.</p> <p>One senior British source said: \"It is just a good opportunity. Britain has had an extraordinary year with the Jubilee, with the Olympics and with the Paralympics. We have got something good to shout about. So getting out there talking up Britain is important.</p> <p>\"We should never forget that we are the biggest investor in America, America is the biggest investor in us. There is a saying in business that when you want to do better you go back to your biggest customers and try and squeeze out a bit more.\"</p> <p>Cameron sought to show a modern Britain. Letterman did his best to counter that in laying the ground for Cameron's appearance by releasing dry ice to depict \"London fog\".</p>"
