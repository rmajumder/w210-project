  "<p>Lance Armstrong fell further from grace on Thursday when another sponsor announced it had abandoned the shamed former cyclist. A day after Nike became the most high-profile company to state it no longer wanted to be associated with the American, bike-parts maker Sram took the same stance.</p> <p>\"Sram is officially terminating its product sponsorship agreement with Mr Armstrong,\" the company said in a statement provided to ESPN. \"Sram is disappointed with the revelations that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/11/lance-armstrong-denials-usada-detail\" title=\"\">Usada report has brought forth</a>. Moving forward, Sram will maintain its support of the Livestrong Foundation, as we believe in its purpose and value.\"</p> <p>Armstrong, who stood down from his position as chairman of his Livestrong cancer charity on Wednesday, used to have a small share in Sram, but that was brought out when the company was taken over by a private equity investment firm in June 2011.</p> <p>The list of brands to turn their back on Armstrong in the wake of the Usada report into the 41-year-old's doping, and the subsequent stripping of his seven Tour de France titles, is a long one, with Sram joining Nike, Anheuser-Busch, brewers of Budweiser, Trek bicycles and Honey Stinger, a maker of foods and gels for athletes. Radio Shack were reported to have dumped Armstrong too.</p> <p>However, sunglasses maker Oakley, have decided to stick by the Texan. In a statement posted on Twitter, the company said: \"As guilty as the evidence shows, which we completely acknowledge, it is our promise and contractual obligation to stand by our athletes until proven guilty by the highest governing body of sport, or a court of law.</p> <p>\"We might be last off, but we are not going to jump on the bandwagon as it breaks our promise to all of our athletes. We will wait for the UCI's conclusion and act at that time.\"</p>",
  "<p>The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has announced plans to set up a dedicated unit at city hall to secure new sites for free schools. The move is part of his ambition to gain strategic oversight over education across London to drive up standards further, despite the capital already outperforming the rest of the country.</p> <p>The mayor, who has no formal powers over school education, will also announce on Friday his intention to set up a \"London curriculum\" for lower secondary school children using the city as an \"educational tool\". A new fund to promote teaching excellence and help tackle underperformance \u2013 particularly in literacy and numeracy, science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 will also be made known. City hall said the Department for Education had given its support for the fund \"in principle\", subject to further discussions.</p> <p>The mayor, a champion of the government's school reforms, intends to set up a \"New Schools for London\" unit to help groups wishing to open a new school but struggling to find sites in a city with high land and property costs. Johnson signalled plans to offer up land and some of the property portfolio owned by the Greater London Authority, though he stressed this would be through \"working closely\" with councils and the Department for Education.</p> <p>There has been huge speculation over the mayor's ambitions to lead the Conservative party following a high-profile summer and a star turn at the party's autumn conference. However, an aide insisted his plans are not an attempted political land grab over education but a desire by Johnson to use his role to \"add value\" to the education system.</p> <p>London remained the best performing region in England and Wales for the fourth year running after summer's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/18/gcse-exam-pass-rate-falls-for-first-time-in-decade\" title=\"\">GCSE results</a>, with 61.3% of students achieving five or more GCSEs at grade A* to C including English and mathematics, compared with the national average of 58.6%.</p> <p>Johnson sees trying to improve standards as a logical extension of his mayoral role over skills, training and employment in the capital. He will say on Friday that although many schools and teachers were doing \"a sterling job\", too many young Londoners were leaving school without the skills to get on in life. \"I want our youngsters to aspire to the highest echelons and be inspired to be the best they can be. That's why I will use the resources available to us to enable more free schools to be built across the capital. We should also maximise the potential of London's cultural and historical assets to strengthen the curriculum in our schools.\"</p> <p>Johnson's announcement will coincide with the launch of the final report of a 10-month education inquiry at Pimlico Academy, which has recently secured the go-ahead for a new primary free school to be built.</p> <p>Despite lauding the fact that \"a London education is the best in the country\", the report stresses the need to go further \u2013 an estimated 15,000 children left London primary schools still struggling with English, maths or both.</p> <p>Other recommendations by the 11-strong inquiry panel include: summer schools for primary school teachers to \"consolidate and deepen their subject knowledge in English and maths\" and a \"gold club\" of schools that are \"bucking the trend of low aspiration and underachievement\" and can share their practice.</p> <p>The report seeks to head off critics who will say that it is identifying a democratic gap resulting from the government's drive for free schools and academies, free of local authority control, by insisting the call to give the mayor strategic oversight is not a bid to recreate the Inner London Education Authority, which was abolished by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, or a \"bureaucratic middle tier\" but about a \"shared vision\" for education in the city.</p> <p>Johnson's deputy mayor for education and culture, Munira Mirza, insisted that Johnson was not engaged in a power grab. \"We are asking for funding to support the free schools unit but we are not asking for formal powers or any legal changes,\" she said. \"We are asking for the tools to help London education.\"</p> <p>Mirza, who confirmed she would oversee education on behalf of the mayor, claimed the government reforms had created an unprecedented opportunity for school leaders to innovate, improve and learn from each other. \"It isn't about a democratic deficit,\" she said. \"The mayor feels through regional government he can add value to the system.\"</p> <p>Though London is the only region with an elected mayor at the helm, Mirza said there was nothing stopping other cities setting strategical priorities for their region in a similar way.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the education secretary, welcomed the mayor's intervention. He said: \"I know the mayor is incredibly ambitious for London's children and wants to ensure all schools reach the high standards set by the best. I look forward to working with him to provide greater challenge and rigour, improve performance and generate innovative practice \u2013 and to seeing what lessons London can teach the country as a whole.\"</p> <p>London Councils, the umbrella body for local authorities in the capital, said the report \"rightfully recognises the absolutely vital role councils play in the education system\".</p> <p>\"This week the Leaders of London's 32 boroughs signed up to a detailed set of proposals outlining how we can work closely with schools, parents and communities, as well as with the Mayor, to ensure that the London's schools continue to improve and that every child is able to find a good school place near to where they live.</p> <p>\"We are particularly concerned that academies and free schools must be open with parents about how they are performing so parents can make informed choices about which schools they trust to educate their children. These schools are funded with public money and they must be publicly accountable for it. We need the government to understand that central control of all 24,000 will not work and that local councils have a key role in making sure all schools are accountable to the communities they serve.\"</p>",

The difference between this year's San Francisco Giants team and the one that won the World Series two Octobers ago can be summed up the following fact: It's game four of the National League Championship Series and the Giants are at a disadvantage tonight because Tim Lincecum is starting.</p> <p>Yes, the two-time Cy Young winner has been having a disastrous season, to the point where he has been working out of the bullpen during these MLB Playoffs. Now, however, <a href=\"http://www.mccoveychronicles.com/2012-nlcs/2012/10/18/3522324/tim-lincecum-we-put-our-trust-in-thee\">the Giants need him to be Timmy</a> to avoid falling into a 3-1 NLCS hole to the St. Louis Cardinals. Giants' ace Matt Cain was on the mound yesterday afternoon for a rain delay extended Game 3, and pitched well, but the Giants offense could do nothing against the Cardinals pitching. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/17/san-francisco-giants-st-louis-cardinals-nlcs-game-3-live\">The Cardinals won the game 3-1</a> and effectively took control of the series.</p> <p>Of course, the Cardinals themselves aren't in a perfect position here for a guaranteed win. Tonight's starter Adam Wainwright, a one time Cy Young candidate himself, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/13/st-louis-cardinals-washington-nationals-nlds-game-5-live\">hasn't been quite himself this postseason</a> after a year where journeyman starter Kyle Lohse has jumped him in the rotation. More ominously, the Cardinals lost Carlos Beltran yesterday to a knee injury and his status is in question for the rest of the series (he may be able to pinch-hit tonight). It didn't hurt them yesterday, of course, as Beltran's replacement Matt Carpenter his the two-run home run that proved to be the difference maker.</p> <p>Because that's what it's like to be the St. Louis Cardinals, the luckiest team in baseball history. Maybe the most productive player in modern postseason history goes down, so St. Louis replaces him with a stretched-out pinch-hitter who responds by hitting the difference-making homer in his first opportunity. This is why the Giants have to be scared of St. Louis, they've clearly made some sort of deal with the Baseball Gods.

  "<p>The former chief legal adviser to the army in Iraq has said the UK's complicity in the unlawful treatment of detainees was \"institutional\" and must be wiped out to prevent future abuses by British troops.</p> <p>Colonel Nicholas Mercer described how he was gagged by the Ministry of Defence after he criticised senior British commanders and MoD officials in the case of Baha Mousa, who died while in the custody of British troops.</p> <p>Giving the annual Baha Mousa memorial lecture, Mercer said his attempts to set up independent judicial monitoring of the treatment of detainees were blocked by the MoD. Britain's obligations under domestic and international law were routinely ignored, he added.</p> <p>\"Apply the rule of law and this [abuse] will all go away, it is as simple as that\", Mercer said. He called on all public servants to end \"torture by the state\". Mercer, who is now a Church of England vicar, recalled how in May 2003 \u2013 four months before Mousa's death \u2013 he drew up an order, known as a 'Frago' in which he referred to \"a number of deaths\" of individuals in the custody of British soldiers. He stated: \"The detained person should be treated with humanity and dignity at all times. They should not be assaulted. They should be provided with water in all cases and food if they are detained for longer. If they need to be restrained then this should only be affected were absolutely necessary and using the minimum force required. Under no circumstances should their faces be covered as this might impair breathing. Medical assistance should be close to hand at all times.\"</p> <p>Mercer said no action was taken by UK commanders at the permanent joint headquarters in Northwood, north-west London, in response to his order.</p> <p>Mercer said that after he gave evidence to the Baha Mousa court martial (where one defendant, a corporal, pleaded guilty, while the others were acquitted for lack of available evidence), he was banned from speaking to any lawyer who was not in the army, and to journalists.</p> <p>Any speeches he made had to be \"checked and expurgated so a 'correct' version could be delivered\". He also said he was told by the MoD that he was \"not a suitable person\" to give lectures on how human rights bound troops on operations abroad.</p>",
  "<p>As political liquidations go, it is a massacre that ranks alongside some of the worst excesses of the 20th century: at least 20,000 Iranians executed in prison in the 1980s.</p> <p>Yet it received scant international attention. Unlike the carnage of Srebrenica or the purges of General Pinochet's coup in Chile, there was little worldwide outrage, and no opportunity for justice and legal redress.</p> <p>But this month the killings, perpetrated by then-Ayatollah Khomeini's regime, will be examined by an independent tribunal in The Hague in a process that exposes the shortcomings of the international justice system.</p> <p>The hearing, aimed at uncovering the truth of what occurred in Iran's jails, highlights the selective nature of what goes before the UN's courts and special tribunals. Founded in 2007 because no official judicial body would investigate complaints against Iran, it is a cross between a people's truth commission and a formal legal indictment.</p> <p>It is based on the model developed by a private international war crimes tribunal established in 1966 by Bertrand Russell and Jean-Paul Sartre to investigate the US war record in Vietnam.</p> <p>The focus of the Iran tribunal is the mass executions carried out inside the country's jails from 1981-89 of political prisoners, men and women. About 4,500 people, many teenagers and from leftwing groups, died in summer 1988 alone, according to Amnesty International.</p> <p>Iranian exiles claim 20,000-30,000 prisoners died in total \u2013 victims of a fatwa issued by Ruhollah Khomeini, then head of state. The extent of the killings has been largely ignored by the west.</p> <p>British lawyers on the tribunal's legal steering committee include Prof John Cooper QC and Sir Geoffrey Nice, a former prosecutor at the international criminal court (ICC) and Gresham professor of law. Other founders were the former South African minister Kader Asmal, who has since died, and the UN rapporteur on Palestinian human rights, Prof Richard Falk. All are unpaid.</p> <p>In a<a href=\"http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/international-criminal-tribunals\" title=\"\"> recent lecture, Nice drew attention to the gaps in international justice</a>. \"War crimes courts and tribunals established over the last 20 years have changed the way the world citizen can think,\" he said. \"As a result the world citizen may assume that they, like national courts, are part of a coherent, judicial crime and punishment system that happens to be international. Nothing could be further from the truth.\"</p> <p>The choice of conflicts for judicial intervention was highly selective, he said. \"The ICC suffers a further, significant and probably irremediable defect&#xa0;\u2026 The treaty-based permanent court has been ratified by only 121 of the approximately 200 countries of the world.</p> <p>\"The US, Russia and China in particular are not members. The court is not good enough for their citizens, it would appear. Yet they are happy to send citizens of other non-ratifying countries like Sudan or Libya to the court for trial through a security council resolution.\" Iran has also failed to ratify it.</p> <p>The tribunal, Nice said, was a two-stage process intended not just to leave a record but to hold the regime accountable for its crimes against humanity.</p> <p>\"This is a conflict that would never be selected for international attention despite its gravity. The informal tribunal \u2013 that may be matched by others and by other internet and computer-assisted processes yet to be imagined \u2013 shows that the world citizen can hope courts will serve him well, but can easily find the means to do much of the job himself if they don't.\"</p> <p>The first stage of hearings took place in London this summer at Amnesty International's premises. About 75 witnesses, many surviving detainees, gave evidence \u2013 some in person, others via video.</p> <p>By choosing the Peace Palace, home to the UN's international court of justice, the Iran tribunal hopes to acquire some of the authority of its surroundings. The final sessions will be from 25-27 October.</p> <p>Hamid Sabi, a London-based lawyer who fled Tehran in 1979 and one of the organisers, has not had a response to his invitation to the Iranian government to attend the sessions.</p> <p>\"Until a few months ago no one spoke about this in Iran but as a result of [the tribunal] so many Iranian papers began talking about it. [The government] response was: 'Yes, we did kill them in prison but we were entitled to under international law.'</p> <p>\"It's known as the 'bloody decade'. Thousands of people were murdered and tortured. In some cases families were simply told to come and collect their bodies. We have around 17,000 names. The fatwa in 1988 ordered that all those fighting the regime, such as the mujahideen, were apostates. If they did not embrace Islam, as he [Khomeini] believed it, they should be killed. It resulted in the mass liquidation of the prison population.\"</p> <p>Thousands of prisoners were brought before committees and asked whether they renounced their political organisations, were Muslims, prayed, believed in the Islamic republic and were prepared to walk through Iraqi minefields.</p> <p>According to evidence given to the tribunal they were given a few minutes to consider. A negative answer resulted in their being taken out and hanged on cranes or shot. Women were reportedly raped before execution. Bodies were often dumped in mass graves; many have never been recovered.</p> <p>\"Most of the prisoners didn't know what was happening,\" Sabi said. \"It took years for the families to put their forces together. They wrote to the UN rapporteur on human rights in Iran, they wrote to the UN human rights committee. No one was interested. So they set up the tribunal.\"</p> <p>Most of the funds, he said, came from the families. \"We have not taken money from any corporation or government. We have had witnesses from extreme Muslim groups through to Maoists. Half of them were former prisoners. One woman lost four brothers.\"</p> <p>The London sessions were broadcast online and on the last day, thousands and thousands of people were watching around the world.</p> <p>Some leftwing groups have criticised the tribunal for stoking resentment against Tehran at a time when Israel threatens a strike at its nuclear facilities.</p> <p>\"It will be a people's court in The Hague,\" Sabi said. \"We have no power or jurisdiction but we have moral authority. Perhaps it will remind everybody that one day they may have to answer for crimes they have committed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Easy as it is to see why politicians talk so readily about gas and electricity prices, it is even easier to see why they should be extremely cautious about doing so. A big, international subject that is both technically complex and \u2013 since the privatisations of the 80s \u2013 largely outside direct government control, complaining about the energy market is about as effective as heckling a jumbo jet.</p> <p>Yet ignorance or quietude aren't political options. After all, gas and electricity bills are one of the biggest headaches in any household. Like petrol prices and council tax, fuel bills are a very visible cost: they land on your doormat regularly and each time they are more expensive. Britain's long boom ended in 2007; since then, combined gas and electricity bills for households have gone up nearly 50% to \u00a31,280. This is why Ed Miliband makes such a point of talking about fuel prices, most recently in his party conference speech in Manchester last month. It's also why David Cameron started the new parliamentary term this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/energy-minister-tariffs-row-deepens\" title=\"\">by announcing a new initiative on energy prices</a>. With British Gas leading the market over the past week in raising fuel prices, what better way for an increasingly unpopular prime minister to show he still has the popular touch? Having done so, however, Mr Cameron has made the most awful hash of things. To call his energy announcements this week a dog's breakfast would be to insult the doubtless fine folk at Pedigree Chum.</p> <p>At prime minister's questions on Wednesday, the Conservative leader declared: \"We will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers.\" That was a strong promise; it also came as a strong surprise to most of his cabinet colleagues \u2013 including, it was admitted yesterday in parliament, to Ed Davey and the rest of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). Meanwhile, the power industry began a counter-offensive, warning that Mr Cameron's proposals would drive out competition in the market. And in less than 24 hours, government officials were suggesting a much diluted compromise, in which there would not be legislation, exactly, more a commitment. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-policy-video\" title=\"\">bravura bit of flak-catching by energy minister John Hayes</a> in parliament yesterday (Mr Davey being otherwise engaged, apparently) could not dispel the charge that has lingered around most government policy announcements since George Osborne's budget: shambles.</p> <p>While his actual idea was hopeless, Mr Cameron's proposal does contain a germ of analytical truth: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/video/2012/oct/18/patrick-collinson-energy-tariffs-not-working-video?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the energy market really is broken</a>. There as many as 1,756 different energy tariffs, according to Which?, yet three-quarters of customers are on the most expensive ones. While suppliers will offer tempting rates to new customers (the minority with the time and energy to switch on a regular basis), they treat their existing base as mere feedstock. And when one jacks up its prices, the rest follow in lockstep. None of this has been helped by having an industry regulator in Ofgem that is sleepier than Rip van Winkle. All the evidence is that over-complexity in tariffs and options does not help customers: telecoms regulator Oftel admitted as much in its investigation of the 118 directory-inquiries market. Yet Ofgem lets this mischievous complexity flourish in its own backyard.</p> <p>A serious analysis of the energy-retail market would begin with the recognition that it is an oligopoly. There are six big names in the industry and they control everything from production to trade to supply to billing. Potential competitors have to subsist on scraps of niche business or go bust. Faced with this, politicians can make one of two broad responses. Either they smash up the Big Six, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/8785711/Ed-Miliband-Labour-will-break-up-big-six-energy-firms.html\" title=\"\">as Labour is suggesting</a>, by forcing them to sell their energy into an exchange (as happens in Germany), or they nationalise the utilities. Mr Cameron's proposal \u2013 as far as it is possible to make one out \u2013 is an unhappy halfway house, which leaves the Big Six in charge but also disavows any faith in the market actually working. The prime minister is effectively heckling planes.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 We have had reason to speak in the recent past of Oliver Letwin, the government's chief thinker/philosopher. Who can forget that memorable occasion when he was caught throwing constituents' letters into a park bin. Or his mauling by Bernard Jenkin, who said that his Tory colleague <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/20/hugh-muir-diary-russia-putin-friends\" title=\"\">didn't know what he was talking about</a>. Well Olly's back, older; no wiser \u2013 and this time his travels take him to a primary school where <a href=\"http://www.viewfrompublishing.co.uk/news_view/22561/7/1/bridport-mp-shocks-children-with-views-on\" title=\"\">pupils seek counsel from their MP on cycling safety for children</a>. \"I must tell you that I am against legislation that would make wearing cycle helmets compulsory. I think things like that should be down to the individual,\" Olly tells the 10- and 11-year-olds. \"I personally don't think that wearing seat belts in cars or wearing helmets on motorbikes should be compulsory either.\" We are not advocating forcing everyone, protests one pupil, only children. \"I think people of nine or 10 can make these decisions for themselves,\" counters Olly. \"Do you care at all about children's lives?\" asks an outraged pupil. Of course, says Olly, but a free life comes with \"a certain amount of risk\". Years of road safety advice and policy, dismissed in an instant by the brain at the heart of the coalition. Still, if they had wanted good sense, they would have called on someone else.</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Marland perhaps. He's a fount of wisdom and humour. This week he told peers he was using a taxpayer-funded trip to sub-Saharan Africa to \"keep the suntan up\". The Daily Mail, as one might guess, did not approve. \"Extraordinary boast made by David Cameron's new trade minister,\" was its early take. But then the anger subsided. Maybe someone helped to calm things down. For yesterday when one looked for the story on Mail Online, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2218993/Lord-Marland-I-just-trying-sun-tan-Extraordinary-boast-David-Camerons-new-trade-minister-jetted-Africa.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">it simply wasn't there</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Did someone intervene? Prince Charles, maybe. He has a view on most things and he is not afraid to convey it; even if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/17/prince-charles-policy-britain-run\" title=\"\">he is wary of letting the public know what it is</a>. The prince has fingers in many pies, and one of them is Prime \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.prime.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise</a>. It is, the website says, \"the only national organisation dedicated to providing everyone over 50, who is unemployed or under threat of redundancy, with the support to achieve financial, social and personal fulfilment\". Over 50? Facing redundancy? Charles is 64 this year.</p> <p>\u2022 To company news, and let's check the fortunes of Elbrus Consultants Ltd. The accounts for February 2011 to February 2012 reach us. We are underwhelmed. The company has \u00a314,448 in the bank, and is owed another \u00a316,200, but owes \u00a326,194. Thus its assets, less liabilities, amount to \u00a34,454. Nothing to bother Bill Gates or interest Warren Buffett. Still, it's early days, and there is an argument that Elbrus director Andy Coulson may have been distracted by this and that over the reporting period. Police investigations, criminal proceedings, Leveson. There's no Peston here, but we see three possibilities: things may pick up, get worse, or stay the same.</p> <p>\u2022 And chancellor George Osborne is in big trouble for apparently <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenpolitics/9617946/Environment-groups-challenge-George-Osborne-over-deeply-offensive-Taliban-slur-claims.html\" title=\"\">referring to climate change protesters as the \"environmental Taliban\"</a>. An extraordinary comment for a senior member of Big Dave's \"greenest government ever\". Still, George never was bound by decent convention. It all rings true, for we are told that the Osbornites have developed a robust enthusiasm for fracking. It has become their litmus test of environmental credibility. \"The view is that if you are in favour of fracking, you have the balls for the fight. If you're against, you're not worth bothering with,\" a source tells us. A Taliban-like inflexibility, don't you think?</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, here comes the cavalry. \"Why doesn't anyone stand up for Jimmy Savile?\" asks Charles Moore in the Spectator. \"Is there no priest who will testify that the man was a repentant sinner, no unmolested child grateful that Jim Fixed It for him? Sir Jimmy should keep his knighthood.\" Abuse will be hard to prove. And \"if you insist on sucking up to these Pied Pipers of our age, you take the consequences when one of them leads the kiddies off under the hill.\" We await the petition.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",

It's another thing to have the sharply partisan House of Representatives break an Electoral College tie in the runner up's favor.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-18T21:30:48.349Z\">at 10.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508065d158f96784ee2906db\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-18T20:25:53.851Z\">9.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Best Senate campaign ad of 2012</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Heidi Heitkamp</strong>, the <a href=\"http://heidifornorthdakota.com/about-heidi/how-heidi-works-for-north-dakotans/\">Democratic candidate</a> for the vacant <strong>North Dakota</strong> US senate seat, is running a brilliant campaign out on the prairie \u2013 and this is her latest ad.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVr9cirHglk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gVr9cirHglk?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>That is awesome for so many reasons.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/senate/nd/north_dakota_senate_berg_vs_heitkamp-3212.html\">RealClearPolitics rates the North Dakota election as a toss-up</a> between Heitkamp and Republican candidate Rick Berg, and the single recent poll agrees, with a 47% split.

  "<p>A freshly aired audio recording in which Mitt Romney asks business owners to talk with employees about the upcoming election sounds at first like a throwback to the bad old days of voter clientelism. That's the term academics use for the time-honored American practice of trading something nice for political support.</p> <p>Voters used to be able to get a shot of whiskey or a pair of boots. Now, in the era of expanding corporate rights, you might just get a half-promise not to be fired \u2013 as long as you vote the right way.</p> <p>Romney was speaking on a conference call that was sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/advocacy/item?cmsid=58241\">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a>, as part of a series that had previously featured Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann. He had been talking about why Barack Obama is bad for business. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuMHuVlIW0&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=26m44s\">Then he encouraged employers to \"make it very clear to your employees\" how they feel about the presidential race</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope you make it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections. And whether you agree with me or you agree with President Obama, or whatever your political view, I hope \u2014 I hope you pass those along to your employees. Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business, because I think that will figure into their election decision, their voting decision and of course doing that with your family and your kids as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>The recording, which was first spied by <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing/\">In These Times</a>, has generated consternation on the left. It came to light in the same week that Mike Elk of In These Times reported that <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/Koch/KOCH1.pdf\">the Koch brothers, David and Charles, had sent 45,000 employees packets containing actual lists of candidates supported by Koch Industries</a>. At the top of the list of approved candidates was Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Is it legal to do this? On the conference call, Romney went out of his way to say that it is, when he said: \"Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees...\" </p> <p>Romney has drawn a similar distinction in describing his strategy for paying taxes, saying: \"I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more.\" In Romneyland, legal compliance is a lofty moral paradigm.</p> <p>Romney also happens to be right: bosses can talk to employees about whom to vote for. Corporations can send political mailings to employees. And since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision, corporations appear to have new freedom to force employees to attend political events like the Romney rally in Beallsville, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81421.html\">in which coal miners were forced to appear as campaign props</a>.</p> <p>Citizen United's generous interpretation of corporate speech means that employers \"may now be able to compel their employees to listen to their political views at [workplace] meetings on pain of termination,\" <a href=\"http://yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal-pocket-part/volume-120/addressing-political-captive-audience-workplace-meetings-in-the-post%11citizens-united-environment/\">wrote Paul Secunda, an associate law professor at Marquette University, in the Yale Law Journal</a>. \"Although federal law does still prevent employers from issuing explicit or implicit threats against employees who vote for the 'wrong' candidate, short of that, nothing prohibits employers from requiring employees to participate in one-sided political propaganda events.\"</p> <p>Employees have little real-life protection from aggressive attempts by employers to sway their votes, Secunda said in a phone interview Thursday.</p> <p>\"Workers are facing a constant stream of political pressure, 16 hours a day, a stream of literature,\" he said. \"This stuff has always taken place, especially in the blue-collar workplace. It's generally legal.\"</p> <p>The federal voter intimidation statute, which makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten, or coerce\" voters, is rarely called on to protect workers, he said.</p> <p>\"The devil's in the details,\" Secunda said. \"What does it mean to 'intimidate' as far as preventing the right to vote? An express type of threat? Some of these more implicit types of power dynamics don't explicitly meet this high standard.\"</p> <p>Some states have their own voter intimidation laws, Secunda said, but a paucity of relevant case law indicates a low level of enforcement.</p> <p>\"Employers are pretty much able to do what they want as far as putting pressure on employees to vote against a certain candidate,\" he said.</p> <p>Secunda said a new \"Federal Worker Freedom Act\" was needed, to prohibit employers from engaging in mandatory political indoctrination. A new law could comply with Citizen United's broad interpretation of corporate speech, he said.</p> <p>\"The focus is not on employers' speech,\" Secunda said. \"You can't interfere with that. The focus would be on regulating employer conduct.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 6 November, Californians will get a chance to vote on Proposition 36, which would reform some elements of its highly controversial \"three strikes\" law and bring it in line with other states by closing a loophole that has allowed thousands of low level offenders to be locked up for life. As the law currently stands, anyone convicted of a third strike offense \u2013 something as minor as stealing a slice of pizza or possessing a joint of marijuana \u2013 will be sentenced to life in prison. Prop 36 would change that to ensure that only people convicted of a serious, or violent, third strike will feel the full force of the law.</p> <p>The measure enjoys <a href=\"http://www.yeson36.org/endorsements\">the support of a broad coalition of conservatives and liberals</a>, from Grover Norquist to Cory Booker, and from prosecutors to police chiefs. If the measure passes, as is expected, it will go some distance to undo some of the worst excesses of the three strikes law. Unfortunately, it doesn't go nearly far enough.</p> <p>When the three strikes law went before voters in 1994 \u2013 then as <a href=\"http://library.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1994g.pdf\">Proposition 184 (pdf)</a> \u2013 the measure was sold as a means of achieving the desirable goal of keeping repeat violent and dangerous felons behind bars for life. It was also meant to save the taxpayer \"$23bn over five years\". The law came about in response to the public outcry over the kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas by a repeat felon. But even at the time, the law was met with strong opposition, including by the Klaas family itself, because of fears that the majority of people who would be convicted under the proposition would be non-violent offenders and because, as written, the law \"treats non-violent crimes the same as murder, rape and armed robbery\". Actually, it treats them worse.</p> <p>The maximum sentence for rape (that does not include kidnapping) in California is eight years; the average sentence is five. The sentence for second-degree murder is 15 to life. But a man or woman convicted three times of snatching a purse, or three times of stealing a shovel from a garden shed, will be sentenced to life in prison. I wish I could say I was exaggerating here for the sake of emphasis, but when it comes to <a href=\"http://www.threestrikes.org/tscrimes.html\">California's three strikes law</a>, there are so many low level offenders \u2013 well over 3,000 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/stanford-three-strikes-project\">mostly struggling with drug addiction or mental illness</a>, who have had their lives obliterated by this misguided piece of legislation, no such exaggeration is required. Burglary of a residence, even when it's unoccupied and when there is no weapon involved, counts as a serious felony. All robberies, including snatching a purse or taking anything by force, even when nobody is hurt, count as violent felonies, in the same category as murder, sodomy and rape.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/25/california-three-strikes-law\">January of this year</a>, I wrote about Jeremy Stewart, a 25-year-old father of two small children who was sentenced to 70 years under the three strikes law for breaking into two unoccupied homes and stealing jewellery. These two break-ins counted as his third and fourth strike (his priors were also burglary and coming into possession of stolen goods). So, in his case, the normal 25-to-life sentence was doubled to 50-to-life, and the judge threw in an extra 20 years for no reason anyone can explain to me \u2013 apparently, just to make absolutely sure this young man (who was struggling with drug addiction) never gets to see his children outside a prison visiting room again. Jeremy's mother tells me that his 70-year sentence was upheld recently in an appeals hearing, and Jeremy will not be eligible for any reduction of his sentence under Prop 36 because burglary counts as a serious felony. </p> <p>At least, if Proposition 36 passes, there will be hope of sentence reductions for approximately 3,000 people who were awarded life sentences for non-serious crimes like possessing less than a tenth of a gram of a narcotic or for stealing a loaf of bread. This week, the California parole board will be considering the compassionate release of a 59-year-old grandmother named <a href=\"http://www.yeson36.org/profiles\">Bernice Cubie</a>, who has an advanced form of terminal cancer. Bernice has already served 14 years of her three strikes life sentence. Her third strike was for possession of less than $10-worth of drugs; her two priors were nonviolent burglaries (stealing to feed an addiction).</p> <p>Earlier this year, the parole board denied her release on the grounds that she may still be a danger to society \u2013 this despite the fact that she was never violent and she is dying. At the time of writing, the parole board has yet to reach its decision on the second request for compassionate release, so I cannot tell you how it's panned out for her. But at least if Prop 36 passes, men and women like Bernice who commit non-serious offenses, like drug possession or forging a check, will not be awarded a life sentence.</p> <p>That alone makes the measure well worth passing. Beyond the obvious injustice of locking people up for life for petty crimes, there is an economic argument to be made. California is spending <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2009/08/13/111843426/folsom-embodies-californias-prison-blues\">approximately $9bn a year</a> on its prisons, and its penitentiary system has a healthcare budget of $2bn, 90% of which is devoted to inmates over 55. Sentencing just one young person to a lifetime in prison will cost taxpayers well in excess of $3m, depending on his or her healthcare needs.</p> <p>When imposing life sentences on petty offenders, then, the question should be asked whether the threat they pose to society is really worth that kind of investment. Proposition 36 is an important step in curbing some of the worst excesses of the three strikes law, but there is still a long way to go to restore justice and a sense of proportion to California's penal system.</p>",

  "<p>It was the printer's error that wiped about $20bn from the value of the world's biggest search engine. Shares in Google were suspended after an accidental email to the US stock market authorities revealed that the company's latest quarterly results were far below Wall Street's demanding expectations.</p> <p>The inadvertent \u2013 and clearly unfinished \u2013 financial release began with the words \"PENDING LARRY QUOTE\" \u2013 referring to the company's chief executive, Larry Page, whose job, normally, would be to put the best gloss on the financial figures. But he was likely to be offering different sentiments after the stock tumbled 9% before trading was halted. After trading resumed the shares recovered slightly to close down 8%.</p> <p>Company results circulate internally for several days as they are being prepared for public release to strict timetables, normally under strict secrecy. Leaks of the figures are extremely rare, but on this occasion Google tersely blamed financial printers RR Donnelly for filing its draft third quarter results \"without authorisation\".</p> <p>Compounding the situation was the fact that Google's figures missed expected profits and a showed a big slowdown in revenue growth for its main search engine advertising business. The company had little choice but to suspend trading in its nosediving shares.</p> <p>The surprisingly poor figures also point towards the challenging future that has already hobbled Facebook's stock after its dismal flotation earlier this year: the problem of making money from mobile advertising as users shift from the desktop to the smartphone to do their searching.</p> <p>The figures showed that Google earned $9.03 per share in the third quarter \u2013 notably below analysts' consensus estimates of $10.63. Its search engine revenues were also below expectations, hitting $11.5bn (\u00a37bn) where analysts had expected it to show $11.9bn (\u00a37.38bn).</p> <p>Nevertheless, even Google's misfiring revenues showed 19% growth from the same period last year. But, critically, that was a substantial slowing for a business that had consistently shown revenue growth since the end of 2009, when the global financial crisis was at its deepest.</p> <p>A key reason for the revenue and profit miss seemed to be a fall in \"cost per click\" \u2013 the amount that advertisers pay when people click on Google's adverts. Google said that such revenues fell by 15% year on year and by 3% compared with the second quarter, even while the number of \"paid clicks\" grew 33% year on year.</p> <p>Advertising rates for mobile phone advertising are typically lower than on desktop computers \u2013 rates that are in turn lower than for printed media. At the same time, as noted by Ben Schachter from Macquarie Securities, people used search engines less for the first time since anybody began tracking data showing their use \u2013 because people are discovering new content via apps on iPhones and other smart devices. That also suggests that the widespread shift to mobile use which has affected Facebook's prospects is starting to affect Google too. </p> <p>Another concern for Google will be the upwards creep in \"traffic acquisition costs\" (TAC) - the money that it pays to external websites to direct traffic to its search engines. That has risen as a proportion of advertising revenue from a low of 23.7% a year ago to 26% \u2013 back towards the 30% figure that it saw at the end of 2007. The higher the proportion, the higher the drag on profits on a search engine. Those too may come from Google's mobile business, where it pays money to Apple for some positions on the iPhone, and to some mobile carriers.</p> <p>Charlie Kindel, a former Microsoft general manager who worked on its Windows Phone development, commented on Twitter that Google might have to start focusing on ways to make its free Android mobile operating system pay. He said: \"Mark my words: a few more quarters like this, Amazon doing well with Kindle, and Google's approach to Android will quickly change.\" Amazon uses its own version of Android, stripped so that Google gets no ad revenue, in its Kindle Fire tablet.</p> <p>But Clark Fredricksen, vice-president of eMarketer, which tracks the online advertising business, said that despite the setback he feels that Google is in a strong position because of its underlying strength. Google remains dominant in search, with a 74.5% share of the US search ad market, according to eMarketer. In Europe, its market share is more than 95% \u2013 and the overall digital advertising market in the US grew by 17.7% in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>Fredricksen added: \"The company now holds the largest more revenue than any other company in the US search, display and mobile advertising markets, respectively \u2013 and the company's market share in each category is expected to grow in the coming years. Particularly in the mobile arena, Google holds a commanding lead over all other players, taking home more than half of all US mobile ad revenues. The nearest competitor, Pandora, takes home less than 10% of the market.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, a sheepish printer said it was \"fully engaged in an investigation to determine how this event took place and are pursuing our first obligation \u2013 which is to serve our valued customer\".</p> <p><strong> </strong>Its shares fell too in the wake of the Google leak \u2013 but only by 2%.</p> <h2><strong>Tech giants lose their touch</strong></h2> <p>The titans of Silicon Valley are beginning to lose their air of invincibility. Since Google's initial public offering in 2004, American technology companies had enjoyed an unprecedented run of good fortune, culminating in Apple's overthrow of oil giant Exxon Mobil as the world's most valuable business. But one by one, through a combination of greed, hubris and clerical error, the masters of the technology universe have been shooting themselves in the foot.</p> <p>First came Facebook's catastrophic initial public offering, when early investors cashed in their chips at too high a price. The shares skidded remorselessly downwards, and now trade at half their float value.</p> <p>In September, it was Apple's turn. The launch of the iPhone 5 lit up the internet, and sales have been spectacular, but within days of its arrival in the shops the company's chief executive Tim Cook had apologised for forcing a substandard mapping service on his customers. By giving Dublin and imaginary airport and turning Helsinki railway station into a park, Apple had proved itself capable of releasing a poorly designed, unfinished product. Now Google has made the same mistake, in the form of its latest financial results.</p> <p><strong>Juliette Garside</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012 to correct the title of Charlie Kindel.

  "<p>Phillip Bailey knows there are people worse off than him working inside the gigantic Walmart warehouse that dominates the small town of Elwood in rural Illinois.</p> <p>He sleeps at a Catholic hostel in nearby Joliet and so has a solid roof over his head after a day of helping the endless flow of consumer goods supplying Walmart stores across America. Not all his colleagues can say that. One squatted in abandoned houses. Another lived rough in the woods in between work shifts. \"He just set up a tent in there for a few weeks,\" Bailey said.</p> <p>Bailey is a warehouse worker in the outsourced Walmart supply chain that criss-crosses America, part of one of the most vulnerable workforces in the US. Bailey and his colleagues work for low pay and minimal benefits. Their recruitment is subcontracted out to myriad staffing agencies, and working conditions can involve tough, repetitive manual labour. Critics say it is a labour market reminiscent of countries like China, yet it exists here in the American heartland of the Midwest.</p> <p>But Bailey and many other Walmart warehouse workers say they have to endure an especially shocking hardship: wage theft. Already very low-paid, they allege their pay packets are sometimes skimmed and squeezed by the staffing agencies subcontracted to employ them.</p> <p>\"They prey on people living in precarious marginal circumstances. People living on the edge. If that was not the case, they could not do what they do,\" Bailey said.</p> <p>The former green energy worker from Detroit has now joined a class action lawsuit recently filed against Roadlink Workforce Solutions, who supply staff to Walmart's Elwood warehouse. The case alleges numerous ways in which wages are stolen or underpaid.</p> <p>One method is for workers to be asked to appear for a shift, only to be sent home when not chosen for work. Despite turning up at 6.45am or earlier, they say they often receive no pay for their time. Elsewhere, workers say they are paid no overtime, or have time worked rounded down to the nearest whole hour. They also say retaliation for speaking out is common, which also results in lost wages.</p> <p>After the suit was first filed, Bailey said, he was sent home early from his shift, seeing his pay packet cut. Another Roadlink worker at Elwood who is joining the complaint, Holly Kent-Payne, 25, said that she has simply not been paid for one day's work. \"My first pay check, they did not pay me for a whole day. That's a whole day of my life gone,\" she said.</p> <p>A spokesman for RWS declined to comment on the case.</p> <p>But the suit against Roadlink is just the tip of the iceberg. Since 2009 there have been five other suits filed against five different staffing companies which feed workers into the 3.4m sq ft Elwood warehouse. Of those cases, two have been confidentially settled. They, too, described wage theft.</p> <h2>'It is not easy to get by'</h2> <p>Leticia Rodrigues worked at Elwood at the end of last year. She says she found herself often being paid by the task \u2013 effectively per truck or shipment of goods. Often jobs were so large she had to get other workers to help or take extra hours on her own time. That meant her wages dipped below the legal hourly minimum. \"It would happen two or three days out of a four day week,\" she said.</p> <p>Robert Hines, who worked at Elwood in 2010, also says he was a victim of wage theft at Elwood. He described being asked to show up when no work was forthcoming. Hines says he was summoned into the warehouse, getting up at 4.30am to arrive at 5.30am, and was then finally being inspected by managers at 7am. Then, he says, he \u2013 along with most other workers brought in \u2013 were sent home, as all the available shifts had been doled out. There was no compensation for their time. </p> <p>\"I felt like an idiot. That's my time. That's less money to feed my family, less money to put clothes on their backs,\" said Hines, 39.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the workforce recruited for the warehouse industry \u2013 whether in Illinois or in other major hubs like New Jersey or the Inland Empire in California \u2013 is highly vulnerable. Many do not stay on the job for longer than a couple months. Few last a year.</p> <p>Mike Compton, 36, works in Elwood but has spent time living in abandoned houses in Joliet. \"I found one abandoned house that had working electricity still. And a fridge,\" he said. He reckons that if he worked all 52 weeks of the year \u2013 he has no paid vacation \u2013 he would bring home a total annual salary of just $15,000. \"It is not easy to get by,\" said Compton.</p> <p>Workers' rights campaigners say the Walmart supply chain is set up in a way that makes wage theft likely. They say Walmart's vast commercial power and relentless focus on driving down costs squeezes the margins of firms it subcontracts its supply chain out to. Those firms, in turn, squeeze their own subcontractors as they eke out a profit. At the bottom of this process are the workers.</p> <p>The Elwood warehouse, for example, only shifts Walmart goods. But it is run by logistics giant Schneider. In turn, Schneider outsources most staffing to recruitment agencies. Those layers of outsourcing, critics say, have led to an exploitative industry where wage theft becomes part of the system.</p> <p>\"There are lots of low-skilled, low-paid workers and its easy for employers to chisel away at them. Wage theft is rampant in this industry. It is a perfect storm for wage theft,\" said Cathy Ruckelshaus, an expert on the warehousing industry at the National Employment Law Project.</p> <p>Leah Fried, an activist with Warehouse Workers for Justice which is seeking to organise warehouse employees in Elwood, was more blunt. \"Is it their business model to rob people? Because it seems that way,\" she said.</p> <h2>A good business model?</h2> <p>Stopping that practice is the aim behind the repeated lawsuits against wage theft. Chicago lawyer Chris Williams, who lodged the Roadlink suit, said such legal steps were often the only recourse for workers unaware of their rights or afraid to speak out. \"The hope is Walmart and its subcontractors will decide this is not a good business model because they keep getting sued,\" he said.</p> <p>Schneider spokeswoman Janet Bonkowski said the firm held its subcontractors to high standards. \"When we utilise third-party vendors, we contractually require full compliance with all required laws and that all parties conduct business ethically,\" she said.</p> <p>Walmart spokesman Dan Fogleman pointed out that Walmart was not named in the RWS suit and had taken steps to police standards in its supply chain. \"We take allegations of workplace issues very seriously,\" he said. Fogleman added the company had not uncovered any systemic problems, but is drawing up a protocol for third-party run warehouses in the future that will include random inspections by an independent group.</p> <p>But there has already been worker unrest at Elwood. Recently hundreds of workers and supporters gathered outside the gates of the gigantic facility and held a rally. Police in riot gear were called and several people were arrested, including local religious leader Pastor Craig Purchase.</p> <p>\"The system is a modern version of sweatshop labour from the early days. I had to get involved,\" he said. His arrest was the first time he had ever been detained by police.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the US, conditions in the outsourced parts of the Walmart supply chain have also been the focus of protest. In the Inland Empire in California, a lawsuit was launched at a Schneider-run warehouse in Mira Loma that alleged wage theft by staffing agencies hired by the company to recruit workers.</p> <p>At other warehouses in southern California, unsafe working conditions have been the subject of complaints to the state's labour board, and there have also been walkouts, strikes, and a six-day \"march to the sea\" by scores of warehouse workers trying to highlight their complaints.</p> <p>Critics say that Walmart has a responsibility to these workers, even though it keeps responsibility for them at arm's length by layers of subcontracting. \"Walmart knows there is a problem,\" said Ruckelshaus.</p> <p>Certainly Bailey sees Walmart as the ultimate beneficiary of the wages he says are lost to Roadlink. The sums are not much \u2013 just a few dollars here and there as hours are rounded down or he is summoned for work and then turned away.

  "<p>The British heavyweight Tyson Fury has apologised for making abusive comments about the British and Commonwealth champion David Price \u2013 and for a tweet posted on his timeline which said \"dont like gays shoul all b shot dead\".</p> <p>Fury is already facing possible action from the British Boxing Board of Control after posting a video on Twitter which said: \"David Price, I'm going to put you in intensive care, that's for sure mate. And you know your gay lover Tony Bellew? He's got to fight me in between the rounds as well. I want the two of you, you pair of tossers.\"</p> <p>But Fury, who also called Price a \"shithouse scouse prick\" on Twitter this week, insists that a homophobic tweet which suggested all gay people should be shot was not posted by him.</p> <p>\"I was out of order for calling people names and the outbursts I've done, and I'd like to apologise for that,\" he said. \"But the tweet was nothing to do with me.</p> <p>\"As you know, I get a lot of abuse on Twitter,\" he told the Guardian. \"And while I'm abroad on training camp I train three times a day often for two hours a time, and I haven't got time to respond to all the people that ask questions. So I give my phone to my cousins at the camp. They're only young lads and they give abuse back. Today I've come back and they were laughing about calling some people some names and whatever.</p> <p>\"When I found out what they had done I was furious. I said: 'Listen, it's not a funny subject this. You shouldn't get involved in people's sexuality.' And I've got the phone back off them instantly and explained to my followers that those comments weren't mine.</p> <p>\"I've got friends of my own who are gay and it's the 21st century so who cares who is gay and who ain't?\" he added. \"People who know me will tell you I've had many a good night out with a few gay people I know. Whatever they are it's none of my business and it's got nothing to do with boxing.\"</p> <p>Fury said he wished the Puerto Rican boxer Orlando Cruz, who recently came out as gay, all the best in his world title eliminator on Friday, adding: \"Give him my number and we'll go for a beer.\"</p> <p>The unbeaten 24-year-old also admitted that he was upset by the constant abuse he has received on Twitter. \"I get a lot of stuff calling me a Gypsy or my wife is an inbred pikey, or that I mess around with my sister. It's terrible. Right now it seems to be there's a story about me every day but I want to make headlines for the right reasons.</p> <p>\"I am boxing again on December against a top-10 WBC-ranked opponent and I'll be announcing my opponent shortly.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile the Stonewall director of public affairs, Ruth Hunt, has urged sports stars and governing bodies to do more to tackle homophobia and to make gay people welcome in sport.</p> <p>She said: \"Orlando Cruz, in his own words, now feels able to be true to himself. He acknowledges this will make him a happier man and a better boxer. Unfortunately, anti-gay abuse of the kind we saw on Tyson Fury's Twitter feed is far too common across a number of sports, meaning many gay people will be put off following Orlando's example.</p> <p>\"Governing bodies have to accept that people perform best when they can be themselves. There should be no room for homophobia in any sport.\"</p>",
  "<p>The boss of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch requires male models who work as stewards aboard his private jet to wear boxer briefs, flip-flops and a \"spritz\" of the retailer's own brand aftershave, it has been claimed in a US court case.</p> <p>According to an \"aircraft standards\" manual, male flight crew are told to present themselves clean shaven in a uniform of Abercrombie polo shirts, boxer briefs, jeans, flip-flops and gloves (black for when handling silverware and white for laying the table) while working on Abercrombie chief executive Michael Jeffries' executive jet.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2012/oct/19/abercrombie-fitch-aircraft-standards-manual?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">extraordinarily detailed manual</a>, which also requires crew to play <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRY1NG1P_kw\" title=\"\">Phil Collins' Take Me Home</a> over the jet's intercom as the jet takes off on homeward bound flights, was disclosed in an age discrimination lawsuit brought by a former pilot.</p> <p>The document,<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-18/models-on-abercrombie-jet-had-rules-on-proper-underwear.html\" title=\"\"> seen by Bloomberg News</a>, also reportedly bans flight crew from wearing coats, unless the temperature falls below 10 C (50F).</p> <p>It also details the seating arrangements of Jeffries' dogs Ruby, Trouble and Sammy, and instructions on how to address the boss. \"When Michael, Matthew [Smith, Jeffries' partner], or a guest make a request, respond by saying 'No Problem'. This should be used in place of phrases like, 'Sure' or 'Just a minute',\" the document states, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>The manual is also said to refer to the role of a \"houseman\" in a detailed section about the boarding of dogs on the plane.</p> <p>The lawsuit containing the manual was filed at a Philadelphia court in 2010 by Michael Stephen Bustin, a 55-year-old pilot who claims he was replaced by a younger man. Documents filed in court since then have highlighted Jeffries' tight control on the company and its staff.</p> <p>Abercrombie pays the salary of four cabin crew provided by <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitanmanagement.com/\" title=\"\">model agency Cosmopolitan Management</a>, according to a 2009 agreement with Jet Aviation Business Jets. Cosmopolitan, which lists Abercrombie as a client online, states on its <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitanmanagement.com/\" title=\"\">website</a> that it provides \"professional male and female models, expertly groomed and trained to host your event, promotion, product launch, or opening.\"</p> <p>Abercrombie's general counsel, Rocky Robins, told Bloomberg that Bustin's claim was without merit. The company declined to comment to the Guardian.</p> <p>Jeffries, 68, has previously faced investor pressure over excessive use of the company's jet. In 2010 the board agreed to pay him $4m to limit his use of the company jet to $200,000 worth of travel a year.</p> <p>His focus on youth and vitality had been a key part of Abercrombie's success, with attractive topless male models stationed outside stores. Between 1995 and 2008 the clothing chain's sales increased 22-fold and net profits almost 58-fold.</p> <p>But it has struggled in the recession and same-store sales are expected to fall 10% in the second half of the this year after an 8% drop in the six months to the end of July.</p> <p>The firm has previously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/apr/28/abercrombie-fitch-savile-row\" title=\"\">hit the headlines over claims of degrading its staff</a>. This year Italian male staff claimed they were forced to do press-ups as punishment. In 2009, a former UK employee, Riam Dean, took Abercrombie to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born with the lower part of her arm missing, claimed she was forced to work in the London store's stockroom because she didn't fit the company's strict \"look policy\", a guide to the appearance of its shopfloor staff. She was awarded \u00a38,000 for unlawful harassment.</p>",

He assaulted, abducted, brutally raped and murdered my beloved daughter and then fled back to Slovakia. Thanks to the dedication of the Strathclyde police, the cooperation of the Slovakian police and the EU arrest warrant, this serial criminal was brought back to the UK and is serving a minimum of 25 years in prison and will then be deported. When the lord advocate announced his criminal conviction at the end of his trial (and 13 previous convictions, at least four for violence), I thought a mistake had been made in letting him into the UK. I was appalled to learn that it was the norm for EU citizens to come in unchecked.</p> <p>Since then I have met with two home secretaries and written to many ministers, MPs and MEPs in my attempts to have changes made in the law so that other families' lives would not be torn apart like ours.

I am more than disgusted. It shows total disregard for victims everywhere and for the increased number of citizens throughout the EU who will become victims if this proposal goes ahead. Police investigations will be severely hampered and fighting some crimes well nigh impossible. Is this another way to enable government to further reduce police budgets? I am totally bewildered and can think of no logical reason for this.I thought that in a big society folks were meant to look our for each other. Our big society will become more and more splintered, with more criminals, more victims, more fear.

  "<p>Only when the red deer stags have finally ceased their bellowing does the profundity of the night's silence become apparent. There is not a man-made sound to be heard, no distant voices, no sound of car engines near or far, no planes overhead. Neither are there natural sounds, there is no sound from cattle or sheep, no calling from the geese down on the machair. There is no wind to ruffle the surface of the loch and set the water lapping against the shore or to set the autumn-dry grass stems rustling.</p> <p>The air is chill and fine as silk. And the sky is filled with stars. More stars than I ever remember seeing before. I search for familiar constellations and in doing so find others whose shapes are just as distinctive but whose names I do not know. A shooting star burns a brief bright arc across the heavens. Jupiter, larger and brighter than any of the stars, hangs low in the sky and I take up my binoculars to look for its moons and having found them scan the sky again\u201a and catch my breath as amorphous pale smudges sharpen to reveal more constellations and behind them more, field after deepening field of stars revealed in a night of astonishing clarity.</p> <p>And all the while, the northern sky glows with a turquoise green light, a light made more intense by the depth of the darkness that surrounds it. It rests on the horizon, a luminous band of&#xa0;colour lighting the night sky in the way the lingering afterglow of a sunset lights the evening sky to red. But rather than slowly ebbing away, its brightness gently intensifies then dims then intensifies again. From the glow, beams of light come slowly into being, reaching up into the darkness, straight as spears, before gently fading away again. Free-floating patches of light drift across the sky like summer clouds in a spellbinding display of the northern lights that lasts long into the night.</p>",
  "<p>Brussels police have swept the offices of two major public health organisations for bugs following a break-in at a building in the rue de Tr\u00e9ves in which laptops and documents relating to their battles against the tobacco industry were stolen.</p> <p>It is a convenient address for those involved in lobbying and monitoring the European political process, just five minutes walk from the Parliament building, and there are eight floors of well-equipped offices for burglars to investigate. But it appears they were interested only in those of the European Smoke Free Partnership and the European Public Health Alliance on the 5th and 1st floors. A third office \u2013 a company that has clients on the other side of the argument \u2013 was also entered, but nothing was taken.</p> <p>The burglars struck within 48 hours of the resignation of the European health commissioner, John Dalli. On Wednesday, he revealed that he had been forced out by commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso over a report by EU anti-fraud investigators accusing a fellow Maltese of attempting to sell influence over the commissioner to a Swedish tobacco company.</p> <p>Amid the confusion and the denials of wrongdoing on all sides, one thing looks certain \u2013 the tough new tobacco products directive that Dalli wanted to launch this autumn will not go ahead on schedule. It may even be stymied for this parliament and pushed back beyond the next elections \u2013 or be dead in the water.</p> <p>Anti-tobacco campaigners are convinced that they are looking at a dirty tricks campaign designed to strangle the new directive (TPD) at birth. But nobody beyond Barroso and a few others knows the strength of the evidence, because Olaf \u2013 the EU anti-fraud office \u2013 is refusing to release the report that led to Dalli's downfall. It is now being passed to the Maltese judiciary.</p> <p>In March, Silvio Zammit, a Maltese entrepreneur, circus owner and deputy mayor (until Thursday) of the small town of Sliema was in contact with Swedish Match, a tobacco company based in Stockholm. It makes snus, a moist tobacco product that is placed under the lip. It is illegal in the rest of the EU. The company \u2013 which is involved in a joint venture with tobacco giant Philip Morris to commercialise snus and other smoke-free tobacco products outside Scandinavia and the US \u2013 hoped to persuade the European commission that snus is healthier than cigarettes because it is not inhaled.</p> <p>Swedish Match complained to Olaf that Zammit had asked for a very large sum of money \u2013 how much, nobody is saying \u2013 to arrange a meeting with the health commissioner.</p> <p>No meeting took place and no money changed hands. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft8o6RWMKUE\" title=\"\">Dalli, in a videoed interview</a> with a Brussels political paper, said the investigators' report \"stated there was no proof at all that I was involved in any misdeed\" and that no decision of the commission had been jeopardised. But the report claimed there was \"some circumstantial evidence that I was aware of what was happening,\" said Dalli. \"This I refute completely.\"</p> <p>Swedish Match claims Zammit came to it. It told the Guardian that it hoped the events of recent days would not undermine the tobacco products directive, \"which we have eagerly anticipated for the past 12 years. Our hope and expectation is that this time snus will be judged on its own scientific merits, that it will receive a fair trial and that the processes followed by the commission in the review of the TPD will continue to be transparent and fair.\"</p> <p>But Dalli in his video read out an email which he said was from the company to Zammit, asking for an informal meeting with the commissioner in Brussels. It asked how much Zammit would charge.</p> <p>\"These people were offering to bribe Zammit to arrange a meeting with me,\" said Dalli. \"He never asked me for any meeting with these people.\"</p> <p>On his Facebook page, Zammit is equally robust: \"I categorically state that I have never received any payment from Swedish Match or Estoc (the European Smokeless Tobacco Council). My role was that of a lobbyist and all my contribution in the matter was above board and regular, in consonance with established practices. Furthermore, I confirm that I was contacted by the foreign party and it was them that set the ball rolling,\"he wrote. He adds that he has resigned as deputy mayor and as a member of the Sliema local council to fight to clear his name.</p> <p>Florence Berteletti Kemp, director of the European Smoke Free Partnership, \u2013 an alliance of the prominent health organisations Cancer Research UK, the European Respiratory Society and the European Heart Network \u2013 is at a disadvantage because she now has no computer. Whoever burgled the office took it, together with the computer of staff at the European Public Health Alliance who were also working on the tobacco legislation. \"They made it look very messy, so it looks ransacked, but they have taken specific things from specific persons,\" she said. Those things were related to the Dalli affair.</p> <p>\"What we are witnessing is the biggest tobacco industry interference in public health policy at the European level. The backdrop to the burglary at our office is the political scene. We believe that is no coincidence,\" she said.</p> <p>The new directive was intended to try to reduce the temptation for younger people \u2013 and particularly women \u2013 to start smoking, she said. Dalli said in his post-resignation interview that it would have imposed new restrictions on smokeless tobacco products and banned flavourings such as chocolate and strawberry. It would also have required graphic pictures of the damage smoking does on 75% of every packet.</p> <p>But it is now on ice. It should have gone to a consultation stage at the end of this month, but nothing will be done before a new health commissioner is appointed. That means there is unlikely to be time to get it through before new European parliament elections in 2014.</p> <p>\"This ambitious proposal on the side of public health to protect young people from beginning to smoke will not be continued,\" said Berteletti Kemp. \"It is a mess.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012 because the original said Swedish Match is part-owned by tobacco giant Philip Morris.</p>",
  "<p>Bob Dudley will recommend BP accept a cash and share deal worth more than $26bn (\u00a316bn) from Rosneft for its Russian business at a board meeting on Friday.</p> <p>The move would mean a partial retreat from the biggest oil and gas province in the world but could trigger a big payout to BP shareholders through a special dividend.</p> <p>It would also tie the British oil group into an embrace with the Kremlin as Rosneft is predominantly state-owned though some of its shares are listed. Dudley, the BP chief executive, held talks in London on Thursday with his Rosneft counterpart, Igor Sechin, after a formal offer from the Russians was received ahead of a 9am deadline.</p> <p>The exact details of the tie-up under which BP sells its 50% holding in its TNK-BP joint venture were still being worked on but it looks as if Dudley is willing to take a 15% share in Rosneft with the rest being handed over in cash.</p> <p>The BP board will consider the offer on Friday afternoon when Dudley will talk positively about the benefits. No detailed consideration has gone into how any Russian windfall \u2013 likely to be more than $15bn \u2013 will be used but a special dividend is one of the top options.</p> <p>Shareholders in BP have had a hard time since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the US Gulf in 2010 and the stock remains 30% lower than prior to the blowout.</p> <p>BP was not willing to comment on the bid. A spokesman for the British company would only say: \"We are considering our options including any offers we may have received.\"</p> <p>The purchase of the BP stake by Rosneft will make it the biggest publicly listed oil company in the world \u2013 above Exxon \u2013 if as expected it also buys the other 50% of TNK-BP from a consortium of local oligarchs known as AAR for a reported $28bn.</p> <p>But there are fears in Russia that a full takeover of TNK would strip the country's strategic oil sector of competition and efficiency. \"This is the restart of a process of re-nationalisation of the oil industry which was suspended several years ago,\" said Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister. Rosneft was a middling oil company until it swallowed the main assets of Yukos after the company was forced into bankruptcy following the jailing of its boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.</p> <p>\"This is a quite damaging for the situation in the oil industry. State domination has never brought about any positive results or major investment in the development of new greenfields, with a few exceptions, nor increasing the efficiency of the oil industry,\" he said. The deal would probably also add to Rosneft's heavy debt.</p> <p>\"It is very difficult to find economic advantages in the further monopolisation and renationalisation of the oil industry, which will again heavily leverage Rosneft,\" Milov said. \"That is not what Rosneft needs right now \u2013 what it needs is money to invest in new greenfields in the Arctic and elsewhere.\"</p> <p>Marat Atnashev, a vice-president at Evraz, a major metals holding, said the deal would bring positive results for those involved \u2013 BP, AAR and Rosneft. \"The only loser, surprisingly, seems to be the Russian economy,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"After the deal of the century is done, we will get another consolidated, practically monopolised industry,\" Atnashev wrote.</p> <p>Rosneft is keen not only to get control of production that accounted for almost a third of BP's total crude output and around 10% of its profits but also BP's technological expertise as it moves into drilling the Arctic. BP for its part is keen to exit a highly troubled TNK relationship with AAR but does not want to lose a foothold in such an important hydrocarbon province.</p> <p>There is particular interest in the Russian Arctic where the Kremlin and Rosneft are keen to explore and develop. But any involvement by BP in drilling the pristine waters of the Arctic would infuriate environmental campaigners following the Deepwater Horizon accident.Greenpeace recently took its first direct action against a Russian company \u2013 part of Gazprom \u2013 which was drilling in Arctic waters. BP signed an earlier Arctic exploration and share swap deal with Rosneft which fell apart because of opposition to it from its TNK-BP partners from AAR.</p> <p>Dudley used to be chief executive of TNK-BP but was removed from his job and had to leave Russia after a campaign against him, which commentators put down variously to AAR and even the Kremlin.</p> <p>BP claims it is not interested in the TNK sale to raise money for the Deepwater Horizon fund but to use the cash for other purposes.</p> <p>BP is still facing a claim of gross negligence from the Department of Justice in the US courts although the company is confident it can fight this off. BP has been selling assets all over the world to build a $30bn war chest to help pay off expected claims and liabilities resulting from the Gulf spill.</p>",
  "<p>Like many listeners, I'm loyal to aspects of some radio stations while giving others a wide berth. So Radio 3 is about speech output rather than music for me, and 5 Live is largely about news rather than sport beyond the big events (Olympics, Wimbledon) which the station covers in an inclusive, fun way.</p> <p>So it came as a surprise to find myself entranced by a two-hour 5 Live Sports Special on Monday night. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01ngqxd/5_live_Sport_Peddlers_Cyclings_Dirty_Truth/\" title=\"Peddlers  Cyclings Dirty Truth\"><strong>Peddlers \u2013 Cycling's Dirty Truth</strong></a>, presented by Mark Chapman, was a brilliant, comprehensive look at doping in the sport, full of memorable anecdotes and phrases, and featuring several jaw-dropping moments. Two things framed these throughout: a queasy sense of very warped morals in the sport (\"You've got to have the courage to dope\" one rider was told) and a pervasive casualness as riders and members of their teams revealed the extent of drug use. \"I did the interviews,\" Chapman said, \"and I'm shocked at how matter-of-fact it is.\" As one guest put it, \"it became a banality, like stealing pens from work\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tyler-hamilton\" title=\"Tyler Hamilton\">Tyler Hamilton</a>'s account was full of drama as it explained the moment a young cyclist has to decide whether to dope (\"You hit the fork in the road\"), and the first time illegal drugs enhance performance (\"It's like having a whole pot of coffee when you've never tasted coffee before\"). But it also featured day-to-day details about the secrecy (\"We called it Edgar Allan Poe\", he said of EPO), trying to avoid tests when drugged up and testers knock on your door (\"Get down on your hands and knees and crawl around\") and the dangers of blood transfusions (\"My&#xa0;urine was black, like a rusty&#xa0;colour\").</p> <p>The programme wasn't about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong\" title=\"Lance Armstrong\">Lance Armstrong</a>, per se, but was instead an exploration of the culture and context he rode in and dominated.

  "<p>Sit the rugby-mad mayor of Brussels down alongside Edward Griffiths, the travel junkie who is also chief executive of Saracens, and the outcome was always predictable, which is why the first Heineken Cup&#xa0;match in Belgium will be played on Saturday night.</p> <p>Sarcens versus Racing M\u00e9tro, the latest rich kids in French rugby, will be the London club's \"home\" leg, but played at the King Baudouin Stadium, formerly Heysel, largely, it seems, because of the mayor's enthusiasm and Saracens' seeming desire to see all corners of the globe.</p> <p>Under Griffiths, the squad have travelled to Munich, the home of both their sponsors Allianz and the Oktoberfest (twice), Cape Town (twice), Hong Kong, Miami, Abu Dhabi, Hamburg (for the David Haye fight) and Toulon. And if Brussels is less exotic than most of them, it will nevertheless become the 103rd venue in the 10th country to stage Europe's premier club tournament. It is certainly a different setting to Vicarage Road, where Saracens have had to continue playing in part at the start of this season.</p> <p>\"We found ourselves this season without a home stadium until February and didn't want to look at it as a negative but a positive whereby we could create some special events. Some one-off and unique events,\" said Griffiths . \"We looked at Cape Town and New York, but we also knew that three years ago Stade Fran\u00e7ais had intended to take a Heineken Cup match to Brussels.\"</p> <p>In fact Stade sold 30,000 tickets for that match against Ulster only for the game to be cancelled by heavy snow in the Belgian capital. Stade took such a hit that even their colourful owner, Max Guazzini, was never quite the same again.</p> <p>Guazzini later lost control of Stade, but Griffiths expects an altogether happier occasion. For a start, Saturday's weather forecast is good and 2,000 Saracens fans have signed up for a special deal which gives them return travel on Eurostar, plus seats on the halfway line.</p> <p>\"The mayor Freddy Thielemans [formerly a loosehead prop with a Belgian side called British Barbarians] was unbelievably enthusiastic from the beginning and the minister for the region of Brussels was equally enthusiastic, so, with the Saracens community team having been there three times for clinics with Belgian clubs, it seemed to us like a massive opportunity which snowballed when the draw was made and we had Racing M\u00e9tro as our opponents,\" said Griffiths.</p> <p>\"The Belgians had always said that the best crowd would be for an English team to play a French side. The French speakers would probably support the French team and everybody else would support any team that played against the French.\"</p> <p>In fact, between 18,000 and 20,000 tickets are expected to be sold. \"From a game that would have been a bit humdrum and a bit forgettable, we have created an event that hopefully people remember for a long time,\" Griffiths added.</p> <p>Whether the Saracens players agree that any Heineken Cup match could be described as \"humdrum\" is another matter, particularly as in this case, Racing are beginning to show unusual enthusiasm for the competition, beating Munster, twice the champions, in the opening round. However, there are signs that the much-travelled team will be spending more time at home in the near future.</p> <p>Griffiths says he has given up on taking Saracens' game against Munster in December to New York and thinks it highly unlikely that Edinburgh, who are also in their pool, will change their minds about an all-expenses-paid week in Cape Town. \"We would still like to take Edinburgh to Cape Town in January, but I don't think they are going to change their mind, which they are perfectly entitled to do,\" said Griffiths, who had agreed with Biarritz to play a Heineken Cup game in the South African city last season, only for the Western Province Union to refuse permission.</p> <p>\"Biarritz jumped at the chance and, as I've said before, rugby can't just do what it does and expect to grow. We have to be innovative, bold and dynamic.\"</p> <p>That said, once Saracens have moved into their new \u00a324m home \u2013 Allianz Park in north London, Griffiths does expect to make occasional visits to Wembley, Saracens' second home when they were based at Vicarage Road. \"Having put together a home stadium, we want to play in it,\" said Griffiths. \"Never say never, but the plan will be, from February, for all our competitive games to be played either at Allianz Park or Wembley.\"</p> <p>If Griffiths sticks to his word, Saracens will by then have played at 11 grounds in six months, with Racing yesterday naming Nantes and the 38,000-seater Stade de la Beaujoire, one of the 2007 World Cup venues, as their preferred option for the return leg in January. \"That must be a world record,\" said Griffiths.</p>",

A report from the Salvation Army released on Thursday said that of the 378 individuals it helped in 2011/12, 44% were trafficked for labour exploitation, 42% for sexual exploitation and one for the purposes of organ removal.</p> <p>According to the government study, 712 adult victims and 234 child victims were reported last year to the national referral mechanism, the body that identifies trafficking victims. Campaigners suggest the true figures could be significantly higher as many victims feared being deported if they tried to escape their situation.</p> <p>Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, accused the government of a series of policy failings that he said could lead to an increase in trafficking, including the removal of the right for migrant domestic workers to change employers and the failure to extend to remit of the gangmasters licensing authority.</p> <p>\"The fact that this issue continues to be seen through the prism of immigration means the decision on whether to protect a trafficked person is based more on their nationality rather than their right under the law to receive support,\" he said. \"It seems clear that until the government appoints a trafficking commissioner to co-ordinate its anti-trafficking obligations we will continue to see policy impeded by politics.\"</p> <p>According to the report, Nigerians were the largest group of potential trafficking victims, and Romanians the biggest group in Europe. It estimates there were 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, and 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011-12. It states that thousands of frontline workers including doctors, police, border staff and airline workers have been trained to better identify victims of trafficking in the past two years.</p> <p>At the safehouse, Mike described how he had been coerced into slavery after losing his job and becoming homeless. After sleeping rough on a beach for two weeks, a man approached him as he was making his way to a train station, offering him accommodation and work in exchange for \u00a320. His accommodation was a filthy hut on a caravan site to be shared with another man; his payment between \u00a35-10 a week for hard labour doing ground work seven days a week. \"I was just one of their tools, just a way to make them money,\" he said.</p> <p>He was hit once for bringing no work in on a particular day, and said other men were hit daily. He felt unable to leave because of the threat of violence. \"By the end I let go of all of my humanity and I just thought I deserved it,\" he said. \"The fear was that if I tried to leave I would be run over, hit by cars. In the end it seemed easier to stay than to go.\"</p> <p>When the site was raided by police who suspected men were being used as slaves, Mike did not believe his ordeal was over. But he accepted help and spent three months in a safehouse run by the Salvation Army, which runs 19 establishments across England and Wales after winning funding worth \u00a32m from the Home Office and Ministry of Justice last year.</p> <p>Mike hoped his story might encourage others to come forward and seek help. \"I want to get the message out there, I want people to realise that it does happen. People need to get out and seek help because there is help out there.\" He was looking forward to a brighter future. \"I am more positive, I just want a job, to work in an office,\" he said. \"I just want a normal life.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012. It quoted Helen Grant talking about the harvesting of sexual organs. She was referring to the harvesting of organs. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's way of running the country becomes ever more eccentric. This week he was like a dyspeptic columnist. On Wednesday he raged about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cameron-energy-department-explain-tariff?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">soaring energy prices</a>, leapt up in the House of Commons and said he would \"pass a law\" against them. That is the joy of being a Blairite prime minister. Margaret Thatcher would have spent hours fussing over how to do what she said. Cameron just blurts it out and leaves others to cope with the mess.</p> <p>All hell broke loose. The prime minister told the Commons he would legislate \"so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers\", not just the 25% who now opt for it. There were gasps all round. Whitehall officials had to burn the midnight oil \"clarifying\" what on earth the prime minister meant by thus denying choice. By morning a lexicographical genius decided that \"have to\" did not imply compulsion. A junior minister, John Hayes, said merely that \"a number of options are under consideration\", though by the day's end this was re-clarified as meaning a big stick.</p> <p>That is what happened a year ago, when Cameron did the same thing, summoning the energy bosses and telling them he was frightfully cross. They smiled, shook him by the hand and increased prices 13%, with a further 6-9% this year. Most of them are foreign-owned and really do not mind what a British prime minister says.</p> <p>Some might see this as rather humiliating, but Cameron is cut from original cloth. He does not rule but muses, suggests, stirs the pot; free of interfering staff work or research. Like Carroll's Queen of Hearts he reverses causality, with decision first, consultation afterwards. We have seen it over planning, health, airports, family taxes, forests, high-speed trains, Europe, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9362656/U-turns-make-even-David-Cameron-wonder-what-this-Government-is-for.html\" title=\"\">everything</a>. Each is followed by a review, a U-turn, a committee, perhaps a postponement until the next election. Hence his enthusiasm for that jewel of dilatory government, the independent inquiry.</p> <p>Cameron is right that months of hollering about utility prices and confused charging systems have yielded nothing but higher charges. Falling world gas and coal prices are not being reflected in falling domestic costs, but the reverse. Regulated privatisation has not worked. As far back as 1987 Thatcher's aide Ferdinand Mount remarked that \"the regulators have no teeth and the operators no conscience\". Eight years later, the then Ofgas regulator, Clare Spottiswoode, was accused of producer capture. She told parliament she was \"wholly unaccountable\" and her reports \"not worth the paper they are printed on\".</p> <p>Not much has changed, except that producer capture has got worse. Massive profits have brought foreign owners running. Coherent planning of long-term capacity has collapsed, victim of a not-so-civil war between government and the industry. On the one side are greedy but confused power companies, on the other ministers in thrall to lobbyists created by their own subsidies. The energy minister, Ed Davey, like his predecessor, Chris Huhne, seems at times to be reading out press releases from wind farm lobbyists, as do his colleagues on nuclear.</p> <p>There is no way privatisation can determine where energy should come from after most coal and nuclear power stations close over the next decade. Britain, unable to take important decisions because they require courage, is starting to resemble a third-world country, and facing eventual power cuts. Cameron's exasperation is understandable. Perhaps he should pass a law banning exasperation.</p> <p>This week, the Oxford professor of energy policy, Dieter Helm,<a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> publishes an attack on the whole vexed realm of carbon policy</a>. In The Carbon Crunch he does not quarrel with the statistical basis of climate change, only with its policy consequences. These he regards as driven by green faddishness into barking lunacy.</p> <p>Speaking at the Royal Society last week, Helm addressed two contrasting scenarios. If climate change is not urgent, then we can go on arguing, researching and building North Sea windmills and Saharan mirrors until the sacred cows come home. But if warming really is accelerating, and Helm accepts that it is, then there is no time to lose. There is certainly no time to mess about with footprints, windmills and air miles. A crisis is what it says.</p> <p>At present, rising world demand for energy is being met by coal. China, India, Germany, even Britain, are consuming ever more coal. China is building a coal power station every week. The one country not \"dashing for coal\" is the US, because it is dashing for gas, whose emissions per unit of energy are half those of coal. As a result, America's emissions and energy prices are falling compared with the rest of the world. It is the one virtuous player.</p> <p>To Helm, the answer is simple. The only short-term substitute for coal is not nuclear, which takes too long and is too expensive, but gas. Of course, gas is carbon, and we are still far from \"capturing\" its emissions. Of course, building gas stations may prejudice long-term investment in zero-carbon sources of power. Helm is messianic on researching such sources, be they sun, Earth, tide, even nuclear. But all that is over the horizon. Gas is in \"near limitless supply\" and for the world to turn against it merely prolongs dependence on coal and expedites climate change.</p> <p>Helm's other cause is not to attack production but to tax carbon consumption through a straight carbon tax. The money should go into research and carbon capture. It is also wrong to deny poorer consumers the benefit of cheap gas, as now, when we tax every energy bill to cross-subsidise the idling turbine parks of rich landowners. The green lobby \"has a lot to answer for\". At the Royal Society Helm came close to accusing it of driving forward climate change by ignoring gas.</p> <p>I am not qualified to know if Helm is right, but he writes with a convincing passion. He is also rumoured to have the ear of the Treasury, determined to press ahead with a new generation of gas power stations. Certainly Cameron on Wednesday sold an ideological pass. A Tory prime minister was meddling in the market for power to deny choice and fix prices. Will he extend this to petrol, air fares and bank charges? He also as good as admitted that the private sector can never sort out the energy mess. Having \"decided\" what to do on Wednesday, perhaps he can now decide what to do next.</p>",
  "<p>The former chief legal adviser to the army in Iraq has said the UK's complicity in the unlawful treatment of detainees was \"institutional\" and must be wiped out to prevent future abuses by British troops.</p> <p>Colonel Nicholas Mercer described how he was gagged by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after he criticised senior British commanders and MoD officials in the case of Baha Mousa, the Basra hotel worker was died in September 2003 while in the custody of British troops.</p> <p>Giving the annual Baha Mousa memorial lecture, Mercer said his attempts to set up independent judicial monitoring of the treatment of detainees were blocked by the MoD. Britain's obligations under domestic and international law were routinely ignored, he added.</p> <p>\"Apply the rule of law and this [abuse] will all go away, it is as simple as that\", Mercer said. He called on \"all public servants, lawyers, professional men and women\" to refuse to be part of \"this shameful conduct\" and end \"torture by the state\".</p> <p>Mercer, who is now a Church of England vicar, recalled how in May 2003 \u2013 four months before Mousa's death \u2013 he drew up an order, known as a 'Frago' in which he referred to \"a number of deaths\" of individuals in the custody of British soldiers. He stated: \"The detained person should be treated with humanity and dignity at all times. They should not be assaulted. They should be provided with water in all cases and food if they are detained for longer. If they need to be restrained then this should only be affected were absolutely necessary and using the minimum force required. Under no circumstances should their faces be covered as this might impair breathing. Medical assistance should be close to hand at all times.\"</p> <p>Mercer said no action was taken by UK commanders at the permanent joint headquarters in Northwood, north-west London, in response to his order.</p> <p>Mercer said that after he gave evidence to the Baha Mousa court martial (where one defendant, a corporal, pleaded guilty, while the others were acquitted for lack of available evidence), he was banned from speaking to any lawyer who was not in the army, and to journalists.</p> <p>Any speeches he made had to be \"checked and expurgated so a 'correct' version could be delivered\". He also said he was told by the MoD that he was \"not a suitable person\" to give lectures on how human rights bound troops on operations abroad.</p>",
  "<p>Original viewers of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cb3ik6zP2I\" title=\"The Shining\">The Shining</a> sat down to watch a psychological horror movie about a man who holes up inside a snowbound hotel, loses his marbles and tries to kill his family. Three decades later, the joke's on them; they read the whole thing wrong. The Shining is actually a Holocaust movie in disguise. Scratch that: The Shining is, in fact, Stanley Kubrick's version of Theseus and the labyrinth. No, wait: it's his veiled apology for helping Nasa fake the moon-landings, or a vast history lesson in human evil, from the dawn of man to the end of time. If there were ever a film to send the viewer mad, The Shining fits the bill.</p> <p>Director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038896/\" title=\"Rodney Ascher\">Rodney Ascher</a> estimates that he used only 10% of the interviews he conducted for Room 237, his riveting documentary on The Shining and its afterlife, presumably for fear of getting lost in the maze. But those that remain are creepy enough. Disembodied voices rear up on the soundtrack, each with their own pet theory, their own lurid conspiracy. These witnesses know Kubrick's film back to front, inside and out. They want to tell us about the \"secret window\" in Ullman's office, the significance of the number 42, and \"the mysterious Bill Watson\", a lowly hotel factotum who may just be CIA. After a while, most alarmingly of all, the voices start to make a kind of sense.</p> <p>Ascher cobbled Room 237 together on a thrift-shop budget, editing at home, at night, after he'd put the baby down to sleep. \"I cut the film between the hours of 8pm and 3am, and those hours are perfect for breeding a certain paranoia. I would listen to all these interpretations and think, 'Well yes, but no, but maybe.' It was like opening the book of Necronomicon or falling into quicksand.\"</p> <p>Judged purely on face value, The Shining was Kubrick's adaptation of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/14/stephenking.fiction\" title=\"Stephen King\">Stephen King</a> bestseller. It starred Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a struggling writer and reformed alcoholic who takes a job as winter caretaker at a haunted hotel. On its initial release, the film was widely seen to have fallen between two stools. The Shining was too arty for the horror fans and too trashy for the Kubrick buffs. Even King had his issues with the film. The novelist felt that Nicholson was too obviously demented as Torrance, that this hobbled the drama and that Jon Voight should have played the role instead. Room 237 shows him the error of his ways.</p> <p>It would be nice to dismiss Ascher's subjects as a gaggle of idiotic, excitable fan-boys with too much time on their hands. Annoyingly, the shoe won't quite fit. Geoffrey Cocks, who sees the film as a Holocaust parable, is professor of history at a Michigan college. Bill Blakemore, who decided that the film was about the genocide of the Native American, after spotting a carton of baking soda in the background, is a senior correspondent at ABC News. These people are educated, articulate and often plausible. Yet somehow The Shining has infected them. Compelling, claustrophobic and cross-referenced to within an inch of its life, Room 237 depicts Kubrick's film as a kind of cinematic petri dish. Conspiracy theories bloom like mushrooms in the dark.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">BFI</a> is releasing a restored, extended cut of The Shining, so I take myself to a preview screening. Rather worryingly, the film strikes me as somehow richer, stranger and more visceral than it did in the past. Part of this is the simple bonus of seeing it on a big screen. Part, I fear, is down to Room 237. Barely 10 minutes in I'm starting to understand where the theories are coming from, as little Danny (Danny Lloyd) pedals his bike past forbidden room 237 and the pristine ghost-girls invite him to \"come play with us for ever and ever\". The trouble with Kubrick's film is that it is so meticulously well composed. It has such ridiculous depth of focus. One has the sense that everything in these crowded frames (pictures on walls, cartons on shelves) is there for a reason, throbbing with significance. Watching The Shining is like scrutinising a painting by <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dadd-the-fairy-fellers-master-stroke-t00598\" title=\"\">Richard Dadd</a> or a malign version of <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-abxX7hiTS1c/Ttcqh2Ru8GI/AAAAAAAABAU/9AXX4OC96SE/s1600/Play+Wheres+Waldo+Online+Puzzle+Game+Beach.jpg\" title=\"\">Where's Waldo?</a> Stare too long and you lose the plot.</p> <p>But how many of these kinks have been put there intentionally? When a hack director makes a continuity error, it is taken as proof of incompetence. When a revered genius does the same, we wonder what they meant. The Shining comes riddled with bungled cuts and jarring locations. A chair vanishes from its place by the wall while a sticker disappears from a bedroom door. Midway through, the typewriter changes colour.</p> <p>Ascher speculates that Kubrick may have been having some fun, teasing his audience, though he concedes that some of the cuts may just be mistakes. He is particularly intrigued by the hotel carpet that reverses its pattern from one shot to the next. \"That's the trickiest one, because it means moving the camera's orientation from one end of the set to the other. That's a huge operation. It implies real intentionality.\"</p> <p>No doubt many of the more outlandish interpretations could be confirmed by simply speaking to those who worked on the film. Yet Ascher deliberately chose not to go down this route. He wanted to keep his focus on subjective responses as opposed to objective truth. \"In any case, even if you know the intention of the author, it doesn't necessarily make sense of it all.\" The unconscious, perhaps, is the great unsung hero in any work of art.</p> <p>Undeterred, I ring up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Harlan\" title=\"\">Jan Harlan</a>, Kubrick's brother-in-law and executive producer on The Shining. Harlan is happy to correct a few misconceptions. No, he tells me, the film is not an apology for faking the moon landings. That rumour was partly seeded by a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VWGeHqpmuc\" title=\"\">French TV documentary</a> that aired after the director's death in 1999 and appears to have been doing the rounds ever since. He says that he still sometimes receives outraged letters about it: \"How could Mr Kubrick have done such a thing?\". Harlan tuts in exasperation. \"He didn't, of course. But the story is still going on.\"</p> <p>Regarding the continuity errors, however, the jury is out. Kubrick, he explains, was always intent on pushing the form, on leaving the work open to multiple interpretations, like the French impressionists or the Cubist painters that went before. \"A straightforward horror film was not what interested him,\" Harlan insists. \"He wanted more ambiguity. If he was going to make a film about ghosts, he wanted it to be ghostly from the very first to the very last. The set was very deliberately built to be offbeat and off the track, so that the huge ballroom would never actually fit inside. The audience is deliberately made to not know where they're going. People say The Shining doesn't make sense. Well spotted! It's a ghost movie. It's not supposed to make sense.\"</p> <p>Whether this will provide comfort for Asher is anyone's guess. While assembling Room 237, the director found himself watching The Shining again and again, his brain whirring, his senses in uproar. Inevitably, he came away with a theory of his own. \"There's a scene in which Ullman says that Grady stacked the bodies in the west wing of the hotel,\" says Ascher. \"I thought, 'west wing'? That sounds like the White House. The Kennedy assassination. All of that.\" He's got to move on; he has to break free. I have a mental image of him still stuck inside that haunted hotel, still wandering the reverse patterns of the hallway carpet, in danger of playing for ever and ever.</p> <p>\u2022 Room 237 is out on 26 October; The Shining is reissued on 2 November.</p>",

  "<p>For all the control freakery, the money chasing, the internecine warfare between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones have always been the most open of groups \u2013 as Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant told the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/11/led-zeppelin-swagger-knew-were-good\" title=\"\">Guardian recently</a>: \"All you knew was that the Stones got all the press, and we sold a shitload of records.\"</p> <p>That leaves <a href=\"http://www.rollingstones.com/crossfire-hurricane\" title=\"\">Crossfire Hurricane</a>, the official documentary celebration of the Stones' 50th anniversary, with two problems. How do you retell a story that's been told so many times before? And how do you compete with the already extant films about the group \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM16EDpkF4\" title=\"\">Gimme Shelter</a>, the Maysles brothers' account of the 1969 US tour that ended with the disastrous Altamont concert; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6CWapkc9Lc\" title=\"\">Cocksucker Blues, </a>the rarely seen Robert Frank film that captured their 1972 tour, warts, needles, pills and all; and especially the peerless 25x5, the career-spanning biography first shown on BBC2 in 1989?</p> <p>Director Brett Morgen's answer is to try to show what it was like being a Stone, using the voices of the group \u2013 including those who have departed \u2013 as an unseen offstage chorus, commenting on the archive footage we are watching. So film of teenage girls invading stages in the mid-1960s is accompanied by a mordant Bill Wyman explaining how \"I could see the water flowing between the seats \u2026 it was a flood of urine.\" But he \u2013 and doubtless the band, given that Jagger is a producer and the other three are executive producers \u2013 care not for what it means to be a Rolling Stone now, when Richards can blithely announce that a payment of \u00a316m for four shows next month \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/16/keith-richards-glastonbury\" title=\"\">sounds about right</a>\".</p> <p>By showing us the group only as young men, the film invites us to buy into the myth of a band of brothers, fighting against the world. That it is a myth is revealed by Jagger, explaining how the group were positioned by Andrew Loog Oldham, their first manager, as the anti-Beatles, the darkness to the Liverpudlians' light, and how being bad then became a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the 1967 arrest of Jagger and Richards on drug charges.</p> <p>That \"cemented our relationship with the public,\" Jagger suggests, while Richards claims: \"They gave me a licence \u2026 That was when we really put the black hat on. Before that it was off-grey.\"</p> <p>Richards, always, is the romantic of the group, publicly at least; Jagger the realist. Hence, when the guitarist talks about fleeing England for fear of the law in the early 1970s, Jagger's voice quickly counters: \"Keith always says he was chased out of England by the cops. He may believe that but it's not actually true. The band left because of money.\"</p> <p>Crossfire Hurricane is at its strongest tracing the period of the band's greatness, from the mid-60s to the mid-70s. Footage from those other films is used judiciously, so one gets a sense of what the great travelling circus of the 1972 tour was like from excerpts from Cocksucker Blues, and just a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qTKsylrpsg\" title=\"\">few minutes of Gimme Shelter is necessary to paint Altamont</a> \u2013 at which 18-year-old Meredith Hunter was murdered by the Hells Angels hired to provide security \u2013 as a rock'n'roll update of Bruegel's The Triumph of Death.</p> <p>Oddly, for a film intended to mark 50 years of the group, Crossfire Hurricane treats the Stones' career as having to all intents and purposes ended as the 1970s drifted into the 80s. Richards' 1977 arrest for heroin possession in Toronto is the last significant event discussed, and the band members note how this was the period in which they went from being the group everyone hated to the one everyone loved. The last thing we see before the closing credits roll is aerial footage of the 1981 Still Life tour. In a way, it's entirely accurate: from this point, the Stones became little more than a money-making machine, dragged round the world every couple of years on the back of increasingly dismal albums.</p> <p>Now, there's no doubt if you want to make a film celebrating The World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band, cutting off 30 years ago is the right thing to do. Especially if they're the ones paying for it. But how much more fascinating Crossfire Hurricane might have been had it told the story of the years since, of Jagger and Richards at each other's throats, of the band trying and failing to once more rebottle the lightning of their first two decades, of how one's identity changes as one is redefined in the public mind from moral threat to national treasure.</p> <p>In its own way, Crossfire Hurricane is just like one of those Stones albums of the last three decades: it's fun, it has terrific moments, but in the end it pales in comparison with earlier triumphs.</p>",
  "<p>Twitter has blocked the account of a neo-Nazi group accused of inciting hatred towards foreigners.</p> <p>In what amounts to an unprecedented move for the company, Twitter announced it had complied with a request by German authorities who have been monitoring the activities of the banned far-right group Besseres Hannover (Better Hanover) for some time.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based company said it had used a device developed earlier this year to monitor content. \"We announced the ability to withhold content back in Jan,\" Twitter's lawyer, Alex Macgillivray, tweeted. \"We're using it now for the first time re: a group deemed illegal in Germany.\"</p> <p>The move came after an investigation into about 20 members of the neo-Nazi group in Lower Saxony, northern Germany, after they were charged with inciting racial hatred and forming a criminal organisation.

This was not surprising, as the Dutch star did play a character called Emmanuelle, with few variations, many times over.</p> <p>In the original film, Kristel portrayed the bored wife of a French embassy official in Bangkok, urged by her libertine husband to explore all the possibilities of sex. Thereupon, she finds herself in bed with, among others, a lesbian archaeologist and an elderly rou\u00e9. Directed with some grace by Just Jaeckin, this glossy soft-porn package, dressed up as art-house erotica, was a huge international hit, becoming the first X-rated film to be released in the US. Lushly photographed and with a&#xa0;certain level of character development, its appeal went beyond the raincoat brigade. The success was also put down to Kristel's underestimated performance.</p> <p>According to the critic Roger Ebert: \"She projects a certain vulnerability that makes several of the scenes work. The performers in most skin-flicks seem so impervious to ordinary mortal failings, so blas\u00e9 in the face of the most outrageous sexual invention, that finally they just become cartoon characters. Kristel actually seems to be present in the film, and as absorbed in its revelations as we are.\" Her performances in several other films, with directors including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/23/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Walerian Borowczyk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/12/claude-chabrol-obituary\" title=\"\">Claude Chabrol</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/12/guardianobituaries.timpulleine\" title=\"\">Roger Vadim</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/19/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Alain Robbe-Grillet</a>, proved that she was worthy of&#xa0;better than most of the quickie tosh in&#xa0;which she appeared.</p> <p>She was born in Utrecht, Netherlands, where her parents ran a hotel. In her 2006 autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/22/biography.features1\" title=\"\">Undressing Emmanuelle</a>, she recalls how she was sexually abused aged nine by an elderly guest at the hotel. Her alcoholic parents divorced when she was 14 after her father left home for another woman. Two years later, he returned with the woman, kicking his wife, Sylvia and her sister out of the house.</p> <p>After a convent school education, Kristel became a photographic model, with a lack of inhibition that landed her role in Emmanuelle \u2013 soon followed by Emmanuelle 2 (1975), in which the scene has shifted to Hong Kong, though this is&#xa0;hardly noticeable, because most of the action is in soft-focus close-ups. Kristel again disrobes elegantly and supplies the endless round of sexual encounters with a modicum of tasteful eroticism.</p> <p>The last of the trilogy, set in the Seychelles, was mistitled Goodbye Emmanuelle (1977), because Kristel would appear again in two more features and seven TV films as the older Emmanuelle, usually instructing a&#xa0;younger version of herself in the art of&#xa0;seduction. In between, her reputation was being exploited by the eccentric French director Jean-Pierre Mocky, who got her to swim naked in No Pockets in a Shroud (1974), and she played a&#xa0;prostitute in Robbe-Grillet's Playing with Fire (1975). In Vadim's A Faithful Wife (Une Femme Fid\u00e8le, 1976), set during the 19th century, Kristel was allowed to keep her beautiful costumes on most of the time.</p> <p>Her favourite film was Borowczyk's The Streetwalker (La Marge, 1976), in&#xa0;which she is touching as a mysterious and proud prostitute who has an affair with a happily married man (Joe Dallesandro). Alice or the Last Escapade (Alice ou la Derni\u00e8re Fugue, 1977) was a surprising departure into fantasy for Chabrol. In this homage to Lewis Carroll and \"old dark house\" movies, Kristel does her best with the passive character.</p> <p>As Maria Theresa, Kristel led a cast that included Ursula Andress, Cornel Wilde, Beau Bridges, Rex Harrison and Olivia de Havilland in The Fifth Musketeer (1979). During the shooting, Kristel and Ian McShane, who played the wily minister Fouquet, began a&#xa0;highly publicised, five-year-long affair.</p> <p>It was among the few mainstream movies that Kristel made, another being The Concorde... Airport '79 (1979) in&#xa0;which she is a flight attendant who says to the captain (George Kennedy): \"You pilots are such... men,\" only to receive the reply: \"They don't call it the&#xa0;cockpit for nothing, honey.\"</p> <p>She was soon back to roles that were expected of her, such as a soft-porn version of Lady Chatterley's Lover (1981), for which she was reunited with Jaeckin. In Private Lessons (1981), an&#xa0;American film set in Arizona, she is a maid who sexually initiates a teenage boy. (She had a stand-in for the sex scenes.) It was a box-office smash, but Kristel got no share in the profits as she had unwisely sold her share in the production prior to its release. A success with the teen crowd was the broad US high-school farce Private School (1983), in which Kristel plays a sex education teacher called Ms&#xa0;Regina Copoletta, an example of the level of its humour.</p> <p>In 1985 Kristel had the impossible task of competing with Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Jeanne Moreau as&#xa0;Mata Hari, revealing much more than they did. Although she continued to be active, she was by then struggling with drugs and alcohol. A heavy smoker from&#xa0;the age of 11, she was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2001, and then lung cancer.</p> <p>She survived to work again, directing a short animated film, Topor and Me (2004), which won an award at the Tribeca film festival in 2006. Two years ago, I attended the Pula festival in Croatia where she was invited for the showing of Two Sunny Days, a Croatian film in English, directed by Ognjen Svilicic, in which she appeared in a small but important role. I had the pleasure of sharing a car with her on a two-hour drive to Zagreb, during which she chatted cheerfully about her career.</p> <p>Kristel was married and divorced twice. She is survived by her partner, Peter Brul, and a son by the Belgian author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/02/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Hugo Claus</a>, a partner from the mid-1970s.</p> <p>\u2022 Sylvia Kristel, actor, born 28 September 1952; died 18 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>It is hard to imagine either Joe Root or Nick Compton hanging out the bunting and turning cartwheels of delight but strictly in cricketing terms the return of Kevin Pietersen to the England squad cannot be anything other than a good thing.</p> <p>There is likely to be a sigh of relief, too, in the offices of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, whose promotional campaign for the four-Test series can only benefit from the presence of one of the most marketable figures in the game. Whatever anyone feels about Pietersen, there is no denying that his charisma as a player sells tickets.</p> <p>There are sure to be some very careful footsteps over the eggshells in the coming weeks, however. The supposed period of \"reintegration\", unless it is regarded as an ongoing process to be continued through the tour, as if he has just been released on probation, does rather seem to have consisted of little more than another face-to-face meeting between Pietersen and England management and some senior players, at which there cannot have been very much more to add to what has been said.</p> <p>Words are easy in any case, and none of it will be worth anything until the proof is there. A sort of peace may have descended, and players in particular can be quick to forget animosity in pursuit of common purpose, but it will be an uneasy one for a while yet.</p> <p>There is no question, though, that Pietersen's every move in the team dynamic will be under scrutiny from within and the periphery. As far as the media, in all its forms, is concerned, 'KP Watch' will dominate the warm-up matches and probably the first Test in Ahmedabad, to such an extent that Kate Humble should be drafted in to coordinate.</p> <p>Would there be a great show of team unity should Pietersen make a hundred, or take some wickets as he did in his last Test? Is there jocularity rather than frostiness during practice sessions? The team director will more than earn his corn. Andy Flower has been remarkable in his unflappable patience not just in the past few months but in the three or more years that he has managed the egos not just of Pietersen, but of others in the team.</p> <p>This whole business must have worn to a frazzle even as resilient an individual as Flower, who given that Pietersen was keen that he lost his job alongside his predecessor Peter Moores, might be forgiven had he harboured enmity but if he has, he has kept it hidden and handled himself with dignity. Now it is down to him and Alastair Cook, as an ambitious new captain, to ensure that a valuable asset is absorbed back into the team to the greatest effect and least distraction, while mindful that there can surely be no copper-bottomed guarantee that such a situation will not arise again.</p> <p>There are those who would regard the return of Pietersen as no more than an expedient measure for England, a swallowing of pride with someone answering a call in their hour of need. They could not be more wrong. If there have been mistakes on both sides, as Flower has admitted \u2013 and it really should not have been allowed to drag on as long as it did, fuelled by the added distraction of the text message fiasco \u2013 then the root cause of the whole affair has lain with Pietersen. His contrition has been fundamental, an absolute basic, for Flower to contemplate having him back in the side.</p> <p>Of course the team look stronger. Without him there was always going to be not just new faces, but juggling of the order. Now that he seems certain to be back in his position at No4 the permutations are several, the only direct replacement necessary being that for Andrew Strauss at the top of the order.</p> <p>Until Pietersen's return there was no doubt that either Root or Compton would open and when Ian Bell returns home around the time of the second Test to attend the birth of his first child, perhaps both would have played. Now, should Jonathan Trott move up the order to open \u2013 not outside the realms of possibility \u2013 neither might appear in the first Test, with Eoin Morgan a possible No5 and Samit Patel, one of the better readers and players of spin in the team, at No6 irrespective of whether his left-arm spin is viewed as a valuable commodity.</p>",
  "<p>Kim Jong-il's grandson has described his uncle, North Korea's new leader Kim Jong-un, as a dictator, <a href=\"http://arenan.yle.fi/tv/1662407\">in a rare television interview</a>.</p> <p>Kim Han-sol discussed his friendships with South Koreans and hopes for reunification. The confident, articulate teenager \u2013 who sported black framed glasses and two earrings in his left ear \u2013 has been studying in Bosnia since last year.</p> <p>He is the child of Kim Jong-il's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, who reportedly fell from favour with his father when he was caught attempting to enter Japan using a fake passport in 2001 and who has lived in Macau for several years.</p> <p>Earlier this year Kim Jong-nam predicted that the new regime would not last long, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/north-korea-leader-not-long\" title=\"\">according to a Japanese journalist</a>. But his son's interview is surprising because it remains extremely rare for members or relatives of the North Korean elite to comment on the country and its leadership, still less be filmed.</p> <p>Asked why his uncle was appointed as leader, the 17-year-old replied: \"My dad was definitely not really interested in politics. I really don't know how he [Kim Jong-un] became a dictator ... It was between him and my grandfather.\"</p> <p>Asked if he hoped to have an influence on North Korea one day, he added: \"I have always dreamed one day I will go back and make things better \u2013 make it easier for all the people there. I also dream of reunification because it's really sad that I can't go to the other side [South Korea] and see my friends there.\"</p> <p>The student said he was born in Pyongyang and moved to Macau a few years later, returning to North Korea every summer to see relatives, but spending most of his time with his mother's family, who were ordinary citizens. He described a \"very isolated\" childhood where the family kept a low profile, but added: \"I really didn't know until later on that my grandfather was a leader in Korea.</p> <p>\"Little by little, through conversations my parents had, I started to put the puzzle pieces together and then I realised who he was.\"</p> <p>The teenager said he had never met Kim Jong-il, who died late last year. \"I was actually waiting for him, hoping he would come to find me ... I was really curious to meet my grandfather and know what he was like as a person,\" he said. He added: \"I saw both levels, in the family of a dictator, and at the same time living with ordinary citizens, and I have learned quite a lot that way.</p> <p>\"My mum always encouraged me to live the same lifestyle as an ordinary citizen so I could have a better understanding of the people.\" His father also told him to \"forget about your background and live your life\" and be grateful for what he had, he added.</p> <p>The student described how he had made good friends with Americans and South Koreans while at school, despite the tensions between his country and theirs. While it was awkward when he first met his South Korean friends \"little by little we started to understand each other ... and sometimes we share stories from back home and realise how similar we are: the same language, the same culture \u2013 it really is just political issues that divide the nation in half.\"</p> <p>He also revealed he has a Libyan roommate who had enthusiastically supported the revolution. The interview was conducted in English for a Finnish television channel by Elisabeth Rehn, former under secretary general at the United Nations, and uploaded on YouTube.</p>",
  "<p>France and Germany were locked in their worst showdown of the three-year euro crisis on Thursday evening, split between two conflicting approaches, with Berlin leading the charge for draconian new centralised powers over national budgets and Paris spearheading a campaign for quicker and easier bailouts of struggling countries and banks.</p> <p>French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, appearing at only his third EU summit in Brussels after having thrown down the gauntlet to Angela Merkel this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/francois-hollande-interview-eu-france?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Guardian</a> and other European newspapers, flatly dismissed German demands for a new European \"budgets tsar\" who would be able to overrule national governments and parliaments on tax-and-spend policies in the eurozone.</p> <p>\"The topic of this summit is not the fiscal union but the banking union, so the only decision that will be taken is to set up a banking union by the end of the year and especially the banking supervision,\" Hollande said. \"Merkel has her own deadline, in September 2013,\" he added caustically, referring to next year's general election in which the German leader is seeking a third term.</p> <p>The two leaders met before the summit began on Thursday to try to iron out their differences. They were seen walking together grim-faced into the summit room, with Hollande speaking to Merkel and the chancellor appearing to say 'no' three times.</p> <p>The summit sought to come up with an agreement on putting the European Central Bank in charge of supervising the eurozone banking sector by the start of next year, Hollande's key demand.</p> <p>Germany, which is dragging its feet on the banking supervisor despite having proposed the move in June, revived calls for an independent European budgets tsar based at the European Commission who would enjoy sweeping powers of enforcing fiscal rectitude by overruling national governments' and parliaments' budgetary policies.</p> <p>\"We are of the opinion, and I speak for the whole German government on this, that we could go a step further by giving Europe real rights of intervention in national budgets,\" Merkel told parliament in Berlin before arriving in Brussels.</p> <p>The draft summit conclusions stipulated the aim of launching the banking supervisor in January next year, but Merkel was said to be trying to get that deadline altered or removed. \"Quality must come before speed,\" she said. \"There are a lot of very complicated legal questions.\"</p> <p>Senior diplomats described the stand-off between France and Germany as substantive, but also entailing \"a lot of smoke and mirrors\", with both sides engaged in setting out strong positions before having to climb down at a later stage.</p> <p>In the Guardian interview this week Hollande lambasted Merkel's crisis management over the past 30 months, arguing that the German fixation on austerity and debt reduction was making matters worse in the eurozone by triggering recession.</p> <p>He is known to believe that Merkel is not listening to him, nor to the leaders of Spain or Italy. His clarion call is the need for greater \"solidarity\" in the eurozone.</p> <p>\"The Germans are telling the others that if you want solidarity, then this is the price you have to pay, we take control of your budget through a super-commissioner,\" said a senior EU diplomat. \"The Germans are playing hardball. But the French and the Germans will have to do a deal. And they always do. Otherwise [the euro] collapses.\"</p> <p>No breakthrough or deal was expected at the summit, though, because the leaders feel that the pressure from the financial markets on the euro and on borrowing costs for countries like Spain and Italy has lifted.</p> <p>Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president chairing the summit, hoped to finesse an overall agreement on the banking supervisor. But the new system is highly technical and complex. Even if the leaders reached an outline deal on the project, it will take months at least to iron out the detail, making it unlikely that the regime will be up and running by January as planned.</p> <p>The summit also \"explored\" two new proposals from Van Rompuy aimed at stabilising the euro \u2014 a system of annual \"contracts\" struck between eurozone governments and the European Commission committing governments to reforms of their labour markets and other structural changes, as well as the establishment of a new eurozone \"budget\" that would be used to cushion the impact of the structural reforms and also as a redistribution mechanism within the single currency area.</p> <p>The eurozone budget idea is contested, albeit still vague. The notion originates from Berlin which sees it as a way to deflect pressure for a more comprehensive system of \"eurobonds\", pooling the debt of the eurozone countries.</p> <p>Despite conflicting pressures on Spain over whether to request a bailout, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has an election in his native area of Galicia on Sunday, was not expected to ask for help. Behind the scenes the French-led camp is urging him to take a bailout, while the Germans are pushing him to resist because Merkel hopes to avoid taking the request to her parliament less than a year before seeking re-election.</p> <p>Hollande is also insisting that the eurozone spell out the terms involved in a Spanish bailout before any request is tabled, while the Germans stick to the line that the request must come first and then the conditions negotiated.</p> <p>Diplomats expect Spain to ask for a rescue before the end of the year and predict that the negotiations over it will be the toughest by far in the three-year euro and sovereign debt crisis.</p>",
  "<p>A jury has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/17/mark-duggan-gun-no-verdict?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">failed to reach a verdict on Kevin Hutchinson Foster</a>, who was charged with supplying a gun to Mark Duggan on the day he was shot and killed by armed Met officers. Hutchinson Foster had pleaded not guilty, although he did admit using the same weapon to pistol whip another man just a week before Duggan's death.</p> <p>Given the media's coverage of the case, though, one could be forgiven for believing it was Duggan himself who has been on trial these past three weeks, with his photograph emblazoned prominently alongside every report.</p> <p>As a result the Duggan family had to endure calls from friends who believed that Mark's inquest had already begun, which was not surprising as the prosecution made sure that it provided the media with copies of its 25-page opening statement. This statement mentioned Duggan, who wasn't on trial, more often than the accused, Hutchinson Foster.</p> <p>So, it's really not a surprise that this trial was being used as a proxy for the official inquest into his killing; it gave the police an opportunity to air their version of events \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9568304/Mark-Duggan-shooting-police-marksman-100-per-cent-sure-victim-had-gun.html\" title=\"\">including the hugely controversial claim that Duggan was pointing a gun at them</a> \u2013 without fear of rigorous cross-examination by the appropriate investigators or the Duggan family's legal representatives.</p> <p>I cannot understand why there was such a focus on what happened after the gun was allegedly transferred from Hutchinson Foster to Duggan in this case. This is obviously hugely helpful to the police, who want the public to believe they acted appropriately in killing Duggan, and that there were no reasonable grounds for the explosion of anger on the streets of Tottenham two days later.</p> <p>There was little, or no, reporting on the fact that a week earlier, on 29 July, the police had been told that Hutchinson Foster had used the gun to assault Peter Osadebay in broad daylight just up the road in Dalston. Why were there no headlines regarding this issue? Had the Met done its job and properly investigated this incident, perhaps no one outside of Tottenham would even know the name of Mark Duggan today.</p> <p>I also understand that the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is investigating the Duggan killing, has been prevented by the Crown Prosecution Service from disclosing information to the family about allegations made against Duggan during the trial. Clearly, the reporting of the Hutchinson Foster case has undermined the IPCC investigation because police evidence about the shooting has been publicly aired as fact before it could test its veracity.</p> <p>Duggan's mother and family were forced to witness the unfolding story of the last hours of his life and his alleged lifestyle via the media \u2013 in much the same way that they were forced to learn about his death. They will have to endure this again at the retrial.</p> <p>Yet they remain confident that, at an inquest with proper representation, many of the vivid and emotive headlines, such as those claiming that Duggan was armed at the time that he was shot, will be challenged and ultimately disproved \u2013 in the same way the Met's initial claim that Duggan started a shoot-out and had shot a police officer was proven to be totally false.</p> <p>Many local people believe that, while Hutchinson Foster has been prosecuted, Duggan has been persecuted, and for reasons that have little to do with justice. The youths of Tottenham have certainly not been swayed by the events in Snaresbrook crown court. Most believe Duggan was unlawfully killed and that the police and other agencies are working together to cover up their mishandling of the situation. One witness to appear before the court testified that she saw a police officer coming out of Duggan's minicab with the alleged gun in hand minutes after the shooting. Of course, the media mostly failed to report these claims; but they have not been missed, or dismissed, by Duggan's friends and family quite so easily.</p>",
  "<p>The Mauritanian government stands accused of a cover-up as further claims emerge of events surrounding the shooting of the president, with growing allegations of an attempted coup.</p> <p>Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was rushed to hospital last weekend after having been shot in the stomach by military guards, apparently by accident, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/14/mauritanian-president-shot-by-mistake\" title=\"\">after passing through a checkpoint</a> 25 miles from the capital, Nouakchott, following a trip into the desert.</p> <p>A source told the Guardian that Basep, the controversial and powerful presidential guard, also ferried a number of unidentified injured people and dead bodies to the same military hospital.</p> <p>The source, who asked not to be identified, said explanations for the casualties do not tally with the government account. \"The number of dead and injured cannot be explained,\" the source said.</p> <p>The claims could further fuel speculation that the shooting was a failed coup attempt.

  "<p>The president, Hamid Karzai, has said he will not accept foreigners on a key election watchdog, a move that risks undermining the credibility of a presidential poll in 2014.</p> <p>Karzai also said Afghans would not be willing to grant foreign troops immunity from prosecution while the country was at war, a position that could jeopardise plans for a long-term foreign military presence in the country.</p> <p>\"The presence of foreigners in the Electoral Complaints Commission [ECC] is against the sovereignty of Afghanistan,\" Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul with the visiting Nato chief, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, according to Reuters.</p> <p>The 2014 election coincides with the departure of Nato-led troops from Afghanistan, and is expected to lay the foundation for the country's future without the coalition or Karzai, who has ruled for a decade and cannot stand for the top office again under Afghan law.</p> <p>There are already concerns about the potential for fraud, after widespread corruption marred votes in 2009 and 2010. Rights groups warned that the ECC would be weakened by the loss of members best able to ignore internal political pressure.</p> <p>\"In the 2009-2010 elections the ECC was the only entity that was involved in the whole process who came out looking good \u2026 and that seemed to be due in no small part to the fact that they had internationals involved who didn't have a dog in the fight,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch. \"So it's really concerning to see that particular institution changed and possibly made less immune to external influence in the runup to what is going to be a very critical election.\"</p> <p>Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi said foreigners were still welcome as election monitors, but that the Afghan government was able to ensure the poll was fair.</p> <p>Rasmussen and Karzai also discussed a role for foreign troops after 2014. \"This will not be a combat mission. It will focus on training, advice and assistance. And we are actively planning for that mission\", Rasmussen said.</p> <p>The US and Afghanistan are involved in sensitive negotiations about the shape of a long-term military presence, expected to lay the groundwork for similar deals with other Nato countries. The most challenging detail is expected to be the legal status of US forces; the Iraqi government's refusal to grant immunity precipitated the final pullout of US troops there last year.

  "<p>From the moment <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149147/dredd\" title=\"\">Dredd</a> gets dispatched to clean up a futuristic mess in a dystopian-era society where things are not running smoothly, until the moment the futuristic mess is cleaned up, leading man Karl Urban never takes off his helmet. Not even to rub some perspiration off his sweaty brow. All you see throughout the film is the lower portion of his face. It makes him look like a grizzled, dystopian-era Roman centurion. Meanwhile, his sidekick, trainee judge Cassandra Anderson, played by Olivia Thirlby, never bothers to don a helmet, partly because it would interfere with the brainwaves she needs to read in her capacity as a psychic law-enforcement officer, but mostly because she is lovely, which Karl Urban is not.</p> <p>None of this would be worth mentioning, except that Tom Hardy wears a stupid gas mask the entire time he's playing the villain in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, so we never get to see his face either. This may be because Batman's classy, world-famous mask would completely upstage anything Bane might slap on to his quasi-anarchist, neo-fascist, Occupy Gotham puss; or it might be because he really does have serious breathing issues. Either way, we never see his entire face. Which is a little bit annoying.</p> <p>This, too, might not be worth mentioning, except that in the time-travel thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148727/looper\" title=\"\">Looper</a>, criminals from the dystopian future are sent back to the dystopian past to be gunned down on arrival by freelance executioners. Sometimes the criminals are being killed by younger versions of themselves, a number of whom have only become assassins so they can raise money to go to France. The doomed men always wear hoods over their faces, which makes killing them easier. But the doomed men are also shrouded in hoods because the powers that be in the dark dystopian future worry that the executioner might recognise the condemned man as a future version of himself \u2013 30 years older, but not much wiser \u2013 and then mess things up by getting killed, allowing his future manifestation to take it on the dystopian, futuristic lam. But at a crucial juncture, due to easily avoidable procedural problems, Bruce Willis arrives in the present with his hood undone, allowing Joseph Gordon-Levitt to see himself 30 years hence. How he recognises himself is beyond me; Willis is an ornery stud, Gordon-Levitt a bit of a dweeb. But he does. And after that, all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>I, for one, would argue that wearing a mask or hood or bizarre breathing apparatus over your face in a film is not a good idea if you are not yet a famous star, because it vastly reduces your facial-recognition quotient. It's OK for Willis to do this, because Willis has already made 400 movies. But did the guys in the scary masks in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/66977/scream\" title=\"\">Scream</a> films ever break through to the big time? Who was that playing Michael in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/104810/halloween\" title=\"\">Halloween</a> movies? A bunch of guys, it turns out. Who was that hiding behind Jason's mask in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78528/friday-the-13th\" title=\"\">Friday the 13th</a> series? A bunch of guys, it turns out, none of them household names, unless you live in a household that keeps close tabs on Kane Hodder's career. David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36316/star.wars\" title=\"\">Star Wars</a>, never became intergalactically famous, and the mask/helmet may have had something to do with it: even though everyone knows that only Vader's voice, and not his body, was that of James Earl Jones, people still tend to think of Darth Vader as James Earl Jones, not Whatshisname. Anyway, there was another guy standing in for Prowse during the epic lightsaber tussles with Luke Skywalker. For all I know, it may have been Kane Hodder.</p> <p>I'm not sure what the current trend in concealing faces behind masks and hoods and jerry-rigged respiratory devices says about movies. But I wish they'd do more of it. It would prolong a lot of actor's careers if we didn't see their faces anymore; they could keep on playing dashing hearthtrobs well into their 80s. It would also mean that actresses could nix all those scary facelifts and chin jobs the industry forces on them. And it would mean that Woody Allen could go back to making movies where he hits on co-stars half his age without anybody complaining about the January-December thing.</p> <p>Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all.</p>",
  "<p>A millionaire businessman who bankrolled the British National party has addressed a protest rally at the opening of the first private abortion clinic on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Jim Dowson, a one-time associate and fundraiser for the BNP leader, Nick Griffin, joined anti-abortion groups from Dublin and Catholic west Belfast as well as Free Presbyterians in a demonstration outside the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast.</p> <p>He told several hundred activistsit was \"good to see an issue that united Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland\".</p> <p>Dowson was forced out of his local Orange Lodge in Scotland and took part in demonstrations against fellow Orangemen, attacking them as \"atheists and boozers\", after he became \"born again\". He has fallen out with the BNP leader and his party.</p> <p>The protesters also included the Rev David McIlveen, of Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian church, and Catholic priests. The clinic will provide non-surgical, medical abortions for women who are up to nine weeks pregnant.</p> <p>In pouring rain, Catholic demonstrators sang hymns such as Ave Maria and recited the Rosary while Protestants waved posters urging the passing public to \"Seek Ye the Lord\".</p> <p>The protesters occupied both sides of Great Victoria Street, with a smaller group huddling in the covered entrance to the opera house. Beneath an advertising hoarding for the racy musical Chicago, they marked the tolling of a bell at noon with a solemn recitation of the Angelus prayer.</p> <p>Afterwards both sets of demonstrators clapped and cheered when Bernadette Smyth, spokeswoman for the pressure group Precious Life, predicted their campaign would \"run Marie Stopes out of Ireland\".</p> <p>A white van with a billboard on the roof declaring \"Abortion is murder\" drove up and down Great Victoria Street sounding its horn. Its registration \u2013 Co Monaghan in the Republic \u2013 indicated that the campaign against the clinic spanned the border as well as the north's divide.</p> <p>The demonstrators cheered by news that Northern Ireland's attorney general, John Larkin QC, had called for a special Stormont investigation into the legality of the clinic's opening. Larkin said he could not intervene but would be happy to give advice to the power-sharing government.</p> <p>It emerged that the clinic's management would be summoned to Stormont to explain how they are complying with the law. Alban Maginness, of the SDLP, said during a meeting of the justice committee: \"What worries me in relation to Marie Stopes is that this clinic is outside the National Health Service. It does not appear to be regulated.</p> <p>\"Given the contentious nature of their support for abortion it is necessary that the law is fully complied with and that we are assured by Marie Stopes. I think this is an important task for this committee and I hope that Marie Stopes organisation will respond positively to any invitation so then we can inquire from them what their position is within the law.\"</p> <p>Jim Wells, of the DUP, who also sits on the Stormont health committee, said the issue of abortion had now become a legal question. He said: \"There is a huge public interest on this subject. It only appropriate to examine it. The public expect us to do something.\"</p> <p>Outside the clinic, Ciara Coyle, who had travelled from Derry to Belfast to join the protest, said she believed abortion was wrong \"no matter what the circumstances are\". Asked how she and other activists could prevent the clinic from operating, Coyle replied: \"Unfortunately all we can do is pray, to pray and to protest peacefully. To be in the streets. I just can't understand why our politicians and the likes of the health minister can't stop this already.\"</p> <p>She denied that there was a demand among women in Northern Ireland for abortion services. \"I do believe that Northern Ireland is a pro-life country, like the whole of Ireland, and we will continue to make our stand,\" she said.</p> <p>Most pro-choice campaigners in Belfast chose to avoid confrontation and stayed away, but one woman stood demonstrating her support for the clinic. Danni Stanfield, 21, a student from Belfast, said: \"Many of the people here today who are pro-life, if they were in that situation themselves they might take a different point of view.</p> <p>\"I don't think many here today have come from the background where they have gone through abortions themselves. I am pro-choice but I had to come here and support the clinic. I am not saying to women who get pregnant unplanned should have an abortion but rather that they be allowed that choice.\"</p> <p>Defying attempts to shout her down, Stanfield held aloft a homemade placard with a question on it for those who want no abortion in any circumstances anywhere in Ireland: \"Been in the situation? Only then does your opinion count.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for Marie Stopes said that since opening the clinic's doors they had been inundated with queries about their services in Belfast.</p> <h2>Abortion law</h2> <p>Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply. It still uses the 1861 Act banning abortion as an offence against the person. However, up to 40 medical terminations are carried out in Northern Ireland hospitals each year, covered by post-war legislation that allows for abortions only when the life of the mother is at risk. Up to 1,000 women are estimated to leave the province every year to have terminations in Britain and Europe.</p> <p>In the Irish Republic there is an absolute ban on abortion. Even in the cases where babies would die at birth, women have the choice of either going through the full nine months of pregnancy or travelling out of the state to have an abortion. A referendum in 1983 determined that an unborn child is technically an Irish citizen with the full protection in rights contained in the Irish constitution.</p> <p>The Fine Gael-Labour coalition government in Dublin has been forced to return to the abortion question after the European court of human rights ruled that the rights of a woman known as Cwere violated because she could not obtain a termination in the state even though she was suffering at the time from ovarian cancer. The coalition is preparing a paper on abortion reform but the Catholic church and radical anti-abortion groups such as Youth Defence have warned of an autumn offensive aimed at pressurising the senior coalition partner, Fine Gael, not to renege on its promise to keep the ban.</p>",

  "<p>Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-aligned group part-funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, is building a state-of-the-art digital ground operation in Ohio and other vital battleground states to spread its anti-Obama message to voters who could decide the outcome of the presidential election.</p> <p>The group hopes that by creating a local army of activists equipped with sophisticated online micro-targeting tools it will increase its impact on moderate voters, nudging them towards a staunchly conservative position opposed to President Obama's economic and healthcare policies. Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is spending tens of millions of dollars developing its local strategy, already employing more than 200 permanent staff in 32 states.</p> <p>Classified a non-profit \"social welfare\" organisation, AFP is legally obliged to project itself as a non-partisan campaign that neither endorses nor opposes candidates for public office. But there is no disguising its targets, nor their political nature.</p> <p>In Ohio, volunteers are given a script which they follow when engaging voters. \"President Obama took office three years ago and promised to fix our economy,\" they say, \"yet unemployment is still high and our debt is up to $6tn.\"</p> <p>AFP has already spent $30m so far this election cycle in opposing President Obama and other prominent Democratic candidates and their policies. It says it aims to reach up to 9 million targeted voters in crucial swing states, through the efforts of its 2 million activists.</p> <p>But it is ambitions do not stop on election day on 6 November. \"The goal is to build a long-term grassroots infrastructure,\" its president, Tim Phillips, told the Guardian. \"We are not some election-year group desperately trying to ramp up attention \u2013 we are in this year-in year-out to make a difference in favour of economic freedom.\"</p> <p>AFP's growing influence is highly visible in Ohio, one of the most crucial battleground states upon which November's outcome depends. It now has 80 paid staff operating in the state out of seven permanent offices.</p> <p>Volunteers are empowered with mobile canvassing technology that directs them to the households that are most likely to be influenced by AFP's message of small government and tax cuts through software built on to handheld tablet computers. They are also equipped with the latest phone banking technology through which they have made 400,000 calls to Ohio's voters since May.</p> <p>AFP's funding status allows it to raise unlimited sums from undisclosed sources, among them David and Charles Koch, brothers whose oil, coal and plastics businesses have earned them personal wealth of $25bn each. David Koch is president of the organisation's foundation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/2012/09/12/convention-or-ad-bounce/\">Research by the independent Wesleyan Media Project</a> has found that AFP is spending an astonishing $6m every two weeks on TV advertising that favours Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy. That pays for more than 7,000 TV ads to be served in the battleground states and outguns even Romney's own spending on political adverts.</p> <p>With the presidential race tightening across the country in the wake of Obama's widely denounced performance in the first TV debate earlier this month, all eyes have turned to Ohio, which Romney must win if he is to have a fighting chance of taking the White House. No Republican candidate in history has won the presidency without bagging Ohio's electoral college votes that today stand at 18 out of the 270 needed for victory.</p> <p>Polls vary widely in Ohio, making predictions difficult. But the latest tracking survey by Real Clear Politics has Obama two points ahead of Romney \u2013 a statistical tie.</p> <p>AFP is also waging an aggressive campaign against Sherrod Brown, the Democratic senator for Ohio, under the rubric: \"Has Brown worked for you?\" It has a fleet of vans bearing the senator's picture with the logo: \"Obama's rubber stamp for failure.\"</p> <p>Leading figures within the Ohio Democratic party have been watching the activities of AFP and other outlying conservative groups with mounting alarm. Ted Strickland, the former Democratic governor of Ohio, told the Guardian that in his view the activities of such groups had the capacity \"to move us from a democracy to an oligarchy where a handful of wealthy people use their money to try to control the political process\".</p> <p>Strickland said that Brown's struggle to get re-elected was a \"clear example of the corrosive influence of outside money. He should be 20 points ahead were it not for a massive amount of negative advertising coming from billionaires trying to buy a senate seat\".</p> <p>(Recent polls have put Brown and his Republican challenger, Josh Mandel, neck and neck, though the latest survey from the Columbus Dispatch shows the incumbent pulling ahead.)</p> <p>AFP's ground operation in Ohio and other states is built around an interactive online network that links its volunteers with a centralised database of information on millions of American voters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/07/koch-brothers-database-2012-election\">The database, called Themis after the Greek god of wisdom</a>, was created with the help of seed money from the Kochs.</p> <p>The database draws information on voters from a range of public and commercial sources to create a profile of their likely political behaviour. What you buy on Amazon; the magazines your subscribe to; your friends on Facebook; your age, neighbourhood, occupation and house value; what petitions you have signed; what church you belong to; whether or not you own a gun \u2013 all such data points and many more go towards the creation of your personal, albeit anonymous, voter file.</p> <p>That, in turn, allows AFP activists to micro-target households with a level of precision that could only be dreamed about in previous generations. \"This is an exponential leap forward for our side \u2013 with Themis as our crucial partner, we are able to leverage our dollars and refine our message,\" Phillips said.</p> <p>Much media attention has been paid this election cycle to the avalanche of billionaires' money, including that of the Koch brothers, that has been spent on negative TV adverts. But in the longer term, the creation of this local lattice of activists able to identify key voters through online micro-targeting could prove to be a far more effective political weapon.</p> <p>In AFP's case, its interactive database serves up what the group calls an \"affinity score\" for each voter. He or she is awarded a number from 0 to 1. Those registering 0 on the scale being so leftwing and pro-government in outlook that, from the organisation's perspective, they are not worth bothering with.</p> <p>Those showing a 1 are equally worth bypassing because they are already so in favour of tax and spending cuts that to talk to them would be preaching to the converted. The technology is interactive, so that if a volunteer discovers that the affinity score of a voter on the doorstep is inaccurate \u2013 he or she is found to be more or less fiscally conservative than the rating suggests \u2013 it can be instantly corrected. The information is sent back at the push of a button to Themis, which is thus constantly updated and improved.</p> <p>The target group for AFP are those voters who fall between 0.4 and 0.6 on the affinity score \u2013 those moderate voters deemed by its digital planners to be \"persuadables\". \"Our goal is to get everybody into the 0.7 to 1 zone. We want to move the center towards economic freedom, to drive the debate through word-of-mouth marketing,\" says Matt Seaholm, the national field director of AFP.</p> <p>He added that in his view it was working; that AFP were driving the debate to the right. \"Cap-in-trade is now a dirty word. Stimulus is now a dirty word. Debt and spending are at the forefront. These were things that were not talked about in the past.\"</p> <p>AFP began testing its new micro-targeting gadgetry in Wisconsin last year, where it used the technology to energise its 120,000 activists in a succession of volatile recall elections. The group's efforts were one factor behind the survival of the Tea Party-backed governor, Scott Walker, in his recall vote this June.</p> <p>Phillips rejects the argument that AFP and other conservative outside groups are having a pernicious impact on the democratic process. \"We are proud to have the support of the Kochs. They have every right to be involved in the political process \u2013 they have been steadfast in this area for four decades.\"</p> <p>He added that for Obama and other Democrats to complain about corporate money entering politics was \"hypocrisy at its greatest. It's laughable, and most Americans know it. Obama receives tens of millions from Hollywood and the entertainment industry \u2013 so that is good money, and other money is bad?\"</p>",

I'm standing in for Andrew Sparrow today, who incidentally has just this morning won another award - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eidigest/statuses/258840187092729856\">Editorial Intelligence's best mainstream media blogger</a>.

There have been warnings that such a move would kill competition.

Click here to listen</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Lakisha Kimberly \"Kish\" Robinson (vocals).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> We had a few (actually, a lot of) responses to our New Band of the Day No 1,279 in May, when we wrote about Floridian rapper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/30/new-band-kitty-pryde\" title=\"\">Kitty Pryde</a>, mainly of the, \"Yeah, whatever \u2013 really, though, you should check out Kilo Kish\" variety. Five months later, we're doing exactly that. And we're impressed, although there is less of the sweetly scabrous attitude that had us calling Pryde \"Tyler Swift\". Luckily, the smeary, bleary space-crunk is in full effect, as is the Neptunes worship: if <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pharrellwilliams\" title=\"\">Pharrell Williams</a> was a 22-year-old female Brooklynite originally from Orlando (must be something in Florida's water), he'd sound something like Lakisha Robinson, aka Kilo Kish.</p> <p>Funnily \u2013 or oddly (make that Oddly) \u2013 enough, it's Kish, not Pryde (who had to content herself with Twitter props from Earl Sweatshirt) who has been working with some of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/19/tyler-the-creator-goblin-review\" title=\"\">Tyler, the Creator's Wolf Gang</a>: Syd tha Kid, Matt Martians, Hal Williams, Vince Staples \u2013 those individuals from OF's orbit responsible for the swirly, jazzy future muzak; basically, the characters who comprise <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/dec/21/new-band-internet-odd-future\" title=\"\">the Internet</a> (Kish returned the favour when she appeared on their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jan/15/internet-purple-naked-ladies-review\" title=\"\">Purple Naked Ladies</a> LP).</p> <p>Kilo Kish stays true to the dirty south fascination for all things fantastical and futuristic. Throughout her HomeSchool EP, produced by Syd and crew, the mood is giddily mellifluous, all warped synth whorls over which Kish breathily, distractedly sing-raps like a female Drake in space. In one of her videos, she is found floating somewhere dark and far from Earth, the idea to signal that she is a sister from another planet. On the single Navy, the sci-fi imagery (\"Give me a Martian name \u2026 Galaxy crusader \u2026 starlight \u2026 endless flight \u2026 solar system \u2026 deep space\") is rife, as it <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrKjawtXY3s\" title=\"\">has been in much urban music since disco</a>.</p> <p>Kish rarely deviates from this spaced-out mode, and it's not clear what it means to her: an escape from reality? The sometime textile designer and artist doesn't appear to have endured too much hardship in her young life, although in a 17-page <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/music/2012/08/who-is-kilo-kish\" title=\"\">feature on her in Complex</a>, she does allude to an absentee father and an invalid mother. And it's rare on HomeSchool that her skippy, trippy tone is infused with anything suggestive of hidden torment. There is nothing remotely approaching the snarkiness of Pryde, let alone the sulfurous unpleasantness of Tyler. On Tb70ft she coos, \"I plan to make your brain explode \u2026 I'm so motherfucking hard\", but it's on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/27/tune-psych-the-new-black-psychedelia\" title=\"\">lysergic R&amp;B</a> of Julienne that she makes her sole detour into OF's torture chamber, when she takes revenge on a lover by cutting off his face.</p> <p>Apart from this, the only controversies surrounding Kish remain the title of the first song she ever wrote (Ooo, Nigga, Ooo) and the questionable quality of her \"flow\". As one respondent to the Complex piece wrote of her: \"Seriously, WHY does this chick have an article on Complex about her? She is SO utterly talentless it's ridiculous. She cannot rap, she doesn't even sound good.\" We like the meandering, almost boho-beat wooziness of her delivery and the attendant drugged-out jazz-funk, but we do worry \u2013 perhaps controversially \u2013 that without the sinister subterfuge of her (mostly) male counterparts, all this wispy wistfulness might make listeners drift off.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Kilo Kish brings a heavy Kendrick Lamar/Ab-Soul vibe to her new space-funk single Navy\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://stereogum.com/1154282/kilo-kish-navy-video/video/\" title=\"\">Stereogum</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> She's like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/10/angel-haze-review\" title=\"\">Angel Haze</a> without the socio-political content.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Become Pharrell's wife on Mars.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Feature over 17 pages of the Guardian.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Navy is out now on Blue Rider, and the HomeSchool EP is free to download from her Soundcloud.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> <a href=\"http://guardianmusic.tumblr.com/post/25022319839/kitty-pryde-the-most-divisive-figure-in-the-field-of\" title=\"\">Kitty Pryde</a>, the Internet, Angel Haze, the Jet Age of Tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/kilo-kish\" title=\"\">soundcloud.com/kilo-kish</a>.</p> <p><strong>Friday's new band:</strong> Arlissa.</p>",
  "<p>After a decade-long ordeal, Gary McKinnon has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-extradition-decision-live\" title=\"\">been spared extradition to the US</a>. McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, stands accused of hacking into the Pentagon and Nasa in his hunt for \"little green men\". As director of Liberty, I have long argued that, as the alleged crime happened in the UK (McKinnon's bedroom in London), a British judge should decide whether he should face justice here.</p> <p>Theresa May has shown compassion in blocking his removal. It is now for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether he hasn't suffered enough.</p> <p>Ultimately, it was the much-maligned Human Rights Act (HRA) that saved McKinnon. After two Home Office-appointed psychiatrists warned he would likely end his own life if extradited, it was the only legislation the home secretary could rely upon to block his removal \u2013 concluding that it would be incompatible with article 3's protection against inhuman and degrading treatment and torture. Given her recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/19/theresa-may-coalition-human-rights-act-scrap\" title=\"\">party conference pledge </a>to scrap the act altogether, one hopes she may now reflect on its value.</p> <p>Regrettably her compassion \u2013 and promise to overhaul our extradition laws \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/babar-ahmad-extradition\" title=\"\">came too late</a> for Babar Ahmad and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/09/solitary-confinement-talha-ahsan-poet\" title=\"\">Talha Ahsan</a>, who were sent to the US earlier this month. McKinnon's case not only highlights the importance of the HRA, it also exposes the dire lack of other safeguards. May's timing must be of considerable frustration to the Ahmad and Ahsan families. Cases can always be distinguished but a substantial part of Ahmad's alleged conduct also occurred in the UK.</p> <p>Given the discriminatory experience of the past 10 years \u2013 punishment without trial; blanket stop and search \u2013 it is easy to understand the Muslim community's perception that a different set of rules applies. So while we pay tribute to McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, we must not forget the loved ones of those less fortunate. The home secretary has promised change. She must legislate urgently to prevent future injustice.</p> <p>May's decision to introduce a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-theresa-may-human-rights?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">forum bar</a>\", announced at the same time McKinnon's removal was blocked, is hugely welcome. It means that British courts could bar extradition when an alleged crime has happened in the UK. But more reform is desperately needed.</p> <p>Surely no one should be sent anywhere without a basic case first being presented in a British court? Unbelievably May has ruled this out \u2013 even though both the joint committee on human rights and home affairs select committee <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2012/liberty-welcomes-influential-committee-s-call-for-urgent.php\" title=\"\">support it</a>. The experience of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/12/gary-mckinnon-andrew-symeou\" title=\"\">Andrew Symeou</a> \u2013 plucked from his London home and left languishing in a Greek jail for 11 months <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13810608\" title=\"\">only to be acquitted</a> \u2013 demonstrates poignantly how unjust this is. In addition reform is needed so that no one can be extradited for something that is not a crime in the UK (as can currently happen within the EU) and there should be a greater focus on whether extradition is a proportionate response.</p> <p>There is a real danger that what is being given with one hand will be taken away with another. Hidden in the home secretary's statement this week was the proposal to scrap an automatic right of appeal against extradition. She also, bizarrely, wants to remove the very power she used to stop McKinnon's extradition so that only judges would decide whether extradition would breach a person's human rights. What if something significant changes after a court's final determination but before someone is put on a plane? The home secretary would be powerless to intervene \u2013 it is crucial that this safeguard is maintained. Naturally, much of the recent focus has been on extradition to the US, but what about other countries? Among others, the Extradition Act covers both Russia and Azerbaijan \u2013 not known for their fair and just criminal justice systems.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the home secretary should be congratulated \u2013 as should parliament for its dedication to the extradition issue. Figures from across the political spectrum have united behind this cause and demanded change. When new legislation emerges, parliamentarians must enact progressive reforms but prevent anything that would send us backwards.</p> <p>That McKinnon's nightmare lasted an entire decade demonstrates that unfair extraditions will inevitably be drawn out for long periods. Proper due process safeguards and greater co-operation with prosecution counsels would accelerate the entire system, with unjust extradition requests promptly dismissed and appropriate domestic prosecutions proceeding quickly and effectively. Until that happens, ordinary families will remain susceptible to the devastation of extradition devoid of evidence and common sense. It makes no sense that a vulnerable, autistic man was ever branded a cyber-terrorist \u2013 a nonsense that the government must now end.</p>",
  "<p>The distinctive character actor John Clive, who has died aged 79, will be best remembered by cinemagoers for his appearances in a string of films that gained cult status. In The Italian Job (1969), the British-flag-flying yarn about a daring heist in Turin using Minis as getaway cars, Clive was the garage manager gleefully receiving a wad of banknotes from the released convict Michael Caine as payment for storing his Aston Martin DB4 convertible. The scene was said to have been ad-libbed between the two actors, with Caine putting his enforced absence down to tiger shoots in India. \"You must have shot an awful lot of tigers, sir,\" said Clive as he counted the notes enthusiastically. \"Yes, I used a machine gun,\" retorted Caine.</p> <p>Two years later, Clive was the tormentor forcing Malcolm McDowell's psychotic teenager into licking his boot while undergoing corrective treatment in Stanley Kubrick's stunning but disturbing adaptation of Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange. In the 1968 animated Beatles feature Yellow Submarine, Clive provided the voice of John Lennon. Although the Fab Four made a brief live-action cameo appearance at the end, they had been unwilling to provide the voices for the cartoon characters themselves, so actors were sought. However, the film's producers went to great lengths not to publicise this fact. When Clive and his fellow voice artists received no invitations to the premiere, he threatened to take the story to the press. The studio relented and Clive recalled: \"We came out and thought, 'None of these people know it's us.'\"</p> <p>Clive contributed to another British institution when he appeared in two Carry On films. He played the first openly gay character in the series in Carry On Abroad (1972), freezing along with the rest of the cast as he wore a T-shirt and swimming trunks on a Pinewood Studios lot doubling as a Spanish resort. In Carry On Dick (1974), he was a tailor. His scene as a court dandy in Carry On Henry (1971) ended up on the cutting-room floor.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Clive made a brief appearance in The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976), as the colourfully dressed ma\u00eetre d' leading Peter Sellers's Inspector Clouseau to his table in a Soho club. In more sober attire, Clive was the French president's aide in Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978).</p> <p>After writing the million-selling historical novel KG 200 (1977) with JD Gilman (the pen-name of Douglas Orgill and Jack Fishman), about a secret second world war Luftwaffe unit, Clive had further success as an author. His other books included The Last Liberator (1980), Barossa (1982), Broken Wings (1983), ARK (with Nicolas Head, 1986) and The Lions' Cage (1987).</p> <p>He was born Clive John Frederick Hambley in London. His family moved to Liverpool while he was a child and he was evacuated to Wales during the second world war. On leaving school aged 14, he worked as a page at the Shakespeare theatre, Liverpool. He auditioned for a children's show there and was given a singing role, as well as assisting the resident comic in sketches. At the age of 15, he landed the title role in The Winslow Boy. After national service in the RAF, he performed in summer shows, then revues at the Poor Millionaire theatre club, London. Having previously acted as Clive Kendall, he juggled his forenames to adopt the professional name John Clive.</p> <p>He made his television debut in the BBC Wednesday Play production Wear a Very Big Hat (1965), directed by Ken Loach, and was seen regularly in dramas and comedy. He was a garden gnome in the writer Jimmy Perry's The Gnomes of Dulwich (1969), Cyfarthfa in a six-part adaptation of How Green Was My Valley (1975-76), Hinks in The History of Mr Polly (1980), and PC Emlyn Harris, one of the police officers coping with the arrival of a family of petty crooks on their patch, in The Nesbitts are Coming (1980). He also played the eccentric professor of the title in the children's series Robert's Robots (1973-74).</p> <p>Clive is survived by his second wife, the actor Bryony Elliott, whom he married in 2001, and Alexander and Hannah, the two children from his marriage to Carole Ann White, which ended in divorce.</p> <p>\u2022 John Clive (Clive John Frederick Hambley), actor and writer, born 6 January 1933; died 14 October 2012</p>",
  "<h2>TO THE MANOR YAWN</h2> <p>It's well documented that you shouldn't drive or operate heavy machinery after taking sleeping tablets; you may nod off at the wheel and accidentally plough your bulldozer through Freddy Krueger's rose garden. But considering the media palaver being made out of the news that a few footballers popped pills before hitting the hay in Warsaw on Tuesday night, the good people at Nytol may consider adding \"play football for England\" to the list of Things You Mustn't Do while under the effect of their product.</p> <p>While it should be stressed that no England players have actually blamed the effects of sleeping pills for their poor collective performance against Poland, a massive fuss has been made out of a throwaway comment by their manager Mr Roy, in which he mentioned that some of them take caffeine to make them more alert before matches, then take sleeping pills to make them less alert after they go to bed.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/tory-privatisation-plans-blow-cornwall\" title=\"\">acrimonious toppling of Alec Robertson</a>, former Tory leader of Cornwall county council over his attempts to push through a \u00a3300m outsourcing deal that would see 2,000 public sector jobs floated off to the corporate sector is, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/thatcher-outsourcing-fantasy-fails-reality\" title=\"\">as I wrote this week</a>, merely the latest in a string of political disasters to afflict the proponents of local government mega-privatisation deals.</p> <p>Robertson had <a href=\"http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/news/cornwall_news/9910859.Wholesale_privatisation_at_Cornwall_Council_hits_a_big_bump_in_the_road/\" title=\"\">ignored a vote by the full council in September which</a> had called for a halt to the unpopular plans, and vowed to press on. Last week, however, his deputy Jim Currie <a href=\"http://efficiency.governmentcomputing.com/news/cornwall-council-deputy-leader-resigns-over-300m-outsourcing-plan?CMP=EMCSOCEML657\" title=\"\">resigned in protest</a>. Currie, a former council leader and the cabinet member in charge of the county's finances, declared his conscience would not allow him to support a plan that loaded billions of pounds of potential risk on to the council.</p> <p>At that point, Tuesday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/tory-privatisation-plans-blow-cornwall\" title=\"\">no confidence vote</a> in Robertson became inevitable. Currie, who had declared the proposed deal \"unacceptable\" and <a href=\"http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Cornwall-Council-press-ahead-privatising-services/story-16829254-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">\"dangerous\"</a> was elected as the new leader after over two hours of dramatic debate that blogger and independent Cornwall county councillor Andrew Wallis <a href=\"http://www.cllrandrewwallis.co.uk/the-most-surreal-day-at-cornwall-council/\" title=\"\">described </a>as:</p> <blockquote> The Most Surreal Day at Cornwall Council </blockquote> <p>The outsourcing plan as it stands looks to be in tatters: one of the two bidders competing to be part of the deal, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), <a href=\"http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Bidder-pulls-Cornwall-Council-privatisation/story-17100491-detail/story.html?8625490618&amp;redirected=true\" title=\"\">has now pulled out</a> (the other is BT).</p> <p>Where this leaves the Cornwall chief executive Kevin Lavery, who fulsomely backed it, remains to be seen. Lavery (an outsourcing expert who <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kevin-lavery/4/827/165\" title=\"\">coincidentally once worked for BT</a>) published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/15/whitehall-empower-cornwall-shire-counties\" title=\"\">a piece on the Guardian Public Leaders site</a> just the day before the confidence vote in which he proposed a devolved \"county deal\" for Cornwall which would see the council operate, ultimately, as:</p> <blockquote> ...a small but perfectly formed state government. </blockquote> <p>This in turn would:</p> <blockquote> \"Provide an exciting opportunity to test new models of governance, organisational delivery and even funding mechanisms.\" </blockquote> <p>These exciting opportunities may indeed come to pass: it is clear that in the current financial climate local authorities will have to adopt radical new approaches to the way they do things. But it looks unlikely that Cornwall's now beleaguered<a href=\"http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=32041\" title=\"\"> Strategic Partnership</a> model, which proposed the creation of a huge joint venture involving the council, local NHS organisations and a major private sector outsourcing firm, will be the way to achieve it.</p> <p>The Cornwall fiasco was particularly interesting in how it dramatised divisions among Tory local politicians about how best to deal with massive Coalition funding cuts, and the challenges these impose on local government.</p> <p>At risk of over-simplification, it seems there are those, like Robertson, who appear to believe with revolutionary fervour that the age of austerity demands There Is No Alternative to the bold, mass business-isation of council services; and those, like Currie, who appear to have higher risk thresholds, a more cautious assessment of the potential efficiency gains of outsourcing, and more pressing concerns about accountability and political control of services.</p> <p>It's worth reading Currie's resignation letter from last week, and Robertson's in parts rather tart response. Currie is a former Cornwall leader, and until he resigned, a key member of the council leadership's inner circle and close ally of Robertson.</p> <p>Here's Currie's epistle, which I found on <a href=\"http://www.cllrandrewwallis.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wallis's blog </a> (along with Lib Dem councillor <a href=\"http://cllrjeremyrowe.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Jeremy Rowe's blog</a>, worth a read for their accounts of the Cornwall outsourcing crisis):</p> <blockquote> Alec <br>I am resigning from the Cabinet today as I feel that I have pushed the cause of retaining Council control over Joint Ventures as far as I can with the Cabinet. <br>The financial risks involved with the rush into the new Joint Venture proposals are unacceptable. The JV [Joint Venture] is basically too large to control. We have wasted \u00a342m+ on the Unitary, \u00a342m+ on the Incinerator and we are now proposing to risk a great deal more on the Joint Venture. <br>I welcome your somewhat ambiguous offer to respect Full Council decisions on the 23rd October but I know you will never let go. <br>I could not leave local government with billions of pounds of Cornish Taxpayers money at risk and on my conscience. <br>Alec, this matter has never been personal. <br>Yours aye <br>Jim <br> </blockquote> <p>Here are relevant extracts from Robertson's lengthy reply, which I obtained from the county council:</p> <blockquote> Dear Jim <br>... I have always respected the fact that the joint venture proposal is a matter of strongly held principle for you and, although you were clearly out of step with the rest of the Cabinet, I like many others, have admired your customary fortitude... <br> We have discussed, at length, your views on the risks and scale of the proposal and the ability of the Council to ensure adequate control and democratic accountability in it. We clearly have varying levels of risk aversion and my experience outside the public sector, in common with the rest of the Cabinet Members, gives us a different perspective on the private business sector. </blockquote> <p>Note the slightly patronising suggestion that only businessmen like himself with \"experience outside the public sector\" really understand the risks of huge outsourcing deals like this. He continues:</p> <blockquote> We also have a different view on the future prospects for local government finance which I, again in common with the rest of the Cabinet, expect to be more challenging than you have stated in our previous discussions. In fact, much of the debate around the Joint Venture proposal seems to me to indicate a clash of cultures between those who seem to think that life is tough now but eventually things will return to 'normal' and those of us who recognise that we must actually adapt to the 'new normal'. <br>We can only do this by being brave, radical, innovative and much more businesslike and that means taking more calculated and managed risks and working faster than in the past. The alternative is an inevitable decline in services as our resources reduce further while demands on them increase and I know we are both passionate about protecting services \u2013 particularly for our most vulnerable residents. </blockquote> <p>He adds:</p> <blockquote> No-one knows better than you that this administration, in the short time that we have been together, has achieved an enviable and envied record of protecting services from the impact of financial cuts, unprecedented in a lifetime. We have done this by being proactive, going early, staying one step ahead and addressing our challenges before the crisis hits. In the Cabinet's strongly held view, the Joint Venture proposal is an important step in that direction as well as a great opportunity to strengthen Cornwall's resilience in the face of the coming storm. <br>Jim, I am sorry that this next step on the journey is a step too far for you but I will always be grateful for all you have done in supporting me as a Cabinet Member and as my deputy over the past three and a half years. You have done a great job of covering my 6 o'clock and I suspect more daggers will find their way through without you there to cover my back. <br>Yours aye <br>Alec </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure what \"covering my 6 o'clock\" means, but I suspect that this kind of debate - how far should we go on outsourcing - is happening in Tory-controlled councils up and down the land as they anticpate to ever-diminishing local government funding streams.</p> <p>The question for Currie is now whether he has a Plan B? We will see. It is clear, however, that his concerns about levels of risk and accountability attached to big long term outsourcing deals, are not uncommon.</p> <p>This<a href=\"http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2012/09/no-outsourcing-bonanza-in-local-government/\" title=\"\"> this illuminating article</a> by John Tizard, a former Capita executive, now an academic and consultant, explains why, for a whole range of reasons, many of them invoked by opponents of the Cornwall plan, local government's appetite for grand, monolithic outsourcing projects and joint ventures is diminishing.</p> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote> I am not suggesting for a moment that there will not be more outsourcing to the business sector. Rather, I think, it likely that such outsourcing will be on a different basis to much that has happened before \u2013 and without the scale of growth that some had expected. </blockquote>",

It includes accounts from relatives of several people who disappeared. Here are a couple of them:</p> <h2>Amer Abdullah</h2> <blockquote> <p>Amer Abdullah, 32, is from Sinjar near the city of Ma\u2019arat al Numan in the province of Idlib. His brother Hisham told Avaaz: \"My brother was just a farmer before the beginning of the revolution. With the beginning of the demonstrations in our area, the security forces stifled us, denying access to basic supplies that we cannot live without, specifically oil fuel that we use for heating. My brother contributed to bringing fuel oil from several fuel stations to be distributed to the residents.</p> <p>\"On February 18, 2012, and while heading to a fuel station to bring fuel oil, he passed a military checkpoint in the area of Wadi al Daif, east to the city of Ma\u2019arat al Numan, and was arrested there. Since then, we do not know anything about him except for news from recently released detainees. We last heard about him 3 months ago, we were told that he was in the prison of Mazzeh, physically weak and that he lost a lot of weight. We still don\u2019t know in which security branch he is being held. We did not dare to go and ask about him for fear of being arrested.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Anas al-Shaghri</h2> <blockquote> <p>Anas al-Shaghri is 23 and a nonviolent protester who was disappeared in a rural area of Banyas shortly after the protests in the town began. His sister said: \"On the 14th of May, 2011, my brother was arrested and handed over after midnight by someone he trusted. He was supposed to meet him to change his place of hiding. When we contacted this person he told us: \u2018Yes, I handed Anas over myself.\u2019 Since then we have not heard any news from my brother, except for some information that he was in Branch 291 State Security in Damascus. We heard that through one of the recently released detainees. He also told us that Anas was in solitary confinement and was subjected to severe torture. This left me in a state of fear and horror over my brother to the point where I cried every day just imagining what could have happened to him.</p> <p>\"Every time we ask about Anas they deny that he was detained in one of their security branches. We hired a lawyer for this matter but to no avail. What made Anas\u2019s case unique is that he was one of the first to call for peaceful demonstrations in Banyas. He used his friendships and his strong charismatic personality to incite demonstrations. Anas was also one of the most active media spokesmen in the city of Banyas, he was in constant contact with various news outlets; this made the security forces and Shabiha more resentful and hateful towards him.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-18T10:33:39.810Z\">at 11.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507fc5cec0e361310bc6d146\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-18T09:03:10.084Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yemen explosions blamed on electrical fault</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is another \u2013 very dramatic \u2013 picture showing multiple explosions in the Yemeni capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/status/258853667040555009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>wow the explosion is very big ! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23previoustweet\">#previoustweet</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Yemen\">#Yemen</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/tPCQMFLq\" title=\"http://twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/status/258853667040555009/photo/1\">twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash;Hind Aleryani\u0647\u0646\u062f(@Dory_Eryani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/status/258853667040555009\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-18T08:54:58+00:00\">October 18, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Macoombs/status/258850794378506241\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Yemenis crowded on their rooftops watching columns of smoke rise from explosions hitting base of a hilltop in NW area of Sanaa, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Yemen\">#Yemen</a>.</p>&mdash; Casey L Coombs (@Macoombs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Macoombs/status/258850794378506241\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-18T08:43:33+00:00\">October 18, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>General Ali Muhsen's people are claiming that it was caused by an electrical fault:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BaFana3/status/258854548293165056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Yemen\">#Yemen</a> | Gen Ali Muhsin's news site : Explosions in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Sanaa\">#Sanaa</a> weapons store due to electrical fault.

  "<p>For much of his career Igor Sechin \u2013 a former Soviet spy and close ally of Vladimir Putin \u2013 has been a man in the shadows. During Putin's first presidential stint, the joke doing the rounds in Moscow was that Sechin didn't actually exist: instead, US diplomats mischievously suggested, he was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman invented by the Kremlin to instil fear.</p> <p>Today, however, Sechin, the chairman of Rosneft, has taken another step away from the dark. He has offered a deal that would see Rosneft acquire BP's stake in its troubled Russian joint venture TNK-BP, with BP in return acquiring 10%-20% of Rosneft. The Russian company has reportedly offered BP $28bn in shares and cash. Sechin has overseen the deal himself: he flew from Moscow to London on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The tie-up would see Rosneft leap from near-obscurity just over a decade ago to become the world's biggest publicly traded oil company \u2013 an extraordinary rise that can only be put down to Sechin himself.</p> <p>During Putin's first two presidential terms, Sechin was Putin's deputy chief of staff. In 2008 Dmitry Medvedev \u2013 Putin's weak temporary successor \u2013 made Sechin deputy prime minister, a demotion. When Putin came back to the Kremlin in May, many were surprised when he failed to offer Sechin a government job.</p> <p>But Sechin's official positions in Russia's hierarchy understate his real influence. During the Putin era it is Sechin who has been in charge of Russia's energy sector, up until 2008 operating largely from behind the scenes. His power flows from his perceived closeness to Putin. Not only are they friends with a common KGB heritage but, according to leaked US diplomatic cables, they also share \"economic interests\".</p> <p>Sechin is widely regarded to be the head of the Kremlin's <em>siloviki</em> clan, made up of nationalist hardliners with a security or military background. He is a proponent of strong state control, especially in the energy sector. The <em>siloviki</em> are at odds with a modernising camp inside the Kremlin, some analysts suggest, who favour greater economic liberalisation and Russia's integration with the west. Putin, meanwhile, plays the role of intra-elite arbiter, balancing the interests of both factions.</p> <p>Others, however, dismiss this as rubbish. They say the internecine struggles inside the Kremlin are not about political philosophy or ideology, but merely battles between rival clans trying to divide up the spoils. (In Russia, the spoils amount to billions of dollars.)</p> <p>Sechin has often been seen as a competitor to the moderate Medvedev within Russia's ruling elite. More realistic, however, is the scathing view that Medvedev was only ever the \"number three guy\" \u2013 behind Putin and Sechin in terms of power and influence.</p> <p>To his enemies, Sechin is a malevolent figure, a Kremlin grey cardinal crossed with the Big Bad Wolf. The charge list against him goes something like this: it was Sechin who personally engineered the demise of the oil giant Yukos in 2003, and the jailing of its billionaire owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky. (Rosneft promptly swallowed Yukos's assets; Khodorkovsky is still in jail.) Sechin also led the <em>siloviki's</em> opposition to foreign investment in Russia, especially in oil and gas. And there are suspicions that it is Sechin who has directed oil exports towards the murky Swiss-based oil trader Gunvor, while sidelining other customers.</p> <p>But there are pluses as well. In a 2009 John Beyrle, then US ambassador in Moscow, listed some of Sechin's achievements. He had, the ambassador wrote, \"unquestionably transformed Russia's most dismal oil company into a globally competitive state champion (albeit with Yukos's assets)\", adding that \"he also protected Rosneft from a putative merger with Gazprom in apparent contradiction of Putin's desires\". The ambassador cited further examples of Sechin's \"enlightened management\" \u2013 he listens to minority shareholders, unusual in Russia, and even hired an American as Rosneft's chief financial officer. The diplomatic cables, though, reveal that a frustrated US government has had \"virtually no interaction\" with Sechin.</p> <p>It is too early to parse just what the BP-Rosneft deal means. But Sechin appears to have recognised that Rosneft can only become a major global champion with international investment and expertise. Russia is still the world's largest producer and exporter of hydrocarbons. But the country's energy sector has stood still for some time, and may even be slipping backwards \u2013 with oil production stagnant, underinvestment in exploration and production, and heavy-handed state control.</p> <p>In common with other suspected former KGB officers, Sechin's biography is something of a mystery. Putin famously spent the 1980s as a KGB liaison officer in communist east Germany and Dresden; Sechin \u2013 a languages graduate from Leningrad state university \u2013 was stationed in Mozambique. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he worked in the mayor's office at St Petersburg. When Putin became first deputy mayor, Sechin became his chief of staff in 1994; he has been at Putin's side ever since.</p> <p>Putin is now set to stay in the Kremlin until 2018, and possibly until 2024. Sechin, then, will remain at the summit of Russian oil power for some years to come.</p>",

  "<p>Ministers are facing the prospect of having to abandon the controversial cull of badgers in England, for this year at least, due to fast-rising costs, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/05/badger-cull-tb-cattle\" title=\"\">The cull</a>, aimed at curbing the rising infections of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, is running out of time to begin before winter weather means the badgers lie low in their setts. The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, and farming minister David Heath cancelled a series of interviews on Thursday, but department officials said there was no U-turn: \"There is no change to the badger cull policy. We want the cull to happen as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>The Guardian can reveal that the estimated number of badgers in the pilot cull areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset have turned out to be far higher than the figures used to estimate the initial cost. Farmers must commit to killing at least 70% of the badgers in the cull zone, or fleeing badgers will spread TB further. But the Guardian can also reveal that each culled badger carries a bounty on its head, which means that having to kill more badgers means costs must rise.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121017/text/121017w0001.htm#12101764001054\" title=\"\">parliamentary answer</a> on Wednesday, Heath told shadow environment secretary, Mary Creagh: \"The best estimate for the number of badgers within each pilot area is: west Gloucestershire, 3,600; west Somerset: 4,300.\" However, the environment department's original, generic estimates, before recent surveys were conducted, were 2,000-3,000 for cull zones of that size. The figures show killing costs have as much as doubled in the case of Somerset.</p> <p>A Whitehall source told the Guardian that, because the killing costs have to be borne by farmers and landowners, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) president, Peter Kendall, feels the cull may now be too expensive to carry out, given the new higher badger numbers. The government's own impact assessment had already shown that carrying out the cull will cost more than it saves. A spokesman for the NFU said they did not recognise that view from Kendall and were not aware of any change in the government's policy.</p> <p>Creagh said: \"The abandoning of the cull would be good news because we have always said the cull was bad for wildlife, bad for farmers and bad for taxpayers. The science is clear that it risks making things worse.\" On Sunday, 32 eminent scientists, including those who designed and ran a landmark 10-year culling trial, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">called on ministers to halt the cull</a>. But ministers argue that the rising costs of bovine TB \u2013 \u00a390m in 2011 and 26,000 cattle slaughtered \u2013 means that culling has to go ahead, alongside tighter biosecurity and investment in vaccination research.</p> <p>The cull licences were issued by Natural England for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england\" title=\"\">Gloucestershire on 17 September</a> and for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">Somerset on 4 October</a>. The companies managing the culls were then required only to complete some \"administrative\" steps before culling could begin, but they have not. Farmers are required to deposit enough money to fund the entire four-year cull before beginning, because failing to complete the entire cull is near certain to increase bovine TB. Natural England said not all the money had been deposited, although a spokesman added he did not think the issue was a \"deal-breaker\". He added that the drawing in of winter meant that \"the sooner the cull started, the better.\"</p> <p>The bounty being paid for each badger carcass was revealed to a concerned member of the public by Natural England. The bovine TB licensing unit emailed her: \"When the method employed free shooting, contractors are paid per badger.\"</p> <p>The Whitehall source said: \"Everyone in the department is scrambling with increasing desperation to make an unworkable policy work, so Paterson doesn't look like the failure David Cameron and Nick Clegg saw his predecessor Caroline Spelman as being.\" Paterson has been holding daily meetings on the cull.</p> <p>Further confusion arose on Thursday when Paterson <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2012-10-18/mixed-messages-on-badger-cull-whats-going-on-at-defra/\" title=\"\">twice cancelled a television interview with ITV News</a> for \"logistical reasons\" and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loubgray/statuses/258907397312114688\" title=\"\">Heath cancelled a Friday interview</a> with the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>The cull has prompted the largest animal rights protests since fox hunting was banned in 2004, and more than 150,000 people have signed an e-petition to stop it. The petition has granted opponents of the cull the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/16/badger-cull-commons-debate\" title=\"\">first ever debate in the House of Commons</a>, set for 25 October, where the government will have to vote down a motion to halt the cull.</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli cabinet may approve the legalisation of unauthorised Jewish settlement outposts in the West Bank, in a move likely to further damage peace prospects and result in censure from the international community.</p> <p>The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has indicated his intention to put sections of a government-commissioned report to a cabinet vote. However, the attorney general is reported to be opposed to the move before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/ehud-olmert-comeback-israeli-election\" title=\"\">next year's election</a>. A spokesman for the prime minister said: \"No decisions have been taken yet.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu is believed to be under pressure from extreme rightwing pro-settler elements within his party, Likud, in the runup to the election on 22 January. Israel Radio reported that the prime minister had instructed the cabinet secretary to draft a motion endorsing sections of the <a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/English/MediaCenter/Spokesman/Documents/edmundENG100712.pdf\" title=\"\">89-page Levy repor</a>t, which was published in July.</p> <p>As well as calling for the legalisation of outposts, the report rejected international legal consensus that the West Bank was under Israeli military occupation. It said the fourth Geneva convention did not apply to the West Bank as it was not \"foreign territory\" under the sovereignty of another state.</p> <p>Critics warned that adoption of the report's conclusions would have damaging repercussions for Israel, further isolating it in the international arena and potentially killing off any chance of a resumption of talks with the Palestinians on a settlement of the decades-old conflict.</p> <p>Netanyahu intends to limit the cabinet vote to practical recommendations dealing with the legalisation of outposts, building permits and land purchase, according to reports.</p> <p>The prime minister established a three-strong panel, headed by a pro-settlement former supreme court judge, Edmond Levy, to examine unauthorised outposts in the West Bank, which are usually established by hardline, ideologically-driven settlers. Its conclusions contradicted those of a 2005 report that declared such colonies were illegal under Israeli law and should be demolished. Under international law, all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal.</p> <p>The report's publication fuelled opposition to the evacuation and demolition of two West Bank outposts, Migron and Ulpana, which were declared illegal by Israel's supreme court. Despite repeated delays by the government, both operations were eventually completed peacefully.</p> <p>Netanyahu's drive to put the Levy report to a cabinet vote is viewed by some commentators as an attempt to prevent votes leaking from Likud to parties further to the right. Opinion polls taken since the election was called last week show the rightwing block is expected to emerge with a majority of parliament's 120 seats. Likud is likely to be the biggest party, although the possible formation of a new centre-left party could change predictions.</p> <p>Netanyahu's position as leader of Likud is secure, but he is acutely aware of internal party pressures. Militant settlers have gained strength within Likud, scoring victories this year when several \u2013 including radical activists from hilltop outposts \u2013 were elected to the party's central committee and their leader, Moshe Feiglin, secured about 25% of votes in a challenge to Netanyahu for the party chairmanship. About 7% of Likud's 130,000 registered members live in West Bank settlements.</p> <p>Netanyahu is also under pressure from smaller pro-settler parties to the right of Likud, which have called for the conclusions of the Levy report to be adopted.</p> <p>Both the centrist Kadima and the centre-left Labour party criticised the move to endorse sections of the report. The defence minister, Ehud Barak, also made clear his opposition, saying: \"Adopting the report will not bolster the settlement in Judea and Samaria [the biblical name for the West Bank], it will merely undermine Israel's diplomacy efforts and further isolate Israel from the world.\"</p> <p>Tamar Feldman, of the Association of Civil Rights in Israel, said: \"The situation in the West Bank is neither normal nor legal, and any attempt to authorise or normalise it threatens the rule of law in the state of Israel.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>I'm looking for a portable router that can be used in hotel rooms and houses where there is wired broadband but no Wi-Fi. I would also like to be able to vary the strength of the signal, with the idea that generating just enough signal for a single room may be preserving battery power for these small portable devices.</em><br><strong>Rhys Jones</strong><br><br>Some Wi-Fi routers allow you to vary the power, though this involves logging on to the router and hunting through the settings. It will probably be under an Advanced heading, and may be called something like Transmit Power. However, this feature is not widely known, because people usually want more power not less: hence the popularity of boosters, extenders, repeaters etc.</p> <p>I don't know of any portable \"travel routers\" that have this feature, but maybe readers can suggest some examples. These routers are usually much weaker than the sort of thing that you'd use in a home or office. <a href=\"http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/wifi-routers/375637/tp-link-wireless-n-nano-router\">PC Pro magazine</a> reviewed one of the smallest and cheapest \u2013 the TP-Link Wireless N Nano Router, advertised as 150Mbps \u2013 and found that the file transfer speed dropped from 8.5MBps when close to the router to 2.7MBps in the room next door. (Note the shift from Mbps or megabits per second to MBps or megabytes per second.)</p> <p>TP-Link is well known for this type of product. The Nano is so small you could put a couple in a shirt pocket, and it only costs <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Link-TL-WR702N-150Mbps-Wireless-Router/dp/tech-data/B006PYGWG6/\">\u00a320.89 at Amazon.co.uk</a>. So, as PC Pro concludes, \"What's not to like?\"</p> <p>The Nano isn't battery powered. It has a micro USB socket so it could either be powered from a laptop or netbook, or from the mains using the kind of plug shipped with many mobile phones and tablets. If your portable device is deficient in both Ethernet sockets and USB ports, then a mains-powered device is your best bet.</p> <p>If you want something battery powered, then the TP-Link TL-MR3040 150Mbps Wireless N Portable Battery Powered Router looks like an interesting alternative at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-Link-TL-MR3040-150Mbps-Wireless-Portable/dp/B00842KJOS/\">\u00a339.19 at Amazon.co.uk</a>. This is obviously bigger (since it includes a battery) but, if I've read the blurb correctly, you can plug in either an Ethernet cable or a 3G USB dongle to set up a Wi-Fi network. However, after 4 hours or so, you will need to recharge the battery using either the power adaptor supplied or a USB cable and a PC.</p> <p>If your mobile device is an iPad, then you might want to consider an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/airportexpress/\">Apple Airport Express</a>, which is small and powerful but a lot more expensive (\u00a379). It is mains powered, but has the power supply built in. The Airport Express has another advantage: in Apple's words, it's \"incredibly easy setup from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch\". This avoids the problem of carrying a router that you might need a PC or Mac to set up or manage when you've left the PC or Mac at home.</p> <p>The Airport Express signal will pass through walls into adjoining rooms and I don't know if there is a way to turn the signal down. (I couldn't see one in the set-up guide.) However, setting a password should ensure no one else uses your Wi-Fi.</p> <p>Personally, I prefer wired Ethernet to wireless because it is faster, more reliable, and more secure. Yes, I always carry a short Cat5 cable in my bag. But if I was planning to use a portable router in hotel rooms, I'd set it up at home first, to make sure it worked, then try it at a friend's house. No, I haven't done it myself. However, I do carry around a 3G USB dongle and sometimes one of 3's MiFi portable 3G hotspots for the times when there's neither a wired nor a Wi-Fi connection available. This usually means on trains, but it has rescued me in times of network downtime or when working in someone else's office, as well as in the odd hotel room.</p> <p>Connecting XP with no certificate</p> <p><em>On a recent trip to Europe from Australia, we used our Fujitsu M2010 netbook running Windows XP with various Wi-Fi hotspots. However, when we tried to use it in southern Spain, including in our hotel, it would not connect. The free hotspots appeared on our list of available options, and the signal was good, but the netbook was unable to locate a certificate so we couldn't connect. Any ideas on how to resolve this for the future?</em><br><strong>Paul</strong></p> <p>The simplest solution is to tell Windows XP not to require a certificate. Unfortunately, even if you'd thought of this, the setting is buried away where you'd be unlikely to find it. </p> <p>When you get this error, Windows XP pops up a bubble message in the bottom right that says: \"Windows was unable to find a certificate to log you on to the wireless network BLUE123AJ\" using the network's name, whatever it might be. Now you can solve the problem as follows:</p> <p>1: Right-click on the wireless icon in the bottom right of the Taskbar and select \"View Available Wireless Networks\". </p> <p>2: Select the BLUE123AJ wireless network (if it is not already selected) and click \"Change advanced settings\" to open the Wireless Network Connections Properties box.</p> <p>3: Click the Wireless Networks tab, which should be in the middle of the properties sheet. (If it isn't, Windows XP is not controlling your wireless settings, so you'd have to change that using the Control Panel applet for Network Connections.)</p> <p>4: Go to the list of Preferred Networks, select your network (BLUE123AJ), and click Properties to open a new properties sheet headed (in this example) \"BLUE123AJ properties\". </p> <p>5: Click the Authentication tab, which should be in the middle of the new properties sheet. </p> <p>6: Untick the box that says: \"Enable IEEE 802.1x authentication for this network\".</p> <p>7: Click OK and then OK again to close the two boxes. </p> <p>You should now be able to connect to the network.</p> <p>Try this now. XP has almost certainly remembered the name of your Spanish hotel's network, in case you need it again, so you can try removing the need for an authentication certificate. Once you have done it, there's some chance you'll remember it next time you need it. If not, get whoever is at the next table to Google BLUE123AJ and you should find this answer. (The AJ is for Ask Jack.)</p>",

Badger hunting! Imagine the Heythrop gathering on a crisp November evening for a night-time's hunting. What fun. Badgers can run jolly fast when they have to, and it would be cracking sport.

  "<p>George Osborne has been accused of opening up new tax avoidance opportunities after it emerged companies will be allowed to give back employment rights to selected workers who receive tax-free shares under his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shares-rights-scheme\" title=\"Guardian: Osborne shares for rights\">shares-for-rights scheme</a>.</p> <p>The loophole could be used to reward high-paid staff with tax-exempt shares worth up to \u00a350,000 without loss of access to fair dismissal procedures, redundancy pay and other \"gold-plated\" employment rights.</p> <p>The shares can be added to any held in other tax-free employee schemes, creating a \"pure tax advantage\" for the better off rather than simply a means of reducing rights, according to one accountant. Another said it opens up \"lots of tax abuse opportunities, including contractual abuse\".</p> <p>The scheme, trumpeted at the Conservative conference as an \"all in it together\" benefit for employees, could allow big tax avoidance opportunities to some but they will be worthless to most ordinary workers \u2013 likely to get only the minimum \u00a32,000 in shares.</p> <p>New workers can be forced to accept the \"employee-owner\" scheme in those companies that operate it. But the Treasury has acknowledged that employers can return equivalent rights to individuals on a selective basis through their personal contracts.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_91_12.htm\" title=\"Treasury\">Treasury announcement </a>said: \"Companies recruiting employee-owners will continue to have the option of inserting more generous employment conditions into the employment contract if they want to.\" They will be able to pick and choose who they give enhanced rights to. The Treasury said there would be nothing to stop an employer putting all employees in the scheme and returning rights to only some of them, or only putting some employees into it, though final details had not been worked out.</p> <p>The TUC said it looked as if \"the potential for misuse of the scheme could be significant\".</p> <p>David Ellis, head of the reward practice at accountants KPMG, said firms might use the scheme for the \"pure tax advantage\" since shares were known to increase staff performance. \"If there's a tax efficient way to give employees equity, you will use it even if you don't want to take away employment rights.\" Given the tax advantage would only accrue to those with high-value shares over a period of years \"that pushes it down a certain avenue about who to offer this to\".</p> <p>Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, said: \"There are lots of tax abuse opportunities, including contractual abuse, which accountants will want to exploit. Give them any opportunity and they will take it.\"</p> <p>But the tax concession is of little or no benefit to the ordinary worker with a small number of shares since the gains would be extremely unlikely to be more than the \u00a310,600 annual capital gains tax (CGT) exemption individuals get anyway. CGT applies to profits from selling property and <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/cgt.htm#2\" title=\"CGT rates\">ranges from 18% for those on low-income tax bands to 28% for well-paid people</a>.</p> <p>Those given shares in startup companies that become successful could make big tax-free gains. Core workers starting a firm could be given a nominal share issue representing the whole capital of the new company and waive their employment rights. Such shares can multiply many times in successful firms. \"If I did this, I would never have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the company,\" said Murphy.</p> <p>\"This is not really very useful to the average person. In a startup they are more likely to need their redundancy rights than shares in the company. It's a nonsense. There are better employee share schemes. They are never going to get the CGT exemption.\"</p> <p>He was sceptical that Osborne could get the scheme up and running by his deadline of April next year. \"There are going to have to be massive restrictions if this is not going to be subject to enormous abuse. It's going to be deeply complex with a lot of consultation and it is going to be a nightmare.\"</p> <p>The shares could be in addition to existing employee share ownership schemes such as the Enterprise Management Incentive with its \u00a3250,000 tax-efficient allowance, introduced to help small and medium-sized enterprises to recruit and retain high-calibre employees.</p> <p>The TUC said: \"If the chancellor's shares for rights idea does become a reality, it also looks like the potential for misuse of the scheme could be significant. If employees who are already paid in shares are now simply able to pay less tax on them, the main impact will be a loss in vital revenues to the Exchequer.\"</p> <p>The scheme is being overseen by the business department, which said: \"A consultation will be launched shortly setting out more detail on how this proposal will work in practice.\"</p> <h2>Expensive option<br></h2> <p>The statutory law on unfair dismissal and redundancy allows for strict procedures before an employee can be sacked. These are the procedures Osborne wants to allow firms to avoid in order to increase labour flexibility. If they are written back into some workers' contracts, the remedy for breach will be common law wrongful dismissal rather than statutory unfair dismissal. The employee would sue in a county court or at the high court (depending on the level of damages sought) rather than take an employment tribunal case.</p> <p>This option is potentially much more expensive, particularly for the losing side, so firms will not allow it to most of their workers. For a successful employee, damages for wrongful dismissal are not capped as under statutory unfair dismissal, which is limited to \u00a312,900 plus a potential \u00a372,000 compensatory award. In 2010-11 the median award was only \u00a34,591.</p> <p>Tribunal awards are higher for sex and disability discrimination, but Osborne's scheme cannot exclude such claims because of EU law.</p> <p>Nor are tribunal claims for dismissal over whistleblowing, union membership or raising health and safety issues excluded under the scheme. The rights affected are basic unfair dismissal, redundancy, including statutory payments, and the right to ask for flexible working. Increased notice will be required from women returning from maternity leave \u2013 16 weeks instead of eight.</p>",
  "<p>To an overseas player in Major League Soccer, having your salary made public knowledge seems slightly strange to say the least. Remember the furore when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/nov/01/newsstory.sport6\">John Arne Riise's wage slip was found in a Liverpool street</a> in 2007? Well, twice a year the MLS Players Union releases<a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/October%201,%202012%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf\"> the wage figures of every player in the league</a>, from the newest academy recruit to Thierry Henry. Such a degree of openness is almost impossible to comprehend within a European frame</p> <p>The latest list reaffirms what most people knew or suspected \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/Major-League-Soccer-Players-Union-publishes-latest-round-of-salary-figures.html\">the teams in the biggest media markets are the biggest spenders</a>. New York Red Bulls have three out of four of the highest-paid players in the league in Thierry Henry (No1), Raphael Marquez (No2) and Tim Cahill (No4), and by far the biggest salary outlay of any team (almost $16.75m when guaranteed wages are taken into account). </p> <p>The Los Angeles Galaxy pay out just over $12.7m in guaranteed wages, with David Beckham (No3) heading a golden trio that also includes Robbie Keane (No5) and Landon Donovan (No7). At least those two sides have competitive teams for the money \u2013 Toronto FC may be third place in the spending tables ($7.5m guaranteed), but they are dead last in the Eastern Conference while the side with the second-lowest payroll ($3.25m), Sporting Kansas City, are at the top, challenging for the Supporters Shield - hoping to climb above San Jose Earthquakes ($3.2m).</p> <p>From the outside these figures are always a cause for speculation, if not outright entertainment, with media, fans and bloggers <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/mls/2012/10/5/3458178/mls-player-salary-2012-bargains-busts\">adding columns of their own to the base statistics (SB Nation)</a>, to <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/mls/story/major-league-soccer-week-12-preview-2012-salaries-052512\">rate performance value per dollar (Fox)</a>, often in scathing terms, and with <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2012/10/timbers_kris_boyd_among_a_doze.html\">a critical eye on high-priced foreign imports who fail to produce to a degree considered proportionate to younger American team-mates.</a></p> <p>As Bob Foose, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/\">the MLS Players Union</a>, explained: \"It's something we've always done. It's not to our bargaining advantage for it to be kept secret. If anything the owners might want it to be kept secret... Occasionally it can make a player from another country or league uncomfortable, and I can see it could be embarrassing \u2013 but we explain our reasons to them and it has actually been put to the vote by players before, and they've backed it so we'll continue to do it if we think it helps us.\"</p> <p>Foose was speaking in Washington DC, where 180 delegates from players' unions around the world gathered for the FIFpro general assembly - coinciding in the calendar with the slightly more high-profile<a href=\"http://www.leadersinfootball.com/news/\"> Leaders in Football</a> conference in London, featuring the great and good of the global soccer industry.</p> <p>FIFPro is the world players' union. Accordingly, the conversation revolved around collective bargaining agreements, invasive and ineffective doping monitoring, player healthcare and pensions, intimidation of players in inadequately regulated territories and numerous other unglamorous but vital components of the daily administration and culture of the game.</p> <p>The London conference, held at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge home, featured contributions from the MLS commissioner Don Garber, Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson and Seattle Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer, as well as league officials and experienced general managers and CEOs such as Philadelphia's Nick Sakiewicz. Subjects included the MLS strategy to become a top league by 2022, the ever-vexed subject of the MLS calendar being out of synch with Fifa, and the sport's burgeoning profile in the USA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397982926\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350065414006/Bob_Foose_MLS_Players_Union_140.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Foose MLS Players Union\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Foose.

Ironically, even in representing players from such a young league, Foose and his team were relative veterans at the assembly, compared to delegates and observers from countries such as the Czech Republic \u2013 whose union, chaired by the ex-Manchester United player Karel Poborsky, was ratified by FIFPro at this year's event.</p> <p>The MLS Players Union found itself entering the conference with its profile \u2013 generally modest outside the saber-rattling periods leading up to collective bargaining agreements (the last MLS CBA was ratified in March 2010) \u2013 at one of its periodic highs, thanks to last week's publication of <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/October%201,%202012%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf\">the latest round of player salary figures</a>. </p> <p>Whatever the embarrassment felt in the locker room, the figures certainly cause a certain amount of embarrassment for the executives, as they pursue their goals of market share in their own country, let alone international credibility, with this aspect of their inner workings very much on public display.</p> <p>The counter-argument from the players is that this transparency, within the arcane system of salary caps, designated players and the daddy of all esoterica, <a href=\"http://majorleaguesoccertalk.com/2012/09/05/mls-economics-end-the-salary-cap-mystery/\">allocation money</a>, is a useful tool in benchmarking their contribution and ensuring their fair share of proceeds as the MLS business grows. Crudely put, to attract the media attention and TV deals it needs for that growth, MLS has to produce the figures that confirm it's on track. At which point the MLS Players Union can point to the salary figures to show the players enjoy a more or less equitable share of that pie at any given moment. The stats consistently make clear the very modest salaries of many of the players working in MLS \u2013 and in doing so perhaps help underpin the union mandate.</p> <p>There is also an argument that the publication of the salaries, while potentially embarrassing for underperforming high earners and the people who pay them, can also be leveraged the other way. Mauro Rosales at Seattle had a breakout season in 2011 <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/May%201,%202011%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf\">on a league minimum wage of $42K</a>. He is back in 2012 as a designated player, albeit one whose basic wage, while much improved to a guaranteed $225,000, does not compare to other players in the league carrying the DP tag (his salary is significantly supplemented by a series of add-ons that keep the Sounders under the cap and Rosales happy not to have permanently undervalued himself with a poor year at the cut rate). </p> <p>Chris Wondolowski can also rely on a fair amount of local public opinion being behind him when he states his case that he should be a $1m-per-annum designated player next year, instead of earning the $300,000 that has bought San Jose 25-goals-and-counting this season. Wondolowski can also point to the very publicly documented years he spent as a development player for much less money and make a very reasonable case that in the limited window he has to make money for himself and his family, he is probably entering the last year to make such a deal for himself.</p> <p>But as the FIFPro delegates met in Washington to represent organized labor within the global game, they were at pains to emphasize that the point is not the more eye-catching individual salaries on offer \u2013 whether in the upper echelons of the English or Spanish leagues, or the comparatively modest outlays in the American game \u2013 but the collective bargaining power of players negotiating en masse, as the MLS Players Union did in 2004 (<a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/collective_bargaining_agreement__final.pdf\">full agreement here</a>) and 2010 to secure the collective bargaining agreements that secured healthcare and pension rights, and certain concessions on player movement.</p> <p>Also at the FIFPro conference, DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.nflplayers.com\">NFL Players Association</a>, and Michael Weiner, his <a href=\"http://mlbplayers.mlb.com/pa/index.jsp\">MLB equivalent</a>, had outlined their respective struggles towards their sports' CBAs in recent years. (Don Fehr, their NHL counterpart, was originally scheduled to appear but, ironically, he has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/04/nhl-lockout-league-cancels-two-weeks\">a lockout</a> to contend with.) </p> <p>The global delegates and observers, assembled from countries as diverse as Malta, Indonesia and Palestine, all had horror stories about organizing for the vast majority of players for whom multi-million dollar salaries are a pipe dream, but even they seemed to balk at some of the descriptions of the routine practices permitted under American labor law, such as the idea of the lockout as a standard \"technique\" of owners in the negotiating process. </p> <p>For Smith and the NFLPA <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/the-side/football-column/nfl-lockout-2011-issues-5471398\">the memories were recent and bruising</a>. For MLB's Weiner, the last decade's CBA negotiations have been a relatively straightforward process fueled by meticulous preparation of his members, starting two years out from negotiations, the significant fact that no salary cap exists in the league, and of course <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994\u201395_Major_League_Baseball_strike\">the bruising folk memory of the 232 day stoppage of 1994-95</a>, which fuels a current wary respect between owners and players. </p> <p>When I spoke last month to Todd Durbin, the MLS vice-president who has negotiated virtually every contract in MLS, he seemed to share such wary respect for his union counterparts, despite the memory of what had been a draining and emotional battle for all parties in working towards the last CBA, when <a href=\"http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/ussoccerplayers/2010/03/mls-announces-cba-changes.html\">the threat of a work stoppage was only narrowly averted</a>.</p> <p>\"When you're dealing with labor issues you're dealing with peoples' lives,\" he said. \"It's not like a commercial transaction, you're talking about creating an environment that everybody has to live in after the fact. So the goal is not to win, because you have to live with whatever it is you've built afterwards. So the goal is not for us to win, it's not for them to win, it's to build an environment that gives us the best chance to make the business successful. We're all sort of growing up together, and to [the players'] credit... they're smart and they're tough, but they have a genuine interest in building the business. And the players do as well, and they deserve a lot of credit.\"</p> <p>Durbin's is a much more sanguine take than some governing-body attitudes that were described at the FIFPro assembly \u2013 the power plays and \"choke out\" moves, as one speaker put it. Of course, the MLS model is structured on a sense of shared enterprise that can, eventually, be successfully appealed to in player/management negotiations, but that doesn't mean that the size and rights to that share are not a matter for continuous contestation, some of it extremely heated. </p> <p>With the next MLS CBA due to be negotiated in 2014, this period of mutual respect could yet come to look like a golden age in labor relations. Last week though, the players and the owners were in their huddles, separated by the Atlantic.</p>",

  "<p>There is a formula for the modern multiplayer first-person shooter that has very nearly been perfected. Key to this formula is the concept of unlockables, which can be anything from guns to masks or grenades to helicopters.</p> <p>What matters is that it takes hours, days or even weeks of play time to get your hands on them. That \u2013 as much as the visceral thrill of the fire-fight itself \u2013 is what keeps players coming back for more. Give us unlockables, a varied selection of maps and a good choice of game modes, and \u2013 provided you haven't done anything truly silly with the gameplay \u2013 we'll sign up for your war without a second thought.</p> <p>It's the success of this formula that's to blame \u2013 or to thank, if you prefer \u2013 for the current homogeneity of the genre. Compared with the numerous things they have in common, there's only a very limited set of differences between its standout titles, the Battlefield and Modern Warfare series. <strong>Medal of Honor: Warfighter</strong> (Xbox 360/PC/PS3/WiiU) \u2013 the sequel to 2010's franchise reboot Medal of Honor \u2013 stands somewhere in the narrow no man's land between the two. Built with the same engine as Battlefield 3, but refined to provide the faster, more arcade experience of a Modern Warfare, it's a hybrid hoping to capture the best of both. They might just as well have called it Medal of Honor: Modern Field. Although that does sound more like a game aimed at gentleman farmers.</p> <p>Call it what you will, Warfighter contains every ingredient of the trusted formula, and in generous quantities. Take, for example, unlockables. Play online and the first thing you'll unlock are the game's six classes: Assault, Sniper, Demolitions, Point Man, Heavy Gunner and Spec Ops, each of which has its own unique piece of kit, called a Class Ability.</p> <p>Some of which, it has to be said, are a lot better than others: while the Assault class gets its very own grenade launcher to send explosives flying across the battlefield, the Sniper class gets a bi-pod. You know, to rest his rifle on, so his ickle arms don't get too tired.</p> <p>The freedom to customise extends far beyond the classes. Players can choose their avatar \u2013 again, after unlocking them \u2013 from 12 different national special forces, including Russians, Brits, Canadians, Aussies and South Koreans, each with its own distinctive appearance, voice and arsenal.</p> <p>There is also, of course, the formula's obligatory weapon modification: the optics, barrel assembly, muzzle, grip and magazine style can all be fiddled with, for the killing machine of the player's dreams.</p> <p>You name the box, it's ticked: variety is ensured with a healthy array of game modes, from the no-respawn intensity of Home Run to epic, drawn-out assault and defence missions. There's even a little innovation in the game's approach to kill-streak rewards (for the uninitiated: things like helicopters and mortars that you get to call in when you're doing well).</p> <p>Alongside the usual plethora of fiery apocalypses, there are also defensive options: if you need to take an objective you can forego an air strike and instead request a smoke screen.</p> <p>The most significant innovation, though, is the age-old buddy system. In multiplayer games, each team is sub-divided into pairs called Fire Teams, who, if they cooperate, have quite a few little tricks up their sleeves. They can heal each other when shot, resupply each other with ammo and respawn from one another's location when not in the heat of battle.</p> <p>Your buddy is also visible to you no matter where he is on the map, and can be seen as a coloured outline even on the other side of a wall. Get paired up with a good communicator and the Fire Team mechanic might just add whole new levels of tactical depth.</p> <p>Other nice touches, such as the ability to slide round a corner while sprinting, and gritty, class-specific melee kills, also look like positive tweaks to the recipe.</p> <p>It's not yet clear how far the single-player campaign strays from the generic, but a pure driving level set in the slums of Karachi showed an impressive level of detail and invention, and the story seems a little less apocalyptic than is usual, finding space for the occasional insight into the soldiers' home lives.</p> <p>They haven't messed much with the genre's success, but why should they? This is first-person shooting done right, by the book, with just enough new tricks to be called an evolution.</p>",

While actual proposed legislation seems not to involve compulsion, political tolerance of retail profits is dwindling. </blockquote> <p>They suggest there would be limited scope for customer switching in the new regime, which could hit margins at energy companies.</p> <blockquote> If regulation replaces competition to control margins, allowed profits could be squeezed given the very limited capital involved in retailing. </blockquote> <p>The companies most at risk from this are Centrica and SSE, they say, rating both of the stocks a 'hold.

  "<p><em>This week's playlist has been selected by Chris Bishop.</em></p> <p>Given that they account for 40% of all animal species and inhabit every continent bar Antarctica (thank you, popular web-based encyclopedia), it's hardly surprising that rodents have inspired multitudes of musicians over the years. So how do we feel about the furry little critters? Do we love 'em or loathe 'em?</p> <p>Well, rats \u2013 far and away the most musically inspirational of rodents, if RR nominations are anything to go by \u2013 get a rather bad rap. (And no, this isn't about Roland.) Spreaders of plague, vicious vermin, filthy scavengers \u2026 <strong>Sleepy John Estes</strong> is feeling so blue about the mean ones in his kitchen pinching his groceries that he's ordered him a mountain cat. \"Eek!\" I hear you (and them) cry. And <strong>Big Mama Thornton</strong> menacingly vows to find the trail of the black rat who's done her wrong. Things aren't looking good for rodent-human relations. </p> <p>But hallelujah! Other musicians come here not to bury rodents but to praise them: in <strong>Rats</strong>, <strong>Pearl Jam's</strong> Eddie Vedder lists the many evils anthropomorphically attributed to them by us humans, the genuine culprits. \"Ben, the two of us need look no more,\" he moans over the song's outtro, referencing pop's most famous rat-fan. Take that, Big Mama and Sleepy John! Rats can be our friends!<strong> Mark Eitzel</strong> certainly thinks so. <strong>My Pet Rat St Michael</strong> finds him imploring the doctor to help his depressed pet. Even Mariah Carey records can't cheer the little fella up. Imagine that.</p> <p>Maybe Mark should have taken St Michael to see <strong>Jilted John's</strong> doc, who recommends that he take up a hobby to distract him from his acne-based teen angst \u2013 perhaps breeding fancy mice would do the trick? We humans are clearly fonder of the smaller members of the muroid family (that's mice to you and me). In a song based on the Daniel Keyes sci-fi tale, <strong>Kathy Mar's</strong> protagonist touchingly eulogises a particularly fancy laboratory mouse, Algernon \u2013 possessor of super rodent intelligence and beloved friend.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Louis Armstrong </strong>and <strong>Louis Jordan</strong> jazzily celebrate a couple of less domesticated rodents: a rambling muskrat and an industrious squirrel (and his missus) respectively. Nuts to you, rodent-haters! Taking a ramble towards some less popular rodents (at least among musicians), we come across the capybara, the largest extant member of the family with \"a roly-poly body shape\" and \"two round ebony eyes\", as <strong>Shonen Knife </strong> inform us. \"Try to live our life like capybara,\" they chirpily urge. \"You don't need to be greedy.\" It's not just rats whose morals and lifestyle are worth emulating, then. And who knew porcupines were rodents \u2013 and such wonderfully funky ones? Not me. And not RR contributor alexito, who had to look them up before<br>nominating <strong>Nature Zone's </strong><strong>Porcupine</strong>.</p> <p><strong>King Missile</strong> are clearly fans of rodents too \u2013 as accessories at least. In <strong>Hamsters</strong>, they provide helpful advice on the numerous potential faux pas involved in jazzing up one's belt with balloons and, yes, hamsters. Apparently, the vital thing is to \"radiate an aura of control\". And finally, <strong>Stephen Lynch </strong>is another rodent-lover. <strong>Gerbils</strong>, in his case. If only he didn't love them in such a wrong way \u2026 </p> <p>Maybe rats don't have it so bad after all.</p> <h2>The list:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De2kwEAGDIM\">Sleepy John Estes \u2013 Rat in my Kitchen</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3afPJsdTxs\">Big Mama Thornton \u2013 One Black Rat</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGRCqPzfluU\">Pearl Jam \u2013 Rats</a><br><a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/#!/search/song?q=Mark+Eitzel+My+Pet+Rat+St+Michael\">Mark Eitzel \u2013 My Pet Rat St Michae</a>l<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2xzYSG7jmE\">Jilted John \u2013 Fancy Mice</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJQFS0_mSzE\">Kathy Mar \u2013 Flowers for Algernon</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoEtrHPUN_I\">Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five \u2013 Muskrat Ramble</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjwAuAlZC0\">Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five \u2013 Two Little Squirrels</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDbnOVO9TI\">Shonen Knife \u2013 Capybara</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2rWmkurgyc\"><br>Nature Zone \u2013 Porcupine</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjZjvEnRgTM\">King Missile \u2013 Hamsters</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxTErqq73ys\">Stephen Lynch \u2013 Gerbil</a></p> <p>\u2022 Listen to these songs on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De2kwEAGDIM&amp;list=PLmiWEZIIdhkaPAkQR67QvNZtsSUo1s5Up&amp;feature=plpp_play_all\">YouTube playlist</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 See all the readers' recommendations on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/oct/11/readers-recommend-songs-about-rodents\">last week's blog</a>, from which Chris selected the songs above.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:2KiMCJvSo47nrBGeGP3SAC\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:2KiMCJvSo47nrBGeGP3SAC\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"540\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:2KiMCJvSo47nrBGeGP3SAC\">Reading this on mobile?

  "<p>Kang Il-chul was 16 when Japanese military police arrived at her home in South Korea and told her she was being conscripted. The year was 1943, and her country was just two years away from liberation after 35 years of brutal Japanese colonial rule.</p> <p>Kang spent the remainder of the war in occupied China, as one of tens of thousands of Asian women forced to have sex with Japanese soldiers in frontline, makeshift brothels. \"I was put in a tiny room and made to sleep with about 10 to 20 soldiers a day,\" says Kang, pausing to display the scars on her head \u2013 the result of frequent beatings by the military police. \"I was punched and beaten so much that my body was covered in bruises. I still get headaches.\"</p> <p>Almost 70 years after Japan's defeat, the treatment of such \"comfort women\" still haunts its relations with South Korea as the region, embroiled in long-standing territorial disputes, once again confronts the legacy of Japanese militarism. Lingering resentment over atrocities committed during the second world war \u2013 and the perception that Japan has failed to show enough remorse for its actions \u2013 help explain the periodical outbreaks of anti-Japanese rage in the region, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/japanese-mps-war-shrine-china-korea\" title=\"\">angry reactions to high-profile visits to Yasukuni, the controversial war shrine in Tokyo</a>.</p> <p>\"Historical grievances in Korea do not depend on who is in charge in Japan,\" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. \"They simmer on and on until every once in a while they boil over. Tokyo is living in a dream world if it believes that these matters are resolved and not worth addressing,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this week, South Korea repeated its demand that Japan acknowledge its use of former sex slaves and compensate them. \"Japan's legal responsibility has not been settled,\" the country's deputy chief envoy to the UN, Shin Dong-ik, told a UN committee. \"Those acts were a crime against humanity.\"</p> <p>Those grievances came to the fore again recently when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/south-korea-japan-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, made a politically charged trip</a> to Dokdo \u2013 a pair of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/18/japan-south-korea-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">remote, rocky islands also claimed by Japan</a>, where they are known as Takeshima. The visit was not just intended to demonstrate his country's de facto control over the territory. Lee linked his visit to Tokyo's failure to apologise for the use of sex slaves, and challenged Japan's emperor, Akihito, to issue a mea culpa on the country's behalf.</p> <p>Japan retaliated last week by deciding <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/uk-korea-japan-swap-idUKBRE89805W20121009\" title=\"\">not to renew a $57bn (\u00a335.5bn) currency swap with South Korea</a> \u2013 a measure designed to protect both countries against financial crisis \u2013 although officials in Seoul and Tokyo said the decision was made on economic grounds and the territorial dispute was not a factor.</p> <p>Lee's remarks were in part a vote-winning exercise for his conservative Saenuri party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/park-geun-hye-korean-president\" title=\"\">before December's presidential election</a>, but also proof that wartime history still weighs heavily on the South Korean national psyche \u2013 and finds voice in an enduring suspicion of Japan.</p> <p>There is disagreement on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/14/worlddispatch.secondworldwar\" title=\"\">exact number of women forced into prostitution by Japan</a>. Campaigners believe between 50,000 and 200,000 women \u2013 mostly Koreans, but also Chinese, south-east Asians and a small number of Japanese and Europeans \u2013 were forced or tricked into working in military brothels between 1932 and 1945.</p> <p>Fearing ostracism in their own countries, most took their secret to the grave. But in 1991, Kim Hak-soon, a South Korean, became the first to testify about her wartime forced prostitution experiences in public. \"We must record these sins that were forced upon us,\" she said.</p> <p>Since then, more than 230 women have identified themselves as former sex slaves. Only about 60 are still alive. Eight, including Kang, live at the <a href=\"http://www.nanum.org/eng\" title=\"\">House of Sharing,</a> a facility that opened in 1992 in the hills south of Seoul.</p> <p>The women, most of whom are in their 80s and 90s, say they have yet to receive an official apology or compensation from Japan over their treatment.</p> <p>The Japanese government initially denied the existence of \"comfort stations\", as the brothels were known. But in 1993 Yohei Kono, the-then chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged and apologised for the first time for Japan's use of sex slaves during the second world war.</p> <p>Japan refused to directly compensate the women, saying all claims were settled by postwar peace treaties. In 1995 it set up the privately run <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Women%E2%80%99s_Fund\" title=\"\">Asian women's fund</a>, which drew on donations, but many women rejected any redress unless it came directly from the Japanese state. The fund was disbanded in 2007.</p> <p>Kono's statement infuriated Japanese conservatives. They recently gained an ally in the country's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/30/japan-yoshihiko-noda-prime-minister\" title=\"\">supposedly progressive prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda</a>, who, despite conceding that individual testimony indicated the coercion of Asian women into sexual slavery, claimed no documentary evidence existed.</p> <p>His main opponent in the next general election, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/japanese-nationalist-tipped-pm-china\" title=\"\">Liberal Democratic party leader, Shinzo Abe</a>, has even called for the Kono statement to be revised.</p> <p>The spread of frontline brothels followed the Japanese imperial army's sweep through large parts of China and south-east Asia. As colonial ruler of the Korean peninsula since 1910, Japan had easy access to local women, targeting poor, uneducated and single females aged between 13 and 19.</p> <p>On display in a museum near the women's residence are photographs, documents and exhibits that shed light on their wretched existence before they were abandoned by fleeing Japanese troops at the end of the war.</p> <p>Typically, they were forced to have sex with 10 to 30 men a day in dimly lit rooms furnished only with beds. Condoms were washed and re-used and offered little protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Medical examinations were infrequent, and many women became addicted to the mercury 606 used to treat syphilis. Forced abortions were commonplace.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the Japanese comprise about two-thirds of the estimated 15,000 people who visit the House of Sharing every year. In the past, the residents were happy to meet members of the public, but in recent weeks some have refused to talk to Japanese visitors. \"They wonder why Japanese visitors don't go home and tell everyone the truth about the comfort women,\" said a Japanese member of staff who did not wish to be named.</p> <p>After the war, Kang settled in north-west China where she married a local man and worked as a nurse. She did not return to South Korea until 2000, and these days speaks her native tongue with a heavy Chinese accent.</p> <p>She and other former comfort women have maintained pressure on Japan during weekly demonstrations outside its embassy in Seoul. Last December they conducted their 1,000th protest.</p> <p>The 85-year-old, who was given the Japanese name Tamako Okada while working in military brothels, said Japan's recent backpedalling would only prolong the agony of former sex slaves. \"To hear Japan's leaders accuse us of being liars makes me sad and angry,\" she said. \"I have nothing against ordinary Japanese people. This is their government's fault. The prime minister says there is no proof that we existed. But I am living proof.\"</p> <h2>Japan's war apologies</h2> <p>Earlier this month, a large billboard appeared in Times Square in New York. Beneath the question, \"Do you remember?\" is a black-and-white photograph from 1971 of the former German chancellor Willy Brandt kneeling before a monument to victims of the Warsaw Uprising. That simple gesture, the signs says, \"promoted reconciliation in Europe\".</p> <p>It continues: \"In 2012, Korean women forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during WWII are still waiting for a heartfelt apology from Japan.\"</p> <p>Japan is often accused of never matching Germany's remorse for its wartime conduct. In fact, Japanese leaders, and its current emperor, have issued several apologies and expressed remorse. In addition to compensation agreed in postwar peace treaties, Japan points out that it has since extended generous aid and development packages to its former victims.</p> <p>On the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in 1995, the then socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, said: \"Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly those of Asia.</p> <p>\"In the hope that no such mistake will be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humanity, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.\"</p> <p>Two years earlier, Yohei Kono, then the chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged that the Japanese military had coerced Asian women into sexual slavery.</p> <p>The Kono statement, according to a recent editorial in the Korean press, deserves praise for \"extending its sincere apologies and remorse to all those who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women\".</p> <p>But it is the nature, and perceived insincerity, of the apologies that continues to trouble China and South Korea.</p> <p>For the 60 or so surviving comfort women, previous expressions of remorse do not go far enough; instead, they are demanding an official apology and compensation directly from the Japanese government.</p> <p>In 2007, they won support from the US House of Representatives, which passed a resolution urging Japan to \"formally acknowledge, apologise, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner\" for the coercion of young women into sexual slavery.</p> <p>Demands for a formal apology and compensation will continue, at least as long as Japan, in Lee Myung-bak's words, refuses to summon the \"courage and wisdom to look squarely at history\".</p>",
  "<p>The Christian owner of a bed and breakfast has been ordered to pay damages after a court found her refusal to let a gay couple stay in one of her double rooms amounted to direct discrimination and a breach of equality law.</p> <p>Michael Black and John Morgan brought a civil case against Susanne Wilkinson, who owns the Swiss Bed and Breakfast in Cookham, Berkshire, after they were refused accommodation at the premises in March 2010 despite having made a reservation and paid a deposit.</p> <p>In a verdict delivered on Thursday by recorder Claire Moulder at Reading county court, Wilkinson was ordered to pay \u00a33,600 in damages to the couple, who said they were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/21/gay-couple-refused-hotel-room\" title=\"\">shocked and embarrassed</a> and felt \"like lepers\" after being told they were not welcome at the B&amp;B because their same-sex relationship was against the owner's convictions.</p> <p>The verdict found that Black and Morgan, from Brampton, Cambridgeshire, suffered direct discrimination by being turned away from the guesthouse because they were gay. Moulder said that by refusing the couple access, Wilkinson had \"treated them less favourably than she would treat unmarried heterosexual couples in the same circumstances\".</p> <p>In a statement, Wilkinson \u2013 whose legal defence was paid for by the Christian Institute, a national charity \u2013 said she was giving \"serious consideration\" to an appeal against the ruling.</p> <p>\"Naturally, my husband and I are disappointed to have lost the case and to have been ordered to pay \u00a33,600 in damages for injury to feelings. We have the option to appeal, and we will give that serious consideration. We believe a person should be free to act upon their sincere beliefs about marriage under their own roof without living in fear of the law. Equality laws have gone too far when they start to intrude into a family home.\"</p> <p>But the decision prompted relief among equality campaigners. James Welch, the legal director of Liberty, said: \"Liberty defends the rights of religious groups to manifest their beliefs, even when we disagree with them. But it is simply unacceptable for people running a business to refuse to provide a service because of someone's sexual orientation. Hopefully today's ruling signals the death knell of such 'no gays' policies \u2013 policies that would never be tolerated if they referred to a person's race, gender or religion.\"</p> <p>Lawyers for Wilkinson had argued that she was entitled to refuse double rooms not only to gay couples but also to couples who were not married or in a civil partnership. Black and Morgan are not in a civil partnership.</p> <p>But the judge found that although the refusal of a room could be seen as a manifestation of the owner's religious beliefs, her right to manifest those beliefs was not unfairly limited by the Equality Act of 2010, which requires that service providers do not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation.</p> <p>Wilkinson and her husband say they have received two years of abuse for the decision, which enraged gay rights campaigners but gave succour to some Christians' claims of persecution.</p> <p>In her statement, Susanne Wilkinson said: \"People's beliefs about marriage are coming under increasing attack, and I am concerned about people's freedom to speak and act upon these beliefs. I am a Christian, not just on a Sunday in church, but in every area of my life \u2013 as Jesus expects from his followers.</p> <p>\"That's all I was trying to do and I think it's quite wrong to punish me for that, especially after enduring over two years of vile abuse and threats. We find this a strange justice in a society that aspires to be increasingly tolerant.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of anti-abortion activists have gathered in the heart Belfast to protest at the opening of the first ever private abortion clinic on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>In driving rain, the demonstrators said prayers and waved placards with graphic images of aborted foetuses at the entrance to the new Marie Stopes clinic on Great Victoria Street.</p> <p>Some of them also tried to shout down a lone pro-choice demonstrator who held up her own placard with the words: \"Been in the situation? Only then does your opinion count.\"</p> <p>Danni Stanfield, a 21-year-old student from Belfast, said: \"Many of the people here today, who are pro-life, if they were in that situation themselves they might take a different point of view. I don't think many here today have come from the background where they have gone through abortions themselves.</p> <p>\"I am pro-choice but I had to come here and support the clinic. I am not saying to women who got pregnant unplanned that they should have an abortion, but rather that they be allowed that choice.\"</p> <p>She pointed out that the protesters have never been able to stop up to 1,000 women leaving Northern Ireland every year to have terminations in Britain. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply owing to opposition from the political parties at Stormont and all the main churches.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/80EqQK7TLmk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/80EqQK7TLmk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There was a heavy police presence alongside the anti-abortion activists at the Marie Stopes clinic, which has offered services including terminations for women who are up to nine weeks pregnant. A smaller number of anti-abortion campaigners were also packed into the front of Belfast Opera House, directly across the road.</p> <p>The clinic is based in the same building as the former Anglo Irish Bank, right in the heart of commercial Belfast.</p> <p>A white van bearing the slogan \"Abortion is Murder\" was driven continuously around central Belfast as some passing motorists beeped their horns in support.</p> <p>Ciara Coyle, who travelled from Derry to join the protest, said she believed abortion was wrong \"no matter what the circumstances\".</p> <p>Asked how she and her fellow anti-abortion activists could stop the clinic from operating, Coyle replied: \"Unfortunately all we can do is pray, to pray and to protest peacefully. To be in the streets. I just can't understand why our politicians and the likes of the health minister can't stop this already.\"</p> <p>She denied that there was a demand among women within Northern Ireland for abortion services. \"I do believe that Northern Ireland is a pro-life country, like the whole of Ireland, and we will continue to make our stand against this baby-killing clinic.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CkBpRq7ZE90?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CkBpRq7ZE90\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's attorney general has called for a Stormont investigation into the legality of the clinic's opening. John Larkin QC, chief law officer and adviser to the power-sharing government, said that while he cannot intervene he would be happy to give advice to the administration.</p> <p>Among those attending the protest were individuals and groups from the Irish Republic, where there is an absolute ban on abortion. They fear that the opening of the clinic, which will provide medical and not surgical terminations, will allow women from south of the border to travel to Northern Ireland for abortions in certain circumstances.</p> <p>Pro-choice campaigners plan to hold a rally in support of the Marie Stopes clinic on Thursday evening but intend to keep their distance from the anti-abortion activists.</p>",
  "<p>It's not quite \"What did you do in the war, Daddy?\" or even \"Where were you when Mary Berry <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/16/great-british-bake-off-john-whaite\" title=\"\">marvelled at a lovely sausage on the Great British Bake Off</a>?\" \u2013 but do you remember when Come Dine With Me was an afternoon treat? How we laughed at narrator Dave Lamb's caustic comments; marvelled at the delusions of the few competitors who couldn't throw a penny in a well, never mind a dinner party; delighted in deciphering the carefully-coded classifications of contestants. (For those wondering: \"party girl\" \u2013 will have sex for booze; \"bon viveur\" \u2013 ugly but wealthy, probably has gout; \"ladies' man\" \u2013 compulsive onanist and porn addict.) </p> <p>Back in 2005, Come Dine With Me was an undiscovered gem in Channel 4's daytime schedule. Now, alas, it seems like a gaudy commodity: broadcast a whopping 126 times in one month on Channel 4, More4 and 4Seven, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/come-dine-with-me-to-be-screen-126-on-channel-1382743\" title=\"\">the Mirror reports</a>, in a move that critics say is indicative of Channel 4's creative bankruptcy.</p> <p>While this may be over-egging the pudding somewhat \u2013 you might want to brace yourself for a whole lot more foodie puns \u2013 CDWM has bloomed like a beanstalk since it was first broadcast. Moving from daytime to compressed primetime and then to teatime, daytime <em>and</em> primetime, it has spawned More4 marathons, celebrity editions and merchandising. Not only one of the UK's most successful global formats, it has also inspired imitations and derivations: notably SkyLiving's Four Weddings and Channel 4's Four in a Bed. (We shall back away from The Devil's Dinner Party, like cats from vomit.)</p> <p>You can't blame Channel 4 for capitalising on the success of CDWM, with its simple premise \u2013 dinner parties are arenas in which petty competitiveness and small snobberies pervade proceedings \u2013 that has proven irresistible to viewers. The issue is one of extent: the show's ubiquity will surely lead audiences to sicken of it more quickly than if the channel had enforced strict portion control.</p> <p>But perhaps the show's real problem is the change in its recipe. It's not so much that we've had too many helpings of Come Dine With Me but rather that it's gone from appetiser to emetic.</p> <p>In its early days, the show was as much about the food as it was about the personalities involved. That Scottish man's pigs' trotters notwithstanding, there were a fair few recipes that you might have considered making. Now the food feels almost an afterthought to the inevitable rifling through folks' wardrobes for racy, lacey knickers; rummaging in bedside cabinets for the dildo drawer and laying on inevitably excruciating themed entertainment. (Let's not even start on the inexplicably high proportion of dinners that end in hot tubs).</p> <p>Downgrading the cooking in favour of increasingly tacky casting of self-consciously \"wacky\" people arguably has more to do with programme-makers becoming bored with the CDWM formula than viewers. Had the show remained unadulterated rather than packed full of additives such as shouty vegan strippers, I'd wager it would have a great deal more life left in it now.</p> <p>But whatever the problem \u2013 that we've gorged on it like geese on gavage or that its format has, like so much reality TV, fallen foul of the observer effect \u2013 there can't be anyone who imagines that the once tasty Come Dine With Me is not a flavour rapidly falling out of favour.</p>",
  "<p>Confusion over David Cameron's commitment to forcing energy companies to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/energy-tariff-plans-under-pressure\" title=\"\">place customers on their lowest tariffs</a> deepened on Thursday, with neither the energy secretary nor the energy minister able to explain its meaning.</p> <p>Instead, the climate and energy secretary, Ed Davey, pointed to a voluntary agreement brokered with energy companies in April to inform customers about cheaper tariffs. Asked whether the prime minister's pledge meant energy companies would only be able to offer one tariff \u2013 the cheapest \u2013 he said: \"[Ensuring] consumers face the lowest bills possible is a priority for me. We have been in discussions across government. Ofgem has been talking about fewer tariffs and simpler bills and that is the direction of travel.\"</p> <p>The Guardian can confirm that Davey knew nothing about Cameron's pledge before it was made.</p> <p>Energy minister John Hayes was summoned to the House of Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour. He was unable to confirm Cameron's announcement, instead saying the government would legislate to \"help\" get the best deal. \"There are a number of options that are being considered, for example [the April agreement] which will be evaluated to see if we should make legislation binding,\" Hayes told MPs. \"This is a complicated area and we will discuss it with the industry, consumer groups and the regulator in order to work through the detail.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he knew what was going to be announced, Hayes said: \"Of course we understand what the prime minister was considering because we have been debating and discussing the provisions of the energy bill for months.\"</p> <p>The shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said Cameron's intervention had thrown the government's policy into \"confusion\" and \"caused chaos\" in the industry.</p> <p>Neil Bentley, deputy director general of the CBI, which is urging the government to end its feud over energy policy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">back the green economy</a>, told the Guardian: \"We are seeking policy clarity like everybody else.

  "<p>Samsung did not copy Apple's iPad designs in building its Galaxy Tab product, the <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html\" title=\"\">court of appeal</a> ruled on Thursday, reinforcing an earlier decision in which a judge said the Korean company's designs were not as \"cool\".</p> <p>Apple will also be obliged to publicise the fact the two designs are different \u2013 a ruling handed down in July \u2013 in newspapers, magazines, and on its website. The three appeal court judges upheld that ruling, saying its purpose was not to \"punish [or] \u2026 make it grovel [but] to dispel commercial uncertainty.\"</p> <p>Apple had appealed against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/09/samsung-apple-cool-ipad-tablet\" title=\"\">decision in July</a> by Judge Colin Birss QC, who had decided Samsung's tablets didn't infringe Apple's registered design for the iPad: \"They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design,\" he said in <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/samsung-apple.pdf\" title=\"\">his judgment (PDF)</a>. \"They are not as cool.\"</p> <p>The appeal court judges agreed the contrasts in appearance and design between the two companies' products was sufficient that the \"informed user\" \u2013 the test applied in such cases \u2013 would think them different.</p> <p>The decision in the UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/25/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-trial\" title=\"\">matches that made by a jury</a> in the US, which decided that although some of Samsung's smartphone designs infringed Apple's iPhone designs, those of the Galaxy Tab tablets did not do so for the iPad.</p> <p>Apple's UK appeal was dismissed by Lord Justice Longmore, Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Robin Jacob.</p> <p>It is the latest round in an ongoing international legal battle between the two companies, which are the two biggest competitors in the smartphone market, even though Apple is Samsung's biggest customer for phone parts \u2013 and Samsung is Apple's biggest supplier.</p> <p>The three court of appeal judges also rejected Apple's challenge to an order made by Birss that it must publicise it had lost the case.</p> <p>Jacob said: \"The grant of such an order is not to punish the party concerned for its behaviour. Nor is it to make it grovel \u2013 simply to lose face. The test is whether there is a need to dispel commercial uncertainty.\"</p> <p>Ruling that an order was necessary, Jacob said Apple must make the position clear \"that it acknowledges that the court has decided that these Samsung products do not infringe its registered design. The acknowledgment must come from the horse's mouth. Nothing short of that will be sure to do the job completely\"</p> <p>Birss said in July: \"The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy tablets is the following: from the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. The overall impression produced is different.\"</p> <p>Apple had argued that the front face and overall shape were the most important factors because the \"informed user\" would spend the most time looking at the front and holding it.</p> <p>In Wednesday's ruling, Jacob said: \"Because this case (and parallel cases in other countries) has generated much publicity, it will avoid confusion to say what this case is about and not about.</p> <p>\"It is not about whether Samsung copied Apple's iPad. Infringement of a registered design does not involve any question of whether there was copying: the issue is simply whether the accused design is too close to the registered design according to the tests laid down in the law.\"</p> <p>He added: \"So this case is all about, and only about, Apple's registered design and the Samsung products.\"</p> <p>Samsung said in a statement: \"We welcome the court's judgment, which reaffirmed our position that our Galaxy Tab products do not infringe Apple's registered design right. We continue to believe that Apple was not the first to design a tablet with a rectangular shape and rounded corners and that the origins of Apple's registered design features can be found in numerous examples of prior art. Should Apple continue to make excessive legal claims in other countries based on such generic designs, innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited.\"</p> <p>Colin Fowler, a litigation lawyer with international IP law firm Rouse, said: '\"The publicity order is a first in such circumstances. The judge says that Apple could have avoided it had it not pressed ahead with legal action in Germany after the UK court's original EU-wide decision, and then publicised the interim injunction it obtained there.</p> <p>\"The court of appeal found that this will have caused commercial uncertainty in the market place and therefore the publicity order is necessary to clear up that confusion. The original provision has been watered down to some extent.

  "<p>The energy minister has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/video/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-policy-video\">fended off accusations of policy chaos</a> within government after being forced to admit that his department did not know in advance of David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/18/energy-tariff-plans-under-pressure\">surprise Commons announcement that energy firms would be forced by law to offer customers the cheapest tariffs.</a></p> <p>John Hayes, who joined the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) last month in the reshuffle, was summoned to the Commons to answer an urgent question tabled amid widespread speculation that the prime minister's announcement went further than a policy being prepared by the department.</p> <p>The shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, told Hayes that the prime minister had thrown energy policy into confusion, \"caused chaos in the energy industry and, I think I have to say, it left his own ministers at a loss over what government energy policy actually is\".</p> <p>She added: \"For the government to spend a day pretending they have a policy they have no intention of implementing is no way to run the country. It is like something out of the [spoof comedy] The Thick of It.\"</p> <p>In a half hour Q&amp;A session which prompted one Labour MP to accuse Hayes of \"linguistic acrobatics\", the energy minister fell short of confirming the pledge made by the prime minister on Wednesday as he told MPs that a \"number of options\" were being considered to \"get people lower tariffs\".</p> <p>Hayes said: \"Following the prime minister's announcement yesterday, I am pleased to confirm we will be bringing forward legislation to help energy consumers to get the best deal. We have already regulated and have plans to improve competition, simplifying tariffs through the retail market process, and we will improve liquidity and competition in the wholesale market through the energy bill in weeks rather than months. There are a number of options that are being considered. For example, a voluntary agreement with energy suppliers announced in April secured a number of measures which will be evaluated to see if we should make legislation binding.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he knew what was going to be announced by Cameron during prime minister's question time, Hayes said: \"Of course we understand what the prime minister was considering because we have been debating and discussing the provisions of the energy bill for months&#xa0;\u2026 So of course, all of these matters have been discussed and considered over the months.\"</p> <p>But pressed later by Labour's Chris Leslie on whether he was aware Cameron was going to make the announcement, the energy minister said: \"The prime minister comes to this house weekly to be scrutinised by this house. Does he give me notice of every answer, does he get notice of every question? The answer is no. But if he's asking me whether we were considering these matters, whether I was considering them, whether my secretary of state [Ed Davey] was considering them, whether they were being debated as part of the consideration of the bill&#xa0;\u2026 the answer is a definitive yes.\"</p> <p>Flint accused Cameron of \"making it up as he goes along\".</p> <p>\"Millions of our pensioners wondering how they will heat their homes deserve better than policy made on the hoof,\" she said.</p>",

She looks at the issues faced by those with fluctuating conditions, and the pressure she feels to conceal the good days (\"...days that are amazing. Days when I can walk to and then around my local park, watching kids play and parents shout at them. When I can touch trees and feel grass between my toes if I take my shoes off.\") And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I refuse to buy in to this Atos-inspired way of thinking. I won't accept that I should wallow in my disease and take to my bed for ever more so that they'll give me a fairly small amount of money every week and allow me to keep my blue badge. What kind of a society is this that this Coalition is building? A society where those of us who are sick or disabled should be defined by those things? I will not do it. I'm not going to play. I'm going to carry on celebrating my good days ... I will continue to cherish going out and having coffees and lunches with friends; I will carry on getting stupidly excited about using public transport and marvelling at the Oyster card system. I'm still going to get a buzz out of walking to the corner shop just a couple of hundred yards from my house \u2013 I say walking, it may look like that from the outside but in my heart it's still so much of a novelty for me that I feel like I'm flying to the local Londis. After a couple of decades of not being able to do those things at all, I'm grabbing my right to love doing them with both hands and anybody who thinks I should do otherwise can go join the Tory party. <br>Is Atos really going to punish us for doing this? For trying to be well and 'normal', instead of sick and crippled and downtrodden? Is this what Cameron's big society wants from those of us who aren't completely able-bodied? Because if it is, there's something far more rotten and insidious going on than anybody is admitting to, and certainly there's more than enough horrors that we already know about. Like an inverse Robin Hood, this government is taking from the poorest and weakest and giving to the rich fat cats, and how can that be right? This isn't meant to be a rant about government, though I suppose that's an inevitable by-product; it's meant to be a spleen-vent about the impotence forced upon those of us who just want to work and have that bit extra we need to live on, so that we can. Those of us who want to be well and functional and a useful part of society. Most of us, really, when you think about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Police blogger Mental Health Cop on this week's edition of Channel 4 series <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/999-whats-your-emergency/4od#3421247\" title=\"\">999 What's Your Emergency?</a>. The series follows police, fire and ambulance teams in Blackpool and this week looked at the issue of <strong>mental health</strong>. Inspector Michael Brown, who writes the blog, notes that call handler in the programme used terms like \"fruitloop\", and adds \"I could do without hearing \"These people\" to refer to everyone (in the country or the world?!) with mental health problems.\" <a href=\"http://mentalhealthcop.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/999-whats-your-emergency/\" title=\"\">Mental ill-health incidents are core police business</a>, says Brown, but there is a bigger issue: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Policing is only necessary at all because some people don't self-police. The existence of an alcohol industry and many of our fellow subjects' inability to drink and behave responsibly forces untold costs upon the public purse and causes mass demand for policing and emergency medical services. We're not banning pubs or alcohol, though, are we? We're not talking in terms of locking up drunken offenders for inordinate periods to ensure they are not free to drink again next weekend. Yet more harm and cost is caused to our society from drunk young men and, increasingly, women.<br>Why not just lock up all of \"these people\"? \u2013 is it because we, ourselves, along with most people are or have been in this group and we know general labels around alcohol related violence and disorder do not apply to us?! &lt;&lt; Stigma in operation. We do actually know that the relationship between alcohol and crime is far more direct than the links between mental illness and crime and that the costs \u2013 measured in lives lost and money \u2013 are far greater.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19989350\" title=\"\">Crime in England and Wales falls</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/fundraising/blogs/content/13586/gift_aid_small_donations_scheme_is_no_gift_for_small_charities\" title=\"\">Gift aid small donations scheme is no gift for small charities</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/blogs/childrens-services-blog/2012/10/why-governments-adoption-consultation-is-naive-old-fashioned-and-laughable.html\" title=\"\">Why the government's adoption consultation is 'naive', 'old fashioned' and 'laughable'</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/tenancies/council-offers-tenants-%C2%A325000-to-downsize/6524251.article\" title=\"\">Council offers tenants \u00a325,000 to downsize</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/10/cipfa-hits-out-at-u-turn-on-council-tax-benefit/\" title=\"\">CIPFA hits out at U-turn on Council Tax Benefit</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9615709/Statistical-illiteracy-leaves-citizens-at-risk-of-being-duped-by-politicians-and-businessmen-warns-British-Academy.html\" title=\"\">'Statistical illiteracy' leaves citizens at risk of being duped</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1155260/hmrc-reveals-foiled-fraudster-tried-set-189-charities/\" title=\"\">HMRC reveals it foiled fraudster who tried to set up 189 charities</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>\"I decided to be free,\" Orlando Cruz says with piercing clarity as he looks out across his home city of San Juan. The Puerto Rican fighter, who this month became the first boxer to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIfsadmP7BU\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIfsadmP7BU\">declare publicly that he was gay</a>, remains on the balcony of his condominium as a blue and humid sky darkens. Cruz ignores the drops of rain that glisten on his bare torso as he whistles to Bam-Bam, a cheerful sausage dog who jumps on to his lap. The 31-year-old then talks with increasing passion about his new-found liberty.</p> <p>\"They can call me <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/article/1258218--was-yunel-escobar-s-face-painted-with-a-homophobic-slur-not-so-fast\" title=\"http://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/article/1258218--was-yunel-escobar-s-face-painted-with-a-homophobic-slur-not-so-fast\"><em>maric\u00f3n</em></a>, or faggot,\" he says with a wry smile as he tickles Bam-Bam behind the ears, \"and I don't care. Let them say it because they can't hurt me now. I am relaxed. I feel so happy. But to make this announcement to the whole world I had to be very strong.\"</p> <p>Cruz flexes his tattooed arms while deflecting Bam-Bam's urge to lick his face. He might usually be besotted with his little dachshund but, now, Cruz is fiercely concentrated. On Friday night, in Kissimmee, Florida, he faces the most testing bout of his career, a WBO world featherweight title eliminator, but he needs first to explain the far harder struggle he has finally won over fear and prejudice.</p> <p>\"I have done well as a boxer,\" he continues before switching to Spanish so he might speak more evocatively. \"I've only lost two of <a href=\"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=93086&amp;cat=boxer\" title=\"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=93086cat=boxer\">my 21 fights</a>. I won those other fights but, all this time, I have been living with this thorn inside me. I wanted to take it out of me so I could have peace within myself.\"</p> <p>Cruz glances down and it's easy to imagine him searching for an invisible wound. \"You can't see it,\" he says of his hurt, \"but it was here.\"</p> <p>He taps his heart and recalls his bleakest moment. \"People have died because of this,\" he says as he details the murderous aspects of homophobia on the lush and sweltering <a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/06/puerto_rico.html\" title=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/06/puerto_rico.html\">island he loves</a>. \"I am proud to be Puerto Rican, just like I am proud to be a gay man. But I was sad and angry a long time because there are two doors to death over this one issue. There is suicidal death \u2013 when a gay man cannot stand being unaccepted and takes his own life. And there is homophobic murder. In both these situations I want to be a force for change.\"</p> <p>Cruz is such a warm and friendly man, and an unassuming fighter, that these words carry a jolting impact. He makes it sound as if he has personal experience of tragedy. \"Si, si,\" he murmurs. \"I lost one friend who was murdered by people who hated gay men. I was very angry then because homophobia ended his life in the most violent way. But I was also angry because, at the time, I was hiding this secret of mine.\"</p> <p>The rain falls harder and Cruz stands up, almost reluctantly, as if not wishing to break the spell of his confession. \"Let's go inside or we will look crazy \u2013 sitting in the rain.\" He gathers his boxing paraphernalia \u2013 scooping up the gloves and headguards, his trunks and socks \u2013 and ushers us inside the condo.</p> <p>Cruz sits on his kitchen worktop. He cannot quite believe how his life has changed in the last few blurring days. \"It's emotional for me, but I am also excited. I think I can be an example for people who are in the same position. I have received letters from people saying they have been afraid to come out of the closet because of what their families might think of them. Now, they say, I have given them courage.\"</p> <p>He looks still more moved when asked who helped him find the bravery he needed to tell the world the truth about himself. \"One person is very important to me. I've known him four-and-a-half years and he taught me to value myself. I won't say his name but he is like my angel. We discussed this whole situation and he told me about the positive impact it would have for me. In boxing it has been great and, in Puerto Rico, the reaction has been 90% good. So I owe him a lot.\"</p> <p>Cruz might say that one word, \"angel\", in English, but he shakes his head when asked if he's thinking of his partner? \"No. We separated but we still have this closeness. I am on my own now and he always tells me to focus on boxing. He's a good guy and he'll be at the fight in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id2QQpBump8\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id2QQpBump8\">Kissimmee on Friday</a>.\"</p> <p>Kissimmee might sound a sweetly coy name for a gay fighter called Cruz to make his first appearance in the ring as a self-confessed homosexual. But boxing's brutal undertow cannot be forgotten. While Bam-Bam crunches his dog biscuits and laps noisily from his water bowl, Cruz licks his own dry lips. Boiling down to the 126lb featherweight limit, and only days from fighting <a href=\"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=446080&amp;cat=boxer\" title=\"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=446080cat=boxer\">Jorge Pazos</a>, a durable and still ambitious Mexican, Cruz has to ration every morsel of food. And, despite his raging thirst, he'll soon step into the rustling sweatsuit that will help him shed more ounces during afternoon training.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397955483\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350552459665/Cruz-poses-with-his-dog-B-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cruz poses with his dog Bam Bam for a portrait in his apartment at Carolina Puerto Rico\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cruz poses with his dog Bam-Bam for a portrait in his apartment at Carolina Puerto Rico. Photograph: Herminio Rodriguez for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herminio Rodriguez/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruz's life has been turned inside out by his revelation and it seems strange that he should have invited such scrutiny so close to a fight of this magnitude for him. If he wins on Friday his hopes of fighting the world's best featherweight, the WBO world champion, <a href=\"http://www.wboboxing.com/orlando-salido/\" title=\"http://www.wboboxing.com/orlando-salido/\">Orlando Salido</a>, will feel deliciously close to fruition. But a loss to Pazos would be disastrous. Was it difficult to come out so close to an important fight?</p> <p>\"No,\" Cruz says. \"I wanted the whole world to know the truth about me. I have been a professional fighter for 12 years [having made his paid debut with a first round knockout win in December 2000] and I have been hiding this secret all that time. Now there is no secret. There is only the truth. Believe me: that means there is so much less pressure on me. It is so much better. I have been thinking about this moment for 11 years. All the time I was fighting and thinking when would be the best time to show my real self. It started in 2001 when I told my parents.\"</p> <p>Cruz laughs as a way of easing his emotions. \"You should have seen me,\" he says, remembering the moment he told his mother he was gay. \"I was crying! She was crying! I am emotional and I am so close to my mother. She said: 'It doesn't matter. You are my son. I love you.' That made me cry some more.\"</p> <p>Cruz pauses before addressing his father's reaction. He sighs, his breath leaving him in a muted hiss of resignation. \"My dad is more difficult because of the macho thing. Now, it's better. He supports me but\u2026 there is always a 'but'...\"</p> <p>The fighter raises his eyes and there is no need for him to explain more. \"My parents are separated. My dad lives in Miami but I'm glad he will be at the fight to support me. And my mother and I will fly together to Orlando. She was always more sympathetic \u2013 she's a special friend. And my sister and brother are the same. They have been great. They have all known for a long time.\"</p> <p>His phone rings repeatedly but Cruz has been so engrossed that he waves dismissively at it. Eventually he picks it up on the caller's fourth try. \"Oh,\" Cruz says in English, looking at his phone in surprise. \"It's my trainer. The two o'clock call\u2026\"</p> <p>On a public holiday in Puerto Rico, Cruz's usual gym has been shut for the day. Yet he had still set his alarm for 4.30 that morning. Thirty minutes later he had slipped out into San Juan's sultry blackness. What did he think about on his long and lonely 5am run? \"I thought about the fight against Pazos. October 19 holds my future because if I win then the next fight is for the world title. So I go through the fight in my head, round by round, and I see myself knocking him out.</p> <p>\"Sometimes my team runs with me. But this morning it was just me. I had the space to think about everything. I moved to New Jersey two years ago because my manager wanted me to get disciplined. There are too many distractions in Puerto Rico. And when I was in New Jersey I started the psychological process of being able to come out.\"</p> <p>Cruz seems briefly pensive as he charts the arduous journey he has taken to reach this point of release. \"After a while the psychiatrists say: 'Are you ready?' I say: No, not yet.' A few months later they ask the same question. I shake my head. I was nervous a long time because it's a big step to be the first in history. Even six months ago I was worried how people would take it. I had to wait until I was physically and emotionally prepared.</p> <p>\"It was still a big surprise to a lot of people in boxing. But the response was good. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIIGqR8fB9s\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIIGqR8fB9s\">Miguel Cotto</a> [the great Puerto Rican light-middleweight who is the same age as Cruz and his former team-mate on the national amateur team] <a href=\"http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/10/8/3473288/miguel-cotto-orlando-cruz-gay-boxer-boxing-news\" title=\"http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/10/8/3473288/miguel-cotto-orlando-cruz-gay-boxer-boxing-news\">said some beautiful things</a> in support of me. Miguel suspected I was gay but I could never discuss it with him. But I always knew Miguel would support me. I never doubted that.\"</p> <p>Does Cruz believe that his coming out will help other gay boxers follow the same path? \"I don't know. Probably in other sports it will happen. But boxing will still be difficult because it is so macho.\"</p> <p>Cruz's face grows sombre and he nods when asked if he knows the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/sports/emile-griffith-benny-paret-and-the-fatal-fight.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_moc.semityn.www&amp;_r=0\" title=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/sports/emile-griffith-benny-paret-and-the-fatal-fight.html?pagewanted=all_moc.semityn.www_r=0\">tragic story of Emile Griffith and Benny Paret</a>. \"Of course,\" he says. Fifty years ago, in April 1962, at the weigh-in before their third bout in a bitterly ferocious series, <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1073656/index.htm\" title=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1073656/index.htm\">Paret taunted Griffith</a> as a <em>maric\u00f3n</em>. Griffith beat up Paret so badly that the Cuban welterweight was reduced to a punching bag in the 12th round \u2013 absorbing 29 unanswered blows. Paret fell into a coma and died 10 days later. Griffith was haunted for decades afterwards.</p> <p>\"Griffith was gay,\" Cruz says, \"but he could not do what I did. It was only years later he could admit to being <a href=\" http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/magazine/04/12/griffith0418/\" title=\" http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/magazine/04/12/griffith0418/\">bisexual</a>. I understand.\"</p> <p>Cruz listens intently while I read a quote from Griffith \u2013 who said these words before he succumbed to dementia: \"I kill a man and most people forgive me. However, I love a man and many say this makes me an evil person.\"</p> <p>He sinks back into his chair, a strange expression flitting across his face. \"It shows the hypocrisy of the world,\" he murmurs in Spanish. \"He probably wanted to say those words 50 years ago but he was not living in the moment we are now. He was not as lucky as me.\"</p> <p>Cruz carries a sense of boxing history inside him and cites Muhammad Ali as his favourite fighter. He covers his face in embarrassment when I suggest that, in his own humble way, he has made the kind of history that usually belongs to fighters as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9TwvGYcGRo\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9TwvGYcGRo\">monumental as Ali</a>. Cruz has not risked jail, like Ali did in refusing to serve in the US Army in Vietnam, but he has broken the last great taboo in boxing.</p> <p>\"Thank you,\" he says before lightening the moment with a quip. \"Even women here in Puerto Rico were surprised. They used to say to me: 'Oh, you are beautiful!' Now they say: 'Oh my God! You are gay! I'm sorry!' But they accept it. They are still nice and warm.\"</p> <p>When did Cruz realise he was gay? \"Before the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney I tried to deny it to myself. I dated girls as a straight man. I had sex with girls. It was only after I came back from the Olympics that something changed inside me and I took another path. But, still, I didn't want to accept the truth about myself. It's been a long, painful journey.\"</p> <p>At the sound of his doorbell Cruz jumps up. \"You're going to meet my father-in-law,\" he says. Jim Pag\u00e1n is a <a href=\"http://proboxinginsider.com/gym-profile-gimnasio-parcelas-falu-in-rio-piedras-puerto-rico/\" title=\"http://proboxinginsider.com/gym-profile-gimnasio-parcelas-falu-in-rio-piedras-puerto-rico/\">veteran of the ring</a>, having trained Puerto Rican fighters like <a href=\"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=7813&amp;cat=boxer\" title=\"http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=7813cat=boxer\">Eric Morel</a> and Cruz for years, and he arrives at the condo with a weathered face and a quiet gravitas. Cruz tells me how Pag\u00e1n, who speaks little English, has trained him since he was seven years old. \"Twenty-four years,\" Cruz exclaims, as he reflects on their bond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397955484\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350552604400/Cruz-jumps-rope-during-hi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cruz jumps rope during his training prior to his fight with Orlando Salido\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cruz jumps rope during his training prior to his fight with Orlando Salido. Photograph: Herminio Rodriguez for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herminio Rodriguez/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another more emotive bond ties the two men together. \"I went out with Jim's daughter for five years,\" Cruz says. \"Her name is Daisy-Karen and she has supported me. Just like Jim.\"</p> <p>With Cruz acting as translator I ask the trainer how he feels now that his daughter's former boyfriend has come out as a gay man. \"We have great respect for each other,\" Pag\u00e1n says in soft but gravelly Spanish. \"I have always known Orlando is a very good person.\"</p> <p>Cruz laughs. \"Not always,\" he says, switching back into English. \"He once told me to fuck off and leave his gym. I had no discipline as a kid. But I always came back to him. He's my second father.\"</p> <p>Walking in tow with Pag\u00e1n's two young sons \u2013 one who hopes to become a professional fighter while the other dreams of playing baseball for a living \u2013 Cruz leads us to a gym at the far end of the complex. It is neat and clean and without any of the grit and stink of Pag\u00e1n's boxing gym in downtown San Juan.</p> <p>Inside, Cruz skips with a rope and then smacks his fists into Pag\u00e1n's raised pads. They make eerie shadows when silhouetted against the fading afternoon light; but the old tattooed beat of their pad-work calls up a shared and enduring love of boxing. Cruz is now just a fighter preparing for a dangerous battle.</p> <p>During a brief break, I ask if he feels nervous. \"Not yet,\" he says. \"The worst is two hours before the fight. Oh my God! Then there are big nerves. I go very quiet. But as soon as the knock comes on the locker-room door I am fine. And on Friday I will be ready.\"</p> <p>Once the fight is over, and he has hopefully secured his crack at Salido's world title, Cruz will party a little in Kissimmee. \"And then,\" he grins, \"I go to Disneyland in Orlando with my mom. She loves it.\"</p> <p>Cruz might get hurt or pushed to the edge of his ability against Pazos. Yet he insists that, after the greater struggle he has just won in real life, he will prevail in the ring. \"Pazos is a tough, typical Mexican fighter. We respect each other. When they asked him about me he says he doesn't care about my sexual preference. He knows I am a good fighter and that's his main concern. I am the same towards him. I keep my private and professional life separate but for one thing...\"</p> <p>Cruz looks up, his eyes shining in his sweat-streaked face. \"If I am inside or outside the ring I just want to be me. And, now, I'm happy I can do it. I can be true to myself.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'm the Seattle-based publisher of a <a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/\" title=\"\">network of lifestyle websites</a> read by roughly one million people each month. Almost all of our readers are women, most of them are educated and many of them are quite politically liberal. Because of this large, diverse and progressive readership, we deal with community issues that perhaps wouldn't be such a problem on smaller sites. And lately, I've started to notice a disturbing trend.</p> <p>Over the past couple of years, I've watched the rise of a new form of online performance art, where liberal internet commenters make public sport of flagging potentially problematic language as insensitive, and gleefully calling out authors as needing to \"check their privilege\" (admit their privileged position within society and its associated benefits).</p> <p>As a publisher serving readers who identify as both progressive and marginalised (in many different, varying ways), this issue is hugely important to me \u2013 I'm protective of the quality of debate on my sites. As a progressive myself, it's also complex and challenging because while I very much share the political values of the folks who engage in this kind of thing, I'm not on board with the tactics \u2013 which essentially amount to liberal bullying, and are way worse than anything I see from the conservatives who swing by my publications. The sad truth is that when it comes to the motivations behind this kind of commenting, it's basically the same as the GOD HATES FAGS guys \u2013 even though the values are the polar opposite.</p> <p><strong>Common trends in this online behaviour:</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Focus on very public complaints.</strong> I can think of exactly one time when someone emailed their concern about problematic language. These complaints seem to be always intended for an audience.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Lack of interest in a dialogue.</strong> These complaints aren't questions or invitations to discuss the issue. They're harshly worded accusations and scoldings (which I've written about before).</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Lack of consideration for the context or intent.</strong> The focus is on this isolated incident (this one post, this one word, this one time), with de-emphasis on the author's background, experience, or the context of the website on which the post appears.</p> <p>\u2022 And on a more stylistic note, these complaints are often prefaced with phrases like \"Um,\" and other condescending affectations.</p> <p>It's challenging for me because the values motivating these complaints are completely in line with both my personal politics and my professional passion for catering to niche markets and semi-marginalised cultures (I say \"semi-marginalised\" because let's get real here: readers of my websites are more likely to be a 20-something white plus-size roller derby player or an introverted 30-something information sciences grad student \u2013 neither of whom who are marginalised in the same way as, say, a gay Cambodian amputee immigrant living in Mexico City).</p> <p>Increasingly, I've started recognising this kind of behaviour for what it is: privilege-checking as a form of internet sport. It's a kind of trolling, with all the politics I agree with, but motivations and execution that turns my stomach. It's well-intended (<em>so</em> well-intended), but when the motivations seem to be less about opening dialogue about the issues, and more about performance, righteousness, and intolerance toward those who don't agree with you \u2026 well, I'm not on board.</p> <p>This is where it starts to feel like the \"GOD HATES FAGS!\" sign-wavers. While the political sentiments are exactly opposite, the motivations are remarkably similar: I WOULD LIKE TO DERAIL THIS CONVERSATION AND HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITNESS HOW RIGHT I AM. I don't care if your politics are progressive and your focus is on social justice: if you're shouting at people online and refusing to have a dialogue, you're bullying. I don't care if you're fighting the good fight: if you're fighting in a way that's more about public performance, shaming and righteousness, I'm not fighting with you.</p> <p>\u2026 Even if I agree with your goals.</p> <p>My big challenge is knowing how to respond to this kind of feedback, which comes in almost daily. Sometimes it feels like I have two options:</p> <p>\u2022 Acquiesce to every complaint of anyone anywhere on the internet, until we're putting trigger warnings at the top of posts that mention balloons because some people are globophobic (TRUE STORY!).</p> <p>\u2022 Align myself with insensitive assholes who defend their right to hate speech.</p> <p>Again, as a liberal I'm deeply conflicted about this issue. I love observing and following the ways that language shifts. It's exciting and fascinating to watch as the semantics of marginalised communities evolve. I recently had to talk to my ageing lesbian mother and her partner about how the word \"tranny\" causes a lot of issues for folks in the transgender community. My mothers are totally aligned with the cause and totally active in LGBT communities \u2026 they just hadn't got the latest memo.</p> <p>I'm totally on board with the reasoning behind shifting the language from \"illegal immigrants\" to \"undocumented immigrants.\" I get why the word \"gypsy\" is problematic. I've appreciated the lively discussions I've had with readers about words like \"<a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/2012/05/derp\" title=\"\">Derp</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/2011/10/word-tribe-racist\" title=\"\">Tribe</a>\" (because these were <em>discussions</em>. Dialogues).</p> <p>I love learning new things about how cultures are defining themselves. I love that people take the time to try to improve my publications by sharing the latest language that communities are using. I love that readers feel safe enough to voice their concerns. I love this shared concern for sensitivity around language. I love the social justice motivations, and the encouragement that we all be self-aware of how the language we use has powerful, sometime unexpected impacts on the people around us.</p> <p>BUT. But. Seriously, I'm just not down with:</p> <p>\u2022 The derailing of conversations to debate semantics.</p> <p>\u2022 The need to process it all publicly (\"Look at me look at me look at meeee! I am the very MOST aware of my privilege and am therefore the very BEST progressive on the entire internet!\").</p> <p>\u2022 The righteousness.</p> <p>\u2022 The intolerance and inability to respect that those who share your values might not share your opinions on this particular subject.</p> <p>This is where this kind of conversation begins to feel more like liberal bullying, where the only correct response is agreeing and acquiescing. Any other response is seen as ignorant at best, hateful at worst.</p> <p>My priorities with online discourse are dialogue and respect. In my little corner of the online world, I keep my focus on constructive critique and articulate, compassionate communication. Shouting down people who disagree with you (even if I agree with your argument) simply doesn't feel productive or helpful. If I had a dollar for every time we have to delete a blog comment that I personally agreed with because it was stated as an attack \u2026 I could shift my whole business model. Being an asshole: it's not just for the GOD HATES FAGS people any more.</p> <p>Ultimately, when these complaints come up (which has slowly gone from \"monthly\" to \"weekly\" to \"almost daily\"), my editors respond with comments like: \"I understand what you're saying, and share your concern \u2013 but I disagree that this usage is problematic.\" Alternately, sometimes we just say: \"I agree that this usage is problematic, but I'm going to leave it.\" I want to make sure that folks know readers' concerns are heard, but that it doesn't always guarantee that we'll make changes.</p> <p>We're especially unlikely to make changes when readers engage in performance art privilege checking and refuse to have a direct dialogue with us. I often respond to a semantics-debating comment with an invitation for the commenter to email me directly to discuss the issue. Almost no one ever does. Apparently, having a one-on-one dialogue with a publisher isn't as edifying as performance art.</p> <p>For those of you who like to fight the good fight for social justice and language sensitivity online, before writing that Tumblr missive or firing off that privilege-checking comment, I'd love to encourage you to take a moment to ask yourself these questions:</p> <p>\u2022 Am I living my values with this exchange? If my goal is tolerance and sensitivity, am I embodying both those values in this conversation?</p> <p>\u2022 What are my motivations here? Do I want to make a difference, or just feel like I'm right? What would \"making a difference\" look like in this context?</p> <p>\u2022 Is this person an ally? How can I best communicate with them to ensure they stay that way?</p> <p>\u2022 What is my ultimate goal in my activism? Is this exchange the best use of my time to achieve that ultimate goal?</p> <p>In terms of my ultimate goal with this post: I want to support progressive activists in their very important work for social justice, but also beg them to carefully consider their methods and strategies with online communication. We're fighting for the same team, here. I wish we didn't have to spend so much time fighting with each other.</p> <p>\u2022 A <a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/2012/10/liberal-bullying\" title=\"\">version of this blog post</a> first appeared on Offbeat Empire.</p>",
  "<p>Flavor Flav's fractious relationship with the law shows no sign of abating: Chuck D's sideman in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/public-enemy\" title=\"\">Public Enemy</a> has been arrested by Las Vegas police for assault with a deadly weapon after allegedly threatening his fianc\u00e9e's 17-year-old son with a knife.</p> <p>The rapper, 53, could face six years in prison if convicted. He was being held in Clark county jail ahead of an expected court appearance today, with bail set at $23,000 (\u00a314,000).</p> <p>The news comes just after Public Enemy were announced as among the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/04/kraftwerk-public-enemy-hall-of-fame\" title=\"\">nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> next year, and ahead of the group's headline set at the <a href=\"http://www.relentlessfreeze.com/index.php\" title=\"\">Freeze festival</a> in London on 27 October.</p> <p>Flavor Flav has been in trouble with the law repeatedly throughout his life, starting with robbery and burglary charges when he was still at school.

  "<p>David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/17/energy-firms-forced-lowest-tariff\" title=\"\">announcement yesterday that the government would legislate to force energy companies to put customers on their lowest tariffs</a> sounded good for a couple of hours. But by last night <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/energy-tariff-plans-under-pressure\" title=\"\">it had unravelled</a>. Even consumer groups argued that it was unworkable and would destroy what little competition there is in the energy market, forcing prices up not down.</p> <p>It neatly symbolised the current disarray in the government's energy policy, which is fast approaching crisis point. As it prepares to publish its long-awaited <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">energy bill</a>, the choice at stake could not be more critical: whether Britain moves towards a low-carbon energy system that contributes to tackling climate change, or a continuing fossil fuel-based one that locks in high greenhouse gas emissions for the next 40 years.</p> <p>The bill will set out a new system for regulation of Britain's energy market. The task is to give the private energy sector the incentive to install the \u00a3100bn-plus of investment needed to keep the lights on, replacing ageing power stations and upgrading transmission grids, while keeping energy prices competitive.</p> <p>Given the different needs of different technologies \u2013 principally renewables, nuclear and gas \u2013 this was never going to be easy. But in the past few months a huge fissure has opened up in the coalition, that has left the bill drafting process in complete confusion. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/george-osborne-letter-ed-davey-gas-wind\" title=\"\">a leaked letter in July</a>, the chancellor, George Osborne, told the energy secretary, Ed Davey, that support for renewables should be capped, and Britain should meet its energy needs instead through a major expansion of gas-fired power.</p> <p>Davey might have resisted. Instead, he acceded to the chancellor's demand and last month announced a new \"dash for gas\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/gas-fired-power-stations-uk\" title=\"\">with 20 new gas-fired power stations to be built over the next 20 years</a>. Since ministers cannot decide how many gas power stations get built (the energy companies do that), the announcement could only have been a signal that the incentives for renewables would be cut.</p> <p>The result has been uproar. With the UK's low-carbon energy goals apparently to be cast aside, the energy companies, their investors, and the green technology businesses which supply them have been left facing huge uncertainty about their own futures.</p> <p>The choice between gas and renewables is not absolute. Gas is a flexible fuel which can supply the back-up needed when wind and solar are not flowing. With carbon capture and storage (CCS), it can even become low-carbon. If coal-fired plants were phased out more quickly \u2013 the best way of cutting emissions \u2013 there is certainly room for more gas. But Osborne and his supporters on the right of the Conservative party, backed by strident campaigning by the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph, explicitly reject both back-up capacity and CCS, and oppose regulation of coal emissions. Citing the huge increase in shale gas which has transformed the American energy market in recent years, they want gas to become the centrepiece of Britain's energy future.</p> <p>But the argument made is false. In the US it is true that shale gas has slashed energy prices, forcing the closure of many coal-fired power stations and thereby reducing US emissions. But as Chatham House and others have pointed out, the UK and Europe do not have accessible shale gas in anything like the same volume, it will be some years before it can be commercially exploited and it is unlikely to be cheap. It was striking that the CBI director general, John Cridland, immediately repudiated Davey's announcement, warning that excessive reliance on gas would leave the UK exposed to dangerous global price and supply fluctuations.</p> <p>The Conservative right complains of the cost to consumers of green policies. But the Climate Change Committee has shown that such policies have contributed only one-sixth of the price rises consumers have experienced over the past decade. Almost all the rest has come from the rising cost of gas. It is precisely this that has caused the energy giants to increase their prices again this week.</p> <p>As the government's own analysis shows, there are no cheap energy futures, whatever technologies are chosen. The huge advantage of renewables is that, once built, the fuel is free, and home-grown. The answer to rising prices is therefore not to abandon the low-carbon agenda, but to reinforce it through higher energy efficiency.</p> <p>So will the energy bill confirm that Osborne and the Tory right have won and Britain is now dashing for gas? The whisper in Whitehall is that a compromise may be reached, in which Davey gets a \"decarbonisation\" target for 2030, while Osborne imposes a cap on renewable subsidies.</p> <p>But this would not be a compromise at all. For investors, an aspirational target almost two decades hence is worth little \u2013 you can't bank money on it. What matters is the regime in place for investment now, and if the subsidies are capped, that will inevitably mean (with nuclear protected) that renewables are displaced by gas.</p> <p>This is a real test both for the Liberal Democrats and for Cameron, whose famous promise that the coalition would be \"the greenest government ever\" is on the line.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Jacobs is visiting professor in the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics</p>",
  "<h2>Berina Uruci at Barclays Capital</h2> <p>We now have data for the whole of the third quarter and these suggest sales volumes grew by 1% quarter-on-quarter compared with zero growth during the previous quarter. This is a marked improvement from the low growth seen over the past two years and suggests that after experiencing tough trading conditions for a prolonged period of time, retailing conditions could be improving now. Although not all headwinds facing the sector have disappeared, with consumer confidence and household income growth likely to remain well below historical levels, we expect the sector to stabilise in the coming months. More generally, we expect private consumption to be broadly flat for the second half of this year before it starts a measured recovery from the beginning of next year.</p> <h2>Philip Rush, UK economist at Nomura</h2> <p>The stability of sales in recent months has been pleasantly surprising against the backdrop of disruption from the diamond jubilee and Olympics. Unsettled weather conditions earlier in the year had delivered much more volatility. Through it all though, the trend rate of growth has remained brisk and the September performance perpetuated that strength. The only thing that has really changed in 2012 to explain this improvement is the alleviation of inflation pressure on the high street.</p> <p>Value growth has been remarkably stable since the Great Recession, only it was previously all being funnelled into paying higher prices. Consumers were essentially running just to stand still. Extra signs of strength in the durable items are particularly encouraging as it shows greater willingness of consumers to spend on high-ticket items. The income and confidence that comes with having a job (employment is now at its highest ever level) is a wonderful motivator.</p> <h2>Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>September's rise in the official measure of retail sales volumes suggested that consumers have loosened their purse strings a little. However, the rise partly reflected temporary sources of support. Furthermore, the outlook for spending has darkened over the past month.</p> <p>However, some of this growth seems to have reflected temporary factors, not least a recovery from the Olympics-related drop in spending in August. The autumnal weather and delayed back-to-school spending probably also accounted for some of the 2% monthly rise in clothing sales volumes.</p> <p>What's more, the outlook for spending in the run-up to Christmas does not look particularly encouraging. The recently announced utility price hikes look set to add renewed pressure on household incomes. And the latest labour market indicators suggested that the strong growth in employment is likely to come to an end soon. Meanwhile, the low level of consumer confidence continues to point on the basis of past form to renewed falls in retail sales volumes. So a sustained recovery in retail spending still seems unlikely to get under way soon.</p> <h2>Alan Clarke, fixed income strategy at Global Banking and Markets, Scotiabank</h2> <p>The headwinds from inflation that were squeezing household real disposable income have now abated. These data suggest that consumers have been prepared to spend that \"windfall\". The second half of the year promises to be much better than the first half.</p> <h2>Shehan Mohamed, senior economist, Centre for Economics and Business Research</h2> <p>Robust increases in retail sales in the past few months suggests consumer spending growth could be positive in the third quarter. However, continued business uncertainty is likely to dampen investment growth while government spending could be negative drag. We therefore could expect mildly positive growth in the third quarter in our central case scenario.</p> <p>Whilst the labour market appears to be picking up, pay growth is expected to be flat in real terms for the remainder of this year. The cost of housing is increasing at a high pace compared with income growth \u2013 private rents are up 3.2% year-on-year in September while house prices are up 1.8% in the year to August based on the ONS House Price Index measure. As such, expect discretionary retail purchases to be shelved as consumers continue to seek value in tough economic conditions.</p> <h2>Malcolm Barr, UK economist at JP Morgan</h2> <p>The usual health warning that the UK retail sales data are often a poor guide to overall spending trends applies. But the establishment of a decent uptrend in retail sales sits alongside national accounts estimates for household consumption which have shown stabilisation since late last year, confidence and mortgage approvals numbers that are weak in level terms but are broadly stable, and an uptrend in the level of private car registrations.</p> <p>Lurking in the background is that the drag on real income growth from high rates of inflation is fading, even though that process is set to a knock in the coming handful of months thanks to increases in domestic energy bills. Whether the fading of drags on household income will help generate enough spending growth to drive a recovery worthy of the name remains in significant doubt. But the broadening signs of a return to growth in household spending is mildly encouraging at this stage.</p>",
  "<p>ITV seems to desperately want Cilla Black back. First it introduced Take Me Out \u2013 basically Blind Date in a hall of mirrors underneath a nightclub \u2013 to plug the gaps in its Saturday evening schedules, and on Sunday it will revive Surprise, Surprise. Obviously, this being an ITV show in the year 2012, the new Surprise, Surprise will be presented by Holly Willoughby. Hopefully she won't have to wail the theme tune at the start of every episode like Cilla did, but other than that the format will apparently remain largely untouched.</p> <p>In lots of ways it seems like a sensible enough move. In its 80s and 90s heyday, Surprise, Surprise was a juggernaut that dominated Sunday evening television. Wishes were granted, celebrities turned up, families were reunited. It was the Noel's Christmas Presents that ran all year, the John Barrowman's Tonight's the Night that you could watch without immediately turning to strong drink, the Jim'll Fix It that it's still OK to like.</p> <p>It was also impossibly mawkish; a lowest common denominator Hallmark slushfest that pandered shamelessly to our basest emotions. The show wasn't content unless someone, either onscreen or in the audience, was bawling their eyes out. Also, nobody ever admitted to liking it. There was always a sense that people only watched Surprise, Surprise because Sunday lunch had rendered them inert, the remote control (if there was one) was on the other side of the room and they'd already thrown both slippers at the set in an enfeebled attempt to change channels.</p> <p>But maybe it can work again. Take Me Out has updated the Blind Date format so successfully that you can barely move for other dating shows trying to rip it off. In fact, the more like Blind Date it becomes, the better Take Me Out gets. The VTs of the actual dates are getting longer, the contestants are no longer just there to be laughed at and Paddy McGuinness is slowly transforming into a lovably sexless matchmaker before our very eyes. It's an increasingly charming, uncomplicated hour of television that doesn't ask too much of its viewers \u2013 perfect Saturday night fodder, basically.</p> <p>Perhaps Surprise, Surprise can pull off the same trick. The original might have sputtered out due to waning interest a decade ago, but the country has changed since then. Shamelessly sentimental wish-fulfillment shows have flourished in these hard times. Just look at DIY SOS. It's essentially about Nick Knowles wielding a hammer and goading people to cry, and yet people still watch. With that as a standard bearer, the thought of lovely Holly Willoughby going, \"Aww,\" and introducing an elderly woman to the brother she thought had died sounds like a no-brainer.</p> <p>The question is whether or not Surprise, Surprise can thrive without Cilla Black. Even more so than Blind Date or the rightly forgotten Moment of Truth, this was her show. It relied on her ability to balance any number of emotions, to empathise with people of any background, to stand at the top of an ersatz staircase every week and belt out the same terrible theme-tune without any trace of shame or regret. The show was so intrinsically Cilla that it's bound to seem weird with an interloper in charge.</p> <p>Of course, if the new Surprise, Surprise does go bad, there's no reason why ITV shouldn't ask Cilla back. After all, it's contorting itself rotten trying to mimic her golden years, so wouldn't it be the decent thing to get her back on telly?</p>",
  "<p>Simon Hoggart is one of my oldest friends, so I try not to say \"Simon is right\" more than is strictly necessary. But he's 100% right in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/17/andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">his parliamentary sketch today</a> when he likens Ed Miliband's assault on the Tory chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, to bear-baiting, which was made illegal in this country in 1835.</p> <p>It's a month since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-police-row-move-along\" title=\"\">I last protested that Mitchell had behaved badly</a> in abusing an obstructive police officer who had refused to open Downing Street's security gates for the great man's bike. But I also argued that he'd apologised and it was now time to move on.</p> <p>It was obvious even then that the police are in an industrial dispute with the government and were politicising the incident for partisan advantage. So were Labour MPs \u2013 it's their job, up to a point \u2013 Tory newspapers who think Mitchell a bit snooty and too free with the taxpayers' aid money, and some Conservative MPs who don't like him either.</p> <p>All that has since become even more evident. The West Mercia chapter of the Police Federation had a session with Mitchell \u2013 he's a Birmingham MP \u2013 which didn't go very well. Afterwards its spokesman demanded his resignation from the government. Who do these people think they are? It's not as if the West Midlands force is covered in glory. It's crime clean-up rate is down, according to a local website, and it was compromised in the Hillsborough cover-up.</p> <p>As for the press, well they like to have their cake and gobble it too. Today's Daily Mail \u2013 my touchstone in these matters \u2013 complains about the cops Tasering a blind man (his white stick apparently looked like a Samurai sword) all over page one, but on the inside pages it's Mitchell-baiting as usual.</p> <p>At a meeting of the backbench 1922 committee of Tory MPs last night more colleagues spoke in his defence than were critical. One of the critics, the MP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Duddridge\" title=\"\">James Duddridge</a>, who has risen and fallen without much trace, is reported as urging Mitchell to fall on his sword. But he was sacked as a whip last month so that's hardly rocket science.</p> <p>David Cameron is hanging on to his chief whip, though not without cost. Bad headlines are not what he needs and yesterday's bear-baiting at PMQs took the shine off the better employment figures, which we should welcome even if we don't rate the government's austerity strategy (and we don't, do we?). My hunch is that he'll survive.</p> <p>But Labour's strategy is to use the affair to reinforce the notion that posh boys like Cameron, George Osborne and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> \u2013 a well-off scion of Rugby School and Cambridge \u2013 don't understand real life and are typical of the coalition's overprivileged cabinet. Someone made that point to me on Twitter during PMQs.</p> <p>That makes sense as political tactics (if not overdone, Ed), but it prompts me to ask if it is actually true. \"Less than half the cabinet are very privileged,\" I told my friend on Twitter. Actually that's an exaggeration, as a quick canter through their Wiki CVs will confirm.</p> <p>Briefly Cameron, Nick Clegg and chancellor Osborne are famously children of upper middle-class metropolitan privilege. Broadly speaking so are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt_(politician)\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a> (health) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Paterson\" title=\"\">Owen Paterson</a> (environment), in the sense that they went to well-known public schools and Oxbridge. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Galbraith,_2nd_Baron_Strathclyde\" title=\"\">Lord Strathclyde</a> is quite posh too, like Mitchell <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_Galbraith\" title=\"\">the son of a Tory MP</a> who (as it happens) was unfairly hounded by the tabloids in the Vassall spy affair.</p> <p>More than half the cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge, but as with Labour or the Thatcher/Major era Tories, that usually reflects academic vigour rather than privilege. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May\" title=\"\">Theresa May</a> is a clergyman's daughter whose grammar school became a comp. Chris Grayling went to a state school, so did Phil Hammond, son of an engineer in Essex. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Duncan_Smith\" title=\"\">Iain Duncan Smith</a>, whose dad was a flying ace in the second world war, attended an RC secondary school and HMS Conway, a school for forces brats.</p> <p>Justine Greening went to a Rotherham comprehensive, just like William Hague, whose dad was a local pop-maker. Ken Clarke's dad was a watchmaker whose clever son went to Nottingham High \u2013 like Ed Balls \u2013 and on to Cambridge to become a lawyer. Greening went to Southampton University and became an accountant. And so on.</p> <p>Vince Cable is a clever working-class boy from York. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Alexander#Early_life_and_education\" title=\"\">Danny Alexander</a> attended state schools in the Highlands, then Oxford. Theresa Villiers is a bit posh as her name implies \u2013 she went to Francis Holland School in London, then to Bristol U. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Pickles\" title=\"\">Eric Pickles</a> speaks for himself and Yorkshire, a grammar school boy who went on to Leeds Poly. Patrrick McLoughlin (transport) is an ex-miner, the son and grandson of miners, who worked as a farm labourer.</p> <p>The Lib Dem Scottish secretary, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore_(British_politician)\" title=\"\">Michael Moore</a>, the son of a British army chaplain (there's plenty of army and the church in these CVs), went to grammar school. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Miller\" title=\"\">Maria Miller</a> (culture) went to a comprehensive in Bridgend. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jones_(Welsh_politician)\" title=\"\">David Jones</a> (Wales) went to a Welsh grammar and UCL.

But it's not posh or privileged and to say so is as daft as the Tory papers trying to prove (as they do) that Ed Miliband's own background \u2013 the son of refugees who attended a north London comp \u2013 is posh or privileged. Clever is different.</p> <p>All of which serves to underline the importance of very the underprivileged (he's got over it) Alan Milburn's latest push \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/18/coalition-child-poverty-ema-1\" title=\"\">reported here by Patrick Wintour</a> \u2013 to ensure that people's backgrounds, their educational contextual data, is taken into account when handing out life's plums, including Oxbridge places.</p> <p>If we're going to throw bricks at each other \u2013 or plums \u2014 best to get that contextual data right. We still waste a lot of talent in this country \u2013 and all parties share some of the blame.</p>",
  "<h2>Sara Ley, head of retail, <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/\" title=\"\">BALTIC</a></h2> <p><strong>It's about location, location, location:</strong> We try to promote our retail offer throughout the building \u2013 for example, we have prints in our restaurant, kids products in our learning area and homeware in our cafe. We recently turned our locker area into a second shop for cards, which has worked really well for us. I think it's really important to explore all options and remind visitors throughout their visit that the shop exists.</p> <p><strong>Place products to tap into human behaviour:</strong> We always make sure our products near the entrance to the shop reference our exhibitions. Depending on the season, for example Christmas, we'll also ensure related products are in a prime location. Our products for kids are in the centre of our shop to entice families in, and it's also a good idea to have larger kids products available to use and play with, which drives sales for us.</p> <p>We ensure our window displays are replicated at the front of our shop and at the till point as well, which is also a great place for smaller pick up items and gift books.</p> <p><strong>Share the load with other museums: </strong>We've recently begun working with a nearby venue to share costs on producing bespoke items \u2013 this really helps spread the cost when you have high minimum order quantities.</p> <p><strong>Talk to your customers:</strong> Your sales will give you the best indication of what works and what your visitors expect but our communications department do spend a lot of time, through market research, defining who our customers are and where they come from. Exit and online surveys, and customer focus groups work well \u2013 our staff learn a lot about our customers just by speaking with people.</p> <p><strong>Use new designers:</strong> They do, however, need to be on brand in terms of the look and feel of the shop. Price point is an important factor, as well as minimum order quantity \u2013 you don't want to have to commit to a large amount of products. Lead times and availability is also important; designers need to ensure they can fulfil orders within a reasonable timescale. Finally, look for originality.</p> <p><strong>Take the shop outside and on the road: </strong>We've experimented with taking the shop out of the gallery this year by attending fairs and markets \u2013 it has been working really well, raising awareness of the shop and the gallery. We've just finished a series of fresher's fairs, which have been great fun and a lot of students come down afterwards to check out the shop.</p> <p>Our Twitter page in particular works really well for us as well, and a good social media presence is key. We have an excellent relationship with one of the leading high street department stores and they've allowed us to promote our shop events and some of our exclusive products in-store.</p> <h2>Jeremy Ensor, commercial director, <a href=\"http://www.ashmolean.org/\" title=\"\">Ashmolean Museum</a></h2> <p><strong>Know your customer:</strong> The key question for any retailer has to be: who is your customer? From market research you should have a good idea how many families, school parties, older adults and so on visit you. The most important criteria for any product selection should be that it is RELEVANT to your collections.</p> <p>Whoever the visitor is, they'll be wanting something that reminds them of their visit and (ideally) can't find anywhere else locally. From there, price architecture needs to be thought of to ensure you have products at price points that appeal to each audience.</p> <p><strong>Don't just target the kids: </strong>Gifts aimed at a more mature audience can be very successful through higher average transaction values, but quality is a very important factor in product development. This is certainly where exclusivity and relevance to the collection are key factors in converting these customers to buy</p> <p><strong>It's all about the service: </strong>The standard of customer service given in a museum shop is vitally important because it's likely to be the last interaction the visitor has with a member of museum staff. It will be their lasting impression! A smile, enquiring if they enjoyed their time at the museum, and what their favourite part was and so on are all things they can talk about to help this process and leave a positive memory.</p> <h2>Sarah Sevier, brand development and buying, <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">V&amp;A</a></h2> <p><strong>Plan for next season: </strong>Your own sales analysis doesn't lie; use it when creating next season's range. Also, don't be swayed by lower prices to purchase unrealistic quantities that might sit in your warehouse for years and years, so put together a range and then EDIT it down. Anything else? You don't have to represent everything in your collection at one time \u2013 oh, and orphan products almost always need a friend... or two!</p> <h2>Sue Shave, museum director, <a href=\"http://www.coam.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Chiltern Open Air Museum</a></h2> <p><strong>The value of a store is more than just financial:</strong> Museum shops are part of the whole visitor experience and should be treated as such. For independent museums and charities like ours, there is, of course, a financial benefit to the retail operation but museums work hard to ensure stock relates to the uniqueness of their collections and helps to promote them as well.</p> <p>For us the shop is at the entrance and exit of the museum and is part of the welcome visitors receive from our reception volunteers and this, too, is part of the experience.</p> <p><strong>Think about price because every penny counts:</strong> Advice we received during a recent Renaissance funded consultancy was that higher price points should definitely be 'round pounds' (\u00a350 as opposed to \u00a349.99) to denote quality but that you might want to consider .99 for lower prices under \u00a310 to indicate value or bargains. I tend towards the round pound version now!</p> <h2>Meghan Cole, head of retail, <a href=\"http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/\" title=\"\">Shakespeare's Globe</a></h2> <p><strong>Arrange your products with personality: </strong>We merchandise all our ranges in the same way: T-shirts top left; bags top right; mugs across the middle. It creates a very strong and confident look in the shop, and this seems to promote better sales. It says we are confident in our products and it makes it visually easier for the customer to find what they want.</p> <p><strong>Illuminate the shop:</strong> Sort out the lighting if it's too dark because if the customer can't see your products, they won't buy any!</p> <p><strong>Invest in full-time staff:</strong> I'm not convinced volunteers have a place on the shop team. My team is highly trained and has expert knowledge not only about what they are selling, but about the site and surrounds \u2013 it would mean a considerable investment in time for a volunteer to keep up to speed with an ever-changing product file.</p> <p><strong>Don't think too far outside the box:</strong> Don't merchandise Coriolanus!

  "<h2>NHS and social care bill </h2> <p>The government was forced to introduce a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/06/government-pause-listen-reflect-improve-nhs-reform\" title=\"\">\"pause\" in April 2011 to allow a two-month listening exercise</a> over the radical plans to overhaul the NHS, after a chorus of protests and claims that the policy was in chaos. Two months later, David Cameron <a href=\"avid Cameron admitted that he had made mistakes on the NHS as he agreed to make \" substantive\" changes to the health and social care bill after endorsing main recommendations of an independent panel experts.\" title=\"\">would admit that he had made mistakes</a> on the NHS as he agreed to make \"substantive\" changes to the legislation following recommendations by a panel of experts. The prime minister sought to cast the rethink <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/14/david-cameron-nhs-reform-rethink?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">as a \"sign of strength\"</a>.</p> <h2>Credit card rethink </h2> <p>David Cameron's call on Britons to pay off the credit card and store card bill backfired before he had even delivered the words in October 2011, after it was pointed out that heeding that advice would make a bad economic situation worse since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/oct/05/economy-toryconference\" title=\"\">it would lead to a spending fall at a time when the economy needed a desperate boost.</a> His comments were due to be included in a speech to his party conference, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/05/cameron-speech-rewritten-credit-card-call\" title=\"\">his script was swiftly amended </a>after the implications of calling on households to pay off their debts dawned on Downing Street. Aides said the pre-briefed version of the speech to journalists had been \"misinterpreted\" so they changed the wording to clarify it. Cameron's script was changed from: \"The only way out of a debt crisis is to deal with your debts. That means households \u2013 all of us \u2013 paying off the credit card and store card bills\" to \"That is why households are paying down the credit card and store card bills.\"</p> <h2>Pasty gate </h2> <p>George Osborne's announcement in his 2012 budget that VAT would be slapped on food designed to cool down, such as sausage rolls and pasties, proved half baked. The measure was cast as a sign that ministers were \"out of touch\" with the ordinary person and had to be scrapped two months later. This was just one of several policy announcements in the budget to be reversed. The tax relief cap on charitable donations at \u00a350,000 or 25% of income was another plan scrapped, and the 20% VAT on static caravans was reduced to 5% following protests.</p> <h2>School inspections</h2> <p>Unannounced inspections of schools by Ofsted were shelved in May 2012 after a storm of protests from headteachers. The education secretary, Michael Gove, conceded that it might send a message that members of the teaching profession were not trusted and that there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/may/05/michael-gove-u-turn-ofsted\" title=\"\">a perception that Ofsted was becoming \"an arm of the Spanish Inquisition\"</a>.</p> <h2>Housing benefit for the unemployed</h2> <p>Government plans to impose a 10% cut in housing benefit on anyone unemployed for more than a year was announced in the June 2010 emergency budget but <a href=\"The government has dropped plans to impose a 10% cut in housing benefit on anyone unemployed for more than a year after a last-minute intervention by Nick Clegg.  The cut was proposed in the June emergency budget, but will now not feature in the welfare reform bill published by Iain Duncan Smith.  Last week the work and pensions secretary maintained that the 10% cut would be kept to give unemployed people an incentive to find work. But the measure was seen by many Liberal Democrats as punishing the poor twice.  Clegg also feared that private sector landlords in areas of high unemployment would be reluctant to rent to jobseeker's allowance claimants if their housing benefit income was at risk of being reduced.  Duncan Smith denied that the idea was dumped due to opposition from Clegg, insisting: \" i am fully at one with nick on this.\"\" title=\"\">ditched eight months later</a> after the Liberal Democrats warned the measure would punish the poor twice over.</p>",
  "<p>Peace activists and human rights groups <a href=\"http://theriskyshift.com/2012/06/drones-the-missing-moral-compass/\" title=\"\">have been vocal</a> in their condemnation of the US policy of drone strikes against militant targets in Pakistan and Yemen.</p> <p>The narrative often repeated by these groups is that drones are loathed in both countries, and are driving the population into the arms of militants. But the reality on the ground is <a href=\"http://theriskyshift.com/2012/07/a-milder-war-drones-pastun-public-opinion/\" title=\"\">much more complex</a>.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://brianglynwilliams.com/\" title=\"\">Brian Glyn Williams</a>, professor of Islamic history at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, and author of the upcoming book Predators: The CIA's Drone War on Al Qaeda, many local people in tribal areas support surgical strikes by drones over large-scale ground offensives by the Pakistani army. While public opinion in the rest of the country may be strongly anti-drone, he found, for those Pakistanis living under Taliban rule, it is not so clear-cut: \"The local tribes turned on the Taliban for killing hundreds of their maliks (tribal leaders), enforcing strict sharia law, executing 'spies', closing schools for girls, carrying out suicide bombings, and generally terrorizing the population.\"</p> <p>What has gone largely unreported is the fact that not only have drones been successful in disrupting terrorist plots and militant networks, but that the number of civilian casualties is actually low. According to the New America Foundation, which tracks data from major news sources in both the west and Pakistan, <a href=\"http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones\" title=\"\">drone strike accuracy has been steadily increasing</a> \u2013 going from a 9% to 10% civilian death rate in 2008 to a 0% civilian death rate in 2012. <a href=\"http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=37165\" title=\"\">Two</a> <a href=\"http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php\" title=\"\">other</a> studies, also working from both Pakistani and western data, came to similar conclusions.</p> <p>Comparing the threat posed by militants and terrorists \u2013 both to Pakistani society and to the west \u2013 to the threat posed by drones, Williams is emphatic: \"The drones are saving civilians, not killing them.\" He cites the failed 2010 plot by British jihadis to carry out a \"commando-style\" attack on civilian targets in Europe \u2013 all of the plotters involved were killed in drone strikes.</p> <p>And the threat is even greater to the Pakistani public. Those who beat their chest in fury over the small amount of collateral damage rarely speak out against the slaughter of thousands by the Taliban.</p> <p>The claim that drones are turning locals into militants is also far from proven. In the tribal regions, Williams says, \"there are very few undecideds \u2013 you are going to tolerate the drones because they go after your enemies, or you are going to be with the Taliban. Drones aren't going to drive people into the arms of the Taliban\".</p> <p>A strikingly similar point is made by <a href=\"http://christopher-swift.com/\" title=\"\">Christopher Swift</a>, a lawyer and political scientist who conducted 40 interviews with Yemeni tribal leaders and Islamist politicians across the country in June. In Yemen, \"drones aren't the primary driver of al-Qaida recruiting,\" Swift says. \"Economic desperation, corruption, breakdown of traditional culture, they are driving recruitment.\"</p> <p>Swift's research echoes Williams' fieldwork among Pakistani tribal leaders.</p> <p>\"The closer I got to people who are actively fighting al-Qaida in Yemen, the more they wanted the US to maintain its drone programme,\" Swift, an adjunct professor of national security studies at Georgetown University, says. Away from the battleground, in cities and in educated circles, people were militantly opposed to drones and saw them as a neocolonial instrument. The closer you are to the problem, says Swift, the more you understand the value of force as a policy instrument.</p> <p>That proximity to danger can make for some surprising \u2013 if wary \u2013 allies. Swift recounts meeting a Yemeni member of the Muslim Brotherhood: \"his general feeling was very sceptical of US intervention in Yemen and the Middle East as a whole, inclined to see this as part of the clash of civilisations paradigm,\" says Swift. \"But also as someone who was dealing with al-Qaida and knew how bad they are.\" He supported the US drone strikes, \"with conditions\", such as no civilian casualties and minimal force.</p> <p>When it comes to drones, Swift says, we are asking ourselves the wrong questions. Drones have become a free-floating signifier in the US, Europe and the Middle East for all the other debates we are having about security and politics, he argues.</p> <p>Ultimately, the debate over the drone campaign is a distraction from other, more important issues in Yemen: maternal and child health, access to water, adherence to the rule of law. Drones are a side show.</p> <p>The problem is not drones per se, but the fact that by using them the US government is applying short-term solutions to long-term problems. Drones may not be driving al-Qaida recruitment, but neither are they bringing peace and stability. That would take sustained reform.</p>",
  "<p>As autumn creeps into winter and more clothing is needed to ward off the chills, I have finally plucked up the courage to check my woollens to make sure there are no signs of moth damage.</p> <p>So far, so good: storage bags from Lakeland have successfully protected my cherished hand-knitted sweaters and a couple of cashmere jumpers. Holding dark items up to the light is a handy way of finding out whether any fine dining has been taking place.</p> <p>I am now well over halfway through my self-imposed challenge not to buy any clothes for a year, and found the summer months much easier than the colder ones. But having to return to my tights and sock drawer after several months of bare-legged freedom has been a sobering experience.</p> <p>Fortunately my mother taught me how to darn and mend tights and socks, which I have got used to doing. The problem is that most of my tights tend to attract holes and ladders around the toes and feet. So when I pulled on a thick pair of tights last week for work, I was very conscious of the long and rather uncomfortable ridges under my toes. Wearing a pair of wide chunky boots seemed to ease the discomfort.</p> <p>I'm certainly not the only person to be undertaking this kind of challenge and wondering about the <a href=\"http://www.daisygreenmagazine.co.uk/blogs/fashion-forward/the-challenge-%E2%80%93-in-a-tight-spot/\" title=\"The Challenge  in a tight spot\">practicalities of mending tights</a>. There's no point trying to mend sheer or low denier tights as they are too fragile, but you can certainly extend the life of thicker nylon, cotton and wool tights and socks.</p> <p>The key with any kind of sewing or repairs is to do it as quickly as possible (or to stop ladders in their tracks with a dash of nail varnish as an emergency measure) so you are not endlessly unfurling hosiery first thing in the morning, greeting every unexpected ladder or tear with a yelp of frustration. When the tights \u2013 with their webs of intricate hand-stitching \u2013 are really too far gone for further repair I put them in my local textile recycling bank and marvel at the bit of extra space that has been freed up.</p> <p>This week, retailers such as John Lewis and Topshop and knitting groups across the UK are helping to champion British wool as part of Wool Week. Backed by the <a href=\"http://www.campaignforwool.org/about-wool/\" title=\"Campaign for Wool website\">Campaign for Wool</a> it is dedicated to raising the profile of the natural fibre as a sustainable and stylish substance, and one of the most effective, natural forms of all-weather protection. And it is perfect for upcycling: boiled or \"felted\" wool can be used to make handbags, corsages and badges, and even <a href=\"http://www.angelabarrow.co.uk/Blog/\" title=\"Angela Barrow blog\">jewellery and art</a>.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer is selling its first garment made from old or unwanted woollen clothing donated by customers through its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/apr/26/marks-spencer-shwopping-scheme incentive\" title=\"MS launches 'shwopping' scheme\">shwopping scheme</a>. The limited edition double-breasted 1960s pea coat is on sale in selected stores and online for \u00a389 \u2013 half the cost it would be if made from virgin wool.</p> <p>Not that I will be buying one, of course.</p> <p>At home I've been hunting for bright accessories to lift the spirit. I've got my eye on the luminous orange chunky scarf my daughter started knitting last year. It is only a square at the moment but I am an eternal optimist.</p> <p>I am heading into the last lap of what has been a life-changing exercise, and one which has definitely helped my bank balance. But with the high streets filled with fabulously stylish autumn wear, I am determined to stay strong and resist temptation. Though I'm not looking forward to the racks of party dresses and evening wear that will be wheeled out in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>How do you cope with the retail temptation offered by the new seasonal ranges? And do you feel guilty when you have Christmas shopping to think about as well</p>",
  "<p>Aid is a huge global industry whose success is not at all obvious. Despite some gains, poverty has not been eradicated, climate change has not been halted and rights have not been respected. Yet poor outcomes are blamed on technical glitches, and fundamental deficiencies in aid policy remain unexamined. Palestine is an important illustration of this, owing to the high level of aid dependence, the many international donors involved and the millions of Palestinians who have suffered for decades despite billions of dollars being spent.</p> <p>I've been disillusioned with aid-funded development in Palestine since I arrived in 2004 and found local NGOs chasing international funding by modifying their programmes, publishing information in English rather than in Arabic, and hiring extra staff to submit financial reports in foreign currencies. In response, I helped found the Dalia Association, a Palestinian NGO that promotes self-determination through local control over resources. Dalia's articles <a href=\"http://www.dalia.ps/node/123\" title=\"\">\"Does the international aid system violate Palestinian rights?\"</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dalia.ps/node/179\" title=\"\">\"Don't forget your duty to do no harm in Gaza\"</a> framed aid in Palestine as a right and linked aid advocacy to the Palestinian national movement as well as to the <a href=\"http://betteraid.org/\" title=\"\">global aid reform movement</a>.</p> <p>Dalia published a study of grassroots civil society priorities for aid reform, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GGoVjRvAnw&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">distributed a short film</a>, and launched an international petition to broaden awareness. Locals were enthusiastic, but internationals didn't respond. Perhaps they thought their good intentions freed them from responsibility for the collective impact of aid on Palestinians.</p> <p>I still hoped we could influence aid policy if we held donors accountable for putting into practice the principles they espouse \u2013 such as local ownership, mutual accountability, and harmonisation with local agendas. I engaged with the formal processes, even taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/fourth-high-level-forum-on-aid-effectiveness\" title=\"\">high-level forum on aid effectiveness</a> and promoting the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/international%20dialogue/anewdealforengagementinfragilestates.htm\" title=\"\">new deal for effective engagement in fragile states</a>. But I become disillusioned. A huge swath of global civil society now appears to be co-opted into a formal process of \"aid reform\" that has a diluted vision, wastes precious resources and often can't practise what it preaches \u2013 all because society groups work within the unacceptably narrow constraints prescribed by donors.</p> <p>So, we shifted focus to Palestinians' own policies. We asked: \"If Palestinians want international aid on their own terms, what are those terms?\" Participants complained: \"Why do donors fund our schools and do nothing when Israel bombs them? Why do donors punish Palestinians for pursuing their legal rights through the UN?\"</p> <p>We know the main obstacle to development is the occupation, colonisation and dispossession of the Palestinian people. The only means to achieve real development, therefore, is a just political settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What emerged was that these Palestinians at least don't want \"aid\" at all. They want political intervention and the financial support they are entitled to in order to pursue their own development. Moreover, they advocated rejection of false development projects that are, at best, distractions, and at worst, harmful to Palestinian dignity, independence and sustainability.</p> <p>Although some kinds of aid are helpful, the system as a whole is closed and self-serving. Because of that, we can't change aid policy through civil society participation. International actors know exactly what they are doing in Palestine: they are perpetuating an unequal but controllable status quo, and they don't want to change. And we can't make them.</p> <p>Maybe we can't change donors' aid policies, but Palestinians can stop participating in their own oppression by refusing aid offered on detrimental terms. Through <a href=\"http://www.bdsmovement.net/\" title=\"\">boycott, divestment and sanctions</a> (BDS), Palestinians and their supporters refuse to do business with people or entities that undermine the prospects for a just peace. Should BDS expand to target aid? I think it should. By focusing on what they can control \u2013 their own policy about what aid they will accept or reject \u2013 Palestinians can take control of their development.</p> <p>The challenge is formidable. There will be political pressure, millions may become even poorer, and the elite may fight efforts to change a system they profit from. But Palestinians may not be as dependent on international aid as they think. If we take a \u20ac10m project and deduct the unnecessary expenditure \u2013 the amount taken by donors and international NGOs for administration, that wasted on non-local priorities, and that spent on overpriced foreign consultants and supplies from Europe \u2013 the remaining balance might be not be so great.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"http://www.noralestermurad.com/2012/08/29/are-there-alternatives-to-dependence-on-international-aid-yes/\" title=\"\">there are alternatives to dependence on aid</a>. And with the help of the Palestinian diaspora and supporters worldwide, Palestinians can develop new models of sustainability that do not require them to mortgage their future to international actors whose vision for Palestine is unacceptable.</p> <p>These are hard times to propose taking risks, but perhaps we've reached these hard times by playing it safe for too long.</p>",

The theme \u2013 the terrible price of dreams that come true \u2013 will be familiar from many of his previous novels. This time, however, the story is told by the femme fatale of the title, Joan. Left in penury at 21 when her abusive husband dies, she schemes to marry a rich man while falling for a poor one. Using the first person is a bold if not entirely successful move: as the femme fatale is a wholly literary construct who is as far removed from actual women as she is from men, to have one addressing you directly about how she balances her household budget and washes her tights is pretty disconcerting. For the author, too, apparently \u2013 the tone falters periodically, as Cain loses confidence in his ability to perform the necessary ventriloquism. That said, the ending is a true shocker, and while it's not <em>Double Indemnity</em> or <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em>, there's enough of the old magic there to make it well worth the read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397825746\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2012/10/16/1350396455518/The-Jewels-of-Paradise.jpg\" alt=\"Donna Leon, The Jewels of Paradise\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donna Leon, The Jewels of Paradise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780434022274/the-jewels-of-paradise\" title=\"\"><strong>The Jewels of Paradise</strong> by Donna Leon </a>(William Heinemann, \u00a317.99)<br>After 21 acclaimed Commissario Brunetti novels, this is Leon's first standalone. Also set in Venice, it is based on the true story of baroque composer Agostino Steffani (1654-1728). Musicologist Caterina Pellegrini is hired in mysterious circumstances to find the true heir to some unspecified treasure mentioned in Steffani's papers, and in digging through the contents of two antique chests she lifts the lid on a world of political scandal, bed-hopping European aristocrats, and religious conflict. No high octane thrills or car chases here \u2013 the investigation is academic rather than dynamic, and the plot more fable-like than convoluted \u2013 but it's a fascinating study of greed, folly and how the most Machiavellian plots ultimately come to naught.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397825747\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2012/10/16/1350396489321/I-Remember-You.jpg\" alt=\"Yrsa Sigurdardottir, I Remember You\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yrsa Sigurdardottir, I Remember You</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I Remember You</strong> by Yrsa Sigurdardottir, translated by Philip Roughton (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a313.99)<br>Another standalone from an author with a hugely enjoyable series (featuring the lawyer Thora Gudmundsdottir). <em>I Remember You</em> is a cross between a crime narrative and a ghost story, with all the usual spectral apparatus \u2013 mysterious messages, sinister stains, creepy children \u2013 and plenty of stormy weather and other atmospherics. The trouble starts when townies begin renovating a building in an isolated village in Iceland. Meanwhile, psychiatrist Freyr aids a police investigation into vandalism at a local primary school and looks into the suicide of an elderly woman who turns out to have been obsessed with the disappearance, three years earlier, of Freyr's six-year-old son.

With several neatly dovetailed plot strands, a memorable cast including a wonderfully impassive Terminator-type hitman and some fashionably kinky sex, this is the best in the series so far.

  "<p>The health of UK social sciences is important to all of us, not just in higher education but in the world beyond. Social science helps us frame questions about the way the social world is ordered, whether we are looking at institutions like marriage or education, or how different societies create and respond to issues like poverty, inequality or crime. Increasingly too there is widespread agreement that many issues arising from natural science research \u2013 climate change or obesity for example \u2013 require social science understanding.</p> <p>UK social science has many strengths, not least in our impressive data infrastructure (with birth cohort studies, longitudinal studies and others), and in imaginative qualitative research. But over the years it has become increasingly clear that it is weaker than it should be in quantitative research skills. The <a href=\"http://www.britac.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Academy's statement</a> on this issue concludes that the deficit in quantitative skills \"has serious implications for the future of the UK's status as a world leader in research and higher education, for the employability of our graduates, and for the competitiveness of the UK's economy\".</p> <p>This matters. It matters because at the very time we have more data than ever about our complex social world, we are weak in producing the skills to fully utilise them. These skills help us to ask fundamental questions about what it means to 'control' for confounding factors, or how we think about whether a particular policy or intervention has made a difference, given the strength of social selection.</p> <p>For example, children born to married couples <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/5632\" title=\"\">tend to have better outcomes</a> than those born to cohabiting couples. But how much of this is due to marriage, and how much arises from the fact that the people who get married tend to be different from those who don't? If a broad range of social scientists don't have the skills to address issues like these, we risk ceding them to the media, or to think tanks or lobbyists with particular agendas.</p> <p>The lack of quantitative skills is not a problem specific to social science. <a href=\"http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/uk-outlier-upper-secondary-maths-education\" title=\"\">A 2010 report from the Nuffield Foundation</a> showed that, out of 24 comparable countries, England, Wales and Northern Ireland had the lowest level of participation in post-16 mathematics. The failure to equip young people with the appropriate quantitative skills for higher education and employment runs throughout our education system, and requires change across its life course.</p> <p>The problem is systemic, but many organisations are working together to try and address it. The Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education (ACME) is consulting on different models for getting more young people <a href=\"http://www.acme-uk.org/the-work-of-acme/proactive-projects/post-16-mathematics\" title=\"\">to study mathematics beyond GCSE</a>. The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) has launched <a href=\"http://www.getstats.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Getstats</a>, a public information campaign to improve how we understand and handle data. Within social science, there have been many positive steps, including <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/crosscutting/sivs/\" title=\"\">HEFCE's initiatives for Strategically Important Vulnerable Subjects</a>, the pilot projects funded by the ESRC to test <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding-and-guidance/tools-and-resources/research-resources/initiatives/qmi.aspx\" title=\"\">new approaches for teaching quantitative methods</a>, and stronger ESRC requirements for quantitative methods in its Doctoral Training Centres.</p> <p>But we need to do more, and that's why we are launching <a href=\"http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/quantitative-methods-undergraduate-social-scientists\" title=\"\">a new programme</a> designed to make a strategic shift in the provision of quantitative methods training for undergraduate social scientists. Over a five-year period, the Nuffield Foundation, the ESRC and HEFCE will invest \u00a315.5m in up to 15 specialist centres to develop and deliver a wide range of training activities to embed quantitative skills training and a deep understanding of research design.</p> <p>Our aim is to give universities as much flexibility as possible to design a programme of activities to build on their existing strengths and develop imaginative new approaches. These activities could include the development of new courses or vacation work placements. Universities could consider ways to link undergraduate and postgraduate provision for quantitative methods training, for example by developing a '3+1' model for degree courses.</p> <p>Quantitative methods need to be taught as more than a bolt-on methods module. Students learn best and are most excited when they develop the skills to apply a range of quantitative methods to substantive and conceptual problems and can do this in a cumulative way. Over time, they acquire not only more sophisticated and advanced skills, but deeper insights into the problems they are interested in.</p> <p>We want a generation of students who will become the excellent social science researchers of tomorrow, confident in their use of logical and causal thinking and able to pass on those skills to others. We want more quantitatively-skilled social scientists working in a range of non-academic occupations. And we hope that this initiative will produce long-lasting institutional changes, at universities and in schools. The evidence suggests this would be good for all of us.</p> <p><em>Sharon Witherspoon is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Nuffield Foundation</em></a><em> \u2013 follow it on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NuffieldFound\" title=\"\"><em>@NuffieldFound</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The government is being forced to make a Commons statement on David Cameron's plan that all energy companies be required to give their customers the lowest tariff.</p> <p>Labour is convinced that Cameron, speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, tripped up and went further than a policy being prepared by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc).</p> <p>The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has granted the shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, an urgent question on the plans, which Labour said were \"unravelling by the minute\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Decc said the energy minister John Hayes would answer the question. Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, was giving a speech on energy market reform in the City on Thursday morning.</p> <p>Labour sources claimed that Downing Street, instead of admitting Cameron had inadvertently gone further than intended, tried to defend the policy, but has now come under intense pressure from energy companies and civil servants to revise the plan.</p> <p>Ed Miliband, an energy secretary in the last Labour government, had previously proposed that energy companies be required to provide the lowest rate, but only for those aged over 75. It was notable that no one from the energy companies or an energy minister appeared on major news programmes on Thursday as Whitehall went into overdrive to try to sort out the policy.</p> <p>The prime minister has been warned he will kill off competition in the energy market if companies are forced to give all their customers the lowest tariff available.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"We have encouraged people to switch, which is one of the best ways to get energy bills down. I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers \u2013 something that Labour did not do in 13 years, even though the leader of the Labour party could have done it because he had the job.\"</p> <p>The unequivocal pledge by the PM on the forthcoming energy bill caused some surprise in Decc. One source said: \"We are looking at lots of ideas about how to use the law to get the lowest tariffs. We are exploring all the options.\"</p> <p>One price comparison website warned that legislation could work against consumers' interests by killing competition. Ann Robinson of uSwitch.com, said: \"This has to be a mistake \u2013 the unintended consequences would be to kill competition. Consumers will be left with Hobson's choice \u2013 there will be no spur, no choice, no innovation and no reason for consumers to engage any more. The only glimmer of hope would be that smaller suppliers will be able to offer cheaper prices than the big six and therefore competition is able to continue in that arena.\"</p> <p>Cameron made his announcement in response to mounting concerns over rising household energy bills \u2013 four of the UK's big six energy firms have already announced above-inflation winter price hikes.</p> <p>After the announcement, a spokesman for the PM said: \"We've asked energy companies to take action themselves and make clear what the lowest available deals are. The point is, in practice this market is not operating for everyone. A small minority of people are actually switching deals, therefore we need to push some of this responsibility on to the energy companies.\"</p> <p>He said customers would have to wait until the bill was published, possibly in the autumn, for details of how the change would work in practice. The move did not mean energy companies would offer only one tariff, as different customers would need different rates. \"At the moment, the way the market works, people are encouraged to switch but many people don't \u2026 so lots of people are not benefiting from that market, particularly vulnerable people who are less likely to switch deals.\"</p> <p>Citizens Advice is launching the Big Energy Saving Week on 22 October to target millions of families across the UK with advice on keeping energy bills down.</p> <p>The campaign coincides with a warning from the price comparison site energyhelpline.com that the best fixed rate energy deals \u2013 including deals from Ovo Energy and First Utility \u2013 were \"disappearing fast\".</p> <p>The government will outline plans on Thursday for a new \u00a3160m gas market infrastructure. It will \"remove an ambiguity\" in the Gas Act to make it easier for Ofgem to launch an innovation competition that could attract \u00a3160m of extra investment. The Electricity Act will also be amended so developers will only need to undertake a three-month consultation if they want to change plans to incorporate the most energy-efficient measures.</p> <p>In the final announcement Davey will say that reforms in the energy bill will unlock \u00a3110bn of new investment in the electricity market.</p>",
  "<p>Every summer, jobbing academics experience the same shock. After months of marking word-processed essays, you are confronted with exam scripts and you see the thing itself: handwriting \u2013 reams of it. Whatever the varying qualities of all the different students' different essays over the year, print has invested them with a semblance of uniformity. Now you can really see the sheer variety of hands and, it would seem, personalities. The pile of handwritten essays is a kind of visual cacophony \u2013 spiky or looped or crabbed or wandering, with every shade of blue or black, every kind of pressure and slant and flourish. They could not look more different from each other.</p> <p>Philip Hensher's celebration of handwriting and the individuality it enacts comes at a time when, because of technology, this once essential human activity seems \"about to vanish from our lives altogether\". Everything is typed or texted. The apparent demise of handwriting is nothing much to do with educational ideology. Hensher notes that the National Curriculum makes rather stern demands of a child's handwriting skills, describing the seven levels through which a young person must pass to get from the basic shapes and orientation of letters to a script that is not only legible but \"attractive\". Yet to some (including a few of his more benighted creative writing students, it would seem) handwriting is simply unnecessary.</p> <p>Reading this book reminds you of the aura that a specimen of handwriting can have \u2013 all the more so as it becomes a rarer thing. Literary manuscripts perhaps most vividly preserve the heat of a person's singularity. Keats's letters are wonderful to read in print, but look at an actual letter in a photograph or a museum's glass case and you see something more. \"This living hand, now warm and capable\" reaches towards you. From Alexander Pope's disconcertingly perfect and pretty script to Byron's slapdash rapidity to Sylvia Plath's wobbly yet decisive jottings, struggling to find invisible lines and margins, handwriting seems to show us how an extraordinary person felt as well as what he or she wrote.</p> <p>As handwriting matters very much to those who study literary authors, so its significance recurs in many literary works. Some of the best chapters here are the self-contained studies of particular writers. There is a brilliant little piece on how handwriting features in Dickens's novels, where so often \"the act of writing, of forming letters, acts as an impetus for the plot\". Most will remember <a href=\"http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15947\" title=\"\">Lady Dedlock in <em>Bleak House</em></a> suddenly glimpsing a sample of her dead lover's handwriting, but Hensher gathers many more examples. You realise that Dickens had a thing about it.</p> <p>Another chapter fixes on Proust's odd predilection for illegibility in the letters of some of his friends, turned to revealing account when we see how illegible handwriting features in the plot of <a href=\"http://www.tempsperdu.com/\" title=\"\"><em>A la recherche du temps perdu</em></a>. Legibility being potentially \"shallow and cruel\", the impenetrability of a person's script becomes a metaphor for their complexity. Proust's narrator is, we are made to see, excited by the mysterious signs of individuality he detects and tries to describe in a person's handwriting.</p> <p>What for the novelist is a fascinating hypothesis became a pseudo-scientific creed in the work of graphologists. In the late 19th century, there was \"an explosion in books explaining how to discern character from handwriting\". <a href=\"http://www.literature.org/authors/doyle-arthur-conan/sign-of-four/\" title=\"\">Sherlock Holmes's certainty in <em>The Sign of Four</em> </a>that he could divine a suspect's character from the way he formed his letters (\"There is vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals\") was a habit of his times. What started as a Victorian parlour game became a weirdly respected science. It is shocking to discover that, in the late 20th century, leading European and American companies might still have been using graphology in making their recruitment decisions.</p> <p>Hensher thinks that the idea of handwriting as distinctive of an individual came only in the 19th century, and he specifies court cases in which this was first enshrined in law. Yet this cannot quite be right. The 18th-century novelist <a href=\"http://theburneysociety-uk.net/\" title=\"\">Fanny Burney</a> sedulously disguised her handwriting in the 1770s to prevent being outed as the author of <em>Evelina</em>, while in the 1720s <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/jonathan-swift-9500342\" title=\"\">Jonathan Swift </a>had a friend write out the copy of <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> supplied to his publisher so that his authorship would not be recognised.</p> <p>Here, as sometimes elsewhere, the historical generalisation comes a little too easily. And, disappointingly, Hensher does not go back very far. There is a spirited rumination on the qualities of Elizabeth I's signature, but otherwise nothing much on handwriting before the 18th century. The book does not reach back to the English manuscript culture that keeps palaeographers in business \u2013 the alien conventions of the \"secretary hand\" beloved of Elizabethans, the beautiful strangeness of the hands used by medieval scribes.</p> <p>He really gets going in the 18th century with the development of copperplate, \"still the hand we reach for at elevated moments of our lives\" (you see it replicated in printed form on certain kinds of invitation, especially to weddings). Oddly, it is preserved in the official logo of Coca-Cola. Then there was italic, developing from the faux antiquity of William Morris and hardening into the instructive books of Monica Bridges. It is a style that Hensher himself enjoys using, but one whose zealous proponents, influential in English public schools, he disdains. Quoting several stalwarts of the Italic Handwriting Society, he characteristically exclaims: \"What came first \u2013 being an arse, or writing in italics?\" One of the paradoxes of the story he tells is that, while handwriting is an expression of individuality, self-appointed experts have always strived to regularise it.</p> <p>The history explains how different nations have different handwriting habits as a result of past projects of regimentation. The Germans have only fairly recently extricated themselves from enslavement (for such it seems) to the Fraktur script that approximates to black-letter prints. Americans distantly owe their preferences to AN Palmer, whose <em>Guide to Business Writing</em> established the connection between his method for forming letters and commercial success. The heroine of Hensher's story is Marion Richardson, proponent of child-centred learning, whose 1935 manual <em>Writing and Writing Patterns</em> formalised her advocacy of children's delight in scribbles and patterns. In her educational practice Hensher finds a pleasure in idiosyncrasy that he shares.</p> <p>This pleasure licenses his own digressive and colloquial style (a footnote that begins \"This is nothing to do with anything \u2026\" gives you the tone of voice). The anti-solemn footnote is his speciality. He quotes a Scottish headmaster who doubts the importance of training in handwriting and his footnote performs a tizzy of exasperation. \"Oh, crap. Seriously, what crap \u2026 Jesus, sometimes you really want to give up\". Some digressions, such as his capsule history of ballpoint pens, serve a good purpose; others, such as a long account of trying to buy a fountain pen with an italic nib at various leading West End stores, do not. The historical descriptions and case studies are interleaved with space-filling transcripts of chats he has had with relatives and friends. They may show that individuals do think and care about handwriting, but they contain not a single observation that has stayed with me.</p> <p>The book ends with an anecdote about his experience of finding a notebook filled with the jottings of someone who had recently died. It is a telling example of how the very flow and contour of handwriting gives back something of the person who produced it. Many readers will know what it is to come upon the handwriting of someone they once cared for who is now dead, and to feel the shock of proximity. As much as any photograph, and more than any sound or video recording, handwriting can bring back to us the essential character of a person.</p> <p>\"Writing this book, I've come to the conclusion that handwriting is good for us. It involves us in a relationship with the written word which is sensuous, immediate, and individual. It opens our personality out to the world.\" You have to agree. As a history, <em>The Missing Ink</em> is patchy and too anecdotal for its own good, but its advocacy of one of the most humane and pleasurable forms of self-expression is pretty much irresistible.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan's <em>What Matters in Jane Austen</em> is published by Bloomsbury.</p>",
  "<h2>Colin Cram, consultant specialising in public sector procurement and a former director of the <a href=\"http://www.nwcope.org.uk/\" title=\"\">North West Centre of Excellence</a></h2> <p><strong>Procurement is a prisoner </strong>to how the public sector is organised, ie, its organisation is internally facing. It needs to be organised in a way that enables it to deal most effectively with the private sector. In areas where it is essential to get it right for quality as well as price, such as NHS drugs procurement, there is a central team doing it on behalf of the whole devolved NHS structure. The same principles should apply to other procurements. The procurements may be diverse, but for major projects many of the skills required are the same.</p> <p><strong>Service level agreements </strong>would ensure that internal public sector customers got what they wanted. Fortunately for it, public sector procurement has no external competitors. The status quo is, therefore, preferable for those who work in it. As things stand, there will never be enough specialist expertise to go round the several thousand public sector procurement organisations. Therefore, things will go obviously wrong. Who would know if one is paying far too much for a contract? Staff reductions of up to 30% can still result in a much better procurement service? Who would want that? Certainly not many procurement people.</p> <p><strong>The EU procurement directives </strong>are used as an excuse,<strong> </strong>but they have not caused problems in securing value for money through best practice, such as working up and down supply chains to take out unnecessary cost and risk. It is worth noting that, without the EU directives, Virgin is unlikely to have had a successful appeal. The directives have forced improved procurement standards in many parts of the UK public sector. The more capable and savvy procurement directors have used them effectively as an argument to get increased staff resources and investment in systems and training.</p> <p><strong>Coherent might be a better word </strong>than centralisation. We need a coherent organisation that is based on central, regional local structure, ensuring markets and suppliers are properly managed and specialist and commodity expertise is available to all. It would also provide procurement people with a great career structure and probably a much better structure for training them. Imagine the depth of outsourcing expertise that such an organisation could possess. Many suppliers find the lack of experience and specialist expertise in the organisations with which they are dealing to be extremely frustrating and costly. Others simply take advantage of it.</p> <h2>Stephanie Elsy, managing director of a business delivering efficiency in public services. Previously senior director of <a href=\"http://www.serco.com/\" title=\"\">Serco Group</a></h2> <p><strong>Social value depends </strong>on the determination of the commissioner to get it from the provider:<strong> </strong>they must include social outcomes in the selection criteria. If it is not explict, it won't happen because the bidders will not cost it in. This can be done and is being done. One of my favourite examples is the original contract that <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">TfL</a> had with Serco for the <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2632.aspx\" title=\"\">Docklands Light Railway</a> - there were explicit requirements around local community engagement and employment practises.</p> <p><strong>Government procurement </strong>is done under appalling public scrutiny; the private sector does not have to cope with this and can, unless it is of a fatal magnitude, hide its mistakes. There needs to be a centralised, mandatory procurement function, but I think it should be under Treasury or Cabinet Office control, not separate from government. This is what most large businesses do \u2013 and it works for the most part.</p> <p><strong>The media picture </strong>of the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for Transport </a>could be an incomplete, distorted picture. All I would say is that people make mistakes and, for a disaster to happen, it usually takes quite a few people to make mistakes or not do what they are supposed to do. As my history teacher used to say, the one thing we learn from history is that people never learn from history. Pay may be an issue in retaining experienced people, but I suspect other factors, such as lack of resources, organisational turmoil with cuts and poor systems, could also have played a part \u2013 but this is speculation.</p> <h2>Paul Kennedy, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.cel.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">CEL Group</a>, which provides procurement and business services to public bodies</h2> <p><strong>Data and technology </strong>have a huge role to play in the areas of commoditised procurement. The standardisation and availability of the data, to support meaningful analysis remain the problem. A recent report on behalf of the Government in the Republic of Ireland showed that, out of a total spend of \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.3bn) on goods and services, \u20ac6.9bn was classed as \"addressable by procurement\". Some \u20ac4.3bn was thought to be addressable centrally, \u20ac2.1bn to be sector specific and, interestingly \u20ac0.5bn remained unclassified because of the poor quality of data.</p> <h2>Su Maddock, senior fellow at the <a href=\"https://research.mbs.ac.uk/innovation/\" title=\"\">Manchester Institute for Innovation Research</a> </h2> <p><strong>Procurement is being used </strong>as a panacea for achieving often conflicting objectives. For instance, the Department for Work and Pensions expected work programme procurement to deliver service innovation, efficiency savings and to transfer risk from the taxpayer to the private sector all through a neat two-tier model. Now even prime contractors are challenging the assumptions made and say they cannot afford the development costs of social innovation. There is a need for much more openness about commissioners (political) expectations and analysis of whether the business and procurement models adopted can deliver expectations.</p> <p><strong>Procurement officials </strong>are constrained by broader frameworks. All small organisations find public processes difficult. If commissioners prioritise \"transferring risk\" that cuts out even medium-sized companies. It seems to me that adding on social values clauses is not going to overcome these structural problems. Within the civil service and the wider public sector there has grown up a set of assumptions around what business models lead to efficiencies and that these not challenged enough \u2013 all models having a gearing, and it is frequently towards rationalisation rather than supporting the relationships that are shown to support holistic services. Rather than searching for the most effective national procurement services, I think locality commissioners are more likely to procure from who have a track record in inter-agency.</p> <p><strong>Richard Branson did us a favour </strong>by challenging the Department for Transport. Whatever you think of Virgin, he did reveal to the public that government procurement decisions are quite often based on delusional claims to win contracts. I think it is a problem in a democracy that policies are fought over but that transactional processes are assumed to be neutral, when they're not.</p> <h2>Adrian Quayle, managing director of P&amp;Q Consulting, and a board member of the <a href=\"http://www.noa.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Outsourcing Association</a> </h2> <p><strong>Time is crucial. </strong>Those that work well have properly considered what they are trying to achieve, such as outcomes and benefits. They haven't just jumped straight into procurement on a cost and risk basis. The existence of this strategy and feasibility stage is essential and needn't take long but is often omitted in the rush to get into evaluation and contractual discussions. It's absence then impedes the process as much of the thinking, then has to be \"retro-fitted\" into the selection and contractual process. This is even more difficult to do in formal <a href=\"http://www.ojeu.eu/WhatIsTheOJEU.aspx\" title=\"\">OJEU</a>-based public procurement.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><a href=\"http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/Assessment-and-Certification-services/Management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BS-11000-Collaborative-Relationship-Management-Systems/\" title=\"\"><strong>British Standard on Collaborative Business Relationships</strong></a><strong> </strong>is gaining traction. The challenges of large and complex collaborative relationships were among the triggers for its development. The two parts of the standard set out good industry practices across the whole of the lifecycle (including procurement). The standard is beginning to get significant traction in a wide range of organisations across the private and public sectors \u2013 more than 25 have now certified against it.</p> <p><strong>Mentoring is necessary.</strong> In the private sector over recent years, much work has been carried out in establishing highly professional supplier relationship management (SRM) functions and teams. The skills they have increasingly focused on have been the softer aspects of culture and behaviours as part of broader performance management. The involvement of these teams in the procurement process is now recognised as essential. A significant number of these SRMs have been through the university accredited National Outsourcing Association <a href=\"http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/pathway/\" title=\"\">pathway programme</a>. An extension of this into the public sector will provide capabilities and the alumni are already acting as a very effective support structure. We've also seen significant development in coaching and developing through the rise of mentoring organisations operating in this area.</p> <h2>Nigel Clifford, chief executive of the e-commerce network <a href=\"http://www.procserve.com/\" title=\"\">Procserve</a></h2> <p><strong>The challenge </strong>is sometimes making the intangible tangible. I was lucky enough to be in the NHS for six years (I mean that). It was the most complex but satisfying buying and supplying environment I have worked in \u2013 needing very deep thought on priorities and justifications that can be defended against a price-cost benchmark. A happy ward environment or a good patient experience needed a strong multifunctional buying team to define what lay beneath the outcome and how to communicate it quantitatively.</p> <p><strong>Sharing best practice </strong>is essential, both through sharing personnel as on secondment, using <a href=\"http://www.cips.org/aboutcips/mycips/\" title=\"\">Charted Institute of Purchasing and Supply</a> tools and resources and using the contracts and systems that are available. However, it is important that this is inclusive and builds the talent pool rather than alienating the public servants who are the constant in the procurement function. We need champions to whom ambitious twentysomethings can aspire to be in the future. Is procurement sexy enough and seen as a great and meaningful career? Personally I think it is and should be.</p> <h2>Tim Heywood, specialist public procurement and commercial lawyer </h2> <p><strong>The </strong><a href=\"http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Government Procurement Service</strong></a><strong> and civil servants </strong>handling commercial contracting are not well-supported. They handle what are often highly complex, high-profile matters and they have to do it with very modest resourcing. Their specialism is not fully recognised or valued in Whitehall, although this is improving, but those who do choose to specialise in procurement in the civil service are generally very capable and industrious.</p> <p><strong>There is a short term resourcing and capabilities issue </strong>about how to increase the overall levels of commercial awareness, negotiating skills and nous in the civil service. Training and development are certainly part of the solution. But they will deliver medium and longer term solutions. A collaborative approach which brings in the best of the public and private sector procurement and contracting capability is needed to address the short-term challenge.</p> <p><strong>The decision-making issue </strong>is a vital one but commercial nous can't be taught: I worked in Whitehall for 15 years or so. Much of that time was spent on commercial matters. This is a good thing obviously, but it cannot be a substitute for a number of skills and abilities. Commercial nous is probably one of them. I'm not sure it can be taught: you've either got it or you haven't. Negotiation, too, requires the individual to have certain personal characteristics. It is not something you can do by rote. So some of this capability (people who already have these skills) needs to be identified and deployed more effectively so that they can add the value that's needed. If it can't be identified and deployed from internal resources quickly enough, it will need to be bought in.</p> <h2>Andy Moran, director of <a href=\"http://www.planprocuremanage.com/\" title=\"\">Plan Procure Manage</a> </h2> <p><strong>External consultants </strong>find it easier to challenge service delivery managers in a way that procurement departments would not. I think a lot of this is to do with the service-delivery-led structure of most councils. Traditionally, procurement has been a reactive support service within maybe the finance department and not had a seat at the top table.</p> <p><strong>Changing expectations </strong>for public sector procurement is at the root, the whole reason for this debate. What is it we expect public sector procurement people to do and, actually, is there more than one type of procurement person. The technical procurement knowledge is really a very small part of the story for a public sector procurement person. It's becoming more and more about business analysis, project management and political awareness.</p> <p><strong>Narrow thinking </strong>must be dispensed with. A few years ago I did some work with a local authority to renegotiate care home contracts and introduce payments linked to quality standards. What struck me most of all was that, when I went out to visit the homes and meet the suppliers, that for all of them it was the first time they had met anyone from the council procurement and commissioning teams. Some of these care homes were being paid over \u00a31m a year.</p> <h2>Gary Bandy, freelance consultant and a former local authority finance director </h2> <p><strong>Local government </strong>procurement hierarchies need adjusting. I don't think I know of any local authority where a procurement specialist is at the top table. There has been a continuing debate for years in local government about whether the finance director should be a member of the top management team, and many authorities do not do it. Private companies that have a significant supply chain would likely have a board director responsible for it. As local authorities, and other public bodies, move further towards a commissioning model, is there a case for them to have a commercial director on their top team?</p> <p><strong>EU procurement objectives </strong>is a way to scrutinise public bodies<strong> </strong>and gives the public confidence.<em> </em>However, over recent years I've detected a growing unease among organisations about the potential for challenge from unsuccessful bidders (and others). I suppose the recent successful appeal by Virgin Trains will exacerbate this uneasiness.</p> <p><strong>If localism is to mean anything </strong>then public bodies should commission bespoke services. This is rather than have a centrally-procured service imposed on them. That's assuming a central unit could, for instance, commission a contract that could be easily implemented piecemeal across the country.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

  "<p>International cricket, albeit of the unofficial kind, is due to return to Pakistan this weekend, for the first time since the Sri Lanka team were attacked in their bus on the way to a Test in Lahore in March 2009. An International World XI team captained by Sanath Jayasuriya, managed by Alvin Kallicharan, and including a number of intrepid South Africans such as Andre Nel has been assembled to play a couple of Twenty20 matches against a Pakistan All Stars XI team at the National Stadium in Karachi on <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2012/10/16/organisers-promise-foolproof-security-for-world-xi-matches/\" title=\"http://dawn.com/2012/10/16/organisers-promise-foolproof-security-for-world-xi-matches/\">Saturday and Sunday</a>.</p> <p>The Pakistan Cricket Board has stressed that the games are unofficial, having left security arrangements in the hands of Mohammad Ali Shah, the sports minister of the Sind province, and the rest of his team who came up with the idea. But it has allowed such high-profile contracted players as Shahid Afridi and Younis Khan to take part in the fixtures, and clearly hope that if they go ahead successfully, it will be another major step towards convincing the cricketing world that playing in Pakistan does not constitute an unacceptable risk.</p> <p>Staging the matches will be a triumph for Pakistan, and cricket, to celebrate, at a time when the country is still recovering from the shock of the shooting of Malala Yousafzai, the 14-year-old schoolgirl who is now in hospital in Birmingham after being shot in the Swat Valley by a Taliban gunman for daring to press the case for female education.</p> <p>In that context, the development and success of the Pakistan women's team in recent years seems to be a more relevant cause for celebration. Less than two decades ago, the idea that women could play cricket to a high standard and even represent the country provoked angry protests, and was even <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/219995.html\" title=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/219995.html\">forbidden by the government</a>. Now, they have a full-time contracted squad, who are currently preparing to leave for the Asia Cup in China after making a hugely positive impression in the ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka \u2013 where they claimed a thrilling victory against India by one run.</p> <p>\"This is the reality of modern Pakistan,\" said Ayesha Ashhar, the manager of the team, from her office in Lahore. \"Since we won the Asian Games two years ago, which was a major breakthrough for women's cricket, but even before that, there has been no objection. People accept that women can play cricket, and they come to watch women playing cricket as they would men.\"</p> <p>The Pakistan team have an eloquent ambassador in Sana Mir, the 26-year-old from Abbottabad who was one of the stars of a brunch to promote the women's game held in Colombo on the day of the World T20 finals. \"It was a great moment for us that Sana was invited to speak at that function, and to represent the whole of women's cricket,\" added Ashhar. \"I respect and admire her so much, not only for her cricketing ability, but also for the leadership qualities she shows.\"</p> <p>Next week she will lead her girls to Guangzhou, of all places, for an intriguing eight-team tournament that involves Thailand, Hong Kong, Nepal and the hosts China, as well as the established quartet of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India \u2013 who will be set on revenge when they face Mir's team in the <a href=\"http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/tournaments/acc-womens-twenty20-asia-cup-2012\" title=\"http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/tournaments/acc-womens-twenty20-asia-cup-2012\">last round of group matches</a> on 28 October.</p> <p>Sri Lanka also claimed a completely unexpected win in the World T20 against West Indies who were widely fancied to challenge Australia in the semi finals \u2013 only for the Aussies to shock England in the final, an against-the-odds achievement that perhaps has not received suitable recognition in England given the gulf in the support given to the women's game in the two nations.</p> <p>For all the warm words about the growing profile of women's cricket that have followed, with the England captain Charlotte Edwards and other members of her team touring the BBC for a round of <a href=\"http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/tournaments/acc-womens-twenty20-asia-cup-2012\" title=\"http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/tournaments/acc-womens-twenty20-asia-cup-2012\">pretty soft interviews</a>, the performance department at the England and Wales Cricket Board will presumably be asking some tough questions about the team's failure to perform to their potential in that final. The pressure will now be high on them to deliver in the 50-over World Cup early next year in India \u2013 if women's cricket is to be taken as seriously as it deserves, that level of criticism and accountability must be accepted as part of the package. In Pakistan, the team's apparently widespread acceptance at home is a cause for greater celebration in itself.</p>",
  "<p>The chief of the Taliban in Pakistan has ordered his followers to target media organisations critical of the group's attempt to murder 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai.</p> <p>The scathing media coverage of the Taliban for the shooting, in Pakistan and elsewhere, is said to have enraged Hakeemullah Mehsud, head of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p> <p>He has therefore issued directives to his subordinates in the Pakistani cities of Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad to target certain television channels and their editorial staff. And journalists in Swat have received threatening phone calls warning them of serious consequences for giving coverage to the Yousafzai case.</p> <p>Intelligence agencies intercepted a phone conversation between Mehsud and a TTP operative in which he gave the directives to attack media organisations.</p> <p>Yousafzai, who was flown to Britain on Monday, is said by doctors to have a good chance of making a recovery. She was shot because she advocated education for girls. But the TTP regard her as a \"spy of the west\".</p> <p>She has become a potent symbol of resistance against the Taliban's efforts to deprive girls of an education. A TTP statement said: \"We did not attack her for raising voice for education. We targeted her for opposing mujahideen and their war.

  "<p>Is the economy really in as bad a state as certain sections of the media would have everyone believe? Not if the audience and some of the panellists at a recent small business panel in Leicester are right. Things are more difficult than they were five years ago, certainly, but despite bouts of what one panellist called \"Pestonitis\" in honour of the BBC correspondent, some businesses are reporting their best-ever year.</p> <p>The main thrust of the initial debate, though, was about opening new markets. Chairing the event, the Guardian's industrial editor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/danmilmo\" title=\"\">Dan Milmo</a> introduced Philip Taylor, international business manager, Northants Beds Bucks &amp; Herts, for Lloyds TSB. He said one of the biggest issues with exporting and creating new markets was that too many people ask for advice on exporting too late. \"It's sadly too frequent that someone comes to me with a contract and says 'I've signed this, enlighten me a bit on the payment methods', and I have to say, 'you've already signed the contract, so you're tied into it'.\" Sources of advice such as UK Trade &amp; Investment were also ignored by many small businesses until too late, he said.</p> <p>Being flexible and ready to adjust to what is actually going on are also very important, according to Professor Simon Lilley, head of Leicester University's school of management. \"We've been working with a local taxi firm that has been hit by the austerity measures,\" he explained. Cuts have meant that a lot of the customers, for a firm servicing social services and education clients, have reduced taxi use. \"So the firm started examining cost bases and revenue streams, and began by looking at keeping the vehicles on the road longer and taking down maintenance costs.</p> <p>\"They've done that so phenomenally well that their business is now developing into 'we'll keep your car on the road', and they're running a taxi firm on the side,\" he said.</p> <p>The lesson here was to look at where a business is uniquely placed to make an offering regardless of whether it's the same one as a year ago.</p> <p>The flipside is that inflexible businesses might suffer, although Alice Barnard, chief executive of the Peter Jones Foundation, still found that attitudes in the media were impeding confidence \u2013 a theme that had been raised in other seminars.</p> <p>\"Negativity is the antithesis of everything an entrepreneur stands for,\" she said. \"I'd be an advocate of banning phrases like 'since records began' \u2026 we know where we are, we know roughly how it came about, so let's stop talking about that and work out where we're going next.\"</p> <p>One audience member suggested that the whole focus had to shift from increasing sales, whether through new markets or not, which is difficult at the moment, to making those sales more profitable. Panellist Ron Lynch, regional director of the IoD East Midlands, agreed. \"A lot of businesses have re-costed things and as a result there is more profit around,\" he said. \"The problem is they're not investing at the moment.\" There was a need both to generate more sales and to invest in growth, he added.</p> <p>A lively exchange towards the end of the session involved one member of the audience suggesting that too many new entrepreneurs have missed the business basics but still have a sense of entitlement. \"Banks have made mistakes, but I wouldn't lend someone money unless I could get some assurance on their plan and the finance behind it,\" he said. \"You're talking basic stuff here.\"</p> <p>He suggested there was a media-led impression that people had to get a university education in order to get a job, implicitly endorsed by successive governments, but his organisation had successfully taken on school leavers at 16. \"You don't have to have a degree unless you want to be a solicitor or something, it's all getting too complicated,\" he said.</p> <p>Barnard's colleagues in the audience defended the training on offer at least from the Peter Jones Foundation, which offered business planning, and the ability to present to and work with backers, among similar basics. The audience member felt this was good but that overall there was too much emphasis on getting overqualified without the required commonsense. \"The world is not the kind of place the media has portrayed,\" he said. \"Since 2009, yes, the world is tough but there's no use moaning about it, it's not as bad as has been made out.\"</p> <p>A lot of business success was about staying in control, said Lynch. One of his contacts had been asked what it was like running her business, and she had said it was like pulling a cart, with all the customers, suppliers and staff on it. \"Someone said to her, you've got it the wrong way around, you should be on the cart and the others pulling you,\" he said. \"It took something like that for her to see the opportunities for her business.\" She subsequently appointed a non-executive chairman and chief executive to turn the company around.</p> <p>Mostly, though, growth is about business acumen and sometimes being tough enough, the panel agreed. In previous times, it had been possible to ask the bank for a loan and get it easily enough. While it's not impossible now, anyone asking for money needs to have the mindset of a financial director, the ability to not only ask for money but to say precisely what they plan to do with it.</p> <p>Lynch summed it up by recalling an analogy that had been explained to him a while ago. There are three sorts of business, first the lions, who are predatory, go out and find new markets. Then the mules, the reliable enough but uninspiring ones who form around 80% of the economy \u2013 and the turkeys, who need no explanation. The trick, he said, was to get some of the mules to think about being lions \u2013 and to get the lions some profile to inspire further mules.</p> <p><em>The </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/small-business-network\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Small Business Network</em></a><em> and Lloyds TSB Commercial will be running 12 regional seminars in total, in conjunction with the Institute of Directors.

  "<p>I brake suddenly, faced with a large dark shape on the road. The beast runs off into the woods before I get a closer look but thanks to numerous travel reports of wild boar hogging the roads around East Sussex, its identity is obvious. When not causing traffic jams, they are a celebrated local delicacy.</p> <p>Rye has an annual event devoted to them. <a href=\"http://wildboar.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wild Boar week</a>, starting on 27 October, sees exhibitions, quiz nights, parties and, happily, a plethora of restaurants serving the meat up in all shapes and sizes, as pressed belly, in black pudding, steaks, sausages, stews, cured as charcuterie and every other conceivable way.</p> <p>\"Genuine wild boar, as opposed to farmed, is a truly local product,\" says the festival's organiser, Oliver Campion. \"This is one of very few parts of the country where a lot of wild boar roam the woods.\"</p> <p>The animals were once common on the English landscape before being hunted to extinction during the 17th century. Around 15 years ago, according to the <a href=\"http://www.britishwildboar.org.uk\">British Wild Boar</a> organisation, they began to re-emerge in the woods and forests of Sussex. It's thought they must have escaped from farms, been dumped by illegal importers or set free by animal rights activists. However they got there, they began doing what animals do \u2013 breeding.</p> <p>By the turn of the millennium, wild boar colonies were established in East Sussex, Kent, Gloucestershire and Devon. There are thought to be between <a href=\"http://www.britishwildboar.org.uk/index.htm?britain.htm\" title=\"\">500 and 1,000 animals in the UK now</a> although there are concerns that the population in some areas is under threat. Unlike other types of game there is no official boar-hunting season, no time when they are allowed to breed and wean their young with impunity. The <a href=\"http://www.basc.org.uk/\">British Association for Shooting and Conservation</a> advises that firearms certificates should be authorised to shoot wild boar. Two dogs can be used to track animals, but they can't be hunted in packs.</p> <p>\"Four or five years ago the boar in this area were out of control,\" says Alistair Ball, a forester in East Sussex. \"People began shooting them and now the numbers are dwindling.\" This concerns Sussex butcher, Jamie Wickens, who sells fresh wild boar meat from his <a href=\"http://www.shipwinchelseabeach.com/deli/\" title=\"\">premises in Winchelsea Beach</a>. He wants Defra to create an official hunting season so the animal does not die out in the wild here a second time. \"I sell genuine wild boar during the game season but with no law against it others may not be so scrupulous.\"</p> <p>Brought up cooking wild boar in the Lombardy region in his native Italy (where numbers continue to thrive), Gabriele Pastellanza, chef at <a href=\"http://www.thegeorgeinrye.com/\" title=\"\">The George in Rye</a> now serves it in a variety of forms. \"It's a very versatile ingredient,\" he says. \"Because the animal is wild it's more meaty and has a much richer flavour than farmed meat.\"</p> <p>The authentic unfarmed meat has a distinctive texture and bears little resemblance to pork, looks more like steak, tastes like a cross between organic pork and venison; like other game, it's a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/boar\" title=\"\">great hearty, nourishing meat</a>, best served on crisp autumnal days or cold winter nights.</p> <p>Although it's possible to <a href=\"http://www.britishwildboar.org.uk/index.htm?Suppliers.htm\" title=\"\">buy farmed wild boar elsewhere throughout the year</a>, it is the rarity and superior flavour of authentic wild boar that makes it such a prized delicacy, from butchers and farmers' markets in the areas where the animals roam.</p> <p>Our local travel news still regularly warns to avoid the beasts on the roads. I'd prefer to come across them at the local butcher or in one of the pubs and restaurants in UK wild boar territory.</p>",
  "<p>Healthcare managers will be gathering for the <a href=\"http://www.foundationtrustnetwork.org/home/\" title=\"\">Foundation Trust Network</a> conference next week at a time of growing confusion as to how the health reforms are going to operate.</p> <p>The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, appears unwilling to read from the script that Andrew Lansley left him. There are strong indications in his first few weeks that he does not recognise the wall that is being erected between the politicians and the NHS under the new regime, and is repeatedly pushing into territory which Sir David Nicholson and the NHS Commissioning Board regard as theirs.</p> <p>And, just as the new minister starts behaving like an official with operational control, Nicholson has been behaving like a politician. His <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/13/david-nicholson-fears-nhs-reforms\">recent comments to a conference of GPs</a> were extraordinary. He said: \"Big, high-profile, politically driven objectives and changes like this almost always end in misery and failure.\" He is right, of course, but it is all but unprecedented for someone of permanent secretary rank, in effect, to ridicule government policy in this way.</p> <p>Is this how the new separation of powers in the NHS is going to work \u2013 ministers trying to interfere on the one hand and the commissioning board feeling it has the autonomy to attack government policy on the other? If the commissioning board is going to have a row with the government, money is the likely battleground. All parts of the provider system are feeling the pressure.</p> <p>It is tempting to divide foundation trusts into two camps: those who are struggling and those who are thriving. It is certainly true that small district general hospitals and those with PFI deals tend to be the ones finding it hardest to adapt to the new financial climate, but even the big foundation trusts are finding it tough. All of them are plagued by uncertainty \u2014 about income, about the impact of commissioning changes, about reconfiguration.</p> <p>The Nicholson challenge to achieve \u00a320bn of efficiency savings is not going to be met. The <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/\" title=\"\">King's Fund</a>'s quarterly monitoring report published in September said finance directors from a range of organisations were on track to achieve their planned cost improvements for this year, but many already see little chance of the overall target being hit.</p> <p>Monitor's review of foundation trust plans for 2012-13 predicts savings will exceed 4% for each of the next two years, but that is not going to do the job. In this first 18 months of the challenge, trusts have been stripping out the easily identifiable inefficiencies and benefiting from the pay freeze. But the freeze cannot go on much longer and further savings will be much harder to deliver.</p> <p>If there was to be any chance of saving \u00a320bn the early progress would have needed to be much more dramatic. This will increase pressure for reconfiguration of services and sorting out uneconomic trusts.</p> <p>There seems to be some appetite among foundation trusts for taking over struggling trusts, but the risks must weigh heavily on any hospital board. The slump in the performance of <a href=\"http://www.heartofengland.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Heart of England foundation trust</a> after it took over ailing <a href=\"http://www.heartofengland.nhs.uk/templates/Page____7707.aspx\" title=\"\">Good Hope</a> serves as a powerful warning of the likely consequences of trying to resuscitate a failing hospital.</p> <p>Many foundation trusts are finding it tough enough to manage waiting lists and A&amp;E access times without taking on someone else's problems. There are also nerves about local opposition. Foundation trusts considering a takeover struggle to align local opinion-formers \u2013 MPs, councillors and the media. That is a lot of pain for little obvious benefit to the foundation trust.</p> <p>In the short term at least, foundation trusts are likely to suffer from the growing pains of clinical commissioning groups. Monitor expects groups will struggle to manage demand for their first year, and foundation trusts that try to meet demand substantially above the level they had planned for often see their profitability weakened. This shows the folly of launching a wholesale reorganisation in the middle of a financial crisis.</p> <p>The difficulties faced by foundation trusts are extensive and deep. Too many are finding it too difficult to adapt to the new health economy. Substantial restructuring is inevitable.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

He didn't do it. He had a Democrat House and Democrat Senate, super majority in both houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come here legally and for those that are here illegally today?\" Romney said.</p> <p>Obama sidestepped the question, listing changes to the immigration system he had made but not addressing why he failed to put a bill to Congress for comprehensive reform. </p> <p>However, while many Latino voters are unhappy with the president about that, there is little evidence they have confidence in Romney and the Republican party to address immigration in a way that is sympathetic to undocumented migrants. </p> <p>Romney's advert promises to unite families, provide work permits and find permanent solutions for undocumented youth living in the US. But he has offered only sketchy policy proposals and Obama noted that Romney's adviser on the issue was at the forefront of drawing up Arizona's controversial law permitting the police to challenge people over their immigration status.</p> <p>In a second Spanish-language advert released on Wednesday, Romney attacks Obama with allegations he has made more than $700m in cuts to Medicare \u2013 a theme the Republicans have repeatedly pressed during the campaign despite fact checkers saying the charge is false.</p>",
  "<p>A palatial pumphouse, an immense stone spillway and a London roundabout are among the 10 most threatened Victorian and Edwardian structures in England and Wales, according to a list published on Wednesday.</p> <p>The list, compiled by the Victorian Society, also includes an abandoned railway station in Derbyshire, an ivy-shrouded mortuary chapel in Salford and the country's first lending library, housed in Swindon's Mechanics Institute \u2013 all of which have fallen into a shocking state of disrepair.</p> <p>The publication follows a widespread appeal to find the best and most at risk buildings in England and Wales, with historians, enthusiasts and local campaigners suggesting endangered structures in their area.</p> <p>\"The public responded enthusiastically to our call for threatened buildings,\" said Chris Costelloe, director of the Victorian Society. \"It shows the public cares \u2013 but it also shows there are still too many historic buildings at risk, without recognition or protection.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397943787\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350489134523/Waterloo-Hotel-in-Smethwi-001.jpg\" alt=\"Waterloo Hotel in Smethwick\" width=\"220\" height=\"273\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waterloo Hotel in Smethwick. Photograph: Andrew Clayton/Victorian Society</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Clayton/Victorian Society</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the buildings follow a similar story, of redundant public facilities falling into private hands, after which they have been left to deteriorate. Ipswich county hall, built as the town's jail and law court, once boasted fine wooden panelling and stained glass windows. Sold off and left to decline, it has now been stripped of its copper and lead, its windows smashed and interiors vandalised.</p> <p>\"It was designed to instil awe and civic pride,\" says Costelloe. \"Now it only inspires pity and anger.\"</p> <p>A similar fate befell the Swindon Mechanics Institute. Built in 1855 and paid for by rail workers, it began a network of healthcare facilities that inspired the National Health Service. Nye Bevan, mastermind of the NHS, said: \"There was a complete health service in Swindon. All we had to do was expand it to the country.\"</p> <p>But since its closure in 1986, the building has fallen prey to vandalism and arson. The Victorian Society insists that a workable plan must be provided by the council if the building is to survive.</p> <p>Tumbling down a hillside in Marsden, West Yorkshire, the majestic stone steps of the Butterley spillway are also threatened. Its owner, Yorskhire Water, plans to upgrade the structure with a concrete replacement, as it fails to comply with current health and safety standards. But the Victorian Society argues that the kind of flooding the proposed structure seeks to manage may occur only once in 20,000 years.</p> <p>\"Whether the solution is restoration or finding a new use for a building, it always takes money and often a long time,\" says Costelloe. \"In the meantime it's vital that historic buildings are secured against weather and vandals. We owe it to future generations to ensure such memorable buildings are still around in 100 years. Most people now regret the demolition of the Euston Arch \u2013 we don't want to see other important examples of our history lost to neglect, crime or short term economic concerns.\"</p> <p>Also on the list is a fine red-brick pumphouse, with turrets and pointed arches, left crumbling on the edge of a container park in Bootle, Merseyside, as well as London's Holborn Circus, described by Dickens as \"perhaps \u2026 the finest piece of street architecture in the City\" \u2013 now threatened by a plan to move the central statue and close off one of the roads.</p>",

  "<p>How to write while looking after a very young baby: get a sling. Aim for the most supportive, ergonomic one you can find. Strap yourself in. After the mid-morning feed, while the baby is still in a post-milk trance, insert her into the sling with the minimum disturbance possible. Forget anything like&#xa0;clearing away the breakfast, emptying the washing&#xa0;machine, returning calls \u2013 even dressing. You&#xa0;won't be doing anything as rash as answering the&#xa0;door.</p> <p>Walk to your desk, averting your eyes from the heaps of&#xa0;laundry on the stairs, the drifts of cat hair on the carpets, the flotsam of toys in every doorway. Don't hurry. Don't indicate you have anything in mind other than a relaxing stroll. Use the swaying, rolling gait of an astronaut. Try not to show your excitement or your nerves. You are about to carve some time out of the day \u2013 you are about to step out of the chaos \u2013 but keep it light.&#xa0;Soothing murmurs at this point are optional but might help.</p> <p>Slide yourself into your chair and switch on the computer, having previously ensured the volume is turned right down, so the machine doesn't emit a sleep-shattering BONG in welcome. Everyone knows there is no more sombre enemy to good art than the broadband&#xa0;connection in the hallway, so disable your router immediately. Do not check your email, do not click on your favourites, do not check today's headlines, do not be tempted to see how your eBay auctions are faring: go to work, go directly to work.</p> <p>There is nothing more focusing than the awareness that your beloved infant may wake at any moment, that tiny, known body flexing and arching into consciousness, putting an end to work. The tension \u2013 will you get 20 minutes today, or 40, or even an hour? \u2013 will help encourage a little adrenaline, or so you tell yourself. You scroll through the paragraphs and find your place from yesterday, helpfully highlighted in block capitals.</p> <p>If you find yourself fogged by fatigue or blindsided by exhaustion, try a square or two of chocolate \u2013 dark and bitter. A glass of water or music can also help. Choose something that will transport you to the mood or time or atmosphere of whatever you are writing. Put it on repeat until you don't hear it any more.</p> <p>Write. The clickety-clackety of the keyboard will soothe her, and you. Write without looking back, without rereading. Write until your fingers are stiff, your shoulders sore, your eyes aching. Write until you feel her twisting her head from side to side, until you unstrap the sling, lifting her out and into your arms. You might be in the middle of a sentence but no matter. Type \"HERE\" in capitals and then push yourself away from the desk, carrying her out of the room, shutting the door until next time.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Maggie O'Farrell's latest novel is The Hand That First Held Mine (Headline Review)</em></p>",

  "<p>Police have warned the media to avoid filming or photographing the faces of anyone entering the first ever private abortion clinic on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said any film or pictures identifying clients or staff going into the building in central Belfast would be a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as UK law.</p> <p>The Marie Stopes clinic on Belfast's Great Victoria Street is scheduled to open on Thursday and is expected to become the focal point of protests by anti-abortion activists across Ireland, north and south.</p> <p>In advance of the clinic opening its doors, the PSNI issued advice that the media should pixelate the faces of any individual they may record entering the building.</p> <p>A PSNI spokesman said the request was in line with Article 8 of the ECHR, which has been enshrined in UK law. He said the PSNI had a duty under the legislation \"to protect a person's right to privacy from interference by others, in certain circumstances\".</p> <p>Marie Stopes' director for the UK and Ireland, Tracey McNeill, revealed that the sexual health charity had hired security staff to protect its workers and clients.</p> <p>Anti-abortion activists have said they will stage a mass protest outside the clinic at around lunchtime on Thursday. The founder of the pressure group Precious Life, Bernadette Smyth, said her supporters would observe \"three days of prayer and fasting\" to demonstrate their opposition to the clinic.</p> <p>Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply and has resulted in thousands of women from the province travelling to Britain and Europe for terminations.</p> <p>In the Irish Republic there is an absolute ban on all abortions and the opening of the abortion services, although limited, creates the prospect of women from the republic being able to legally terminate their pregnancies on the island for the first time.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's laws to tackle wildlife crime \u2013 such as the poisoning of birds of prey and illegal trading of species online \u2013 are a \"mess\", an influential committee of MPs said on Thursday.</p> <p>The report from the environmental audit committee comes amid fears over the funding of the police's <a href=\"http://www.north-wales.police.uk/nwcu/home.asp\" title=\"\">National Wildlife Crime Unit</a> (NWCU), which is due to expire in March next year and has not yet been guaranteed by the government.</p> <p>While laws to protect wildlife in the UK exist, the committee acknowledges, their power is undermined as they are \"scattered across various statutes and regulations\". The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told the committee \"conservation legislation is, in our view, badly in need of consolidation\".</p> <p>Several laws, such as the Night Poaching Act of 1828 and the Game Act of 1831, are archaic, for example, while the main legislation under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 is difficult for non-wildlife specialist lawyers to use. The <a href=\"http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/consultations/wildlife.htm\" title=\"\">Law Commission is currently consulting on wildlife laws</a>, which it calls \"a legal landscape that is out of date, confused and often contradictory.\"</p> <p>Prosecution of cases, such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/23/poisoned-peregrine-falcons-rspb-reward\" title=\"\">poisoning of peregrine falcons</a>, is also hampered by a lack of knowledge in the Crown Prosecution Service and \"inconsistent sentencing by judges and magistrates\", the report says. \"We have an issue with continuity with the CPS because there aren't specialist prosecutors for wildlife,\" Stephanie Pendry, enforcement programme leader at the wildlife trade monitoring NGO Traffic, told the committee.</p> <p>If successfully prosecuted, most wildlife crimes in the UK incur a maximum \u00a35,000 fine and/or a maximum sentence of six months.</p> <p>Joan Walley, the committee's chair, said: \"Police officers dealing with wildlife crime are having to wrestle with legal arrangements that are almost Pythonesque in their absurdity; like the requirement to summon a vet to take a sample from any endangered species entering the country \u2013 even if it happens to be a piece of mahogany furniture.</p> <p>\"Wildlife protection law in the UK is in a mess after being patched up too many times in an effort to keep pace with offending. The law needs to be consolidated and the courts need to be given clear sentencing guidelines.\"</p> <p>Uncertainty over the long-term funding of the NWCU is also undermining its ability to carry out enforcement, the committee heard, as it is constantly under review. Nevin Hunter, the head of the unit, said: \"\u2026 A lot of the challenge that I have is to constantly look at securing the future funding, which takes me away from that day-to-day role of trying to address wildlife crime.\"</p> <p>The unit is relatively small, with a staff of just 15, and its \u00a3397,000 funding largely split between the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Its funding for 2012-13 has already been cut 10% against 2011-12.</p> <p>Heather Sohl, senior species policy officer for WWF-UK said: \"Today, the committee has rightly acknowledged that the UK has made good progress in the last eight years, but to build on success we need the government to recognise that the NWCU needs long-term funding to help stop wildlife crime.\"</p> <p>Lord Henley, the then parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Defra, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenvaud/c140-iii/c14001.htm\" title=\"\">said in August</a> that he could not \"make any positive guarantee\" over the unit's funding, and even if a decision was taken to cease funding, \"other funds [are] going into policing and dealing with these matters\".</p> <p>Martin Harper, the RSPB's conservation director, said in 2011 there were 100 reports of poisoning incidents of birds of prey, highlighting the need for action: \"We are delighted that the environmental audit committee shares our concerns about wildlife crime \u2013 particularly those affecting birds of prey. We urge the government to heed this advice and we trust it will now take the lead on consigning these acts to history. The committee has clearly signalled that the game is up for wildlife criminals and it's time for a step change in wildlife crime enforcement.\"</p> <p>A Defra spokeswoman said: \"The government takes the issue of wildlife crime seriously. That is why we fund the National Wildlife Crime Unit, who work to bring these criminals to justice. We will consider the committee's recommendations carefully and will respond in December.\"</p> <p>In a statement, the Environmental Investigation Agency, said it welcomed the report and was: \"strongly supportive of the committee's call on the government to urgently address failings in current UK wildlife protection legislation. In terms of international wildlife crime, EIA is glad to see the committee urging the UK government to exert 'robust diplomatic pressure' in seeking the development and enforcement of wildlife law at the next Cites meeting in March 2013.\"</p>",

Oh well. It could be worse, the NLCS Game 3 actually happened unlike the ALCS Game 4. The St. Louis Cardinals take a 2-1 series lead, thanks to Matt Carpenter who replaced Carlos Beltran, day-to-day with a knee injury. Certainly this seems to shift the series in the Cardinals' favor but these two teams seem too evenly matched to give one an overwhelming advantage.</p> <p>Tomorrow night the Giants will bring out, well somebody, to be the starting pitcher against the Cardinals' Adam Wainwright in Game 4 of the NLCS. The game begins at 8:00pm EST tomorrow, assuming that the weather decides to cooperate this time around, and we'll be liveblogging it here in the Guardian. That will do it for me. I won't lie, may be more than a little exhausted after all that. Thanks to everyone for reading, especially those who who stuck with me and/or kept me company during that lengthy rain delay.

Wow is Motte just unconscious right now.</p> <p>Motte's next pitch. Outside. 1-2. The crowd wants a strikeout, badly. Sandoval hits a flyball to center and that will do it.

The crowd goes crazy. Scoots fouls off the next one, and he's dropped into a 0-2 hole immediately. He swings and fouls off the next pitch and stays alive. Scutaro hits a ground ball that almost squeaks through, but Carpenter is able to knock it down at first base and flip it to Jason Motte for the second out.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507f6ad1c0e361310bc6d13a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-18T02:34:57.309Z\">3.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Giants 1 - Cardinals 3, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jason Motte, coming off of throwing just nine pitches last inning, should be fresh enough to get the next three outs.

I'm going to go the lazy student route here and copy and paste from Wikipedia:</p> <blockquote> <p>Umpires are required by rule to wait at least 30 minutes to see if conditions improve; this is referred to as a <strong>rain delay</strong> and is not counted as part of the length of the game listed in the box score. In practice, umpires are encouraged to see that games are played if at all possible, and will sometimes wait as long as three hours before declaring a rainout.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, here's the thing about the postseason. In the regular season, if this game were called, the Cardinals would have won as they have the lead and it's an official game (meaning it's gone five full innings). However, in the postseason, any games called during a rain delay have to be played to completion. So, say they call this game in a few hours because it's just not going to be playable. That means they restart this game, say tomorrow, in the same situation that it is now: Runners on second and third, two out, bottom of the seventh. Obviously the personnel would be different.</p> <p>Does this make any sense? Essentially teams have to play at least nine inning games to win postseason games, no matter what the conditions.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T23:06:46.596Z\">at 12.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507f3647c0e361310bc6d110\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T22:50:47.930Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Emails</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From Chas Powell:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hi<br>Enjoying your liveblogging the NL Championship from WAY down under (Sydney)<br>Go Cards!!<br>kind rgds<br>chas powell <br>ps or should I say, keep the tornados at bay! ;)</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks.

The underrated hurler achieved some additional renown this year when he threw a <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2012/06/matt-cain-perfect-game-sandy-koufax-kerry-wood/1#.UH6pqnDvbos\">perfect game</a> on June 13th against the Houston Astros. He'll be on hand to try to prevent the Cardinals from continuing yet another improbable playoff run. This would fulfill the desires of countless baseball fans who are beginning to see the Cardinals as the <a href=\"http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/39813962/\">National League version of the New York Yankees</a> (who, in case you were wondering, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/17/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-alcs-game-3-live\">fell to the 0-3 in the American League Championship Series last night after losing to the Detroit Tigers 2-1</a>).</p> <p>Of course, there's a question about if the game is actually going to start. The weather report around game time says there's about an 80% chance of rain. There's been discussion off and on today about delaying the game or postponing it altogether. We'll see how this goes. Fingers-crossed we'll have baseball sooner rather than later. After all, if the Yankees are eliminated tonight, that means no more double-headers this year, and that would just be sad.</p> <p>We want to hear from you throughout the game. Send the Guardian your thoughts, concerns, questions and jokes and we'll post them here. Email them to <a href=\"mailto:mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com\">hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com</a> or tweet them to <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>. You still have some time before the game starts as first pitch is scheduled somewhere around 4:00pm EST, and a lot more time if the game is under a rain delay. It's the <a href=\"http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/preview?gameId=321017124\">San Francisco Giants vs. the St. Louis Cardinals</a> at Busch Stadium for an all-important NLCS Game 3. We hope, at least. We'll be back with starting lineups in a few minutes, unless we're shut down by Paul Simon's copyright lawyers.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T19:39:10.243Z\">at 8.39pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Britain's emergency services are being trained to tackle a marauding terrorist gun attack in the aftermath of the recent attacks in Toulouse and Norway, the security minister, James Brokenshire, is to disclose on Thursday.</p> <p>In a speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London, the security minister says that the home secretary has ordered a new programme of work to improve the way the emergency services respond to the changing tactics of terrorists.</p> <p>He says that the experiences in Toulouse, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/22/toulouse-shootings-mohamed-merah-killed\" title=\"Toulouse shootings: Mohamed Merah killed as siege ends\">where three children and a rabbi were murdered</a> in an shooting attack on a Jewish school in March, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/23/utoya-mass-murder-anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"Utya, the island paradise turned into hell by Anders Behring Breivik\">Oslo bombings and Ut\u00f8ya shootings</a> in which 77 people died last year demonstrated the impact that a lone individual can have if sufficiently motivated.</p> <p>\"The overall aim is to ensure that the blue light services are trained and exercised to work together as effectively as possible in response to fast-moving terrorist scenarios, so that as many lives as possible can be saved,\" he says.</p> <p>\"The programme will build upon the work done to date on the joint emergency response to specific risks, including a marauding terrorist firearms attack and incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances. Staying ahead of the threat means ensuring our emergency response is capable of dealing with the threat in whatever form it takes,\" says Brokenshire.</p> <p>The Home Office minister is also to reflect security service concerns about northern Mali joining the list of places that lack any effective government such as Somalia, Afghanistan and Yemen and where terrorism now flourishes.</p> <p>He said that since a coup earlier this year, some Tuareg groups have forged closer alliances with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, and a \"collective failure to act\" over northern Mali \"might well become manifest in attacks closer to home,\" warns Brokenshire.</p> <p>The security minister confirms that the Home Office will implement a \"no-fly list\" under which airlines will be denied authority to carry foreign nationals who pose a terrorist threat on flights to Britain.</p> <p>He is also to defend the government's plans to track email and mobile phone use in the communications data bill arguing that terrorists are using internet messaging, phone services and even video games to communicate. The security minister says that the delivery of a safe and secure Olympic Games does not mean that the threat from al-Qaida has disappeared.</p> <p>\"Those who want to do us serious harm are waiting for the moment we take our eye off the ball. The number of terrorism arrests rose from 126 in 2010/11 to 206 in 2011/12. Two hundred and eighty three persons have been convicted of a terrorism-related offence since 11 September 2000. The threat remains very real,\" says Brokenshire.</p>"
