  "<p>The NHS could save at least \u00a340m a year if more women were given help to breastfeed for longer, according to a new report.</p> <p>Research by Unicef UK for the first time calculates the cost to the health service of the UK's poor record on breastfeeding. Research has shown that breastfeeding lowers women's risk of breast cancer and protects babies against infections.</p> <p>The report looks at the potential savings to the NHS in five disease areas if women were better supported to start feeding their babies and to feed them for longer: breast cancer in mothers, and gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, ear infections and the life-threatening condition necrotising enterocolitis in babies.</p> <p>If half the women who currently do not breastfeed were to do so for up to 18 months, there would be 865 fewer cases of breast cancer, says Unicef, which would save the NHS more than \u00a321m.</p> <p>If 45% of babies were exclusively breastfed for four months and if 75% of babies in neonatal units were breastfed when they were sent home, more than 3,000 fewer babies would end up in hospital with gastroenteritis, nearly 6,000 fewer babies would be in hospital with respiratory illness, there would be 21,000 fewer visits with babies to GPs for ear infections, and 361 fewer cases of potentially fatal necrotising enterocolitis. The NHS would save more than \u00a317m.</p> <p>Other areas where there would also be savings are in cognitive ability, childhood obesity and sudden infant death syndrome, says Unicef \u2013 probably of more than \u00a36.5m \u2013 but in these and other areas, such as future adult heart disease, the financial implications are harder to assess.</p> <p>\"We know that 90% of women who stop breastfeeding in the first six weeks discontinued before they had wanted to,\" said Unicef UK's deputy executive director Anita Tiessen. \"As a society we are failing mothers and babies, and this new report shows that low breastfeeding rates in the UK are costing the NHS millions of pounds each year, as well as causing untold distress and suffering for families.</p> <p>\"We want to see breastfeeding recognised as a major public health issue from government level through to local children's centres, and appropriate investment and legislation put in place to give mothers a better experience of breastfeeding. The good news for commissioners, planners and decision makers is that our research shows that money invested to help women breastfeed for longer would provide a rapid financial return.\"</p> <p>The lead author of the study, Prof Mary Renfrew from the University of Dundee, said the report was about the impact of breastfeeding on whole populations, not individual women. Its aim is to influence planners and decision-makers within the NHS to get more support for those who would like to breastfeed.</p> <p>\"The UK is a very challenging environment for breastfeeding women,\" she said. \"For any woman to breastfeed, she has to overcome a series of barriers.\" It is hard for women who want to feed their babies when they are out or at work, she said.</p> <p>The \"ambivalence in public discourse\" over breastfeeding did not help, she said.</p> <p>\"Any infant feeding story gets quite contentious. It stirs up a dichotomy between women who want to breastfeed and women who bottle feed. We should make it easier for women to feed their babies however they want, but 90% who stop breastfeeding do so before they want to. We're not pushing against a closed door.\"</p> <p>Although 81% of mothers begin breastfeeding their baby, the dropout rate is high. Figures from 2005, which are the best currently available, show only 48% of babies were getting any breastmilk at six weeks and 35% at six months. Less than 2% are exclusively breastfed at six months, as the Department of Health recommends.</p> <p>Support for mothers from the health service is \"inconsistent and very patchy\", says Renfrew. \"A lot of current health professionals are not well-trained to give advice,\" she said. Women do not necessarily know how to breastfeed if they have never seen anyone doing it and need to be taught. And if a baby is not gaining weight, health professionals may suggest formula milk, rather than attempting to help a woman breast feed more often.</p> <p>Diane Abbott, the shadow public health minister, said government cuts are having an impact on attempts to boost breastfeeding \u2013 particularly in areas where rates are lowest. <a href=\"http://www.ssentif.com/archive/9_jun2012.shtml\" title=\"\">A study by the data organisation SSentif</a> in June showed big variations between primary care trusts. Sandwell in the West Midlands had a drop-off rate in 2010/11 of nearly 65% at 6-8 weeks, from a low breastfeeding initiation rate of 56%. In the same year, it cut spending on maternity and reproductive services by almost 20%.</p> <p>Westminster, which increased maternity spending by 157%, had an initiation rate of 89% and a drop-off rate of just under 7%.</p> <p>\"With all the pressures that hard-pressed families are facing right now, this is a cruel and two-faced attack on the health of British families, with the poorest being hit the hardest,\" said Abbott.</p> <p>An annual week promoting breast feeding nationally has been abolished and a Department of Health advisory committee on breastfeeding no longer meets, she pointed out.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has been warned he will kill off competition in the energy market after he announced that companies will be forced to give all their customers the lowest tariff available.</p> <p>To the surprise of some of his own officials and amid consternation in Whitehall, the PM told MPs the government would introduce legislation to compel companies to offer the lowest tariff.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"We have encouraged people to switch, which is one of the best ways to get energy bills down. I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers \u2013 something that Labour did not do in 13 years, even though the leader of the Labour party could have done it because he had the job.\"</p> <p>The unequivocal pledge by the PM on the forthcoming energy bill caused some surprise in the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). One source said: \"We are looking at lots of ideas about how to use the law to get the lowest tariffs. We are exploring all the options.\"</p> <p>One price comparison website warned that legislation could work against consumers' interests by killing competition. Ann Robinson of <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com/?gclid=CILMgd_diLMCFe7MtAody0IA_g\" title=\"\">uSwitch.com</a>, said: \"This has to be a mistake \u2013 the unintended consequences would be to kill competition. Consumers will be left with Hobson's choice \u2013 there will be no spur, no choice, no innovation and no reason for consumers to engage any more. The only glimmer of hope would be that smaller suppliers will be able to offer cheaper prices than the big six and therefore competition is able to continue in that arena.\"</p> <p>Cameron made his announcement in response to mounting concerns over rising household energy bills \u2013 four of the UK's big six energy firms have already announced above-inflation winter price hikes.</p> <p>After the announcement, a spokesman for the PM said: \"We've asked energy companies to take action themselves and make clear what the lowest available deals are. The point is, in practice this market is not operating for everyone. A small minority of people are actually switching deals, therefore we need to push some of this responsibility on to the energy companies.\"</p> <p>He said customers would have to wait until the bill was published, possibly in the autumn, for details of how the change would work in practice. The move did not mean energy companies would offer only one tariff, as different customers would need different rates. \"At the moment, the way the market works, people are encouraged to switch but many people don't \u2026 so lots of people are not benefiting from that market, particularly vulnerable people who are less likely to switch deals.\"</p> <p>The announcement followed a strongly-worded open letter to Cameron from consumer rights group Which?, calling for an independent review into energy bills.</p> <p>In the letter, the group's executive director Richard Lloyd wrote: \"It's time to face facts: the energy market is broken. The sector is dominated by a handful of big and powerful players who are seemingly unaffected by the normal competitive pressure of price and customer service.\"</p> <p>Reacting to Cameron's announcement, Lloyd said: \"Legislating so energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers is a big statement from the prime minister and acknowledges that competition in the energy retail market has failed. This is a big moment for consumers, but we must now see these words turned into action and see the detail from the government in the energy bill.\"</p> <p>Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the gas and electricity sector, said: \"Rebuilding trust with customers is a priority. Britain may have the cheapest gas and fourth-cheapest electricity prices in western Europe, but wholesale energy prices have been rising and now only represent half of a standard energy bill.\"</p> <p>Regulator Ofgem has already announced that it is looking into predatory pricing and tariff simplicity as part of its retail market review, while the government has encouraged consumers to shop around to make sure they are on the best available deals: the Decc has backed collective purchasing schemes such as the controversial Which? Big Switch initiative.</p> <p>On Monday SSE increased gas and electricity prices by 9%, with more price rises coming in November from other suppliers.</p> <p>British Gas has announced price increases of 6% in both gas and electricity; npower will raise the cost of gas by 8.8% and electricity by 9.1%; while Scottish Power's prices will rise in December by an average of 7%.</p> <p>The effect on household bills has spurred consumer advice groups into action. The National Right to Fuel Campaign warned that the UK was facing \"an energy bill crisis\", with cold and poorly lit homes posing \"a serious health risk to people of all ages\".</p> <p>Citizens Advice is launching the Big Energy Saving Week on 22 October to target millions of families across the UK with advice on keeping energy bills down.</p> <p>The campaign coincides with a warning from price comparison site <a href=\"http://www.energyhelpline.com/\" title=\"\">energyhelpline.com</a> that the best fixed rate energy deals \u2013 including deals from Ovo Energy and First Utility \u2013 are \"disappearing fast\".</p> <p>The government will outline plans on Thursday for a new \u00a3160m gas market infrastructure. The government will \"remove an ambiguity\" in the Gas Act to make it easier for Ofgem to launch an innovation competition that could attract \u00a3160m of extra investment. The Electricity Act will also be amended so developers will only need to undertake a three-month consultation if they want to change plans to incorporate the most energy-efficient measures.</p> <p>In the final announcement the energy secretary, Ed Davey, will say that reforms in the energy bill will unlock \u00a3110bn of new investment in the electricity market.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardianenergycomparison.co.uk/guardian_editorial\">See if you can save money on your bills with the Guardian's switching service</a></em></p>",

So I set my tripod and camera up about seven metres and focused on his eyes. Just after sunset, Larry set his flash on the lowest setting, enough to catch the eyeshine in the alligator's eyes. Like cats, an alligator has a tapetum lucidum at the back of each eye a structure that reflects light back into the photoreceptor cells to make the most of low light. The colour of eyeshine differs from species to species. In alligators, it glows red one good way to locate alligators on a dark night.

  "<p>The Kremlin is poised to take control of BP's troubled Siberian oil joint venture as the boss of Russia's state-controlled oil company Rosneft flew to London to clinch the deal.</p> <p>BP's partners in the TNK-BP joint venture \u2013 billionaires Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik \u2013 have also agreed to sell their 50% stake to Rosneft for about $28bn&#xa0;(\u00a317bn).</p> <p>At the same time BP is expected to agree a deal this week that will see the British oil giant take a 10-15% stake in Rosneft plus cash in exchange for its half of TNK-BP.</p> <p>Spokesmen for BP, Rosneft and AAR \u2013 the consortium of billionaires \u2013 declined to comment.</p> <p>If the deals go ahead Rosneft will become by far the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, producing 4.5m barrels of oil a day.</p> <p>It will also bring an end to BP's troublesome relationship with the billionaires, which forced Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, to resign as head of the venture and flee Russia during a bitter row in 2008.</p> <p>Igor Sechin, Rosneft's chief executive and a former deputy prime minister of Russia and close associate of President Putin, flew to London on Wednesday, sources said, to seal the deal with executives in advance of BP's sale auction deadline, which expires at 9am on Thursday.</p> <p>Sechin's visit comes after Russia's current deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich told reporters in Moscow that Rosneft had signed a deal to buy AAR's stake in TNK-BP.</p> <p>However, Dvorkovich cautioned that agreement will require government approval. Rosneft could pull out of the deal to buy AAR's stake while snapping up BP's.</p> <p>Analysts said the deal will be beneficial to Putin politically, as it will allow the state to benefit from BP's expertise but not allow the British company a controlling interest.</p> <p>\"This strengthens Putin's national champion,\" Iain Armstrong, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin, told Bloomberg. \"BP will stay in Russia, but perhaps in a more limited way. The Russian oil industry is in a big state of flux.\"</p> <p>Analysts speculated that Rosneft was planning to buy BP's stake in shares rather than cash because it does not have enough available capital to buy out both AAR and BP's stakes at the same time.</p> <p>It was also pointed out that a large cash windfall for BP may be seized upon by US authorities, who are still negotiating with BP over compensation for 2010's Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.</p> <p>Last year AAR rejected a $32bn offer for its half from BP and Rosneft. That came after the billionaires blocked a $7.8bn share swap and exploration deal between Rosneft and BP. Relations deteriorated further, with Fridman quitting as TNK-BP's chief executive in May 2012.</p> <p>The following month BP put its stake in the joint venture up for sale. BP, which is in the process of tidying up its global assets, has been in talks with both AAR and Rosneft about a sale.</p> <p>Sources close to AAR confirmed that the billionaires do not intend to submit a bid for BP's stake, and said BP had informed the billionaires that it expects to receive a bid from another party, which they understand to be Rosneft.</p> <p>The AAR source said the billionaires had attempted to buy a 25% stake from BP, but the suggestion was rebuffed. AAR then began talks with banks to help finance a bid for the full 50% stake. \"[But] by that time, we found that so many key banks were already committed to Rosneft and BP, and could not fund us due to an exclusivity arrangement already in place,\" the source said.</p> <p>TNK-BP hasn't paid dividends on any income this year because it has lacked a full board since December. Management recommended a $4.1bn interim dividend on 2012 profits, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The board may decide to pay the dividend in the next few weeks.</p> <p>BP's shares closed up 3.75% to 451.7p.</p>",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 President Obama and Governor Romney raced back to the campaign trail after their alpha-male showdown Tuesday.</strong> Snap polls said Obama \"won\" the debate. CNN's poll said Romney \"won\" the discussion on the economy. We'll see what the polls say next week.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Nearly as many people watched last night's debate \u2013 65.6 million at-home TV viewers \u2013 as watched the first debate, 67.2 million.</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Romney opened up a 48-46 lead among registered voters in Gallup's 7-day rolling average poll.</strong> The governor chalked up a 51-45 lead among likely voters in the poll. A Marquette University poll found Obama to be a one-point favorite in the battleground state of Wisconsin. None of the polls incorporated post-debate views.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Unemployment declined to 7.3% in the middle of October, Gallup reported.</strong> Meanwhile US home construction jumped 15% in September to hit a four-year high, according to government figures.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Much energy was expended today on fact checking</strong> Mitt Romney's claims about binders full of women, Barack Obama's claims about gangbangers and Candy Crowley's claims about what Obama said about the Benghazi attack.

One is his tendency to argue pointlessly with the moderator and his opponents over the rules of order. The other is his habit of pressing his advantage too far, seeking a kind of alpha-male moment that can seem bullying instead of strong. (His attempt at a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry was the paradigmatic example.)</p> <p>He gave in to both temptations this time around. The candidates each bickered with CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley about turns and time allotments, but Romney went at it earlier and more often \u2013 sometimes justifiably, but never successfully. He also tried too hard to pre-empt the president\u2019s increased aggression with aggression of his own, which doesn\u2019t work well in a town-hall format, where the candidates are already circling one another like sharks.

Romney, the president said, is more conservative, particularly on social issues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> But the last point I want to make is this. You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.

There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions.

The case seemed brick-strong.</p> <p>For weeks after the Benghazi attack the Obama administration disseminated a misleading version of events. Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama both said the anti-Islam video produced in California played a role in precipitating the attack. The official version of events described a protest outside the Benghazi mission that gave way to armed assault.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then we were abruptly told there was no protest. It was all made up, and it came out of the secretary of state's mouth. The<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/10/198791.htm\"> US State Department background briefing</a> in a conference call last week described a quiet night that suddenly gave way to explosions. It is self-evident that security at the mission was inadequate, despite official requests for more security support.</p> <p>Romney's argument should have been a strong one. The Obama administration had had to retract similar early inaccuracies in its account of the death of Osama bin Laden. But Romney decided to try to catch the president in what he thought was a misstatement. He jumped out of his chair and nearly charged at Obama. Here's the transcript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;Governor, if you want to reply just quickly to this, please.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Yeah, I \u2014 I certainly do. I certainly do. I \u2014 I think it\u2019s interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack, he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror. You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Is that what you\u2019re saying?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed, Governor.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;I \u2014 I \u2014 I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Get the transcript.</p> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;It \u2014 he did in fact, sir.</p> <p>So let me, let me call it an act of terrorism...</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Can you say that a little louder, Candy? (Laughter, applause.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney hung himself out to dry. Somehow he made the discussion of Libya into a farce that ended with the audience laughing at his expense. You couldn't have predicted that.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> the White House transcript of the president's remarks in the Rose Garden following the Benghazi attack <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/12/remarks-president-deaths-us-embassy-staff-libya\">is here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:13:01.596Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507eb9fa58f91d7bbadac7ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:00:26.465Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Do you count yourself among those who don't think it's possible to <strong>declare a debate winner</strong>?

There can be little doubt when watching, listening to and reading the media that they are ready to declare that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate\">Obama was back in style</a>. The issue is that many sources also seemed to suggest that, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/258396461845315584\">NBC's Chuck Todd</a>, \"Romney seemed to be ready for it.\" That would seem to suggest more of a tie than anything else.</p> <p>The question over whether this narrative becomes a solid Obama victory will likely revolve around video playback of the many confrontations between the candidates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Video playback has changed politics.

Did you watch? It was a humdinger. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>In a confrontational joint appearance, an energized President Obama and a pugnacious Governor Romney went to the mat</strong>, not quite literally, over energy policy, job creation, taxes, trade policy, women's health, Libya and more. The possibility for a knockout punch had the fighters swinging big all night long.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gone was the halting, listless Obama of the first debate</strong>. He repeatedly lashed out at Romney, starting by calling him an \"oil guy\" and ending by bringing up the 47% when Romney had no more time to speak. The governor sought to repay the president in kind, accusing him of shutting down oil drilling on federal land and personally investing in China. Were voters turned off by all the fighting? Or was the televised smackdown impossible to turn off? The debate went over time and was still going strong at the end.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The supposed debate rules were shredded</strong>. Moderator Candy Crowley asked multiple follow-up questions and performed spot-checks of fact, making for some of the richest exchanges of the night. Most prominently she corrected Romney on Libya, saying that Obama had in fact described the Benghazi attack as an act of terror, over the governor's statements to the contrary. As a result Romney was widely seen as having fumbled the point.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Crowley nobly struggled to enforce time limits</strong>, prompting several moments of babbling cross-talk as Romney, in particular, sought to finish a point or make a last rebuttal. Meanwhile the president gently clung to the mic all night, and he finished with a 3-minute-plus advantage over the governor in speaking time.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The exchanges felt personal</strong>. Romney sought to cross-examine Obama like a prosecutor. Obama accused Romney of being to the right of George W. Bush. The governor accused the president of investing his pension in China. The president accused the governor of being a pioneer of outsourcing. Romney seemed angry, Obama seemed annoyed.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Who won?

  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs\" title=\"Grand Designs\"><strong>Grand Designs</strong></a> (Channel 4) notching up its 100th episode, now is a good time to talk about Kevin. Over the show's nine series, I've fallen in love with Kevin McCloud and I've fallen out of love with him: currently the romance is just about back on. But I still don't feel as if I know him any better than when he first appeared in 1999. Is he for real or not, with his eco-warrior schtick? And more importantly, does he actually like any of the people whose designs he observes? Or the designs, for that matter? He seems to be very good at getting on with everyone, but I've never been totally convinced that once he's delivered his final wrap \u2013 usually something that includes the word \"bold\" \u2013 that he actually gives another thought to more than a handful of his guinea pigs.</p> <p>There again, his ambivalence is part of what has made this show such a long-running success. For its edge, it needs projects that have a good chance of going disastrously wrong: if every build went up on time and on budget, the series would have been cancelled long ago. It also requires participants with equal measures of self-belief and self-delusion. If I was to get a phone call from the Grand Designs production office saying Kevin was interested in following my construction project, I'd take that as a sign that it had at least a 50-50 chance of failure and was in urgent need of a rethink.</p> <p>Last night's programme was no exception, with Leigh (who bore an unfortunate resemblance to Jeremy Hunt and therefore almost certainly had most viewers keeping their fingers crossed for a catastrophe) and Graham (who wisely kept to the background) attempting to convert a disused 100ft water-tower into a four-bedroomed palace. For once, however, I wasn't entirely convinced by the jeopardy narrative. There never seemed a moment when the construction might go wrong, because Leigh had wisely employed a small army of the most competent builders in south London. So the interest centred on whether Leigh was going to run out of money before he had finished.</p> <p>Leigh was an odd case. And an odder sort of potential bankrupt. He didn't bat an eyelid when the budget was increased by \u00a3400,000 before the first foundation was dug. He had a friend who could lend him \u00a3500K in cash. He had several credit cards with credit limits that must have each exceeded \u00a325K. He had a property in Deal that luckily sold about half an hour before he was going to run out of money. And when cash was at its shortest, he bought a \u00a34K bath on impulse, without bothering to check if it fitted. If even half of this was true, then Kevin should have been suggesting Leigh see a therapist rather than encouraging him to carry on regardless.</p> <p>Most oddly of all, the construction took place over the course of this spring and summer, which I remember as being one of the wettest on record. Yet whenever Kevin visited, the sun was always shining and there was not even a hint of mud or standing water. And so the 100th Grand Design took shape. Leigh was delighted \u2013 as well he might have been, having also taken extreme liberties with squatting rights \u2013 but I was none the wiser how he planned to afford to live there. Did Kevin like it? As usual, I couldn't really tell. But everyone, including me, got what we wanted out of the hour's television. Here's looking forward to the next 100.</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00yjymx\" title=\"Getting On\"><strong>Getting On</strong></a> (BBC4), Jo Brand, Joanna Scanlan and Vicki Pepperdine's sitcom set in a geriatric ward, makes it to a ninth series, I'll be even happier. Though to call it a sitcom is to do the show a disservice, as it's got far fewer gags and many more laughs than most. As well as being darkly funny \u2013 old age and death are both subjects rich in humour for the self-aware, the middle-aged or the deeply unpleasant \u2013 Getting On is also tender and surprisingly moving, as Nurse Kim (Brand) and Sister Den (Scanlan) try to&#xa0;ignore Dr Pippa (Pepperdine) and treat the patients with an entirely believable mixture of indifference and&#xa0;respect.</p> <p>Most of all, everything about this show feels real and unforced: from what's included \u2013 such as the sheet shortages \u2013 to what's not. Few of the patients speak; fewer still have any visitors. Getting old is most definitely not for wimps, and Getting On should be prescribed viewing for everyone.</p>",
  "<p>The question that has occupied my mind in the previous few weeks is whether the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/11/national-polling-state-polling-alternative\">divide between the state and national polling</a> can keep up. State polls had suggested that Mitt Romney has rough road to 270 electoral votes, while the national polls actually had him ahead of President Obama. </p> <p>The Gallup organization did nothing to discourage this discussion when it <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx?ref=logo\">put out a poll</a> Wednesday afternoon that had the Twitterverse churning: Mitt Romney leading by 6 points among likely voters and by 2 points among registered voters. Let me state right now that this poll result is almost certainly <em>not correct</em>. That doesn't mean we should toss it aside, however. </p> <p>Not every poll published is going to be right on the average, and they shouldn't be. In a race where Romney is ahead by a point or tied with Obama, we should expect a few polls where he leads by more than 1 point and a few where Obama leads. That's <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">why we had</a> an ABC/Washington Post survey with Obama leading by 3 points and the Gallup poll with Romney ahead by 6. The polls cluster around where the true result is.</p> <p>Some might say that the Gallup poll demonstrates momentum for Romney, but the truth is that, with the exception of the immediate aftermath of the first debate, the national polls indicate that neither candidate is gaining or losing ground. Romney has gained ground in Gallup, Public Policy Polling, and YouGov surveys. Obama has picked up steam in Ipsos, IBD/TIPP, and the ABC/Washington Post poll. The GWU Battleground and Rasmussen surveys have been fairly stable. Random variation is not surprising, and we are seeing it in both directions. That indicates a race that really isn't moving.</p> <p>The same thing can be said about state polling: outliers occur. The Marquette University Law School has <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/poll-race-tied-in-wisconsin-20121017\">Obama leading Romney by only 1 point</a> in the state of Wisconsin, after the prior pre-first debate poll had Obama ahead by 11. That seems like a massive jump, but keep in mind that <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_romney_vs_obama-1871.html\">other polls</a> at the time of Marquette's previous release had the race in the mid single digits. Given how Romney gained about 4 points nationally after the first debate, we would expect Obama to lead in the low single digits in Wisconsin. The Real Clear Politics average has him ahead by 2 and the Marquette poll matches this average.</p> <p>The close race in Wisconsin does point to a potential danger sign for the president. The gap between the national and state polls doesn't seem nearly as wide as it once was. Tuesday, I outlined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/romney-routes-victory-battleground-states\">three paths</a> that could lead to Romney winning the electoral college. Today, Obama's team confirmed to the National Journal's Major Garrett that their polling <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/what-s-next-in-the-obama-romney-duel-20121017?page=2\">seems to affirm</a> most of what I wrote. </p> <p>Obama is, apparently, not counting on Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, or Virginia. The states around which they are looking to build a firewall are Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Ohio. That means that Obama's path is to win Ohio and either Iowa or Nevada. Romney can get to a 269-269 tie with Iowa and Nevada, or a win with either these two states and New Hampshire, or by winning Ohio outright.</p> <p>Notice how Obama's team didn't include Wisconsin.</p> <p>Wisconsin is a state where the polls are tight, but neither campaign seems to be making a move. It could be that it's a case where the race is tight, while support for the candidates is solid, as I pointed out Tuesday and my buddy Nate Cohn <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108725/romney-could-use-wisconsin-its-one-obamas-strongest-battleground-states\">provided greater detail</a> on Wednesday. Obama has not dipped below 49% in any Wisconsin poll since mid-August: 49% won't win him Wisconsin, but it'll get him very, very close.</p> <p>I can't take Wisconsin too seriously as a toss-up until I start seeing more candidate visits. The seeming tightening in the polls may prompt it. If it does, then Romney picks up an additional path if we allow for wins also in Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia. All he'll need is Wisconsin and <em>either</em> Iowa, <em>or</em> Nevada, <em>or</em> New Hampshire. In this scenario, Romney wouldn't have to take Ohio. </p> <p>Overall, we seem to be hitting a standstill of some type. Obama and Romney are close to even nationally. Obama holds leads in enough states to win the electoral college. Romney needs to catch up in these states, but he may consolidate a higher baseline before we start assigning true toss-ups to the candidates. We'll have to wait and see if the second debate, and then the third debate, make a difference. If they don't, it looks like we'll be on the edge of our seat right up to election day.</p>",
  "<p>Your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/14/stuart-bell\" title=\"\">obituary of Sir Stuart Bell</a> (15 October) refers to \"the Cleveland scandal, in which dozens of children were incorrectly diagnosed as having been sexually abused\". Of 121 cases of suspected sexual abuse of children diagnosed by two paediatricians in Cleveland in the spring and early summer of 1987, just 26 children, from 12 families, were judged by the court to have been wrongly diagnosed. In the remaining cases either the alleged abuser left the child's environment, or parents agreed to protection plans proposed by Cleveland social services, or the children were removed from home.<br><strong>Keith Bilton</strong><br><em>Social Work History Network</em></p> <p>\u2022 The management of child abuse nationwide was for a time put under threat until the Cleveland inquiry's conclusions were published. No doubt Stuart Bell's intervention was a factor in that inquiry being set up. He did speak from the heart but was also shooting from the hip. Other local MPs were more conciliatory. As the Savile affair is demonstrating, those with the loudest voices get heard, while children are not.<br><strong>Dr Simon Currie</strong><br><em>Otley, West Yorkshire</em></p>",
  "<p>Michael Bloomberg is setting up a Super Pac through which he intends to plough millions of dollars of his own money in an attempt to support political candidates prepared to tackle such contentious issues as gun control and same-sex marriage.</p> <p>The mayor of New York is preparing to invest up to $15m of his personal fortune backing candidates from both main parties who in his view are prepared to buck the trend towards increasing partisanship and dissension in American politics. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/nyregion/bloomberg-forming-super-pac-to-influence-2012-races.html\">According to the New York Times</a> which revealed the creation of the Super Pac, Bloomberg is particularly keen to encourage great debate in the areas of gun control, same-sex marriage and reform of public schools.</p> <p>As the mayor approaches the end of his term in January 2014, he is increasingly focusing his energies on outside political interests of which his new Super Pac is likely to form part. It will stand in stark contrast to most Super Pacs operating in this election cycle \u2013 though they are dominated by billionaires like him, they have tended to be devoted to furthering right-wing causes.</p> <p>Top of the lists of concerns of the new Super Pac appears to be gun control, a passion of Bloomberg's that he pursues through Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of 700 mayors from across the country in favour of greater measures to combat gun violence. In the wake of the second presidential debate on Tuesday night, Bloomberg was scathing about the comments of both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney during their exchange over firearms.</p> <p>He criticised Obama for failing to live up to the promise he made during the 2008 race for the White House to reintroduce a federal ban on semi-automatic assault rifles, and he equally lambasted Romney for saying he was opposed to any new laws related to the possession of weapons. \"One candidate has had four years to do something and hasn't, and the other candidate says he won't even do what he once did,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>He was particularly caustic about the attempt of both presidential candidates to relate gun violence back to inadequate education in US cities, with Romney even pointing the finger at single-parent families. \"They had all this gibberish talking about education,\" Bloomberg said. \"That education is the solution to stop the killing. My recollection is that the Aurora theater shooter was a PhD candidate. The Virginia Tech massacre was committed by a student at a first-class university.\"</p> <p>The Super Pac, the New York Times reports, will be headed by Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg who was Hillary Clinton's communications chief in the 2008 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. Candidates who will receive support from the funding body are said to include Bob Dold, a Republican member of Congress from Illinois who has pushed for gun controls and Angus King, an independent running for the US Senate in Maine.</p>",
  "<h2>UK<br></h2> <p>A laid-back former banker, described as one of the outstanding British civil servants of his generation, Ivan Rogers is the most senior EU adviser to David Cameron helping the prime minister weave his way through the minefield of negotiations.</p> <p>Rogers, 52, who cut his teeth as chef de cabinet to the European commission vice-president Leon Brittan in the mid-1990s, was summoned back to government from Barclays Capital in 2011.</p> <p>He was appointed head of the prime minister's European and Global Issues Secretariat after Sir Jon Cunliffe moved to become the UK's permanent representative to the EU.</p> <p>The former Treasury civil servant is the prime minister's formal point man with senior officials in all the main EU capitals. The Downing Street chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, who served in the Brussels cabinet of Chris Patten when he succeeded Brittan in 1999, is also a familiar face in EU circles.</p> <p>Brittan says: \"Ivan affects to be very calm and laid-back. But he is pretty serious-minded. While he was completely loyal to the European commission he was able to maintain good relations with the British government. That was not at all easy. He ran the team very effectively.\"</p> <p>One government source said: \"Ivan has more of a laid-back style than Jon Cunliffe. But he has a phenomenal intellect and powers of analysis. He is good at explaining complicated ideas succinctly. He is also not afraid to speak truth unto power. He will not shout at the prime minister but he will say: 'This is a problem, prime minister.' \"</p> <h2>Germany<br></h2> <p>When German chancellor Angela Merkel speaks to the press after European summits, Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut discreetly takes a step back. But much of what his boss had just negotiated behind closed doors and then announces to the public, Meyer-Landrut has pre-thought and pre-negotiated with his EU counterparts.</p> <p>Since his promotion in early 2011 \u2013 when the 51-year-old career diplomat became the European policy chief adviser to the chancellor \u2013 he has become the main influence on European policy in Berlin. Without his ideas and persistent negotiation skills the European fiscal pact would never have been sealed. Like Merkel, Meyer-Landrut is also convinced that the euro crisis is an opportunity to make Europe more stable \u2013 not by indulging the debt sinners, but through clear and enforceable rules for economic and financial policies.</p> <p>Meyer-Landrut was appointed as Merkel's deputy EU adviser in 2005. That he became one of her closest advisers six years later is probably because both approach political problems in a similar way.</p> <p>Merkel, like Meyer-Landrut, looks at the facts from all angles first, then calculates what is enforceable and what needs to be enforced. He is a committed European, but not a dreamer. He has also spent almost his entire career on European issues \u2013 (unusual for a German diplomat \u2013 working at the German mission to the EU and the Foreign Office. He also instinctively understands the Franco-German axis and, somehow, counts as an honorary Frenchman, having worked for former French president Valery Giscard D'Estaing, and having married a Frenchwoman.</p> <h2>France<br></h2> <p>The Elys\u00e9e Palace's \"Mr Europe\", Philippe L\u00e9glise-Costa, cut his teeth in the team of former foreign minister Hubert Vedrine from 1999-2002, as junior adviser. He was propelled from No 2 at the French mission in Brussels to the team of Europe secretary Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2007. Now 45, he has a reputation for pragmatism and diplomatic agility, and is something of an agnostic on matters of greater European federalism. Ambitious.</p> <h2>Spain<br></h2> <p>He does not give press conferences and is hardly known to the public \u2013 but among Spain's political and economic elites he is known as the \"third finance minister\". Alvaro Nadal, head of the prime minister's economics office, is Mariano Rajoy's sherpa at European summits and the G20. However, he is much more than that.</p> <p>This talented 42-year-old economist is the man who explains the economy to the prime minister. His knowledge of German and his contacts among those surrounding Angela Merkel afford him influence over Rajoy. \"The most German of Spaniards,\" FT Deutschland once called him.</p> <p>Nadal is seen as the man responsible for Rajoy's Europe policies, although he is not exactly in favour of Germany's theses. Nadal, according to various government sources, is convinced it is best to push the Germans to the limit, so that they realise they cannot let Spain fall and therefore ease up on Rajoy. \"He is not a politician. He is a man with firm liberal ideas who will take his theoretical idea to the very limit,\" says a People party insider.</p> <p>Rajoy trusts him absolutely. If you want to know what will happen with the bailout you must talk to Nadal.</p> <p>Nowadays he has shut himself away and only appears in public for key meetings: of Rajoy with Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande or Barack Obama. On such occasions Nadal is there, close to hand.</p> <h2>Italy<br></h2> <p>Mention Henry Morton Stanley and you'll see his eyes light up. Enzo Moavero has a weakness for explorers, and particularly for the Welshman-cum-American who became one of the symbols of the golden age of Equatorial exploration.</p> <p>Moavero collects maps, saying they help him understand political change, the evolution of thought and of people, and the births and deaths of empires and of states. Since taking over as minister for European affairs in the government of Mario Monti, his job has been to forge again the rusted links between Rome and Brussels. He was a natural choice for the post, since he made his career in the European institutions and knows which doors to knock on in the commission, council, and parliament.</p> <p>\"He is the most active [Italian] minister anyone can remember,\" said an MEP. \"Sometimes, he can be long-winded. But the MEPs very much appreciate him\", said one long-time collaborator.</p> <p>Born in Rome in 1954, he finished his education at the College of Europe in Bruges, where he specialised in EU law. Moavero went into the commission where, by the end of the 1980s, he was already a chef de cabinet.</p> <p>In 1993, he was asked by the-then head of the government, Giuliano Amato, to take a post in the prime minister's office, where he remained after Amato was replaced by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. It was during this period that he first met Mario Monti. When Monti was made an EU commissioner at the start of 1995, he chose Moavero to run his cabinet.</p> <p>Moavero stayed on until the start of Monti's second mandate. But in 2000, he was made director general of the commission and then, in 2006, a judge at the court of justice in Luxembourg.</p>",

  "<p>Is Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, on the brink of a negotiating triumph? That's the way his fans will tell the tale if, in the next week or so, BP receives and accepts a cash-plus-shares offer from Rosneft for its 50% stake in TNK-BP.</p> <p>The deal would be hyped as terrific for BP for several reasons. It would end the troublesome alliance at TNK-BP with the oligarchs of AAR. And BP's future in Russia would be secure since the share-based element of the sale would equate to a stake of 10% or so in Rosneft, a platform from which to strike exploration alliances with the country's state-backed oil champion.</p> <p>If that's the way the plot goes, the likely losers are the oligarchs. Separately, AAR has agreed in principle to sell its own 50% stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft for $28bn. But, crucially, the billionaires don't have a firm deal \u2013 they have merely given Rosneft something closer to an option to buy.</p> <p>If Rosneft bags BP's stake first, AAR may find that that option is left to expire. The oligarchs would then find themselves in a 50/50 partnership with Rosneft, aka the Kremlin, the very position they wished to avoid. Their problem seems to have been a lack of ready funds to bid for BP's stake and thus take 100% control of TNK-BP themselves. Raising a few tens of billions of dollars in a hurry is not easy, especially if half the possible lenders are already on the Rosneft ticket.</p> <p>Dudley will not shed tears of sympathy if the oligarchs find themselves with that strategic headache But the critical question he must answer is whether a tight embrace with Rosneft is really a trouble-free route to riches for BP.</p> <p>There are reasons to be sceptical. Rosneft shares have gone nowhere for years and BP may soon own 10% of them, as junior partner to the Kremlin, where the outcome of tomorrow's power struggles is anybody's guess. If BP shareholders wanted to own Rosneft stock, they don't need Dudley to act as their fund manager. Small strategic stakes are commonplace in the oil industry but 10% is not small.</p> <p>The counter-argument is that BP can inject greater management and drilling expertise into Rosneft, and thus help to create a revival. Well, we'll see. At best, it's a long-term bet and rests on the notion that BP simply has to be in Russia to retain a seat at big oil's top table.</p> <p>Given a clean choice, though, would BP shareholders rather bank their winnings from TNK-BP (a very successful adventure, despite the rows in recent years with the oligarchs) and wave goodbye to Russia? Many, one suspects, would. But a pure cash proposal from Rosneft does not appear to be on the table. That's a pity.</p>",
  "<p>That sharp intake of breath you can hear? It's the world running out of patience. Frustrated by years of euro-muddle, exasperated by the deepening crisis and worried at the knock-on effect on trade, growth and prosperity, leading politicians and business figures from east and west are adopting an increasingly critical tone towards Europe's handling of its debt-encrusted economy.</p> <p>To coincide with Thursday's crucial EU summit in Brussels, a range of powerful figures from business, finance and politics in China, Brazil, the US, Argentina, Japan and Mexico told the Guardian and its partner papers in the Europa project that time is running out for Europe. What the world wants now is decisive action.</p> <p>As finance minister in one of the world's most perky economies, Brazil, Guido Mantega has perhaps more right than most to criticise. Brazil is eager to avoid Europe tilting the world into a deepening recession, which may harm Brazil's commodity-fuelled boom.</p> <p>\"2012 is a lost year for Europe, that's a fact. The objective now is to keep the situation from getting worse over the next few years,\" Mantega told the Europa group of papers. He is particularly impatient with the German position, which, he says, has elevated the interest of German savers over the wellbeing of most of Europe.</p> <p>\"Germany is looking in only one direction,\" Mantega says. \"Its proposal of economic austerity seems logical vis-\u00e0-vis German voters, who don't want to foot the bill for other countries or pay for their lack of responsibility. However, the Germans will lose too if Spanish banks go bankrupt. The Spanish and Portuguese governments are making big efforts. Germany ought to be more flexible when it comes to helping those governments, instead of putting a knife to their throats.\"</p> <p>China is also preoccupied about its own economic prospects when its biggest consumer market is contracting sharply. In an interview in Beijing, a well-connected former diplomat, Cui Hongjian, said there was a measure of exasperation among the Chinese leadership at the dilatory response in Brussels to the crisis. The Chinese, he says, \"ask why Europeans argue so much but do not take action\".</p> <p>\"China must do something to stop this decline in its exports,\" he says, adding that Chinese leaders have two frustrations: that the debt crisis has almost totally overwhelmed European policy-making, and that as ever there is no single European entity that China can do business with.</p> <p>As a result, Beijing has begun stepping up bilateral relations with individual countries, particularly Germany. \"I think that if there was only one person for China to deal with, it would be more efficient.\"</p> <p>Another official, Jin Liqun, chairman of the China Investment Corporation supervisory board, said: \"The way the eurozone has handled the debt-resolution issue has been more problematic. Too much time has been wasted on debates over the terms and conditions of piecemeal bailouts. Political leaders have been digging in on their own agendas, with their objectives pulling in different directions.\"</p> <p>For the Mexican Carlos Slim, the world's richest man, cash-strapped governments need to get to grips with unaffordable welfare bills and lengthening lifespans: \"There are places where people are retiring at 60 when life expectancy, for somebody who gets to 60, is 85 or more. There are universal health-provision programmes that are inefficient and often open to tourists. The retirement age should be higher \u2026 In the service societies of today, where physical strength and physical work is less important than experience and knowledge, it is sad that a person stops work at 60 when they are in their prime.\"</p> <p>Slim, who recently increased his exposure in Europe with stakes in phone companies in the Netherlands and Austria, calls for a revolution in working hours such that people don't work eight-hour days for five days a week, but three days of 11 hours each. He says welfare should be tightly aligned with engagement in retraining programmes and that states should drum up cash through privatisations.</p> <p>\"What Europe should do is sell assets. The state does too many things. It should do two things. Sell assets, to reduce debt and deficits, but also invite the private sector \u2026 to make the investments the state no longer has any business doing \u2026 motorways, even hospitals and schools can all be financed with private money.\"</p> <p>Roberto Lavagna is a man who knows a thing or two about a crisis and how to overcome it. He was the economy minister&#xa0;who helped Argentina pull out&#xa0;of its own debt crisis a decade ago. For&#xa0;him, it makes no sense for Europe to be&#xa0;permanently flushing resources through banks, while consumers despair.</p> <p>\"I'm amazed at the enormous sums of money they give to banks, and I wonder: why not help out consumers who are in debt? Because rescheduling loans, lowering interest rates etc will eventually help consumers regain confidence, rekindle demand and get the economy going.\"</p> <p>Lavagna is unconvinced by austerity. \"The cuts destroying people's purchasing power are recessionary and don't yield results in terms of fiscal equilibrium,\" he says. \"Germany directed this current, backed moreover by an EU government in Brussels with no power or influence, and an International Monetary Fund that had always supported this blueprint. That was the blueprint which they offered Argentina and which we rejected in 2002.\"</p> <p>Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York, says that states have to balance budgets somehow. \"You could make the case that David Cameron is doing what's right, that he is addressing the issues. I don't know if he is right or wrong, but he is showing courage to stand up and do that.</p> <p>\"Can you do the same thing in Spain with an enormous unemployment rate? Can you do the same thing in Greece or Italy, where the number of people that pay taxes are relatively low? In America, everybody pays taxes. There may be a handful of people that cheat, but everybody files a tax return, and so if only a small percentage of the people don't, it is easier to enforce the law because it is manageable to go after them. If 90% of the people don't pay their taxes, where do you start?\"</p>",

As father of two daughters, he wanted them to be paid the same as other parents' sons.</p> <p>Female voters have jumped to top priority for both Obama and Romney. Until recently, Obama had enjoyed a double-digit lead among women over Romney, more than enough to compensate for Romney's lead among white males. But Romney's team claims Obama's lead among women has gone, though the Obama team disputes this.</p> <p>A Gallup seven-day poll tracking poll puts Romney ahead of Obama, 51% to 45%, among likely voters, though this was taken before Tuesday night's debate.</p> <p>Romney has also reduced Obama's lead in Wisconsin, a state that initially was not included as a swing state on the assumption it was going to Obama. A new Marquette University poll puts Obama on 49% to Romney's 48%.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, Romney has been repositioning himself in the centre and has softened his position on women's issues. His campaign put out an ad on Monday insisting that women's right to contraception and abortion would not be harmed if he was president.</p> <p>His running mate, Paul Ryan, Wednesday attempted to explain away the \"binders\" remark. \"All he simply meant was that he went out of his way to try to recruit qualified women to serve in his administration when he was governor,\" Ryan, who also said that Romney had an exceptional record in recruiting women, told CBS. \"That's really what he was saying.\"</p> <p>Romney has shifted ground during his political career, from relatively moderate while governor of Democratic-leaning Massachusetts to strongly conservative on social issues during the Republican primaries and caucuses when he said he would appoint to the supreme court judges who would overturn abortion rights.</p> <p>During the debate, Romney accused Obama of misrepresenting his position on contraception, insisting he was in favour of it being widely available.</p> <p>In the debate, Obama came across as the more sympathetic to women's rights. In exchanges on equal pay, the president said: \"This is not just a women's issue. This is a family issue. This is a middle-class issue. And that's why we've got to fight for it.\"</p> <p>The comment about \"binders full of women\" came during exchanges on equal rights. Romney said that as governor of Massachusetts he was concerned about the shortage of women in his cabinet.</p> <p>\"I said: 'Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?' And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet,\" Romney said. The remarks went a long way to calming the sense of panic that had begun to enter Democratic ranks.</p> <p>Obama, transformed from the listless, unfocused candidate who lost badly to Romney in the first presidential debate in Denver a fortnight ago, landed damaging blows on his Republican rival in telling exchanges over women's rights, the Benghazi consulate attack and tax proposals.</p>",
  "<p>A further three patients have died from a rare form of meningitis linked to contaminated steroid shots prepared by a Massachusetts pharmacy now the subject of a criminal investigation.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Wednesday that a total of 19 deaths were now known to have occurred, with 247 cases of fungal meningitis identified across 15 states.</p> <p>It comes a day after federal agents from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raided the New England Compounding Center (NECC), a pharmacy compounder in the Boston suburb of Framingham, as part of a widening investigation into the outbreak.</p> <p>The raid, which was supplemented by local police officers, came amid growing concerns that other medications mixed at the company may be contaminated.</p> <p>In a statement Tuesday, Carmen Ortiz, the US attorney for Massachusetts, confirmed that prosecutors were looking at potential criminal charges against the once obscure pharmacy.</p> <p>\"I can confirm that this office and our law enforcement partners are investigating allegations concerning the New England Compounding Center,\" she said. But Ortiz added that it was \"entirely premature\" to speculate about what might be uncovered at the centre.</p> <p>FDA investigators have already found evidence of lapse health and safety standards at the suspected source of the deadly outbreak. Experts, sent to the NECC's premises in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak, found a fungal contaminate in a sealed vial of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate.</p> <p>They also found a \"foreign material\" in another, opened container.</p> <p>The pharmacy compounder is also known to have a chequered history of violations standards, having been cited on numerous occasions by the FDA.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the FDA sent out a warning to clinics across the country to contact all patients injected with any drug from the pharmacy, to alert them of the risk of infection.</p> <p>It followed the discovery that a transplant patient who had received a heart drug mixed made by NECC had developed an infection. Until that point, all those known to have been made ill by drugs thought to have derived from the Massachusetts company have received a steroid shot for treatment in back pain.</p> <p>Although the FDA said there may be another explanation for the infection in the heart transplant patient, a blanket call for medical facilities to contact all patients potentially at risk was made.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a lawyer for NECC said Tuesday's raid by federal agents was unnecessary.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to understand the purpose of this search, since we have been clear that [NECC] would provide, and has provided, anything requested. We've been clear that warrants weren't needed,\" Paul Cirel, of the firm Collora LLP in Boston, said in a statement.</p> <p>As federal agents search the premises, US lawmaker called on the justice department to launch an investigation of whether the compounding pharmacy violated federal laws as well as state legislation.</p> <p>Pharmacy compounders traditionally mix drugs to cater for the specific needs of individual patients.</p> <p>But in the case of the NECC, thousands of doses were being prepared and shipped out across the US. More than 17,000 individual portions of the suspect steroid shot are believed to have been delivered to 76 clinics in 23 states.</p> <p>So far, 15 of those states have recorded cases of fungal meningitis linked to the Massachusetts pharmacy: Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Florida.</p> <p>Health experts believe the outbreak is far from over, with one suggesting that infections were \"nowhere near the end\".</p> <p>William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said Tuesday that he expects a \"steady increase\" in the number of fungal meningitis infections over the coming weeks.</p>",

Instead the Germans are pressing a new regime of fiscal rigour on the (then) 16 eurozone countries.</p> <h2><strong>2 May</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The bailout taboo is broken. Eurozone finance ministers agree Greece&#xa0;will get \u20ac110bn (\u00a388.84bn), paving the way for a following weekend of extraordinary drama.</p> <h2><strong>7 May</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another special summit (Van Rompuy can't believe his plot would bear fruit so quickly) instructs finance ministers to rush to Brussels to cobble together the eurozone's first bailout fund. By the small hours of the following Monday, they exceed expectations by announcing a \u20ac440bn pot which, with IMF and European commission add-ons, becomes \u20ac750bn \u2013&#xa0;in addition to the \u20ac110bn for Greece. Crisis over?</p> <h2><strong>7 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The bailout fund becomes the European financial stability facility, based in Luxembourg, and the talk turns to eurobonds or pooled eurozone debt issuance \u2013 the thickest of many red lines for Berlin.</p> <h2><strong>October</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Angela Merkel, having been defeated on bailouts, is by now focused on dictating the terms of those defeats. Revenge. At a Normandy beach resort with Nicolas Sarkozy, she bends the then French president to her will.</p> <h2><strong>26 October </strong></h2> <p>Merkel uses French acquiescence to push through tough draft rules for a permanent bailout fund and insists on losses for private creditors to Greece, sparking an almighty fight with the European Central Bank. Ireland comes under pressure to be the new Greece.</p> <h2><strong>28 November</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Despite trying to resist as its banks go belly-up, Ireland becomes bailout number two, forced to take \u20ac85bn.</p> <h2><strong>17 December</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>A pre-Christmas summit prevaricates.</p> <h2><strong>4 February 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another special summit focuses on Merkel's \"competitiveness pact\", common fiscal and economic rules for the eurozone with more intrusive powers for Brussels. This leads to \u2026</p> <h2><strong>11 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>\u2026 another summit, and the Germans introduce their notion of a eurozone fiscal pact with obligatory debt ceilings for all, constitutionally enshrined. Oh, and Portugal needs a bailout.</p> <h2><strong>24 March 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The centre-left Portuguese government collapses. A summit has leaders focus on the fine print of the new permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.</p> <h2><strong>16 May </strong></h2> <p>Portugal becomes supplicant number three and gets a \u20ac78bn bailout, despite the absence of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, detained in New York.</p> <h2><strong>24 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another summit, another bailout. Admission Greek medicine has failed. The dose is increased massively by \u20ac120bn.</p> <h2><strong>21 July </strong></h2> <p>Another summit, another emergency, heated tempers, major squabbling over the terms of the new Greek bailout. Euro meltdown in prospect. A retooling of the bailout fund begins, making it much more flexible in what it can do as a pre-emptive instrument. By this stage, Europe's leaders are pulling back from mutually assured destruction to strike last-minute compromises. There must be a better way to manage crises.</p> <h2><strong>Autumn 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The stakes gets higher, the Americans are alarmed at the failures and fecklessness of European leadership. As the questions get bigger, the proposed answers also get bigger: fiscal union, a eurozone federation. No quick fixes here, but we're looking to the future.</p> <h2><strong>9 December </strong></h2> <p>Another middle-of-the-night peak in the drama, with Merkel pushing her draconian fiscal pact as the eurozone's new rulebook and David Cameron deploying his nuke, a veto on the new treaty because Britain has been refused \"safeguards\" concerning the EU single market and the interests of the City of London. All but two, the UK and the Czech Republic, push ahead with Merkel's pact as an international treaty outside EU law. UK gets nothing; the Tory backbenches feel good. The start of a serious parting of the ways \u2013 the eurozone going one way, Britain in the other direction.</p> <h2><strong>2012</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The year opens with Spain and Italy, the eurozone's third and fourth biggest economies, as the too-big-to-fail worries.</p> <h2><strong>30 January</strong></h2> <p>Summit signs off on Merkel's fiscal pact, with the British and the Czechs outside, but the German leader looks increasingly isolated and resented.</p> <h2><strong>Spring 2012</strong> </h2> <p>Squabbling over the detail of Greece's second bailout and the losses of private creditors \u2013 Merkel's policy \u2013 which she now privately admits was wrong.</p> <h2><strong>February-March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Greece staring default in the face, austerity takes a devastating toll, and euro leaders bicker. European Central Bank under the new leadership of Mario Draghi buys some respite by delivering a \u20ac1tn of in cheap, short-term loans for EU banks.</p> <h2><strong>2 March </strong></h2> <p>Summit seeks to shift the terms of the argument, focusing on growth rather than austerity. Few are fooled, but the shift is an admission of sorts that the policies are either not working or not seen to be working.</p> <h2><strong>30 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Meeting in Copenhagen, governments agree to temporarily pool both bailout funds to create a firewall of \u20ac700bn to \u20ac800bn, depending on whose figures you believe. Lots of claims, but little substantive change.</p> <h2><strong>6 May </strong></h2> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande wins French presidential election, marking a big shift in the terms at Europe's top table. At his first EU summit on 24 May, the divisions with Germany are plain over policy to save the euro. France, Spain and Italy, all under relatively new leaderships, are now seriously challenging Merkel.</p> <h2><strong>29 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>One of the three or four really big summits to have taken place through amid the endless crisis management. A surprise defeat for Merkel. Spain is about to get a \u20ac100bn bailout and the summit agrees that the bailout fund can be used to recapitalise banks directly without going through a supplicant government. The German quid pro quo is to create a new eurozone bank supervisor, the ECB.</p> <h2><strong>September</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>At the ECB, Draghi reinforces sense of resolution by pledging unlimited buying of bonds in secondary markets to cushion Spain's and Italy's borrowing costs.</p> <h2><strong>Autumn 2012</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Promising summer melts into recalcitrance and reprisal. Brinkmanship over Greece, Rajoy in Spain looking for a bailout without usual tough terms and Merkel walking away from what she was forced to concede in June. And Cyprus and Slovenia may need bailing out this year.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney continued his march towards a centrist position on immigration during the second presidential debate, presenting a friendly face to undocumented immigrants starkly in contrast to his previous position.</p> <p>Quizzed about his support for the policy of \"self-deportation\" that he articulated during the primary season debates between Republicans, he portrayed it as a matter of choice on the part of individuals. \"People make their own choice, and if they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go to a place where they have better opportunities.\"</p> <p>But that ignored a crucial aspect of the \"self-deportation\" policy espoused not just by Romney during the primary season but by his main immigration advisers, notably the Kansas politician Kris Kobach who was the architect of several of the laws clamping down on undocumented immigrants introduced across the US. </p> <p>As Kobach <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/kris-kobach-immigration-law-mastermind\">explained to the Guardian</a> earlier this year, the idea would be to make life so uncomfortable for undocumented Latinos and jobs so hard to find that they would be forced out.</p> <p>Romney, mindful no doubt of the importance of the Hispanic vote in several crucial battleground status such as Florida and Nevada, also went further than he has before in embracing the idea of offering a pathway to citizenship to undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children. He said that service in the US military would be \"one way\" that such a pathway would be found \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57364444-503544/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">in contrast to previous statements</a> that military service would be the only way residency could be obtained.</p> <p>Barack Obama did overstep the mark in one regard, however, in that he accused Romney of exhorting Arizona's law clamping down on undocumented Hispanics as a \"model for the nation\". In fact, during the primary season Romney lauded just one specific part of the Arizona law, SB 1070, called E-Verify \u2013 a system that allows employers to check a federal database to see if people applying for work are documented or not.</p>",
  "<p>I make things up for a living. I don't get out much and I haven't allowed a newspaper in the house for thirty years, so I truly live in a world of fiction. I've got by with Louis B Mayer's definition of a documentary being a film without girls in it, while a semi documentary has one girl. Recently however, I've been obliged to confront reality head-on in the form of the film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jul/05/youve-been-trumped-review\">You've Been Trumped</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397917097\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350463403400/Local-Hero-film-poster-001.jpg\" alt=\"Local Hero film poster\" width=\"220\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local Hero film poster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It turns out that an old piece of fiction of mine, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085859/\">Local Hero</a>, bears unavoidable comparison with real life events in Aberdeenshire where the property developer Donald Trump is building his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/10/donald-trump-100m-golf-course\">\"world class\" golf resort</a>, captured in Anthony Baxter's compelling work of factual observation. I watched the film recently at the Shetland Film Festival. So here's my report from the front, the border between fiction and fact. <br><br>Page one of the writer's handbook tells you that it's characters that make a story and not the other way about. This is certainly true of the local heroines and heroes in <a href=\"http://www.youvebeentrumped.com/youvebeentrumped.com/THE_MOVIE.html\">You've Been Trumped</a>. Although they share a truly awful predicament, it's the special nature of each individual's developing reactions, revealed in measured intimate sequences, that delivers the true human dimension to the events. </p> <p>In a manifestly bleak scenario these human qualities start to show through. This isn't feel-good Hollywood stuff though; we're watching real lives and livelihoods mercilessly put to hazard by a malign concoction of egotistical bullying, corporate muscle flexing, craven averting of gaze by national politicians right to the very top and crass misreading of events by local authorities including police. </p> <p>With the rest of the audience that day I came out into the daylight dazed and shocked, with a numb feeling of individual impotence. Our usually unchallenged feeling of smug security as citizens of a mature democracy had been rocked. </p> <p>At the Q and A after the film Baxter had described how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alexsalmond\">Alex Salmond</a>, the first minister of Scotland and the local MSP on and in the spot, body swerved an open invitation to around 40 screenings of the film, both public and private, which conjures an image of him with his trademark grin as the disappearing Cheshire Cat. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397917098\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350462967438/A-still-from-the-film-Loc-003.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the film Local Hero featuring Peter Riegert and Chris Rozycki\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the film Local Hero featuring Peter Riegert and Chris Rozycki Photograph: Moviestore Collection /Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection /Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blinking in the Sunday afternoon sun in placid Lerwick we wandered and wondered what was going on; what murky doings at Balmedie beach, the rolling dunes north of Aberdeen where this drama plays out, were keeping official eyes so studiously averted, and why didn't we know more?</p> <p>Thankfully, what allowed us to transcend those initial dark feelings was something else we'd witnessed on the screen; the journey of those local heroes; the triumph of character over circumstance proven again and again. It was stirring and also humbling.</p> <p>So far so good. This factual film has delivered just as much drama and poignancy as any fictional equivalent could. And it celebrates the positive side of the human soul when pitted against the pernicious. Now we ask the question, what about the baddie?</p> <p>This is a key ingredient in any drama, and is what Shakespeare and I as pro writers would call the antagonist. That's an old Greek word for baddie, but I'm sure my old pal Will would come up with a few spicy Anglo Saxon terms to describe the actual character in the frame, our Mister Trump. </p> <p>It's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump's</a> job in the film to stir things up and mess things around. How well does Trump accomplish this? I'd say pretty well. In fact he evinces some true talent and even relish for rooting around in the sticky brown stuff and delivering it to the whirling fan. </p> <p>But there are glaring deficiencies in the drawing of this character. He seems to seriously lack certain human dimensions. There are whole sides to him that are missing. A writer who'd dreamed him up wouldn't be standing in line for any Oscar, no sir. This character breaks all the rules of drama. For a start, he has no arc. Stick with me, this is gold dust, I learned it in Hollywood. </p> <p>The arc is the progress of a character through the narrative. I usually draw it out on the page as a kind of curved line. I find it helps to lodge the idea in my mind, in case I forget. If a character doesn't have an arc, then he effectively <em>isn't</em> a character. He doesn't change and grow, he is unaffected by what happens to him on the <em>journey</em> (Hollywood term) that the story has him undertake. </p> <p>This lacking of arc is only acceptable in say a thriller where the character in question might be clearly drawn as say, a psychopath, who by definition lacks various everyday human traits like empathy and sympathy. So the general rule is, if you don't have an arc you're just hung out to dry up there on the big screen; or you're a psychopath.</p> <p>It could be that Trump was denying Baxter access to his fully rounded self, which comes across as a big mistake, because even a baddie has to be rounded (psychopath excepted, see above). </p> <p>Trump's fellow New Yorker Mel Brooks summed it up in his film The Producers, when a venal money hungry character voiced the ambition to show the world \"... the <em>real</em> Hitler, the Hitler with a <em>song</em> in his heart!\" That's a Trump we would have liked to have seen in You've Been Trumped.</p> <p>So as things stand, the Trump character as essayed in the documentary would have very limited utility in a sophisticated fictional drama. That's not to deny his usefulness elsewhere, say in a comparatively primitive or cheap drama; for instance, that old Hollywood pot boiler of eight people stranded on the high seas in a leaking lifeboat. </p> <p>We know from the start that by reel two at the latest, one of them will be energetically assisted over the side by the other seven, either to cope with a lack food on board, or an excess of sea water in the gunnels, or most likely because he's whining too much. But now we know the real reason is because he's not interesting enough to warrant survival. That's the lesson for the factual Trump if he wants to graduate to the fictional.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397917099\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350463269569/A-still-from-the-1983-fil-003.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the 1983 film Local Hero featuring Peter Riegert, Burt Lancaster, Peter Capaldi\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the 1983 film Local Hero featuring Burt Lancaster as Happer, explaining his visions to build on the beach to Peter Reigert's character Mac Photograph: Warner Brothers/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Brothers/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This takes me to my very own villain, Happer, in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/28/drama\">my film Local Hero</a>. Even 30 years ago as a young tyro writer ( I wasn't even drawing arcs in those days) I had the nous to flesh out my baddie, to endow with him with enough personal facets to keep an audience interested, and to create for them at least the facsimile of a human being with which to engage. </p> <p>For a start, there was his name; Felix Happer, Mister Happy Happy. In reality he was the man with everything but happiness. But I gave him interests and foibles; a fascination with astronomy, a love of the night sky, that, granted, became sadly a clinical obsession.</p> <p>But crucially he had some personal insight. His instincts told him that his untrammelled ego needed a measure of outside control. So he had regular sessions with an expensive abuse therapist who on demand verbally assaulted him, but who by the end of the film was happily quoting for more physical sessions at an enhanced hourly rate.</p> <p>I'm giving away too many secrets of the writing trade now. I think I'll have to close the shutters and lock the doors again and get down to cooking up an expensive weekend long screenwriting seminar all of my own on fiction versus fact. To sum up, the big screen debut of the put upon citizens of Balmedie beach presents a moving depiction of human survival and dignity amidst murky doings akin to seventies Romania. </p> <p>As for Mister Trump's contribution, I see that he's appropriated at least the cashmere coat of my own eighties' screen villain Happer, but that's not quite enough. Performance-wise, Trump is just \"Johnny One Note\" from beginning to end. </p> <p>None of the on-screen events change or move him in any way. At the end of the film he's exactly the same as he started. If he really wants to cut the mustard up there on the big screen the advice is go get yourself an arc. Problem is it usually takes a lifetime.</p>",
  "<p>Never let facts get in the way of a good debate. On Tuesday, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney clashed repeatedly on the issues during their second presidential confrontation, and occasionally the truth seemed to get lost among all the finger jabbing.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama said that the day after the attack on the consulate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/romney-obama-benghazi-defeated-debate\">he called it an \"act of terror\"</a>. Conservatives are challenging that claim.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>The transcript of the president's remarks show that he was speaking about the Benghazi attack and then noted it occurred on the anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 assault on the US. Obama then said: \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\"</p> <p>The president did not explicitly single out the Benghazi attack as an act of terror. But he did appear to be referring to it in those terms, along with 9/11. He immediately went on to speak about the deaths in Benghazi again.</p> <p>The next day, September 13, in a campaign appearance in Las Vegas, Obama used similar language. \"And we want to send a message all around the world \u2014 anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America,\" he said.</p> <p>Romney's surprise at being called out over the claim is perhaps understandable because in the days that followed, the administration stuck to the line that the assault was a response to the anti-Muslim video. The White House sent the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, to say that on television talk shows the following weekend. No mention was made of a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Finally, a week after the attack, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, called the killings a terrorist attack, but even that was not picked up by most other administration officials. In the following week the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, and other officials followed.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/gun-control-presidential-debate\">Romney defended his opposition to any new gun controls</a> by saying that there was already a ban in place for fully automatic weapons</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>That is not correct \u2013 it is possible for civilians to own such weapons if they are prepared to go through extended federal background checks including fingerprinting and pay a $200 tax. \"To say that fully automatic weapons don't exist in civilian hands is inaccurate,\" said Josh Sugarmann, head of the gun control advocacy group the Violence Policy Center.</p> <p>But neither was Barack Obama entirely open when it came to the issue of guns. Asked what had happened to his 2008 promise to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals, Obama signalled that he was prepared to see \"if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.\" However, there has been no sign that the Obama administration is genuinely prepared to expend political capital on driving such a renewal of the ban through a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, or to incur by doing so the wrath of the powerful gun lobby and the National Rifle Association.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama accused Romney of supporting a draconian Arizona immigration law that allows police officers to ask people for identification if they suspect they have entered the United States illegally.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>Romney said he had only singled out a portion of the law requiring employers to \"e-verify\" the legal status of employees as a model. A transcript of Romney's comment, made during a Republican primary debate, seems more or less support his version. During a discussion of immigration policy, he said: \"You know, I think you see a model in Arizona. They passed a law here that says \u2013 that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on e-verify.\"</p> <p>However, immigration remains a sore point with Romney for many, particularly among Hispanic voters, because the former Massachusetts governor has advocated a \"self-deportation\" approach that aims to make undocumented immigrants uncomfortable enough to leave on their own.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Romney would not have taken Detroit \"bankrupt\"; instead he \"recommended\" auto revival plan.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>The Republican candidate did not back the process that saw General Motors and Chrysler get back on its feet. He opposed using government money to bail out the carmakers, instead favouring privately financed bankruptcy restructuring. At the time, the auto industry was haemorrhaging money and US banks were in no position to loan. Under Romney's plan, it is likely both companies would have gone bust.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama's administration has created 5 million jobs over the last 30 months</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>According to the US labour department, 4.5 million jobs have been created over that stated time period. But Obama neglected to mention that in the earlier months of his tenure in the White House, America lost almost as many jobs as it has since added to the economy. So he is a net job creator, but only by a sliver.</p>",
  "<p>Seeing the posters around New York had been vaguely depressing: <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/elementary/\">Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as Watson</a> in the new CBS series Elementary. The casting seemed obnoxious, not just for Watson-as-a-lady but for Miller, an actor not wholly rehabilitated from his association with the Sadie Frost-Jude Law Primrose Hill mafia of the mid-1990s and with a permanently petulant look on his face.</p> <p>The idea of Lucy Liu, meanwhile, riled the purists as much for Americanizing as for feminizing Watson, particularly after the recent failure of another Scotland Yard to NYPD transplant, Prime Suspect. For sheer wrongness, it'd take the BBC casting Nigel Havers in a remake of Columbo to even begin to get back at the Americans.</p> <p>The set-up for the show sounded tortuous, too: Miller's Sherlock Holmes is a modern-day Londoner living in New York, fresh out of rehab and acting as a \"consultant\" to the NYPD. Watson is a former surgeon kicked out of medicine after a malpractice suit and employed as Holmes' full-time sponsor by his wealthy father. They live together in an adorable brownstone and skip around town solving crimes. </p> <p>It shouldn't work, it really shouldn't. But on the evidence of the first two shows \u2013 the third airs on Thursday night \u2013 it is one of the best things on network TV.</p> <p>This is in large part down to Miller, who plays Holmes as an Aspergic genius, jittery with post addiction, rude, resentful, with the original's clairvoyance for overlooked details. There was some horrified speculation about a romantic sub-plot between the leads, but thankfully so far there's no sign of it.</p> <p>It's a buddy show \u2013 one of the only mixed sex pairings I can think of on TV \u2013 and Liu is as good as Miller: acerbic and funny, registering her partner's eccentricities on a sliding scale from mild scepticism to outrage. (She grew up in Queens, the child of immigrant parents working multiple jobs and won a scholarship to one of the best public schools in New York, where she spent her teens looking at the other girls and worrying she didn't have enough hair on her arms. I interviewed her earlier this year; she is excellent.)</p> <p>Together, they solve the usual cop show cases, very primetime, slightly Scooby Doo, lots of scheming and mistaken identity. But the plots are as twisty as in Arthur Conan Doyle's novels, and Holmes' powers of deduction inventively tested. Miller, released from the need to be cool, romantic, or even particularly likeable, is suddenly that thing he could never pull off before: a charming lead.</p>",

Two competitors, each having enjoyed a spell in the lead, now even as they enter the final phase. In the battle of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, it is 1-1 \u2013 and the decider looms.</p> <p>Officially, that comes on Monday, with the final presidential debate in Florida. The duelling rivals prepare for that with a claim to one win each, Obama's coming at the second time of asking, making up for what had been an awful drubbing a fortnight ago. The momentum will be with him as he prepares for the last face-to-face encounter.</p> <p>And yet politics is not sport. Next week's debate is unlikely to provide the cathartic satisfactions of a fifth set or penalty shootout. For one thing, it is confined to foreign policy, which will prevent the candidates airing fully the argument on which the 6 November election surely turns: what do these two men plan to do in the next four years to turn around an economy that is still ailing?</p> <p>For another, television debates can suffer from the law of diminishing returns. The initial excitement partly comes from the novelty of seeing two men, so long kept apart and having talked only about each other, suddenly standing on the same stage and talking to each other. By Monday, the Obama and Romney Show will almost be looking familiar.</p> <p>Which is not to say the spectacle is anything but compelling. The latest clash at Hofstra University confirmed that both men are unusually skilled debaters. That should go without saying about the president, who was assured even in 2008 when he did not yet have the gravitas of four years in the White House. But it counted as news this time, given the disaster Obama inflicted on himself at the first TV debate in Denver.</p> <p>There he had been lethargic, inert and passive, his head down, his expression glum. The <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/10/cover-story-the-first-presidential-debate.html\" title=\"\">cover of the New Yorker magazine</a> depicted Romney debating with an empty lectern, as if Clint Eastwood's invisible Obama had shown up for the event. He was so listless, so absent, one former Democratic strategist revived in conversation with the Guardian a concern he had guiltily raised once before: could the president be suffering from clinical depression?</p> <p>That Obama vanished in the second debate, replaced by a man who looked like he truly wanted the job and was ready to fight for it. Whereas he had refused countless opportunities to get the better of Romney in Denver, this time he moved fast and aggressively, accusing his opponent of failing to tell the truth within the first exchanges.</p> <p>Eighteen minutes in, they were going mano a mano, standing in each other's space and squaring up to each other, all but puffing out their chests and baring their teeth. Audience members later admitted they feared the two men might come to blows. But Obama, once deemed too professorial for the gladiatorial demands of US presidential politics, stood his ground.</p> <p>Romney was no pushover, once again <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-at-hofstra-university-on-oct-16-running-transcript/2012/10/16/be8bfb9a-17dd-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_print.html\" title=\"\">putting his case crisply and clearly</a>. Casting himself as the seasoned CEO and corporate turnaround artist ready to do for America what he had done for the beleaguered 2002 Winter Olympics. \"I know what it takes to balance budgets,\" he said. \"I've done it my entire life.\"</p> <p>The result was a hard-fought and absorbing contest. The veteran conservative columnist George Will said he had seen every TV debate since the birth of the format in 1960, when Kennedy took on Nixon, and <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/17/george-will-hofstra-presidential-debate-immeasurably-the-best-in-american-history/\" title=\"\">\"this was immeasurably the best\"</a>.</p> <p>Now that the two men are even on debate wins, it's conceivable that one will deliver a knockout blow \u2013 or stumble with an irrecoverable gaffe \u2013 on Monday that will settle the matter. More likely is that the campaign will now be settled away from the cameras, by those less dramatic, less visible forces that can nevertheless determine the outcome of modern US elections.</p> <p>The first of these is what political operatives call the \"ground game\", the unglamorous, mechanical business of getting people to vote. In this, Obama holds a clear advantage, just as he did in 2008 when he stunned Hillary Clinton with the depth of his grassroots organisation. In the <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/national-politics/20121009-obama-romney-race-across-battleground-state-ohio.ece\" title=\"\">must-win state of Ohio</a> for example, without which no Republican has won the presidency, Obama has just opened his 120th field office. Romney is thought to have 36.</p> <p>Second is the under-appreciated fact that the US election is not strictly speaking just on 6 November. <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/21/14016432-early-voting-half-of-us-begins-voting-by-tomorrow?lite\" title=\"\">It began in some states on 21 September</a> and has continued ever since, thanks to early, postal and absentee voting. Americans are able to cast their ballots now in at least 40 states.</p> <p>That, too, is a source of encouragement for Obama supporters, since much of that early voting will have happened before Romney's breakthrough debate performance, thereby locking in the advantage the president held at the time. A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/14/us-usa-campaign-poll-idUSBRE8991FR20121014\" title=\"\">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> shows Obama leading Romney by 59 to 31% among the 7% of the electorate who have already voted.</p> <p>There's another fact of modern US electoral life which might help the president. The TV debates have an afterlife \u2013 on YouTube, Tumblr or Twitter \u2013 that did not exist before. \"Any misstep is played over and over again. It gets amplified, expanding on impact like a dum-dum bullet,\" said one strategist.</p> <p>The current victim is Mitt Romney, watching as his curious reference to <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/meme-of-the-day.html\" title=\"\">\"binders full of women\"</a> \u2013 referring to female applicants for jobs in his administration as Massachusetts governor \u2013 and the moment the debate moderator told him he had got his facts wrong on Libya both go viral.</p> <p>None of which, of course, helps the undecided voter to know who has the best plan for the next four years. But the number of such truly undecided voters is getting smaller by the hour. Winning this election may soon be less about persuasion than hard graft. Like many a sporting contest, this battle will not be settled by inspiration. It's perspiration that counts now.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's real success in the first presidential debate was to not emerge from the wings wearing horns and carrying a pitchfork, demanding that all the women in the audience <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/22/republican-party-wrong-side-history-female-equality\">submit immediately to transvaginal ultrasounds</a> and relieving them of 23 cents for every dollar they happened to have on them. That is what the Obama campaign \u2013 with the help of many elected Republican officials who have been championing policies that slip easily into such shocking scenarios \u2013 prepared swing voters to expect.</p> <p>When, instead, he came off as genial and direct, a proclaimed lover of both Big Bird and green energy, a lot of Americans appeared to accept this version of Romney. Polling in the immediate aftermath of the first debate showed that the Obama-Romney gender gap, which had been as high as 20 points in some states, had shrunk to almost nothing. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/15/swing-states-poll-women-voters-romney-obama/1634791/\">Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told USA Today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Women went into the debate actively disliking Romney, and they came out thinking he might understand their lives and might be able to get something done for them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-campaign-trail-debate-romney\">In Tuesday night's second presidential debate</a>, however, Mitt Romney not only failed to further his case that he understood women's lives, he made the mistake of revealing exactly what it is he might be able to do for them: commission a \"binder full\" of their resumes.</p> <p>Right. I guess this is what makes him a \"small-government conservative\". Forget creating a law that allows women to sue for equal pay (the Ledbetter Act, Obama's first major piece of legislation); just personally hire a woman every once in a while.</p> <p>There were certainly moments that I found more offensive than Romney's unintentionally hilarious creation of a new collective noun (\"a binder of women\" \u2013 like, you know, a convocation of eagles), even though it edged right up to the margins of implying actual physical harm. (Binder? I hardly knew her!) There was, for instance, his weird insistence that traditional families could prevent gun violence \u2013 as everyone knows there were no mass shooting murders until gay marriage was invented in 2003.</p> <p>And there's the fact that Romney's whole \"binder full of women\" anecdote was completely bogus: he commissioned no such binder; it was provided to him by a bipartisan coalition of women's groups, which had created it prior to his election. Further, the number of women working in Massachusetts government actually <em>went down</em> during his tenure. I guess it wasn't really that full a binder.</p> <p>The biggest problem with making voters believe that Romney (or the Republican party in general) is conducting a \"war on women\" has been, up until now, that Romney and his colleagues just don't seem very scary. The children's show aficionado and advocate of cautious capitalism of the first debate is a case in point, but even the more combative presence in New York on Tuesday evening doesn't seem like someone that would do women any harm (though he would totally hit Obama if he could).</p> <p>But the war on women is something more pernicious even than a \"cold war\". Not only do we rarely see a true battle (exception provided by Todd Akin), but one of the major combatants doesn't really believe their actions count as aggressions. In a contest over civil rights, after all, the oppressor doesn't feel any pain until <em>they</em> start to lose. </p> <p>Romney just got a paper cut. We'll see if he can make the bleeding stop by election day.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally referred to a \"convocation of owls\"; that collective noun correctly applies to eagles. The amendment was made at 3.30pm ET on 17 October</em></p>",
  "<p>Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has warned the worst could still be to come for the banking sector as he called for an end to the get-rich-quick culture of the City.</p> <p>The favourite to take over from Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, Tucker told a City audience: \"There is a tangible probability \u2013 not a high probability \u2013 that the worst may still be ahead\" for banks, which was why they needed to hold more capital.</p> <p>Calling for changes to the way bonuses are paid to bankers, he stressed there was not a \"single policy initiative\" to make the system safer after the 2008 taxpayer bailout and warned that policymakers would face a backlash when they took measures to prevent exuberance in the future.</p> <p>In his first speech since formally submitting his application for the post of governor Tucker said that Threadneedle Street wanted to make it easier for new banks to be established in orderto increase competition. He added: \"I would say that the Bank believes what it always believed: that sound and honest finance is not only essential for the economy, it will be good for the City too.\"</p> <p>He said the Financial Policy Committee, on which he sits, was concerned a \"tidal wave\" could be coming. \"We may all be grateful that there is a few billion more of capital here and there in the banking industry, keeping banks in the private sector rather than the dead hand of state ownership.\"</p> <p>Tucker outlined a number of reforms which were needed, and described the breakup of the Financial Services Authority into what is known as \"twin peaks\" \u2013 with the Bank getting banking supervision and the new Financial Conduct Authority looking after consumers \u2013 as \"25 years too late\".</p> <p>Tucker said bankers needed to be paid in subordinated debt and put more focus on customer service rather than sales and on the medium-term success of the firm.</p> <p>\"Putting it bluntly that would make it less easy to get rich quick irrespective of the quality of the business transacted or the compliance culture in their part of the firm,\" Tucker said, indicating this would require changes to the codes on remuneration.</p> <p>He said branch managers needed to no longer be seen as \"an exercise in sales and marketing\" but instead make credit judgments.</p> <p>While changes are under way, Tucker said that all risk could not be avoided: \"We need to find broadly the right balance between, on one hand, safety and, on the other hand, the contribution that sound and honest finance can make to economic prosperity.</p> <p>\"We may not be able to abolish the occasional waves of optimism that grip humanity and the tendency to excess when they set off. But we can and must dampen their effects on the financial system and economy. This must include changing the incentives that bankers face.\"</p> <p>He was addressing a City audience at the annual British Bankers' Association at which the FSA's managing director, Andrew Bailey, said he had made it clear to banks that the need to hold more capital should not be used as a reason to restrict lending to households and businesses.</p> <p>He said the government's funding for lending scheme, intended to cut the cost of borrowing, \"should improve credit creation in the economy through lowering rates on new lending \u2013 but to some degree it may also enable banks to improve their net interest margins and thus build more capital\".</p> <p>Bailey also praised banks for the forbearance they are offering on loans by restructuring the debts of customers in trouble. \"I think banks deserve a thank you for the way in which they have sought to use forbearance\", he said, because their action had led to \"fewer jobs .. lost and fewer homes repossessed.\"</p> <p>Speaking at the same conference City minister Greg Clarke compared rogue bankers who break the law by manipulating financial markets to the rioters who rampaged through UK cities last year - and said they should face similarly tough sentences, including jail.</p> <p>Referring to the heavy sentences handed down to many rioters, Treasury minister Greg Clark said \"a similar premium\" should apply to financial crimes that seriously damage public trust.</p> <p>\"Most people expect things to work in a certain way. If someone breaks the law, they should be punished. When the crime is serious, they should be locked up. This should be as true for criminals who steal through financial manipulation as it is for those who break-and-enter.</p> <p>\"Indeed, just as sentences handed down to those who were convicted in last year's riots reflected their contribution to the breakdown in the confidence and security enjoyed by ordinary working people, so must a similar premium apply to those crimes which destroy trust that so many people depend on.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Martin Wheatley, a senior regulator at the Financial Services Authority and boss of the soon-to-be-created Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal \"has resulted in a huge clean-up bill akin to an oil spill in terms of ongoing damage\".</p>",
  "<p>One of the world's most experienced financial regulators has warned the government that its planned legislation to protect the public from another banking crash is flawed.</p> <p>Paul Volcker, a former head of the US central bank and an adviser to president Obama, said plans to ringfence the casino investment banking arms of major banks from their high street operations would encourage bosses to seek loopholes to take bigger risks.</p> <p>In a submission to the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/bankingstandards\" title=\"\">Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards</a>, Volcker said a ringfence was complex and difficult to regulate compared with simply splitting investment banking operations into a separate firm.</p> <p>\"When you adopt a ringfence, pressures from inside the organisation tends to weaken the restrictions,\" Volker said.</p> <p>\"I'm not saying it will be totally ineffective, but the Vickers report says it is going to have a ringfence with exceptions, and once you go down that road of having exceptions the [banking] organisation is going to push for more exceptions and widen the limits,\" he said.</p> <p>The warning is likely to be taken seriously by the commission, which is made up of senior MPs and Lords, including the Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie and former chancellor Lord Lawson.</p> <p>Tyrie has voiced concerns about the government's proposals to regulate the banking sector and about the powers of the new banking supervisor, which will be an agency of the Bank of England.</p> <p>The draft bank reform bill put forward by the Treasury is largely based on a report by the Independent Banking Commission, headed by Sir John Vickers. The commission rejected calls to split the banks and hive off their risky operations into separate businesses after furious lobbying by the industry.</p> <p>Volcker, who is 85 and came to prominence in the Reagan administration as Federal Reserve chairman, is credited with coining the so-called \"Volcker rule\", which seeks to prevent commercial banks from owning hedge fund-type operations and using their own money to take high risk bets on the markets.</p> <p>These hedge-fund type services, known as proprietary trading, have generated huge profits and bonuses for executives in boom times, but were in large part responsible for the financial crash of 2008.</p> <p>Much of Volcker's design for banking regulation has been included in the Dodd Frank Act, which the US Congress passed two years ago and which takes effect next year.</p> <p>He said the UK had adopted an outmoded view of banking services that categorised services designed to support business customers with the casino activities that brought about the crash.</p> <p>He also told the commission that the UK had chosen to ringfence the wrong parts of the bank.</p> <p>\"While I would leave lots of services in the core of the bank, I would separate proprietary trading into a separate firm, which can go bust if it gets the risk management wrong,\" he said.</p> <p>Tyrie has said his commission will examine the bill for any divergences from the Vickers report, and will consider how its recommendations will shape the incentives and behaviour of banks and bankers.</p> <p>Tyrie is already concerned about the drafting of the bill.</p> <p>He said last week: \"The draft bill appears to leave a lot of detail to be determined in secondary legislation.</p> <p>\"We will press vigorously to find out what that is going to contain. Only by doing so will anyone \u2013 the industry, bank customers, Parliament and the public \u2013 be able to find out what this legislation really means for them,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Is the chief Legal Ombudsman for England and Wales right to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/oct/15/legal-ombudsman-complaints-lawyer\" title=\"\">suggest</a> that lawyers are scary?</p> <p>I declare an interest here. I am one. And I am taking Adam Sampson's remarks personally. Like many other legal practitioners I subscribe to the view that reason and negotiation are more productive than intimidation any day of the week, whether you are litigating or trying to close a deal.</p> <p>There's support for Sampson's comments, however, at least as far as client relations are concerned, in <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/aboutus/Research_and_survey_findings.html\" title=\"\">YouGov research</a> commissioned by the Legal Ombudsman and the Legal Services consumer panel.</p> <p>An online survey of 1,010 \"premature complainants\" - consisting of people who didn't complain to their lawyers before going to the <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Legal Ombudsman</a> - found a distinct reluctance on the part of clients to take their legal advisors to task, particularly when a case is ongoing.</p> <p>People find it confusing and often intimidating to air grievances with their lawyers, the research concluded: \"Inherent within the complaints system is a lack of confidence that the complaints process with a legal services provider will work objectively and a feeling that to complain will disadvantage the consumer.\"</p> <p>Lawyers were not the only recipient of complaints from the survey's participants. The YouGov research found that the Legal Ombudsman, as Sampson accepted in his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/oct/15/legal-ombudsman-complaints-lawyer\" title=\"\">post on Monday</a>, could do better. The problem is that consumers don't understand where the scheme fits in to the complaints process or what it can achieve.</p> <p>A fifth of those surveyed thought, mistakenly, that the Legal Ombudsman could take over a complaint against a law firm, before it had been concluded.</p> <p>To another 10% of participants the Legal Ombudsman system seemed too complicated. A third of premature complainants didn't go back to the Legal Ombudsman when complaints weren't resolved to their satisfaction and the YouGov research put this down to \"a sense of fatigue and disenchantment\". Aggrieved customers get tired of feeling that they are being passed between systems and 37% of those surveyed were so fed up they just let their complaints go.</p> <p>The free complaints resolution service the Legal Ombudsman provides to members of the public is independent and impartial. While it is not a consumer champion - something else people find difficult to understand - it can investigate complaints and award compensation against legal service providers such as solicitors, barristers, licensed conveyancers and trade mark attorneys. The ombudsman can also instruct lawyers to do more work to put things right, to reduce fees, and to apologise.</p> <p>The YouGov research said the Legal Ombudsman needs to be clearer in its communications with consumers: \"53 per cent of people felt that the guidance from the Legal Ombudsman's website was to contact the Legal Ombudsman itself. This shows that there is an issue here relating to clarity of advice and the large potential for people to misinterpret the advice given.\"</p> <p>The ombudsman has made a start by updating its <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/aboutus/publications.html\" title=\"\">guide to consumers about how to make complaints</a>. A complaint can be lodged with the Legal Ombudsman if a <a href=\"http://www.legalservicesboard.org.uk/about_us/office_for_legal_complaints/index.htm ombudsman scheme\" title=\"\">legal service provider</a> fails to respond within eight weeks, or if the client isn't satisfied with the final response, provided that the complaint is brought within one year of the problem arising - or coming to the attention of the complainant - and within six months of the law firm's final response to it.</p> <p>The vast majority of funding for the scheme comes from an annual levy charged by the regulatory bodies of law professionals, although a case fee of \u00a3400 is charged where a service provider has more than two complaints against it in a year.</p> <p>The Legal Ombudsman service may be hiding its light under a bushel of a website. It tells me that it awarded the maximum compensation of \u00a330,000 on three occasions in the last financial year - in one case the lawyer didn't tell the client that a converted attic space was not included in a lease and in another the lawyer failed to advise a client that he was liable to pay the other party's costs in a property dispute. The Legal Ombudsman's office also tells me that it has taken 13 lawyers to <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/downloads/documents/press_releases/Press-Release-Lawyer-held-to-account-141111.pdf.\" title=\"\">court for ignoring its decisions or failing to cooperate</a>. That information is not readily available on its website. It should be.</p> <p>The Legal Ombudsman began publishing <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/ombudsman-decision-data/\" title=\"\">its decisions online</a> in September and plans to update this information on a quarterly basis. The provision of that data may go some way to increasing consumer understanding about the way the scheme operates.</p>",
  "<p>The government has appointed a barrister to oversee four separate investigations into Jimmy Savile's behaviour at the hospitals where he worked as a volunteer, while continuing to resist calls for a full independent inquiry into the scandal.</p> <p>Kate Lampard, the former deputy chair of the Financial Ombudsman Service, will offer \"independent oversight\" of the investigations currently ongoing into alleged abuse by Savile at Stoke Mandeville hospital, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor secure psychiatric hospital, the prime minister's spokesman said, as well as an internal investigation at the Department of Health into its own conduct during the decades when it had direct responsibility for the running of Broadmoor.</p> <p>But despite calls from Labour and some Conservative backbenchers, ministers have stopped short of ordering an independent inquiry into the entire Savile affair, including his behaviour at the BBC.</p> <p>\"Nothing has been ruled out. But it is right in the first instance that each organisation that has responsibilities fully investigates these allegations and revelations,\" a spokeswoman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Two additional formal inquiries are currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/16/jimmy-savile-scandal-bbc-inquiry-heads\" title=\"\">ongoing at the BBC</a>. The first, into the circumstances that led to the shelving of a Newsnight report into allegations against Savile, will be led by the former head of Sky News, Nick Pollard. Dame Janet Smith, the former high court judge who conducted the inquiry into the serial killer Harold Shipman, will look at the BBC's handling of material that might have been of interest to the police during the years that Savile worked at the corporation. The BBC will also look at wider allegations that a culture of harassment of women and girls was tolerated at the time.</p> <p>A police operation, led by the Metropolitan police but involving at least 14 other forces around the country, is also ongoing.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has led the calls for a single over-arching inquiry, saying: \"In order to do right by the victims I don't think the BBC can lead their own inquiry. We need a broad look at all the public institutions involved - the BBC, parts of the NHS and Broadmoor. This has got to be independent.\"</p> <p>But the culture secretary, Maria Miller, dismissed the calls in the House of Commons, saying she was confident that the BBC chiefs were taking the claims \"very seriously\".</p> <p>\"In terms of a wider inquiry, we have a police investigation ongoing at the moment,\" she said. \"Everybody would agree that it is really important that those individuals who have been victims know that that investigation can go on unfettered and that should be our priority at this stage.\"</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said last week it had identified around 60 possible victims of the late DJ, over a period of abuse spanning up to six decades.</p> <p>The Department of Health is looking into its own conduct in the four decades to 2001, when Broadmoor was transferred from direct government control to West London Mental Health Trust. In 1988, the then health secretary Ken Clarke appointed Savile to chair a task force overseeing the hospital after its management board was dismissed, the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/12/jimmy-savile-government-civil-claims\" title=\"\">revealed</a>.

Resting on a pallet next to a generator perched on an old office chair, it belonged to one of the caravans huddled along the edge of Oak Lane, the road that used to lead to Dale Farm.</p> <p>It was here that one of the biggest \u2013 and most disruptive \u2013 evictions in Britain in recent years played out among chaotic scenes a year ago on Friday. But 12 months on it is clear that the eviction of the unauthorised Travellers' site near Basildon in Essex is far from finished.</p> <p>About 80 families were removed from the site after a decade-long legal battle on 19 October last year, but many have not gone far. Approximately 20 caravans are parked on the road with no running water or mains electricity, and around the same number have squeezed on to the pitches on the legal Travellers' site next door.</p> <p>Only about 10 families have found new pitches elsewhere in the country, according to former residents. \"They've ruined everyone's lives and for what,\" said Noreen Sheridan, speaking inside her own illegally parked caravan. \"A few metres? It cost millions and they have just created a bomb site. We haven't gone anywhere.\"</p> <p>The site that used to house them is now an unlovely wasteland punctuated by carved-up hardstanding and the detritus of the eviction: a sofa with its innards torn out, a smashed ping pong table, an array of broken light-fittings.</p> <p>A small amount of asbestos has been found and dealt with, according to the council, and the Environment Agency is due to report at the end of the month on whether the eviction uncovered pollutants. Tony Ball, the leader of Basildon council, acknowledges that it is far from the greenfield site that was promised by the council and specified by the court order to remove the caravans.</p> <p>But he defended the eviction \u2013 which cost more than \u00a37m, including policing costs \u2013 and promised the land would be returned to a greenfield site. \"We would have preferred not to have to do [the eviction] but it was the right thing to do, as the council has a duty to uphold the law\" he said. \"There is no doubt the site is not how I would like it, it is a bit of a mess, but I am determined that in the future it will become what people recognise as a green field site.\"</p> <p>The Dale Farm site belongs to the Travellers who lived there, but as it was greenbelt land they had no right to live there. Now they may lose the land altogether: Ball insists that once the exact costs have been determined, the council will be pushing to recover the money from the evicted Travellers. If they are unable to pay, the land will be seized.</p> <p>He also insisted the council would continue to push to make sure former residents at the side of the road ended their \"illegal\" encampment and said the council believed many of the unauthorised caravans belonged to new residents who had not lived at Dale Farm. Eviction orders on all roadside caravans have been served \u2013 and ignored. The council is now considering its next move.</p> <p>Morale among former residents is low and many refuse to talk about the day of the eviction, when large teams of bailiffs, backed up by police officers, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/19/dale-farm-eviction-clashes\" title=\"\">broke into the barricaded site at dawn</a> as cars and tyres were set on fire, while masked activists threw missiles at police and locked themselves to gates.</p> <p>\"Dale Farm wasn't much to look at but it was beautiful at heart,\" said 24-year-old Mary Sheridan, whose son is six months old. \"Tony Ball said the eviction would be peaceful but it was like we were in hell. They completely and utterly ruined everyone's lives. My son's life was ruined before it began.\"</p> <p>Others on the site said prejudice against Travellers has got worse since the eviction. One woman, who did not want to be named, described trying to return a faulty buggy to a local shop to be told that refunds did not have to be given to anyone who lived on Oak Lane. She would not let her two-year-old daughter out of the caravan because she feared for her health, she added. \"I'm going through that much disinfectant trying to keep things clean, but the children around here are always getting sick since the eviction. It's horrible.\"</p> <p>Some members of the settled community see things differently. One resident, who did not want to be named, was happy the eviction had gone ahead. \"Of course I'm pleased, everybody around here is, it has gone on for too long,\" she said. \"It is horrible living here and if I could sell and leave tomorrow I would. It must be even worse for them now so I don't know why they don't travel.\"</p> <p>According to Candy Sheridan, a Traveller campaigner and long-term supporter of Dale Farm, it is increasingly difficult for Travellers to travel. At the Conservative conference the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, promised new powers to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/aug/29/traveller-gypsy-unauthorised-sites\" title=\"\">eject Travellers from private sites</a> before they had settled, she said, adding that councils had become emboldened by Basildon's actions. \"Basildon's shameful use of planning law has given the wrong message, essentially that Gypsies and Travellers will not be tolerated here in the same way Roma are not in Europe,\" she said.</p> <p>A planning application is now under way for a small 12-pitch site three miles from Dale Farm at Gardiner's Road, and a decision is expected in November. \"We are saying to Basildon, OK you upheld planning law but what now?\" she said. \"They have to acknowledge the Traveller community in Basildon, not just hope they can erase them with another winter.\"</p>",

The TUC's ruling body has agreed to contact unions over the prospect of a strike that would range across the public and private sectors, from school teachers and nurses to fuel tanker drivers and airline cabin crew.</p> <p>A TUC spokesperson said: \"We will now consult with member unions on the practicalities of a general strike. Whether members support such action will be the first step in that.\" The move comes one month after the TUC's annual conference backed a motion calling for consideration of a general strike, in a vote that was backed by Britian's three largest unions: Unite, Unison and the GMB. But some unions opposed the motion and the TUC's outgoing general secretary, Brendan Barber, has said he does not see \"any prospect\" of a mass walkout.</p> <p>Saturday's A Future That Works march and rally will be attended by tens of thousands of people in central London, with sister events in Belfast and Glasgow also calling for an alternative to government austerity measures.</p> <p>A group of young unemployed people will lead off the march, which will be attended by faith groups, charities and disability groups, among other organisations, as well as trade union members.</p> <p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services \u2013 Britian's largest civil service union \u2013 will use his speech at a post-march rally in Hyde Park to call for a general strike to be organised as soon as possible. Serwotka, one of the most vocal advocates of prolonged strike action against cuts, argues that public and private sector unions should mount coordinated action against austerity measures.</p> <p>Aslef, the train drivers' union, said that the likelihood of a successful general strike will be limited by legislation governing strike ballots, which imposes considerable practical constraints on large walkouts by requiring that each ballot is backed by significant amounts of detailed data. Over the past three years, strikes by Network Rail employees, British Airways cabin crew and London bus workers have been halted by failure to adhere to those guidelines. \"The practicalities of a general strike are very difficult to deliver,\" said Mick Whelan, Aslef's general secretary. However, Whelan added that spontaneous walkouts could breakout among some work forces if a general strike proves impossible. \"If we cannot organise a general strike legally, then people will be looking at how to do it in other ways.\" A leading industrial relations barrister, John Hendy QC, argues that a general strike against government policies \u2013 as has happened in Spain and Greece \u2013 can take place under the European Convention of Human Rights, which is enshrined by the UK Human Rights Act. Steve Turner, Unite's director of executive policy, said: \"This will be a political strike. There will not be any ballots and it is our view that political strikes are not unlawful.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, tension over public sector pay was raised on Wednesday when Unite, Unison and GMB formally submitted a claim for a \"substantial increase\" in pay for 1.6 million local government workers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Public sector pay has replaced pension reform as the primary issue for many unions. A three-year pay freeze is being followed by two years of further restraint after the chancellor, George Osborne, capped pay increases in 2013-14 and 2014-15 at 1%, effectively tying the hands of local government employers and the NHS pay review body.</p>",
  "<p>Ken Clarke, the minister without port\u00adfolio, has written to Lord Leveson saying he is not opposed to a form of statutory \u00adregulation for the press, pointing out that a similar statutory underpinning of the judiciary has not undermined its independence.</p> <p>Clarke also dismissed those who claim that regulation would amount to Armageddon and backed a fully independent body capable of imposing fines.<br>His remarks follow sharp warnings by other ministers, including Francis&#xa0;Maude and Michael Gove, opposing any intervention to inhibit press freedom in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. A recent poll showed overwhelming support for greater controls over the media and widespread \u00addistrust over the closeness of politicians to those in the media. </p> <p>Clarke sent his four-page letter as \u00adjustice secretary in July and it was published on Wednesday. It is the fullest set of \u00adremedies from a senior government \u00administer since&#xa0;the phone-hacking scandal. He stressed he was writing in a personal \u00adcapacity, but his letter shows that \u00adgovernment is not uniformly opposed to reform.</p> <p>Clarke writes: \"I believe we do need a new regulator \u2013 one with substantially more power and independence than the PCC, which failed in its previous incarnation, and no longer commands the confidence of the public. </p> <p>\"I also share what appears to be the consensus view that a new body should be independent both of the industry and of political influence.\" </p> <p>In a sharp break with what some cabinet ministers have been saying, he states: \"I am not convinced, though, that a statutory underpinning of some kind would amount to state control of the press. You have pointed out the statutory duty of the lord chancellor to uphold the independence of the judiciary.\" </p> <p>\"I entirely agree with Lord Hunt [chairman of the Press Complaints Commission] that participation of all the big players is highly desirable if the new system is to have meaning. I am more sceptical than Lord Hunt though in thinking that publications would wear membership as a badge of honour; I can distinctly see the opposite being true. </p> <p>\"At the other extreme, I am troubled at the notion of membership of the body being a hard requirement of the right to publish. I cannot see how we could reasonably have a system that forced bloggers and suchlike to sign up, nor licensed gadflies like Private Eye facing legal action and possible closure because they have not complied with a set of pre-agreed requirements.\" </p> <p>Discussing what forms of sanctions could be applied, he said: \"A different kind of answer may lie with the advertising agencies and media buyers. If they could be encouraged to support only those publications who were members of the body and who had signed up to the code, the attractions of joining would be readily apparent. This perhaps has parallels with the Advertising Standards Authority, albeit in the other direction, with banned adverts being pulled by broadcasters and owners.\"<br> He also calls for the successor body to the PCC to be able to impose remedies, rather than negotiate them. \"In addition, fines should be available for serious or systemic breaches of the editors' code [of practice]. I would also go further than Lord Hunt in saying that the prominence and content of apologies should sometimes be set unilaterally by the regulator, generally pursuing the principle that it should attract 'similar prominence' as the offending article.\" </p> <p>He adds that he is attracted to the idea of contracts, with the possibility (hopefully never used) of civil litigation if the contracts are broken.\" </p> <p>The proposals for contract law have been put forward by Hunt but need not conflict with some form of statutory underpinning to ensure all newspapers participate. </p> <p>Clarke's support for independent regulation does on the surface conflict with Hunt's idea of \"independently led self regulation\". </p> <p>Polling conducted by YouGov and handed to Downing Street by the Hacked Off campaign shows more than three-quarters of the public prefer an independent body, established by law, to regulate the press rather than a body established by newspapers.</p> <p>Conservative voters are 80% in favour of an independent body and 12% are in favour of self-regulation. Labour voters are 81% in favour of an independent body with 8% in favour of self-regulation. Lib Dem supporters are 86% in favour of an independent body versus 10% in favour of self-regulation.</p> <p>More than two thirds of the public agree with the statement that politicians are too close to owners and editors and can't be trusted to protect people from the \"unethical behaviour\" of journalists.</p> <p>More than three quarters of the public polled agreed that after the phone-hacking scandal it is no longer acceptable for newspaper owners and editors to control the complaints system.</p>",
  "<p>Health-and-safety issues scuppered the planned promenade element of this two-hour version of the Jacobean thriller of disputed authorship. But it would take more than moving the audience around to bring urgency and real terror to Suba Das's revival, which features a miscast <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/17/jaime-winstone-actor\" title=\"\">Jaime Winstone</a> as the virtuous woman who refuses to yield her virginity to a lustful duke's son.</p> <p>It's a tricky play, and one which has tripped up far more experienced directors than Das. However, in Tom Mothersdale, as the avenging Vindice, hell-bent on delivering rough justice to the duke who raped and murdered his fiancee, he has an actor who should be more than capable of delivering both the sardonic humour and gaudy horror of the play.</p> <p>Despite its billing as a Halloween shocker, the whole thing is oddly muted, with its Grade II-listed music hall venue \u2013 complete with gilt mirrors, rusty walls and iron balustrades \u2013 doing an awful lot of the work. As with Das's 2011 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/dec/08/winters-tale-review\" title=\"\">The Winter's Tale</a>, played outside in the depths of winter, there is plenty of atmosphere, but inattention to the text and storytelling. It's not even entirely clear when it's set: there are modern touches, so we view the rape and murder of Gloriana on screens, but it has a 1930s feel, too. The result isn't timeless, just vague.</p> <p>There are moments when the show sparks to life, and it gains momentum in the second half, with the murdered duke's coffin placed downstage: during the climactic masque, it looks as if the participants are dancing on his grave. It's a piece in which obsession and murder spiral so wildly out of control that it makes that other revenger's tragedy, Hamlet, look like a pleasant night out.

  "<p>Twenty million lives have been saved from tuberculosis (TB) over the past 17 years, but the battle against one of the deadliest scourges of mankind is now on a knife's edge, as drug-resistant strains spread, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p> <p>Its annual report shows that a race is on between the spread of deadlier TB strains and the development of new technologies that have the potential to stamp out the disease. Dr Mario Raviglione, director of the WHO Stop TB Department, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The momentum to break this disease is in real danger. We are now at a crossroads between TB elimination within our lifetime, and millions more TB deaths.</p> </blockquote> <p>Huge efforts have been made to defeat TB, which was once thought to have been eradicated in more affluent nations but is now a reinvigorated threat to the whole world. Some 51 million people have been treated since 1995 according to WHO recommendations, which involve six months of antibiotics taken under observation, because of the importance of finishing the course. </p> <p>\"Without that treatment, 20 million people would have died,\" Raviglione added. \"This milestone reflects the commitment of governments to transform the fight against TB.\"</p> <p>The numbers of people falling ill have continued to drop, by 2.2% last year, and the mortality rate has gone down by 41% since 1995. But there were still 8.7m new cases last year and an estimated 1.4m deaths.</p> <p>But the real fear is that the steady progress against TB will not be enough to defeat the resistant strains that have emerged and are now spreading. The report talks of a \"persistently slow response\" to multi-drug resistant TB. Only one in five cases that are thought to exist are being diagnosed worldwide, and unless they are detected and treated, drug-resistant virus will be passed on.<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/30/tb-cases-increasingly-resistant-drugs\"> A paper published by the Lancet medical journal in August </a>found an alarming rate of increase in drug resistant cases.</p> <p>On the positive side, the WHO report says a diagnostic test that can be used in the field and new drugs are on the way, the first of which is expected to become available next year. There are a number of new potential vaccines. The executive summary says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New or repurposed TB drugs and novel TB regimens to treat drug-sensitive or drug-resistant TB are advancing in clinical trials and regulatory review. Eleven vaccines to prevent TB are moving through development stages.</p> </blockquote> <p>But there is not enough money to pay for the new tools that are needed. The report talks of \"critical funding gaps for research and development\". $2bn a year is needed, but in 2010, the funding gap was $1.4bn.</p> <p>A strongly worded editorial in the Lancet emphasises the danger:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the approach to tuberculosis control is not returning the kind of impact the world should expect to see. Insufficient attention and funding over several decades have allowed the global epidemic to remain a deep scar on the reputation of global health. </p> <p>And looking ahead, the report warns the situation could worsen and the gains be reversed if the substantial funding gap is not filled. The existing control approach has taken a short-term view with heavy reliance on treatment and cure. But the health systems of many countries have simply been ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of managing tuberculosis, a fact proven by the escalating rates of MDR and XDR disease.</p> </blockquote> <p>It calls on UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to break the gridlock, by setting up a global commission on TB elimination, which should recommend a fresh strategic approach by September next year.</p>",
  "<p>The imminent badger cull in England is a \"bad deal for taxpayers\", according to an agricultural economist who worked on a landmark 10-year trial examining if culling can curb TB in cattle. The <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovine-tb-impact-assessment.pdf\" title=\"\">government's own impact assessment</a> for the policy concluded that the cull, aimed at curbing rising tuberculosis in cattle, would cost more than it saves.</p> <p>\"Culling has never turned out to be worth it in strictly economic terms,\" said Prof John McInerney, at the University of Exeter. \"It is a good deal for the farmers, but a bad deal for the taxpayers, in strict economic terms.\" He noted his analysis could not account for the social costs of the 26,000 cattle sent to slaughter in 2011.</p> <p>McInerney's analysis is based on the government's initial cost estimates. He found it would cost \u00a31.55m to conduct the government's cull for four years, over an area of 150 square kilometres. If this reduced TB infections in cattle by the 16% ministers hope, this would save only \u00a30.97m in reduced compensation and testing. Taxpayers bear most of the cost, he calculated, particularly due to high expected costs of policing protests against the cull. But farmers get more of the benefit, spending \u00a3215,000 but gaining \u00a3320,000 due to fewer cattle infections.</p> <p>But a spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said the cull would bring economic benefits in the longer term. \"It is of benefit to taxpayers as well as farmers. We will start to see the benefits to when the number of bovine TB infections are starting to fall.\" Defra estimates that on current trends, dealing with TB in cattle will cost \u00a31bn in the next decade. Ministers hope the cull will reduce cattle infections in the cull zones, but many scientists say the cull could actually increase infections. The National Farmers' Union pointed out that dealing with bovine TB has cost \u00a3500m in the past decade.</p> <p>Sources have told the Guardian that the cost estimates for the two pilot culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset have risen from initial estimates. Furthermore, the cull areas are about twice as large as the area used in McInerney's analysis. If the pilot culls show shooting free-running badgers is an acceptable method of killing, then 10 culling zones could be licenced a year, meaning taxpayers will be millions of pounds worse off than if nothing was done. Both sides of the debate say action is necessary, but cull opponents argue that improved measures to prevent cattle-to-cattle infections, better biosecurity and more vaccination are better options.</p> <p>At a press conference on Wednesday on the science of the badger cull, Prof Robbie McDonald, at the University of Exeter and former head of wildlife science at the government's Food and Environment Research Agency, said: \"Managing wildlife to reduce TB in cattle is likely to produce unimpressive results.\" His research <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0039250#pone-0039250-t004\" title=\"\">modelled the impact of the imminent cull</a>, which differs significantly from the landmark randomised badger culling trial. The latter showed culling hard for a many years could reduce TB infections in cattle by 16%. Other research by McDonald showed measure to keep <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028941#top\" title=\"\">badgers out of farm buildings are 100% effective if used</a>, but noted that cattle might still contract TB from badgers in fields.</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">32 eminent scientists wrote to the Observer</a> calling on the government to abandon the cull. On Wednesday, Prof Rowland Kao, at the University of Glasgow, told journalists: \"It is not principally a science-based policy.\" Prof Christl Donnelly, at Imperial College London and who was a key member of the RBCT team, said neither the cull in England or the preferred vaccination programme in Wales could claim full scientific justification: \"Science cannot be used to give the stamp of approval to either policy.\"</p> <p>But Andrew Praill, president of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, said a cull was required to attempt to control TB: \"The killing of badgers is an unfortunate necessity.\" McInerney said it was ultimately a \"political\" decision.</p> <p>\u2022 The original article said \"McInerney's analysis is based on ... an area of 150 kilometres squared.\" That should have been 150 square kilometres, now corrected.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Two parliamentary committees are due to question tax officials about how Starbucks has been able to avoid paying tax on \u00a31.2bn of sales since 2009.</p> <p>MPs said that reports of a Reuters investigation showing Starbucks had been telling investors its UK business was highly profitable, while telling the authorities it was lossmaking and therefore not liable for tax, undermined public trust in the tax system.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, is one of several MPs who have called for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to launch an investigation into Starbucks' tax affairs.</p> <p>Hodge said the head of HMRC and other officials would be testifying to the committee next month and there were \"questions to answer\" about Starbucks' practices.</p> <p>There is no evidence that Starbucks has engaged in any kind of wrongdoing, and the company said it paid its tax in Britain to the letter of the law.</p> <p>Defending the company against public anger at the news of its tax bill, Starbucks' UK managing director Kris Engskov issued a <a href=\"http://starbucks.co.uk/blog/starbucks-commitment-to-the-uk/1240\" title=\"\">lengthy post on the company's blog</a>.</p> <p>In an initial version he wrote: \"The most important thing to understand is that Starbucks does pay tax in the UK. Indeed over the last three years we have paid over \u00a3160m in various taxes, including Pay As You Earn for our 8,500 UK employees, national insurance and business rates.\"</p> <p>The post was subsequently changed to remove the reference to PAYE, which is a tax on employees' earnings, not on businesses, but the figure of \u00a3160m remained. The company said \u00a387m of that was VAT \u2013 which is a tax on consumers.</p> <p>Engskov's post added: \"The truth of the matter is, the one tax that has been debated in the media, corporation tax, is based on the profits we make in this country \u2013 and regrettably we are not yet as profitable as we'd like to be. Is our ambition to be much more profitable, and therefore pay more corporation tax? Absolutely right, and that is why we are making long-term investments in the UK, creating new jobs, opening new stores and delivering new and innovative products for our customers.\"</p> <p>Engskov glossed over Starbucks' contradictory official statements on the UK business. According to the original Reuters investigation, in 2007, the company's chief operating officer, Martin Coles, told analysts in a fourth quarter results presentation that the UK unit's profits were funding Starbucks' expansion in overseas markets. A year later, after filing a \u00a326m loss in the UK, Starbucks' chief executive, Howard Schultz, told investors the business here was so successful he planned to apply the lessons to the company's biggest market, in the US.</p> <p>The chief financial officer, Troy Alstead, also called the UK business \"profitable\" in 2009 after accounts revealed a record \u00a352m loss, Reuters said.</p> <p>George Mudie, the chair of the Treasury subcommittee, said he also planned to question HMRC officials about Starbucks as part of their regular appearance before the committee.</p> <p>He said he hoped the subcommittee could hear from Starbucks executives, although he noted he would need broader subcommittee support to call the company to testify.</p> <p>Labour MP John Mann, a Labour MP on the subcommittee, said he would like it to hold an investigation focusing on Starbucks, but Mudie said this was unlikely.</p> <p>HMRC does not comment on individual taxpayers and rejected any challenge to its efficacy. \"We make sure that multinationals pay the right tax to the UK in accordance with UK tax law,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>Tory MP Steve Baker also called for an inquiry. \"I am a highly free market person but what I want is simple transparent tax law that is actually obeyed \u2026 There are some serious questions to answer here,\" he said.</p> <p>Taxpayer confidentiality means HMRC would not be able to confirm an investigation even if it did launch one.</p> <p>Baker and Hodge said the government could get around this and reassure the public the matter was not being ignored by confirming in parliament that an HMRC investigation was taking place.</p> <p>Starbucks declined to say whether it was considering any changes to its accounting practices, but said it was \"totally committed to the UK\".</p> <p>\"Starbucks pays and will continue to pay our share of taxes in the UK to the letter of the law,\" said Engskov.</p> <p>He went on to note Starbucks' contribution to the UK economy as an employer and as a customer for farmers and cake makers.</p>",
  "<p>A jury in the trial of the man accused of supplying a gun to Mark Duggan minutes before he was shot dead by police has been discharged after failing to reach a verdict.</p> <p>Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, denied the charge of \"selling or transferring a prohibited firearm\" to Duggan, whose shooting in Tottenham, north London, on 4 August 2011 triggered the English riots.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service said it would seek a retrial. The developments mean the inquest into Duggan's death, which would be the first public airing of the evidence surrounding the shooting, is likely to be delayed from its scheduled start of January 2013.</p> <p>The jury of seven men and five women at Snaresbrook crown court was unable to reach a verdict after nearly 21 hours of deliberations over four days. At least ten out of the twelve members needed to agree.</p> <p>During the trial, the prosecution alleged Duggan collected the BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun 15 minutes before he was shot dead.</p> <p>The trial saw fresh details emerge of the police account of what happened when officers confronted him on that day. The marksman who shot Duggan said he had \"absolutely no doubt\" the 29-year-old was holding a gun and preparing to fire.</p> <p>The officer, known only as V53, said his account of the shooting was compiled three days later, when he and his colleagues spent more than eight hours sitting in a room together writing their statements. He said they were aware of the rules about officers conferring and had discussed the incident among themselves before writing their statements.</p> <p>Hutchinson-Foster's defence was that he had not passed the gun to Duggan and that the jury could not be sure the evidence from police officers was correct.</p> <p>The CPS alleged Duggan travelled in a minicab on 4 August to pick up the weapon from Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London, and was being followed by undercover officers.</p> <p>As the minicab reached Ferry Lane in Tottenham, officers decided to carry out a \"hard stop\" \u2013 forcing the vehicle to a halt.</p> <p>The jury heard that Duggan and Hutchinson-Foster exchanged four phone calls in the hour before they say the weapon was collected. During a four-minute stop in Leyton, Duggan was seen being handed a shoe box, the court was told.</p> <p>Edward Brown QC, prosecuting, said Hutchinson-Foster admitted using the same gun in an attack on a barber six days earlier. He pistol-whipped Peter Osadebay with the gun at the Lagoon salon on Kingsland Road, Dalston, east London, on 29 July. Traces of Osadebay's blood were found on the gun when it was retrieved from Ferry Lane on 4 August, as was Hutchinson-Foster's DNA, the court heard.</p> <p>The shoebox was found in the minicab and had both Duggan's and Hutchinson-Foster's fingerprints on it, as well as those of Desire Cox, Hutchinson-Foster's girlfriend at the time. The gun was in a black sock with the toe end ripped to expose the barrel, and the heel open to expose the cocking lever at the back.</p> <p>The jury heard from an expert witness who had been commissioned by the IPCC as part of their inquiry into the shooting.</p> <p>Professor Jonathan Clasper, an expert in bioengineering and a former army colonel from Imperial College, said an involuntary movement by Duggan, occurring after he was shot, would not explain why the gun was found 10 to 14 feet away from where he fell.</p> <p>The jury also heard that Duggan's DNA was not recovered from the weapon or sock, and nor were his fingerprints. His fingerprints were recovered from a shoebox which the gun was alleged to have been carried in.</p> <p>During the trial the officer who shot Duggan gave a dramatic account of the incident. Speaking from behind a screen, V53 said that as the minicab carrying Duggan reached Ferry Lane, a radio order was given to \"strike, strike, strike\", meaning police in unmarked cars should force the vehicle to stop. The marksman said Duggan came out of the minicab at speed.</p> <p>V53 said armed officers shouted \"armed police\" and \"stand still\" at Duggan. He did not comply, the jury was told.</p> <p>\"As I shouted 'armed police', Mark Duggan has turned to face me,\" said the officer, adding that Duggan was holding the gun at the level of his stomach. \"The only way I can describe it \u2026 is as an 'oh fuck' moment. He has got a gun and he is going to use it on me.</p> <p>\"Mark Duggan was holding a handgun in his right hand. He was holding the pistol grip or the handle of the gun. I could make out the shape and outline of the gun. I could make out the trigger guard.\"</p> <p>The officer said the gun was covered by a sock and he could make out the gun barrel.</p> <p>He said Duggan was moving the barrel away from his body, into the \"aim position\". Armed with an MP5 submachine gun, the officer said he shot Duggan in the chest to stop him, not to kill him: \"I had an honest held belief that Mark Duggan was going to shoot me or one of my colleagues.\"</p> <p>After the first shot Duggan made a \"flinching movement\" but still had the gun in his right hand and V53 fired again, striking the right biceps, the jury was told.</p> <p>Duggan fell to the floor. Another officer shouted: \"I'm hit, I'm hit,\" after a ricochet from his colleague struck him. The police-issue bullet struck his radio.</p> <p>V53 stressed to the jury that he was certain of thiskey aspect of his account, saying he was 100% sure Duggan was holding a gun when challenged by police.</p> <p>The family of Mark Duggan said they felt their loved one had been put on trial during the prosecution case against Hutchinson-Foster. They said many of the claims had not been heard by them before.</p> <p>Shaun Hall, Mark Duggan's brother, said: \"It feels like this has been the Mark Duggan trial, except his family has had no representation and without being able to defend himself.</p> <p>\"People have been allowed to say things in court about Mark and what happened that day without being challenged. We heard things that we had never heard before. As a family we still are no closer to finding out the truth about why Mark was killed.\"</p> <p>Marcia Willis Stewart, the Duggan family solicitor, said: \"The evidence and conclusions of this trial should not prejudice and pre-empt the inquest itself.\"</p>",

It was not a bad performance by Romney but Obama edged him out on the night.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks very much for reading, and don't forget to check out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/obama-romney-second-debate-live\">Richard Adams' live coverage of the debate.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e1dad58f91d7bbadac756\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T02:53:33.736Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0nb6UT3T1rg2rf7o1_500.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Will Romney's performance still leave him struggling to win over women voters?

  "<p>Why, oh why do I continue not just to let myself down but <em>all</em> women? I had to ask myself this after <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9760000/9760248.stm\" title=\"\">I had a ding-dong with Mehdi Hasan on the Today programme this week over his views on whether you can be \"pro-life\" and leftwing</a>. Hasan had written an article in the New Statesman in which he laid out a fairly standard anti-abortion stance. I refute the term \"pro-life\" to describe opposition to abortion, as I am pro-life \u2013 the lives of women.</p> <p>Hasan was then very shocked by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iv-drip/has-prolifer-mehdi-hasan-been-victimised-on-twitter-8212873.html\" title=\"\">the abuse he got on Twitter</a>, and some of it was vile. Comparing him to Jimmy Savile was a little excessive. But his replies felt, to many of us women, arrogant and dismissive. What is for Hasan an interesting philosophical dilemma is actually experienced in reality through our bodies. He also played the emotional card of seeing the scan of his daughter at 20 weeks. I too have seen such scans. Once at 20 weeks I was told the baby was dead and I would just have to wait to miscarry. If all the bits didn't come out they said I would probably be back soon via A&amp;E as I would be infected. So we can all get sentimental over scans. Having also had an ultrasound before an abortion I am in no denial about what that feels like either.</p> <p>Many others have also in effect rebutted Hasan's views and I admire much of his other writing. So when the Today progamme asked me to debate this with him, I was reluctant. I don't listen to the show because rather like Newsnight at its worst, the \"lets have a heated debate\" structure is tired and goes nowhere. Plus my last experience of the Today programme was being harangued by John Pilger saying that the women who have made accusations against Julian Assange were probably working for the CIA. Life's too short for Today, I feel.</p> <p>Really, though, I should have made like Obama and gone to a training camp where they teach you how to debate. But the truth is that the Oxbridgey petty point-scoring, the bland but setup confrontations and lack of honesty is precisely what puts many off politics completely. It certainly does me. Maybe I am never going to learn it; probably because I don't want to?</p> <p>On this occasion, John Humphrys was chairing, so I pointed out that here we were on a programme that has a poor record of female participation, with two men and one woman discussing abortion. Humphrys said they had \"Sarah [Montague] yesterday\"! That's sorted then! I also asked Hasan and Humphries about their reproductive histories and contraceptive methods. I would deduce coitus interruptus. We ended up talking over each other \u2013 neither mine or Hasan's finest hour, to be honest. Having had civil exchanges with him since, I am sure we could have had a better discussion in any other situation.</p> <p>Among many messages of support afterwards, there was also a torrent of abuse. I was shrill, hysterical, hectoring, \"a feminist\", a disgrace and drunk. Woman, know thy limits. Mainly, I was \"disrespectful\". This is an interesting take on a discussion about what I may do with the contents of my own womb. Humphrys's famous BBC \"impartiality\" was on display again this week when he aggressively challenged Harriet Harman over the definition of sexual abuse. This is either hard-hitting interviewing or a dismal and anachronistic attitude given what we now know.</p> <p>Then came a whole other lot of nastiness as Cristina Odone, with nothing better to do, wrote a blog in the Daily Telegraph saying that I told \"<a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100185150/why-wont-feminists-let-men-debate-abortion/\" title=\"\">the Today audience that men are banned from debating abortion</a>\". She also claimed that babies born at 20 weeks can survive. Both these things are untrue. (<a href=\"http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/sites/default/files/files/CCD%20Chapter%205%20Dilemmas%20in%20current%20practice%20babies%20born%20at%20the%20borderline%20of%20viability.pdf\" title=\"\">Borderline viability </a>is usually described as <a href=\"http://www.sepeap.org/archivos/pdf/10925.pdf\" title=\"\">21 to 25 weeks</a>.) Anyone may disagree with my opinion, but this is remarkably shoddy journalism. Does the Telegraph not check its facts?</p> <p>Of course men can and do discuss abortion. Men are involved as partners and medics. Indeed, I continue to admire David Steel and his compadres who pushed through the 1967 Abortion Act not to win votes (scarcely imaginable in a politician now) but to stop women dying.</p> <p>What I would prefer, though, is for women to lead the discussion rather than sit there while men discuss what we are permitted to do. The Today programme, with its adversarial setup, was never going to do that and I should have known better. Of all the things I said, one of the worst was \"I am in a van\", because you are meant to pretend that you are in a studio, not a radio car. But I found it ludicrously silly that I was indeed in a van being patronised by two guys.</p> <p>Still, the next time someone has the news not \"just in\" \u2013 the dearth of women on front pages, on discussion panels, on TV and radio, in what passes for political debate \u2013 I will simply remind you that to stick up for yourself will involve being misrepresented and nastily insulted. I won't be getting out of bed for such treatment again and, let's face it, I am unlikely to be asked.

That, some commentators believe, is a clear signal to Italy to join Spain in seeking help from the EU to draw a line under the euro crisis.</p> <p>Here's some analysis on Blanchard's comments from our economics correspondent Phillip Inman:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The controversial IMF adviser, who recently upset Germany and the UK by announcing that austerity hurt economic growth by more than previously thought, said it was crucial to have a funding plan for both countries.</p> <p>Without a line of credit to Rome from the EU and the IMF, the fear is that Italy will face the same investor backlash as that suffered by Spain. Mario Monti is adamant Italy is in a stronger position, but what is interesting is that Blanchard disagrees.</p> <p>At the IMF's annual meetings in Tokyo last week it was obvious that European leaders were being beaten up verbally behind closed doors over their handling of the Greek/Spain bailout debacle. If Italy becomes another domino after a Spanish bailout the anger could be uncontainable (to use a word adopted by Bank of England deputy Paul Tucker in relation to another banking crisis).</p> </blockquote> <p>Monti has been keeping a rather low profile recently -- letting Mariano Rajoy 'enjoy' the spotlight instead.

Another opportunity to impose authority over the section has been passed up, the overriding emotion at the end here one of relief that at least a point had been preserved. If the pitch was soggy, the display was sloppy.</p> <p>This all felt depressingly unsatisfactory, the tone set early as simple passes flew into touch and maintained through a period when the visitors held an unlikely lead. Even that was a scruffy goal, plucked from a set-piece and looped in from Wayne Rooney's shoulder, with England's slickest exchanges reserved for the latter stages when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injected zip to their approach as they urgently sought to restore their advantage. The manager conceded this had been one of his team's less impressive performances. In that context, it should be considered encouraging that a point was squeezed from the fixture at all.</p> <p>The frustration was that, with experienced players on the pitch and the hosts' own confidence notoriously brittle, the lead could not be retained. Half-chances had been spurned on the break by Jermain Defoe and Rooney, the latter skying over the bar after Danny Welbeck sprinted clear and round the goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton to pull a pass back from the byline.</p> <p>At that stage the Poles appeared to be wilting, their conviction draining quicker than the sodden pitch, only for England to doze off. Ludovic Obraniak's corner moments later prompted panic, Joe Hart missing when punching down the wrong line, and Joleon Lescott shrinking as Kamil Glik headed gleefully into the empty net. Polish football is prone to hard luck stories. This was deserved reward.</p> <p>It was the lack of tempo and poise to England's display that felt most dispiriting. Hodgson could point to the pitch and the postponement as reason for the stodgy passages of play \u2013 although it did not appear to affect the Poles quite as obviously \u2013 with vague suggestions that it is \"a bit easier to recover for a rearranged game if you're on home soil\". That soil was still drenched, reminders of the fiasco the night before omnipresent. England appeared slack and devoid of focus at times, as the manager freely admitted. It was as if body clocks had been thrown by the shifting of the fixture back 20 hours after the waterlogging the previous day, with the players struggling to shrug themselves awake.</p> <p>Hodgson conceded there had been more pizzazz the previous day as players prepared. \"I had the impression earlier in the week that the players were looking sharp and lively,\" he said. \"I didn't have that impression today.\" He could curse the heavens for that much. The colossal tarpaulin roof had actually been opened and closed regularly throughout the day, as if taunting those fans who could not attend the rescheduled game, as the locals sought to dry the surface so there was an irony this game kicked off with autumnal sunshine pouring through the concourse under the canopy. Even so, the turf was heavy after the previous day's deluge, the ball skidding on in places and slowing up in others. Hodgson described it as \"dead\". It certainly appeared to sap energy from much of the approach play his team&#xa0;summoned.</p> <p>Poland, justifiably, could argue that their own efforts to counter at pace were too often stifled at source, though they carried the more potent threat. Lukasz Piszczek and Kamil Grosicki tore into Ashley Cole, the left-back exposed with Tom Cleverley tucked infield, but the pitch was too stodgy for the Poles to generate proper momentum. Cole, making his 99th appearance, benefited from little support even once Oxlade-Chamberlain had entered the fray. Sometimes there is complacency when it comes to the Chelsea defender, an assumption he can deal with all-comers. Piszczek was a tricky opponent throughout, with Hart suffocating a loose ball at his feet early on.</p> <p>Grosicki scuffed wide with England flustered. Michael Carrick's radar was scrambled and Rooney a mess of misplaced deliveries. Even Hart's composure was suspect, his fluffed clearance surrendering possession with Robert Lewandowski fizzing a shot across goal and wide.</p> <p>Then, out of the carelessness, Steven Gerrard barged forward to win a corner and, with the Poles dawdling and disorganised, Rooney converted the captain's delivery. His 32nd goal at this level felt unexpected, his departure for Oxlade-Chamberlain less so. \"I know I can play better than that,\" conceded the Manchester United forward. \"But the pitch took a lot out of your legs.\"</p> <p>Some of the forward's better work had been in retreat, seeking to check Polish attacks, but with Rooney, Carrick, Gerrard and a relatively reassuring backline on the pitch, the visitors had reason to hope they could cling on. That sense was only heightened when the home side's eager opening to the second half was weathered and anxiety spread around the arena. But those England fans who had been able to make the rearranged game \u2013 barely half the original 2,500 travelling supporters appeared to be in attendance \u2013 were to be denied their win.</p> <p>Glik's equaliser redressed the balance and means that, by the time England travel to Montenegro in March, they could be two points behind their hosts in Podgorica. Improvement is required. \"We know we'll have to improve to qualify,\" added Rooney. \"But at least we got a point.\" There was relief to be had in that.</p>",

That is the clearest indication of their lack of political will and initiative.

There are practical problems with it, but if there is political will you can see how things can be over turned. But you don\u2019t see any attempt at doing that - We have seen very few visits by SNC leaders.</p> </blockquote> <p>If credible a leadership does not emerge inside the country, Syria faces five more years of civil war, he warned. Syrians will give up on the uprising if they don\u2019t get clarity from the opposition about the alternatives to the Assad regime, he argued.</p> <p>Calls by the international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi for a ceasefire are a \u201ccosmetic\u201d exercise to try to show that something is being done, Sharro added. The countries backing Brahimi\u2019s mission are also \"fuelling the fire\" in Syria, he claimed.</p> <p>The current international squabble for regional dominance over Syria is frustrating the emergence of opposition leaders, Sharro argued. Saudi Arabia, for example, should stop funding Salafist groups, because they are distorting the conflict, and thwarting the growth of a more organic opposition inside Syria.</p> <p>Sharro called for the conflict to become \u201cdeinteranationalized\u201d.</p> <p>He criticised the west\u2019s \u201creluctant meddling\u201d on Syria as stuck between neither fully committing to arming the rebels, nor finding a peaceful solution. \u201cBoth the US and the international community are making matters worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Members of the current regime, such as vice president Farouq al-Sharaa, could play a role in an alternative government to avoid the disaster that occur in Iraq following de-Ba\u2019athification, Sharro said.

  "<p>On Tuesday, the British government announced that it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-timeline-extradition\">refusing to extradite computer hacker Gary McKinnon</a> to the United States. McKinnon, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, had been sought for extradition by the United States because he repeatedly hacked into government computer systems. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/16/gary_mckinnon_talha_ahsan_theresa_may_announces_u_k_will_not_extradite_alien.html\">Theresa May, the Cameron government's Home secretary, declared</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Mr McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that the decision to extradite would be incompatible with his human rights.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Because of his illness, McKinnon's case is somewhat unique. But it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the decision by a conservative government of one of America's staunchest allies not to extradite him reflects increasing international skepticism about US criminal justice process.</p> <p>On its face, May's announcement may seem surprising. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/world/europe/britain-refuses-to-extradite-computer-hacker-sought-in-us.html?_r=1&amp;\">The charges against McKinnon</a> \u2013 that he deliberately impaired government computers, causing more than $500,000-worth of damage \u2013 are not trivial. McKinnon has not denied the hacking, although he has said that he was merely looking for hidden government evidence of UFOs and other conspiracies. It's not unreasonable for a government to protect the security of its computer systems. Given the close ties between the US and UK, it might be expected that the question of what extent McKinnon's Asperger's syndrome mitigates the offenses with which he is charged would be determined by an American court. </p> <p>In a broader context, though, the extradition order becomes more troubling and British skepticism understandable. This starts with the law governing the extradition process. A relic of the Blair government's complete capitulation to the Bush administration over the \"war on terror\", the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_Act_2003\">treaty under which the US sought McKinnon's extradition</a> is notably lacking in due process protections \u2013 even for British citizens accused of crimes while on British soil. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, while sold as essential to combating terrorism, the broad latitude afforded by the treaty has been used to request the extradition of suspects who (like McKinnon) are not terrorist suspects. May's determination that the extradition order would violate the Human Rights Act of 1998 likely reflects a retrospective determination that the 2003 treaty did not adequately protect the interests of British citizens. </p> <p>There are two additional reasons to be skeptical about the American government's request. First, it's hard to ignore the egregious double standards the US government has applied in cases broadly related to the \"war on terror\". The <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/torture-without-accountability\">Obama administration has refused to prosecute</a> any of the Bush administration's human rights abuses, while, on the other hand, it has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/obama-campaign-brags-about-whistleblower-persecutions\">very aggressively prosecuted whistleblowers</a>. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that this will have made even allies less likely to take at face value criminal charges laid by the US government.</p> <p>Even more problematic, and likely to be an increasing difficulty with regardt to American requests for extradition, is the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/01/30/120130crat_atlarge_gopnik\">extraordinarily punitive American criminal justice system</a>. The scale of incarceration in the US makes it a massive outlier among liberal democracies, and this scandalous state of affairs has to affect every extradition decision. The British government cannot, in fact, reasonably be confident that the charges against McKinnon would be balanced against a fair consideration of his illness. McKinnon would have faced up to 60 years in prison if convicted, and it would never be wise to assume that the American criminal justice system won't issue a disproportionately harsh sentence. </p> <p>The Cameron government's refusal to extradite McKinnon certainly reflects the idiosyncratic facts of his individual case. But it almost definitely also reflects the damage done to the reputation of the United States by a completely broken criminal justice system. It's impossible for even the staunchest of US allies to look the other way when faced with the misplaced priorities and brutal mass incarceration that characterize the American practice of criminal law.</p> <p>The realities of domestic politics make meaningful reform of these injustices enormously difficult, so the international reputation of the US will continue to suffer. And there will be increasing numbers of cases in which countries refuse to extradite people to face charges in American courts.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is urging the Palestinian leadership to delay its bid for upgraded status at the United Nations general assembly, warning that the move is likely to be detrimental to US re-engagement with the peace process following next month's presidential election.</p> <p>Palestinian sources expressed anger at the British move, saying the UK had been recruited to US opposition to their bid. But they insisted they would press for a vote on their UN status by 15 November and were confident of winning a majority. At least 115 countries, and possibly as many as 150, out of a total of 193, are forecast to vote in favour of upgraded \"non-member state\" status.</p> <p>British diplomats have told Palestinian officials that a vote in the weeks following the US election would significantly decrease the chances of the next US administration taking steps to get peace negotiations re-started. They are also warning of potentially serious financial consequences for the Palestinian Authority if it goes ahead.</p> <p>They say they understand the Palestinians' frustration after at least a year of stagnation in the peace process while Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have continued to expand, threatening the viability of a Palestinian state. \"There is a lack of a political horizon, lack of hope for their people and continued economic uncertainty. It's very bleak at the moment,\" said a diplomatic source.</p> <p>However, they added that a UN vote on upgrading the Palestinians' status would seriously complicate US re-engagement in the peace process, which British and other European countries are urging in the coming months. \"We want to see the US take a lead once the presidential elections are out of the way. The US role is key and we stand ready to help them,\" the source said.</p> <p>The US has clearly stated its opposition to the Palestinians' UN move. Its envoy, Susan Rice, said on Monday it would \"jeopardise the peace process\". The Palestinians counter that there is no viable peace process and they are pursuing an alternative peaceful and diplomatic international strategy.</p> <p>Last month, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/us-warns-europe-palestinians-un\" title=\"\">US memorandum warned European governments</a> against supporting the Palestinian bid, saying such a move \"would be extremely counterproductive\" and threatening \"significant negative consequences\" for the Palestinian Authority, including financial sanctions.</p> <p>After last year's failed attempt to win full recognition for the state of Palestine, the US Congress froze $200m (\u00a3123m) in aid to the authority. The decision was later overturned, but diplomats say the money has yet to be dispersed while the US waits to see the outcome of this year's UN move.</p> <p>According to Palestinian sources, the US is also trying to raise the threshold for a successful vote at the general assembly from a simple majority to two-thirds. \"They are playing every card they can. But even if they do get it changed to two-thirds, we are still going to win,\" said a Palestinian official.</p> <p>Israel is also vehemently opposed to the Palestinian move. An upgrade from \"observer entity\" to \"non-member observer state\" would give the Palestinians access to bodies such as the international criminal court, in which they could seek to pursue legal cases against Israel over settlements, the occupation of the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza.</p> <p>Britain views 2013 as a critical year for the future of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, warning that continued settlement expansion in East Jerusalem and the West Bank is jeopardising the prospects of a Palestinian state being created alongside Israel.</p> <p>\"We're trying to think creatively about how we move forward. But it's difficult if, in the same breath, we're having to think tactically about how to handle a UN bid. So our message to the Palestinians is that going to the UN straightaway could be counterproductive and that a bit more time will help us to help them,\" said a diplomatic source.</p> <p>Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, has been invited to London before the end of the month to discuss the UN bid with UK government officials.</p> <p>Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, said: \"We are trying to do our best to rescue the two-state solution, prevent violence and bring international law to bear.</p> <p>\"The Americans are perfectly capable of doing Israel's work without recruiting the UK to help. The UK has a long history in this region and should be the first to recognise the damage it caused to the Palestinians in the past. They owe us at least the minimum of even-handedness.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UK foreign office said: \"We have been clear that we see negotiations toward a two-state solution as the best way to meet the national aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. Along with EU and international partners we are urging both sides to focus on dialogue, to avoid steps that could undermine the prospects for peace and to work towards the resumption of direct negotiations without preconditions.</p> <p>\"If a [general assembly] resolution were to be put to a vote, we would need to consider our position. The UK would want to use its vote in a way that makes a return to talks more, rather than less, likely.\"</p>",
  "<p>Neither presidential candidate were fully open during the debate when it came to the issue of guns, one of the most contentious and arguably least thoroughly debated subjects in American society.</p> <p>Asked what had happened to his promise, made during the 2008 presidential race, to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals, Barack Obama signaled that he was prepared to see \"if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced\". </p> <p>That was in tune with occasional comments from Obama administration officials in favour of renewing the Federal Assault Weapons Ban on the manufacture of semi-automatic weapons that was introduced by Bill Clinton in 1994 but allowed to lapse by George Bush 10 years later.</p> <p>However, there has been no sign that the Obama administration is genuinely prepared to expend political capital on driving such a renewal of the ban through a Republican-controlled House of Representatives or to incur by doing so the wrath of the powerful gun-lobby and the National Rifle Association. </p> <p>Josh Sugarmann, head of the gun control advocacy group the Violence Policy Center, pointed out that Obama could have made an impact on the number of AK-47s and other such semi-automatic rifles in the country by wielding powers he already possesses to ban the import of foreign weapons that do not pass a \"sporting purposes test\".</p> <p>On Romney's part, he defended his opposition to any new gun controls by saying that there was already a ban in place for fully automatic weapons. That is not correct \u2013 it is possible for civilians to own such weapons if they are prepared to go through extended federal background checks including fingerprinting and pay a $200 tax.</p> <p>\"To say that fully automatic weapons don't exist in civilian hands is inaccurate,\" Sugarmann said.</p>",

Andy recently carried out some work with the trust to help it improve its performance.</p> <p>He says he encourages staff to \"know their numbers\", such as how many operations are due to take place, how many free hospital beds they need to get though a bank holiday weekend etc. His says this helps a team have ownership of their own performance.</p> <p>Jo asked Andy to work with them on a better, more joined up way to deliver performance. She said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were managing our performance entirely in silos. What we weren't doing is looking at it as a whole.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>She added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The one thing we have learnt is that we spend all our time looking back at where we failed, not looking forward for performance delivery.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Andy also talked about the importance of checking whether targets are met.

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/naomiwolf\" title=\"\">Naomi Wolf</a>: Julia Gillard used the word accurately</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397944027\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/19/1319042149039/Naomi-Wolf-003.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Wolf\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Wolf Photograph: Unknown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Unknown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I object to more heightened words being appropriated carelessly to make political points: sexism is not in fact misogyny; someone can like women quite a lot in person but be very happy to support systematic discrimination against them (sexism) or to use gender stereotypes against them (sexism). So I am sorry to see the dictionary conflating the terms. Sexism is to misogyny what antisemitism is to Jew-hating. Neither is ever acceptable, but we need precise language to understand and fight injustice effectively.</p> <p>Having said that, Julia Gillard <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/09/australia-pm-gillard-misogynist-video\" title=\"\">used \"misogyny' perfectly accurately</a>. She said that Tony Abbott described abortion as \"the easy way out\" and cited his political campaign against Gillard involving posters asking voters to \"ditch the witch\". The latter, especially, is a time-honoured tradition of true misogyny \u2013 stirring up atavistic hatred of the feminine \u2013 that goes back to witch-hunts against powerful women in the New World. Her critics, for their part, are asking us to water down our awareness of real woman-hating and accept it as normal in political discourse.</p> <p>\"Misogyny\" often surfaces in political struggles over women's role, and you can tell because the control of women becomes personalised, intrusive and often sexualised. Misogyny has the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala\" title=\"\">amygdala</a> involved \u2013 the part of the brain involved in processing emotional responses \u2013 there is contempt and violence in it. A public figure who tolerates the systemic under-prosecuting of rape is guilty of serious and unforgivable sexism; making rape jokes or explaining away the damage of rape in public <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/republican-todd-akin-rape-pregnancy\" title=\"\">as Congressman Todd Akin did</a> recently in the US, or legislating, as over a dozen US states are now doing, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/feb/21/abortion-women-state-sponsored-rape\" title=\"\">transvaginal probes that are medically unnecessary</a>, simply to sexually punish women for choosing abortion \u2013 well, that is misogyny.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliebindel\" title=\"\">Julie Bindel</a>: Sexists are not always misogynists</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397944028\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/7/1336385068454/Julie-Bindel.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Bindel\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When a man claims that women are naturally maternal, or are by default, bad drivers, he is a sexist. If he was to add that women are only good for a fuck and should be confined to servicing men and their children, it is misogyny. Misogynists are always sexist, but sexists are not always misogynists. For example, if a man says of a woman, \"Look at the state of that fat, ugly cow, I wouldn't touch her with yours,\" then he is a misogynist. It would follow that he does not respect women as equals and is therefore also a sexist.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nina-power\" title=\"\">Nina Power</a>: Being misogynist, acting sexist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397944029\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/14/1318592406444/nina-power.jpg\" alt=\"Nina Power\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In a moment of idle curiosity a good few years ago, I wondered whether there was an antonym for misogyny. I presumed it would be something like \"philogyny\" and it was indeed \u2013 \"fondness towards women\". After the definition, a short note in parenthesis: \"usage: rare\" (and today, too, the spellchecker has red-underlined the word. Apparently liking women has not become any more popular in the computer age!) What a depressing dictionary note, I thought: we talk about misogyny all the time, and yet the opposite is nowhere to be found.</p> <p>Misogyny, and philogyny for that matter, seems to imply an essential state of being, perhaps an inability to change an outlook, a claim about what that person is. Sexism, on the other hand, is perhaps more often linked to acts and words \u2013 \"so this person wrote this tweet that was sexist, but it doesn't mean he hates women\", that sort of thing. The interchangeable use of the terms may be in keeping with contemporary usage, but we might want to make a quiet plea to hold open the distinction, if only so the antonym for \"hating women\" might one day usurp its partner in popularity.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rahilagupta\" title=\"\">Rahila Gupta</a>: A murky pond in which misogyny flourishes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397944030\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/rahila_gupta_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Rahila Gupta\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We all know that sexism is the pond in which misogyny flourishes and because the water is so murky, you sometimes don't even notice how healthily it grows. And because it is growing in water, it sometimes reflects back at you as love instead of hate. To be specific, sexism is when men let you jump the queue and get on a crowded bus first in Delhi (to confuse matters further, that's called chivalry) and then the poor dears, willy nilly, get crushed up against you as their hands \"accidentally\" cup your breasts in a frenzy of misogyny.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rhiannon-lucy-cosslett\" title=\"\">Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a>: Something darker and angrier</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397944031\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/23/1335184621044/Rhiannon-Williams.jpg\" alt=\"Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sexism is to misogyny what Benny Hill is to Rush Limbaugh. While sexism demonstrates a disregard and disrespect for women, I always have associated misogyny with something darker, angrier, and more cynical. Things like Page 3 often betray a failure to move with the times, a certain outdated attitude about women's roles that has the potential to be modernised. But educating someone out of the blinkered hatred of misogyny is a monumental challenge. To think, as the Republicans do, that the male half of society should be able to legislate and control the bodies of the female half, well, that can be nothing but misogyny.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/bidisha\" title=\"\">Bidisha</a>: Two sexist remarks and one misogynist one</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397944032\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/07/29/bidisha_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Bidisha 140\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At a major literary festival, before an event about military fiction, a posh famous English author smirked to me, \"What's the difference between a woman and a piece of toast? You can make soldiers from toast.\" That's sexist.</p> <p>When boarding a flight from Geneva to London a man followed his wife on to the plane and said at the top of his voice to her, \"The plane went down when you got on it,\" which prompted gasps from everyone around including the cabin staff, while he smirked and the woman looked like she wanted to drop in to a hole in the ground and die. That's sexist.</p> <p>On a train from York to London a woman was talking on the phone in the quiet carriage. A couple near me got cross. \"I'll go and tell her it's the quiet carriage,\" said the man to us all nearby. \"Ooh, don't,\" muttered the wife. \"OK then, I'll go and punch her,\" he said. That's misogynist.</p>",

They belong in the same baroque-pop category as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/05/wild-beasts-interview\" title=\"\">Kendal's mintiest</a> and have a lead singer whose voice, tremulous at the best of times, keeps threatening to take off into operatic territory. The songs that he sings with no small flamboyance are quite florid themselves, darting this way and that, hard to categorise, with elements of electronica, the intricacy of math rock and the fussiness of prog. Early comparisons have been to bands as disparate in terms of genres and eras as the Associates, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">the xx</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/foals\" title=\"\">Foals</a>.</p> <p>Still only teenagers \u2013 and comprising four undergraduates plus one trainee Saville Row tailor \u2013 the Oxford quintet have supported <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/django-django\" title=\"\">Django Django</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/spector\" title=\"\">Spector</a> and have had their debut single, Echo, produced by Steve Osborne, whose work with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/suede\" title=\"\">Suede</a> (but probably not his work with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/neworder\" title=\"\">New Order</a>) offers some clues as to what to expect from their music. They can all play their instruments exceedingly well \u2013 that's one thing you might want to prepare for. Attendees of their gigs have been impressed by the amount of equipment onstage, and by the facility with which they handle it all. Even during soundcheck, the keyboardist knocked out a classical piece with ease while the bassist displayed serious jazz-funk \"chops\". They're not just dexterous instrumentalists, though. Two of them \u2013 Jay and Posada \u2013 operate as Cubiq, an electronic side project responsible for remixing, among others, Totally Extinct Enormous Dinosaurs.</p> <p>They catch people unawares, and we can see why. At first sight/sound, they could pass for a regular unambitious indie band, and frontman Samson for just another vocalist with an affected croon. But closer scrutiny reveals richly textured songs that change shape, dart this way and that, even suddenly shifting mid-tune. On Another Night, the band move at a gentle pace and create an almost ambient tone, interrupted only by a squeal of guitar that sounds like something that strayed in from an old Santana album. Face the Music starts at a polite bossa nova tempo before Samson becomes increasingly wound up, even as he tells himself: \"I'm still all right, she's still all right, we're both all right.\" At this point, the band resembles a particularly agitated <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/steely-dan\" title=\"\">Steely Dan</a>. On The Fallout, there are further striking transitions; by the end, it becomes an overwrought dance track.</p> <p>New single Echo is their best track so far, Samson coming within breathing distance of the octave king himself, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/apr/27/popandrock.alexispetridis\" title=\"\">Billy Mackenzie</a>, as the band effect their finest mid-song transformation, from shimmery high-strung pop to \u2013 well, one reviewer said the coda reminded him of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/redhotchilipeppers\" title=\"\">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' Under the Bridge, and that's the more likely source, but we can hear uncannily swirly echoes (sorry) of a track called When? by Spirit, taken from the LA band's 1976 post-psychedelic masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/spirit-of-76-mw0000336086\" title=\"\">Spirit of 76</a>. We wouldn't put it past Wild Swim to be familiar with that album, given the breadth of their influences and the range of their styles to date. Neither would we be surprised if the band ended up on a lot of \"ones to watch in 2013\" lists.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The anguish and despair in Richard Sansom's grave vocals accelerated as glittering arpeggios rippled along in the background and we were sold\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://beatpyramid.co.uk/2012/10/08/wild-swim-echo/\" title=\"\">Beat Pyramid</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Prepare for an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYv_onBg4wc\" title=\"\">affectionate punch</a>.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make a splash.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Drown.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Echo will be released by Believe on 26 November.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Wild Beasts, Clock Opera, Associates, James Blake.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/wildswim\" title=\"\">facebook.com/wildswim</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thursday's new band:</strong> Kilo Kish.</p>",
  "<p>Energy firms will be forced to give all of their customers the lowest tariff available under new laws announced by David Cameron.</p> <p>In response to mounting concerns over the rising cost of household energy bills \u2013 four of the UK's big six energy firms have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/15/scottish-power-raises-gas-electricity-prices\" title=\"\">already announced</a> above-inflation winter price hikes \u2013 Cameron vowed in the Commons to tackle the problem.</p> <p>\"I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers,\" he told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions.</p> <p>After the announcement, a spokesman for the prime minister said: \"We have asked energy companies to take action themselves and make clear what the lowest available deals are. The point is, in practice this market is not operating for everyone. A small minority of people are actually switching deals, therefore we need to push some of this responsibility on to the energy companies.\"</p> <p>He said customers would have to wait until energy bill was published, possibly in the autumn, for details of how the change would work in practice. The move did not mean energy companies would end up offering only one tariff, as different customers would need different rates, he said.</p> <p>\"At the moment, the way the market works, people are encouraged to switch but many people don't. It is only a minority of people who switch, so lots of people are not benefiting from that market, particularly vulnerable people who are less likely to switch deals.\"</p> <p>The announcement followed a strongly-worded <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/news/2012/10/urgent-review-of-rising-energy-prices-is-needed-299576/\" title=\"\">open letter to Cameron</a> from consumer rights group Which?, calling for an independent review into the increasing cost of domestic energy bills.</p> <p>In the letter, the group's executive director Richard Lloyd wrote: \"It's time to face facts: the energy market is broken. The sector is dominated by a handful of big and powerful players who are seemingly unaffected by the normal competitive pressure of price and customer service.\"</p> <p>In response to Cameron's announcement, Lloyd said: \"Legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers is a big statement from the prime minister and acknowledges that competition in the energy retail market has failed. This is a big moment for consumers, but we must now see these words turned into action and see the detail from the government in the energy bill [expected this autumn].\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said that households facing rising energy bills this winter \"aren't going to be helped by more inquiries or investigations that could take years to complete and implement. We know what the problems are, we want to get on with tackling them now. We're focusing on action, not more words.\"</p> <p>Energy UK, the trade association for the gas and electricity sector, was equally dismissive of the call for an independent review. Chief executive Angela Knight said: \"Rebuilding trust with customers is a priority.

  "<p>It was the moment that women's issues finally took centre stage in a presidential debate, although probably not in the way Mitt Romney would have wanted. </p> <p>Within minutes of the Republican presidential candidate uttering his now-infamous line about \"binders full of women\", the phrase had unleashed its own hashtag, Twitter and Facebook account, and a binder full of bile from critics furious at its perceived patronising tone.</p> <p>Romney used the line to demonstrate his track record on pay equality for women, claiming that when he was governor of Massachusetts he was told the only applicants for positions in his state cabinet were men.</p> <p>\"And I said: \"Well, gosh, can't we \u2013&#xa0;can't we find some \u2013 some women that are also qualified?\" Romney told the debate audience. \"And \u2013 and so we \u2013 we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said: 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women.\"</p> <p>Within minutes the phrase was trending on Twitter. But as well as being ripped apart on social media Romney also found the veracity of his claim being called into question. According to David Bernstein of the Phoenix, a Boston newspaper, the story Romney told an estimated 50-60 million viewers was untrue.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">Bernstein reported</a> that there was indeed an effort in Massachusetts to find qualified women for cabinet positions.</p> <p>But Romney nor his staff, nor even his party, had anything to do with it, he said.</p> <p>\"What actually happened was that in 2002 \u2013 prior to the election, not even knowing yet whether it would be a Republican or Democratic administration \u2013 a bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGap to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government,\" he wrote. \"There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>\"They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions. They presented this binder to Governor Romney when he was elected.\"</p> <p>Not only was Romney not involved in the effort to find qualified women, he did not pay much attention to the results, Bernstein said, debunking another of Romney's claims on the hot button topic of equality in the workplace.</p> <p>Romney told Candy Crowley, the moderator of Tuesday night's debate, of his pride at his achievements.</p> <p>\"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.</p> <p>Now, one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.\"</p> <p>Bernstein, who checked with several people involved in MassGap, who confirmed the reporters take on events, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>First of all, according to MassGAP and MWPC, Romney did appoint 14 women out of his first 33 senior-level appointments, which is a reasonably impressive 42%. However, as I have reported before, those were almost all to head departments and agencies that he didn't care about \u2013 and in some cases, that he quite specifically wanted to not really do anything. None of the senior positions Romney cared about \u2013 budget, business development, etc \u2013 went to women.</p> <p>Secondly, a UMass-Boston study found that the percentage of senior-level appointed positions held by women actually declined throughout the Romney administration, from 30.0% prior to his taking office, to 29.7% in July 2004, to 27.6% near the end of his term in November 2006.</p> </blockquote> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/10/16/fact-check-romney-record-hiring-women/r3gqpykaQudNNqigmLZfuJ/story.htm\">fact check in the Boston Globe</a> on Romney's hiring of women in the private sector also found his record there to be wanting. Romney did not have any women partners as CEO of Bain Capital during the 1980s and 1990s, it found.</p> <p>Romney has gained ground in opinion polls among women voters, a position Obama has traditionally held, since the first presidential debate.</p> <p>But his latest comments, which are unlikely to be forgotten if social media is anything to go by, will do him few favours.</p> <p>Women in a snap poll by the Democratic Lake Research Partners picked Obama as the debate winner by 56-34%. Men also gave Obama the victory, but by a narrower 49-43 percent, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-usa-campaign-women-idUSBRE89G0AY20121017\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>",

Identifying the \"victor\" is a real challenge: is it policy-based evidence, or evidence-based policy?</p> <p>But having pored through the evidence today, I find it hard to come to any other conclusion that the evidence put forward by the cull advocates - notably Defra and the NFU - just isn't strong enough to justify the current policy. Rather, it seems far too selective and fudged in its approach to be persuasive. Sadly, it bears all the hallmarks of a ministry led by the personal opinions of the politician in charged, as opposed to the expert scientists it consults.</p> <p>Bovine tuberculosis is clearly a harrowing disease for all concerned, but pushing forward with a policy, when so much of the supporting evidence seems weak, tangential and/or cherry-picked, appears ill-advised.</p> <p>My colleague Damian Carrington <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/badger-cull-science-cows-tuberculosis?commentpage=all#block-507ea9e5c0e361310bc6d0be\">summed it up very well</a>: \"No-one knows whether the 16% reduction in cattle infections will materialise: it's a big gamble.\"</p> <p>Indeed, I believe the stakes are too high - and the odds too unsettled - to risk seeing whether this badger cull works in its current form.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ed14458f91d7bbadac7bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:48:52.385Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/c.donnelly/\">Christl Donnelly</a>, professor of statistical epidemiology at the <a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/about/institutes/outbreaks/\">MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling</a> at Imperial College London's <a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research/researchthemes/infection/ide/\">Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology</a>, has just sent me her thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>The estimate of a 16% reduction over 9.5 years for a 150sq-km culling area is a calculation (<a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\">pdf</a>) based on RBCT estimates of the benefits observed inside culling areas (during and after culling) and the temporarily increased risks to cattle herds up to <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009090\">2km outside culling areas</a>. This net benefit can be increased as the cull area gets bigger (everything else being equal). For a 300 sq-km area it is roughly a 19% reduction.</li> <li>\"The RBCT provides the best scientific evidence available from which to predict the effects of a future culling policy. Informed expert opinion suggests that the more that a future culling policy deviates from the conditions of the RBCT - e.g. industry versus government led and/or culling methods (such as permitting controlled shooting of badgers in addition to cage-trapping), the more likely it is that the effects of that policy will differ, either positively or negatively, and with potential variability in outcome between areas.\u201d (<a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\">pdf</a>)</li> <li>There is no scientific basis for saying that the use of hard boundaries will make the reduction much bigger because the RBCT used such boundaries where available (see <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081109113737/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/isg/isgrep1.htm#A10\">paragraph 4.12</a>). The only exception would be if a considerable part of the boundary were sea (i.e. a peninsula).</li> <li>Several aspects of the proposed policy have been directly informed by Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) findings. For example, the requirement to have large (at least 150sq-km) culling areas, the requirement to have access to at least 70% of the total land area for culling, and the requirement for culling to be repeated annually.</li> <li>However, the proposal is for a different culling method. Controlled shooting of free-ranging badgers has not been tested. The shooting of badgers after they were trapped in cages (as used in the RBCT) is not being proposed, because it was deemed too expensive for the predicted benefits in terms of cattle incidence. A judgement is then required as to rather this proposed culling is likely to \u2018work\u2019 in the sense of removing at least 70% of badgers (the reduction achieved on average in the RBCT). The risk is that it removes relatively few badgers; then the worst case scenario is not just the loss of the risk reduction observed in the RBCT but the possibility of actually increasing the risk to local cattle herds (such as observed in reactively culled areas of the RBCT).</li> <li>\u00b7Judging whether a 70% reduction has been achieved is very challenging because badgers are <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7400/full/485582a.html\">so difficult to count</a>. A suggestion has been made to trap a number of badgers before the culling, mark them and then count the number of marked badgers which are killed in the subsequent cull. This is a possible approach. However the number of badgers marked will need to be big in order to get a precise estimate. For example, if 100 badgers were marked and 70 of the marked badgers were culled, then the confidence interval would be 60% to 79% with a central estimate of 70%. Whereas if only 50 badgers were marked and 35 of the marked badgers were culled, then the confidence interval would span from 55% to 82%. It is not know what proportion of badgers need to be removed in order to avoid an increased risk due to limited culling success.</li> </ul> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ec6cbc0e361310bc6d0d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:55:31.107Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/esi/people/mcdonald/\">Robbie McDonald</a>, professor of natural environment at the University of Exeter, has been tweeting links to some of the key academic studies related to badge culls/vaccination and bovine tuberculosis...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258564649031700481\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Heres modelling paper comparing vaccination culling and ring vaccination<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Badgers\">#Badgers</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/smc_london\">smc_london</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcpallab\">bbcpallab</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dpcarrington\">dpcarrington</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/PaNCBIfi\" title=\"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039250\">dx.plos.org/10.1371/journa\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Robbie McDonald (@RobbieAMcDonald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258564649031700481\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:46:30+00:00\">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258567053869469696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>and here is the main paper so far reporting vaccine performance in captive and wild <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23badgers\">#badgers</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/thWAoTYK\" title=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/content/long/278/1713/1913\">rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/content/lo\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Robbie McDonald (@RobbieAMcDonald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258567053869469696\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:56:04+00:00\">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258578604202536960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-in-reply-to=\"258574842822021120\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dpcarrington\">dpcarrington</a> heres the biosecurity paper <a href=\"http://t.co/5Hi4fmjP\" title=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028941\">plosone.org/article/info:d\u2026</a> When measures are in place theyre 100% effective.

Both NFU and Defra spokespeople have, at times, added to the confusion by giving the impression that there is a scientific efficacy purpose to the killing, which there is not.</p> <p>A group of veterinarians, including our executive director Mark Jones, recently wrote to DEFRA (<a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/badgers_VetLetter_AnimalWelfar_12Oct12.pdf\">pdf</a>) to express their concerns that the pilot culls will inevitably lead to badgers enduring significant suffering. This is due to the likelihood that many will be shot but not killed, fleeing underground where they will slowly and painfully bleed to death. With early cubs being born mid December, as the later pilot continues there is also every chance that newborn cubs will starve to death in their sett if their mother is shot. In the gloom, it will be almost impossible for anyone to differentiate between a male and female badger, let alone a pregnant or lactating one.</p> <p>This is important in answering the question - will the cull work? If one of the main purposes of the cull is to assess the \"humaneness\" of the exercise, then clearly there is every likelihood that it will not work. Humaneness will be assessed by retrieving the carcasses of badgers. This will be simple enough for those animals cleanly shot - their bodies will be above ground. But if many badgers are not cleanly shot, are mortally wounded but die underground, their bodies will never be found and won't therefore form part of the data analysis. That means that precisely those animals who will have suffered the most and for the longest, will be absent from the humaneness assessment and the results will therefore be highly questionable.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The society has also produced this video, featuring <a href=\"http://www.billoddie.com/\">Bill Oddie</a> among others...</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_55z1AgLM_c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_55z1AgLM_c?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ea9e5c0e361310bc6d0be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:11:01.865Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Opinion</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/damiancarrington\">Damian Carrington</a>, the Guardian's head of environment, has emailed me his opinion on the science behind the badger cull:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The science of the proposed badger cull is complex, but the government's position is clear. They have taken a political decision to extrapolate the data from the landmark decade-long study (the Randomised Badger Culling Trial, or RBCT) in the hope of mounting a badger cull that will curb TB. No-one knows whether the 16% reduction in cattle infections will materialise: it's a big gamble.</p> <p>The crux is that the culling proposed by the government is very different to that in the earlier \u00a350m RBCT. Free-running badgers will be shot, not trapped first, because it is cheaper. The killing period has risen from 12 days to 42 days. And farmers are doing the cull, not the government. All these factors are likely to increase the well-established perturbation effect - that fleeing badgers increase TB infection, not reduce it.</p> <p>The new cull areas are bigger and will attempt to make better use of \"hard boundaries\" such as motorways, in an attempt to reduce perturbation. These might increase the effectiveness of the cull. But there are other issues too: you have to kill most of the badgers to ensure a positive effect on TB, but knowledge on how many there are now is limited. Protests are near certain and if they stop culling early, that is known to be the worst of all outcomes.</p> <p>A striking fact is that even in the government's own impact assessment, its proposed cull will cost much more than doing nothing. That isn't an option of course, given the 26,000 cattle killed last year, the \u00a390m cost and the social costs, but the government claims it is doing all it can on the alternatives of better cattle controls and biosecurity. European Commission inspectors <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb?CMP=twt_gu\">disagree</a>, finding in September 2011 a catalogue of failures in controls and biosecurity, including missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection at farm, vehicle, market and slaughterhouse levels\". All these problems increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle. Furthermore, 50 years ago bovine TB was virtually eradicated in this country through control measures alone, which were subsequently relaxed, to catastrophic effect.</p> <p>Despite saying they are \"pursuing both cattle and badger vaccination as quickly as possible\", the coalition government cancelled five of the six badger vaccines trials shortly after taking office. The government says \"a&#xa0;consensus view of scientists is that culling badgers can reduce TB in cattle\", which is true but misleading. The consensus is that culling as carried out under the RBCT can reduce TB - no-one knows what the government's very different badger cull will achieve. So, as Defra's former chief scientist, Porf Bob Watson, said to me, it's a matter of judgment.</p> <p>The judgement of every scientist outside of government that I am aware of, including the 32 eminent scientists who called for the cull to be cancelled in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\">letter to the Observer</a>, is that this badger cull is a bad idea. The architect of the RBCT called the new cull \"mindless\". The man who ran the RBCT said it \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/15/badger-cull-government-accused\">could make TB a damn sight worse</a>\".</p> <p>So why is it going ahead? It's back to politics. Some may think it significant that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jun/25/badger-cull-high-court-challenge\">freedom of information requests</a> for communication between the government and the National Farmers' Union were rejected on the basis that they were \"internal communications\".</p> </blockquote>  <p>And Damian has also sent me an addendum in reaction to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/badger-cull-science-cows-tuberculosis#block-507ea67f58f91d7bbadac79f\">my earlier post</a> highlighting the two-page document Defra is citing as its evidence for the cull:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You are right to highlight to the two-page April 2011 document as the entire basis of the government's argument that science backs its cull. Yet those who ran the RBCT say the document does nothing of the sort. A key sentence is \"the more that a future culling policy deviates from the conditions of the RBCT, the more likely it is that the effects of that policy will differ\". As as I explained before, the two culls are very different.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:13:33.561Z\">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507eaa62c0e361310bc6d0bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:54:07.682Z\">1.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a video produced by the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\">National Trust</a> highlighting its badger vaccination programme at its <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton/\">Killerton estate</a> near Exeter in Devon.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYOOpGAVZaY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bYOOpGAVZaY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ea67f58f91d7bbadac79f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:37:57.522Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One thing in particular that is worth highlighting again from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefraGovUK/with_replies\">Defra's Twitter Q&amp;A</a> is the moment that its chief scientist and chief vet were asked to cite the scientific evidence behind their support of the cull.

I thought this bit was fascinating, given what we now know the reaction to be:</p> <blockquote> <p>In discussion the following points were made:-</p> <ul> <li>The decision will clearly be very political.</li> <li>Whatever is done, there should be monitoring of the implementation and measuring of the effect.</li> <li>If the decision is to allow culling, expectations will need to be managed; both because there is likely to be an unrealistic view that culling will make a difference in a short time-scale, and also because other, non-culled areas such as the leading edges/boundaries of the wider areas experiencing disease are likely to be unaffected by any potential cull.</li> <li>The decision and subsequent debate could cause potential reputational damage for Defra and its evidence work; there was a discussion about whether this would be the case and how this might be managed.</li> <li>Ministers will make the final decision, whilst the CSA\u2019s role is to unpack all the different scientific issues.</li> <li>Any decision needs to be open and transparent.</li> <li>There was debate around what would happen if the decision was to allow culling, but then things didn\u2019t improve quickly, or farmers opted out \u2013 what that would mean in terms of legal options. There would need to be robust and credible arrangements for monitoring and enforcement.</li> <li>In managing the communications of any decision, care should be taken to recognise the different arguments; acknowledging scientists have multiple voices, and the asymmetry of their views, but recognising that the Government ultimately has to make a decision.</li> <li>Once any decision is taken, it will be interesting on a social science level to see how farmers and other groups respond.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The National Archive webpage for that meeting also contains a much more detailed document (<a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111030114052/http://sac.defra.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SAC-11-05-Bovine-TB-report.pdf\">pdf</a>) setting out the expert's recommendations to Defra based on the best available scientific evidence at that time.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ea0e458f91d7bbadac79c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:14:16.516Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Defra's Twitter Q&amp;A</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Defra has now wrapped up its Twitter session with chief scientist Ian Boyd and chief vet Nigel Gibbens.

It seems to be sympathetic with the dilemma facing politicians wishing to be guided by the best available evidence:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In April 2011, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs convened a panel of scientists to review the evidence and advise on whether a cull could work. The scientists, including several who now actively oppose the government\u2019s policy, gave a qualified \u2018yes\u2019. Culling could reduce bovine TB by perhaps 16% over 9 years, the scientists said, but it would be difficult to know if free shooting would work because it differed from the method tested in the previous trial.</p> <p>Partly on the basis of that analysis, the government seems to think that it\u2019s worth a shot. In combination with other techniques, such as increased monitoring and controls on cattle movements, it hopes that the badger cull can bring bovine TB under control. The politicians accept the modest reduction that scientists say the cull may bring, and have adopted scientific recommendations for how best to implement it, such as using rivers and roads as boundaries for their cull areas and setting a 70% target for the number of badgers killed (although knowing when this target has been reached will be difficult, because there has been no census of badger populations).</p> <p>Scientists protest that this decision is still unscientific, because the methods to be used are too different from those of the original trial and because the evidence suggests that they may not work. There is a chance that the cull will have little impact or could even increase the TB rate if improperly conducted.</p> <p>But it is the government\u2019s job to create and implement policy, not to perform science experiments. Politicians must make decisions every day with imperfect knowledge, knowing that many of those choices may turn out to be ineffective. In this case, they feel a need to do something to bring bovine TB under control \u2014 or at least to be seen to be trying to do so. They also face considerable pressure from unhappy farmers who are being told to implement costly biosecurity measures while badgers run free.</p> <p>Politicians all too frequently ignore scientific evidence, or worse still, distort it for their own purposes. The political debates over genetically modified food in Europe and climate change in the United States in recent years hold many examples of such behaviour. The badger issue is more nuanced. Politicians have understood the evidence, have acknowledged this evidence publicly and have made a policy that partially reflects it. Scientists have every right to disagree with the conclusion, but they should reconsider their criticisms of how it was reached.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It has also published an <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/badger-battle-erupts-in-england-1.11595\">accompanying article</a> which sets out an overview of the scientific investigations - and debate - into the linkages between badgers and bovine tuberculosis.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e825f58f91d7bbadac77d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:09:54.794Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/badgers-and-bovineTB\">Wildlife Trusts</a> has also sent over its position on the badger cull. It sees vaccinations as the better way forward:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our involvement with this issue over a long period of time has led us to the conclusion that a sustained programme of vaccination, alongside improved biosecurity measures, improved testing and controls on cattle movement would be the best means of tackling bTB.</p> <p>Recent, large badger culling trials have demonstrated projected efficiency in reducing bTB in cattle of just 12-16% (depending on the model) over nine years, leaving at least 84% of the problem. The Wildlife Trusts believe that culling badgers will also make the bovine TB problem worse by dispersing infected badger populations through the perturbation effect.</p> <p>Since 1998, the Government has invested \u00a330 million in developing TB vaccines for cattle and badgers. Applicants to Natural England for a license to cull badgers are asked to consider badger vaccination as part of their proposals. However, there is no clear badger vaccine strategy for England.</p> <p>In the long term it is clear that a vaccine for cattle could play a part in the solution. EU regulations currently prevent one from being deployed in this country, but the vaccine is available and being tested abroad. While the blockages to the cattle vaccine are resolved, there are immediate solutions available that do not involve culling. Improved biosecurity and cattle controls can reduce the risk of infection and transmission. A badger vaccine is available now and The Wildlife Trusts are leading the way on its deployment. Last year Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust became the first NGO to use it, 11 Wildlife Trusts are now working on such programmes, as are other organisations.</p> <p>The Wildlife Trusts are concerned that the current approach to vaccination is piecemeal. Many landowners interested in deploying the badger vaccine have approached their local Wildlife Trust for advice, as the information is not available centrally.</p> <p>We urge the Government to develop a clear strategy for the deployment of badger vaccination to help increase private deployment of the vaccine. A more coordinated approach to badger vaccination would help to increase use of the vaccine by allowing information to be shared more effectively and could also help to reduce to reduce costs to landowners.</p> <p>It is in nobody\u2019s interest to continue with the controlled shooting policy. The Wildlife Trusts\u2019 President Simon King has urged David Cameron to withdraw the controlled shooting licences, help farmers with improved biosecurity, commit to a badger vaccination strategy and push for changes to allow the cattle vaccine. Only then will we be able to get on top of this disease in an effective way.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It has also produced this video of Dr Gordon McGlone, chief executive of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, explaining how its own badger vaccination programme has fared:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edwRBOfopOM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/edwRBOfopOM?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e806258f91d7bbadac77c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:54:47.904Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A spokeswoman at the <a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/campaigns/wildlife/badgers/-/article/Pol_BadgersIntroduction\">RSPCA</a>, which supports in the \"<a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/campaigns/wildlife/stop-the-cull\">Stop the Badger Cull</a>\" campaign, has sent me this reaction:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The RSPCA's campaign against the badger cull is science and ethics-based. Thousands of badgers will be killed, many of them healthy, and yet the science showing a cull will be little help to controlling TB in cattle. In fact the best scientific evidence indicates that a cull could actually make things worse rather than better in some areas through a process called perturbation.</p> <p>We believe that the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB (ISG), which published its final report in 2007, provides the most robust scientific evidence to date. It was the result of painstaking research over nearly ten years, cost the lives of about 11,000 badgers and cost taxpayers \u00a350 million. It concluded that killing badgers could actually increase the spread of bTB in the area around the cull, making matters worse rather than better \u2013 a process called perturbation. It said, \u201cbadger culling can make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Although subsequent monitoring of cattle TB levels in the cull areas has shown some ongoing reduction the decrease is still very modest. Over nine years the average reduction has only been about 16%.</p> <p>The RSPCA is deeply sympathetic to farmers struggling to cope with the economic and emotional effects of this disease and agrees that action is needed to combat it \u2013 but does not think action is synonymous with culling.</p> <p>Only a tiny minority of cattle who are killed upon a reaction to the bTB test show any clinical signs of the disease and do not suffer as a result of bTB. In reality vastly more dairy cattle in the UK suffer significant pain and discomfort from lameness and mastitis every year, with large numbers also being culled as a result of these common conditions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e7991c0e361310bc6d095\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:32:39.933Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com\">National Farmers Union</a> (NFU) has issued a statement by its president Peter Kendal in response to the news that there will be a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/16/badger-cull-commons-debate\">parliamentary debate</a> about the badger cull on 25 October following the successful e-petition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The NFU will listen with interest as the MPs debate this extremely important and complex issue; one which causes misery to farming families in areas where levels of this disease are persistent and high. We hope it gives everyone opportunity to dispel any myths and misunderstanding surrounding TB, explain the science that backs up the government policy and the need to include badgers as part of the solution to ridding our countryside, both for cattle and for badgers, of bovine TB.</p> <p>The NFU supports this science-led government policy because TB is getting worse not better. 34,000 cattle were culled in Great Britain last year alone because they reacted to a TB test. No cattle vaccine is available, and one with the ability to provide near whole herd immunity is years away. Badger vaccine is being used and will continue to be used as part of the package of measures in this policy to try and halt the spread of TB.

  "<p>Candy Crowley, the moderator at Tuesday night's presidential debate, is coming under intense criticism from Romney supporters for the way she intervened in the rowdy dispute between the two presidential candidates over Libya.</p> <p>Conservative commentators responded with fury to what they believed was inappropriate meddling at a crucial moment in the town hall debate. The prominent rightwing pundit Charles Krauthammer accused Crowley of having \"contaminated\" the discussion by apparently incorrectly supporting Obama in his account of events over the attack on the US embassy in Benghazi in which the American ambassador died.</p> <p>Michelle Malkin, a conservative blogger, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michellemalkin/status/258403793153179648\">tweeted that the moderator was wrong</a> to have backed an \"Obama lie\" over Libya. The most lurid complaint came from John Nolte, writing on the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/16/Crowley-Saves-Obama-with-false-fact-check\">rightist aggregation site Breitbart.com</a>, who charged Crowley not only with jumping into the debate to take Obama's side but also of steering the entire debate in such a way as to make it \"a total and complete setup to rehabilitate Barack Obama\".</p> <p>As the criticism of Crowley mounted, liberal commentators leapt to her defence, sending the hashtag #gocandy trending on Twitter. Hilary Rosen, a Democratic voice on Crowley's channel CNN, counter-punched that \"Romney is trying to bully Candy Crowley. He looks rude.\"</p> <p>Bill Maher, comedian and acerbic TV host, lamented that the moderator was being pummelled by Romney and Obama. \"Both of them are trying to roll over Candy Crowley. And that can't be easy.\"</p> <p>The spat over Benghazi came at a key stage in the presidential showdown. Obama, emboldened by his feisty performance thus far, and Romney, rising to the challenge, were by that point unrestrained in their attacks on one another.</p> <p>When the matter of the Benghazi assault came up, as Crowley said afterwards that she had expected it to, Romney launched into his by now familiar criticism of the Obama administration over the events in Libya. He said that it had misled the American people in the days after the attack by presenting it as a spontaneous eruption from a demonstration rather than a planned terrorist act.</p> <p>\"It took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror,\" Romney claimed.</p> <p>Obama riposted fiercely by saying that on 12 September, the day after the attack, he had addressed the nation from the Rose Garden of the White House. \"I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people \u2026 that this was an act of terror.\"</p> <p>When Romney doubted his recollection of events, Obama said: \"Get the transcript.\" </p> <p>It was at that moment that <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-usa-campaign-crowley-idUSBRE89G09I20121017\">Crowley stepped gamely</a> \u2013 fatefully, some might say \u2013 into the ring. On the morning after the event she admitted that she had surprised herself by speaking out, saying it was the \"natural thing that came out of me\".</p> <p>\"He did in fact, sir. So let me \u2013 let me call it an act of terror \u2026,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?\" Obama chimed in.</p> <p>\"He did call it an act of terror,\" she duly supplied, though, sensing perhaps that she had strayed into a very hostile place, she added that Romney was also correct in that the administration had taken two weeks or so to get the whole picture of the assault out.</p> <p>The truth of the matter, as is so often the case in these pressurised televised events, was more nuanced than either side suggested. Crowley did not, as conservatives are now chanting, make a naked error that displayed her political bias towards Obama. But nor did she get it entirely right.</p> <p>In his Rose Garden speech <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/12/transcript-president-obama-remarks-following-deadly-attacks-at-us-consulate-in/\">Obama did use the phrase</a> \"acts of terror\", but he did so in the plural and within a general discourse on the threats facing the US rather than as a specific reference to Benghazi.</p> <p>Having become the story, an uncomfortable place for any journalist, Crowley may console herself with the knowledge that presidential moderators are damned when they do, damned when they don't. The moderator of the first debate on 3 October, Jim Lehrer of PBS, was pounded for having been too passive \u2013 quite the opposite of the response to Crowley's perceived interventionism.</p> <p>At one point Crowley alluded to the bind she was in. As both the candidates went at each other, fingers jabbing, ignoring her appeals to stay on question, she said: \"I understand the stakes here. I understand both of you. But I will get run out of town if I don't allow\u2026 \"</p> <p>She never got to finish the sentence: the candidates had drowned her out.</p>",

But the Obama they wanted to see \u2013 aggressive, quick to paint Romney as a re-run of the worst of the Bush years, flashes of indignant fury that his administration's credibility is being questioned \u2013 may or may not be who those few remaining undecided voters wanted to see. Obama's performance Tuesday night will do wonders for Democratic morale, but we may not see much shift in the tracking poll numbers.</p> <p>CNN's coverage offers a fascinating live response from undecided voters: judging from the twin lines on the bottom of the screen (one for men, the other for women) both candidates did pretty well and voters didn't like it when either man attacked the other. Of course, candidates in races at all levels wouldn't use negative attacks if they didn't work; one wonders if the diving lines indicated the respondents genuinely didn't like the attacks, or whether they've just been conditioned to know they're <em>supposed</em> to express disapproval of them.</p> <p>The snap polls, too, pointed to an Obama win in the marginal-to-modest range: in CBS News' instant poll, 37% said Obama won the debate, 30% said Romney, and 33% said it was a tie. Interestingly, 65% said Romney won on the issue of economy, compared to 34% who said Obama. In CNN's poll of registered voters who watched the debate, 46% said Obama won the debate, 39% said Romney won the debate.</p> <p>Those results indicate it wasn't a bad night for Mitt Romney, and there was little chance he would equal the drubbing he dealt the president in the first debate. But a little more than an hour into the debate, he completely mishandled one of the most potent issues \u2013 how the administration characterized the attack on our diplomats in Benghazi, Libya. He seemed to know it, as his energy slid for the remainder of the debate.</p> <p>Between the questioners at the debate and Frank Luntz's focus group on Fox News, one of the lessons of the night is that very few people who claim to be undecided are genuinely undecided. The early questioner who mentioned that Energy Secretary Steven Chu has said that the overall goal of the nation's energy policy is not to bring down the prices of gas \u2013 no chance he's genuinely undecided. (<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/10/09/dems_don_t_want_lower_gas_prices\">Conservative radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh talked about the issue</a> and mentioned Chu last week.) One woman who asked the candidates about unequal pay for women \u2013 an easy lay-up for Obama to mention the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The majority of Luntz's focus group of allegedly undecided voters loathed Obama's performance, and during a furious denunciation of Obama's presidency, one panelist let slip the term \"bullshitting\" on the air. Are we to believe that guy really doesn't know who he's going to vote for in November?</p> <p>The \"town hall\" debate format has been around for 20 years, and it may be time to consider retiring it at the presidential level. The questioners tend to freeze under the lights; almost all of the queries are variations of \"what can you do for me?\"; the candidates have been conditioned to repeat the questioner's name and emote sympathy&#xa0; to the point of overacting; and way too much attention is paid to the candidates' body language as they get up and down off those high stools.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review and writes the Campaign Spot blog</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Romney's reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, that was unexpected.</p> <p>Going into last night's second presidential debate I fully expected Barack Obama to do better than he did in the first debate in Denver. But what was so surprising was not just how good Obama was (and he was quite good), but how bad Mitt Romney was.</p> <p>It all started with the first question, posed by an undecided college student concerned about his job prospects after graduation. It was a softball, one that a candidate with an even the modicum of an economic plan could knock out of the park.</p> <p>And Romney whiffed on it \u2013 serving up meaningless platitudes like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There was not a single policy offered to support Romney's confidence. For a candidate whose entire candidacy is premised on the notion that he will fix the economy and create jobs, it was a glaring moment. It was like this the entire evening: Romney's lack of specificity and his reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling.</p> <p>For example, when asked how he would ensure women received equal pay in the workforce, Romney bragged about hiring women for his administration when he was governor of Massachusetts. It was an answer that reeked of tokenism. On taxes, he continued to offer vagueness about how he'll pay for his 20% across-the-board tax cut. And bizarrely, he cued up Obama to reference his 47% comment by saying he wanted to be president of 100% of Americans. It was like he handed the president the piece of two-by-four with which to hit him.</p> <p>But his worst moment came during a question on Libya when Romney claimed that the president had never called the recent assassination of the US ambassador in Benghazi \"act of terror\". Obama had, in fact, done just that \u2013 a point that moderator, Candy Crowley pointed out, embarrassingly for Romney. But what I found most striking about that particular exchange was what came right before \u2013 President Obama's initial response to Romney:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.</p> <p>\"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as commander-in-chief.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was a very different Obama than the one we saw in Denver \u2013 focused, passionate (but not strident), aggressive (but not obnoxious). On virtually every answer, Obama did exactly what he didn't do in Denver: he defended his record and then opened up a tough line of attack against his opponent. There was nothing more important for Obama to do last night than offer voters a clear contrast between the two candidates. On nearly every question, Obama did just that.</p> <p>It was a strong performance from a candidate whose back was against the wall; but it was one that's effectiveness was matched only by the failure of his opponent.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Guardian and Observer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a>: 'The highlight was Obama's full-throated defense of reproductive rights'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There were flashier moments in the debate \u2013 the Libya fact-check, the oil permits body-space infringement \u2013 but, for me, the highlight of the debate was President Obama's full-throated defense of the idea that reproductive rights \"are not just women's issues, these are family issues, they are economic issues.\" Up until now, even the Obama campaign has been leaning on the \"war on women\" meme as something that is somehow separate from the economy, that \"social issues\" are a kind of marginal voter-persuasion issue \u2013 on par with \"who you would rather have a beer with?\"</p> <p>I've argued before that almost every so-called social issue is wrapped up in economics (marriage equality and social stability help communities thrive, for instance), but contraception has been essential to women's <em>economic</em> equality for, well, probably ever.

The president was much more willing to challenge Mitt Romney on his facts, on his record, and on his career in business.</p> <p>We heard about Bain, the 47%, and outsourcing of US jobs to China. Obama even unfavorably compared Romney to George W Bush, the president responsible for the next highest spending binge.</p> <p>But Romney remained spirited as well. He did not simply allow Candy Crowley to steamroll him and give the president favorable treatment. He contested Obama's most politically damaging claims.</p> <p>Romney was particularly effective in advertising the undeniable distance between the president's 2008 campaign promises and the rather less impressive 2012 record. Obama still was shy on details of what he would do in a second term, aside from continuing to present mediocrity as better than what a Republican would do in office.</p> <p>Yet the most disastrous exchange for Romney concerned Libya, where he concerned himself more with talking points and chest-beating than actual problems with Obama's interventionist approach. Indeed, Obama undermined Romney by unequivocally claiming full responsibility, rather than blaming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>If that is any indication of how the third and final debate, focusing on foreign policy, will go, then Romney \u2013 the candidate who has appeared to commit himself to arming Syrian rebels, a more hawkish stance toward Iran, and disapproving of the the largely Iraqi-mandate withdrawal from Iraq\u2013 is in serious trouble.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Obama was testy, whiny, overly aggressive'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The question leading up to the second debate between Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama was \"which Obama will show up tonight?\"</p> <p>The abysmal performance by Obama in the first debate was not something the president's supporters wanted to see repeated. Mitt Romney needed to match his performance from the first debate. Barack Obama needed to do significantly better than he did in the first debate.</p> <p>Both men achieved those objectives. Romney reminded voters of the poor Obama record of these past four years, and was armed with facts, while Obama claimed Romney was not telling the truth, yet did not seem equipped to articulate just where Romney was incorrect.</p> <p>While Obama at least seemed present and possessing a pulse in the second debate, he was testy, whiny, overly aggressive, and even asked for \u2013 and received \u2013 a highly inappropriate level of help and support from the debate moderator. Mitt Romney was presidential, just as he was in the first debate. He had command of the facts, but was repeatedly interrupted by Obama and the moderator.</p> <p>Obama claimed Mitt Romney was untruthful, but could not be not specific. However, Romney clearly and correctly stated that President Obama was, indeed, untruthful in his claims that federal oil production was up. Obama denied it, and the moderator did not step in to call him on it.</p> <p>Obama (and the moderator) also claimed he called the 11 September assassination attack in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans a \"terrorist attack\" the following day in a Rose Garden speech. The transcript does not reveal that specifically, but in the days that followed, President Obama on numerous occasions claimed the attack was due to a video that was deemed insulting to Islam. He has since backed away from those comments and is now denying he made them, as part of his ever-shifting statements on Benghazi. The debate moderator let him get away with that one, too.</p> <p>While Obama likely succeeded in helping to clean up the mess he'd made with his disappointed base, Mitt Romney did not lose anything, and maintains the momentum from the first debate.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nancy-goldstein\">Nancy Goldstein</a>: 'The relaxed, engaging Professor Obama connected the dots'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925064\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/6/8/1307540115667/nancygoldstein_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Goldstein\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mitt Romney isn't entirely to blame for last night's resurgence by Barack Obama. OK, so he was callow and creepy, but no more than usual (it's hard to shake the feeling that both he and Ryan were assembled in a basement). The bottom line is that Obama had a Big Night, one where he hit all his shots.</p> <p>Gone was the dour and pedantic grumpster that sleepwalked through debate one. When a young woman asked how his administration intends to address inequalities in the workplace, particularly around pay, it was the relaxed, engaging Professor Obama who connected the dots, moving easily from mentioning the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act his administration passed in 2009, to making the case that equal pay for equal work has moved from being a \"women's\" or \"family\" issue, to become a key issue for the middle class, period.</p> <p>Romney, who punted when asked earlier this year whether he supported the Ledbetter Act, could only squirm. Worse yet, his longwinded non-response was: a) a <a href=\"http://elections.americablog.com/2012/10/romneys-binder-full-of-women-story-was-a-lie.html\">lie</a>, and b) included the \"whole binders full of women\" comment that has, at last count, inspired over a dozen social media equivalents of cover bands including Tumblr accounts, Facebook pages,websites, and several Twitter feeds, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romneys_Binder\">Romneys_Binder</a> leading the pack at 14,000+ followers.</p> <p>Like all great competitors, last night's Obama read the opposition well and created his own shot. While Romney tried to recover his Just for Men cool after flubbing the Ledbetter question, the president linked women's success in the workplace to healthcare; healthcare to contraception; and contraception (as well as mammograms and screenings for cervical cancer) to Planned Parenthood, which he supports and Romney actively wants to defund. Obama reminded his audience that while his healthcare plan mandates free contraception as part of standard insurance, Romney supports <a href=\"http://www.blogforchoice.com/archives/2012/03/romney-bosses-s.html\">repealing that provision through the Blunt amendment</a>.</p> <p>Obama's move was the debate equivalent of driving past an opponent to the basket, then dunking on him.

  "<p>Before kick-off in Serbia's World Cup qualifier against Belgium in Belgrade on Friday, three journalists independently told me, with great pride, how promising Serbia's Under-21 side was. The senior side showed potential, the general view went, but in four years or so it would once again be a force to be reckoned with. Two hours later, the limitations of the present senior team had been exposed in a 3-0 defeat while the Under-21s had lost 1-0 to England.</p> <p>Three days later and Serbian football was once again in disgrace, the senior side beset by internal bickering and the Under-21s' play-off having ended in a brawl as fans hurled missiles on to the pitch and engaged in monkey chants. Even more serious are the allegations of racial abuse against various players. There is frustration and there is anger, but most of all there is despair.</p> <p>For English football, the disgrace called to mind two previous incidents \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/oct/19/championsleague.sport1?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Sinisa Mihajlovic's racial abuse of Patrick Vieira in a Champions League game</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/19/newsstory.sport3?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">chanting directed by Serbian fans at black English players during the European Under-21 championship in Nijmegen in 2007</a>. Mihajlovic, now the national team manager, admitted the offence, apologised publicly and accepted his three-game ban, but asked why Vieira hadn't even been investigated. Mihajlovic insisted he had called Vieira \"a black shit\" only because Vieira had called him \"a gypsy shit\": there was a sense of double standards at work.</p> <p>The Serbian football federation, meanwhile, responded to the 2007 incident by pointing out it had no control over fans in the Netherlands. The game hadn't happened in its stadium, it hadn't sold the tickets and the vast majority of Serbian fans in Nijmegen that night were emigrants living in the Netherlands or Germany.</p> <p>In both cases, there was a feeling that Serbia was being victimised, that the war and perceptions of what happened in the 1990s made it an easy target. This time, though, there is no excuse. This was an incident that happened in Krusevac and the tickets were sold by the Serbian federation. It has a clear responsibility for what happened: its stewards and its police should have dealt with the crowd trouble and if the allegations against its players are proven, it must take action against them.</p> <p>With Savo Milosevic, the match delegate, apologising to Stuart Pearce, it seems there is a recognition of the seriousness of the incident, something reflected in the Serbian press. \"It's no secret that foreign nationals are often biased against Serbia,\" said an opinion piece in the tabloid Blic. \"It's no secret that they think that Serbia continues in the stone age and that we're thugs, hooligans. It's no secret that the world is circulating the wrong image of Serbia and stereotypes attached to it. But how could it not when the world is being sent the wrong image?\"</p> <p>The problem then is what to do about it. Many in England have called for Serbia to be expelled from European competition. After the hooliganism that forced the abandonment of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/12/italy-serbia-called-off-crowd-trouble\" title=\"\">Italy v Serbia Euro 2012 qualifier in Genoa</a>, it's easy to understand why. The danger is that doing so pushes Serbian football further into fuck-you isolationism. The truth is that many in Serbian football are appalled by what has happened, about the self-destructiveness that seems to pervade their game at every level, but the statement released on Wednesday by the FSS fails to reflect that.</p> <p>\"The FA of Serbia absolutely refuses and denies that there were any occurrences of racism before and during the match at the stadium in Krusevac,\" it said. \"Making connection between the seen incident \u2013 a fight between members of the two teams \u2013 and racism has absolutely no ground and we consider it to be a total malevolence.\" The statement further accuses Danny Rose of having \"behaved in inappropriate, unsportsmanlike and vulgar manner towards the supporters on the stands\", an extraordinary stance that seems to prejudge the results of its promised investigation and offers little hope it will be either thorough or objective.</p> <p>The FSS is in a hugely difficult position. The trial in the Hague of the former Bosnian Serb leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/radovankaradzic\" title=\"\">Radovan Karadzic</a> for war crimes is a reminder of just how recently Serbia was involved in a horrendous war. Society there is still scarred by those memories; the issue of Kosovo remains unresolved.</p> <p>Hooliganism, corruption, organised crime and match-fixing haunt Serbian football and the FSS is largely impotent to combat them.</p> <p>Of course the FSS must take action. It must ban any Serbian player found guilty of racist abuse (four to eight games seems the standard penalty), it must make clear that racism is intolerable, it must investigate the crowd trouble and prosecute where appropriate. It must not be too proud to ask for help, but the wider world has to make clear it is willing to listen. A ban should be a last resort. The urge to punish is understandable but it must be the guilty who are punished.</p> <p>If the FSS refuses to act decisively, refuses to recognise the severity of the allegations, refuses to do what it can within its admitted limited power, it becomes complicit. And if that is the case, then a points deduction or a ban may be the only solution left.</p>",

The risk is much more difficult to assess. I believe that the risk is somewhat increased, and I don\u2019t want to exaggerate this, but somewhat increased by the absence of the ability readily to relocate a person, because the freedom of movement of a person enables them to move around the country and meet and communicate with a wider range of people. If somebody is a motivator of violent Islamists then their freedom to move around the country may allow them to motivate more than would otherwise be the case.</p> </blockquote> <p>Deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Osborne, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, told the same committee that control orders were a \u201cvery cost-effective way\u201d of dealing with terrorist suspects.

Ed Miliband also welcomed the figures, although with some reservations. \u201cI\u2019m sure we all agree there are too many people still looking for work, and the number of people out of work for a long period, over a year, still remains stubbornly high.\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Miliband has described Andrew Mitchell as \u201ctoast\u201d, claiming that his position is untenable.</strong> The Labour leader said that any young person who abused the police in the way the chief whip did would be arrested.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While it is a night in the cell for the yobs, it is a night at the Carlton Club for the chief whip.

His position is untenable. In other words, he is toast and that is the reality.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron said that what Mitchell did and said was wrong, but that he had apologised and that his apology had been accepted. He criticised Miliband for raising the subject. \u201c[Miliband] doesn\u2019t want to talk about what we need to do in this country to get our deficit down, because he has got no policies,\u201d Cameron said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has announced that the government will legislate to force energy companies to offer the lowest tariff to their customers.</strong> \u201cI can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers,\u201d he said at PMQs. This goes further than Labour, which has said that it would force energy customers to offer the lowest tariffs to the over-75s, although Labour has also called for Ofgem to be replaced with a more powerful regulator that would force prices down. As my colleagues Damian Carrington and Juliette Jowit report, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/energy-policy-coalition-green-agenda\">later today Cameron and other ministers will be holding a summit on energy policy.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street has said that Cameron was \u201cappalled\u201d by the racist abuse directed at England players during the Under-21 team\u2019s match against Serbia last night.</strong> A Number 10 spokesman said: \u201cHe was appalled by the scenes that we have seen in Serbia. We are determined to stamp out racism internationally and at home and we are giving our full backing to the FA\u2019s complaint on this issue. Clearly it is for Uefa to investigate this issue but we would expect tough sanctions. If we are going to stamp out racism from football, then it is no good giving derisory fines, as have been handed out in the past. It is not good enough to say that people should shake hands and forget about it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Teaching unions have reacted angrily to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/17/michael-gove-baccalaureate-a-levels\">a report in the Times saying that Michael Gove plans to overhaul A-levels</a>.</strong> Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \u201cThis is another example of Michael Gove\u2019s ideological manipulation of the school curriculum. These changes are being made on the basis of his own personal prejudices rather than developing a curriculum which is fit for children and young people in the 21st century.\u201d And Nansi Ellis, head of education policy and research, at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that the secretary of state is considering the future of assessment for young people. However, he shows contempt for teachers, pupils and parents by once again discussing this with journalists before talking to those who will be affected by it, or those with the expertise to ensure a changed system works.

I'm afraid I missed it, because it came as I was writing up the end of the Cameron/Miliband exchanges, but others seem to have missed it too. Luckily it did not get through the Press Association net. Here is what it has filed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron announced today that energy firms will be forced to give customers the cheapest available tariff under new legislation. <br>Amid mounting concern about rocketing fuel bills, the prime minister signalled plans to introduce new laws to tackle the often-confusing array of tariffs. <br>\"I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers,\" he told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions. <br>His intervention follows a string of above-inflation price hikes by major energy companies in recent days.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ed Miliband said that Labour would force energy companies to offer the lowest tariffs to over-75s, but Cameron seems to be going further. </p> <p>I'll post more on this later.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e9c7558f91d7bbadac79b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:54:29.682Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>PMQs Verdict:</strong> David Cameron has said that Andrew Mitchell's behaviour was indefensible and - not surprisingly - he found it impossible to defend at PMQs. That's why Ed Miliband had the upper hand. The BBC has just pointed out that he slipped in his final question, saying that people were losing their jobs (when unemployment is going down - although technically there will still be some people losing their jobs), but that does not matter particularly, because his best soundbite (the double standards one, about the Carlton Club and a night in the cells) quite easily trumps Cameron's best soundbite (a lame one about Labour not having anything to say on the economy).</p> <p>That said, the exchanges were not that damaging to Cameron, and there was nothing in what he said, or in the way Tory MPs reacted, to suggest that Mitchell will have to resign. If anything, judging from the immediate reaction, he may well have passed the moment of most danger.</p> <p>(A conspiracy theorist might point out that this is exactly what Milband wants. Strategically, it is far more useful to Labour to have Mitchell in the cabinet, as a long-term reminder of Tory attitudes to public sector workers, than it would be to have Mitchell resign this week. But does that mean Miliband was somehow \"holding back\"? I doubt it. At PMQs it is hard to calibrate your performance with that degree of precision.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e98c358f91d7bbadac799\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:38:43.377Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cameron says recent figures from the IMF show that there was a 5% structural deficit in 2007.

But frankly, when the welfare bill is spiralling by over \u00a324 billion over this parliament, ministers are wrong to be breaking out the bunting. <br>There are now red flashing lights warning that Britain is becoming a very divided country. <br>Long-term unemployment has risen yet again. The number of young people out of work and claiming benefits for more than a year went up yet again, and three-quarters of Britain has higher unemployment than at the election. More than a third of people out of work have been jobless for more than a year in the clearest sign yet that the Work programme is not doing the job. <br>People in jobs are increasingly having to work part-time or on temporary contracts. There are 1.4 million people who are forced to work part time because they cannot find a full time job. <br>I\u2019m afraid the story is very simple. Those out of jobs are increasingly shut out. Those in jobs are increasingly insecure.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Brendan Barber</strong>, the TUC general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These may be the best figures for some time, but we still need to do much, much better. There are still hundreds of thousands of young people without work, over a million people working part-time who want full time-jobs, and wages are still trailing below inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>David Kern</strong>, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest job market figures are encouraging and support our assessment that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The level of employment is at a record high, and the fall in the level of inactivity is a positive development, signalling that people are returning to the workforce.</p> <p>The strong trend in the labour market raises questions about the accuracy of GDP figures, which are still showing three consecutive declines over the period to the second quarter of 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That there is mass unemployment, in the sixth year of recession, shows that the Tories and Liberals are following the wrong economic policies.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Dave Prentis</strong>, the Unison general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any fall in unemployment has to be welcome, but there is no room for complacency around these figures. There are still 2.53 million people out of work and a near-record 1.4 million people who are being forced into part-time work when they need the income from a full-time job.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hidden behind the statistics is the stubborn underlying problem of the long-term unemployed, whether it is the 16-to-24 year olds or other groups seeking work. It is those areas that ministers need to concentrate on as a matter of urgency.<br>&#xa0;<br>The economy overall is flatlining, household incomes are being squeezed and demand has been sucked out of the economy.<br>&#xa0;<br>The UK is still in recession, so there is nothing for the government to crow about.</p> <p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reports that up to 66 people are chasing every retail job and last week when car giant, JLR offered 1,200 jobs, 20,000 people went for them \u2013 this means that there is hardly a jobs\u2019 Eldorado out there.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Chris Goulden</strong> from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While any fall in unemployment is welcome, the main problem for&#xa0;young people looking for work is fundamental \u2013 a major shortage of jobs. We need to ratchet up the quality of supply and demand together in order to have any impact on poverty.</p> <p>Today\u2019s unemployment figures show that 957,000 16\u201324 year olds are unemployed (not including those in full-time education). Despite fluctuations, this remains a long-term high, although \u2013 as cannot be repeated enough \u2013 the upward trend started long before the current recession, as far back as 2004.</p> <p>To get a job in these conditions, young people have to apply quickly and consistently to stand any chance. Even if they do hear back, then chances are that the job will be poorly paid and non-standard hours.</p> <p>Our research, <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/disadvantaged-young-people-work\">published today</a>, shows looking for work for young people is a job in itself. It\u2019s time to increase skills and the number of decent jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Tony Dolphin</strong>, chief economist at the IPPR</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s figures are good news. They show further welcome falls in unemployment, which is good news especially for young people. There has clearly been an Olympic effect. Almost half of the rise in employment across England has been in London and a quarter of new jobs are temporary.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Matthew Oakley</strong>, head of economics and social policy at the Policy Exchange thinktank</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are an encouraging set of figures that emphasise the flexibility of the UK labour market. But we mustn\u2019t be complacent. Most of these new jobs are part-time or temporary and there is still an underlying problem that many people leaving jobseeker's allowance end up back on the dole within a year. To tackle this we must ensure that people moving off JSA think about increasing their hours, taking on more work and considering future jobs. Currently just one in ten part-time workers is looking for another job.</p> <p>Providing better support to claimants by reforming the way jobcentres are incentivised to get people into full time work is vital. So is the need to increase conditions on people - including those in part time and temporary work \u2013 to do all they possibly can to find full time employment and move off benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Walker</strong>, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is good news that unemployment continues to fall, but the number of people that have been out of work for more than a year is growing. More than 45,000 new jobs could be created if the government were to extend the National Insurance contributions holiday and this would go a long way to helping those people find work.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Andrew Sissons</strong>, a researcher at The Work Foundation, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strong job growth seen over the last year is finally beginning to translate into falling unemployment, especially among young people. While a drop in unemployment of 50,000 is relatively modest, the direction of travel is all important. If the economy keeps creating jobs at its current rate, we should begin to see more substantial falls in unemployment, potentially bringing it back under 2.5 million in the coming months.</p> <p>&#xa0;It is particularly encouraging to see youth unemployment falling, with an extra 50,000 young people moving into work, bringing the total back under one million. This suggests that the strength of the labour market is finally beginning to benefit younger workers. However, unemployment and inactivity among young people remains dangerously high, and more work is needed to sustain this trend.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:24:05.146Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507e7e7cc0e361310bc6d098\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:46:36.941Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today's Guardian politics stories <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/all\">here</a>.

So far, much of the party seems unaware of what\u2019s coming. Blairites, who mistakenly took the leader\u2019s conference speech as a shift to the centre, and Old Labourites, who wrongly detected a swerve to the Left, heard only what they wished to hear ...</p> <p>On welfare, the logic of one nationism would seem to favour a contributory system in which those who pay their dues get the most back. The very fairness of such measures would, some argue, engender compassion. As others protest that such a change would imperil the poorest, a row simmers within the party. On crime, the common good is unlikely to be best served by a Tory crackdown that will drain the public purse, hamper rehabilitation and so make citizens less safe. Will Mr Miliband dare say so?</p> <p>On the clearest part of his prospectus \u2013 muscling in on the conservatism abandoned by the Tories \u2013 Mr Miliband will promise, like a one-man Unesco, to preserve Britain\u2019s heritage and institutions. The danger is that pledges to conserve the NHS may backfire once it becomes clear that destruction, including hospital closures, is the only realistic route to salvation.</p> <p>The sole certainty is that Labour has not got the leader it expected. Blairites wanted a continuity regime, the Left expected reassurance, and the unions hoped for a poodle. All those comfort zones will be vaporised in the white heat of Mr Miliband\u2019s one-nation furnace. Quite what will emerge from the fireball is unclear, but there is no doubting the scope of his ambition.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/10/eds-going-to-tough-with-the-party-how-exactly/\">Mark Ferguson has responded with a post at LabourList, saying that he is sceptical about whether Miliband\u2019s proposals really will upset his party as much as Riddell suggests.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3570338.ece\">\u2022 Alastair Campbell in the Times says politicians must understand the power of social media.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The speed of change is breathtaking. Facebook, founded in 2004, recently recorded its one billionth devotee. YouTube, created in 2005, now has more videos uploaded in one month than three US TV networks created in 60 years.

The number of British people on Twitter \u2014 10 million \u2014 has overtaken the number buying a daily newspaper ...</p> <p>In an era when people believe politicians and journalists less than they used to, they still believe each other.

Liberal democracies can only exist with informed citizens. This is an axiom but one that requires repetition. And despite the role that a vibrant, rigorous and even feisty media plays in building bigger, stronger societies and deeper, surer liberty, we still see attacks on free speech and press freedoms all around the world.</p> <p>In Britain we are entering a new age where, rather than Whitehall disguising and denying as much as it can, we are pushing out information and inviting the media to hold us to account. Right across the world, the transparency agenda will see journalists as well as citizens gaining access to unprecedented amounts of data. The media has a unique role. Journalists need to engage with this data to expose waste, incompetence and corruption wherever they see it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m issuing a call to arms to the media the world over to hold the feet of government officials and ministers like me to the fire.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/loans/9613729/Loan-firms-wonga-buys-the-ears-of-ministers.html\">\u2022 Tim Ross and Rowena Mason in the Daily Telegraph say Conservative ministers agreed to hold meetings with Wonga in return for payments to the party.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The meetings took place at the Tory Party conference last week despite the new party chairman, Grant Shapps, previously describing the activities of some payday lenders as \u201cobscene\u201d.</p> <p>A Cabinet source privately admitted that \u201cmoneymaking\u201d was a key goal of this year\u2019s conference, with companies paying thousands for exhibition stands and events.

  "<p>The most notable thing about this series of The Thick of It is how alarmingly prescient it's been. First there was the storyline about a government proposal to cut school breakfast clubs, followed the next day by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/16/breakfast-clubs-schools-funding\" title=\"\">a real-life equivalent</a>. Then there was WeBank, a wildly expensive community bank launched in vain by coalition underdogs Fergus and Adam, which Vince Cable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2012/sep/24/we-bank-the-thick-of-it\" title=\"\">then launched at the Lib Dem party conference</a> two days later. All that's missing is an Auto-Tuned video of Peter Mannion <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/21/nick-clegg-apology-song-alex-ross\" title=\"\">singing an apology direct to camera</a> and The Thick of It would have a perfect record for predicting the future.</p> <p>It's nothing less than you'd expect from the show that coined the term \"omnishambles\". While Twenty Twelve might have had a similar run of luck predicting the Olympic committee's myriad snafus this year the show's good-natured doom-mongering was somewhat hobbled when the Olympics themselves turned out to be brilliant. With the Thick of It there's no such silver lining: it can confidently portray the worst-case scenario in every situation because we're all actually living it.</p> <p>With last Saturday's fifth episode, however, The Thick of It stopped inadvertently predicting the future and started to actively comment on the recent past. The structure of this series \u2013 one episode for the government, another for the opposition \u2013 was dropped to allow a frantic free-for-all scramble leading up to this week's Leveson-style inquiry: the one that Armando Iannucci has been promising us all along. There isn't a character on the entire show \u2013 barring perhaps slippery Dan Miller \u2013 who couldn't lose their career over the course of the next couple of episodes. Everyone has everything to play for. It has the potential to be very entertaining indeed.</p> <p>All of which will come as a relief to those who have been disappointed by this series of The Thick of It. And, in some ways, they've had a point. While the lines have been just as sharp as ever \u2013 especially \"I'm going for a Twix\" and \"Am I supply-side economics?\" which, when spoken by Roger Allam's Peter Mannion, come off as mini-masterpieces \u2013 some other aspects haven't been quite up to scratch.</p> <p>The first couple of episodes were a bit too low-key, the performances \u2013 in particular newcomer Geoffrey Streatfield as Fergus \u2013 have been slightly too broad and the lack of any Malcolm Tucker at all for two entire episodes has been almost too much to take. But now the series is taking shape, and if it keeps building momentum in the same way it has for the last few weeks, it looks set to go down as a vintage year.</p> <p>And if this really is to be the final series, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/02/the-thick-of-it-armando-iannucci-series-new-online-firms_n_1850137.html\" title=\"\">as reports have repeatedly suggested</a>, then these last few episodes have added an interesting new dimension to the entire show. Because taken as a whole, The Thick of It now looks very much like the tale of Dan Miller's rise to power. He has been there right from the start, lurking in the background emitting a vaguely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine\" title=\"\">Palpatine</a> presence, dipping in and out of the action when it suited him best.</p> <p>The third episode of the first series saw him steal a march on Hugh Abbott by strategically resigning, he was a destabilising force in the specials, he spent the last series building up a faction to rival the prime minister and now he's emerged as leader-in-waiting of the opposition. Presciently, in episode three of this series, Peter Mannion said: \"If Dan Miller gets in, we're all fucked.\" And now he is. Could Mannion's prediction come true? Slippery Miller has already taken out Nicola Murray and Ben Swane. Could the government be next? Or Malcolm Tucker? Perhaps we'll find out. Perhaps we won't. But if this is to really be the end, The Thick of It couldn't go out with a bigger bang.</p>",

Much of the resulting media coverage of the ITU, particularly in the US, has ranged from dismissive to aggressive, labelling the low-profile union <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/08/the_united_nations_and_the_internet_it_s_complicated\" title=\"\">obscure</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121004/02262820588/why-you-should-be-worried-about-itus-bizarre-claim-to-have-mandate-over-internet-security.shtml\" title=\"\">irrelevant</a> and exploiting American animosity for the UN.</p> <h2>Expanding profile</h2> <p>Much of the damning coverage has focused on proposed changes to the wording of several ITRs that appear to attempt to expand ITU's remit from telecoms to the internet. Given that the organisation began by co-ordinating telegraph communications and expanded to telephones, mobiles and data, it isn't unreasonable that its members might seek to expand its remit accordingly.</p> <p>But its members also include 700 private-sector organisations, and one of those, the European Telecommunications Network Operators (<a href=\"http://www.etno.eu/\" title=\"\">ETNO</a>), has caused the most contention among the US tech lobby by pushing for a <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57518427-38/eu-telcos-defend-un-internet-takeover-plans/\" title=\"\">proposal</a> that would effectively allow telcos to <a href=\"http://www.internetgovernance.org/2012/06/09/threat-analysis-of-wcit-part-3-charging-you-charging-me/\" title=\"\">charge companies</a> for delivering their content. \"What we want is a pricing model that ensures the revenue of operators and allows content providers to better compete in the market,\" ETNO's chairman Luigi Gambardella told La Repubblica this month. For a player like Google or anybody else delivering media over the net, that could prove very expensive.</p> <p>Google's chief internet evangelist <a href=\"http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html\" title=\"\">Vint Cerf</a> has been one of the big guns rolled out to lobby against the proposed regulations, describing the proposal to return to the \"sender pays\" principle as regressive. He claims that model had failed in the telephone world, particularly in developing countries where paying telcos high settlement rates had supposedly funded infrastructure, but instead ended up in the pockets of government treasuries or officials. \"It's the absolute antithesis of the internet where the participating parties on the edge of the network pay for access to it,\" he said. \"Freedom to innovate on the network has been largely a consequence of its economic model and its openness.\"</p> <p>The ad-hoc coalition lobbying against ITU proposals is made up of Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Comcast and AT&amp;T and 10 others, and is chaired by ambassador <a href=\"http://www.wileyrein.com/professionals.cfm?sp=bio&amp;id=625\" title=\"\">David Gross</a>, a lawyer, past chair of several delegations to the ITU, and former government international communications policy coordinator. He represented the group when it testified at a congressional hearing in May. \"[The sender pays proposal] is asking for trouble because it's suggesting the model, a model that is clearly working, would need to be revised for no apparent, real reason, other than the economic benefit of a few carriers,\" he told <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/fmr-us-ambassador-david-gross-explains-un-takeover-of-the-internet/\" title=\"\">Digital Trends</a> in August. \"I will quickly add that my coalition has major carriers, like AT&amp;T and Verizon, and they also think that this is the wrong way to go.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397915180\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350473525589/world-on-iphone-008.jpg\" alt=\"world on iphone\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global pressure: the ITU faces attacks from tech giants and hostile governments.

But make no mistake \u2013 this is absolutely business as usual for a company worth <a href=\"http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG\" title=\"\">$243bn</a> (\u00a3150bn) because the sender pays principle \u2013 which is said to be <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/261863-us-ambassador-warns-internet-fee-proposal-gaining-momentum-abroad\" title=\"\">gaining traction</a> among African and Arab delegations \u2013 would be catastrophic for its business, effectively taxing every interaction with its 700 million or so daily userbase.</p> <p>Add to that the threat posed to Google's income by Facebook's monopoly of social data and related advertising and the trend for \"privatised\" data inside mobile apps, and suddenly Google's mission to \"index the world's data\" seems rather more precarious. No wonder Google has made a campaign for the open web such a priority. This is what Google's chief legal officer, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/about/company/facts/management/\" title=\"\">David Drummond</a>, describes as a \"happy coincidence\". \"We are not ashamed,\" he says, \"to say the open web is good for the world, and happens to create good opportunities for business\".</p> <p>On the other hand, administration and organisation of the internet has been dominated by the US since Arpanet, the precursor to the modern internet, was established between four US universities in 1969, and a handful of US-controlled authorities followed. The biggest point of contention is <a href=\"http://www.icann.org/\" title=\"\">Icann</a>, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees management of internet address. Icann has responded to global pressure by internationalising its management board, though it is still a California-based non-profit. The US has, however, fiercely defended the root zone, the core domain name and numbering system run by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (Iana) \u2013 which remains on contract to the US Department of Commerce managed by Icann. On this, they will go down fighting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397915181\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/2/1343919312614/Internet-map-008.jpg\" alt=\"Internet map\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Circles of influence: tech giants fear hefty fees to telecoms companies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Challenging western dominance</h2> <p>Western dominance is the one of the biggest challenges for developing nations, says <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthigf.org/partners/steering-committee-profiles/alice-munyua/\" title=\"\">Alice Munyua</a>, a researcher and policy development expert, representing Kenya and Africa on forums such as Icann. \"It is a big concern for African governments and stakeholders, and not just because of how the internet is governed, but how it is developed from a commercial and technical perspective,\" she said. \"There is a feeling that we are not able to participate or contribute effectively because of the lack of capacity, skills and resources, so there's a digital divide in terms of access, but also in appropriating the internet for our own development.\"</p> <p>This, she believes, is the reason most African governments are supporting Arab proposals that countries should be compensated, by websites and internet services, for the flow of internet traffic they generate, and that wide-ranging privacy protections be introduced with exceptions for law enforcement.</p> <p>Drummond said he was sympathetic with developing countries who feel excluded from the western-dominated internet industry. \"But the treaty route, and the lowest common denominator approach mandating a certain set of technologies or regulations, is not the way to go.\" Munyua says even finding delegates who understand issues of internet management and governance can be difficult, and that with problems as basic as a unreliable electricity supply, African nations have different priorities when engaging with the ITU.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the ITU, the battle for control is more like a cold war. Russia, backed by several Middle Eastern countries and by China, has pushed for more <a href=\"https://dwmw.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/the-itu-and-the-real-threats-to-the-internet-part-iv-the-triumph-of-state-security-and-proposed-changes-to-the-itrs/\" title=\"\">cybersecurity regulations</a> and for more ITU control of domain names: this follows Russian president Vladimir Putin stating last year that Russia aimed to establish \"international control over the internet using the monitoring and supervisory capabilities of the International Telecommunication Union\". It has mooted cutting off internet access for anyone who threatens network security, called for a new UN body to replace Icann, and campaigned, but failed, with a previous UN proposal to create a cybersecurity code of conduct.</p> <p><a href=\"http://dymaxion.org/\" title=\"\">Eleanor Saitta</a>, technical director of the <a href=\"http://old.immi.is/?l=is&amp;p=FAQ\" title=\"\">International Modern Media Institute</a>, is also a hacker and security consultant. She warns that one of the biggest threats is the increasing militarisation of the internet. Even as the 193 nations of the ITU meet in December, some of those nations will be silently unleashing state-sponsored cyber attacks on each other, as well as surveillance and censorship on their citizens.</p> <p>Occasional reports of this flourishing industry surface; just last month the UK government was moved to block software exports to Egypt after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/09/block-on-exports-surveillance-equipment\" title=\"\">Gamma International</a> admitted selling a product that could remotely copy files, log keystrokes and record video. \"We are seeing governments wanting to get involved in censorship and surveillance and that truly has the potential to break the internet, because it will not function as a network or community where people can collaborate and share,\" said Saitta.</p> <p>America's corporate internet industry has already had to battle on home turf, however. In 2011, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/dec/23/sopa-stop-online-piracy-act\" title=\"\">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> (Sopa) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/18/sopa-pipa-consumption-only-internet\" title=\"\">Protect IP Act</a> (Pipa) proposed significantly expanded power for US law enforcement in identifying and penalising copyright infringement. Google was one of the loudest voices in this lobby, putting its sophisticated Washington policy department to work. The campaign, which saw high-profile sites including Wikipedia and Reddit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/jan/18/1\" title=\"\">black out</a> for a day in protest, has succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/20/pipa-vote-shelved-harry-reid\" title=\"\">postponing the legislation</a> for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397915182\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/23/1343060875157/Google--002.jpg\" alt=\"Google \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Public eye: Google's near-monopoly on search is coming under scrutiny. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Google in the dock</h2> <p>But lobbying by Google and its contemporaries against the ITU may well end up backfiring. Google is likely to face an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/15/google-antitrust-microsoft-case\" title=\"\">anti-trust</a> hearing in the US by the end of the year, investigating whether Google gives preferential treatment to its own products in search listings. The European Commission is also building a case against Google; the combination could stop Google expanding its US and UK businesses where Google accounts for 65% and 90% of the respective search markets. The search engine is also fighting a privacy battle against European regulators unhappy at how Google shares data between YouTube, Gmail and its other products. On one hand, Google is preaching for an open web, while on the other operating a virtual monopoly in search.</p> <p>The lobby's arguments on cybersecurity look weaker in the light of America's own Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or Cispa, which was widely condemned by civil rights groups for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/18/cispa-unprecedented-access-internet-privacy\" title=\"\">sacrificing the privacy</a> of its citizens to allow the government to trace hackers. Hot on the heels of Sopa, it was passed by Congress, killed off by the Senate and is now being revisited by the Senate. US defence secretary Leon Panetta claimed this week that the US risked a \"cyber Pearl Harbour\" if it did not resolve its cybersecurity issues. The US government itself was implicated in the development of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/30/state-sponsored-cyber-espionage-prevalent\" title=\"\">Stuxnet and Flame</a> viruses which was intended to derail and spy on the Iranian nuclear programme, and the White House has also claimed it was subject to an attack in October from hackers linked to the Chinese government.</p> <p>With so much to contend with on home turf, why, asks internet governance policy analyst professor <a href=\"http://www.internetgovernance.org/2012/06/09/threat-analysis-of-wcit-part-3-charging-you-charging-me/\" title=\"\">Milton Mueller</a>, is the US technology lobby chucking so much firepower at the declining institution of the ITU? They might do better, he suggests, to focus attention on Icann, pointing out problems with how governments engage with the group on advisory committees.</p> <p>Mueller says: \"We're all 'prepared to fight the ITU' \u2013 but we're ignoring threats that come from Icann, the US government and from nation states.

  "<p>The Liberal Democrats are considering proposing \"home rule\" for England and new regional assemblies as part of the party's manifesto for the next general election.</p> <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, the former UK party leader, said detailed discussions were under way inside the party on giving significant new powers over England-only policies to English MPs, as a counterweight to growing devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://scotlibdems.org.uk/homerule\" title=\"Federalism: the best future for Scotland\">report</a> on increasing Scotland's autonomy short of independence, Campbell suggested England would get its own parliament and network of regional assemblies within a new federal structure for the UK.</p> <p>\"I think it's inevitable that England will say, 'We should have more responsibilty for our own affairs,' \" Campbell told reporters on Wednesday. \"Our plan is that the answer to that case allows us to maintain the union but also allows us \u2013 using the old Liberal expression \u2013 to have home rule all around.\"</p> <p>Campbell said he expected the party's general election manifesto for 2015 would propose a new federal structure for the UK, as he unveiled a detailed plan to give the Scottish parliament far greater financial and political freedoms within the UK, as the Scottish Lib Dems' alternative to full independence.</p> <p>He said it was too early to state what exactly the party's manifesto would say about an English parliament. It was, however, the best solution to the so-called West Lothian question: why Scottish MPs can vote on English policies at Westminster when English MPs cannot vote on devolved Scottish policy at Holyrood.</p> <p>A working group set up by the UK party's policy committee was drafting a new strategy on constitutional reform that would eventually be presented to its UK party conference, but it had yet to issue a final report.</p> <p>That document would draw heavily on his report, commissioned by Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, on greater \"home rule\" for Scotland, a broad aspiration that often attracts the most support from Scottish voters in opinion polls on constitutional reform, and some pro-reform thinktanks.</p> <p>Campbell's blueprint \u2013 which assumes that Alex Salmond will lose the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/scottish-independence-referendum-agreement\" title=\"The Edinburgh Agreement\">2014 referendum on Scottish independence</a> \u2013 would include giving Holyrood control over about two thirds of its tax-raising, including setting its own income tax rates, while sharing common UK-wide policies such as foreign affairs, defence, pensions and VAT overseen by a federal parliament.</p> <p>Campbell's report, <a href=\"http://scotlibdems.org.uk/homerule\" title=\"an introduction by Sir Menzies Campbell\">Federalism: the best future for Scotland</a>, said giving Holyrood those powers would \"put the United Kingdom on track to become a federal union\".</p> <p>He predicted that would win support from Tory backbenchers, many of whom are openly demanding that English MPs at Westminster should have complete control over English legislation.</p> <p>The Scottish Lib Dems are the first of the pro-UK parties to publish detailed counter-proposals to independence. Scottish Labour has an internal working group drafting plans for extra devolution to Scotland, while some business leaders, civic groups and trades unions have started parallel debates about extra powers.</p> <p>Their significance has grown after Salmond conceded on Monday he had failed to win enough political support to add an extra question on greater devolution at the referendum; many opinion polls suggest that greater devolution is the most popular option for Scottish voters.</p>",
  "<p>A leading Corsican lawyer has been assassinated on his way to work, becoming the 15th victim this year of a spate of violence that police are linking to criminal gangs.</p> <p>Antoine Sollacaro, one of the most prominent lawyers on the island, was shot while driving to work in the capital city of Ajaccio.</p> <p>The 63-year-old, who was president of the bar association of Corsica, had defended a number of leading nationalists who have fought for independence from France and was a high-profile figure in the island's separatist movement.</p> <p>He defended Yvan Colonna, who is serving life in jail for murdering the French prefect Claude Erignac, the highest state representative on the Mediterranean island, in 1998.</p> <p>Sollacaro was pulling up in his Porsche at a garage near Ajaccio at 9am on Tuesday to buy a newspaper when the killers struck. His car was still moving as two men on a motorbike who had been following him approached the vehicle.</p> <p>The passenger jumped off the motorbike and shot the lawyer six times in the head and neck with an automatic pistol, before jumping back on the bike and speeding off.</p> <p>An hour before the murder, the body of Jean-Dominique Allegrini Simonetti, 50, a former nationalist militant, was discovered in mountains on the island.</p> <p>Manuel Valls, the French interior minister, insisted law and order must be returned to the island after the killings and said he would visit Corsica in the next few weeks.</p> <p>\"The fight for security will be carried out with the greatest resolve,\" he said. \"When the gowns of an advocate are attacked, it is a symbol of the challenge to the rule of law. The state will not forget the cruel price that its servants have paid [in Corsica]. It will mobilise to secure the end to this violence, something that is dearly wished by the vast majority of the population.\"</p> <p>Many of the killings have been linked to a settling of scores between members of rival crime gangs, some of whom also have links with nationalist movements.</p> <p>Sollacaro also defended some of the island's most notorious and feared criminal figures. Police are looking into his business and property dealings.</p> <p>Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French prime minister, said the island's plummet into lawlessness was \"intolerable\". He added: \"The government is determined to act against the plague of organised crime in Corsica.\"</p> <p>Corsica, two-thirds of which is mountainous, is a popular holiday destination and the birthplace of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. The northern town of Calvi also claims to be the birthplace of Christopher Columbus.</p> <p>After hearing of the murder, Alain Pacoud, the president of the Human Rights League in southern Corsica, a position previously held by Sollacaro, told French journalists: \"It's madness. Now we are not safe from anything. This could happen to anyone one day.\"</p> <p>He added: \"For a long time we thought this kind of thing was limited to the gangs, to the louts, but now they've killed a lawyer. Violence is poisoning the social body of the whole island.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's National Bulk Foods week in the US: an awareness campaign run by the <a href=\"http://www.bulkisgreen.org\" title=\"Bulk is Green Council website\">Bulk is Green Council</a> (BIG). Although this may conjure up visions of super-sized portions, bulk buying isn't about quantity but thrift.</p> <p>\"For us, bulk buying means buying in large quantities from big-box stores like Costco or Walmart in an effort to save money,\" a BIG spokesperson says. \"It also means buying foods from the bulk bins in the bulk foods aisle of a grocery store, and we want to promote this.\"</p> <p>The bulk food aisles are where shoppers can take their own tubs and fill them with dried goods: pasta, cereals, rice, spices. According to BIG, bulk buying organic rolled oats in this way is 219% less expensive than buying organic packaged oats.</p> <p>BIG hopes to encourage more than 1,000 stores to offer further discounts on bulk foods during the week.</p> <p>While the UK does not yet have bulk buy aisles in its supermarkets, there are ways to shop that reduce packaging and maximise how much food you get for your money. Here is our guide to just that, and if you have other tips to share please post them below.</p> <h2>Stock up on wholefoods</h2> <p>In the UK, you can expect to save up to 25% if you buy direct from organic wholesalers such as <a href=\"http://www.Sumawholesale.com\" title=\"Suma website\">Suma</a>. However, while delivery is free, most have high minimum orders (Suma's is \u00a3250) so you will probably need to club together with friends or neighbours to take advantage.</p> <p>With food prices rising, Suma reports a \"significant rise\" in buying groups being set up to share large bulk buy items.</p> <p>Currently, the website is selling a 10kg sack of chickpeas for \u00a316.69. At supermarkets they are usually sold in 500g packets, which cost \u00a31.09 at Sainsbury's and 99p at Tesco. The Suma price works out at 83p for 500g.</p> <p>On organic chopped tomatoes, Suma offers 12 tins for \u00a36.21, or 51p a tin. This compares with 89p at Waitrose and Sainsbury's, 79p at Tesco and 75p at Asda.</p> <p>Also try <a href=\"http://www.Infinityfoodswholesale.co.uk\" title=\"Infinity Foods\">Infinity Foods</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Highlandwholefoods.co.uk\" title=\"Highland Wholefoods\">Highland Wholefoods</a>.</p> <h2>Independent supermarkets</h2> <p>Supermarkets are catching on to our bulk buying habits and offering larger packaged items, but many deals don't stack up.</p> <p>\"Supermarkets are expensive places to shop whether you're buying bulk or not,\" says Joanna Blythman, author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007341429\" title=\"What to Eat website\">What to Eat</a>. \"Supermarket pricing tries to trick consumers into thinking that a larger pack means better value, but that's often not the case. In fact, sometimes the smaller packs work out cheaper.\"</p> <p>However, independent supermarkets and wholefood shops are a different matter. If you're lucky enough to live near <a href=\"http://www.Unicorn-grocery.co.uk\" title=\"Unicorn Grocery website\">Unicorn Grocery</a> in Manchester or London-based <a href=\"http://www.Thepeoplessupermarket.org\" title=\"Peoples Supermarket website\">The People's Supermarket</a> you can save cash by going for the largest pack size.</p> <p>At Unicorn, for example, porridge oats cost \u00a31.19 a kilo, but the store also sells 25kg sacks for \u00a320.75.</p> <p>\"It costs us less to bring a whole sack of oats to the shop floor because we've not packaged it into smaller containers so we can offer a saving,\" says Unicorn's Dvir Newman.</p> <p>If Unicorn shoppers want to buy a whole box of apples or cartons of fruit juice, they're given a 10%-20% discount.</p> <p>Like Unicorn, The People's Supermarket sells its fruit and vegetables loose, so while customers are free to bulk buy 5kg of carrots, others can buy just one.</p> <p>If you do shop at mainstream supermarkets, stocking up on long-life items when there is an offer may sometimes work. Compare prices on MySupermarket.com beforehand and shop with friends to take advantage of three-for-two offers.</p> <h2>Wholesalers</h2> <p>It may not be an ethical choice, but cash-and-carry giants like Costco.co.uk and Booker.co.uk can be money-savers. Costco charges a fee (approximately \u00a325,) but membership is open to many employees as well as business owners. Booker is free but only for business owners and the self-employed.</p> <p>Bulk buys of rice, pasta, fruit juice (and meat, frozen vegetables and cheese if you have the fridge-freezer to store it) can knock your shopping bill down by half, but the downside is storage.</p> <p>Again, not one for ethical shoppers, but Amazon sells bulk buy groceries. Savings vary but can be small: currently, 24 cans of Heinz baked beans are \u00a316.08 (RRP \u00a320.48), whereas they are on offer at Costco for \u00a37.89. Delivery is free but can take a while.</p> <p>There's also online wholesaler <a href=\"http://www.shortersclub.co.uk/\" title=\"Shorters Club website\">Shortersclub.co.uk</a>. There's a wide array of groceries and it's free to join. Large households, which can take advantage of economies of scale, should save money. The minimum order is \u00a340 and delivery is \u00a35.99.</p> <p>At Shorters Club, Tilda wholegrain basmati rice costs \u00a317.27 for 10 500g packs, or \u00a31.72 each. A single pack costs \u00a32.49 at Sainsbury's. Amazon sells Tilda wholegrain in packs of five for \u00a39.70 (\u00a31.94 each).</p> <h2>Don't overdo it</h2> <p>A box load of anything isn't a cheap deal if it's days away from the best before date. Check before you stock up and be realistic about what you'll actually eat.</p> <p>And while most people are unlikely to gorge on porridge oats, the same can't be said for chocolate, nuts, biscuits, cheese and ground coffee. You might find that having more in the cupboard results in you using more, so unless you have good willpower stocking up could prove costly.</p> <p>So there are our tips for buying in bulk.

Don't remain quiet.\" Udaltsov could face up to 10 years in prison if charged and found guilty of \"organising mass unrest\".</p> <p>The head of a group called the Left Front, Udaltsov has served several short stints in jail over the last two years after convictions for offences ranging from staging illegal protests to administrative violations such as jaywalking, which his supporters say are a way to silence the charismatic leader.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/17/putin-protest-organiser-hunger-strike\" title=\"\">Udaltsov, who has forged ties with the popular Communist party</a>, has toured Russia's distant regions aiming to drum up support for the growing opposition to Vladimir Putin. The authorities are said to fear his links with the country's emasculated trade unions, a potentially large pool of support.</p> <p>\"There is one goal here \u2013 to stifle any protest to the maximum,\" Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist party, told journalists. \"There is no one left in the Kremlin to say the word 'no'.\"</p> <p>The investigative committee said the state's case against Udaltsov was opened following a report attacking him on the state-run television channel NTV.</p> <p>The channel has been at the forefront of a propaganda campaign aimed at discrediting the opposition, namely with two documentary-style reports called <a href=\"http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/347117/\" title=\"\">Anatomy of a Protest</a>. The first expounded on Putin's claims that the opposition was funded by the US state department. The second aired earlier this month and focused almost exclusively on Udaltsov, claiming he was plotting with an alleged revolutionary from neighbouring Georgia to overthrow the Russian state.</p> <p>Using grainy footage from a hidden camera, NTV claimed to show Udaltsov and two associates \u2013 both of whom were also detained on Wednesday and face similar criminal investigations \u2013 meeting Givi Targamadze, former head of the Georgian parliament's defence committee and a close ally of the country's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. The group is seen discussing tactics and financing related to the Russian opposition. Udaltsov has denied the allegations.</p> <p>Sergei Parkhomenko, a prominent journalist and opposition activist, said the state's use of NTV \"creates a new situation and opens a sort of new epoch\". \"The ruling group has gone over a certain psychological barrier\u2026 to the open use of the press it controls as a part of the repressive apparatus, an instrument of direct violence against citizens.\"</p> <p>\"We can now say that NTV \u2026 has become a part of the security structure,\" he said. One of Putin's first acts as president at the turn of the century was raiding NTV and bringing it under state control.</p> <p>The investigative committee statement on Udaltsov included a stark warning to the tens of thousands of Russians who have taken to the streets to protest at Putin's continuing rule: \"I would like to draw the attention of those who thought that in our country you can organise riots, plan and prepare terrorist attacks and other acts that threaten the lives and health of Russians with total impunity: you underestimate the professionalism of the Russian secret services and are badly informed of Russian law, including a criminal code which allows for lifetime imprisonment in such cases,\" it said.</p> <p>The investigative committee has also brought charges against Alexey Navalny, a prominent opposition leader, for alleged economic crimes. He faces up to 10 years in prison.</p> <p>Opposition activists have called a protest for Saturday in support of Udaltsov.</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian <a href=\"http://election.tumblr.com/\">collaborated with Tumblr on another live-giffing</a> of the presidential debate on Thursday night.

One of the most awkward encounters occurred early on, when Obama and Romney charged towards each another, each attempting to make a point.

She was no Jim Lehrer, but her performance was further confirmation that Martha Raddatz is simply a badass. If we follow the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=raddatz&amp;src=typd\">will of the internet,</a> Raddatz will be moderating the next one. Crowley's best moment came when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/obama-romney-second-debate-live#block-507e160658f91d7bbadac749\">she fact-checked Romney over Libya, live on air</a>.</p> <h2>The tired</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0jpeuLww1rg2rf7o1_r1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0jpeuLww1rg2rf7o1_r1_500.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\" /> </figure>  <p> Obama was certainly more animated than the first debate, but Joe from Islip wasn't impressed.</p> <h2>The binder full of women</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0lwdHHNQ1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0lwdHHNQ1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\"/> </figure>  <p> One of the night's indisputable gems was Romney's response to a question about how he tried to diversify his cabinet when governor of Massachusetts.

As tends to be the case with debates it depends on who you ask. If there's any consensus, it was that there was an intense personal hostility between Romney and Obama. These guys seem to genuinely hate each other. It's enough to make one miss the carefree days of Herman Cain.</p>",
  "<p>President Obama brought his A-game to the debate Tuesday evening. After demurring in the first presidential debate, this Obama was hardhitting and unwilling to cede ground to Mitt Romney. There were many exciting moments, but will any of them move the polls? </p> <p>An immediate look at the post-debate \"insta\" snapshots suggest that a gain for the president is possible. The <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57533850/poll-obama-edges-romney-in-second-debate/?tag=MaxDeep;HeroImage\">CBS/Knowledge Networks</a> poll of undecided voters had Obama winning the debate 37% to 30%. A <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/colorado-voters-give-obama-narrow-victory-in-debate.html\">Public Policy Polling</a> survey of debate watchers in the swing state of Colorado gave Obama a 48% to 44% edge. A <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/breaking-cnn-poll-obama-edges-romney-in-debate/\">CNN/ORC</a> nationwide poll of debate watchers pegged Obama the winner 46% to 39%. </p> <p>These wins are solid, especially considering that debate watchers tend to be a few more points Republican. They suggest that, if nothing else, it's unlikely that Obama will lose ground. The question as to whether he will gain any is more in doubt. </p> <p>First, it's important to remember that a lot of the movement after the debates is about the <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/02/why-news-coverage-of-the-debate-may-matter-more-than-the-debate/\">media spin</a>. There can be little doubt when watching, listening to and reading the media that they are ready to declare that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate\">Obama was back in style</a>. The issue is that many sources also seemed to suggest that, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/258396461845315584\">NBC's Chuck Todd</a>, \"Romney seemed to be ready for it.\" That would seem to suggest more of a tie than anything else. </p> <p>The question over whether this narrative becomes a solid Obama victory will likely revolve around video playback of the many confrontations between the candidates. One, in particular, stood out \u2013 regarding Libya and whether the terrorist attacks on the US consul to Libya and others in Benghazi were or were not called a terrorist act by President Obama. It was a crucial moment in the debate and Obama claimed that he'd said on 12 September that it was a terrorist attack, while Romney disagreed. Moderator Candy Crowley, acting as impromptu fact-checker, mostly sided with Obama. The showdown left a \"mark\" on Romney, said Todd.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/16/fact-check-did-obama-really-call-consulate-attack-in-libya-act-terror/\">whole truth is fuzzier</a> than the debate let on. In his 12cSeptember remarks in the Rose Garden, Obama did use the word \"terror\", but he didn't refer specifically to the events in Benghazi when using the word. This has become <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/romney-campaign-will-litigate-libya\">a focal point</a> in a lot of post-debate discussion \u2013 and Republicans have fought back hard. How the media handles this Libya question and the American people's response could be key in determining \"who won\" the debate as a whole.</p> <p>Second, Obama's victory this time around doesn't match the scale of Romney's from the first debate in the polls. Romney won that debate by a recording-breaking 42 points in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">CNN poll</a> and took undecideds by 24 points in the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57525698/poll-uncommitted-voters-say-romney-wins-debate/?pageNum=2&amp;tag=page\">CBS survey</a>. We also know that respondents in the CNN poll \u2013 by an 18 percentage point margin \u2013 were more likely to say they would vote for Romney over Obama thanks to the first debate, compared to a tie on this question after the second debate.</p> <p>And despite these massive wins, Romney picked up a comparatively small <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/romney-debate-bounce-real-but-fading\">4 points nationally</a>. We can therefore try to determine how a smaller Obama win in the second debate insta-polls might predict how much ground he will gain. The ratio of winning the debate and picking up national support from the first debate was along the lines of 10.5 (a 42-point debate victory margin over a 4-point ultimate gain) in the CNN poll, and 6 (a 24-point debate victory margin over a 4-point ultimate gain) in the CBS poll.</p> <p>If these ratios hold for the second debate and given Obama's insta-poll margins, then Obama should gain, maybe, a single point nationally. This is not rigorous exercise, but suggests that Obama doesn't stand to gain too much ground. </p> <p>Third, it's unlikely that this debate will deflate Republican enthusiasm. Perhaps the biggest gains for Romney after the first debate came because he was able to take an already wide likely/registered voter gap and expand it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/romney-v-obama-mixed-signals-polls\">just a bit</a>. There's nothing in the data to suggest that Republicans were deflated by this performance. They are, for instance, standing strong with Romney on the Benghazi attacks, which tends to support the idea that Romney didn't do poorly so much as Obama did well. </p> <p>Fourth, Democratic enthusiasm will hold thanks to this debate, yet it likely never dropped. If you had any Democratic friends, you probably saw a few who held their heads low after the first debate. You probably saw more hardcore Democrats, however, who offered an impassioned defense of the president. The polls reflect that. After the first debate, Public Policy Polling surveyed Virginia and Wisconsin voters and found that Democratic enthusiasm was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/joe-biden-teeth-paul-ryan-hair\">stable compared to pre-debate</a>. I guess it's possible that Democrats are more enthusiastic than ever, thanks to this debate, but I think the post-convention/pre-debate Democratic enthusiasm is as high as it's going to get. That means the registered/likely voter gap will remain. </p> <p>Fifth, Romney must remain favorable to the American public and probably will. Before the first debate, Romney was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/mitt-romney-fault-loses\">seen unfavorably</a> by much of the American public. That <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/obama_romney_favorable_unfavorable.html\">changed dramatically</a> thanks to the first showdown. Obama, on the other hand, has had his favorable ratings stay relatively consistent for months. This suggests that Romney's gains were due to perceptions of Romney, less than they were due to Obama's performance.</p> <p>If that hypothesis is correct, then Obama probably can't gain back voters with a good performance. Romney can only lose them with a bad one. There's not a lot in the numbers to suggest he did. </p> <p>So, I'm not expecting much, if any, movement from this debate. If it does occur, it will be favorable towards President Obama. He'll take that, in this tight race, as every little bit counts. But remember that predictions about post-debate movements are not perfect and that any movements or lack thereof could be erased by <em>next week</em>'s debate.</p>",
  "<p>Jimmy Savile's long-standing former personal assistant has spoken out for the first time about the child abuse scandal, saying the presenter \"thought he was untouchable\".</p> <p>She also claimed that he had a terrifying temper that frightened everyone from hospital staff to charity workers.</p> <p>Janet Cope, who was Savile's PA for 32 years until she was suddenly sacked by him in 2001, described him as \"eccentric, manipulative, controlling\" and said he was like Peter Pan, \"forever surrounding himself with youngsters\".</p> <p>She told the Daily Mirror: \"I was frightened to death of him and I wasn't the only one. He loved the power he had over people. Power was important to him. He didn't care if he upset people. Jim had no feeling, no emotions at all.\"</p> <p>\"On the face of it, Jim led a celibate, nomadic and simple life which may have disguised a more sordid double life. I don't know, but he was clever enough to believe he'd get away with it, and if he did, he fooled me and many others,\" she added.</p> <p>When the allegations of child abuse first emerged two weeks ago, Cope was among those who remained loyal to the former star. Now, she concedes she may have been hoodwinked by him. \"He told me: 'Never risk being caught out. Always ensure that you're in total control of any situation'. Sadly, the evidence against Jim does seem a bit overwhelming and, really, I'm at a loss for words,\" she said.</p> <p>\"He thought he was untouchable because he was hand in glove with the hospitals, royalty and the prime minister.\"</p> <p>She said he was a controlling figure who only once showed distress when his mother died. She told of how he lit up a cigar in her newly painted home even though she asked him not to and when she opened office windows to let smoke out, he shouted at her. \"Close them, I say when the windows should be closed, no one else.\"</p> <p>She revealed she was sacked at a public meeting of doctors and administrators at a meeting in Stoke Mandeville hospital in 2001 when he blurted out \"She's out\".</p> <p>She also said he avoided appearing in public where he might be faced with clever people asking questions, including Oxford and Cambridge unions.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>On balance I was glad that Theresa May decided that Pentagon computer hacker, Gary McKinnon, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-not-extradited-may\" title=\"\">will not be extradited</a> to the United States to face charges that could have seen him sent to prison for up to 70 years. But you can't please everyone. The US government is cross, so is former Labour home secretary, Alan Johnson. As for the friends of recently deported terror suspects such as Barbar Ahmad, and of allegedly dodgy British businessmen, they are accusing May of double standards.</p> <p>Who's right? Mostly May, I think. McKinnon seems to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-hacker-sparked-storm\" title=\"\">a pretty inoffensive computer nerd</a> who from 1995 to 2002 fooled around with the US defence network \u2013 and damaged a lot of kit in the process \u2013 out of innocent curiosity, looking for UFOs and also trying to show how poor the encryption was. But instead of being grateful to the Londoner, the Yanks threw the book at him. I could have told you that, Gary, if you'd only asked.</p> <p>In the years which followed 9/11 when the US introduced what amounts to a state of emergency (still in place) successive Labour home secretaries like Johnson, who don't come out of this very well, were obligingly prepared to let McKinnon go. I remember one of them explaining that he had to let the law, including the 2003 extradition treaty, take its course. A bit fatalistic, I'd say.</p> <p>Egged on by the Daily Mail, whose civil liberty record is strong but very selective, May has found the obvious loophole. McKinnon, whose life has been on hold since his first arrest out of the blue at home in Crouch End in 2002 by a detective from the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism (common among computer geeks, say some) and the risk of a suicide attempt in the US is strong.</p> <p>As with the European arrest warrant, also under attack in Britain, the extradition treaty has been accused of being one-sided in the US's favour \u2013 though Mr Justice Scott-Baker's review concluded that the accusation is wrong. May however has decided to raise the bar on which forum \u2013 ie court, British or US \u2013 a case should be held in and to remove future home secretaries from intervening in the same way. A muddled decision as Tuesday's Guardian leader <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-feelgood-mystery-editorial\" title=\"\">notes</a>.</p> <p>The real problem is two-fold; three-fold if we count the cost as the Sunday Telegraph did <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9606795/How-Britain-pays-27m-a-year-to-return-EUs-wheelbarrow-thieves.html\" title=\"\">here </a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9606981/New-battle-with-European-Union-over-justice-powers.html\" title=\"\">here</a>at the weekend.</p> <p>Britain has good courts, strong traditions of legality and a lot of lawyers with time on their hands who are good at upholding due process, so that we tend to process requests from overseas and also take them to all available appeals. That means both here and in Europe, where the court of human rights takes on too much and also gets involved in local issues of no general importance, cases it should leave to local courts, its backlog grows by the day.</p> <p>In addition, some jurisdictions have some very odd habits. A British man was sought by Portugal quite recently on the charge \u2013 some years after the incident \u2013 of murdering a man who was still alive. The Sunday Telegraph unearthed a costly extradition process over a \u00a370 stolen wheel-barrow. To add insult to injury, some unpleasant characters who are here illegally and have committed nasty crimes, use our laws \u2013 notably the Human Rights Act, \u2013 to stay here instead of being sent home when they leave prison.</p> <p>May, whose government is always sounding off against the act (let's see if they ever find a practical way to curb its excesses without doing much more harm to human rights), was happy to use article 3 to rescue McKinnon. The Human-Rights-Act-bashing Mail was happy to praise her for doing so on Wednesday over seven pages, and talked about her as a future leadership contender \u2013 a sweetie often handed out in Fleet St, but rarely wisely.</p> <p>Hats off to the Mail for this campaign, but hats on again for its selective outrage. McKinnon is luckiest of all to have a tough mum in Janis Sharp, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/son-gary-mcinnon-justice-at-last\" title=\"\">wrote in the Guardian this week</a> following the decision.</p> <p>The American case is different from the European one. As accused business executives like the NatWest Three and Chris Tappin \u2013 he's now on bail in Houston, tagged and banned from the internet, awaiting charges of selling ship missiles to Iran (like the Reagan administration did) \u2013 discovered when indicted, American prosecutors love to plea bargain. \"Admit this lesser offence or you may go to jail for 50 years.\" It's efficient and they get more results on financial crime than we do, but it's also rough justice. But remember, just because they're Brits doesn't automatically make them innocent. We simply don't know.</p> <p>There is also the US federal prison system. When Abu Hamza was finally sent west after gaming the despised British justice system \u2013 and its despised benefit system too \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2216530/Tom-Leonard-Abu-Hamza-New-York-Is-Hook-heading-Hell.html\" title=\"\">the Mail wrote a slightly gleeful account</a> of how grim American prisons can be. It can't be said too often that there are too many people in US prisons, that half of them are black or ethnic minority and that the country has taken a regrettable wrong turn on penal policy. Alas, Britain has followed a similar path since the mid-90s.</p> <p>Be that as it may, the US was spectacularly destablised by the 9/11 attacks and its badly executed responses under the Bush administration \u2013 its assault on civil liberties not confined to non-Americans. Some of it may well be justified in anguished circumstances. So, naive or not, McKinnon has a case to answer and should answer it in a British court since he was on British soil when he hacked those military computers.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, a clean-cut, lantern-jawed fellow in the best Hollywood traditions, should arrange for it to be done. It may slightly appease hurt feelings in Washington and New York, though US hypocrisy on extradition (\"No, you can't have those patriotic IRA bombers back\") is in a class of its own. Former Bush White House counsel, David Rivkin, sounded like an angry bully on Radio 4's World at One on Tuesday. The US was taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p> <p>But what about the terror suspects whose families feel aggrieved that they were flown out with Abu Hamza the other day, to face fearful unknowns. Are they nuts under the American sledgehammer too? It's not so easy, is it?</p> <p>As you will not have read in most newspapers, the family of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Ahmad\" title=\"\">Babar Ahmad</a>, arrested on terrorist conspiracy related charges in 2004, issued a dignified statement on Tuesday:</p> <p>\"We strongly welcome the decision not to extradite Gary McKinnon. We would not want his family to experience the pain and suffering we have all been enduring since Babar was extradited.</p> <p>\"However, questions do need to be asked as to why, within the space of two weeks, a British citizen with Asperger's accused of computer related activity is not extradited, while two other British citizens, one with Asperger's, engaged in computer-related activity, are extradited. A clear demonstration of double standards.</p> <p>\"That Theresa May felt compelled to postpone both the McKinnon decision on several occasions and the introduction of the forum bar (which would have prevented Babar's extradition) demonstrates her willingness to make vulnerable individuals like Gary suffer in her determination to extradite others.</p> <p>\"Many of our supporters are angry at what appears to be blatant old-fashioned racism under which all British citizens are equal but some are more equal than others.\"</p> <p>Some fair points, well made, there. But from what little we know \u2013 look at that Wiki summary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Ahmad\" title=\"\">again</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.freebabarahmad.com/\" title=\"\">official website</a> Tooting-born Babar Ahmad is not quite the Crouch End computer nerd with no political agenda that Gary McKinnon is, though he was an engineer working in IT before his arrest. He's charged with computer-related offences too and certainly had interesting website material at home.</p> <p>All the same, the British authorities decided that there was insufficient evidence on which to charge him. The US, in whose politics paranoia has been a constant theme, thinks otherwise.</p> <p>Guardian veteran, Victoria Brittain <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/condemned-abu-hamza-stereotype\" title=\"\">wrote an impassioned comment piece</a> you may have missed here which accuses the UK and EU legal systems of all sorts of things, not least of stereotyping Muslims, of bundling up some very different cases and of justifying the bulk deportation behind the singular and unappetising figure of Abu Hamza. One of those deported, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/talha-ahsan-behind-bars-for-six-years-without-charge-and-a-family-losing-faith-in-the-rule-of-law-8113730.html\" title=\"\">Talha Ahsan</a>, also suffers from Asperger's, so Brittain notes.</p> <p>All now face long pre-trial detention and an uncertain fate. US courts do not convict to order as courts in Russia and China have recently shown themselves to do in political cases \u2013 the Pussy Riot trial in Moscow, the Bo family affair in provincial China \u2013 but the prospects look bleak. It's hard to tell the extent to which one or any of the accused may be seriously compromised by terrorist-related activity or just caught up in the wrong place or company at a bad time, as some Guantanamo Bay detainees were.</p> <p>It's troubling and I can appreciate the anger of families who will support their loved ones, whatever the facts may be. But it's not quite the same as the Crouch End One.</p>",
  "<p>Last week I was chatting to my dad. He's a retired head teacher who taught for 50 years (starting in 1957), I'm a teacher who started 17 years ago. We were, as teachers do, putting the world to rights. The conversation included Gove (of course), Ofsted (how annoying Wilshaw is), the exam mess, funding, unions, SATS, and so on, the usual topics. This is, on the whole, the same conversation we have been having for nearly 20 years. Swap Gove for Baker, Wilshaw for Woodhead. But this time the conversation ended differently. Usually we have a whinge, discuss how things could be done differently and agree we would do a better job given half a chance. We like to complain (what teacher does not) but we always ended our conversations agreeing things are, on balance, better than they were in the past.</p> <p>Essentially we are both educational optimists and although we complain about the specifics we have always believed things are generally improving. Although the people who run the education system are politicians who know nothing about education (with a few notable exceptions), they are mostly motivated by a desire to improve the life chances of all children (I told you we are optimists) and are striving, in their wrong-headed politician's way, to make the system run as well as it can.</p> <p>Ed Balls was a good example of this kind of minister, motivated by all the right reasons to do all the wrong things, not because he's out to wreck the system but because he's an economist and does not know anything about teaching. Wilshaw is another example, but from a different category (like Woodhead). Someone who used to know a lot about education but since becoming a politician has forgotten what he once knew. He does, I believe, sincerely want to see the system improve and would like to see all schools become shining beacons of educational efficiency, but he's destroying teacher morale by some of his less thought out utterances and making it less likely for things to improve. He should learn the maxim, 'efficient with things, effective with people'. Annoying, though he is, Wilshaw is not a danger to the central principle of education that all children are entitled to meaningful educational experiences that will prepare them for their future lives.</p> <p>Gove, on the other hand, is genuinely dangerous. He's driven by an entirely different ideological motivation and appears to have a deep contempt for the idea that all children should be given equal opportunity to thrive and achieve. Through his actions since coming into office, Gove seems hell bent on smashing the educational consensus and dismantling 68 years of educational progress. In the emerging Govite system, students at school today and those in the future will have their education geared to the perceived needs of the economy. Their educational experiences, both at primary and secondary, will be narrowed to a small set of academic skills and knowledge that can be measured, logged and analysed using data-tracking software. There is not enough room for all to succeed, so some will have to fail. Its called rigour.</p> <p>Rigour is the new unquestioned mantra of modern politicians in education. We can hear it from both sides. Another is 'driving up standards' (an odious metaphor) and 'making teachers accountable'. All, it is assumed, with the purpose of improving outcomes for children and narrowing the gap between rich and poor. This is the consensus view. But Gove has a different agenda. He's not interested in fixing or improving education for everyone. In his eyes the system doesn't work, never worked and is not worth fixing. It seems, his drive is to create a narrow elitist educational system that benefits industry and privileges the economic and political elite. He has no intention, whatsoever, of increasing social mobility. His aims, in fact, are to widen the gap, reinforce the barriers, and turn education into a business. If you want to see what education will be like in this country once he's finished take a look at the worst excesses of the American model.</p> <p>My point is Gove is not like the other education ministers we have had in the past - inept, ill informed and interfering, but fundamentally well-meaning - he's a wrecker, he does not want to improve our education system, he wants to destroy it.</p> <p>You might be thinking at this point \"hang on, that's a bit harsh\" but remember, I'm an optimist. In fact, when it comes to education, I'm a rose-tinted, wide-eyed, Pollyanna. I love teaching; it's my favourite thing. But for the first time in my career I'm thinking of stopping, I'm planning an exit strategy, getting out before the machine eats me up, and I'm not the only one. According to some reports over half the profession are looking for other career paths. My hunch is this is the tip of the iceberg and we're beginning to see the end of teaching as a profession and the entire privatisation of the education system.</p> <p>It's a depressing thought, particularly as I have two children at high school and one at primary. So this time, when my dad and I ended our regular catch-up and grumble, we did not finish feeling better for it. On the contrary we ended feeling much worse and more depressed about the future than we have ever been.</p> <p>Which might be the end of this article - another in a long line of depressingly familiar blogs acknowledging things have grown so bad the only way is out - except recently I've been reading the comments sections at the end of these blogs and have noticed a theme developing. Among the usual trolls and troglodytes there have been a growing number of contributors - teachers, parents, academics, students and even Ofsted inspectors - who have been saying enough is enough, we're not powerless in this process. We have to make a stand and create an opposition to the wrecking of our education system built on universal opportunity. Not through the unions, whose business is to protect worker rights; or through the Labour Party, who made a mess of it when they had the chance, but through a grass-roots movement of ordinary teachers, parents, students and others who want to protect our education system (with all its flaws) and demand an end to this process of ideologically driven destruction.</p> <p>If you feel the same way then <a href=\"http://free-education.org\">click here</a>, sign the petition and join the opposition to political interference in education and the establishment of an independent professional teaching body to oversee the protection of universal educational opportunity and the long term development of a world class education system for the 21st century.</p> <p><em>Tim Taylor is an AST teacher working in Norfolk and editor of <a href=\"http://mantleoftheexpert.com\">mantleoftheexpert.com</a></em>.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/sustainability/publications/carbon-disclosure-project/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=0912-CDP-2012+social\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">annual report</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/Pages/HomePage.aspx\" title=\"\">Carbon Disclosure Project</a> (CDP), published last month, provides a mix of bad and good news.</p> <p>\"Companies continue to invest in emissions reductions, but these are typically short term, cost cutting measures such as energy or resource efficiency, rather than long term capital investments in low carbon technology,\" the report states.</p> <p>In short, companies are pushing the limits of what they can do despite neither regulatory support nor customer demand. They can achieve efficiencies that reduce costs over the short term, but long term efficiencies are simply not achievable without a broader mandate.</p> <p>This is no longer of merely academic interest. In recent weeks, we have had numerous indications that there are fewer paths that will lead to a livable earth. This summer, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/13/arctic-ice-melting-faster.html?cmp=rss\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">Arctic ice disappeared</a> at a rate 50% higher than predicted and may vanish in 10 years. Throughout the northern hemisphere, record droughts, high temperatures and floods have been documented. The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/geo/\" title=\"\">reported</a> last summer that progress had been made on only four of 90 of the most important environmental goals.</p> <p>Because deeper carbon reduction strategies carry higher capital costs and risks, companies on their own cannot take the actions necessary to meet the carbon challenge. As the CDP states, \"82% of [Global 500] companies have set targets to reduce emissions, [but] these are not nearly ambitious enough to achieve governments' goals to limit warming to 2\u00b0C\".</p> <p>A remarkable lack of political leadership regarding sustainability issues forces well-intentioned companies into tight corners. Such firms are able to read the news and see the possibilities ahead, but find it difficult to realise the opportunities in sustainability without supportive market structures and regulations. Further, <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20121004-climate-scepticism-highest-us-britain\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">in the UK and US</a>, customers are much less likely to believe in a causal connection between human action and climate impacts.</p> <p>Indeed, America's inattention to climate change has been described <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/us-presidential-debates-global-warming?newsfeed=true\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">in the Guardian</a> as the \"2012 election's only bipartisan consensus\".</p> <p>America, though dominant, is not alone. Ed Miliband, the British Labour party leader somehow omitted it from his recent speech to the party convention, offering no signals to business regarding how he might differ from David Cameron on the issue. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, has placed his economic bets on the oil sands and their requisite pipelines rather than on increased research, education and productivity.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/changing-behaviour-scale-that-matters?newsfeed=true\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">recent blog</a>, Oliver Balch pondered over what business could do to get customers to respond to issues that companies find so important. Two prominent business scholars present very different answers to his question. One says people may seem complacent and unresponsive to sustainability initiatives because they don't understand the science. The other shows evidence that people may not trust the science.</p> <p>First, Jon Sterman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has worked for years to help business students and executives to understand the system dynamics of climate change. He believes that people can learn to understand the mechanisms of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. Knowing more about carbon levels will help to drive the behaviour of policy makers, whether in business or government. To this end, he has developed numerous <a href=\"http://climateinteractive.org/\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">simulations</a> that allow users to control few variables and see their impact on sea levels and temperatures. In his view, when leaders understand causal connections, they can drive behaviour through improved regulation and business policy.</p> <p>Andrew Hoffman of the University of Michigan, however, thinks that the problem is lack of a social consensus and has identified <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/climate_science_as_culture_war\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">means</a> by which he thinks one can be developed. In his view, honest brokers can help to interpret science better than climate scientists themselves. Once people understand the statistics of causality better, a consensus can be developed that can drive substantive change. He points to the long battle to change smoking behaviour in response to scientific evidence about the connections between tobacco use and lung cancer. In short, trusted sources can broker or market better ideas until people start choosing better alternatives.</p> <p>Both of these opinions are correct. We need to understand the science and we need to trust it. When you look at the list of the four goals on which UNEP found we have made progress, it is clearer:</p> <p>\u2022 Reducing substances that deplete the ozone layer</p> <p>\u2022 Removing lead from fuel</p> <p>\u2022 Increasing access to improved water supplies</p> <p>\u2022 Boosting research on ways to reduce pollution of the marine environment</p> <p>We understand water pollution, ozone holes and lead poisoning. We believe they exist. We can and do act.</p> <p>Consumers won't buy cold water clothes washing detergent until they understand and believe in the impact of their decisions on the earth. Governments will not invest in high speed rail if they do not see a compelling need to replace congested motorways with carbon-free alternatives. Financial decisions at all levels are being deferred because we don't understand our impact on the climate.</p> <p>Companies who seek to make larger capital investments and gain higher efficiencies may first need to invest in increasing the scientific understanding of investors, employees, customers and regulators.</p> <p>The key is to go micro at the 86 individual targets and figure out narrow, targeted plans for as many as possible that marshal the evidence on cause and effect, tally the costs and suggest a way forward. We will be considering many of these <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/geo/pdfs/geo5/Progress_towards_goals.pdf\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\"\">goals</a> in coming weeks, exploring ways in which companies around the world can be encouraged to progress towards their resolution.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>Resource cutbacks are putting an increasing strain on the prison system in England and Wales, with a growing current of deaths, attempted suicides and assaults, according to the chief inspector of prisons.</p> <p>Nick Hardwick, in his annual report, says there has been a general improvement in jail conditions, with many prisons responding positively to the government's \"rehabilitation revolution\", but progress has been uneven and is now under threat.</p> <p>He says progress, particularly on safety and providing a decent environment, appears to have stalled as the prison population has risen from 85,400 in March 2011 to 87,531 in March 2012.</p> <p>The chief inspector singles out conditions at Britain's largest prison, Wandsworth, which has a population of over 1,100, saying that its excellent workshop facilities were standing almost empty while inmates were locked in their cells for over 16hours a day when the jail was inspected.</p> <p>The chief inspector also says the growing abuse of prescription drugs behind bars, which has spread from high security jails to mainstream prisons, has become a major concern leading to drug debts, bullying, and the risk of overdose.</p> <p>He also highlights concern about the \"strikingly high\" number of prisoners from a traveller background. They make up almost one in 10 of those being held at Wormwood Scrubs in London and the number is frequently as high as 5% of the population in other jails.</p> <p>The chief inspector says, \"The issue is not how many prisoners can be squeezed into the available cells. The issue is whether there are the resources to hold all detainees safely and securely and do anything useful with them when they are there.\"</p> <p>\"Resources are now stretched very thinly. There is a risk of undermining the progress made in recent years. If a rehabilitation revolution is to be delivered, there is a clear choice for politicians and policy makers \u2013 reduce prison populations or increase prison budgets.\"</p> <p>National offender management service figures show the number of self-inflicted deaths in prison have risen from 54 in 2010-11 to 66 in 2011-12. They also show that incidents of self-harm also rose in men's prisons from 14,768 in 2010-11 to 16,146 this year, and the number of recorded assaults rose from 13,804 to 14,858 over the same period.</p> <p>The chief inspector said these figures were a matter of real concern.</p> <p>\"When we compared survey results for prisons inspected this year with those from their previous inspections, prisoners' perceptions of their safety had significantly worsened in twice as many prisons as those where they had significantly improved,\" said Hardwick.</p> <p>The chief inspector says the past year has seen a shift in emphasis in drug treatment in prisons away from long-term methadone maintenance towards a recovery-orientated treatment approach. This was working well in jails where prisoners were not pressurised to reduce their dosages, but was causing problems in those prisons where there was a non-individualised regime for opiate dose reduction.</p> <p>But at the same time there has been a rapid growth in the abuse of prescription drugs that are not detected under the current mandatory drug-testing regime. He said that \"diverted drugs\", often obtained by bullying or simply stolen from those for whom they were prescribed, were now a problem in the majority of prisons. Mandatory drug testing for the prescription drugs involved, including Tramadol, Gabapentin and Pregabalin, is being piloted.</p>",
  "<p>The number of people struggling to repay multiple payday loans has increased threefold in three years, according to a national debt advice charity.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cccs.co.uk/\" title=\"Consumer Credit Counselling Service website\">Consumer Credit Counselling Service</a> says 2,000 of its clients so far in 2012 have had five or more payday loans, compared to 716 for the whole of 2009. Of these, 173 had 10 or more loans compared to only 42 in 2009.</p> <p>Payday loans are short-term forms of borrowing \u2013 typically lasting no more than 30 days \u2013 usually offered at a very high cost. One payday lender called Microlend is charging a representative APR of 4,640%.</p> <p>It is easy for a borrower to take out multiple loans because few of the estimated 200 firms operating in the UK file details of customers and their borrowings with the credit reference agencies. This means that even if they check an applicant's credit record they may not be able to see all the loans the applicant already has, making it impossible to judge whether they can afford to make their repayments.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading, which is responsible for licencing payday lenders, is currently conducting an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/24/payday-loan-firms-investigated-oft\" title=\"Payday loan firms to be investigated by OFT\">extensive review of the payday lending sector</a> prompted by fears some lenders are taking advantage of people in financial difficulty.</p> <p>One of the issues under review, which has involved visits to 50 companies, including some in the US and Europe which lend to British customers, is whether firms are giving loans without first checking adequately that the borrower can afford to repay them.</p> <p>Delroy Corinaldi, CCCS external affairs director, said: \"Payday loans are not the cheapest form of credit, but some people find them useful and are able to repay what they owe at the end of the month. However, multiple payday loans can very quickly become unmanageable.</p> <p>\"Measures must be put in place to ensure more people don't find themselves in this situation, and the CCCS calls on the payday loan industry to address this issue urgently.\"</p> <p>Despite the high costs associated with payday loans, the CCCS has seen a rise in the number of people seeking help with them, rising from 6,491 in 2009 to 17,414 in 2011. So far in 2012, 16,467 people have contacted it for help with payday loans. The average amount owed by those seeking help has also risen, from \u00a31,187 in 2009 to \u00a31,458 in 2012.</p> <p>Richard Griffiths, spokesman for the payday lender trade association Consumer Finance Association, said the increase reflected the fast growing numbers of people using payday loans, although the body does not yet have up-to-date figures for how many loans are being issued by its members.</p>",
  "<p>The internet is facing increased threats from intervention that could stifle its unprecedented capacity for social and economic development.</p> <p>As a member of the <a href=\"http://www.iccwbo.org/\" title=\"\">International Chamber of Commerce</a> initiative <a href=\"http://www.iccwbo.org/advocacy-codes-and-rules/special-projects/basis/\" title=\"\">ICC Basis</a>, I firmly believe that governments must work in tandem with the business community to keep the web open for all companies and civil society to engage in legitimate activity, and to capitalise on the positive correlation between internet investment and economic growth.</p> <p>There is general agreement that governance structures should remain dispersed and multi-stakeholder, rather than top-down and controlled by governments. So what is at stake if the internet governance landscape isn't strengthened, and how much value is there in business working to protect the multi-stakeholder approach to the internet policy discussions?</p> <h2>Why improving the internet governance landscape matters to business </h2> <p>The internet was created from the bottom-up, a collaboration built by an \"open, decentralised, peer\", as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/the-internet-we-built-that.html?_r=1\" title=\"\">recently stressed by Steve Johnson in the New York Times</a>. Although initially backed by government financing, the internet was commercialised and enhanced by private corporations, and today, internet innovation derives primarily from business and individual entrepreneurs.</p> <p>It's paramount for discussion of internet governance to be similarly collaborative, with business stakeholders deeply involved in dialogue on all levels.</p> <p>But some governments might try to re-open prior agreements for a dramatic shift in the way the internet is governed in favour of an intergovernmental-led model which excludes or demotes other stakeholder groups and would threaten the openness which has defined the internet from the outset.</p> <p>To protect and preserve the economic and social opportunity made possible by internet investment and innovation, business considers it absolutely crucial that the debate about internet governance be transparent and open to all stakeholders. The internet is a powerful economic force; it has accounted for <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/the_great_transformer\" title=\"\">21% of the GDP growth in mature economies</a> over the past five years and, if internet consumption and expenditures were a sector, its weight in GDP would be <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/the_great_transformer\" title=\"\">bigger than the energy or agriculture industry</a>.</p> <p>So getting internet governance policy approaches right, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks, really matters for business growth and sustainability. It has a direct impact on job creation, economic development, trade and competitiveness \u2013 both for public and private companies, and spanning small to large enterprises. As such, it's key for global business to support policies that demand an open market robustly, to promote innovation and eliminate barriers facing companies looking to invest in new markets.</p> <p>Business itself has produced the innovations in network design and technology which have supported economic growth, and it's also a major \u2013 perhaps the largest \u2013 user of the internet. It's for these reasons that business interests should be at the heart of policy discussion, and why effective government-business co-operation provides the key to strengthening internet governance. The multi-stakeholder approach is a vital mechanism for achieving exactly this.</p> <h2>How the multi-stakeholder model can support business interests </h2> <p>There are a number of models being developed to try to address internet governance issues in fair, collaborative ways. In fact, many of the organisations and forums addressing internet-related issues and their decision-making processes are already multi-stakeholder, including the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (<a href=\"http://www.icann.org/\" title=\"\">ICANN</a>), and the Internet Governance Forum (<a href=\"http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/\" title=\"\">IGF</a>).</p> <p>In adopting this approach, these organisations are affirming the importance of bringing people together from various stakeholder groups as equals to discuss public policy regarding the internet.</p> <p>While the IGF, for example, does not negotiate an outcome, it enables those with policy-making power in both the public and private sectors to be part of an open exchange of information. It has also catalysed dozens of national and regional IGF initiatives.</p> <p>But the multi-stakeholder approach is not without controversy \u2013 both as a theory, and in terms of how it works in practice. As with any form of governance, it must address principles such as representation, transparency, efficiency, and its own level of democracy. Indeed multi-stakeholder institutions such as ICANN and the IGF are constantly seeking to improve their outreach to ensure active and meaningful participation by representatives from all groups \u2013 participants from developing countries, for example.</p> <p>Such representation is essential for this model to be successful, but in recent years we've been witnessing more and more direct affronts to multi-stakeholder governance, paving the way for governments to exercise far more control.</p> <p>This cannot be the alternative. If we want to protect and foster progressive governance, we need to reconsider and revive the concept and practice of multi-stakeholder governance. We should remember that the internet has been an unparalleled success story where a favourable internet governance environment has been the prerequisite for continued investment, innovation and development.</p> <h2>Participation as a foundation for business growth </h2> <p>For democratic governance, maintaining an open and transparent process that encourages participation from a diverse range of actors, including business, is paramount. Co-operation needs to be facilitated and promoted across the whole spectrum of organisations addressing internet-related issues, including those that are private sector-led, multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental. That's why the key to maintaining a robust internet for the future lies in continued enhanced co-operation, both between stakeholders and in business-government liaison \u2013 something which needs to become regularised.</p> <p>But for this interaction between stakeholders to be truly effective, we need to ensure sufficient engagement in the debate. Business has an important role to play in defining the shape of the Internet and our voice should be heard in policy-making discussions. The consequences of not speaking out could mean that changes to the way the internet is governed will not serve the interests of business in the long-term.</p> <p>Now, more than ever, is the time to enrich the debate over participation in internet governance and to highlight the importance of having a representative and inclusive process for debate and decision-making. This will be vital to protecting and promoting the free and open web which business has nurtured, and from which it has thrived.</p> <p><em>Jeff Brueggeman is vice-president public policy at </em><a href=\"http://www.att.com/\" title=\"\"><em>AT&amp;T </em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Last week, the British government <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-uk-gujarat-british-high-commissioner-in-india/1/224383.html\" title=\"\">asked its high commissioner in India to meet Narendra Modi</a>, ending 10 years of international isolation for Gujarat's chief minister. Modi was delighted, of course, immediately tweeting \"God is great\".</p> <p>His industries minister instantly promised to \"fast-track\" British investment projects. But many Indian political parties, including the ruling Congress, parties of the left, and Muslim organisations, have sharply criticised the decision. Ever since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\" title=\"\">massacre of more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in 2002</a>, Modi has been accused by jurists, secular political leaders and civil society in India, as well as by the governments of many countries, of taking no action to prevent the violence, delaying the deployment of police to protect victims and failing to investigate and punish those responsible for the killings. Despite his repeated denials of each of these accusations, Modi is a potent symbol of militant defiance of secularism and constitutional-democratic principles, and remains greatly feared by Muslims.</p> <p>The decision by the UK to resume contact with him is seen as a cruel blow to the causes of justice for the massacre's victims (which included three British citizens), and of non-discrimination against India's 180&#xa0;million non-Hindus.</p> <p>Up till now, British officials have followed a \"working policy\" of no contact with Modi's government <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-03-22/india/27849965_1_gujarat-riots-riot-act-uk\" title=\"\">\"because of our concerns over what happened in Gujarat\"</a>. Modi was also refused a visa by the US and EU. Modi's global isolation has helped to sustain domestic civil society pressure to bring the massacre's perpetrators to justice. This in turn encouraged the Indian supreme court to intervene, by asking the Gujarat government to reopen criminal cases closed for \"lack of evidence\", and transferring some trials to Maharashtra.</p> <p>The new British stand has been rationalised on the ground that it would allow the UK \"to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest and to explore opportunities for closer co-operation, in line with the \u2026 objective of improving bilateral relations \u2026\". In reality, it will deepen India's social and political rifts, and strengthen Modi's Hindu-chauvinist <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2218139/BJP-deny-Narendra-Modi-place.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">Bharatiya Janata party, for whose leadership</a> he is making an aggressive bid.</p> <p>Going by background briefings by British officials to the Indian press, the UK is attracted to \"dynamic and thriving\" opportunities in Gujarat, especially in \"business\", \"science\" and \"education\". Gujarat has emerged as a major investment destination thanks largely to the sweetheart deals Modi offers to businesses. Despite booming investments, Gujarat's social indices and poverty ratios remain appalling.</p> <p>Evidently, the Cameron government doesn't want to lose out on Gujarat's business opportunities or support from Britain's prosperous Gujarati businessmen, described by the Foreign Office as \"one of the most successful and dynamic communities in the UK\" \u2013 even if that means sanctifying large-scale violence. The Foreign Office lamely added that it wants \"to secure justice for the families of the British nationals who were killed \u2026 [and] support human rights and good governance \u2026\" That cannot be done by relaxing moral-political pressure on Modi.</p> <p>The 2002 massacre was conducted by Hindu fanatics, who speared and burnt Muslims to death, besides raping hundreds of women. Some particularly ghastly incidents were <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/india/\" title=\"\">documented by Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tehelka.com/story_main35.asp?filename=Ne031107gujrat_sec.asp\" title=\"\">an Indian magazine</a> . A witness told Human Rights Watch that the belly of a pregnant woman was slit open by a mob with swords, and both she and her foetus were torched. At Naroda-Patiya, 97 people were massacred, including 35 children and 32 women, by a mob directed by former minister and Modi confidante <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19432982\" title=\"\">Maya Kodnani</a>, who has just been sentenced to 28 years in jail. Police claim they recorded these cases but could not pursue them because of lack of evidence. This is contested by eye-witnesses.</p> <p>The collective barbaric vengeance against a religious minority couldn't have occurred, <a href=\"http://nhrc.nic.in/disparchive.asp?fno=247\" title=\"\">says India's National Human Rights Commission</a> , without \"a comprehensive failure on the part of the state government to control the persistent violation of the rights to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the people\". Although many more <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8306420.stm\" title=\"\">Sikhs were killed in Delhi after Indira Gandhi's assassination</a>, the state's involvement was far deeper in Gujarat, making it the worst massacre of its kind.</p> <p>The massacre followed riots, which were themselves a reaction to a fire in a train, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4180885.stm\" title=\"\">declared accidental by a railway inquiry</a>, in which 59 Hindus died. According to well-corroborated accounts, including some 40 independent reports, including one by the <a href=\"http://www.sabrang.com/tribunal\" title=\"\">Concerned Citizens Tribunal</a>, composed of former senior judges, Modi had the bodies of the train-fire victims brought over a long distance to Ahmedabad, and displayed in a procession. Unsurprisingly, this provoked violence in Gujarat's charged climate. Modi has denied this, saying that the bodies were taken to a hospital to avoid any tensions, and that the violence was simply a natural \"reaction\" to the train fire.</p> <p>According to independent accounts, denied officially, police stood by as the killing proceeded, and refused to register the crimes properly. The BJP, in power nationally, did not use the constitutional powers they have which could have helped restore confidence. (In India, if there is a breakdown of order in any state, the central government can sack the provincial government and impose its own rule until the situation improves and fresh elections can be held. In March 2002, a majority of Indian parties demanded that Modi be sacked and central rule imposed in Gujarat, but the BJP-led government refused.) Gujarat's climate has remained vitiated ever since, allowing Modi to win two state elections.</p> <p>Modi claims he's innocent and has never expressed remorse for the violence. <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gujarat-narendra-modi-reaches-out-to-muslims-nai-duniya/1/210468.html\" title=\"\">His recent overtures to Muslims</a> are viewed with suspicion.</p> <p>Despite official efforts to shield the culprits, and corrupt or destroy evidence, more than 110 people have been found guilty and sentenced by the courts \u2013 a small fraction of the culprits' number. Some evidence, as in Kodnani's case, was provided by conscientious policemen, including a detailed mobile-phone log that establishes frequent conversations between ministers, Hindu fanatics and police at specific sites.</p> <p>Gujarat's victims have still not received justice. Thousands haven't been rehabilitated. Large numbers have been driven into ghettoes, and effectively disenfranchised within a communally polarised climate. Without justice, there can be no reconciliation or forgiveness.</p> <p>Violence of this scale should be an international concern. It shouldn't be treated lightly simply because India has the trappings of a democracy with free elections. What makes the British decision politically odious is its timing: the Gujarat state election is just two months away.</p>",
  "<p>It is a measure of how bad things are on both sides of the Rhine when Fran\u00e7ois Hollande goes public on his exasperation with Angela Merkel.</p> <p>In his interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers, the French president delivered a catalogue of complaints about the German chancellor's prescriptions for resolving the euro crisis.</p> <p>There is nothing unusual about frictions and poor chemistry between French and German leaders, despite the entrenched, deeply embedded relationship that is much more \"special\" than fond British ideas of the transatlantic axis.</p> <p>Merkel and Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, worked together, but were scathing about one another in private. Every Franco-German couple going back to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/adenauer_konrad.shtml\" title=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/adenauer_konrad.shtml\">Konrad Adenauer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/charles-de-gaulle\" title=\"\">Charles de Gaulle</a> displayed similar symptoms of being caught in a love-hate affair. But they kept it private.</p> <p>The usual pattern for these big EU summits is that Berlin and Paris get together on the eve of the meeting and deliver a common position that forms the basis for a summit deal.</p> <p>Things could hardly be more different this time. The French leader has delivered a salvo of criticisms at the Germans just before the EU's leaders gather in Brussels for the first time since June.</p> <p>The French leader's move is bold and all the more unexpected for being so public. It's also risky. He clearly feels Merkel is not listening to him and other key crisis leaders, such as Mario Monti in Italy or Mariano Rajoy in Spain. He also seems to be blaming Berlin for 30 months of prevarication and dithering on the crisis, wasting a lot of time, and then disguising its reluctance to act by presenting grandiose ambitious schemes for the EU that would take a decade to realise.</p> <p>These criticisms of Merkel are common currency in Brussels and the capitals of the EU. But they acquire a new weight when delivered in public from the Elys\u00e9e Palace. There are many who will cheer, and not only in Athens, Madrid or Rome.</p> <p>Recession is the bigger problem, not budget deficits and debt, Hollande contends. Enough austerity, it is killing rather than curing. German attacks on the European Central Bank because of its new interventionism are misplaced and wrong, the French leader charges. Germany, too, can help to rebalance the European economy by boosting domestic demand through pay rises and tax cuts, he adds.</p> <p>Many will applaud this diagnosis.</p> <p>But there is also a very French agenda, also pursued by Sarkozy, behind some of Hollande's proposals, notably on how to run the eurozone. He wants national leaders to take control through monthly summits of the 17 presidents, chancellors or prime ministers and the eurogroup of 17 finance ministers to be beefed up.</p> <p>In other words, powers and decision-taking should be left to national leaders, inevitably producing stitch-ups of the kind that have failed in the past. It is about avoiding giving new powers to Brussels over national economic policymaking and tempering the German-led push for enforcing fiscal disciplines, including automatic penalties for recalcitrants, policed by the European commission.</p> <p>Running the eurozone through a council of national leaders would also enhance French clout as France would be backed by the zone's third and fourth economies, Italy and Spain, while Germany's allies would be smaller.</p> <p>This move will annoy Brussels, but also smaller eurozone countries such as the Dutch, fearing the big countries will run things and overrule them. That was the trouble with the Merkel-Sarkozy arrangement.</p> <p>Hollande's position is both strong and weak. There is the inherent strength of being a newly elected president of France. But he oversees a sclerotic economy that every month is forfeiting its competitiveness and widening the performance gap with Germany following years of failure by all French leaders to reform. If he can tackle these taboos and turn that record around, he will be in a much stronger position vis-\u00e0-vis Berlin.</p> <p>But his appeal and his warning demonstrate he is not backing down in the argument with Germany about how to make Europe fit for the future. He is also looking for a new deal with Merkel. Without that compromise, Europe's worst ever crisis will get worse yet.</p>",
  "<p>Two claims management firms have been told to change their advertising after overstating how difficult it would be for consumers to reclaim payment protection insurance (PPI) premiums from banks and building societies.</p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ordered the companies, Gladstone Brookes and Consumer Finance Claims, to alter adverts which suggested reclaiming PPI was a lengthy process and that consumers had more chance of success if they used a claims management company.</p> <p>Claims management companies offer to take cases against lenders on consumers' behalf, usually on a no-win no-fee basis.

But the governing body is likely to face renewed criticism over the fact the matter will not be considered until its disciplinary panel next meets on November 22.</p> <p>As the Serbian FA said it \"absolutely refuses and denies that there were any occurrences of racism\", despite loud monkey noises being clearly audible at the final whistle, the country's prime minister Ivica Dacic, who is also Serbia's police chief, risked infuriating the situation further after reportedly claiming that all those who took part in scuffles on the pitch in Krusevac should be identified and \"brought to justice\".</p> <p>The FA general secretary, Alex Horne, said the events of Tuesday night had led it to \"question the validity of sending a team to Serbia in the future\".</p> <p>\"We were shocked and appalled by the disgraceful events that occurred in Serbia,\" Horne said. \"Our players and staff were subjected to racial abuse, violence as well as missiles being thrown at them throughout the match. What occurred is inexcusable and not acceptable.\"</p> <p>On Wednesday night the FA presented a formal complaint to Uefa cataloguing \"numerous instances of violence and abuse\" Racist abuse was aimed at England's black players throughout the match, and was reported to the referee at half-time along with evidence of missiles being thrown, before reaching a climax at full time as the game dissolved into chaos following Connor Wickham's last-minute goal and the final whistle.</p> <p>Danny Rose, the Tottenham full-back who is on loan at Sunderland, was sent off after eventually reacting to the abuse by kicking the ball into the crowd. The Serbian FA said his behaviour towards supporters was \"inappropriate, unsportsmanlike and vulgar\" but Rose said he had been targeted from the warm-up onwards. \"The first half was no way near as bad as the second half. I had two stones hit me in the head when I went to get the ball for a throw-in. Every time I touched the ball I heard monkey chants,\" he said.</p> <p>While apologising for the ugly scenes at the final whistle, when Serbian players and staff attacked their English opposite numbers, the Serbian FA denied there had been any racism. \"Making connection between the seen incident \u2013 a fight between members of the two teams \u2013 and racism has absolutely no ground and we consider it to be a total malevolence,\" said the Serbian FA, which claimed the entire match had been played in a \"sports atmosphere full of respecting fair play spirit\".</p> <p>The FA and sports minister Hugh Robertson have written to Uefa, which next week will feature anti-racism messages before Champions League ties as part of a \"week of action\", calling for the strongest possible sanctions. Players and anti-racism campaigners said that only a ban for Serbia would suffice.</p> <p>Robertson said: \"The scenes at the end of the game were disgraceful. I have written to Uefa president Michel Platini, in support of the FA, urging them to investigate immediately. Racism in any form is unacceptable and must be stamped out. We would expect tough sanctions from Uefa on anyone found guilty of racist abuse.\" The prime minister, David Cameron, was said to be \"appalled\" by the ugly scenes. \"We are determined to stamp out racism internationally and at home and we are giving our full backing to the FA's complaint on this issue,\" said his spokesman.</p> <p>The FA's complaint outlined in detail the racist chanting, which was heard in isolated pockets during the match before reaching a peak at the end, as well as the missiles hurled on to the pitch from the stands and unprovoked attacks on players and coaching staff at the final whistle. It is believed that the Uefa delegate was hit by a missile from the crowd during the match, and the goalkeeper Jack Butland was targeted by lighters, coins and seats thrown from the stands. The scenes at the end of the match were described as \"unprecedented\" by those present. The Serbian staff were unapologetic afterwards, apart from the former Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic, present as a match delegate, who is believed to have apologised to the manager Stuart Pearce.</p> <p>Lord Ouseley, the chair of Kick It Out, joined calls for \"serial offenders\" Serbia to be banned from international competition. \"The fact Uefa has been so woefully weak in the past in administering punishments makes it easy to reoffend,\" he said. \"The jury is out on Uefa's capacity and willingness to tackle racism on the scale necessary. If they don't do what is appropriate in this instance, everyone will lose confidence in Uefa.\"</p> <p>Ouseley, who has spearheaded attempts to drive racism out of British football grounds, said that not only was Uefa imposing insufficient punishments but was failing to be \"proactive\" in working to change attitudes.</p> <p>\"Personally speaking, I think they have to take a stand and throw teams out of competitions. They have to take action against Serbia. It is a serial offender \u2013 it doesn't control its fans, its players or its officials,\" he said.</p> <p>Clarke Carlisle, the chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, also called for Serbia to be thrown out of international competition. Others, including Phil Neville, called on players to take matters into their own hands and leave the pitch when subjected to racist chanting.</p> <p>In 2007, the Serbian FA was fined \u00a316,500 following misconduct by fans and players in another European Under-21 Championship match against England. Serbian fans were heard making monkey chants at England's black players, leading the referee to hold up the match while an announcement was made over the stadium's public address system. Trouble then broke out between the two sets of players as they left the pitch, with the English FA later saying there had been further racist abuse from Serbian players. The issue is a sensitive one for Uefa, roundly criticised for its derisory fines after previous allegations of racism, which claims to have a \"zero tolerance\" policy on the matter. Following a meeting of its executive committee in December 2005 it said tackling racism was a \"top priority\" and recognised \"that racism and discrimination have their roots in society but are often articulated through our sport\".</p>",
  "<p>Specialist social work aimed at helping at-risk families turn their lives around and avoid having their children taken into care is being dismantled by cuts and overwhelmed by soaring child neglect and family stress, a study has found.</p> <p>Local authorities' children's services are increasingly forced to concentrate their depleted resources on crisis interventions \u2013 such as child protection plans, residential care and foster services \u2013 at the expense of family support, early years projects and youth clubs.</p> <p>The erosion or closure of \"lighter touch\" preventive social services is happening despite the government's apparent commitment to early intervention, the <a href=\"http://www.familyandparenting.org/our_work/Families-in-the-Age-of-Austerity/Families+at+the+frontline\">detailed study by the Family and Parenting Institute (FPI)</a> concludes. It says this \"may well prove to be a false economy\" because without help more vulnerable families may end up needing expensive acute services such as child protection.</p> <p>The study found that demand for social work crisis services spiralled during two years of austerity, and that councils were struggling to manage. One unidentified council in the FPI study reported a 70% increase in referrals to children's social care in 18 months, alongside a 50% rise in child protection cases and soaring numbers of children being taken into care.</p> <p>Another local authority reported a 5% increase in numbers of children going into foster care over the past two years.</p> <p>The cost of funding rising pressures on emergency crisis intervention services was put at \u00a33m by one council children's services department, at a time when it had to find cuts of \u00a320m.</p> <p>This \"intensification of needs\" was not just apparent in traditionally poor communities, one council reported, but also among families in more affluent neighbourhoods. This phenomenon, of social care services intervening in better-off families, was triggered by problems arising because \"parents cannot afford to separate due to inflation, wage stagnation and exorbitant housing costs\".</p> <p>The report's authors emphasised that this example of increased social services need in affluent neighbourhoods was anecdotal and there was no hard evidence that it had become more prevalent or widespread.</p> <p>Katherine Rake, chief executive of the FPI, said the study showed some cuts were storing up costly problems&#xa0;for the future. \"'Lighter touch' universal services are perhaps an obvious target for short-term savings, but in practice this will only limit ability to intervene earlier, and more cost-effectively, with families.\"</p> <p>Cuts mean children's services will in future cease to be universal but instead be increasingly tightly targeted at \"troubled families\" and children in the criminal justice system, the report says. It adds that managing those cuts will become harder. \"There is little scope for introducing yet more efficiency measures that will not directly impact on the frontline or on services for the most vulnerable.\"</p> <p>Eight local authority children's departments across four English regions were studied for the report. Five of the councils had above-average levels of deprivation, and the remainder below-average. Four were Conservative-controlled, three Labour and one had no overall control.</p> <p>The study was completed before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/27/free-nursery-places-funded-sure-start\" title=\"\">news emerged last month</a> of the government's intention to abolish the \u00a32.3bn early intervention grant allocated to councils in England. Councils have warned that this could lead to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2012/oct/09/sure-start-confusion-over-cuts-nursery-care\" title=\"\">further cuts of up to 20%</a> in funding for early years and family work from next April.</p> <p>The FPI report echoes the findings of the <a href=\"http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/media/4342584/red_book_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">Red Book 2012 report</a> by the charity Action for Children, which runs hundreds of children's centres and family support schemes across the UK. Its survey of nearly a third of its frontline managers, published this week, found there had been an increase in the number of vulnerable families \"on the brink\" over the past 12 months as a result of welfare cuts and unemployment.</p> <p>Almost two in three families it worked with were facing more severe problems with issues such as neglect, deprivation and mental health than they were at this time last year, the report found. The numbers of staff reporting cases of suspected child neglect had risen by 14%.</p> <p>A funding squeeze meant Action for Children staff found themselves increasingly forced to focus on crisis intervention work rather than offering preventive services to families who were merely under pressure, it said.</p> <p>Action for Children's chief executive, Dame Clare Tickell, said: \"We welcome the coalition government's commitment to early intervention but the current system of short-term, quick-fix funding is simply exacerbating existing need and instability, creating a false economy that could cost society more than \u00a31.3bn a year.\"</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Local authorities have complete freedom over their budgets to target vulnerable children and families in their areas. As this report shows the most innovative LAs are thinking creatively about how best to use their resources \u2013 and making sensible changes - so they can continue to provide much needed services for families in a more efficient way. </p> <p>\"We are increasing funding for early intervention to \u00a32.5bn in 2014-15 and are retaining a national network of Sure Start centres - with 3,330 currently open in the areas where they are needed most. We are also extending free early years education and helping parents with childcare costs whilst they look for jobs.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>Human rights lawyer Baroness Helena Kennedy QC became the first female co-chair of the <a href=\"http://www.ibanet.org/IBAHRI.aspx\">International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute</a> earlier this year. </em></p> <p>In the early 70s, there was no such thing as sexual discrimination legislation. Instead, men explicitly said, \"We don't take women on here.\" This was what it was like in chambers in 1972 when I was starting out. Male lawyers felt it was not a good investment to hire women, because they'd just go off and have babies. So when I was 24 years old, I set up my own chambers with a group of five other young lawyers. We weren't there to make money. We went into the law for a purpose, to fight for social justice. </p> <p>I was disadvantaged on many fronts when I entered the law. I come from a working class background - my father and mother left school at the ages of 14 and 13 - so I had no connections, and I was a woman. I was an outsider. I was the first in my family to go into higher education. But my mother never let me get too big for my boots.</p> <p>As a young lawyer, there were very few females to look up to. I got the sense from those that were there that they rather enjoyed being the rare woman in a man's world. I hate seeing an unwillingness in women to make themselves available to their own gender.

There was a time when the lunch was only for women in hats of a certain class. But now it's a real celebration of women of all backgrounds who have done incredible things.

You need to be able to empathise with your client, get them to open up, so you know what it's like to be in their shoes and are able to fight their case properly. But you also have to create enough distance so that you're not incapable of making sensible judgements. </p> <p>The difference in the way that the law treats women now is incredible compared to how it used to be. In the past, when you represented a woman who had been abused, the court used to say it didn't want to know about her past, it only wanted to judge her on the present. But if you don't contextualise a woman's history of abuse, then she will simply not get justice. It was a real battle to be allowed to present experts in court, who could explain the psychological impact that years of abuse would have on a woman. </p> <p>Now, we are over these big hurdles, but there's a lot that remains. Police forces are told to be alert to domestic abuse cases, but they still don't hear what women are saying. Women try to alert the authorities, try to tell them an ex-husband is calling and threatening them, but the authorities don't listen and those women end up dead. We want to bring actions against police forces for these failures. That's the way we can bring real change. Our struggles are not over.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Women of the Year Lunch 2012, which celebrates women's achivevements, takes place on 22 October, <a href=\"http://www.womenoftheyear.co.uk/\">womenoftheyear.co.uk</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>The UK weather is turning nastier, with warnings of floods and gales, after a relatively quiet anniversary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2012/oct/15/forecasters-great-storm-1987-gales\" title=\"\">1987's Great Storm</a>.</p> <p>The Meteorological Office and the Environment Agency have joined forces to alert people in the south-west of England and south Wales to the possibility of coastal tide surges and an upgrade to 25 flood warnings already in place.</p> <p>The harbourmaster in Looe, south Cornwall, said the flooding affecting properties close to the sea was the worst he had seen in the seven years he had been there.</p> <p>Jeff Penhaligon said the water had subsided after Wednesday morning's high tide but the village was now preparing itself for the next one, at about 8pm.</p> <p>\"It's difficult to see exactly who's been affected but I think it's some of the businesses and restaurants near the harbour. It all depends whether people were able to get their storm boards up.\" Penhaligon said no fishing boats had gone out on Wednesday.</p> <p>Transport could be seriously disrupted in exposed areas, according to the two agencies, following an overnight check on flood defences. People have been warned to stay away from beaches to avoid being swept away by sudden sea surges or hit by flotsam and jetsam flung up by waves.</p> <p>Emergency services praised two brothers from Newquay and Perranporth in Cornwall for saving a woman on Little Fistral beach after she was swept out to sea while trying to rescue her dog. The men swam through waves two metres high with a lifebelt and kept her afloat until the inshore lifeboat arrived.</p> <p>Gareth Horner, volunteer lifeboat operations manager at Newquay, said: \"Their action deserves the fullest praise. Their swift response, coupled with their training, ensured they were able to reach the woman quickly and safely and provide her with vital support until the lifeboat crew arrived.\"</p> <p>The Ship Inn and a number of neighbouring businesses in Mevagissey were flooded overnight and the morning Scillonian ferry service between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly was cancelled because of stormy seas. Trains between Liskeard and Looe were stopped by flooding on the line and there was minor flooding at Paignton and Bideford in Devon.</p> <p>There were protests in Weston-super-Mare on the Somerset coast after flooding hit shops and restaurants following a tidal surge. Warnings did not reach the area in time for the storm gates to be closed on a new \u00a329m protection system.</p> <p>Further gusts of up to 60mph are likely along the shorelines of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and south Wales, according to the Met Office, which has severe weather warnings at its third most serious \u2013 yellow \u2013 level for the region, as well as further north to Anglesey and the south-west coastal area of Scotland.</p> <p>The Met Office forecast for Wednesday says: \"Generally windy, with gales around exposed western coasts. Persistent, locally heavy rain in northern England and Northern Ireland, moving into Scotland. Elsewhere, sunny spells and showers, some heavy, and with a chance of more persistent rain in the far south-east.\"</p> <p>Windy weather will continue through Wednesday night in the south-west while the north and west are likely to get the worst of renewed rain. The pattern continues in a gentler form until the weekend and the best bet for next week is unsettled, albeit calmer and drier.</p> <p>Gemma Plumb, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said 60mph gusts were most likely on the south Wales coast throughout the windy spell, while in Devon and Cornwall they would be between 40mph and 55mph. The Environment Agency said sea surges were likely through a combination of strong westerly winds and some of the highest tides of the year following the autumn equinox.</p> <p>The agency has posted 28 flood warnings, its second highest level, 17 in the south-west, nine in Wales, one at Bosham and Itchenor on the south-east coast and one on the Silloth and Workington stretches of the Cumbrian coast. There are also 78 flood alerts, the lowest level of warning, 27 in the south-west, 10 in Wales, 20 in the south-east, nine in the north-west, six in the north-east, two in the Midlands and four in East Anglia.</p>",
  "<p>Freshers Week is over for another year \u2013 and not a day too soon. I am not the biggest fan.</p> <p>However, I would not go so far as to say that it is a waste of time either. Let me explain. I am a second-year student, a Muslim from one of the Gulf states. I did Freshers Week last year, embracing something of a go-hard-or-go-home strategy that would probably have landed me in deep, deep trouble back home.</p> <p>If I had to summarise that week in a sentence? Alcohol-fuelled sweat-fest of over-sexualised teenagers.</p> <p>One year on, I still cringe at having gone to one of the dodgy student clubs in London's Piccadilly the first night (note: never again). I was sober: the crush of glistening bodies and the wandering hands of strangers were completely revolting \u2013 but this, apparently, was \"freshers\", and I was determined to enjoy it.</p> <p>I had started the week with admittedly unrealistic ideas of meeting lots of new people and dancing the night away. Oh, how those hopes were dashed. From (not taking part in) pre-lashing to telling the guy I'd danced with all night that I was going home now, without him, Freshers Week was disgusting. Having done it once, I would not do (and have not done) anything like it again. It purports to help new students make friends and have fun; it grossly under-delivers.</p> <p>To me, it felt like Freshers Week catered to a very specific group of students: you needed to be very drunk, you needed to be willing to let (very) loose and you needed to accept the fact that it was the company around you (rather than whatever dump of a venue had been chosen) that made your night fun. Never mind that said company were so intoxicated that there was no way they would remember you, or themselves, or any part of the night, the next morning.</p> <p>So why would I argue that these events are worth keeping?</p> <p>Freshers Week brought my first-ever clubbing experience. I had never been around so much alcohol \u2013 or so many cute guys before. I was presented with a flood of morally challenging temptations. Freshers Week tested my beliefs: by choosing to do certain things and refrain from others, I began to clarify what I really believed in \u2013 and, because of that, I have become a more mature person.</p> <p>Somewhere along the way, for example, I decided that I was not a fan of drinking. To me, the \"I-don't-drink-because-I'm-Muslim\" argument was weak. Let's face it, being in a club and dancing with an attractive guy were not exactly sanctioned by my religion either, but I was doing (and enjoying) them both.</p> <p>Freshers Week forced me to consider the underlying reasons for my sobriety: I did not like the taste of alcohol, it was a calorific investment I was not willing to make, and I did not need to drink to relax and have fun.</p> <p>Freshers Week also forced me to consider, defend to others and justify to myself, such standpoints as why I think it is okay to go out clubbing but not okay to sleep with a stranger (no matter how fit he is).</p> <p>So, while I wouldn't take part in such a thing ever again, I am glad I did it the first time around. Thrust into an environment that was beyond wild, I learned quickly what my boundaries were, what I believed in and why, and how to defend my beliefs.</p> <p>Could there have been other, less messy ways of learning those lessons? Probably. But at least this way, I could also show off to my friends back home, most of whom had chosen to study in North America, that I truly had experienced \"the London life\".</p> <p>\u2022 Alia Malouf (not her real name) is a law student at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

His 1966 regional hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W1iA2g2RUg\" title=\"\">You're Gonna Miss Me</a> has taken on international cult status as the first true psychedelic rock 45: a bona-fide acid trip preserved on vinyl. Though Erickson almost lost it all as a result of the excesses of the 1960s, interest in his music has been rekindled by vocal admirers \u2013 from ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons to Okkervil River's Will Sheff and indie rock band Black Angels.</p> <h2>Stevie Ray Vaughan \u2013 Cold Shot </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vQxxBGb2uSE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vQxxBGb2uSE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>For years, Austinites didn't really notice Little Stevie \u2013 he was just another hotshot kid playing six-string in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Street_(Austin,_Texas)\" title=\"\">6th Street</a> blues bands. But when David Bowie singled out the Texas guitar slinger for his Let's Dance sessions, the world took notice. Stevie Ray Vaughan \u2013 and Austin music \u2013 would never be the same again. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQxxBGb2uSE\" title=\"\">Cold Shot</a>, written by members of the long-forgotten Austin blues group Triple Threat, was SRV's tip of the hat to the local scene where he cut his chops.

Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q37rSz6JVVk\" title=\"\">London Homesick Blues</a> was the opening song on <a href=\"http://austincitylimits.com\" title=\"\">Austin City Limits</a>, the longest-running music show on American TV. The line in the chorus, \"I wanna go home with the Armadillo\", was long thought to be a reference to the world-famous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuijBpTVvD0\" title=\"\">Armadillo World Headquarters </a>music hall, where the rednecks and the hippies first joined forces in the 1970s. Nunn later confessed that he wasn't even thinking of Austin when he wrote this song. But don't tell the locals. They still whoop and holler whenever it's played.</p> <h2>Spoon \u2013 Sister Jack </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y8M24F5LUYc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y8M24F5LUYc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Few indie bands fall into that rarefied critical space occupied by the likes of Radiohead \u2013 but incredibly, Austin is the birthplace of just such a group. Over the years, Spoon's jagged alt-rock gelled into a thinking-person's hard rock, equal parts quirky and accessible. Though the creative metamorphosis continues (Britt Daniel's new side project, <a href=\"http://divinefits.com/\" title=\"\">Divine Fits</a> notwithstanding), <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8M24F5LUYc\" title=\"\">Sister Jack</a> from Spoon's 2005 album Gimme Fiction best captures the thrill of the ascent, bristling with guitar hooks dissolving into an electronic frenzy to a steady big rock rhythm. If there's a better song for a cruise down South Congress on a summer night with the sunroof open ... get back to me.</p> <h2>Alejandro Escovedo \u2013 Always a Friend</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AVuu9aJXp9E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AVuu9aJXp9E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Though Alejandro is one of the kings of Americana roots music, he's a rocker at heart. On this standout track from his critically acclaimed album Real Animal, Escovedo's swagger here is one of a Texas Springsteen in rolled-up sleeves, pounding away at a Telecaster and inviting the world to sing along (indeed, The Boss invited Escovedo on stage to perform <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVuu9aJXp9E\" title=\"\">Always a Friend</a> during a recent Houston concert and played on Alejandro's latest album). It's always a treat to catch one of Austin's premier artists burning down a place like the <a href=\"http://www.continentalclub.com\" title=\"\">Continental Club</a>, but hearing this song blasting over the loudspeakers at an airport on the other side of the world is enough to make any Austinite a little homesick \u2013 and proud.</p> <h2>Okkervil River \u2013 Lost Coastlines</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QZGYaghnkyI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QZGYaghnkyI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In <a href=\"http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Guides/RedRiver\" title=\"\">Austin's Red River music district</a>, skinny jeans and ironic tees were cool way before music bloggers got obsessed with Brooklyn. Okkervil River certainly paid their dues along Red River \u2013 but their rise to national prominence owes far less to fashion than to a reputation for literate lyrics and smart pop culture references imbedded in indelible melodies. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZGYaghnkyI\" title=\"\">Lost Coastlines</a> is a case in point: cosmopolitan college-town rock that's graduated to the big time \u2026 with barely a trace of a Texas accent.</p> <h2>Willie Nelson \u2013 Shotgun Willie</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vsw5D3C071M?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vsw5D3C071M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It's hard to convey what a shock it was for buttoned-down 1970s-era record company execs in Nashville to have heard the line, \"Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear\". Nelson had been a mainstay of the country music world, penning classics like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-wJNpWgss8\" title=\"\">Crazy</a> for the likes of Patsy Cline. But <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsw5D3C071M\" title=\"\">Shotgun Willie </a>was a musical declaration of independence: Nelson grew his hair out, draped a bandanna around his head and, with a joint burning somewhere in the background, he proceeded to give the virtual finger to the country music establishment. Better yet, he did it with a gentle smile. Willie didn't just reinvent himself, he reinvented a genre of music \u2013 indeed, a whole \"do your own thing\" ethos that defines the Austin attitude to this day.</p> <h2>Grupo Fantasma \u2013 Gimme Some</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JwT5bUZm2a4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JwT5bUZm2a4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Grupo Fantasma takes Tex-Mex to a whole 'nuther level, effortlessly mixing uptown Houston funk with bouncing <em>cumbias</em> straight outta Laredo (literally \u2013 that's where many of the band members grew up). With a roaring horn section, it's little surprise Prince brought the group into his fold as a backing band a few years back. But in Austin, Grupo commands top billing with shows that become instant cross-cultural dance parties. Brush up on your Spanglish, or just give in to the funk.

  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, has warned for the first time that the Paris-Berlin motor driving Europe could stall over deep differences on how to resolve the euro crisis, insisting on a climbdown by Angela Merkel in her emphasis on austerity and the surrender of national powers to tighten fiscal discipline.</p> <p>Giving the Guardian his first British newspaper interview since becoming president in May, Hollande said there was light at the end of the eurozone tunnel, but he also:</p> <p>\u2022 suggested Merkel was too preoccupied with domestic politics in her response to the crisis</p> <p>\u2022 demanded Berlin reverse its opposition to decisions taken by eurozone leaders in June</p> <p>\u2022 called on the eurozone to act promptly to bring down the costs of borrowing for Spain and Italy</p> <p>\u2022 insisted Greece be assured of staying in the eurozone</p> <p>\u2022 gave short shrift to a German push for the creation of a federalised eurozone or political union</p> <p>\u2022 and dismissed as unfounded the strong German criticisms of the recent moves on the crisis by the European Central Bank.</p> <p>While the Franco-German relationship was the driving and \"accelerating\" force of the EU, Hollande said, \"it can also be the brake if it's not in step. Hence the need for Franco-German coherence.\"</p> <p>Hollande's remarks on the eve of a crucial EU summit in Brussels highlighted the extent of the gulf between Paris and Berlin and the deep divisions within the eurozone almost three years into Europe's worst ever crisis.</p> <h2>Solidarit\u00e9</h2> <p>Interviewed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/europa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the Guardian and five other European newspapers</a> from France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland, Hollande also called for monthly meetings of the national leaders of the 17 eurozone countries to end the cycle of \"so-called 'last-chance' summits\", which he said in the past had led only to \"fleeting successes\".</p> <p>He said domestic electoral considerations should not get in the way of solving the euro-crisis. Merkel \"is very sensitive to questions of internal politics and to the demands of her parliament. I understand that, and can respect that. But we all have our own public opinion. Our common responsibility is to put Europe's interests first.\"</p> <p>France's first socialist president for 17 years also rejected the idea that Germany was the only nation putting its hand in its pocket for everyone else.</p> <p>\"We're all taking part in this solidarity. The French, the Germans, just like all the Europeans in the ESM [the eurozone's new rescue fund]. Let's stop thinking that there's only one country who's going to pay for the others. That's false. However, I know the sensitivity of our German friends to the problem of supervision. Whoever pays should control, whoever pays should sanction. I agree. But budgetary union should be completed by a partial mutualisation of debts through eurobonds.\"</p> <p>Hollande's assertion of the need for the eurozone to pool some of its debt through eurobonds challenged one of Merkel's red lines. She has repeatedly refused to countenance the proposal and there is scant chance of her shifting that position as she moves into an election year.</p> <p>\"We are near, very near, to an end to the eurozone crisis,\" said Hollande. But decisions taken at the last EU summit in June had to be implemented \"as fast as possible\".</p> <h2>No Grexit</h2> <p>In June, EU leaders delivered a breakthrough deal, agreeing to make the European Central Bank the first supervisor of the eurozone's banks and to use the bailout funds to shore up weak banks directly rather than by lending the funds to governments. But Berlin is dragging its heels on the deal and last month shattered the confidence of its partners by walking away from the agreement.</p> <p>Hollande insisted that the so-called \"banking union\" had to be finalised by the end of the year. He is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/14/europe-franco-german-tussle-brussels?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">demanding a German climbdown</a> on the issue at the summit on Thursday and Friday.</p> <p>Echoing calls by the Spanish and Italian governments for German support to bring down the costs of their borrowing in the bond markets, Hollande said they should be able to finance themselves at \"reasonable\" rates, and added it was unfair some eurozone countries were borrowing at 1% and others at 7%.</p> <p>The Greek situation had to be dealt with \"definitively\" as \"Greece has made so much effort and it must now be assured of staying in the eurozone\".</p> <p>\"In the interests of all you can't inflict perpetual punishment on countries that have already made considerable efforts,\" he said.</p> <p>For Hollande, the urgency of dealing with the crisis had to take priority over longer-term German-led calls for eurozone federation and political union. Only once immediate measures were taken could Europe look at changing its way of decision-making and \"deepening its union\". He suggested that political union \u2013 so dear to the Germans \u2013 would be on the backburner until after the 2014 European parliament elections.</p> <p>Crucially, he warned against the issue of political union being used as a distraction to dodge difficult choices.</p> <p>\"The institutional issue is often evoked in order to avoid making choices. It hasn't escaped my notice that those quickest to talk of political union were often those the most reticent to take urgent decisions&#xa0;\u2026\"</p> <p>Challenged that he specifically meant the Germans, he said: \"No, I'm not pointing at anyone in particular.\" But he added: \"Several times in the past, they [Germany] had sincerely made proposals on political union. Those were not picked up.\"</p> <h2>Read my lips: no new treaty</h2> <p>Outlining his recipe for tackling the crisis, Hollande called on Germany to help rebalance the eurozone economy by cutting taxes and raising wages to spur domestic demand and proposed policies sharply at variance with Berlin in terms of timing and sequencing.</p> <p>\"Solidarity\" had to come first followed by deeper integration, he emphasised. \"Whenever we take a step towards solidarity, the union \u2013 which means the respect of common rules around governance \u2013 should progress.\" He said the banking union was a very important role. \"That solidarity can't go without democratic control. The banking union aimed at controlling finance would be an important step in European integration.\"</p> <p>The German strategy, by contrast, is to insist on tighter, centralised controls of budgets and fiscal policies and then to move towards a pooling of liabilities for banks and debt once the new system is operational and seen to be working.</p> <p>Asked whether in order for a more integrated political union it might be necessary to draw up a new European treaty and put it to referendums, Hollande shot back with a reference to the no vote on the European constitution in France in 2005. \"If I remember rightly, we tried that formula in 2005 and it didn't produce the results we were hoping for. Because before launching into institutional mechanics, Europeans must know what they want to do together. The content is more important than the framework,\" he said.</p> <p>He insisted France would \"tirelessly\" champion the growth agenda \u2013 \"this compromise between getting out of debt and growth\" \u2013 without questioning the need for budget discipline, which had been made \"absolutely necessary\" by the sovereign debt crisis. \"Today, recession is as big a threat as deficits.\"</p> <h2>Brits on the backfoot</h2> <p>Hollande said his approach was \"a Europe that advances at varying speeds, with different circles. We could call them 'avant garde', 'precursor states', the 'core' \u2013 names don't matter, it's the idea that counts.\" This meant strengthening the regular meetings of eurozone governments.</p> <p>. He said the leaders of other countries intending to join the single currency could also take part in his proposed monthly summits of eurozone national leaders, but on less than equal terms, as \"associates\". But, in an implicit nod to David Cameron and other non-euro zone countries not to interfere if they were standing outside, he added: \"Certain countries don't want to join [the eurozone]: that's their choice. But why should they come telling us how the eurozone should be run? It's a pretension I hear but that I don't think meets the need for coherence.\"</p> <p>Asked if he would risk seeing Britain leave Europe, Hollande said: \"I would like a UK fully engaged in Europe, but I can't decide in place of the British. I see that for the moment they want to be more in retreat. The British are tied by the accords they have signed up to. They can't detach from them. At least they have the merit of clarity. They aren't in the eurozone or budgetary union. I don't intend to force them.\"</p> <p>The suggestion that Britain couldn't wriggle out of deals it had signed up to could be seen in London as a signal that it would not be easy for the UK to renegotiate binding European commitments in a way Cameron would like to.</p> <p>Asked what was the biggest threat to the European Union, Hollande suggested it was \"not being loved. Only being seen at best as an austere cash dispenser or at worse as a reform school.\"</p> <p>In a message to Germany that France would stand by the others, he said. \"France is the bridge between northern Europe and southern Europe. I refuse any division. If Europe has been reunified, it's not for it to then fall into egotism or 'each for one's own'. Our duty is to set common rules around the principles of responsibility and solidarity. As a French person, it's for me to ensure Europeans are conscious of belonging to the same group.\"</p> <p>Asked if he had said that to Angela Merkel, he said: \"She knows it perfectly. That was the meaning of her trip to Athens\".</p> <p>He said: \"I'll do everything for Greece to stay in the euro and have the resources it needs by the end of the year, without it having to be necessary to inflict new conditions other than these already admitted by the Samaras government.\" But Hollande said he also felt for the Spanish and Portuguese people \"who had paid dear for others' excesses\".</p> <p>\"The time has come to offer a perspective beyond austerity\". He said Spain must know the precise conditions for getting financing agreed in June. There was no reason to make its burden heavier.</p> <p>Asked if the worst was over, Hollande said, \"Yes, the worst \u2013 in the sense of the fear of the eurozone breaking up - is over. But the best isn't there yet. It's up to us to build it.\"</p> <p><em>Interview conducted by Sylvia Kauffmann (Le Monde), Angelique Chrisafis (The Guardian) Berna Gonzalez Harbour (El Pais), Jaroslaw Kurski (Gazeta Wyborcza), Alberto Mattioli (La Stampa) et Stefan Ulrich (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung)</em></p> <p><em>In keeping with established practice in France, Hollande's quotes were approved prior to publication.</em></p>",
  "<h2>Bouldin Creek Coffeehouse</h2> <p>Austin gained a reputation as a mecca for hippies during the \"cosmic cowboy\" days of the 1970s, and no neighbourhood keeps it weird like South Austin.

  "<h2>Favourite phenomenon</h2> <p>Texans outside Austin consider Austinites quite batty. A centre of counter culture (read: hippies) in the state, Austin is also home to all the crazy politicians the citizenry of the state has sent to the State Capitol to represent them. Maybe it's the rest of Texas that's bats. The real centre of batty activity in Austin is the <strong>Congress Avenue Bridge</strong>, 10 blocks south of the Capitol, and home to about a million actual bats. Every evening a giant cloud of these boogers swoops out from under the bridge to feed on insects, and every evening hundreds of people come out to watch them. If only the bats would develop a taste for politicians.</p> <h2>Favourite Mexican restaurant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397960425\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/site_furniture/2012/10/8/1349694704156/El-Patio-Mexican-Restaura-009.jpg\" alt=\"El Patio Mexican Restaurant, Austin, Texas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: mistermed/flickr</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mistermed/flickr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the city's oldest and best is <strong>El Patio</strong>, just north of the University Of Texas campus, where Elvis Presley once scarfed the enchiladas, and pictures of football legends grace the oh-so-20th-century wood-panelled walls.

  "<p>What future is there for NHS hospitals unable to make ends meet? Many people assume <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/25/nhs-trust-special-measures-debt\" title=\"\">the supposedly \"bankrupt\" South London Healthcare Trust</a>, which runs major hospitals in Bromley, Woolwich and Sidcup, will be handed to the private sector. Some assume it'll be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/private-sector-failing-hospitals\" title=\"\">the first of many</a>.</p> <p>But the private sector is wary. Why take on struggling NHS hospitals? Such takeovers may please a government intent on hacking back the public sector workforce, and a health secretary encumbered with dozens of NHS hospitals too indebted for foundation trust status, but firms see a health sector starved of growth and a tariff system that's become a tool for squeezing costs. They worry about their reputations. And they watch what's happening with Circle, which took over the threatened <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/03/hinchingbrooke-nhs-trust-goes-private\" title=\"\">Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire</a> back in February.</p> <p>To fulfil its side of the deal, Circle, led by the charismatic chief executive Ali Parsa, needs surpluses of \u00a370m over a decade. It would keep 44%. But Hinchingbrooke hasn't made a \u00a31m surplus this century, so aggressive cost-cutting seems inevitable. Now <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hinchingbrooke-hospital-first-privately-run-nhs-1363151\" title=\"\">staff morale and patient satisfaction are falling</a>. By August, according to NHS Midlands and East's measure (\"Would you recommend this hospital to your friends and family?\"), Hinchingbrooke had <a href=\"http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/acute-trusts/hinchingbrooke-health-care-nhs-trust/hinchingbrooke-health-care-trust-slips-down-patient-satisfaction-table/5048871.article\" title=\"\">dropped from sparkling to average</a>.</p> <p>Thriving foundation trusts with international reputations, now under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/02/mandarins-nhs-battle-future-health\" title=\"\">Monitor</a> umbrella, may be tempted into \"partnerships\". Some offer rich rewards. But most NHS hospitals would need financial bait: subsidies, income guarantees or a material undervaluing of the assets.</p> <p>For the present, however, the less glamorous non-acute sector of the NHS \u2013 worth an estimated \u00a315-20bn \u2013 is proving attractive. The principal predators aren't private health providers but global outsourcing companies. Their business model is simple enough: win the tender, take on the staff, shred the management structure and cut costs.</p> <p>It's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/03/private-contracts-signed-nhs-privatisation\" title=\"\">privatisation fuelled by the \"any qualified provider\" regime</a> which, since April, forces NHS commissioners to offer whole services to competition. If there's one field where the outsourcing companies have special expertise, it's competitive tendering. But the process began in earnest two years ago, when primary care trusts were forced to offload the \"provider arms\" that employed community nurses, therapists and others.</p> <p>This year Virgin has already won the contract to run community services in north-west and south-west Surrey (worth somewhere between \u00a3450m and \u00a3650m), and is currently preferred bidder for a \u00a3140m contract for children's services in Devon. Serco, meanwhile, captured a \u00a3140m contract to run community services in Suffolk.</p> <p>What makes community health services such a lucrative proposition? Unlike acute hospitals, there's no effective tariff system: measuring what a district nurse or a physiotherapist actually achieves is more complex than counting hospital \"spells\". Pruning a community team is less visible than closing a hospital. The risks are lower, the profit margins higher.</p> <p>Despite occasional bad press \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/31/serco-gp-service-cornwall\" title=\"\">Serco's out-of-hours GP service in Cornwall </a>has caused a little local difficulty \u2013 the trend is set to continue. Virgin's success in Surrey followed overt pressure from the MP for south-west Surrey on commissioners to expedite the deal. That's Jeremy Hunt, now secretary of state for health.</p> <p>Government's happy. To smooth Virgin's path into Surrey, it found a device to safeguard the prized NHS pension rights of 2,500 staff. Rather than working directly for Virgin Health, they have transferred instead to the employment of <a href=\"http://m.lgcplus.com/5043774.article\" title=\"\">VH Doctors</a> \u2026 a social enterprise.</p> <p>Ah, social enterprise. Many NHS community teams opted in 2011 to form new social enterprises, following the example of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/18/camerons-big-society-rich-surrey\" title=\"\">Central Surrey Health</a>. Lauded by Gordon Brown and David Cameron alike, it's served 280,000 people in Surrey for five years. But its core mid-Surrey contract is up for renewal. In May, the Department of Health was already warning that, unless they improve their \"commercial skills\", social enterprises will lose their core NHS contracts as they mature. The whole \"movement\" could prove no more than a transitional phase. That's unnerving for ministers keen to lure large numbers of local government staff out of state employment.</p> <p>Now GP practices may be the next target. The \u00a315bn NHS primary care budget is juicy enough, but, cajoled and flattered into taking on the entire \u00a365bn NHS commissioning budget, practices now hold the key to even greater riches. Only 2.2% are currently owned by corporates. That may be about to change.</p> <p>GPs thought they'd be in charge, but international health insurers and consultancies wait in the wings to help steer commissioning when, inevitably, it flounders.</p> <p>Did GPs seriously believe they'd be handed control of that much public money?</p>",
  "<p>The computer hacker whose extradition to the US was blocked by the home secretary says he feels liberated by the decision after more than a decade of \"living with a dark and hollow feeling\".</p> <p>Gary McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome and suffers from depression, is accused by US authorities of carrying out the \"biggest military computer hack of all time\", but was spared from extradition on human rights grounds in a dramatic statement to the Commons on Tuesday by Theresa May.</p> <p>May said the decision, which sparked criticism from the US government but joy among McKinnon's supporters and extradition law campaigners, was based on medical evidence suggesting there was a \"high risk\" of him killing himself if sent to stand trial in the US. The 46-year-old admits having accessed US government computers but says he was doing so in order to look for evidence of UFOs.</p> <p>Speaking in the aftermath of the decision, about which his mother informed him late on Tuesday morning shortly before May's statement, Glasgow-born McKinnon said he felt hopeful for the first time in a decade. \"I have spent the past 10 years living with a dark and hollow feeling,\" he told the Daily Mail. \"I have always thought that if things went against me, I would just have to end it all and take my own life. Now I just feel that I have been set free.\"</p> <p>Referring to his long-term girlfriend, Lucy Clarke, who campaigned against his extradition alongside Janis Sharp, McKinnon's mother, he added: \"I had no hopes for a future, no way of making plans, no thoughts of asking Lucy to share my life, no thoughts of whether I could ever have children or get work. It still does not feel real \u2013 but only now am I starting to feel as if a shutter has flipped up and lifted in my head.\"</p> <p>After she explained why she had taken the unusual step of blocking the extradition, May said it would be up to the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer, to decide whether or not McKinnon should face charges in the UK. He would have faced up to 60 years in prison if convicted of charges in the US. His lawyer, Karen Todner, has said she hoped the DPP might take the view that Gary had already \"suffered enough\".</p> <p>On Tuesday night, the US justice department issued a statement criticising the home secretary's move. \"The United States is disappointed by the UK home secretary's decision not to extradite Gary McKinnon, particularly given the past decisions of the UK courts and prior home secretaries that he should face trial in the United States. We note that the home secretary has described this case as exceptional and, thus, this decision does not set a precedent for future cases. The home secretary has acknowledged that Mr McKinnon is accused of serious crimes and that the United Kingdom's director of public prosecutions will now consider whether Mr McKinnon has a case to answer in a UK court.\"</p> <p>It added: \"Our extradition relationship with the United Kingdom remains strong, as is demonstrated by the extradition of five alleged terrorists from the United Kingdom just last week.\"</p>",

And now the development team has returned with another NFS offshoot and another scintillating interpretation.</p> <p>Set in and around the sprawling metropolis of Fairhaven, Most Wanted challenges players to become the most notorious illegal racer in town, speeding through a series of illicit driving events, gathering speed points and unlocking mods. Brilliantly, very few of the dozens of licensed vehicles are locked at the start of the game; instead, they're hidden around the enormous map \u2013 if you find them, you can keep them. And you're free to explore the entire open-world environment at your leisure, locating challenges and races en route.</p> <p>So how does a studio go about creating a landscape designed specifically for high speed thrills? \"It's quite an interesting process,\" says creative director, Craig Sullivan. \"We start out talking about the kind of variety we want. So in Hot Pursuit, which was quite different to Most Wanted, we knew we wanted mountains so you could drive in the snow, and we wanted desert so you'd get that Vanishing Point feel. We purposefully didn't have a city because that game was all about going 200mph through rolling beautiful curves. We were also inspired by California, so we wanted beautiful coastlines, forests \u2013 almost a homage back to the original Hot Pursuit games. But with Most Wanted, we knew it had to be based around a city. We kept the coastline, though - it's our job to make something you can memorise, so if you know the coastline is on the south, you can orientate yourself around that\".</p> <p>The next step was to add specific gameplay set-pieces \u2013 an abandoned airfield, a power plant with lots of off road runs \u2013 destination areas for players to discover and experiment with. Then comes the road network, or ribbons as Criterion call it, which links everything together and accommodates the vehicle handling. The underlying ambition is to create a world that looks authentic, but that offers up a range of ridiculous possibilities. \"We've got a 500ft jump that goes across a freeway,\" says Sullivan. \"You don't get many of those in real life, but it's all about staging things so they look like they could exist. I spent a long time skateboarding when I was a kid and I understand the flow of skate parks, the lines you naturally seek out; you take a similar approach when you're driving at speed: with the best open-world games you'll find yourself, not in a funnel, but in a geometry set that feeds itself to you as you travel, which allows you to have a fun time - it's something you can get very wrong, but we'd already done Burnout Paradise so we had experience with exploration\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398091921\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350417530293/mostwanted2.jpg\" alt=\"Need For Speed: Most Wanted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Predictably, the designers are heavily inspired by real cities. During the development of Most Wanted, Criterion sent a group of its design staff to Boston, a historic city with a variety of road surfaces and architectural spaces. \"To build an authentic city, it can't all look pristine and new,\" says Sullivan. \"It needs to look as though it has been constructed over many years. We wanted cobbles, we wanted wide plaza areas and narrow alleys. I'm just about to go on vacation to LA and Hawaii and I know there are things I'll see that will make me think 'that would be cool in a game'. If you find something that looks natural, that looks like it would be fun to drive a car off or through or over, it helps with the design process. We're constantly trying to keep that balance between believability and fun\".</p> <p>Another key element of the Criterion driving experience is handling. The studio is famous for its accessible, exciting driving model, combining real-life physics with elements of classic japanese arcade design, so you get cars that feel authentic, but can still drift over a kilometre of tarmac. \"There are so many little parts that go into making a great driving experience,\" says Sullivan. \"We start out with the raw data from the manufacturers and produce an accurate simulation of what that car is like to drive; Most Wanted contains the most realistic simulation we've ever done - and we could have stayed with that. There are plenty of games out there that are all about simulating how hard it is to drive a car, but we want to go beyond that - it needs to meet your expectations of what a car is like to drive.\" </p> <p>So what does that mean for the coders? \"There's lots of Criterion DNA in there,\" says Sullivan. \"The brakes are a little bit stronger than they are in a real car so you can weave through traffic at speed. We have systems that help you control the drift \u2013 you can get the back end out doing 150-200mph \u2013 I don't know many drivers in the world who could do a 2km drift like that. In our game we have\u2026 they're not really assists, they're smart little systems that allow you to feel like you're really driving that Porsche 911. It feels believable, but it allows you to drive in a cool way\".</p> <p>These systems are the result of Criterion's obsessive approach to development, and it has been this way since the beginning. \"We spent a lot of time back in 2000, talking about the roots of driving games, talking about AM2,\" says Criterion's vice president, Alex Ward. \"That's where we started: we just discussed braking and sliding \u2013 if you don't have those right, you have nothing.\"</p> <p>Both Alex and Craig talk about the endless iteration that goes on at the studio, the compulsion to play and improve. \"We constantly change things,\" shrugs Sullivan. \"Not for the sake of change, but to improve it. Is the game too long, too short, is there enough variety? We're lucky with EA \u2013 they know we change a lot of stuff, but they're not nervous. We iterate the crap out of every game we do, we're always cutting stuff, adding stuff, right to the end. When it gets to the later stages, when the debugging begins, the team just wants people like me out of the office because I'm always tweaking stuff. There's an email I always send out, the subject header is 'just one last change' but no one ever believes that it is. They say 'can we send him on holiday?'\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398091922\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350417621884/mostwanted3.jpg\" alt=\"Need For Speed: Most Wanted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Over the years, though all of this, Criterion has learned one vital lesson: handling is all about flattering the player \u2013 even if they haven't a clue about racing lines, the apex of a curve or brake management, you mustn't tell them that. \"There's a reason you can't turn assists on and off in a Criterion game,\" says Sullivan. \"We're trying to make one experience that allows as many people as possible to have fun. There are a lot of different cars in the game and some of them are hard to drive - we have an Ariel Atom in there and I don't think theres's been one on a Need For Speed game before. It drives like a wasp; it's very quick it corners insanely but it's also very weak, if it touches anything you crash\".</p> <p>I try to interject with another question, but he's off now, breathlessly listing super cars. \"We have Bugatti Veyron in there, the Lamborghini Aventador, we've got the Koenigsegg Agera R in there, which is currently the fastest production car in the world. They all drive in a very different way, but they still have that\u2026 we're influenced by games we've played in arcades: our job as game creators is to make sure that within two minutes of picking up the controller you can drive the car how you want to drive it and nothing seems unfair. You <em>are</em> going to crash at some point but that should make you smile because you know YOU'VE messed up. That's the secret of tight, sweet-spot handling. That's what we always strive to capture\". </p> <p>Criterion has learned something else from the arcades: the importance of inter-player rivalry. Introduced in Hot Pursuit, the Autolog system would show players the times achieved by their friends on every race they attempted. This meant that, even in the single-player mode there was a constant sense of competition, you'd re-try events dozens of times to beat your friends and get to the top of the leaderboard. In Most Wanted that concept is being extended so that almost everything you do in the game can be compared against the activities of your mates. Approach a speed camera, for example, and a little table will pop up showing how fast your friends have shot through it before you. Pull off an amazing jump through one of the game's many billboards, and when your pals approach that same board in their own game, they'll find a poster of your face (taken with the Kinect or Playstation Eye camera if you have one), together with your jump distance.</p> <p>It has proven to be a remarkably popular feature already, and Criterion knows why. \"We always wanted Autolog to change the way people play racing games,\" says Sullivan. \"It was based on stuff we were doing in the office: we'd play Forza or Gran Turismo and we were writing our best times down on a white board, like in Top Gear. And we were like, 'why doesn't the game do this?' So we came up with Autolog and it immediately drove competition around the studio. We had an instance during development where some of the guys in our IT department were playing an event called Vanishing Point; the guy who designed the handling for the cars, Matt Follett, had set an amazing time that nobody could beat - the IT guys attempted it 750 times, they just tried to do it over and over again. Once they'd finally beaten it, they told Matt, who went back in and beat their record first time. He crushed them. They were devastated.\" </p> <p>The Criterion team seems to thrive on these tales of obsession. Alex Ward starts telling me about Burnout Paradise, the team's first open-world title. Some of the brand's fans weren't sure about the game, weren't sure about the move to a gigantic environment. \"We used to get people writing to us saying, you've blown it, I'm not playing this game anymore,\" he says. \"So Matt Webster would ping their telemetry and find out that they'd been playing for 870 hours. We'd write back and say, we're sorry we couldn't entertain you more.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the most important design decision in Most Wanted is the lack of a vehicle progression system. In most racers, you start off with dull everyday vehicles and have to go through a series of races before you start unlocking the really cool sports cars and exotics. But in Criterion's latest - the only cars kept from you are the one's you gain by beating the Most Wanted racers. Everything else is out on the map to discover. </p> <p>How did this come about? \"We have big ideas, but they come at different stages,\" says Sullivan. \"Most Wanted didn't start out as the game you're playing today. We course correct, we change things. We had talked about all the cars being unlocked right at the start of the project, and we spent a bit of time looking at it, but it was a hard problem to solve. So we actually started with a linear progression system. But later, when we had the basics of a game - the races, the cop chases, the open world \u2013 built, we realised we could go back and look at this idea of all the cars being open.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398091923\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350417710518/mostwanted4.jpg\" alt=\"Need For Speed: Most Wanted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For Sullivan, there was a nagging discrepancy at the heart of linear progression: how could you offer an open world, but then restrict access to vehicles? It didn't make sense. \"For the kind of games we're making, especially with Need For Speed, player choice is really important - if you go to Disneyland, they don't force you to go on the rides in a particular order. It might sound weird, but that's how we approach making our games - we don't know what every gamer likes, so we give you lots of things and it's up to you to decide. </p> <p>\"We made closed track games in the past - three or four Burnout games - there's space for that kind of title in the market, but we're focused on pushing the genre forward and we think open worlds and player choice is where it's at. Driving around a track, be it real or fictional, there's only so much we can bring to that: you can improve the visuals - where else is there to go? We want game designs that support new experiences, things that we might not even know we're going to design - we don't want to hem everything in\".</p> <p>Alex Ward is even more bullish in his dismissal of standard racing game progression structures. \"Do you want to drive the Aston Martin right now? The Carrera? Why not? 20 years of driving convention says you can't, but why not? People said the game would have no meaning, but no - put the cars in the world and go drive them. Find the Caterham and take it out. And once you've found it you can switch to it at any time. </p> <p>\"I don't want to make you backtrack around the map. Gaming is changing, this is where we 're going. That's why there's no story in the game - I don't want a story, the game is about me! It's about me and my friends. The stuff we're working on with most Wanted and beyond\u2026 it's like, that's tradition, but fuck it, let's do <em>this</em>. Why can't I drive all the cars? If I buy a DVD I can watch the ending straight away if I like. If DVDs were like games they'd make you watch the Dutch version to get an achievement. But that's the past. Grinding is dead\".</p> <p>So, about the future. What will the new consoles bring? I didn't expect Sullivan to engage with the question, developers can be wary about moving away from the safe ground of their current project. He thinks for a second. \"Even bad games have good graphics these days - it's quite easy to do good graphics,\" he says. \"There are other things to do with the next generation of hardware that developers need to embrace to make a true next gen experience\".</p> <p>What things? \"Look at the last five or six Criterion games: we strongly believe friends are the heart of it all, we know that Autolog is here to stay - all games should be connected. The cross-platform stuff is interesting, lots of platforms talking to each other, gaming everywhere, making the best out of Kinect and cameras. It's about embracing all that. You can't rely on the fact that the graphics will be better. It should be about next generation game design, not just a prettier experience. The same thing happens in movies \u2013 to me The Matrix didn't just look amazing, it was almost like a new experience. Generational change means finding new things to grab your attention\".</p> <p>So we end up talking about where Criterion is going, about this studio's role in the future Sullivan envisages. \"There's still a lot of stuff we want to do with driving,\" he says. \" We <em>will</em> make another Burnout game at some point. Obviously, as we're working on NFS we're thinking of really good ideas that aren't right for this series; there are ideas that we're going to explore with Burnout. And we wouldn't be making NFS or Burnout games if we didn't think the driving genre had a long shelf life and that we could push the boundaries. There's a lot of new stuff in Most Wanted, a lot for people to get their heads around - and sometimes there's only so much explaining you can do - we've reined in some of the ideas we had for this game, they were a little ahead of their time\".</p> <p>Okay, I say, let's imagine you're going to tackle another classic game series, you can take anything you like \u2013 what would it be? \"When we did Burnout Paradise we did some motorbike DLC and now everyone thinks that we're going to do Road Rash at some point,\" says Sullivan. \"I had a lot of fun playing that game, we think bikes are fun. We might make a Road Rash game\u2026. But then we might make a game without vehicles in it. I mean, we made Black, I was the lead designer \u2013 we might make a game about blowing the crap out of each other!\"</p> <p>He pauses and smiles, before pointedly adding, \"but Road Rash seems like a good fit for Criterion\u2026\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Need For Speed: Most Wanted is released for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 2 November</em></p>",

An event that brings together a sprinkling of heads of state \u2013 President Joyce Banda of Malawi is here, ministers, development experts and NGOs, the theme this year is sustainable and inclusive growth for human development.</p> <p>Canfin, who was on a panel on social protection, outlined France's approach to development to the Guardian at the start of the conference on Tuesday. The former MEP, who set up an NGO called <a href=\"http://www.finance-watch.org/\" title=\"\">Finance Watch</a> which pushed for greater transparency in financial flows, said France, where aid makes up only 0.46% of GNI, planned to meet the 0.7% target by putting in 10% of revenues from a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-31/french-lawmakers-pass-budget-bill-including-transaction-tax.html\" title=\"\">financial transactions tax</a>, expected to raise \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn). Legislation pending in November will fix the 10% figure into law.</p> <p>But Canfin's interests and priorities lie elsewhere. He and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande are making a big push for the EU's directives on transparency and accounting, currently making their way through the system. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/19/eu-tougher-transparency-law-extractive\" title=\"\">directives, which were approved by a key parliamentary committee last month,</a> require companies to publish their payments to foreign governments. The move received strong backing from Hollande when he was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Senegal last week.</p> <p>The French leader said he favoured \"real\" transparency, with extractive industries reporting not just country by country but also project by project, without exception. NGOs have been pressing hard on this last point in the belief that high transparency in the accounts of powerful western companies will help lift the \"resource curse\" \u2013 whereby wealth in countries with abundant natural resources remains with a small elite.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/05/africa-mineral-wealth-poverty-world-bank\" title=\"\">World Bank report</a> said that although African countries with natural resources have enjoyed high economic growth \u2013 such as Angola \u2013 there has been little poverty reduction.</p> <p>\"We are very committed with the Nordic countries to these directives; they are our red line,\" said Canfin. \"We want them to be as strong as US standards. That way it will set a 'pre-global standard' and we can go to Japan and China and say 'this is what we're doing'.\"</p> <p>Canfin applauded support for strong transparency rules from Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, last week, saying the UK position is key. \"In the past month, there seemed to be an erosion of support in the UK, so it was important for Clegg to reaffirm British support.\"</p> <p>Canfin is counting \u2013 perhaps overoptimistically \u2013 on the directives leading to more wealth staying in developing countries as they negotiate better deals with western companies. \"This could have a tremendous impact on development, and the budgetary costs to developed countries would be close to zero,\" he said, an acknowledgment of the pressure to cut aid budgets in the west.</p> <p>Elaborating on the theme that aid is just a component of development, Canfin said France would hold a public debate on development policy next month. \"It's a debate we have not had for more than 15 years and it will cover more than aid,\" he said. He praised Britain's efforts to push for greater transparency and public accountability of its aid, adding: \"Aid is one topic of consideration, but we also need to consider other areas \u2013 finance, agriculture and trade.\"</p> <p>On agriculture, particularly the common agricultural policy (CAP), which has been criticised for damaging the interests of poor countries despite reforms that have curbed the worst excesses, Canfin said France \u2013 where farmers have resisted CAP changes \u2013 would push for a \"greener, more sustainable\" EU policy. On trade, he said France was willing to delay a 2014 deadline for completing economic partnership agreements (EPAs). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/12/trade-talks-europe-africa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">EPAs are disliked by poor countries for forcing them to open their markets to competition that they cannot withstand</a>. Canfin said France was willing to change the deadline to 2016, to allow more time to take into account the reservations of developing countries.</p> <p>France's broad approach to development finds favour among some NGOs. \"There are two main approaches emerging to look at the developing framework. One is the traditional aid-centred agenda, and the other is to build a more comprehensive framework looking at the issue of coherent policies, innovative financing, democratisation and human rights,\" said Olivier Consolo of <a href=\"http://www.concordeurope.org/\" title=\"\">Concord</a>, a group of European NGOs. \"Both governments and NGOs need to focus more on this comprehensive framework, looking ahead to the post-2015 agenda, which will also bring into discussion an international sustainable development framework.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the downpour of Warsaw and the disgrace of Krusevac, English football awakes in a less than sprightly mood this morning. There is a sense of frustration and anger on these shores, with spirits in Scotland and Wales hardly great either after their teams' respective defeats to Belgium and Croatia. At least the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland achieved results to bring a smile to the faces of their people, and should any of them support <strong>Manchester City</strong> then they have even more reason to be grinning today.</p> <p>Because it appears Roberto Mancini's team are preparing to spend more money on more central midfielders, with today's newspapers reporting that <strong>City want to sign Daniele De Rossi and Sergio Busquets</strong>.</p> <p>The Premier League champions have long been linked with De Rossi and, having come close to signing him during the last transfer window, are apparently ready to <strong>offer Roma \u00a330m for the 29-year-old Italy international in January</strong>.</p> <p>And if you thought that was a lot of money then check out how much <strong>City are prepared to spend on Busquets \u2013 \u00a360m</strong>. That's right, \u00a360m, for Sergio Busquets. I'm struggling to believe it, too, but City want the 24-year-old Barcelona player and are prepared to go all out to get him, with Busquets apparently having a \u00a3121m release clause in his contract with the Spanish club.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>Liverpool are once again linked with Daniel Sturridge</strong> after the forward was told he does not have a future at Chelsea and can leave Stamford Bridge for \u00a315m. A move to Anfield was on the cards last summer only for the deal to fall through, but Brendan Rodgers has maintained an interest in the player and given his chronic lack of strikers, <strong>the Liverpool manager looks set to make another approach for Sturridge in January</strong>. Apparently he wants the 23 year old on loan first and, if all goes well, will sign him on a long-term deal next summer.</p> <p>And finally, <strong>Andre Santos could be on his way to Galatasaray </strong>having failed to establish himself at Arsenal. The 29-year-old Brazilian joined Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's men from another Turkish club, Fenerbahce, in August 2011 but, after a decent start, has struggled to hold down a regular first-team place due to a combination of injury, loss of form and the quickening development of fellow left-back Kieran Gibbs. <strong>The Brazilian could leave London for Istanbul in January</strong>.</p> <p>That's it then. Back to Warsaw we go and the hope that there will be less farce and more football in the Polish capital this afternoon.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\"Roma's </strong><a href=\"http://www.ilmessaggero.it/cultura/libri/tutti_guida_roma_libro/notizie/223530.shtml\" title=\"\"><strong>Francesco Totti is about to launch his own guide to the city of Rome</strong></a><strong>,\" </strong>wrote Warren Hull <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/10/which-footballers-are-keen-cyclists\" title=\"\">last week</a>. <strong>\"That must be a first?\"</strong></p> <p>Players writing books about something other than football? We're not surprised you think that could be a first, Warren, but there are a few other examples.</p> <p>Ever wanted to cook Steven Gerrard's Crunchy Sea Bream with herbs? Or Carles Puyol's Pasta with Pesto? Then you need <a href=\"http://muuvit.com/eatforgoals/\" title=\"\">Eat for Goals</a>, a cookbook produced by Uefa aimed at inspiring children to eat healthily. \"While the sauce is cooking, bring lots of water to a vigorous boil in a large pot,\" writes Yoann Gourcuff in his recipe for spaghetti al'arrabiata. Thierry Henry also contributes his secret tips for rice cubana, and there are recipes from Frank Lampard, Barry Ferguson, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Kelly Smith too.</p> <p>Also in the cookery section is Cooking With The Spirit, \"a collection of favourite recipes with a unique international flavour, from the players and valued supporters of the Pittsburgh Spirit Soccer Team\". The former Aston Villa youngster and USA international Paul Child <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/COOKING-SPIRIT-Collection-recipes-Pittsburgh-Spirit/dp/B000VPPVJO/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350298806&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=Soccer\" title=\"\">features on the cover of this intriguing collection</a>.</p> <p>Albert Camus is another contender but, contrary to a few fanciful shaggy dog stories, he did not play for either France or Algeria, or even professionally. His goalkeeping career was ended by TB while he was playing for the youth team of Racing Universitaire Algerios at the age of 18. It's a bit of a stretch, then, to put The Stranger or The Plague in the same category as Totti's travel guide. The same applies to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes and goalkeeper for amateur side Portsmouth Association Football Club in the 1890s.</p> <p>David Icke, on the other hand, made 37 professional appearances for Hereford United before penning such must-read volumes as Tales from the Time Loop and The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy.</p> <p>The former Colombus Crew and Houston Dynamo forward Jason Garey also turned his hand to fiction. Garey began writing in autumn last year after suffering a hip injury. \"I was on crutches for three or four weeks and just started writing, putting down my thoughts and beliefs, and it began to take form,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/soccer-insider/post/jason-garey-striker-and-author-soccer-player-writes-novel-based-on-libertarian-beliefs/2012/07/03/gJQATUKILW_blog.html\" title=\"\">he told the Washington Post</a>. \"I just thought, 'What the heck? I'll turn this into a book.'\"</p> <p>The result is Geauxing Galt. What is it about? A look at the back cover suggests it's probably not for us:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The year is 2020 and Wyatt Bourgeouis, a self-made, principled oil driller runs head on into the massive government leviathan. Does the current path of the United States lead to a progressive utopia, or economic collapse on a massive scale? From the backwoods bayous and French Quarter streets of South Louisiana, Wyatt Bourgeouis battles Harry Maddow, the latest member of a long line of corrupt Louisiana politicians, who seek power and control over the individual.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It could be argued that Steve Bruce's three novels are, like Jaws, about more than meets the eye. Jaws in book form, so the theory goes, is about infidelity rather than a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people. Similarly it can be argued that Defender!, Striker! and Sweeper!, written when Bruce was manager of Huddersfield Town, are about murder, the bloodlust of the human condition and the scattered thoughts of a man staring into the abyss rather than football. Unfortunately, in the same way that Jaws really is about a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people, so Bruce's three books really are about football, and particularly about \"Leddersford Town\" manager \"Steve Barnes\". They're not particularly successful \u2013 Bruce himself described them as \"the biggest load of crap ever written\".</p> <p>Along with Bruce in the bin marked Novels Too Much About Football To Count Here go Terry Venables' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/They-Used-Grass-Gordon-Williams/dp/0140244220\" title=\"\">They Used To Play on Grass</a>, Jimmy Greaves' The Ball Game (a fictional account following the adventures of cockney striker \"Jackie Groves\" worth checking out for the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ball-Game-Jimmy-Greaves/dp/0213167441/ref=sr_1_16?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350306445&amp;sr=1-16\" title=\"\">rather startling cover</a>), and Theo Walcott's in-no-way-autobiographical <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/T-J-Hat-trick-Theo-Walcott/dp/0552562459/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350306551&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\">TJ and the Hat-trick</a>.</p> <h2>WHICH FOOTBALLERS ARE KEEN CYCLISTS? (2)</h2> <p><strong>Last week we looked at the players and managers just as happy with their feet on the pedals as they are, or were, with their foot on the ball. This week reader Stig Nygard has pointed us towards two players who went further than just the odd commute. </strong></p> <p>The former Middlesbrough, Juventus, Marseille and Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli had been a fan of cycling as a child, but his interest really took off following Marco Pantani's victory double in the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in 1998. Ravenelli had met Il Pirate while playing for Juventus \u2013 \"He was prematurely bald, I was prematurely grey, so we got on famously\" \u2013 and his wins in the grand tours were an inspiration.</p> <p>But it was not until his retirement in 2005 that he was able to devote time to his new passion. And in 2008 he and his brother Andrea set up their own racing team, <a href=\"http://www.garminrevolution.it/partners/fabrizio-ravanelli-umbria-cycling-team\" title=\"\">Umbria Cycling Team</a>. \"As you'd expect, I get recognised a fair bit by the other riders,\" <a href=\"http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/mysecretvice/225/article.aspx\" title=\"\">he told FourFourTwo in 2008</a>. \"Everyone's really friendly, though. I'll be chugging along and all of a sudden I'll hear 'Ravanelli, was football not hard enough for you? Why are you putting yourself through all this pain?' They're right, too: I suffer a lot more on a bike than I ever did on the football pitch.\"</p> <p>He claimed at least one amateur victory and has taken on some of the biggest climbs in Europe. \"Last year I went with Caruso to the Swiss border to climb two of the most famous and hardest mountain passes in Italy \u2013 the Passo dello Stelvio and the Mortirolo,\" he said. \"The Stelvio is nearly 3,000m above sea level, and, at the top, we were riding between two vast walls of snow. The jubilation I felt at getting to the summit wasn't dissimilar to winning the Champions League. It's the same rush.\"</p> <p>But one player who would leave Ravanelli trailing in his wake in the mountains, if not on the pitch, is Norway's Knut Anders Fostervold. Fostervold enjoyed an eight-year career with Molde between 1994 and 2002, during which time the club were regular qualifiers for European football. Although his most famous moment will probably remain <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEt8apZZuj0\" title=\"\">this dive against Stabaek</a> (later mimicked by John Carew), in 1999-2000 he captained Molde during their most successful ever run in Europe when they reached the Champions League group stage. The club may have exited the competition after winning only one game and finishing bottom of the group, but Fostervold wore the armband at the Bernab\u00e9u against the eventual champions Real Madrid and that's a claim to fame not many can match.</p> <p>A brief loan spell at Grimsby Town followed in 2000-01 (it's not very fondly remembered at Blundell Park \u2013 \"Capable of playing centre-back, left-back or left wing-back apparently \u2026 sluggish with or without the ball and clumsy in possession\" is the recollection of <a href=\"http://thefishy.co.uk/story.php?id=8315781\" title=\"\">Grimsby fansite, The Fishy</a>) and his career came to an end due to a knee injury in 2002 at the age of 35.</p> <p>For a couple of years Fostervold cycled purely for fun, but in 2004 he began taking the sport seriously. In 2005 he came third in the Norwegian time-trial championship behind current Team Sky coach Kurt Asle Arvesen and future world champion Thor Hushovd. In 2006 he came third again, with Arvesen winning, and in 2007 he beat Arvesen for the first time only to finish second behind Edvald Boasson Hagen, who would go on to win five in a row. Despite the lack of wins in time trials he did at different times hold the Norwegian 10km, 20km and 30km time trial records.</p> <p>He even got the chance to fight for the world title. With Hushovd and Arvesen choosing not to compete in the time trial at the 2006 or 2007 world championships, Fostervold competed as Norway's representative. In 2006 he came 43rd out of 52 and in 2007 51st out of 69, each time finishing around five minutes behind the winner Fabien Cancellara.</p> <p>His VO2 max was, at his peak, registered at 94, the second-highest ever recorded by a Norwegian. But it was his bike-handing ability that held him back from the very top. \"I need to learn how to cycle, I'm a junior,\" he said after the 2006 world championships. He never quite got there, however, and ended his second sporting career in 2009 \u2026 only to begin a <a href=\"http://www.3atlet.no/kan-fostervold-vinne-norseman.4869943-170050.html\" title=\"\">third sporting career in triathlon</a>, finishing <a href=\"https://www.box.com/shared/xqhodrlfys4vczgc9f0b\" title=\"\">sixth in the 2011 Norseman Extreme Triathlon</a>.</p> <h2>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TEAMS RELEGATED</h2> <p><strong>\"Last season Villarreal competed in the Champions League and got relegated,\" </strong>writes Chris Meli. <strong>\"Has this ever happened before?\"</strong></p> <p>Plenty of times, Chris. A particularly interesting case was the collapse of Romanian minnows Unirea Urziceni, as pointed out by Jake Miller. Unirea finished second in the Romanian League in 2009-10 and enjoyed a solid Champions League campaign in 2010-11 (beating Rangers 4-1 at Ibrox in the group stage) and another second-placed league finish. Defeat in their qualifier against Zenit St Petersburg was the final straw for the chairman Dumitru Bucsaru. Bucsaru, one of Romania's richest men, had bankrolled the club's rise and now he wanted his money back.</p> <p>The Observer picks up the story in 2011: \"Bucsaru launched his exit strategy: selling off the best of the squad and, after defeat to Liverpool in the Europa League, watching the remnants slide to relegation. Last week, authorities confirmed Bucsaru had walked away, leaving behind a shell of a club with a tax debt of \u20ac1.5m. Fixtures and fittings are being sold off to help cover that \u2013 including the turnstiles, listed at \u20ac85k.\"</p> <p>(You can read more about the rise and fall of Unirea Urziceni <a href=\"http://playingthepercentages.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/rise-and-fall-of-unirea-urziceni.html\" title=\"\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://scoutingromania.com/2011/10/27/unirea-urziceni-success-can-kill-you/\" title=\"\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://scoutingromania.com/2011/07/09/remember-unirea-urziceni-well-you-might-as-well-just-forget-about-it/\" title=\"\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://theovallog.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/tyrannical-bucsaru-murders-unirea-urziceni/\" title=\"\">here</a>.)</p> <p>The 2009-10 season was also a fine one for Sampdoria. Under the tutelage of Gigi Del Neri, Giampaolo Pazzini and Antonio Cassano fired the <em>Blucerchiati </em>to fourth spot in Serie A and a place in the Champions League. The Piazza De Ferrari in Genoa saw a party the like of which it had never seen before. The 2010-11 season was not so vintage. Twenty-four hours after securing fourth place, Del Neri left the club for Juventus. Werder Bremen knocked them out of the Champions League in the play-off round with a 5-4 aggregate victory. Pazzini and Cassano followed Del Neri out of the door in the winter transfer window. And a season that began in the Champions League ended in relegation.</p> <p>Chievo suffered a similar fate in 2006-07. The previous season the Flying Donkeys were one of the beneficiaries of Juventus's off-field problems and saw their fifth-place Serie A finish turned into fourth and a Champions League spot. But their European adventure ended at the hands of Levski Sofia in the qualifying round. And on the final day of the season the Flying Donkeys lost at Catania, a result which kept the home side up at Chievo's expense. \"Kiss those asses goodbye,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/28/europeanfootball.sport?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wrote our very own James Richardson</a>.</p> <p>Several sides have fallen foul of off-field issues. Most recently Rangers competed in the Champions League in 2011-12, only to find themselves dumped down to the Third Division in 2012-13. Similarly, off-field problems saw Juventus, Champions League quarter-finalists in 2005-06, relegated to the second tier for the 2006-07 season. A similar fate befell Milan after the Totonero scandal in 1979-80. And Austrian champions Tirol Innsbruck were beaten in the qualifying round by Lokomotiv Moscow in 2001-02 and despite ending the season atop the Austrian Bundesliga once more, they were relegated two divisions to the regional leagues due to their financial difficulties and began the 2002-03 campaign as WSG Wattens/FC Wacker Tirol.</p> <p>The Danish side Hvidovre began 1974-75 facing (and losing to) Poland's Ruch Chorzow in the European Cup first round and ended it bottom and relegated. It happened again in Denmark in 2000-01, when Herfolge were battered 6-0 by Rangers in the third qualifying round of the Champions League and relegated come the season's end. And N\u00fcrnberg won the German title in 1967-68, were beaten by Ajax in the first round of the European Cup in 1968-69 and ended that season an unfortunate second-bottom of the Bundesliga, <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit69.html\" title=\"\">in one of the closest divisions of all time</a>.</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"Here in the Basque country,\" </strong>wrote Tim Tregrenza back in those halcyon days of 2006, <strong>\"there are football teams that select only Basque players. Athletic Bilbao is the most famous, but there is also Eibar (in the second division) and other lower league teams. Are there any other clubs around the world who have a similar policy?\"</strong></p> <p>Indeed there are, Tim, with the most famous being Club Deportivo de Guadalajara (also known as Chivas \u2013 Spanish for \"goats\") in Mexico. The most widely supported team in the country, Chivas have fielded only Mexican-born players for a century. Their wealthy owner, the businessman and film producer Jorge Vergara, also owns two other clubs: Costa Rica's Deportivo de Saprissa (recently beaten by Liverpool at the World Club Championship) and US Major League team Club Deportivo Chivas USA. Saprissa only use Costa Rican players, but Chivas USA's original plan to recruit only Mexican players was denied by the MLS's restrictions on foreign players. However, when the expansion side first kicked off in 2005, all but four of the 28 players in their squad were Hispanic; even their Dutch coach Thomas Rongen enrolled in a Spanish language course.</p> <p>Ecuadorian side Club Deportivo El Nacional, from the city of Quito, are another team with a restricted selection policy. According to Wikipedia, \"Nacional is called so because it belongs to the Ecuadorian military and because only players with Ecuadorian nationality are allowed to play on the team. This is why the team is nicknamed Puros Criollos (\"All-Creoles\") or El Equipo Militar (\"The Military Team\").\"</p> <p>The same source also explains the selection policy of Singaporean S-League team Young Lions. \"While the bulk of the squad is made up of members of Singapore's Under-23 team, the club also take in promising young foreign players. However, they are normally only recruited into the squad if they could potentially change their nationality to Singaporean and be eligible to play international football for Singapore at some point in the future.\"</p> <p><em>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\" title=\"\"><em>the Knowledge archive</em></a></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\"What is the biggest ever crowd at a match which has had to be called off the the last minute?\" tweets Andrew Toothill.</p> <p>\"Do you know which division has the most teams beginning with the same letter?\" asks Danny Last. \"The Championship, for instance, is very 'B' heavy.\"</p> <p>\"I was wondering if an own goal as ever been intentionally conceded by a player in protest or out of anger at his own club/fans/manager?\" writes Thomas Houghton.</p> <p>\"The Wales v Scotland game got me wondering whether two opposing managers had ever both been sacked after facing each other,\" wonders Craig Foley.</p> <p>\"Has a British club side ever fielded a team represented by all the continents (excluding Arctic/Antarctica)?\" asks Ross Purnell.</p> <p><strong>Send your questions and answers to </strong><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong>knowledge@theguardian.com</strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Every local authority is grappling with the challenge of increasing demand for services at a time of severe financial constraint. To meet this challenge we will need new partnerships and new relationships with our residents to help us solve local problems.</p> <p>One way to approach this challenge is to put restorative practice at the heart of a local authority's work. Surrey's restorative story started in youth justice and our impressive results mean we have tried to spread the principle across the work of the county council.</p> <p>We know that 70% of young people who get into trouble with the police do so only once, so we don't want to send that vast majority into adulthood with the burden of a criminal record that never goes away. Together with Surrey police, we have tried a different way of responding to young people who get into trouble.</p> <p>The cornerstone of this project is youth restorative intervention (YRI). This means that, before any decision is made to caution or prosecute a young person, the file on the young person goes to a co-located team made up of our staff and police officers who contact the victim and offender, get an understanding of what has happened and help to repair the harm that has been done.</p> <p>What this restorative intervention brings is a level of understanding and problem solving largely absent from many of our formal criminal justice responses. It requires those who are affected to identify the best means to move forward. Many young people just need to say sorry, acknowledge their mistake, and both they and their victim can move on.</p> <p>Sometimes it's more complex, and the work on both sides is more intensive. Sometimes it can involve young people whose lives are so chaotic or so traumatic that they will need a number of opportunities to go through this restorative process, and we may have to stick with them for much of their adolescence.</p> <p>The restorative system we are building has led to new approaches with our districts and boroughs, including our jointly facilitated community conferences, which give local people the authority to restoratively address anti-social behaviour in their neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Critically, our approach has helped to reduce youth crime re-offending, and anti-social behaviour. Four years ago, 1,500 young people were getting a criminal record for the first time each year in Surrey. Last year, that figure was 230. This year, we are on course to halve this number again. That makes Surrey the area of the country least likely to criminalise its young people.</p> <p>By reducing the numbers in the system we've also managed to do a better job with those who do re-offend. As a result we've seen a 73% reduction in the numbers sentenced to custody and similar significant reductions in remands to custody. With the devolution of custody budgets to local authorities from central government, this increased control over demand has serious financial implications and, for Surrey, significant benefits.</p> <p>This approach has meant that, in Surrey, we no longer need to deliver our youth justice services from within a youth offending team; instead, we have a fully integrated youth support service, dealing with the needs of a variety of young people.</p> <p>We're also using the restorative approach in schools to reduce exclusions and improve behaviour, leading to better attainment.</p> <p>In order to prevent homelessness among young people we now work with families to promote reconciliation and restore young people to their homes. We have trained staff in supported accommodation in restorative approaches in order to reduce evictions.</p> <p>Our commissioning staff are benefiting from developing restorative relationships with providers, and HR is embedding it as the first response to grievance and under-performance. We are even speaking to IT colleagues about how their customers can benefit from a restorative approach.</p> <p>The application of restorative practice has the potential to revolutionise public service by helping us reduce demand for services and helping our residents to find their own answers to their problems. We will be better equipped to meet the challenges ahead of us if we continue to apply the approach and develop as a restorative organisation.</p> <p><em>Ben Byrne is head of youth support services at Surrey county council</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>The ward round \u2013 once a fixed and inviolable feature of the hospital day, absolutely central to the business of caring for patients \u2013 has suffered a gradual and barely-noticed decline.</p> <p>That isn't to say rounds no longer happen, or are not taken seriously by those directly involved. A large, busy ward might have six or seven consultant rounds a day, and a succession of \"solo\" rounds by junior doctors and specialist teams. But there is a sense that ward rounds now have to be fitted into a schedule of competing tasks in outpatient clinics and operating theatres, and that much of the business of providing care now takes place away from the ward, and the patient.</p> <p>Rejuvenating the ward round is not always an easy mission. My own organisation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.uclh.org/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</a> (UCLH) \u2013 employs hundreds of consultants, each of whom has come to see the ward round as part of their individual craft, done in their own established style.</p> <p>Not everyone is receptive to the suggestion that the practice of rounds ought to be re-examined. There are also significant operational barriers to overcome. Increasing administrative demands on nurses and the growing number of specialist teams and individuals mean convening a multidisciplinary team, and reconnecting doctors and nurses into shared rounds, has become a significant logistical challenge.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Physicians</a>/<a href=\"http://www.rcn.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Nursing</a> report, <a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/resources/ward-rounds-medicine-principles-best-practice\" title=\"\">Ward Rounds in Medicine: Pinciples for best practice</a>, makes a number of suggestions for how these challenges might be addressed, ones that many outside healthcare would assume already form standard practice: rounds should begin with a team briefing, take place early in the working day, routinely include appropriate nursing staff and ensure patients, especially those with dementia and learning difficulties, and their families are given clear plans and information on which to base their decisions.</p> <p>Our own efforts to raise the profile of the ward round have centred on the use of a safety checklist, inspired in part by the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/ss_checklist/en/\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation \"Safer Surgery\"</a> checklist. We emphasise that the round is not simply a chance to review the patient's specific condition and progress after treatment. It is also the best opportunity to review the wider safety and wellbeing of our patients \u2013 checking basic issues such as nutrition and the risk of pressure sores, infection and deep vein thrombosis \u2013 and to discuss, record and share the plan for care, treatment and discharge with a wider professional team. Principally, it is a chance to build a rapport with the patient.</p> <p>Reforming ward round practice will require some well-established habits, attitudes and behaviours to be challenged, and strong medical and nursing leadership is really the only way that can be achieved. The immediate task should be improving communication between team members and assuring the continuity of care for patients, using the ward round to set the agenda for a whole team's activities, focused on the needs of their patients.</p> <p>In our trust, the benefits that come from more focused rounds are starting to prove persuasive. Early adopting teams made progress in \"booking\" consultant ward rounds, enabling them to schedule other nursing tasks appropriately and ensure that rounds have the support of experienced nurses. They have begun to pick up instances of lapsed DVT prophylaxis, suboptimal pain control and occult infections that might otherwise have been missed. Early data suggest improvements in patient experience, as well as reductions in length of stay and improvements in the quality of patient notes and discharge planning.</p> <p>What is clear from our progress so far is that ward rounds can be re-established as a central element of daily hospital routine, to the benefit of the clinicians involved, the efficient working of the wider organisation and, most importantly, to the patient. Re-establishing the practice requires strong local leadership from managers, nurses, medics and other professionals who recognise that high-quality, safe, efficient care often stems from getting the basics right. Well organised, well-led multidisciplinary ward rounds are central to achieving that aim.</p> <p><em>Dr Yogi Amin is a consultant anaesthetist and intensivist at the </em><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/nationalhospital\" title=\"\"><em>National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery</em></a><em>, Queen Square, and is project lead for University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust's 'Ward Safety Checklist' initiative.</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Ralph sped through the darkness at top speed. He had to get away, he had to! There was no doubt about it: Walter was a liar. He had been lying to Ralph for all of these years, but still he had only just realised. <em>I mustn't be a very good agent then</em>, he thought to himself, <em>if I've been working for my entire career with an enemy\u2026</em></p> <p>Ralph pushed away some branches blocking him, and reluctantly ran into the forest. Ralph wasn't one for superstitions, but it still frightened him when people said \"Bad luck will come if you go in the forest\u2026\" </p> <p>The darkness kicked in, but it wasn't a surprise. Ralph was used to darkness. Even then\u2026 he'd been with Walter\u2026 As the fleeing teenager ran, it seemed as though the trees whispered. <em>Ralph</em>, they seemed to slur, <em>Ralph, turn back. Turn back, Ralph</em>.</p> <p>Ralph was too terrified to turn back though. He was petrified. So would you be, if you woke up and found your closest friend holding a knife above you, about to strike. Or who you'd thought was your closest friend. There had been nothing for it; Ralph had rolled sideways as Walter brought the knife down, and had narrowly missed death. He'd climbed onto the window-sill and, without looking back, disappeared into the night beyond.</p> <p>But that was before - the past. Well, only five minutes ago in the past, but anyway. And with this searing thought, a wave of tiredness swept over Ralph. No more running, no more. Sinking into a puddle in the forest, the deep dark forest. Deep dark\u2026 Deep\u2026. De-\u2026</p> <p>Ralph blinked. Trees all around him. Where was he? Then he remembered. Last night, Walter, the betrayal, everything came flooding back to him. He tried to stand up but couldn't.</p> <p>And that was when he realised that he was lying in a clearing, his feet and hands tied together with a sturdy rope, and a cloth gag around his mouth. Uncomfortable.</p> <p>Suddenly, Ralph could hear noises. A person, crunching on the twigs and the leaves with what sounded like some very heavy boots. But when the person actually emerged, Ralph could see that it was only Walter. Only Walter. Hah.</p> <p>\"Oh Ralph,\" Walter smirked, \"I see you've woken up.\" Then, mockingly, Walter held up The Pyramid and placed it on the floor right next to Ralph's head. \"It's so close,\" he laughed, \"So close, Ralph, but you can't get it. I can though, and I have.\"</p> <p>Ralph chewed the cloth viciously and his gag gave way and slid off his face. Walter showed no sign of doing anything, although there was a glint of fear in his eye. <em>It's a good thing</em>, thought Ralph, <em>he's crumbling. Only slightly, but its sure progress</em>.</p> <p>\"I have some questions,\" Ralph asked, \"and I want you to guarantee that you'll answer them, seeing as I'm probably going to die anyway.\"</p> <p>\"Alright, then. Anything.\"</p> <p>\"How did you fool us?\"</p> <p>\"Easy: faked the history, faked the training, faked the everything.\"</p> <p>\"But wouldn't Dr Fracture have spotted that? After all\u2026 he is the best in the world.\"</p> <p>\"He's not as powerful as you think.\"</p> <p>\"And you? Are you as powerful as you think?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, I am, actually.\"</p> <p>\"And how might that work out?\"</p> <p>\"Oh, I don't know. Maybe\u2026 me taking over the world?!\"</p> <p>\"And your Ma?\"</p> <p>\"Ah, she's not my Ma. Just an agent who's a good actress.\"</p> <p>\"Where's your Ma?\"</p> <p>\"She rebelled against us ages ago. Somewhere on your side, I think. She was a complete let-down\u2026\"</p> <p>\"At least she was doing the right thing.\"</p> <p>\"Nah, she wasn't.\"</p> <p>\"Just\u2026 why?\"</p> <p>\"It might hurt you, but it doesn't hurt me.\"</p> <p>With that, he was off. Picking up the pyramid and off into the woods. Leaving Ralph tied to the ground. He'd be back though. Ralph knew it.</p> <p>Suddenly, the captive had an idea. He still had his belt on, and his belt happened to be studded. He wriggled around on the floor, slicing the rope with the studs, and sat up. Then he untied his feet with his hands. <em>Sorry, Walter</em>, he thought. <em>You're not so clever</em>. And then off he went running, promising himself that he would never stop again.</p> <p>Obviously though, he had to stop. To eat, to drink, to pee, there were all sorts. But where?</p> <p>There were no plans. Ralph had no idea what Walter was doing or where he was. If he asked a shopkeeper or anyone else, they would have no hesitation on answering. People were naturally scared of Walter. Ralph had been when he had just met him. So that was it: he had to stay out of sight.</p> <p>Ralph knew which berries were edible and which weren't, he knew how to hunt and how to find water. He'd learnt in training. And so he scraped by, eating what he could find and slowly making his way to what he thought was his headquarters. What he thought\u2026</p> <p>And so as days passed by Ralph grew hungrier and weaker until the point where he thought that he should just give up and give in. Just in time though, he came across a building. A massive, grey, empowering building, just like Dr.Fracture's headquarters. So he went inside.</p> <p>Inside was dull and dreary. There was a burly man at reception who didn't even look up when a beaten and battered boy stumbled in. There was a serious lady sat on a wooden chair in the corner, and there was\u2026 there was\u2026 Walter.</p> <p>His headquarters\u2026 No, it wasn't! It looked nothing like his headquarters! So what was it, and why was Walter there? No\u2026 it was\u2026 Walter's headquarters\u2026 However, Walter hadn't seen Ralph yet and he wasn't about to. Ralph quickly pressed a button for a lift and hopped in. The doors closed and the lift went up, up, up\u2026</p> <p>Ralph had never been one for heights. So when he found the lift doors opening on the roof of the building, he wasn't very pleased. He was high up. Really high up. And there was no way back. He couldn't go down again because of the risk that Walter would be there. He couldn't jump off the side off the building because\u2026 the reasons were obvious. He couldn't go up either. Why not? Only because he didn't have wings.</p> <p>So he would just have to stay put and hope for the best. Ralph eased his way to the back of the lift and collapsed into a heap on the roof, sleep, sleep, sleep.</p> <p>\"Hi.\"</p> <p>\"What?\" Ralph opened his eyes and shaded them from the sun with his hands. There was a boy of about eight stood before him. He had curly red hair, lots of freckles, and some metal framed glasses. He was wearing what appeared to be some dungarees and a red t-shirt.</p> <p>\"Who are you?\" Ralph muttered cautiously.</p> <p>\"My name's Neville. I'm Walt's brother. I found you sleeping up here. It must have been a cold night. I sleep up here sometimes too.\"</p> <p>\"Walt\u2026 as in Walter?\"</p> <p>\"That's his cover name. He was previously on mission to fool a boy called Ralph. What's your name?\"</p> <p>\"Um\u2026 Elly.\"</p> <p>\"That's a girl's name.\"</p> <p>\"I didn't say Elly, I said Ellis.\"</p> <p>\"Oh\u2026 Nice to meet you Ellis. What'cha doing here?\"</p> <p>\"I'm a cleaner.\"</p> <p>\"Nice try. I know all the cleaners. You're Ralph aren't you. A lady saw you, and they're carrying out a big search for you inside. I was sent to check if you were up here.\"</p> <p>Panic swirled in Ralph's head. They'd seen him. He was\u2026 a failure. A complete and utter failure. And now this\u2026 eight year old\u2026 was going to find him and capture him. This eight year old was going to ruin his life.</p> <p>\"No, please! Don't-\"</p> <p>\"Doesn't matter. I won't. You're the only one I've told, but I don't really\u2026 I'm not really 'on their side'. I'm 'on your side'.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, thanks\u2026I mean, won't your brother be looking for me?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, he will. We need to get outta' here.\"</p> <p>\"How?\"</p> <p>But before Neville could answer, the door of the lift opened with a beep and nobody else than Walter was stood in it.</p> <p>\"Good work, Neville,\" he exclaimed, grinning.</p> <p>Neville grinned back.</p> <p><strong>Are you a budding writer or poet? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your scribblings!</strong></p>",
  "<p>I go straight into the subject and in answer to my first question , Bill Adams smiles and says: </p> <blockquote> <p>I'm marching to think about a new future for my kids, and their kids</p> </blockquote> <p><br>He's thought carefully about what it means to him to march on Saturday and he sums it up like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>The government's attitude to reducing the deficit is completely flawed - what they are doing is making things worse. We need to look at how we finance things in this country, our tax system, benefits and welfare. We need a new social contract between business, government and the workforce.</p> </blockquote> <p>Throughout our interview, Adams glances frequently at the picture of his three children on his office wall, one a student and the other two with jobs but not sustainable ones, not good ones. His daughter, who has a history degree, manages a restaurant, but it's not what she wants to do. Every interview she goes to elicits the same response \u2013 not enough experience. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397865603\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350402132080/Adams1.jpg\" alt=\"TUC march\" width=\"460\" height=\"294\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Adams in Leeds, getting ready for Saturday's march in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His son manages a website, making sure the sales are up, and his other son is at still at university. Like millions of parents in Britain, he worries what a decade of austerity will bring for his children. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/about_bbarber.cfm\">Brendan (Barber)</a> has led the opposition to austerity better than any politician. I really believe that Brendan has the right strategies. We're not saying that we won't rebalance the economy but it needs to be done in such a way that gets people paying tax rather than drawing benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>Outside his office there are reminder of the economic crisis. In the heart of the financial sector in Leeds, For Sale and To Let signs hang like bunting and there's a queue outside the job centre. Adams has been involved with the trade union movement since leaving school at 16 to take up an apprenticeship. After years of low paid work,getting up at 5am, 6 days a week, he returned to full-time education in 1989, earning a law degree at the University of Central Lancashire. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397865604\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350402213181/Adams2.jpg\" alt=\"TUC March\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs of recession in the heart of Leeds, England's second biggest financial centre after London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, he jokes, he gets up at six and,works five days a week although I suspect Adams works round the clock. He began as a workplace union rep, then became an education officer and is now the TUC regional secretary of Yorkshire and the Humber.</p> <p>He is deputy chair of his old university where applications dropped by 15% this year. Adams shakes his head and says that no-one believed him when he warned fee increases would deter applications from lower income or working class homes. He wants a new deal for young people: </p> <blockquote> <p>Good jobs they could aspire to or damn good training vocational schemes. <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/about_fogrady.cfm\">Francis O'Grady </a>was right, she's bang on with climate change, green energy,skills and investment for our young people. We should be saying - there's no such thing as dole lad, you turn up here and you're training to be an engineer. That to me is the long term, sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adams would rein in the worst excesses of the banks and look for ways of providing sound financial help for ordinary people \u2013 there are 25,000 people in Leeds who don't have a bank account. He sees a particular role for the north in this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New ideas need to come in. There's plenty out there. A British Investment Bank based in the north of England, for instance, would send out a message that says: 'We're not the poor neighbour.' Leeds is the second biggest financial centre in the UK. We've got the right people, the rights skills \u2013 all sorts of people who could take that on. </p> </blockquote> <p>As things stand, he reckons there's virtually an investment strike - not just in the north but across the UK. Billions of pounds that could be used to rebuild the economy are sitting in banks. Adams believes that with investment, the north could develop strong local economies. The appetite for green technology for instance, with some of the biggest polluters in terms of power stations, cement works and chemicals based in the region. The legacy of the north's expertise in heavy industry could breed world leaders in new technologies which merge engineering prowess with scientific advances to create sustainable, well-paid jobs in carbon capture and green energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397865605\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350402298533/adams3.jpg\" alt=\"TUC march\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The job centre down the road in Leeds.

But a pipeline out to the gas fields in the North Sea which would have reduced carbon by 40% was cancelled when the \u00a31 million cost proved prohibitive. That saddens Adams: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We could have been a world leader in that technology. We've got <a href=\"http://www.forewind.co.uk/dogger-bank/overview.html\">Doggger Bank</a>, wind and wave power \u2013 loads of platforms on which to build the north's economy with good jobs. Not \u00a36-an-hour jobs but work for engineers, technicians and skilled construction staff.</p> <p>A think tank at Leeds city council recently asked: how are we going to get through the next few years without completely dismantling what the council does? One answer is through encouraging civic entrepreneurism \u2013 relocating companies, getting them to come here and invest in the economic front, taking advantage of the special skills that people in Leeds have in abundance - but also putting something back into the community as part of a long term plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adams worries that:</p> <blockquote> <p>A small elite of people own and run so much and outside of that no-one really has any power, any control over national politics, any stake in the companies or organisations that they work for. There is a sense of hopelessness, but I think that has generated a new type of activism as we've seen with Occupy, with student populations getting political again, fighting back on what has happened to them. A lot of unemployed young people are looking to get involved , to change things.</p> <p>I've noticed how across the region so many groups being set up out of dismay and thinking: we can do something if we get together.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What do you think?

The two men, who are in Japanese police custody, had reportedly been drinking before the alleged incident.</p> <p>The case has come at a particularly sensitive time for relations between the US military and residents in Okinawa, which hosts more than half of the approximately 47,000 US military personnel in Japan.</p> <p>Lingering resentment at the large US military footprint on the island turned to anger recently following the controversial deployment earlier this month of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/01/us-helicopter-fleet-arrives-okinawa-japan\" title=\"\">12 Osprey aircraft at Futenma</a>, a marine corps base located in the middle of a densely populated city.</p> <p>\"This [the rape case] is the worst possible timing,\" Kyodo quoted an aide to the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, as saying, adding that Tokyo had lodged a strong protest with the US authorities.</p> <p>The US ambassador to Japan, John Roos, said in a statement: \"The United States government is extremely concerned by recent allegations of misconduct by two individual United States service members.</p> <p>\"We are committed to co-operating fully with the Japanese authorities in their investigation. These allegations, given their seriousness, will continue to command my full personal attention.\"</p> <p>A Pentagon spokesman said: \"The defence department takes all allegations involving misconduct by service members seriously wherever they may occur.</p> <p>\"The US navy in Japan is focused on co-operating and supporting the Okinawa police investigation.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Okinawa prefecture said the alleged crime was \"unforgivable\" and had \"shocked all Okinawans\".</p> <p>Recent protests against the US military have centred on the Osprey deployment. Residents claim accidents involving the MV-22 Osprey, including two last year, prove the aircraft is too dangerous to fly in built-up areas.</p> <p>The Japanese government, however, approved their deployment this summer after Washington attributed the accidents to pilot error rather than mechanical or design faults. The marines plan to deploy 24 Ospreys at Futenma by 2014.</p> <p>The Osprey's tilt-rotors enable it to take off and land like a helicopter and cruise like conventional aircraft. The US says the fleet at Futenma is needed to replace existing CH-46 transport helicopters and improve its ability to respond to security crises in the Asia-Pacific region amid <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/22/japan-wary-east-china-sea\" title=\"\">growing concern over China's military buildup</a>.</p> <p>Crimes by military personnel are a longstanding cause of tension in Okinawa, which hosts the majority of US bases in Japan. The 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen brought 85,000 people on to the streets in protest and forced Tokyo and Washington to discuss way to reduce the US military presence on the island.</p> <p>Those discussions led to an agreement to relocate the most contentious base, Futenma, but the move has been effectively <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/22/okinawa-airbase-us-japan-delay-switch\" title=\"\">ditched in the face of opposition from residents</a> near the proposed new site along an unspoiled stretch of Okinawan coastline.</p> <p>In 2008, the then secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, was forced to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/28/japan.usa\" title=\"\">apologise during an official visit to Tokyo</a> following the arrest of a US marine for the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl in Okinawa.</p> <p>Opposition to US bases surged again in 2010 after the then prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/02/japan-prime-minister-resigns\" title=\"\">reneged on an election promise to move Futenma off the island altogether</a> after failing to secure an alternative site.</p> <p>According to the public broadcaster NHK, seven US servicemen have been arrested on rape charges since Okinawa reverted to Japanese control 40 years ago.</p>",
  "<p>Senior coalition figures meet on Wednesday for crisis talks about the UK's stalling energy investment program amid growing political concern about the rising cost of customer bills and threats by power station companies to pull out of the UK because of delays.</p> <p>The meeting of what has been dubbed the 'green quad' is expected to set the Conservative-run Treasury against the Liberal Democrat-run energy department, which have been rowing over the issue for months.</p> <p>Sources on both sides of the coalition said that both the prime minister David Cameron and his deputy, the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, were frustated and worried by the continuing dispute, particularly following a series of warnings by major investment companies that they might quit the UK. Just last week seven global electricity and nuclear giants, including Alstom and Mitsubishi, who between them employ tens of thousands of workers, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3561457.ece\" title=\"\">threatened to reassess their investment plans</a> because lack of decision-making and threats to axe key green targets had raised the \"political risk\" of the UK.</p> <p>Cameron and Clegg will meet with the chancellor, George Osborne, and his deputy, the Lib Dem chief financial secretary Danny Alexander - the core quad of top ministers - and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem energy and climate change secretary, for what one senior source warned would be an \"unholy war\" between the Treasury and Davey's department, Decc. The figure, who opposes cutting renewable energy subsidies, said: \"Perhaps Osborne is railing against the climate change act, or perhaps he believes the hype of shale gas.\"</p> <p>A senior Conservative told the Guardian that David Cameron is now personally re-engaging with the green agenda, recognising it as one of the few growing parts of the economy. \"The PM wants to bring the Treasury and Decc on to the same page,\" the source said. \"The Treasury has to sign up to the renewable energy agenda, while Decc has to reassure on costs.\"</p> <p>Clegg on Tuesday acknowledged top level concern about the continuing delays, telling MPs in response to a question about how uncertainty was damaging for investment that: \"This is not just about whether we think it is right for the environment, but about what is right for our economy. The green sector employs close to 1 million people, was growing at about 4% or 5% last year and is one of the few sectors that runs a trade surplus.\"</p> <p>Sources familiar with the negotiations said a likely deal would give the chancellor more leeway on the decision to limit the subsidies that can be charged to energy customers' bills, via an existing power called <a href=\"http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_controlframework_decc.htm\" title=\"\">the levy control framework (LCF)</a>, with a fresh cap currently being negotiated to begin in 2015. In return, Davey would get a new carbon target - to virtually eliminate emissions from electricity generation by 2030 \u2013 written into the energy bill due to be published in early November. That target has had the backing of some major energy companies and the renewable energy industry, and conditional support from the Confederation of British Industry, representing the country's biggest businesses and employers. However, there is growing political pressure over the rising cost of consumer fuel bills - raised again on Tuesday with the powerful consumer group Which? demanding an independent inquiry into whether fuel costs or political policies were pushing them higher and higher.</p> <p>Other negotiating chips on the table include cutting some of the four demonstration plants for carbon capture and storage technology promised in <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/coalition-documents\" title=\"\">the coalition agreement</a>, and the inclusion of pollution from aviation and shipping in the nation's carbon cutting targets.</p> <p>Restricting renewable subsidies via the LCF could mean the UK would be unable to meet its legally binding target to produce 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 from domestic sources. Renewable energy credits would have to be bought in from abroad to make up the shortfall. But one government adviser told the Guardian: \"That is not a credible strategy. You would need to provide credible evidence for where you would get it from and there is no reason to think there will be countries willing to export.\"</p> <p>Tim Yeo, Conservative MP and chair of the influential House of Commons energy and climate change committee, said: \"You can't have a cap on the levy control framework and guarantee meeting the carbon budgets, because no-one knows what the cost of low-carbon energy will be.\"</p> <p>But Yeo said Davey winning a new 2030 carbon target might be the more significant victory. \"The levy control framework will not be an issue for years\" and could be challenged afresh in future, he said. \"The 2030 target would be a win because it will provide more certainty for investors, which is valuable. But it also a very useful building block towards 2014, when there is a review of the carbon budgets. That is a very dangerous time when the government may come under pressure from Conservative backbenchers one year ahead of an election.\"</p>",

That 3 October debate was dominated by Romney and started the president's poll slide, leaving the two in a dead heat less than three weeks from election day.</p> <p>Obama will have lifted Democratic morale and may have done enough to slow \u2013 or even arrest \u2013 the crisis.</p> <p>It will be several days before the first reliable polls appear but a snap poll by CNN awarded the debate 46% to Obama and 39% to Romney, while CBS put it as 37% Obama to 30% Romney.</p> <p>Obama, listless in Denver, was transformed in the second debate: focused, animated and combative. The president grew in confidence in the later stages of the night, while Romney, confident at the start, began to fade.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team said Obama turned in the peformance it had expected him to produce two weeks ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>The former White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, reinstated to the Obama team as an adviser, said: \"The president knew he did not do well two weeks ago. &#xa0;He knew he had to step up his game tonight and Mitt Romney was left looking uncomfortable\".</p> <p>Republicans countered that nothing the president said will have changed the dynamic of the race.</p> <p>Romney and Obama now have a presidential debate victory apiece going into the final one, usually the most watched of the three, in Boca Raton, Florida, on Monday.</p> <p>The two men clashed in the second debate \u2013 at Hofstra University, Long Island \u2013 over tax, energy, women's rights, immigration and Libya.&#xa0;</p> <p>Obama taunted Romney over the vagueness of his plans for tax cuts and deficit reduction.&#xa0;\"If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, 'Here, I want to spend seven or eight trillion dollars, and we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it,' you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal, and neither should you, the American people,\" Obama said.</p> <p>But the most politically damaging moment for Romney came when he bungled his attack on the Obama administration's handling of the assault on the Benghazi consulate in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.&#xa0;</p> <p>It should have been an easy one for Romney, after days of shifting accounts from administration officials who initially blamed the attack on a protest over an Islamophobic film but have now conceded it was a pre-planned terrorist attack.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney accused Obama of flying off on fund-raising trips the day after the Benghazi killings.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Obama came back forcefully, accepting the buck stopped with him, not with Hillary Clinton or anyone else in his administration. \"Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job. But she works for me. I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened.\" He described as \"offensive\" Romney seeking to suggest that as president he was acting out of political motivation over the deaths of four Americans.</p> <p>Then, when Romney tried to challenge the president over his assertion that he had described it as an act of terror on the morning after the attack, the moderator Candy Crowley intervened to say that Obama was correct. \"He did, in fact, sir,\" she told Romney, who was unable to counter-attack.</p> <p>Crowley, CNN's chief political correspondent and the first woman in two decades to moderate a presidential debate,&#xa0;went on to point out that it had taken two weeks for the administration to abandon the idea that the attacks were related to protests over the anti-Muslim video. But her intervention left conservatives furious, with one Republican strategist describing it as the most egregious error by a debate moderator ever.</p> <p>Obama also hit home in an exchange over Romney's investments in China. When the Republican responded that Obama should look at the investments in his own pension, Obama, with his trademark grin, shot back: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours.\"</p> <p>The power of the quip was that it encapsulated the image the Democrats have been labouring to put across of Romney as rich and elitist, in a different league from the majority of Americans. &#xa0;</p> <p>In the final minutes, to the relief of Democrats, Obama also mentioned the secret video in which Romney dismissed 47% of American voters as freeloaders. The president had dismayed Democrats when he failed to raise it in the Denver debate.</p> <p>The format, a town-hall debate with questions from the audience, makes exchanges between the two awkward and supposedly encourages civil exchanges. From the start Obama and Romney dispensed with tradition, rising from their seats to engage first with the questioners and then one another.</p> <p>During a discussion about lack of drilling for oil on federal land, the two could barely contain themselves, confronting one another just a few feet apart, almost eye-balling one another, with Obama saying \"not true\" while Romney insisted it was \"absolutely true\".</p> <p>Until then it was thought the animosity between the two was confined to policy but it became apparent there is also deep personal antipathy. At one point Romney, almost contemptuous of the president, told him: \"You will get your chance in a minute. I am speaking.\" &#xa0;Republicans may view this as Romney standing up to Obama and what they regard as a representative of the liberal media, but the risk is that independents view it as rudeness.</p> <p>In the early exchanges Romney held his own, at one point witheringly telling Obama that whatever he said he would do in his second term, his first term suggested otherwise.&#xa0;</p> <p>But his difficulties began with a question from an audience member over what the candidates would do to improve conditions for working women. He replied by talking about his time as governor of Massachusetts when he appointed many women into cabinet roles and had commissioned a study on women leaders. But he then delivered an unfortunate line when he said that he had looked through \"whole binders full of women\" when seeking to recruit cabinet members as Massachusetts governor.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney also clashed repeatedly with Crowley over the rules and how much time he was being given to answer questions.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the spin room afterwards David Axelrod, Obama's campaign adviser, said Romney had been \"cornered and ran out of the room. &#xa0;It was clear to the American people he was exposed tonight.\"</p> <p>Romney's adviser, Ed Gillespie, said: \"The momentum continues for Governor Romney.\" Asked about Romney's failure to control the debate as he had in Denver, he said: \"I don't think it changes the dynamic. This was never about style. It is about substance \u2013 jobs \u2013 and that has not changed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama had one thing going for him coming into this debate: he couldn't be any worse than the last time. Mitt Romney had one drawback: he apparently couldn't be any better. </p> <p>As it turned out Obama was much better. Clearer, sharper, more decisive and passionate, he challenged Mitt Romney on the facts and rhetorically he overwhelmed him. It was a rout every bit as conclusive as the first debate. Only this time the victor was Obama. Last time he barely showed up; tonight he showed Romney up.</p> <p>Self-assured without being too cocky, focused without being too wonkish, he managed to strike the right balance between being firm with Romney and empathetic with the questioners. There was little of substance that he said that was different; but there was a great deal of difference in the way that he said it.</p> <p>To him were gifted the best lines of the night. When taking on his Republican challenger over his shift from supporting a ban on assault weapons as governor of Massachusetts to opposing them as a presidential candidate, he said: \"He was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.\" </p> <p>When Romney pushed him on investments in his pension funds, asking if he'd seen his pension recently, Obama responded: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.\" </p> <p>When Romney was corrected by the moderator, Candy Crowley, after suggesting that Obama did not call the attack on the US embassy in Benghazi a \"terrorist attack\" Obama shouted with a smile: \"Say it louder, Candy.\"</p> <p>Romney did put up a fight. Approaching the debate with the same style as he did in Denver he brought his best self. Probably his best line came in an answer about why, given the hard times of Obama's first term, he should be trusted with a second. \"We just can't afford another four years like the last four years,\" said Romney. </p> <p>It is difficult to equate the stiff and impersonal figure of the conventions with the man who showed up tonight. But it simply wasn't enough. Indeed, if anything it was too much. For in his effort to reassert the control he enjoyed during the first debate he overreached. </p> <p>Where he once appeared animated he now came off as aggressive. His interruptions looked desperate and his interjections were shrill. In the two weeks since his triumph in Denver he went from persuasive to petulant.</p> <p>The other loser tonight was US politics. Two men circling, talking over each other, drawing on different facts and calling each other liars looked like a metaphor for much that has gone wrong in American political culture over the last generation. Town hall meetings are supposed to be less confrontational. But more caustic than consensual, this was a bad-tempered affair.</p> <p>Obama's performance will energise his base and shore up the doubts of those shaken by his earlier drubbing. It will staunch the bleeding of support towards Romney but it is unlikely to reverse the flow.</p> <p>They called it a town-hall meeting. But in truth there are very few towns like it. It was a room full of undecided voters: the nation is not.</p>",
  "<p>Militia forces from the Libyan city of Misrata <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/26/sirte-hotel-killings-defence-minister\" title=\"\">executed dozens of detainees </a>following the capture and death of Muammar Gaddafi a year ago this week, according to a new report from the group Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>Almost 70 members of the former Libyan dictator's convoy were abused and executed after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/20/gaddafi-dead-says-libyan-pm\" title=\"\">Gaddafi's own capture and death in the city of Sirte</a> last October, the human rights group alleges.</p> <p>The report \u2013 Death of a Dictator: Bloody Vengeance in Sirte \u2013 details Gaddafi's final hours and includes evidence that appears to prove captured pro-Gaddafi fighters caught attempting to leave the city, including Gaddafi's son Mutassim, were murdered.</p> <p>Mutassim was allegedly killed after being taken to Misrata, which suffered a months-long siege by pro-government troops. He had been filmed alive in the city earlier in the day, but later footage showed him dead from a fresh wound to the throat not visible in the first video after his capture.</p> <p>Also killed, investigators believe, were at least 66 other members of the convoy, executed at the nearby Mahari Hotel.</p> <p>While both sides committed atrocities, including murder, during the Libyan war's last battle, which saw some of the heaviest street fighting, this would be the worst single incident attributed to the coalition of anti-government militias.</p> <p>Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said: \"The evidence suggests that opposition militias summarily executed at least 66 captured members of Gaddafi's convoy in Sirte.\"</p> <p>The claims by the group are deeply embarrassing for Nato members that backed the rebel campaign to oust Gaddafi with a no-fly zone. That action \u2013 supported by Russia \u2013 was authorised because of fears that government forces might massacre civilians.</p> <p>However, the apparent confirmation that anti-government militia forces were also responsible for war crimes that have yet to be investigated will once again raise serious questions over the nature of some of the groups backed by the west and its allies, some of whom have continued to fuel instability in the country.</p> <p>\"In case after case we investigated, the individuals had been videotaped alive by the opposition fighters who held them, and then found dead hours later,\" Bouckaert said. \"Our strongest evidence for these executions comes from the footage filmed by the opposition forces, and the physical evidence at the Mahari Hotel, where the 66 bodies were found.\"</p> <p>\"It also looks as if they took Mutassim Gaddafi, who had been wounded, to Misrata and killed him there. Our findings call into question the assertion by Libyan authorities that Muammar Gaddafi was killed in crossfire, and not after his capture.\"</p> <p>Among the most powerful new evidence is a mobile phone video clip filmed by opposition militia members that shows a large group of captured convoy members in detention, being cursed at and abused.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch used hospital morgue photos to establish that at least 17 of the detainees visible in the phone video were later executed at the Mahari Hotel.</p> <p>Under the laws of war, the killing of captured combatants is a war crime, and Libyan civilian and military authorities have an obligation to investigate war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>A Human Rights Watch research team was nearby when Gaddafi's convoy engaged in its final battle with opposition forces, on 20 October 2011.</p> <p>Following the battle, the research team visited the site and found more than 100 bodies, most killed in combat.</p> <p>Two days later, the Human Rights Watch research team found the decomposing remains of at least 53 people at the nearby Mahari Hotel, some with their hands still bound behind their backs.</p> <p>To document fully what had occurred on 20 October, the team interviewed officers in opposition militias who were at the scene, as well as surviving members of the Gaddafi convoy at the hospital, in custody, and in private homes.</p> <p>The group also reviewed a large number of video recordings made by opposition forces on their mobile phones, some of which show captured detainees at the site of the final battle. Using Sirte hospital morgue records, Human Rights Watch researchers were able to establish the identities of 17 people last seen alive in custody whose bodies were recovered at the Mahari Hotel.</p> <p>Among those executed was Ahmed Ali Yusuf al-Ghariyani, 29, a navy recruit originally from Tawergha. In a phone video that is believed to show him in captivity after the battle, militia forces beat, kick and throw shoes at him, and taunt him about being from Tawergha, a town seen as being loyal to Gaddafi. Ghariyani's body was later found at the Mahari Hotel, and was photographed by hospital staff and buried as unidentified body number 86. He was later identified by family members from the photographs taken by the hospital staff.</p> <p>Journalists who covered the battle for Sirte also saw detainees being abused after their capture.</p>",
