Hassan saw severed heads and limbs lying in pools of sticky blood following the shelling of a funeral. Mohammed's skin and hair caught fire when a nearby car exploded. Kareem's next-door neighbour was killed by a shell as she nursed her baby. Moussa was kept in a prison cell alongside decomposing bodies. Eleven-year-old Mohamed writes poems about death and freedom.</p> <p>In the bleak, windswept landscape of the rapidly swelling Za'atari camp and the overcrowded towns and villages of northern Jordan, child refugees from Syria are struggling to cope with the weight of their experiences during 18 months of bloodshed.</p> <p>Some are haunted by the deaths of relatives, friends and neighbours. Some hear the sound of shelling and shooting constantly replaying in their heads. Many have seen their homes and communities turned to rubble. A few have been abused or tortured in detention. Some exhibit the physical scars of conflict. Almost all bear the psychological scars.</p> <p>Children have flooded across the border from Syria in recent weeks, most in family groups but an increasing number making the difficult and dangerous journey without a parent or close relative. At Za'atari, where dust-caked tents stretch in long rows across a vast desert plain, children are up to two-thirds of the current population of 31,000 refugees.</p> <p>\"They are paying the highest price. We have seen a lot of psycho-social distress, behavioural problems,\" says Nadine Haddad of <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/syria\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a>, which is launching a campaign to draw attention to the plight of children caught up in the conflict. Adolescent boys tend towards aggression and even vandalism; younger children suffer nightmares and bed-wetting.</p> <p>According to Michele Servadei of Unicef, the number of unaccompanied children arriving at Za'atari has increased to more than 20 a week. Some are completely alone; some have been sent by their parents to travel with neighbours or extended family members. \"Most are boys between 14 and 18, but we are also now getting some girls \u2013 a symptom that things are getting worse, more families are being disrupted.\"</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396604258\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/24/1348494714777/Nur-nine-lives-in-a-refug-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/24/120924Nursavechildren-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/24/120924Nursavechildren_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120924Nursavechildren/120924Nursavechildren.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/24/120924Nursavechildren_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>These children are part of a bigger picture. The UN says a total of more than 280,000 Syrian citizen have registered as refugees or are awaiting registration after fleeing to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. But there are tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands more outside the camps and formal process of registration. Aid agencies, host countries and small communities are struggling to cope with the influx.</p> <p>Ohood, a 14-year-old from east Deraa, made the journey to Jordan a month ago with her parents and seven of her siblings. The Free Syrian Army escorted the group to a point close to the Syrian border. \"We had to walk in the dark for three hours, very slowly and quietly,\" she says while washing clothes in a bucket by a standpipe. \"It was hard for the little children.\" They arrived in Jordan at 2am.</p> <p>Her family left after repeated shelling of their neighbourhood. \"One day we were at school, about 50 children in an Arabic lesson, sitting at our desks. There were clashes with the FSA, and they got mad and started shooting.\" Asked who \"they\" were, she says: \"[President] Bashar's security.</p> <p>\"It was very frightening. All the children started running away, trying to escape. The shooting lasted about an hour.\" A few days later the family fled to Jordan.</p> <p>Kareem, a 14-year-old with a cherubic face, mimics the sound of shells and gunfire while describing attacks on his and his neighbours' homes. \"I could hear the rockets passing our house. Next door to us a woman was hit by shrapnel in her chest while nursing her baby. Three children also died. We stayed in the bedroom of our house, about 30 or more of us. The bombing went on all night.\"</p> <p>He pulls up the leg of his jeans to show burn scars on his leg. \"There were fires in the street, they were burning petroleum. I was running because I thought a tank was coming. I fell into a fire.\" Kareem was taken to a field hospital for basic treatment, but a year on his leg still causes pain. Despite his ready smile, he anxiously pulls at his lower lip while describing what happened.</p> <p>Making constant gunfire noises, Kareem follows us through the rows of flapping tents to find Mohamed. An engaging 11-year-old writer of poetry, he arrived at Za'atari camp around a month ago, shortly before his mother gave birth to Mohamed's new brother. The baby, he says, is \"skinny and doesn't nurse. We're all sick from the dust, we can't breathe normally.\"</p> <p>Shortly before they left their home in Deraa province, a bullet whizzed in through a window and smashed through a cake his mother had made to break the Ramadan fast. Mohamed and his siblings usually hid in a cupboard when the shooting started.</p> <p>One of Mohamed's poems is a tribute to a man called Nathem, \"the first person to die in our town. He was on a protest, throwing rocks, and the soldiers started shooting.\" Another poem is, he says, about freedom. He recites the opening lines: \"Homs is on fire, and all of Syria went to its aid.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/25/syrian-refugee-omar-video\">Omar's story: 'I was sleeping when the shell fell' \u2013 video</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/25/syrian-child-refugee-bisan-video\">Bisan's story: 'It was a massacre' \u2013 video</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/25/syrian-child-refugee-emmad-video\">Emmad's story: 'The mountain route was risky' \u2013 video</a></p> <p>It is hard to keep track of children in Za'atari despite the best efforts of aid agencies. Plans to use colour-coding and symbols to identify different parts of the camps have yet to be implemented; and in any case the relentless sand and dust swiftly turn everything a uniform brown. Younger children frequently get lost; older ones sometimes sneak out past the camp's fences and armed guards, or simply disappear within the massive compound. We spend an hour fruitlessly searching for Moussa, a 15-year-old who lives alone in the camp, one of more than 200 unaccompanied minors registered since Za'atari opened on 29 July. His mother and two brothers are also in Jordan but, as Syrians, they are not permitted to pay \"bail\" money to get Moussa out of the camp so he can join them. Moussa told Save the Children that he had fought with the FSA, and was imprisoned for 22 days after being captured by the Syrian military. \"I was tortured and I saw children dying. I've got scars on my feet, chest and back. There were hundreds of us in prison. I was in a big cell with other children. The youngest ones were nine or 10, they had been captured during protests. I was beaten up every day, and they used electricity too.\"</p> <p>His interrogators wanted information about the FSA, he said. \"But I never told them.\"</p> <p>He said there were dead bodies in his cell. \"They'd been there a long time, and they stank. They were decomposing, there were maggots.\"</p> <p>A young man in the tent in which Moussa had been sleeping tells us the boy has gone to the \"new camp\", a vast area of expansion where tents are being erected in anticipation of thousands of arrivals over the coming weeks. Delivery trucks and bulldozers constantly churn up the sand into choking clouds, which are then fanned by the relentless wind.</p> <p>The tents are mostly bare, with foam mattresses laid on groundsheets. Most families left their homes with minimal possessions; many of the children have only the clothes they are wearing. The temperature is already dropping after dark; soon it will be bitterly cold at night.</p> <p>Aid workers say the camp inmates feel humiliated by their new living conditions. \"Their passports are confiscated, they are forced to eat whatever they're given, they wash their clothes in a bucket, they have nothing to do all day. There is a lack of dignity. It's like being in prison,\" said one. Some refugees are even asking to return to Syria.</p> <p>Save the Children, Unicef and other agencies have established \"child friendly spaces\" where children can play and take part in therapeutic activities, such as drawing and painting. \"They express their feelings and what they've seen in different ways,\" says Haddad of Save the Children. \"Some draw happy families. Some draw Syria. Some focus on horrific things. Each child has his or her way.\"</p> <p>Jordan's burgeoning refugee crisis does not end at the camp's perimeter fence. In addition to the 31,000 people in Za'atari camp, there are an estimated 140,000 Syrian refugees living in towns and villages in northern Jordan. Many extended families stretch across both sides of the border, and some refugees are crowding in with relatives. Others are renting apartments in cities such as Ramthe, Mafraq and Irbid.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396612409\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/24/1348503016854/Hassan-is-14-years-old-an-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/24/120924Hassanchildren-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/24/120924Hassanchildren_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120924Hassanchildren/120924Hassanchildren.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Hassan, a 14-year-old from Zaynab, near Damascus, and a further eight members of his family have squashed into a relative's house in Mafraq a few weeks after fleeing Syria in the aftermath of what he describes as \"a massacre in our town\".</p> <p>According to his account, Syrian helicopters fired rockets at a night-time funeral for an FSA fighter. \"There were about 5,000 people. I was at the edge of the funeral.\" The mourners were making a lot of noise, he says, but when the rockets hit, \"there was no sound\".</p> <p>\"There were bodies, and pieces of bodies, everywhere. Everyone was looking for relatives. Everyone was scared because there were helicopters still in the sky. I saw heads 20 metres away from the blast. I saw arms and legs that had been cut from bodies. There was lots of blood everywhere. Before I go to sleep at night, I always remember what happened that day.\"</p> <p>Hassan's uncle and cousin were among the dead. \"We found their bodies in the mosque.\" He adds: \"Everybody from young to old hates Bashar.\"</p> <p>He has not been able to start school in Jordan, although he is trying to register. Local schools are struggling with the refugee influx, and aid agencies are trying to help with prefabricated classrooms and textbooks. They are also encouraging teachers among the refugee population to volunteer to work. In Za'atari camp alone, there are up to 10,000 school-age children \u2013 the equivalent of 10 average-sized secondary schools in the UK.</p> <p>\"Many children have lost months or even years of schooling,\" says Servadei of Unicef. School is not only essential from an educational point of view but also to provide children with a sense of routine and occupation. Boredom is one of the biggest problems for refugee children.</p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Mohammed, now living with a relative in Irbid, would also like to restart his education. \"I want to register but they have told me the schools are full. It's boring. I just go for walks around the town.\"</p> <p>Before leaving Syria, Mohammed was involved in the FSA. \"We used to help them, but I was not fighting myself. We would scout roads and refill ammo. There were younger children than me going out with the FSA, as young as 10.\"</p> <p>Youngsters, he says, were involved in the uprising from the beginning. A protest in his home town of Deraa, initiated by schoolchildren, led to the arrest of about 50. \"They were taken to jail. They had their fingernails pulled out, they were beaten with sticks. Some lost their minds.\" Some of the children were as young as six, he says.</p> <p>\"A lot of children have been killed. My friends, my cousins.\"</p> <p>Mohammed intends to go back to Syria to join the fight, but first needs treatment for burns on his face and body, which have left him extensive scarring and pain. \"I was standing next to a car, which was hit. There was a big fire. I was burned all over. It was like a dream. Then I passed out.\"</p> <p>He crossed to Jordan alone around six weeks ago, going first to Za'atari camp and now staying with a relative in Irbid. His family is still in Deraa. \"I miss them. I can't stay here while my family might be killed. I want to go back. I'm no longer afraid of anything.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/syriagive\" title=\"\"><em>Save the Children in Syria</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Mr Luthra, the shopkeeper in my local market who sells me ancient imported cheese, packets of sliced salami and a variety of other once-scarce western delicacies that he produces like some kind of illicit contraband from a fridge buried in the back of his store, has views on many subjects.</p> <p>Oddly, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/21/indian-life-extinguished-by-supermarkets\" title=\"\">new measure</a> brought in by the Indian government last week to allow foreign supermarket chains to sell directly to customers rather than retailers such as him is not among them. Though he is one of the millions of small businessmen who critics of the new measure say are likely to lose their livelihoods, Mr Luthra is unconcerned, even when told Walmart has said it hopes to open a&#xa0;store in India within a year to 18 months.</p> <p>\"I have been here 30 years. I know everybody. They know me. How can some American compete with that?\" he asks.</p> <p>Fly into Delhi and you'll arrive at the international airport's new terminal building, opened&#xa0;in 2010. It is a vast sprawl of glass, steel and orange&#xa0;carpets, and it is busy 24/7. It is a concrete \u2013 in every sense of the word \u2013 manifestation of what 20 years of sustained economic growth can produce. Since a package of reforms designed largely by the then finance minister Manmohan Singh was implemented in the early&#xa0;90s, India \u2013 or rather, some Indians \u2013 have enjoyed the effects of an economy expanding by&#xa0;up to 9% each year. The amount that has trickled down to the most needy may have been&#xa0;derisory, but that huge sums of cash have been created is undeniable. A recent report from the Indian National Council of Applied Economic Research quoted in the local Hindustan Times said that the famous <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/WorldEconomy/Pleasure-pain-generation/Article1-934181.aspx\" title=\"\">\"Indian middle class\"</a> grew&#xa0;from 2.7% of the population in 1995-96 to&#xa0;nearly 13% today.</p> <p>Leave the airport and within a few minutes you&#xa0;will have really entered India. The roads are&#xa0;chaotic, clogged and pitted, a new tunnel ends&#xa0;beside a shanty town and the new Metro link to the airport is broken. All the gaps in&#xa0;India's growth story \u2013 so often ignored in&#xa0;the west and elsewhere \u2013 are glaringly obvious. The most recent batch of Indian reforms, introduced by the very same Manmohan Singh, now prime minister, is inspired by the fear that these holes will swallow all the progress of the past decade if drastic action is not&#xa0;taken soon.</p> <p>Whether they are implemented could determine if India's growth picks up&#xa0;again, whether it continues to flatline or whether it continues to slow, with India set back several decades in shortish order.</p> <p>Up in South Block, part of the monumental red&#xa0;sandstone complex designed by the British to house their administrative staff in the centre of what they called New Delhi, close aides explain that Singh's sudden courage stems neither from fears of further loss of confidence in international markets, nor from concern over his \"legacy\", but&#xa0;from victory in an internal battle within his&#xa0;own party.</p> <p>The ruling Congress party has long been split between those favouring economic policies that owe much to the decades of socialist-style central&#xa0;planning and those looking to boost private-sector growth and foreign investment and&#xa0;cut back state spending. But first came a change in finance minister and then the party president Sonia Gandhi was convinced by Singh that unless some money was generated soon, the&#xa0;various big dole schemes she believes are essential to improving the lot of India's poor (and&#xa0;her party's electoral chances) could not be&#xa0;funded.</p> <p>\"It's understood now that without money there is no welfare,\" an aide to the prime minister&#xa0;says. \"There are many more [reforms] to&#xa0;come.\"</p> <p>This is a huge shift, in a country that is home to around a fifth of the world's population. But the problem is that the most recent reforms, though impressive in the context, are less so in the grand economic scheme of things. They may bring in a little more investment and reassure the markets, but they won't tackle the real fundamental bottlenecks that are stifling growth \u2013 runaway public expenditure or the soaring inflation that punishes the poor most. For this, lots of new legislation is needed. Even the PM's loyal aide, particularly as last week's announcements cost the government a coalition partner, admits that new laws are impossible.</p> <p>The result then is that India, at least until the next election in 2014 and almost certainly beyond, will not see the deep reform needed to return to high growth. It will putter on at 6% at best. A lot by current western standards, but economists here say it is only just about enough to meet&#xa0;the current needs of the growing population.</p> <p>Outside the prime minister's office, the sun is slanting across the stupendous vista down towards the India Gate. It&#xa0;is the first evening that is cool enough to convince me that the brutal&#xa0;summer is once more over. Children play, exhausted labourers sleep under trees, couples are strolling on the thick, monsoon rain-watered grass and the sellers of street snacks are doing brisk business. Like Mr Luthra, no one&#xa0;seems very worried about the imminent arrival of Walmart.</p>",
  "<p>It is said there's someone for everyone. Who would have predicted, when Todd Akin, the Republican representative, was abandoned by his party for his \"legitimate rape\" comments a month ago, Newt Gingrich would be his knight in shining armour.</p> <p>But at the first major fundraising event held by the Akin campaign since the Missouri senate candidate was blackballed by the party funders and leaders, Gingrich pledged his support and said he was just the first in a wave of well-known Republicans to stand by Akin.</p> <p>Republican party leaders have said the controversial remarks have made it impossible for Akin to unseat incumbent US senator Claire McCaskill. They have pleaded with him to step down in time to name a replacement for the election.</p> <p>Gingrich came to Missouri on Monday to back Akin at a $500-a-ticket fundraising lunch, at which he addressed about 50 of the congressman's supporters \u2013 and earlier, the media.</p> <p>At at a press conference at a train station in Kirkwood, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, Gingrich said Akin was running a winnable race and made his own prediction \u2013 that the national Republican leaders, including Mitt Romney, would reverse track and back the candidate once they \"adjust to the reality\" that he is staying in the race.</p> <p>\"If Todd and the people of Missouri prove it's a close race, what's the moral case for not backing the Republican nominee?\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>Gingrich told the crowd, made up of reporters and a handful of supporters that it all came down to a simple question. \"Do you want to keep Harry Reid as the majority leader?\" Gingrich said to shouts of \"No\" from Akin supporters.</p> <p>Gaining McCaskill's seat is seen as vital if the GOP is to take over the Senate in November. \"How do you go back to your donors and say: 'Let's throw the Senate away?',\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>The former presidential candidate dismissed comments on Sunday by Republican national committee chairman Reince Preibus who declared on TV that there was no way any RNC money would be used to help Akin. \"My expectation would be that in the crunch, in October, governor Romney is going to be for the entire ticket, and he's going to be for Todd Akin,\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>He compared Akin to Harry Truman, senator and later president who was dumped by the party machine in the 1940s.</p> <p>The fundraiser would have netted Akin up to $42,000 from the cost of the tickets alone, in addition to the $600,000 Akin has already raised online.<br>Rick Tyler, a former longterm aide to Gingrich, who is now advising Akin, said he had \"adequate funding\" to fight the election.</p> <p>The polls are showing a close contest, and Tuesday is the last day that Akin could seek a court order to drop out. On Monday, he reaffirmed that he had no plans to withdraw, telling supporters that a number of prominent Republicans have already agreed to campaign on his behalf but declining to name names. He begins a four-day \"Common Sense\" bus tour.</p> <p>Akin has aplogised for the remarks on \"legitimate rape\" he made in a televised interview and has even drummed up a \"Women for Akin\" group. <a href=\"http://www.akin.org/campaign/missouri-women-stand-todd-akin\">A video on his website</a> has one woman weeping as she recounted having an abortion as she endorses the pro-life candidate she said speaks up for women.</p> <p>His supporters say he a mistake and should be forgiven for it. Paula Ritter, 78, who was at Kirkwood station with her husband to support Akin said he and other politicians needed to learn \"who they are talking to\". \"I think he's sorry. But I don't think he's sorry for thinking that\" she said. Ritter said she didn't agree with him \"but I wouldn't change my vote because of it. I'm not for single-issue politics\".</p> <p>Gingrich joked: \"if saying something dumb disqualifies you, Joe Biden couldn't be vice-president.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396631025\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348525557579/gingrich-akin-protests-010.jpg\" alt=\"gingrich akin protests\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">About 50 people gathered outside the fundraiser to protest Akin's candidacy.

One held up a banner which said: \"Lets shut Todd Akin down\" in reference to his comments that rape victims had a way of \"shutting down\" pregnancies.</p> <p>Jane Von Kaenel said his remarks had re-invigorated the feminist base in Missouri. \"He's an embarrassment, he's out of touch,\" she said of Akin. \"You just can't hold your nose and get away from the smell.\" She said she thought that \"many, many\" Republicans would vote for McCaskill.</p> <p>Susan Cunningham, 73, a retired teacher from Pacific, in Franklin, Missouri, who was holding the banner declaring \"Let's shut down Todd Akin\" said she was worried about Republican party becoming more and more conservative on social issues. She said: \"I'm very worried about what is happening in this country. I'm against Todd Akin's voting record on everything, from women's issues, to the environment and education.\"</p> <p>\"I don't understand why Newt Gingrich is supporting him, but to be honest I don't understand why Newt Gingrich does anything. Newt must have an ulterior motive. They are blowing smoke and they are very good at it. But Todd Akin is scary. When I think of my daughter and my grandchildren, are they going to have access to birth control of are they going to have to put a veil on? It's crazy here, we are going backwards.\"</p> <p>Gingrich refused to say what conversations he had with the party leadership that led him to predict a u-turn on Akin.</p> <p>Asked if anyone from the party had tried to stop him from coming out in support of Akin, he said: \"I'm not going to talk about my conversations with party leadership.\"</p> <p>Tyler, a former long-term aide to Gingrich who now works for Akin, said he thought the candidate would raise an \"adequate amount\" of money to stay in the race, but added that he believed if would be \"political malpractice\" if the Republican party did not get back behind him.</p> <p>Marsha Walker, a social worker from Chesterfield, who attended the fundraiser, said she hoped the voters would forgive Akin his remarks. She said she was voting for him because of his strong pro-life views.</p> <p>\"Everyone who has spoken has erred in some way, and not to forgive is unforgivable. We need someone like Todd to fight for morality in Washington, and Todd is s a fighter.\"</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday tens of thousands of Libyans demonstrated in a rally in Benghazi against the Islamist militias which they blamed for the attack on the US consulate last week. Eleven people died in the fighting that ensued and for a while it was assumed by some that a corner had been turned, as several groups abandoned their bases. Ansar al-Shariah and the Abu Salim brigade disbanded and left their bases in Derna, east of Benghazi. Libya's prime minister-elect Mustafa Abushagur said that eight Libyans had been arrested in connection with the death of US ambassador Chris Stevens. The president of the new parliament and de facto head of state, Muhammad Magariaf, issued <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/libyan-authorities-islamist-militia\" title=\"\">a deadline </a>by which all unauthorised militia would be shut down: midnight on Monday.</p> <p>It did not take long before reality dawned. On Monday other Islamist militias, notably the Rafallah al-Sahati, claiming to operate under Tripoli's authority, began a round up of the Benghazi protesters whom they accused of instigating violence. Among those detained were 30 military officers. Many of these militias played a key role in the uprising which destroyed Muammar Gaddafi's regime. The glue that held them together, the common cause of liberating Libya from a family-run tyranny, is now gone and it is left to thousands of volunteer mediators \u2013 also armed \u2013 to keep the peace between them.</p> <p>The death of Stevens has revealed the fault lines of this process. For while Libya has successfully navigated elections in July and the selection of a compromise candidate as prime minster, it is still far from approaching a functioning state. Security is a local franchise held by firmly established militias. The national army and police force are weak in comparison \u2013 as we are witnessing in Benghazi. Which leaves the government in Tripoli struggling to control the state both politically and geographically.</p> <p>Eastern Libya, which accounts for 80% of the oil production, is not just home to long-established Islamist groups, among them militant Salafis and Takfiris, which sent fighters off to Iraq and Afghanistan. It has long been an advocate of <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/2012/09/19/struggle-for-security-in-eastern-libya/dvct\" title=\"\">federalism and local autonomy</a>. The selection of Magariaf as head of parliament, a man who hails from Ajdabiya in the east, was intended as a signal of provincial inclusion. All these pressures could bubble to the surface again if civil unrest continues in Benghazi.</p> <p>The US is still trying to recover from the blow of the sacking of its consulate, which had many more US nationals than it claimed on its books, or was necessary for its operation. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/world/africa/attack-in-libya-was-major-blow-to-cia-efforts.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_moc.semityn.www\" title=\"\">A whole CIA operation</a> was based in the lightly guarded embassy annex which came under attack.

Repeatedly decimated in the local elections, derided on both the left and the right, and down in the opinion polls \u2013 this morning's 14% in ICM masks an average of 10% among <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/\" title=\"\">all polls</a> \u2013 it is not hard to imagine the Lib Dems coming to their autumn conference as a sullen and even mutinous crew, increasingly anxious to set a new course under a different skipper into easier waters.</p> <p>In reality, the mood at<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live\" title=\"\"> Brighton</a> is proving steadier than many outsiders expected. But it is not a naive mood. The Lib Dem party signed up for a difficult but exciting voyage into the unknown under Captain Clegg in 2010. In spite of the damage they have suffered, they remain willing to continue serving under him on his terms. It is, after all, a long voyage. Plenty of the crew certainly mutter that First Officer Cable would make a better helmsman. But though that muttering is on the increase, it is also only heard in private. The Lib Dems are a disciplined lot and they seem to sense that this question, though potentially a relevant and important one, is for later. This is a long voyage. They are not about to abandon ship.</p> <p>Mr Cable knows all this. His<a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/press_releases_detail.aspx?title=\" vince_cable%e2%80%99s_speech_to_liberal_democrat_autumn_conference&amp;ppk=\"9abfab04-a8da-4775-be1b-0708a77581a3&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\"> speech</a> on Monday was that of a man who would certainly like to do things differently in many ways. When he said the central point was that the country must not get stuck on a downward escalator in which low growth leads to bigger deficits, more cuts and lower growth, calling this \"the way to economic disaster and political oblivion\", it was a shot across the bows of George Osborne and perhaps even some Liberal Democrat ministers too. When he invoked \"liberal and social democratic principles\" and said the party should be willing \"to work with other parties in the wider national interest\", it was clear he was not just talking about working with the Conservatives.</p> <p>Mr Cable also delivered the speech of a man who has certainly not given up on the possibility of leading his party, but who wants to choose his moment, if it comes at all, and to keep hold of a situation which could rapidly spin out of control if he says or does anything to encourage a premature explosion. That intention was evident in the conference economic debate yesterday, in which ministers and party heavyweights repeatedly came to the microphone to oppose any attempt to scrap the coalition's fiscal commitments.</p> <p>Their efforts were overwhelmingly successful when the issue came to the vote, yet the difference between the desire for sustainable growth expressed by the defeated minority in the debate and the desire for sustainable growth expressed by Mr Cable and the majority is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19699661\" title=\"\">more than a little cryptic</a>. The conclusion, pretty clearly, is that the party leadership wants to retain strict control over any such moves \u2013 not to allow the conference to set things running.</p> <p>Fair enough. A lot could go wrong if the public and the markets think the Lib Dems are suddenly running away from their coalition agreement. Yet the Lib Dems still have to find a way of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-lib-dems-dilemma\" title=\"\">differentiating their economic message</a> to the public. There was plenty of that in Mr Cable's deft and well-balanced speech.</p> <p>But the Lib Dems are a political party that has to face the voters again in 2015. Unless they have a better story to tell the voters, they are going to suffer some pretty serious losses, as all the polls, including the ICM poll this morning, underline. That's why the possibility that Mr Cable might save seats that at the moment look likely to be lost under Mr Clegg is not an idle one.</p> <p>This morning's poll shows that a change of leader might offer the Lib Dems an electoral dividend that could make a palpable difference. Perhaps they can afford to resist that thought now. But if things have not changed in a year's time, it will be harder to do the same thing then.</p>",
  "<p>'<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122721278056345271.html\" title=\"\">You never want a serious crisis to go to waste</a>,\" Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama's chief of staff,&#xa0;quipped in late 2008 as Wall Street descended into chaos in the waning days of the Bush presidency and the new administration prepared its response. Four years on, many influential figures in Europe feel the same way, judging from president of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso's widely discussed call this month for closer integration and \"<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/president/news/archives/2012/09/20120912_1_en.htm\" title=\"\">a democratic federation of nation states</a>\".</p> <p>Europe's handling of the crisis to date has been nothing if not faltering and disjointed. According to a recent paper by economist Edwin Truman at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, the lack of timely co-operation among members of the eurozone has <a href=\"http://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime/?p=3001\" title=\"\">led to a shortfall in world output of about $1.1 trillion</a>, of which Europe itself has suffered $730 billion \u2013 more than 3% of its total GDP.</p> <p>But what kind of opportunity has the sovereign debt crisis provided? The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/european-central-bank-powers-grow\" title=\"\">newly enhanced role of the European Central Bank</a> has emerged as a firefighting measure, a means of damping down the flames and calming the markets. Beyond this, both Barroso and German chancellor Angela Merkel see the muddling through of the&#xa0;last two years as a prelude to a necessary longer term strengthening of European solidarity through new institutions and&#xa0;powers at the European level: a union-wide system of banking supervision to begin with; later, perhaps, some kind of European treasury or finance ministry, a greater pooling of border policing, and a leap forward to the kind of co-ordinated diplomacy that will allow the EU to punch at its weight on the international stage.</p> <p>Of course, a large number of people in Europe will resist any further drift towards federation. To Eurosceptics, the&#xa0;new proposals simply confirm the omnipresent nightmare of a superstate in the making. They see both the commission and the German chancellery as embarked on a long-term power grab, and they have no time for Barroso's argument that, in the age of globalisation, pooled sovereignty means greater power for individual members. Indeed the nationalist response across Europe is to claim the opposite \u2013 to insist that both political virtue and economic interest demand a halt to integration and a reassertion of the powers of national legislatures.</p> <p>They are perhaps half right. For Europe's dilemma is a historically unparalleled one. The intense pace of global financial integration during the last 30 years poses an acute political challenge. Can the members of the union, traditionally so wedded to their national institutions, keep these intact and remain globally influential? Not even the Germans would have the kind of standing they now enjoy if the union were to disintegrate.</p> <p>So here is the rub. Economically, there can be little doubt that some sort of enhanced co-ordination is desirable for Europeans to prosper in a multipolar world. But politically, the likely outcome is a further shift in power from&#xa0;elected representatives to unelected technocrats and a further weakening of democracy; and greater powers for bankers at the European Central Bank and lawyers at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/european-court-of-justice\" title=\"\">European court of justice</a> \u2013 along with the civil servants in Brussels who interpret&#xa0;their judgments.</p> <p>The 11 EU foreign ministers who last week put out a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/eu-foreign-defence-policy-overhaul?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">report on the future of Europe</a> are alive to this danger. They want the European parliament to be consulted more, and they talk about improving democratic legitimacy. But they are short on ideas for doing this, and their proposal to streamline European decision-making by reducing member states' veto powers pushes further in the opposite direction. As for a powerful directly elected European president \u2013 another of their proposals \u2013 this might attract voter interest but would still be only tangentially connected to the political parties which dominate national politics.</p> <p>The eurozone crisis has made this conflict between the logics of global economics and national politics emerge starkly. In the early years of the euro, electorates were willing by and large to pool sovereignty, and hence give up their right to be consulted, when the payoff was greater prosperity and mobility. But if austerity measures leave the continent floundering in a Japanese-style recession for the next decade, all bets are off. In such circumstances, with&#xa0;high levels of unemployment across much of southern and eastern Europe, electoral sentiment may move sharply away from Brussels and demand instead that their politicians protect their national economies.</p> <p>In short, unless there is a plan for integration that prioritises recovery and growth, what we may end up with is not a Europe that is a \"democratic federation of nation states\" at all but a gradual unwinding of the entire integration process. A prospect to make some Eurosceptics rejoice, no doubt, but replete with dangers of its own.</p> <p>Europeans thus have a tough choice to make: the historic preservation of their national institutions, or greater co-operation and derogation of powers. If, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/holland-new-coaliton-eu-caution\" title=\"\">Dutch elections suggested last month</a>, they would still mostly opt for the latter then the real argument becomes about the nature of the new institutions, their powers and the philosophy behind them.</p> <p>This is where the battle is now joined&#xa0;\u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>'s pro-growth France battles Merkel's inflation-obsessed Germany, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi\" title=\"\">Mario&#xa0;Draghi's European Central Bank</a> tussles with the German Bundesbank. It is the critical struggle for anyone concerned with the preservation of the European model of social welfare. What a sad commentary on the state of British diplomacy that what David Cameron's government thinks about this remains entirely irrelevant.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>After several years of calumny related to its business in sex-related classified advertising, the company that owns the Village Voice, as well as a collection of other papers that used to be called the alternative press, has decided to sell the papers and keep the lucrative sex ads. In truth, this is more legerdemain than actual transaction, and nothing but some corporate filings will likely change. But put that aside for the moment.</p> <p>The Village Voice and other like-minded papers have always been supported in part by sex ads. In the case of the Voice, that's more than 60 years of sex ads. Indeed, the Voice's ads might fairly be said to have helped make the world safe for a remarkable variety of fetishes.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch bought the Voice in 1977, in part because he recognized that the Voice's famous back page, where its sex ads appeared, yielded one of the highest per line rates in the world of classified advertising (every newspaper's most profitable revenue source). Helped by those sex ads, he sold the Voice in 1985 for vastly more than he'd bought it, and financed his acquisition of 20th Century Fox. </p> <p>While the papers themselves have long been faltering as revenue generators, the sex ad business has continued to be a reliable producer. From time to time, there have been main street outbursts against this raunchiness, mostly redounding to the brand value of the Voice and other alternative titles. But it is really only now, after all these years \u2013 at a time when sex service advertising is as ubiquitous and available online as oxygen \u2013 that main street censure has really scored a direct hit. This opprobrium has involved a sustained campaign by media, politicians, and amorphous citizen groups directed against the company's management, investors, and advertisers.</p> <p>So why now? And about what exactly?</p> <p>The ostensible charge is sexual perniciousness: the Voice and its advertising, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/kristof-where-pimps-peddle-their-goods.html?gwh=CEFF16E95D6F6E0FCACF4E43396BEAA3\">say critics</a>, aids sex trafficking. The evidence here is awfully slim, but sex-trafficking is one of those phrases, like weapons of mass destruction, that requires little factual support. Who isn't against sex-trafficking \u2013 even if its exact definition and operation is elusive? </p> <p>The Voice's foremost antagonist is <a href=\"http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/responding-to-village-voice-on-sex-trafficking/\">Nicholas Kristof, a New York Times op-ed columnist</a>, which has rather set the weight of the liberal establishment against the company and its ads. Kristof is an unfortunate enemy. Alone on the op-ed page in his lack of style, specialty, or point of view, he has compensated by adopting a mission with the greatest zeal: he's a one-man NGO for girls forced into prostitution in Africa. Trying to push his campaign into America (encouraged, no doubt, by his editors to ground his story a little closer to home), he's focused on the Voice. </p> <p>His are highly personalized columns in which Kristof introduces us to a particular victim \u2013 someone he has gotten to know and who he's taken a personal interest in helping to save \u2013 who then stands as a personification of countless more like her. Almost all his columns on the subject are written like this. And his personalization is always much stronger than his case.</p> <p>At any rate, he does not have to prove that there is a sex trade and that there is advertising for sexual services. It would, however, be whistling into the wind to attempt to hold the web itself, and its global red light district, accountable. The Voice, with its abundant and quantifiable revenues and the lasting power of its alternative and, I suppose, suggestively amoral brand, is a more focused villain.</p> <p>Along with Craig's List, it has became a favorite anti-vice target. While, for nearly two generations, it has been hard to make much of a case against pervasive sexuality, the argument suddenly has new legs. It's not about promiscuity, which makes you sound square; it's not about prostitution, which makes you sound dirty; it's about sex-trafficking, which makes you sound like you're on the side of the angels, know-nothing though they might be.</p> <p>And then, there is Scientology. For some hard-to-fathom reason, the Voice's editor, Tony Ortega, has pursued an obsession with Scientology. In turn, the Scientologists, famous hasslers, have used their hassle machine to help demonize the Voice's sex ads. (<a href=\"http://jimromenesko.com/2012/09/14/tony-ortega-resigns-as-village-voice-editor/\">Ortega, who resigned recently</a>, may be a victim of Scientology and the Voice's efforts to save the sex ad business.)</p> <p>And then, there is too the significant point that the Voice and its sister alternative papers don't really exist anymore. Once, these were journalistic organizations with a particular moral and political view that made sex advertising a lot more defensible \u2013 and rallied a lot more defenders. But now, these heretofore alternative papers are adjuncts to a marketing organization (of movies, restaurants, clubs, acts, under-resourced brands), which, for legacy reasons, employes a few inexperienced and low-paid people who would like to be journalists, and who hope someone other than the Voice will eventually hire them to do that. Nobody, alas, really cares about the Village Voice anymore.</p> <p>I do not say this with any venom. The web has obviated any reason for there to be an alternative press. It is gone. But out of its ashes, the Voice's owners have been clever enough (or desperate enough) to create a different sort of enterprise \u2013 which, as it happens, is not all that interesting to anyone who doesn't want a prostitute. </p> <p>You see the problem here in defending itself. But there is, curiously, less of a problem if there is not a pretense of virtue, not a legacy to defend \u2013 or besmirch. \"We publish sex ads, like innumerable other places on the internet, so sue us\" is a better place to be now we are just pathetic, than it was when we used to be culturally important.</p> <p>Hence, the separation. On the one hand, the Voice's owners will continue to rake in the dough from the sex ad business over here, which, it being the web, really doesn't have anything to do with newspapers anyway. (The sex ad business may be called \"Backpage.com\", but there is nothing in front.) And then, over there, tongue comfortably in cheek, they'll \"sell\" \"control\" of the papers to some of their employees. Indeed, with what, one wonders, are the employees buying the papers, if not the owners' own money \u2013 get it?</p> <p>What the hell. In a world where everybody is playing loose with facts, inventing narratives, and pursuing self-interests, it seems like a reasonable solution.</p>",

  "<p>The stock market comeback of Vince Power, the self-styled king of gigs, ended in disaster on Monday as the ailing company behind the Benicassim and Hop Farm festivals threw in the towel and prepared to call in administrators.</p> <p>Industry experts blamed Music Festivals Group's financial woes on the wet summer and competition from rivals \u2013 even though Glastonbury and the Big Chill took gap years \u2013 and one-off events such as the Olympics.</p> <p>The Mean Fiddler impresario's return to public life was high-risk. Power owns 23% and, along with relatives, the family stake adds up to more than 40%. Like other investors, they face being left with nothing. Power had also propped up the company with a \u00a3750,000 unsecured loan in July.</p> <p>\"Over the last three or four years there has been a growing sense that the market has become too crowded,\" said Dave Newton, director at the box office website We Got Tickets. \"There is a bit of auto-correction going on.\"</p> <p>The number of festivals is estimated to have mushroomed to about 700 in the past decade and this year industry figures also complained of the pressure caused by a growing number of free music events such as Radio 1's Big Weekend in Hackney, which attracted 100,000 people.</p> <p>With the squeeze on consumer spending hitting all age groups, many Britons thought twice about what can add up to expensive weekends away. \"Prices have accelerated too much,\" said Newton. \"People are being asked to pay \u00a3100 for a ticket that five years ago would have cost \u00a335.\"</p> <p>Power has been described as the father of the commercial British festival, laying claim to hosting the first legal raves as well as turning around Reading and Glastonbury. But his Midas touch eluded him this time round with Music Festivals' life on the junior stock market proving shorter than that of a boy band assembled at the judges' houses stage of the X Factor competition. The shares debuted at 66.5p last June, valuing the company at just shy of \u00a310m, but were suspended on Friday at just 2.12p, making the company worth just \u00a3310,000.</p> <p>The feisty Irishman had vowed never to return to the public arena after a stormy relationship with the City during his time at the helm of Mean Fiddler, the music promoter he sold for \u00a338m in 2005.</p> <p>But he was lured back after losing nearly \u00a38m in 2010 when his music promotions and pubs business, Vince Power Music Group, went under.</p> <p>The apparently flourishing festival market presented the opportunity to rebuild his depleted fortune, he said, although the initial public offering, which raised \u00a36.5m from investors including Isis Equity Partners and Axa Framlington, took longer than expected as lacklustre ticket sales for blockbuster festivals such as Reading put off some potential backers.</p> <p>Bad vibes started to emerge from the company at the start of the summer when it told investors that ticket sales for Benicassim and Hop Farm looked disappointing.</p> <p>In the end, Hop Farm, held in Kent and headlined by Bob Dylan, proved to be loss-making, while Benicassim was hammered by the recession and punishing levels of youth unemployment in Spain. Despite offering acts such as the Stone Roses and Florence + the Machine, the Valencia festival would prove to be much less profitable than in 2011.</p> <p>By August the picture had darkened with the company saying it expected to make a \"material loss\" for the year and admitting it was casting around for a financial lifeline from investors. Last week it said that search had proved fruitless and moved for its shares to be suspended.</p> <p>\"The board has in recent weeks pursued a number of different funding proposals but the company has not been able to procure the necessary funding it requires,\" it said in a statement. Last year the company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3800,000 on sales of \u00a313m and at that time had no debt. With no formal appointment of administrators it remains unclear how much money is owed to its suppliers.</p> <p>Claire O'Neill, of the Association of Independent Festivals, said its 40 members, who include the organisers of Womad, have reported \"mixed experiences\" this year but the overall picture was not of doom and gloom, pointing to events such as Bestival and End of the Road, which sold out, albeit later than in previous years.</p> <p>\"There has been a huge increase in the number of festivals and for every new one that have popped up, others have fallen by the wayside,\" said O'Neill, adding that it was the festival brands with the most distinct identities that were prospering. \"Festivals can't be carbon copied and rolled out on a production line ... a successful festival needs a unique identity that people relate to and want to go and see.\"</p> <p>After selling Mean Fiddler, Power vowed never to return to the public arena, signing off with \"I was never a big plc fan\".

Even when they go down to 10 men, they don't change. The crowd got up and we didn't play well. We didn't keep the ball well enough.\"</p> <p>The Welshman's assessment crystallised the problem area that continues to puzzle United followers: central midfield. If retaining possession is an 11-man discipline the key contributors are those who move between defence and attack to set the side's rhythm and start and, ideally, help finish attacks.</p> <p>United lack a natural performer who is at ease in either penalty area and with the drive to carry him and the team forward. This \"hole\" can be traced back to Roy Keane's departure in 2005. Previously United's success had been based on a central pair who bossed opponents and team-mates around. Bryan Robson, Keane, Paul Ince, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes embodied Sir Alex Ferguson's belief that harnessing a pair of box-to-box midfielders was the path to control and trophies.</p> <p>In an interview with The Observer last year Scholes said: \"I always feel that, if you've got two in midfield and one goes forward, the other one stays; it's as simple as that. That's the way we played for a long time\" \u2013 but not in recent campaigns.</p> <p>In a squad packed with attackers \u2013 Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Shinji Kagawa \u2013 and the wingers, Nani, Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, United have seven midfielders of whom only one, Anderson, has the inclination and stamina to surge forward.</p> <p>Ferguson's full retinue in this department consists of Giggs, Scholes, Michael Carrick, Tom Cleverley, Anderson, Darren Fletcher (when fully fit) and Nick Powell. Of these the fine careers of Giggs and Scholes are turning to winter, Anderson is halfway through a decade at the club and is yet to impress consistently, Cleverley, at 23, is still only potential, Fletcher's long-term career is in doubt due to illness and Powell, 18, has eight minutes of senior United football on his CV.</p> <p>In the five Premier League games this season Scholes, Carrick, Cleverley, Giggs and Anderson have made the most appearances in what is usually the midfield two in Ferguson's 4-2-3-1.</p> <p>This quintet have managed only one goal (from Scholes), have yet to create any of the other 11 scored and only Carrick has completed the full 450 minutes of league action, which illustrates Ferguson's need to juggle his options here.</p> <p>Since Keane left seven years ago the manager can point to four league titles, one Fifa Club World Cup, three League Cups, one Champions League and two more final appearances.</p> <p>Last season's campaign was also just a late, final-day Sergio Ag\u00fcero goal away from a 20th championship and United currently lie in second place, only a point behind Chelsea. But a sense remains that the midfield gets ever more creaky. Giggs, Scholes and Carrick are in their thirties, with the former two 38 and 37 respectively. In that 2011 interview Scholes was speaking at the beginning of his retirement. There was no hint that he would return at the start of this year, welcomed back by Ferguson who assessed his options and decided Scholes's craft and experience were still required.</p> <p>Ferguson is not the keenest buyer of players in the new year transfer window. But a theory runs that, if United continue to struggle as they did at Liverpool, where the contest largely bypassed Giggs who started ahead of Cleverley and Anderson, then the manager may consider buying reinforcements in January.</p> <p>A roll-call of the central operators who might have joined United recently include Yaya Tour\u00e9, Luka Modric, Javi Martinez, Cheick Tiot\u00e9 and Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9.</p> <p>None did, with the situation vacant in the Ferguson midfield made more intriguing when comparisons are made with the rich resources enjoyed by other members of this year's expected top four.</p> <p>At Arsenal a recovering Jack Wilshere faces a fight with Santi Carzola, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby to become the side's pivot once again. Chelsea have flexibility in Oscar, Ramires, Oriol Romeu, Frank Lampard and Mikel John Obi, while Manchester City can turn to Tour\u00e9, Javi Garc\u00eda, James Milner, Gareth Barry, Jack Rodwell, Samir Nasri and David Silva, an engine room to take on any opposition.</p> <p>In the second game of the season Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 offered a perfect audition at Old Trafford when he dominated despite United beating Fulham 3-2. With six days left until the summer window closed the Belgian, 25, could have been bought by United for his \u00a315m release clause. Instead Tottenham Hotspur took him to north London.</p>",
  "<p>In a parking bay on a deserted industrial estate in Lyon, Karen, in her late 40s, sat in the passenger seat of her second-hand Ford Transit van wearing only black underwear. It was 7.30pm on a Friday night. She lit a pink lantern on the dashboard. Soon, a steady flow of cars was circling the car park \u2013 Mercedes, jeeps, old bangers \u2014 their drivers slowing to peer at the women in corsets sitting alone in a dozen parked, white vans, arms folded, candlelight flickering across their faces. \"Some men drive round for hours just staring,\" she said. \"Then they'll stop, ask the price, and demand a discount. I'll say, 'What, for all that petrol you've wasted?'\"</p> <p>A silver car slowed. \"20 euros for a blow job, 40 euros for 'love',\" she smiled. \"Too expensive,\" said the man, accelerating. A 60-year-old agreed to sex for 40 euros. Karen climbed into the back of the van, which she had decorated with a bed, a heater, purple curtains and a chest of drawers. Three minutes later the man walked out into the night. Karen laid out a clean sheet of paper-towel on the bed, spruced her blond hair. \"See, it's all very quick,\" she said. Most of the evening was spent sitting waiting. Then in 15 minutes, three clients paid for sex, including a Spanish man in his 20s in designer clothes. Each took less than five minutes. She had made her daily quota of cash needed to pay her bills.</p> <p>A former secretary from the southern naval city of Toulon, three times married, with two daughters, Karen first started selling sex in the 1980s: a brief stint on the street near a Lyon station, working mainly in clients' cars, \"which is very uncomfortable\". She quit and got married, but in 1992, divorced and with a young child she suddenly needed to \"put food on the table\". She returned to sex-work, first in a hostess bar, then meeting clients at her home via a newspaper small-ad. For seven years, she has worked on the street in her van, Monday to Saturday from 7pm to around 1am, paying tax as self-employed. \"'No pimp, no boss' is my motto. I'd rather do this than an office job, getting shouted at by a boss for a pittance.\" Her strict rules include condoms for everything and no kissing clients. \"You have to hit rock bottom to do this,\" she said. \"It's not an easy job, but it's a job where you can make money quickly. People try to say we're victims, say that we're alienated, that there's a sex attack in our childhood history, but I've never been raped by anyone. This is my free choice.\" She never looks into a client's eyes in the moment of a sexual exchange \u2013 \"I look anywhere but\" \u2013 and they rarely tell her their names. But in her top drawer beside the condom supplies is a petition signed by several of them: in neat writing, stating their profession: such as \"public works\" or \"driver\". It's a protest against the new French government's war on prostitution.</p> <p>Sex work was hardly a priority in the French election campaign, yet it has become one of the defining social issues of Francois Hollande's new Socialist government. In June, the women's minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, made the bold announcement that she wanted to \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jun/22/french-minister-abolition-prostitution-europe?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"abolish prostitution\">abolish prostitution</a>\" in France and Europe. \"My objective, like that of the Socialist party, is to see prostitution disappear,\" she said. The previous French parliament had already adopted a resolution aiming for a \"society without prostitution\". But can a government rid society of paid sex? The debate is raging among French intellectuals. Sex workers have taken to the streets, accusing the government of moralistic paternalism, saying Socialists are using the issue to distance themselves from the pariah <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dominique-strauss-kahn?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Dominique Strauss-Kahn\">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a>. DSK, once the Socialist hope for president, is under official investigation in France over complicity in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/26/dominique-strauss-kahn-charged-prostitution-ring\" title=\"pimping operation\">pimping operation</a> after sex workers were allegedly procured for his orgies. He said he didn't pay and didn't know the women were sex workers. \"I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman,\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17110618\" title=\"his lawyer told the press\">his lawyer told the press</a>. The inquiry has been extended to examine alleged group rape over the question of whether one sex worker was forced. Strauss-Kahn denies any violence.</p> <p>The \"white van women\" selling sex on Lyon's industrial estate in Gerland embody the French state's difficult attitudes to prostitution. As in the UK, prostitution itself \u2013 receiving money for sex, or paying for sex \u2013 is not a crime. But activities around it are. Laws prohibit pimping, human trafficking, buying sex from a minor and soliciting sex in public. Brothels were outlawed in 1946.</p> <p>Lyon, France's third biggest city, which has around 600 street prostitutes, has always been at the heart of sex worker protests. In 1975, more than 100 prostitutes occupied a church in the city complaining about police harassment, sparking similar protests across France until riot police evicted them. Now the Lyon Transit vans are the new frontline. In 2003, Nicolas Sarkozy, then interior minister, introduced a controversial law against soliciting, making it illegal to stand in a public place known for prostitution dressed in revealing clothes. To get round this, women started working in private vans. Selling sex inside a vehicle was not breaking the law. But police are now using any means to crack down on the growing number of sex-work vans, namely parking tickets and tow-trucks. In Lyon, sex workers complain of constant parking fines and being towed to the pound. Some on the industrial estate owe thousands of euros in parking tickets and pound-release fines accrued each month. \"You can get two parking tickets in 20 minutes, or be towed away on Tuesday, pay a fine, and be towed again on Thursday,\" said one. The women stand their ground. One drives 500km from Bordeaux each week, works and sleeps in her van for four days and nights, before going home. Others travel to the area from Burgundy or Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396601019\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348492305100/sex-workers-take-part-in--010.jpg\" alt=\"sex workers take part in an anti-abolition demonstration takes part in a demo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sex-workers in Lyon protest against the government's plans to penalise their clients. Photograph: Jean-Philippe Ksiazek/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Philippe Ksiazek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government is planning a major consultation on the abolition of prostitution. One idea under consideration is to criminalise the client, meaning anyone who buys sex from a sex worker would face prison and a fine. There are only a handful of European countries where clients of sex workers face prison. In 1999, Sweden became the first, followed by Norway and Iceland. But it is far from certain that France will put it on the statute books. The French Socialists would like their abolitionist stance to be mirrored in Europe, namely in the country they see as closest in its attitude to prostitution: the UK. Other neighbours have radically different approaches: in Germany, prostitution is legal and municipally regulated; in Spain, vast borderland brothels in places such as La&#xa0;Jonquera in Catalonia are frequented by French clients.</p> <p>In a cafe near Place de Clichy, in northern Paris, Elizabeth, 49, and seven Algerian transgender sex workers were having coffee before going to work on the streets in the west of Paris. Elizabeth, originally from Cali in Colombia, had arrived in her blue Citro\u00ebn people carrier, which with a mattress in the boot doubled as her workspace in Paris's Bois de Boulogne park, where she sells sex from 11am to 6pm each weekday, for \u00a440. The Bois de Boulogne, a favourite daytime jogging spot of Sarkozy's, is a centre of the crackdown on prostitutes' vans. Elizabeth has had more than 60 parking tickets this year. \"I'm considering a hunger strike against the idea of criminalising clients,\" she said. \"If clients risk prison, sex work will be forced underground and into apartments, pimps will benefit, sex workers' security will be compromised. Already the mere talk of clients being criminalised means there are less customers on the street.\"</p> <p>For Elizabeth, transsexual sex work is a reflection of daily discrimination. \"As a transsexual, you can't find work, no one will rent you an apartment, it's a difficult existence. Often this seems the only option,\" she said. Two months ago, Jasmine, 30, started working on a road in the Bois de Boulogne after leaving Algiers. \"I can't go back to Algeria because of the way I look. My parents think I'm waiting tables here. I just want a normal life as a transsexual, to run a shop or a hairdressers. But I have to pay \u00a440 a night to live in a dire hotel room with no toilet. This is the only way I can get the money. I work a few hours a night, 11pm until 2am. I try to choose men in their 40s, who I think are safe. I'm really scared on the street, but I'm most scared of the police.\"</p> <p>The government estimates there are 20,000 prostitutes in France, with between 5,000 and 8,000 in Paris. <a href=\"http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/rap-info/i3334.asp#P1540_313484\" title=\"A parliamentary report last year\">A parliamentary report last year</a> by a rightwing and a Socialist MP who proposed criminalising clients said 90% of street prostitutes were foreign and 80% of sex workers in France were victims of sex trafficking. Where 20 years ago the majority of street prostitutes were French, most are now foreign and criminal networks are increasing, most recently involving Nigerian women or Romanians trafficking Albanians or Moldovans.</p> <p>In July, six Romanians appeared in court outside Paris charged with pimping: accused of beating women, confiscating their passports and forcing them to work as prostitutes. Last November a similar Romanian network was dismantled, including minors made to work in the Bois de Boulogne. The paper Le Progr\u00e8s reported that this summer in Lyon police discovered a Chinese woman in her 30s shut in an apartment she hadn't left for three weeks, forced to sell sex according to a \"menu\" of services translated into Chinese. Clients had replied to a small ad for \"massages\". But far from trusting the police to protect sex workers, the atmosphere is one of fear and hostility. Some sex workers complain of being insulted and assaulted: in Colmar in 2010, two police officers and a train-worker for the SNCF national rail were convicted of raping a Romanian sex worker. Other allegations of rape are going through the courts.</p> <p>Meanwhile the state is under pressure to do more against trafficking and sexual slavery. Rights groups say not enough support and protection has been given to trafficked women who cooperate to denounce their abusers.</p> <p>\"Instead of grandstanding about abolishing all prostitution, why don't they immediately end the prostitution of minors and human trafficking? They've already got all the laws to stop that, yet it still exists,\" said a male sex worker in his 20s, who works nights in the forest of Fontainebleau outside Paris.</p> <p>There is fierce debate in France over whether all sex workers should be considered victims, or whether \"independents\", without pimps and beginning to be unionised, should be viewed as separate. Pro-abolition feminists say the act of paying for sex is always an act of violence, forcing the sex worker to anaesthetise themselves and cut themselves off from their own body to endure it. \"Slavery hasn't been eradicated, but it has been abolished. The same choice for prostitution would be an advance for civilisation,\" said the feminist Sylviane Agacinski. Another high-profile feminist, Elisabeth Badinter, co-wrote a counter-argument saying talk of abolishing prostitution was based on \"two debatable assumptions: that charging for sex is an affront to women's dignity and that all prostitutes are victims of their bastard clients\". She said a woman selling sex was \"not necessarily a victim of male oppression\". And not all clients were \"horrible predators or sexual obsessives who treat the woman as disposable objects\".</p> <p>Clo\u00e9 Navarro, 27, spokeswoman for the Strass, the French sex workers' union, studied as a nurse and now sells sex on the street in the west of Paris to pay for her postgraduate studies for work with autistic children. She says she feels safer on the street, working in clients' cars or hotels, rather than on the internet, where she can't see the man before accepting an encounter. \"This is not a job everyone can do, but it's a real job. You need a lot of empathy. People come to us with problems. Sometimes I think I've got the word 'nurse' stamped on my forehead,\" she said. She described clients as \"everyone\", from 20s to 70s, widowers, men with disabilities, \"a high percentage\" of new fathers with babies and toddlers. \"This government is stigmatising sex workers. I work one street away from a police station. The abolitionist approach would push sex work into a no-man's land where we are more likely be attacked,\" she said.</p> <p>The new face of the union is its leader, Morgane Merteuil, 25, a postgraduate literature student. She started sex work as a student in a hostess bar in Grenoble, but now works exclusively on the internet as a self-employed escort. A one-time anarchist activist and rebel from a conservative provincial family, she has just published what she calls a feminist sex workers' manifesto. She balks at \"media cliches\" that sex work divides between low-class work on the street or high-class five-star luxury: \"I don't think I've ever met a client in anything more than a cheap hotel costing \u00a460 a night,\" she said. She rails at the new leftwing government for \"morality politics\" and \"paternalism\", describes sex-work as a job \u2013 \"a necessity, like any other job\" and demands the immediate scrapping of the law against soliciting.</p> <p>In Lyon, Karen was preparing to lock up her van and go home to her boyfriend. \"It's not possible to abolish prostitution,\" she said. \"Look at the death penalty, did that stop murder?\"</p>",

  "<p>Dr Maggie Atkinson might have started out as an English and drama teacher, but she's now clearly a politician, and one who fights strategically for the children she represents as children's commissioner for England.</p> <p>Her current message is that schools need to act earlier and in a more concerted way to pick up on signs that children are being neglected or abused. While praising primary teachers for the \"very finely tuned radar\" many have developed, Atkinson now says that even more needs to be done by teachers, simply because they are in the front line and there is often no one else. And as welfare and council cuts take hold, children's vulnerability is likely to increase.</p> <p>Today sees the publication of research specifically commissioned by her office as a result of her concern about rising child poverty levels. The research was carried out by the NSPCC and Youthworks with co-operation from schools that have \"outstanding\" safeguarding procedures. It looks at best practice on child protection in primary schools. The report, You Have Someone to Trust, is accompanied by a handbook called Practical Tips for Schools. Recommendations for schools include making sure staff are easily available to parents who want to talk, regular monitoring of recorded concerns, and designating time for training on safeguarding.</p> <p>Teachers must be the first responders, spotting and handling the signs that pupils might be in trouble, says Atkinson. It is not always wilful neglect or abuse they need to be looking out for, but signs that poverty is overwhelming families so that some parents are no longer coping. \"Primary school is a very consistent experience in the life of a child. School is a haven, a place of solace and a place where there are adults to whom you can talk,\" she says.</p> <p>Many heads argue that social services are already raising thresholds for their intervention ever higher when there is concern about a child and that they have to argue very forcefully for intervention when it is obvious a family is not coping. But Atkinson argues that they don't always need to call on a social worker. \"Social workers are very specialist, very high-end members of staff in a local authority or any other agency,\" she says.</p> <p>\"What you actually need is to respond to the child at a far earlier stage.\" Schools will need to get better at building a picture of their concerns about a child using, for example, \"cause for concern\" forms on which any member of staff can enter a worry about a child, no matter how small.</p> <p>Though some schools, even in areas of high deprivation with all the other demands on teachers that implies, do demonstrate fantastic practice on safeguarding and early intervention, Atkinson believes there can be no excuses \u2013 every school should be outstanding when it comes to protecting their pupils.</p> <p>\"What's the first issue that you notice? Are their shoes not clean, is their uniform dirty, do they look exhausted? Have they always done their homework? Are they suddenly aggressive with their playmates when they never have been before? That's not social work. That's really good children's services work. Before you hit the need for social workers.\"</p> <p>She knows that some headteachers have employed their own dedicated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/05/teachers-ill-equipped-increase-child-neglect\" title=\"\">family liaison workers</a> to put early intervention measures in place. Deciding to do this may mean sacrificing some enrichment activities such as residential trips, which offer children \"the fullest and richest and most rounded things that you would want because affording it is now an issue\". But she says spending school budget in this way \"is justified if what you're trying to do is be an inclusive community that also educates its children.\"</p> <p>No matter how much teachers want to care for pupils, the message that they must take on more responsibility may not be universally welcomed in a profession that is already stressed and stretched. Atkinson knows this. \"I am aware that there are members of the profession who consider that they are being asked to be everything for everybody.</p> <p>\"What I'm saying is that schooling has never been just about what happens in the classroom. Schooling is about how they are when they get on the bus, how they are when they walk through your gate and if you're not prepared to understand that the child does not put down their worries at the door, then there is an issue about how you approach their readiness to learn.\"</p> <p>Research from a range of charities and thinktanks continues to build a picture of welfare cuts disproportionately affecting women and children. \"The people who can do least about a changing welfare regime, which may well mean that parents have smaller amounts of money coming into their pockets, are actually not the adults, they're the children.\" All four UK children's commissioners <a href=\"http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/content/press_release/content_461\" title=\"\">publicly opposed</a> the welfare reform bill, and the \u00a326,000 benefit cap to be imposed on families was the focus of Atkinson's concern. The knock-on effects will have serious effects on children's ability to learn, she believes.</p> <p>\"How do you safeguard the absolute best of the ambitions that we have for our children when the research is starting to say communities are massively challenged by falling rates of employment, and rising rates of not making ends meet?\" she asks. \"I would say this to any government: there is a need for all of us to be humble enough to spot the signs and be prepared to do something different if what we thought was going to work, doesn't.\"</p> <p>Whether she'll be the person giving that message when <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a00211567/reform-of-the-office-of-children%27s-commissioner\" title=\"\">the role of children's commissioner</a> is beefed up next year isn't yet known. An independent report by the former headteachers' leader John Dunford, published in July, concluded that the current remit was too limited and that its overall impact since the job was created in 2004 had been disappointing. Draft legislation has been introduced accepting Dunford's recommendations that the role should focus on \"promoting and protecting the rights of children\" rather than their views and interests.</p> <p>Whether or not Atkinson will be a candidate for the revamped job, she believes there are even more troubling times ahead. \"I think quite a lot of the public believes that the various spending decisions that have had to be made and the various cuts that have followed are over.\"</p> <p>Knowing the hardships children are suffering, does she ever get angry? There's a pause. \"It's a huge waste of energy getting angry. What this report does is say: what do we know about the issue, who can find out some more, where's the voice of the child? And then it says: 'What are we going to do about this?' Because this is not just me having a go: when you get angry, what you end up being is the person who does all the shouting and bawling. There is very little point in just shouting and bawling because people go 'she's at it again'.</p> <p>\"If you've got evidence, plus research, plus lived experience, plus the voice of the child telling you what life is like for them, and then you present it, and you say 'this is inescapable, we have to do something about this', it's very difficult for those who can do something to say: 'well, we're not going to'.\"</p> <p>This time, she is not talking about teachers.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012 to clarify that Youthworks and the NSPCC worked on the report.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, Mitt Romney and President Obama traded insults in a most amazing way, reminding us that success in American politics these days requires two things: saying the most absurd things with a straight face, and maximizing the appearance of differences with your opponent, while minimizing their reality. Consider \u2026</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I've learned some lessons. Most important is you can't change Washington from inside, only from the outside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"He said he can't change Washington from inside. He can only change it from outside. I can change Washington. I will change Washington. We'll get the job done from the inside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"What kind of inside job is he talking about? Is it the job of rubber-stamping the top-down, you're-on-your-own agenda of this Republican Congress? Because if it is, we don't want it \u2026 We don't want an inside job in Washington.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, Romney's a pretty obvious case of Mr Insider. But let's look at Obama. He doesn't want an inside job? Over the last four years, Obama has appointed nothing but insiders \u2013 many of whom had actively contributed to the financial crisis and profited from it \u2013 to his administration's senior regulatory, law enforcement, and economic policy jobs. The head of the SEC, Mary Shapiro, was fresh from running the investment banking industry's \"self-regulator\", Finra, which gave her a $9m severance bonus to soften the pain of a low government salary. Her director of enforcement, Robert Khuzami, had been general counsel for the Americas of Deutsche Bank during the bubble.</p> <p>The head of the justice department criminal division, Lanny Breuer, had been in charge of the white-collar criminal defense practice of Covington &amp; Burling, a law firm that represents and lobbies for nearly every major bank. The head of the office of management and budget, Jacob Lew, made millions as the chief financial officer of Citigroup Alternative Investments, even as that group lost billions for Citigroup. As head of the National Economic Council, we got Larry Summers, who as Clinton's treasury secretary pushed through the repeal of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act\">Glass-Steagall</a> and a law banning regulation of OTC derivatives, and who then proceeded to make $7m from financial services firms in the year prior to joining the Obama administration (including $135,000 for a single speech to Goldman Sachs). Other senior jobs went to Goldman Sachs lobbyists, investment bankers, private equity executives, and the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/obama-administration-hires-lobbyist-it-attacked-in-2008/\">former chief lobbyist of Fannie Mae</a>.</p> <p>And beyond Obama's personnel, there were his policies. He did nothing about the obscene $14bn in bonuses awarded in early 2009 by banks that would literally have been bankrupt without federal bailouts; he failed to prosecute even a single bank or financial executive despite clear evidence of rampant, systemic fraud; and he has since attempted only the most pitiful of systemic reforms.</p> <p>Nor is this pattern restricted to the financial sector: despite the worst oil spill in history, one that killed 11 people, and a lethal mine disaster that followed deception of safety inspectors, there have been no prosecutions of energy executives, either. And it all shows: in this campaign, Obama has actually raised more money than Mitt Romney, the poster boy of plutocracy.</p> <p>Well, I'll be the first to admit that I have a personal axe to grind. Like, how do I know all this stuff? Well, two years ago, I made a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089/\">documentary film about the financial crisis</a>, followed recently by a book. The film, based on a year of research and nearly 100 on-camera interviews, chronicled the thoroughly bipartisan process of deregulation, political corruption, and lack of law enforcement that paved the way for the financial crisis. It concludes with a detailed examination of the Obama administration's abysmal record.</p> <p>The film won the Academy Award for best documentary in 2011; in my Oscar acceptance speech, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpz5DVwnbnk\">I called out the lack of criminal prosecutions</a>, to audience applause. The title of this film? I never thought you'd ask.</p> <p>Inside Job.</p> <p>So there you have it \u2013 my real gripe is that Obama stole my title for his petty spat with Romney, each of them pretending to be the guy who would fix Washington corruption \u2013 when, of course, neither of them would.</p> <p>I should say for the record that despite the foregoing, I support President Obama's re-election. For all Obama's faults, Romney and the new Republican party would be even worse. Obama has at least tried to do a <em>few</em> things, some of the time, however timid. Not to mention little details like gay marriage, abortion, climate change, tax returns, et cetera.</p> <p>But the sad truth is that the more the two candidates pretend to be at each other's throats, the more similar they are in reality, at least where money is concerned. They would both let America's new financial oligarchy run amok, at the nation's great expense. This is just one domain among many in which both candidates avoid the truth, preferring to trade blows in the theater of the absurd.</p>",
  "<p>A 15-year-old schoolgirl and her married teacher, who are believed to be together in France, had booked a return ferry ticket but did not use it, police say.</p> <p>Megan Stammers, from Eastbourne, and Jeremy Forrest, 30, left on Thursday night from Dover for Calais, and had booked to return by the same route on Sunday. Police have disclosed that a message was sent to a friend of the runaway teenager saying she had arrived in France, and though it was not from Megan's phone, it was believed the message was from her.</p> <p>As Megan's parents made appeals for her to get in touch, Chief Inspector Jason Tingley, leading the investigation, made a direct appeal to Forrest. \"My message to Mr Forrest is this may not have gone as you expected it would. Right now, our priority is to know that Megan is safe, and I would ask you to do the right thing and make contact with us.\"</p> <p>Appealing to Megan, he said: \"We believe that you left of your own accord with Jeremy. But we need to hear that you're OK. You are not, and I stress, you are not in trouble.\"</p> <p>Megan, a pupil at Bishop Bell CofE school where Forrest, who married last year, teaches maths, was reported missing on Friday. She had told her mother she was staying with a friend on Thursday night. It also emerged that she had been receiving after-school extra-curricular tuition in maths.</p> <p>Her mother, Danielle Wilson, implored: \"Sweetheart, I don't care what you've done or why. I just want you home.\"</p> <p>Her stepfather, Martin Stammers, also a teacher, who is estranged from her mother, said the last contact he and Megan had was an agreement by text to meet for lunch last Saturday. \"We had a date on Saturday and we didn't make it. Babes, the offer's still there, sweetheart,\" he said. \"I just want you to come home safe and well.\" It was \"so out of character for her\", he added.</p> <p>Police believe the pair are travelling in Forrest's black Ford Fiesta, registration GJ08 RJO, and may still be in France. They are working with French authorities, the UK Border Agency and the British embassy in France.</p> <p>Tingley said: \"Our inquiries have shown that they left the UK after 9.30pm on Thursday 20 September, after boarding a ferry in Jeremy's black Ford Fiesta. They were expected to return yesterday [Sunday], during the late evening. The scheduled ferry and the passenger list were checked but they were not on either.\"</p> <p>Forrest, from Ringmer, near Lewes, a musician who plays with a band and uses the stage name Jeremy Ayre, is a regular blogger and tweeter. He had apparently written on his blog, under his stage name, about a \"moral dilemma\" in a posting four months ago headed: \"You hit me just like heroin \u2026\" Posted online on 19 May, it states: \"The last two weeks have been pretty intense, in both a good and a bad way!!! I'll touch on the bad, although it will have to be a bit vague to be public-ally digestible, but have lots of positive music related s*** to shoot \u2026 About a week ago I had a bit of a moral dilemma to deal with, both internally and externally. And the overriding question it left me with was this: How do we, and how should we, define what is right or wrong, acceptable or unacceptable???</p> <p>\"I came to a few different conclusions, mainly that actually we get a lot of things wrong, but at the end of the day I was satisfied that if you can look at yourself in the mirror and know that, under all the front, that you are a good person, that should have faith in your own judgment. That's some philosophical gold for you there!!!\"</p> <p>Megan was described by her mother as \"a typical girl\". She said her daughter was intelligent but could also be \"very childlike\". She had been like an \"excitable puppy, jumping around\" and telling her mother she loved her before she left.</p> <p>Appeals for help in tracing her continued to be posted on Twitter and Facebook, including by her sister Brooke who tweeted: \"Keeping hope that we'll have good news soon. Need our meg home safe and sound #keepfaith #findmeganstammers.\"</p> <p>A statement on the website of Bishop Bell school said: \"We are extremely concerned about a missing pupil and, if anyone at all has any information, we would urge them to contact the police.\"</p> <p>Officials at East Sussex county council said they were investigating the background of the case \"as a matter of urgency\". \"Obviously this is a serious situation and one which we and the school are extremely concerned about. As a matter of urgency we are investigating exactly what has happened and will decide what action needs to be taken,\" they said.</p> <p>Anyone with information is asked to call Sussex police on 101.</p>",
  "<p>\"I believe the pendulum has swung the other way,\" Tyler Hamilton says on a quiet afternoon at home in Montana as he considers the shift of momentum in the case of Lance Armstrong and the dirty truth of road cycling. \"The Omert\u00e0&#xa0;\u2013 the code of silence \u2013 still exists but a lot of riders in the peloton, a lot of directors, know so much about Lance. They've not said a lot because they're scared. But the truth is coming out now. I've heard that the stuff coming out in the next couple of weeks from other riders is going to make front page news in the sports sections.\"</p> <p>Hamilton pauses in the midst of a continuing storm. The recent publication of his book The Secret Race marked a gripping and grimy return to his past as an elite cyclist and former team-mate of Armstrong. In a story swollen with blood bags and discarded needles, with furtively constant use of EPO, Hamilton has placed Armstrong near the centre of his narrative.</p> <p>A mordant humour sometimes frames the shooting up and downbeat cheating. In his team they named EPO after Edgar Allan Poe, a novelist of mystery whose final words on his deathbed were reputedly: \"Lord, help my poor soul.\" If they usually called their performance-enhancing drug of choice \"Edgar\", being on first-name terms with EPO, Hamilton claims to have also asked Armstrong a simple question about \"Poe\". They were in Armstrong's villa in Nice, in the spring of 1999, preparing for the Tour de France \u2013 and the first of his seven wins.</p> <p>\"Hey dude, you got any Poe I can borrow?\" Hamilton supposedly asked Armstrong. \"Lance pointed casually to the fridge,\" Hamilton writes. \"I opened it and there, on the door, next to a carton of milk was a carton of EPO, each stoppered vial standing upright, little soldiers in their cardboard cells. I was surprised that Lance would be so cavalier.\" Unlike Hamilton and other paranoid members of the peloton, \"Lance acted like he was invulnerable.\"</p> <p>The fa\u00e7ade has crumbled \u2013 and last month Armstrong abandoned any further challenge to the US Anti-doping Agency's allegations that he had taken performance-enhancing drugs between 1999 and 2005. A day later Usada gave itself the right to strip Armstrong of all his Tour victories. They will soon send a report to the Union Cycliste Internationale, containing riders's testimonies, which is both critical of cycling's governing body and a justification of their action against Armstrong. Travis Tygart, the director of Usada, has received three death threats since beginning his investigation \u2013 with the French newspaper L'Equipe suggesting this week that the evidence against Armstrong will be \"terrible\" and \"30 times\" more damning than anything published so far.</p> <p>\"I was initially surprised,\" Hamilton claims of Armstrong's decision, \"because Lance never backs down from a fight. It's the first time we've seen that happen. But then I wasn't surprised because the information is so comprehensive it would have been a long, slow death for him. The public would have found out eventually so I think he decided to quit while he was ahead.\"</p> <p>Hamilton believes the dam of deceit is about to burst and he stresses that Tygart \"deserves a good medal. Hopefully all the testimonies coming out in the next few weeks will encourage others currently in cycling to speak out. If a director or <em>soigneur</em> wants to tell the truth I'm not sure they should be penalised. They should allow a period of time when they can be transparent without worrying about their futures.\"</p> <p>Hamilton's suggested amnesty echoes the call made by Jonathan Vaughters for cycling to emulate South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission after apartheid. Vaughters, an anti-doping campaigner who now manages the Garmin-Sharp team, used to be a team-mate of Armstrong and Hamilton at US Postal. He has also admitted his doping past.</p> <p>\"You can say I'm lying,\" Hamilton murmurs, \"but you can't say all 10 of us are lying. So Lance is in a tough spot right now. If I could make a recommendation to him it would be to tell the truth. I've been through this. I lied for years and years. And the thing about lies and secrets is that they eat you alive from the inside. I would not wish that pain on anyone.\"</p> <p>Hamilton's deception finally ended after 13 years when, in June 2010, he was contacted by Jeff Novitsky, a federal investigator. Hamilton could have refused to admit his doping but, instead, he spoke for four hours before a grand jury as he explained all he had done, and seen, in professional cycling. Novitsky then allowed him to speak for another three hours. Hamilton compares himself to a fist unclenching as the truth flowed out of his mouth.</p> <p>\"I feel that a hundred times more now,\" he says. \"It's a massive release but I also feel obliged to admit that I did dope. No-one put a gun to my head. I knew the difference between right and wrong. But I'd like people to understand how we started small and got trapped. I was just a couple of months away from riding in my first Tour de France. I was in a vulnerable position and they put a subtle pressure on me to make a poor decision.\"</p> <p>Hamilton was invited to join \"the white bag club\" in 1997 and he suggests that most cyclists have \"a thousand days\" before their youthful idealism subsides and it just seems easier to dope. Three years of riding huge and terrible mountains <em>paniagua</em> [Spanish for \"on bread and water\"], according to Hamilton, produces a thousand days of crushed hope as doped cyclists sail past with apparently little effort.</p> <p>Yet pages in Hamilton's book still jar. In 2003 a long solo breakaway resulted in Hamilton winning a stage to Bayonne in the Tour de France and he writes this disconcerting passage: \"You can call me a cheater and doper until the cows come home. But the fact remains that in a race where everybody had equal opportunity I played the game and I played it well.\"</p> <p>This kind of smug zeal is fuelled by a bogus claim that, even at its worst, cycling offered a \"level playing field.\" It peddles the hollow deceit that underpins the entire twisted culture of doping. If it's surprising that Hamilton should have used it again, he backtracks now. \"That's how we looked at it then but to be honest with you it really wasn't a level playing field. If you weren't a risk-taker you were always going to be a step behind. You could be the best cyclist in the world but if you weren't a risk-taker you weren't going to win the Tour de France. It takes money and connections to doctors.\"</p> <p>False boldness bolsters the doping \"risk-taker\". Instead, the boldest and bravest man in Hamilton's book makes just a fleeting appearance. Christophe Bassons was called Mr Clean. He not only refused to dope but during the 1999 Tour he wrote a column for Le Parisien in which he said the notorious Festina Affair had changed nothing. Despite arrests and bans, cycling remained as crooked as ever. Hamilton claims he saw Armstrong threaten and then isolate Bassons.</p> <p>\"No one defended him,\" Hamilton writes of Bassons. \"No one would talk to him, not even on his own team. Bassons understood and dropped out the following day.\" Asked about Bassons now, Hamilton sounds mortified. \"I feel awful about the way he was treated. I always knew the peloton would not talk to Christophe after Lance singled him out \u2013 but shame on me for doing the same. We succumbed to the pressure that Lance exerted.</p> <p>\"Around 2004, when I was racing against the big beasts, there were only two riders who spoke out against doping: Christophe and Filippo Simeoni, the Italian rider. They were both quickly knocked to the floor and shut down by Lance. Their careers just went downhill and they were ushered out of the sport. At the time people were happy to see them leave. Now I think: 'How tragic.' I'd love to let them know how I feel. They were just two small fish in a huge pond filled with hundreds of fishermen \u2013 they had little chance.\"</p> <p>One of Hamilton's most serious allegations in his book is that the UCI not only did so little to combat doping but that he was summoned to their headquarters and given a quiet warning about his blood-test results after he out-climbed Armstrong on Mont Ventoux during the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 classic in 2004. Floyd Landis, who has since also admitted to doping, apparently told Hamilton that \"Lance called the UCI on you \u2026 and said \u2026 you were on some new shit.\" Hamilton confronted Armstrong \u2013 who denied the allegation.</p> <p>The UCI, meanwhile, has come in for a deluge of criticism in the media since announcing last week that it would sue Paul Kimmage, the renowned anti-doping writer, in relation to the publication of the transcript of a 2011 interview with Landis. \"It's mind-boggling,\" Hamilton says. \"I just hope journalists keep asking the tough questions and we stick up for Paul Kimmage and others fighting for a clean sport.</p> <p>\"I've never got my head fully around the UCI and I've never been comfortable with it. There is absolutely no doubt that the UCI could do much, much more. Obviously the sport has changed and testing has got much better but we're trying to figure out what happened in the past. We need to answer those questions before the sport can move on. It's cleaner but it still has bad elements. There are people running teams and cyclists who are not still fully transparent.\"</p> <p>If Hamilton believes that the victory of Bradley Wiggins and Team Sky in this year's Tour is a triumph for clean riding, he remains \"sceptical about cycling at the elite level. There's still a lot of denial. Times have slowed down a lot from 10 years ago and testing is getting a lot better. But it still feels as if there's not much transparency. That worries me.\"</p> <p>Hamilton argues that the full story of Armstrong would bestow freedom on everyone. \"I'd like to say to him, 'Lance, you are going to be way happier if you can take this heavy weight off your back.' But, right now, Lance is afraid. He's afraid to let down his family, his friends and the cancer community. It's a tough pill to swallow but people will forgive him. And even if Lance lost half his income he's still going to be fine.</p> <p>Hamilton hesitates when asked if Armstrong will buckle under the weight of new information. \"I don't know. Based on his recent actions he'll deny it. But I can't imagine he can maintain it. He's one hell of a tough son of a bitch but I can speak from experience that telling the truth feels so good. It's totally changed my life. I didn't have much to look forward to before I told the truth. I still wish I'd made the right choice but I'm really excited about moving forward with the second part of my life. I couldn't have said that two years ago. It's the same with Lance. His future is going to be so much greater if he tells the truth.\"</p> <p><em>The Secret Race by Tyler Hamilton &amp; Daniel Coyle [Bantam, \u00a315.19] is available from guardianbookshop.co.uk</em></p>",

He has said he would like to be Lib Dem leader himself, and that episode seemed to show that there was little communication between himself and Clegg's team, and perhaps little love lost. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506092fc58f9bdd2eeba01a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T17:06:04.316Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hi this, is <strong>Paul Owen</strong> taking over for the evening.</p> <p>I have just been to see David Laws, the totemic Lib Dem right-winger who resigned as chief secretary to the Treasury over his expenses almost as soon as he'd got the job and has just been brought back in from the cold as junior education minister, replacing Sarah Teather.</p> <p>Poor Teather is all over the conference fringe programme, which was printed before the reshuffle - but in the case of this \"ministerial surgery\" at any rate her place has been taken by Laws. \"Sarah Teather must enjoy having a freer diary,\" suggested the moderator optimistically. Hmm.</p> <p>Laws is going to be quite powerful in the Liberal Democrats in the months and years ahead. Teather was responsible for early years and childcare, whereas Laws covers schools, but that's really just the start of his domain. He also has a \"roving brief\" looking out for Lib Dem interests across the whole department, and in addition is shadowing Tory policy minister Oliver Letwin, which means he is in charge of monitoring every aspect of coalition policy for the Lib Dems - except, he stresses, those that fall to Danny Alexander: the economy, energy and defence.</p> <p>But if he is powerful within the party, he seems less so within his department. Laws was asked a lot about the new ebacc, the qualification replacing GCSEs. He said Lib Dems had altered the policy beyond recognition compared to what it looked like when education secretary Michael Gove first floated it: \"I wouldn't say we tweaked the proposals. Compared to what was [originally] announced in the Daily Mail, this was a completely different set of proposals,\" he said.</p> <p>Lib Dems had also argued that more subjects than just English, maths and science needed to be brought under the ebacc umbrella: \"We don't want a second tier of qualifications which are important but which will be seen to left behind in a discredited brand.\" He would continue to argue for this, he said. \"I suspect the secretary of state doesn't see this as the final word on it.\" But it seemed that it would be Gove rather than Laws having that final word.</p> <p>Similarly, Laws said that despite the huge growth in academy schools, which exist outside local authority control and now make up more than half of all secondaries, there would always be a role for local authorities - but this seemed to be more his prediction than an announcement of the government's position. \"I don't think you can sensibly design an education system for the future for 23,500 schools that relies either on all the schools acting autonomously or some minister taking responsibility for 23,500 schools,\" he said. It was \"not practical\" for a minister to take responsibility for issues such as planning, transport and allocating capital at that local level.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he was \"far from starry-eyed about the role of local authorities in education in the past\", and it was down to Lib Dems to make the case for their new role with that in mind, Laws said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>David Laws at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/SyDdPFWr\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T16:41:57+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50609156c0e327c3f7c90521\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T16:59:06.248Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Alan Travis</strong> has sent me this from a fringe meeting.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord McNally, the last remaining member of Ken Clarke's ministry of justice team, was at a fringe meeting reflecting on Clarke's fate. \"The only benefit of Ken's departure is that the Liberal Democrats will stop giving all the credit to Ken Clarke for any liberal measure the Ministry of Justice takes and may start to give me some credit as well,\" he said.</p> <p>McNally said, somewhat unhappily, that the future in prisons and probation was more market testing, more outsourcing and more payment by results.

Delegates then passed the motion, which criticised Conservatives for refusing to acknowledge that investing in carbon-reducing technologies could make an important contribution to growth.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Jeremy Browne, the Home Office minister, has said that the Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell should explain what he actually said to the police.</strong> While other Liberal Democrats have said little about the Mitchell affair because the party does not want it to distract attention from its conference, Browne said Mitchell's morning apology did not go far enough.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think people want to know what was said. Explaining to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what was said.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have voted for a motion saying the speed limit in urban areas should be cut to 20mph. </strong>Under the plan, all new roads would have a 20mph limit and the government would encourage councils to switch from 30mph to 20mph on existing roads.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have backed a motion urging the government to increase the science budget by 3% above inflation for the next 15 years.</strong> Julian Huppert, the MP who moved the motion, said: \"Britain has a proud history of leading the world in science - innovations from British researchers have changed our planet and our way of life. But we are in danger of losing our reputation as a world leader in research and development. We are in danger of limiting our access to vital technological developments and the benefits they bring.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have committed themselves to campaign for measures to promote John Lewis-style mutual businesses.</strong> As the Press Association reports, they backed proposals which would give workers in publicly listed firms with more than 250 employees the right to request an employee share scheme. The policy would also give greater opportunities for workers to buy out a firm if its owners put it up for sale or to pick up shares at a discount if their firm goes public.</p> <p>That's all from me for today.

This is yet another government policy thrown into uncertainty by bickering in government before it has even got off the ground.</p> <p>A major problem with the government\u2019s previous failed schemes to get lending going to businesses, including Project Merlin and credit easing, was that they relied on the banks themselves getting money out of the door, without any real safeguards to ensure this happened. It is far from clear that Vince Cable\u2019s business bank will be immune from these shortcomings.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Vince Cable concentrated on the key issue of the moment - growth. It is always tempting for politicians to play to their conference gallery, and I am pleased that Vince's speech went to the heart of the growth debate.</p> <p>A new-style boutique, government-backed bank for growth firms can bring something new to the business lending toolkit. The big gripe today from many growth businesses is a gap in the market for long-term investment finance. The new \u00a31bn wholesale fund will enable banks to provide \u201cpatient capital\u201d to high growth businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Longworth</strong>, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The business bank announced by Vince Cable could be one of the lasting legacies of this government, and a key pillar of UK competitiveness in the years to come. While a \u00a31bn commitment is an important first step, Whitehall must ensure that the business bank gets off the ground with an independent mandate and a mission to support growing companies.</p> <p>Six in 10 chamber members told us just last week that they would feel more confident in securing finance if Britain had a government-backed business bank. Commercial banks should have a first right of refusal, but, as we have argued before, the business bank will eventually need the infrastructure to make its own decisions on loans, and its own channels to deliver funds to growing businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T14:46:18.888Z\">at 3.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5060674158f9bdd2eeba018a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:59:30.152Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Guardian video from the Cable speech.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"Vince Cable unveils \u00a31bn backing for business bank - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506062ae58f9bdd2eeba0187\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:39:58.529Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-237eb050-fe8e-481d-b571-25f2b153181c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348493964288/d5052b6a-50eb-4789-a5eb-6d435c7c9591-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson, Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg, Lorely Burt, and Vince Cable vote on a policy motion.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Swinson, Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg, Lorely Burt and Vince Cable vote on a policy motion.

I hate the Tories!\" before taking that back: \"I can't hate anyone; I'm a liberal.\" Nevertheless he had harsh words for the mayor of London, noting: \"Old Boris Johnson is more popular than David Cameron - doesn't mean to say he'd be good as a prime minister, guys - absolutely not.\"</p> <p>And in case you were wondering, yes, Ashdown did repeat his well-worn line that he is \"the only party leader ever represented in the opinion polls by an asterisk, denoting that no discernible support could be found\".</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Populus polling at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/IX6QlGSi\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:44:41+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Populus polling at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/3EcuqWB8\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:45:38+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50605c17c0e327c3f7c90501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:11:51.152Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's <strong>Paddy Ashdown</strong> on Nick Clegg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itmpYw15sxc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:27:15.990Z\">at 2.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50604db558f9bdd2eeba017e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:06:29.587Z\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Vince Cable's speech - summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Vince Cable</strong> enjoys writing and his speeches often contain relatively subtle messages. That was certainly true of this one, which was ostensibly about growth and the economy, but actually read like the opening bid in the coalition negotiations for 2015.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Vince Cable predicted that the next election would result in a hung parliament and he insisted that the Lib Dems would be able to work with either of the two main parties in the national interest.</strong> At least, that's how I read Cable's peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After over two years in government we are battle hardened but certainly not war weary. None of us knows exactly how it will end. But we all know we must fight the next general election as a totally independent, national, credible challenger for power.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe actually that the British people will want to entrust their future to any one party next time. If Britain wants sustainable growth, competence with compassion, fairness with freedom and more equality, not ever greater division, then that government must have Liberal Democrats at its heart.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable joked about the reports that he has exchanged text messages with Ed Miliband - \"I have good communications with politicians across the political spectrum,\" he said - and his speech indicated a willingness to work with Labour as well as the Tories. He had this to say about Ed Balls.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our critics on the left say \u2013 \u201ccut more slowly\u201d. The government has already extended the period to eliminate the structural deficit from four to six years. Yet Ed Balls says: \u201cWorkers of the world unite. We need a Plan B. We should not cut the deficit in six years but seven\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds like a jibe, but actually he is saying that there is little difference between Balls's policies and the government's. And Cable was quite positive about George Osborne too. Earlier Danny Alexander (Osborne's Treasury deputy) opened a debate on a motion criticising the Tories (and, by implication, Osborne) over green policies. But Cable was quite complimentary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When we came into government we had to balance competing risks: of aggravating the economic downturn through excessive cuts versus the risk of losing the confidence of lenders. I believe we struck the right balance and adopted a deficit reduction plan. I make no apology for my continued support for that fiscal discipline.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cable said the Lib Dems would not let slow growth lead to further spending cuts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The central point is that the country must not get stuck on a downward escalator where slow or no growth means bigger deficits leading to more cuts and even slower growth. That is the way to economic disaster and political oblivion. We will not let that happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He launched a strong attack on the banks, accusing them of being \"anti-business\" in the past.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our leading banks are often anti-business, especially anti-small business. They threw traditional relationship banking over the side and sold useless insurance and dodgy derivatives instead.</p> <p>Public anger at the greed and stupidity in this industry will continue for a long time. But I am looking forward to, and I want to work with the new generation of sensible bankers to support the real economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that, without the Lib Dems, the Conservative would not have agreed to support the Vickers proposals to divide investment banking from retail banking.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He confirmed that the government would set up a British business bank.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am working with the chancellor to develop a new institution that will combine a billion pounds of new government capital with a larger private sector contribution. This will apply leverage through guarantees to support up to \u00a310bn of finance to small and mid-sized business \u2013 a significant portion of all the lending currently available.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the World at One just now, when asked if the \u00a31bn would be a one-off investment or an annual one, he said it would start as a one-off payment \"for the moment\".</p> <p>He would not say when it would launch, but said he hoped to get it operating quite quickly.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked \"head bangers\" on the Tory right who wanted the government to allow no-fault dismissal.</strong> This was a reference to the so-called \"fire at will\" plan in the Beecroft report.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have seen off the \u2018head bangers\u2019 who want a hire and fire culture and seem to find sacking people an aphrodisiac: totally irrelevant in a country with flexible labour markets which have created over a million private sector jobs in the last two years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked Labour, saying that under Tony Blair it lost its soul.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour can still be a ruthless political machine. But it used to be a lot more than that. It once had a soul and new ideas. Then we had 13 years of rootless New Labour. A hard-earned reputation for economic competence disappeared under the rubble of collapsing banks. Their party\u2019s long-standing commitment to individual freedoms was buried in a graveyard of civil liberties. Principled foreign policy was laid to rest in Iraq. They have scarcely begun the long march back from there.</p> </blockquote> <p>What's interesting about this is that he was not dismissing the party in an unqualified way, and he seemed to express a desire for Labour to change.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He reaffirmed his call for a mansion tax.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know some of you hanker after a Hollande-style assault on top incomes. But we know that very high marginal rates of income tax are counter-productive. If I were advising Monsieur Hollande, I would recommend a \u2018chateau tax\u2019 \u2013 for those of us who never even managed a dumbed-down GCSE in French, that means a \u2018mansion tax\u2019. Core Lib Dem policy. A first step to the proper taxation of wealth and land. It horrifies the Tory backwoodsmen, but it is popular and right.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his World at One interview, Cable told Martha Kearney that she would be \"surprised\" how many Conservatives had an open mind about the mansion tax idea. Asked about whether George Osborne would support it, Cable said that he still had \"some persuasion to do\" but that Osborne was \"an intelligent man who sees the pros and cons\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He mocked Andrew Mitchell, making a joke about being a pleb.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now I don't know what Boris and Dave got up to in Eton. Perhaps a pillow fight got out of control in the dormitories. I have been told, however, that jokes about social class are not good for the unity of the coalition. But as a mere pleb, I couldn't resist it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cable paid tribute to Clegg's leadership.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of our central aims as Liberal Democrats is to show that coalitions work. And Nick Clegg\u2019s major contribution as leader is to do just that. At a time of crisis, coalition government was and is still the only way forward \u2013 and it required considerable political courage from Nick to make it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable said Clegg's contribution \"is to do just that\", but the text released to journalists in advance was not quite so loyal. It quoted Cable as saying Clegg's contribution \"has been to do just that\".</p> <p>I've described the speech as the opening bid in the coalition negotiations for 2015. Of course, Cable also left open the question of who might be leading the Lib Dems in those negotiations. There was nothing disloyal in the speech, but it will have reminded Lib Dem delegates very effectively that, were Clegg to stand down, another candidate is available.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:44:07.834Z\">at 2.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5060555c58f9bdd2eeba0182\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:43:08.112Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-21696a0e-00a7-48b3-b615-f8dd985d6c18\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348490570297/2dceb193-4485-4abc-85af-394d1e659f30-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg and other senior Liberal Democrats applaud Cable's speech\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg and other senior Liberal Democrats applaud Cable's speech.

Here are the main points. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg rejected suggestions that his call for a new tax on the wealthy meant that he was determined to \"soak the middle class\".</strong> He was responding to<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2207618/Lib-Dem-conference-2012-Nick-Clegg-wants-hit-millions-earning-50k-higher-tax-bills.html?openGraphAuthor=%2Fhome%2Fsearch.html%3Fs%3D%26authornamef%3DJames%2BChapman&amp;videoPlayerURL=http%3A%2F%2Fc.brightcove.com%2Fservices%2Fviewer%2Ffederated_f9%3FisVid%3D1%26isUI%3D1%26publisherID%3D1418450360%26playerID%3D72484359001%26domain%3Dembed%26videoId%3D&amp;hasBCVideo=true&amp;BCVideoID=1857481223001\"> the Daily Mail splash, which is headlined today - Clegg: Soak the middle class.</a> Asked if this was accurate, Clegg (who has attacked Daily Mail reporting in the past) said it wasn't.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you are referring to a Daily Mail headline. It won't surprise [you] that I'm not going to do what the Daily Mail is suggesting. We are not planning to soak anybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if those earning more than \u00a350,000 would pay more tax in the way that the Mail was suggesting, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You will not be soaked in the way that the Daily Mail [is suggesting].</p> </blockquote> <p>He stressed that those earning more than \u00a350,000 were earning well above the national average.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said a mansion tax was still the Lib Dems' preferred means of getting more tax out of the wealthy.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our focus does remain on very high value property for the simple reason that I think most people in this country just don\u2019t understand why people who have very high value properties just don\u2019t pay their fair share, in the way that everybody does.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 He claimed that there was a \"dividing line\" in politics between those who wanted extra tax revenue to come from the rich and those who wanted it to come from the poor.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I'm saying is that there's a big dividing line in British politics between people who, when asked to reach to make more savings, immediately ask the poorest to make more savings and [those who think the opposite].</p> </blockquote> <p>This was interesting because it implies that the Lib Dems and Labour are on one side of a dividing line, while the Tories are on the other.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that many rich people accepted that it was fair to ask them to pay more.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My experience is people, decent fair-minded folk who are earning far, far more than the national average understand that they do need to make a fair contribution because that's what the nation demands right now.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He defended Vince Cable's right not to rule out standing for the Lib Dem leadership at some point in the future.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think any politician should start ruling out doing anything well into the future ... Of course, Vince is entirely right and entitled to say what he says about his own feelings about politics and about his future.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg said that in future political parties would increasingly distinguish between manifesto policies which were priorities and those which were not.</strong> They would identify which policies they would \"die in the ditch for\", and which were \u201csubject to circumstances and resources and so on\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that distinction is one that parties will increasingly have to make in British politics as we move towards greater plurality and more coalitions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T10:26:54.456Z\">at 11.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50602616c0e38ada8001633b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:21:26.291Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne is not willing to draw a line under the Andrew Mitchell affair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/robindbrant/status/250162546676477952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Lib dem home off min Jeremy Browne adds to pressure on Mitchell, tells bbc still 'loose ends to be tied up'.</p>&mdash; Robin Brant (@robindbrant) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robindbrant/status/250162546676477952\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:19:33+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5060240cc0e38ada80016339\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:12:44.162Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Paul Owen has written<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/business-bank-vince-cable-thick-of-it\"> a lovely blog about the similarities between Saturday's episode of The Thick of It and today's British business bank announcement from Vince Cable. </a>Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Saturday's episode of The Thick of It saw the show's Lib Dem surrogates - junior minister Fergus and his adviser Adam - bumble their way into accidentally agreeing to a pretty young female economist's proposal of a \u00a32bn micro-bank to \"set up a network of micro-credit lenders at neighbourhood level\" to help businesses such as \"sisters who want to set up a pop-up baker's in a disused travel agents\". Cable's bank is not quite as hip as that, helping only \"the manufacturers, exporters and high-growth companies that power our economy\", and while The Thick of It's bank is funded by a Robin Hood tax which will \"steal from the fat cats and raise enough seed capital for hundreds of start-up funds for fledgling businesses\", the business secretary's will be paid for by \"underspends\" in Whitehall departments.</p> <p>Nevertheless, although Cable is unlikely to echo Adam's verdict that the idea is \"so fucking us it's brilliant\" when he addresses the Lib Dem conference today, he could do a lot worse than copy Fergus's description of the bank as \"a helping hand for hands-on people - making sure the can-doers don't get canned.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506021ad58f90bd4c3fd4ac2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:08:48.619Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the more interesting Lib Dem stories and articles in the papers today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9561957/Never-mind-all-those-badgers-weve-got-to-save-the-Cleggster.html\">\u2022 Boris Johnson in the Daily Telegraph defends Nick Clegg, saying he is a natural Tory.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quick, before it is too late.

They'd be unlikely to get the necessary two-thirds majority, but a simple numerical one would be such a stinging rejection of Clegg that he would have to resign. Then, the argument goes, the party could find a different leader (probably Cable, as a stopgap) for the 2015 election, and save as many seats as possible.</p> <p>Usually, we're told that conference plots are fantasies, and we should concentrate on the policies.

German officials are believed to remain unconvinced such arrangements could not be challenged in the European courts. They are also looking for watertight assurances about retaining EADS jobs in Germany.</p> <p>Meanwhile BAE's backroom campaign in Washington is expected to be led by industry veteran Linda Hudson, who heads up BAE's North American operations, and supported by her chief lobbyist Erin Moseley, who has previously worked for rivals Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics.</p> <p>The London stock market-listed company is already one of the biggest lobbying firms on Capitol Hill, spending <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000583&amp;year=2012\" title=\"\">more than $4m a year since 2005</a> according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Moreover, in the run up to November's US election, BAE has channelled more campaign donations to US politicians than any other non-American multinational.</p> <p>It is illegal for companies to give directly to federal election candidates in America, but businesses \u2013 including US subsidiaries of multinational groups \u2013 are permitted to set up so-called political action committees. PACs, typically staffed with company lobbyists, pool donations from US staff and distribute them in the interests of the company.</p> <p>BAE Systems' PAC has given $602,500 to a spread of candidates with 61% of funds going to Republican politicians. Among the largest contributors to the PAC were Hudson and Moseley.</p> <p>Those receiving campaign financing from the BAE committee included 14 members of the 21-strong Congressional armed services <a href=\"http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/readiness\" title=\"\">subcommittee on readiness</a>.</p> <p>The treatment BAE receives in Washington is likely to become a hot election issue as the firm employs almost 40,000 staff in important electoral states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.</p> <p>The company was forced to temporarily lay off hundreds of workers at its York plant in Pennsylvania this summer because of delays to a government contract for Bradley armoured vehicles. Since then it has warned that the impact of impending defence spending cutbacks and reduced US military activity overseas could be much more severe.</p> <p>The impact of likely defence spending cuts in the US and Britain is also thought to be high on the agenda for BAE's political friends in Westminster. A spokesman for David Cameron yesterday said the prime minister had discussed the potential EADS merger with his German and French counterparts.</p> <p>\"Given the nature of the companies' activities, the government will clearly have some involvement and we need to ensure that the UK's public interest is properly protected,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>\"We are working with the companies to ensure that that is the case. We are also talking to people in other countries about this \u2026 Clearly, the companies have activities in all three countries and you would expect us to stay in close contact on it. We have an interest in ensuring that the UK's interests are properly protected and we will do that.\"</p> <p>Cameron has yet to speak to Barack Obama about the proposed takeover, which is expected to see EADS shareholders control up to 60% of the enlarged group while BAE investors would have 40%.</p> <p>Underlying the level of political interest in the deal, MPs on the defence select committee announced they would review the proposed merger, announcing they intened to call evidence from next month.</p> <p>Despite the British government holding a \"golden share\" in BAE \u2013 which effectively gives it powers of veto over proposed changes of ownership judged to harm the UK national interest \u2013 the group generates 47% of sales from America, its largest market.</p> <p>The US arm works shoulder-to-shoulder with other magic circle American defence contractors on some of the most sensitive defence programmes undertaken by the Pentagon, including the F-35 joint strike fighter programme which is developing a radar-evading jet plane.</p> <p>In order to do so, BAE operates under a strict Special Security Arrangement designed to protect nation security projects. The agreement stipulates, for example, that senior BAE staff should all be American citizens.</p> <p>On its website, BAE says of its lobbying activity: \"In the defence and security industry, lobbying is often closely related to acquisitions because governments and their agencies are the direct customers for our products and services. This means that our lobbying activities include informing politicians or government officials about our products and services, or advocating solutions to programmes that are important to our customers and end users in the armed forces and other government organisations.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A 'guru' who is accused of cheating three generations of a wealthy and aristocratic French family out of their fortune went on trial on Monday .</p> <p>For a decade Thierry Tilly brainwashed 11 members of the de V\u00e9drines family into believing that their lives were threatened by a secret masonic plot that only he could save them from, say investigators.</p> <p>After persuading them to barricade themselves first into their ancestral chateau then within a suburban house in Oxford and employing what police described as \"acts of torture and barbarism\", he is accused of tricking the family into handing over up to \u20ac4.5m (\u00a33.6m).</p> <p>At the Palais de Justice in Bordeaux on Monday, Tilly, 48, went on trial for \"fraud, abuse of weakness, violence against the vulnerable, and holding people against their will for up to seven days\".</p> <p>The story of the de V\u00e9drines and Thierry Tilly is as mysterious and convoluted as the plot of a Dan Brown novel, to which it is has frequently been likened. Investigators and lawyers are at a loss to explain how the small, bespectacled law school dropout and failed businessman with a conviction for fraud, convinced the de V\u00e9drines to part with their home, along with the family silver and their entire fortune.</p> <p>The de V\u00e9drines' matriarch Guillemette, who died in 2010 aged 97, and her children Philippe, 64, an executive with Shell Oil, Charles-Henri, 54, a gynaecologist and local politician, and their sister Ghislaine, 56, the director of a secretarial school in Paris, were, said friends, proud of their status as protestant nobles but were unlikely dupes. It was Ghislaine who introduced Tilly, who worked as an administrator at her school, to the family in the late 1990s. He claimed to be a descendent of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg nobility and said his communist grandmother had held \"salons\" with former socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.</p> <p>Investigators say it was Tilly's claims of connections in high places and money-making schemes that first attracted the de V\u00e9drines to him. By 2001, after Tilly convinced family members they were the targets of a masonic plot, they had barricaded themselves in their ancestral home, the turreted manor house Ch\u00e2teau Martel near Monflanquin, a pretty medieval village in the Lot-et-Garonne.</p> <p>As well as Guillemette and her children, the group included Charles-Henri and his wife Christine's children, Guillaume, now 24, Amaury, 22, Diana, 17, and Ghislaine's two children, Guillemette, 25 and Fran\u00e7ois, 23.</p> <p>When Ghislaine's husband, Jean Marchand, a business journalist, expressed his scepticism of Tilly, he was banished and accused by his wife and brothers-in-law of belonging to a \"network of evil\".</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/aristocrats-and-demons-201008\" title=\"\">article in Vanity Fair in 2010</a>, Marchand described Tilly as a sort of \"brain burglar\". \"He opened their heads, took out their brains and put in a new one.\"</p> <p>After the de V\u00e9drines, who had increasingly withdrawn from the world, stopped paying their taxes the French fiscal authorities seized Ch\u00e2teau Martel's furnishings and auctioned them off. In 2007, Tilly took them to Oxford, where they lived in a succession of anonymous suburban homes, some of which still have rent outstanding.</p> <p>Tilly was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 after Christine de V\u00e9drines told police she had been violently abused by her family and Tilly because she had failed to provide the \"key\" to the fortune they had convinced themselves she possessed.</p> <p>At the Palais de Justice in Bordeaux on Monday, Alexandre Novion, the lawyer for Tilly, who has denied all the charges, said he was \"confident\". He rejected suggestions his client was a \"guru\", claiming the affair was \"a power game\".</p> <p>After seeing Tilly, a small man in a black polo neck and frameless glasses in the dock on Monday, Ghislaine de V\u00e9drines told journalists outside the court in Bordeaux: \"He's a liar and a storyteller.\" She added: \"I know very well how he tries to get the upper hand, except here he's in front of professionals, which wasn't the case when he was with us. He kidnapped us, telling one of us one thing and another something else, and set us against one another.\"</p> <p>Marchand, who alerted the authorities, said that he hoped the trial would be a warning to others in a similar situation. \"That man has made a career out of mental manipulation,\" he said.</p> <p>A second man, Jacques Gonzales, 65, linked to Tilly, who has also denied charges of fraud and abuse of weakness, is also on trial.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>An <a href=\"http://collateral.newsflashconnect.co.uk/RemoteStorage/Judiciary/Releases/451/Cregan%20statement%20in%20court.doc\" title=\"\">order was made in Manchester crown court </a>this morning preventing reporting of any proceedings in the Dale Cregan case until after the conclusion of the trial; it excludes the trial from its scope which means that, unless further restrictions are imposed, once the jury is sworn in it will be business as usual as far as court reporting of the case is concerned. Nevertheless, the decision is worth more than a second glance.</p> <p>When a criminal case begins legal limitations on public discussion kick in automatically: reports of preparatory hearings are limited to basic facts such as the name of the accused and the offences; pre-trial hearings cannot be reported until the conclusion of the trial; and anything likely to cause a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the proceedings is prohibited by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/section/2\" title=\"\">Contempt of Court Act 1981</a> from the point of arrest.</p> <p>His Honour Judge Gilbart QC imposed additional reporting restrictions in Cregan's case on the ground of \"very real risk of prejudice\". He was not concerned, he said, about the \"very proper expressions of loss\" from the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, but about other information including \"press conference answers\" and \"accounts\", which have been \"widely disseminated on the internet, in broadcasts, and in newspapers.\" Talking about the \"extensive material\" published, which may be relevant to cases against other defendants, the judge said: \"the time has come for that flow of material and comment to cease.\"</p> <p>Cregan was charged with murder last week following the death of two police officers and the background and circumstances surrounding those events are, as the judge observed, of \"intense interest\" to the public; then again there is the open justice principle to consider and newsworthiness is not a reason to impose reporting restrictions.</p> <p>According to guidance published by the <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Guidance/crown_court_reporting_restrictions_021009.pdf\" title=\"\">Judicial Studies Board</a> (JSB) in 2009 an order postponing publication of court reports can be made under section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act where a court considers it is \"necessary to avoid a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those or other proceedings\". Such orders are most often made where the progress and outcome of one trial may impact on another. While a court may make a section 4(2) order to prevent potential prejudice to a future trial, the JSB guidance says judges should keep in mind that memories of news reports will fade and that juries can be expected to follow a trial judge's direction to decide cases only on the evidence they see and hear in court.</p> <p>\"This court is determined to see that the fairness of any trial is not overborne by the publication of material or comment which could affect the jury,\" the judge said today, but that stretches the purpose of a section 4(2) order. The JSB guidance, which is jointly published with the Newspaper Society, Society of Editors and Times Newspapers, points out that section 4(2) gives the court power only to postpone reports of legal proceedings, everything else, including prejudicial comment and information already in the public domain, is a matter of judgment for the publisher, who risks liability under the Contempt of Court Act if he or she gets it wrong.</p>",
  "<p>The future of one of Iran's great political survivors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has been called into question after two of his children were taken to prison within three days of each other.</p> <p>The son and daughter of former Iranian president have been taken to Tehran's Evin prison and face separate anti-state allegations.</p> <p>Such a degree of pressure on a former president is unprecedented in the history of the Islamic republic, especially for Rafsanjani, who is believed to have played an instrumental role in the appointment of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the supreme leader after the death in 1989 of the Islamic revolution's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's son, Mehdi Hashemi, was detained on Monday after returning to Iran from a self-imposed exile and spending three years of studying in the UK.</p> <p>Local agencies reported that he was summoned for questioning a day after arriving back in Tehran and was later taken into custody after a warrant for his arrest was issued. \"Mehdi Hashemi was told about the accusations against him and later taken to jail,\" reported the semi-official Ilna news agency.</p> <p>He is believed to be held on accusations of having links to Iran's opposition Green movement and the popular unrest in the aftermath of the country's 2009 disputed presidential election.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's daughter, Faezeh Hashemi, a political activist and former Iranian MP, was taken to Evin on Saturday to serve a six-month prison term after being found guilty of \"spreading propaganda against the regime\".</p> <p>In January, Tehran's revolutionary court sentenced her on a conviction that is believed to be the result of an interview she gave to an opposition website, <a href=\"http://www.roozonline.com/english.html\" title=\"\">Roozonline</a>, in which she blamed regime supporters for harassing her in public. The former MP infuriated hardliners by publicly supporting the opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 and participating in post-election protests against the vote's results.</p> <p>While in the UK, her brother made headlines over separate allegations that he was studying a five-year DPhil on Iran's constitution at Oxford University without meeting the English language criteria. The university, which investigated the allegations, backed the student although Mehdi Hashemi never attempted to appear in public and demonstrate his language skills.</p> <p>Last year, a Canadian court found him liable in absentia for imprisoning and torturing a rival in the 1990s, allegations he has categorically denied.</p> <p>In March that year, his father, under pressure from opponents, abandoned his position as the head of a powerful clerical body charged with appointing and dismissing the supreme leader.</p> <p>Rafsanjani presides over Iran's expediency council which mediates between the parliament and the guardian council, a body that vets all legislation.</p> <p>In the past, the 78-year-old moderate politician used to enjoy a great deal of influence and was seen as crucial for the survival of the regime because of his mediatory power. But his authority has diminished since he lost the 2005 presidential election to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>Pressure on Rafsanjani's family has grown since then. His other son, Mohsen Hashemi, resigned under pressure from Ahmadinejad's government as the head of Tehran's metro organisation in 2011.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's reputation was also damaged in the past decade by widespread allegations by regime and opposition supporters that he and his family were financially corrupt.</p> <p>\"Despite all the setbacks, Rafsanjani still has relatively good influence among supporters of the regime albeit not necessarily with those in power,\" said an Iranian analyst based in London who asked not to be named. \"As a moderate figure, he still can be considered as Iran's way out of the current stalemate with the international community, and that's why he might rise to power in no time if Khamenei decides to rely on him for the survival of the regime.\"</p> <p>Rafsanjani is also a moderate supporter of Iran's opposition Green movement and its leaders Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who are currently held under house arrest.</p>",
  "<p>The public is twice as likely to trust police as it is to trust the government, according to an ICM/Guardian poll taken as the row over allegations that the chief whip Andrew Mitchell had called an armed officer a \"pleb\" escalated.</p> <p>In a poll conducted over the weekend, while the story of Mitchell's altercation at the gates of Downing Street dominated the press and the airwaves, 79% of respondents said they trusted the police very or fairly strongly, more than double the 37% who said the same about the UK government.</p> <p>The police service will be delighted to obtain such positive ratings only a couple of weeks after <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/report/HIP_report.pdf\" title=\"\">an independent inquiry </a>into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster implicated the South Yorkshire force in manoeuvrings to blame the victims and cover up their own failings.</p> <p>The police are not only much more trusted than the government, but are also trusted somewhat more than the courts and lawyers they work with: 63% of voters say they very or fairly strongly trust the legal system.</p> <p>The 79% trust rating for the police also represents an advance on the 55% rating they obtained when ICM fielded a similar question in an online poll in <a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.com/pdfs/2010_feb_guardian_trust_poll\" title=\"\">February 2010</a> (pdf), with a particularly marked increase in the proportion trusting them very strongly.</p> <p>The poll was commissioned in the wake of the murder of two female officers in Greater Manchester last week, which has produced a wave of sympathy for the service. Trust in the police is spread remarkably evenly across the sexes, age groups and social classes.</p> <p>On 15 November, across most of England and Wales the public will vote to select new police and crime commissioners \u2013 individuals from outside the force who will be charged with setting strategies and budgets. The pending elections have received scant publicity and there are fears of a low turnout, but in so far as voters have a view about this initiative it is positive.</p> <p>In the ICM poll some 48% believe that the plans will improve the quality of policing, as against only 28% who fear that it will worsen the quality. With 24% of voters saying they don't know, the government will be pleased to learn that its proposals \u2013 which are controversial with many in the force \u2013 are endorsed by a 20-point margin.</p> <p>Polling earlier in the month <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/8dl82la234/Reputation_12092012_originaldoc_HTEditv2.pdf\" title=\"\">by YouGov</a> also indicated that the elections for the new commissioners could be propitious for the Tories. It suggested that the Conservatives held a seven point edge over Labour on law and order \u2013 revealing them to be preferred by a 30%-23% as the party \"best able to handle\" the problems in this area. The byelection in Corby \u2013 which was caused by the resignation from parliament of Louise Mensch, and looks tricky for the Tories \u2013 is likely to be held the same day. If so, the Conservatives would be especially grateful for a string of strong Conservative showings in the ballots for police and crime commissioners.</p> <p>\u2022 ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,006 adults aged 18+ by telephone on 21 23 September 2012.

  "<h2>THE END</h2> <p>JT'accuse!</p> <p>Not for the first time, the Fiver has spent the day wondering what a loveable teatime email can call John Terry. \"EBLJT\" has become untenable, see. E's no good, because Terry will not be adding to his 78 England caps after he retired from international football ahead of an FA hearing into the accusation that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand during last season's QPR v Chelsea match. He had already been found not guilty by a magistrate who called his version of events \"highly unlikely\", but not impossible. The L? Best ask Andre Villas-Boas about that. And the B's knacked, too, after Terry retired from international football ahead of the hearing in to the accusation etc and so on. So plain old JT it is.</p> <p>\"I feel the FA, in pursuing charges against me where I have already been cleared in a court of law, have made my position with the national team untenable,\" said Terry in a statement released last night. Did these words really come from the same lips across which the instruction \"Man up\" used to pass with chest-swelling regularity? Is this the fella who would never turn his back on England, come what may? Say it ain't so! \"I have always given my all and it breaks my heart to make this decision,\" he warbled on, accompanied by a lone and slightly off-key violin played by a small boy with damp Disney eyes.</p> <p>\"I don't see how we've made it untenable,\" said the FA's Alex Horne today, cutting in with a piercing sax-jazz lick, before describing the magistrates' court as \"a very different process\" than the FA. \"I could separate the two in my mind, but it doesn't look like he could,\" Horne added. The Emmental logic in Terry's decision seems to be that retirement ends his England career intact - rather than allowing the FA, which has a 99.5% conviction rate, to cut it short on their terms. And so ends a career that has spanned four major international tournaments and only occasionally forced anyone else to resign.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I was talking to the fourth official and they sent me off.

  "<h2><strong>What is John Terry accused of?</strong><br></h2> <p>The FA has charged Terry with breaking rule E3(1) and E3(2) in his alleged abuse of Anton Ferdinand, an identical charge to the one Luis Su\u00e1rez faced after his confrontation with Patrice Evra. It says Terry is charged with using \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour\" towards Ferdinand with the further charge that he is alleged to have \"included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Anton Ferdinand\"</p> <h2><strong>Hasn't he already been cleared in a court of law?</strong><br></h2> <p>At the end of a four-day trial in Westminster magistrates' court, the Chelsea captain was cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence. Terry did not deny using the words \"fucking black cunt\" to Ferdinand but maintained he was only sarcastically repeating words that Ferdinand wrongly thought he had used. The chief magistrate summed up by saying: \"It is therefore possible that what he said was not intended as an insult, but rather as a challenge to what he believed had been said to him. In those circumstances, there being a doubt, the only verdict the court can record is one of not guilty\"</p> <h2><strong>What is the case for the defence?</strong><br></h2> <p>The case once more hinges on whether the words were used as an insult, or whether he was repeating an allegation made to him and dismissing it. The defence will also point to paragraph 6.8 of the FA's own rules, which states: \"Where the subject matter of a complaint or matter before the Regulatory Commission has been the subject of previous civil or criminal proceedings, the result of such proceedings and the facts and matters upon which such result is based shall be presumed to be correct and the facts presumed to be true unless it is shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that this is not the case\"</p> <h2><strong>What are his chances of being found not guilty?</strong><br></h2> <p>In 2011 there were 473 FA disciplinary cases with a conviction rate of 99.5%. Terry, who said that his position with England is now untenable, is bound to feel that the scales are therefore tilted against him. In the Su\u00e1rez-Evra case, Su\u00e1rez was found guilty on the \"balance of probability\", a lower standard than the criminal standard of \"beyond all reasonable doubt\"</p> <h2><strong>What punishment could he face?</strong><br></h2> <p>The standard penalty of a four-match ban would be most likely. Su\u00e1rez was given eight matches and a \u00a340,000 fine for his racial abuse of Evra last year, but the FA explained that: \"Given the number of times that Mr Su\u00e1rez used the word 'negro', his conduct is significantly more serious than a one-off use of a racially offensive term and amounts to an aggravating factor\"</p>",
  "<p>Libya's new government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/libyan-authorities-islamist-militia\" title=\"\">issued an ultimatum to its militias</a>: disband and disarm \u2013 or else. The drive to flush out the numerous militia groups that have operated with impunity since the fall of the Gaddafi regime follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/chris-stevens-libya-brutal-death\" title=\"\">the killing of the US ambassador, Chris Stephens</a>, two weeks ago, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/22/unarmed-people-power-libya\" title=\"\">demonstrations over the weekend</a> that saw protesters seize control of several militia headquarters.</p> <p>On the face of it, these moves look promising. Libya's democratically elected rulers are beginning to take responsibility, backed up by a population that has become increasingly dissatisfied with the state's slow progress in establishing itself as the principal power since the upheaval last year.</p> <p>The post-conflict environment has brought ongoing clashes between rival militia groups, clashes between the state and militias, assassinations and turf wars over smuggling routes. Furthermore, the attack on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi was the second of its kind since June \u2013 a month in which the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18401792\" title=\"\">British ambassador to Libya, Dominic Asquith, was also targeted</a>.</p> <p>However, there are still two principal obstacles to sidelining militia groups, including jihadist militias operating in Derna, Libya's Islamist stronghold.</p> <p>While Libyans and international commentators alike have been celebrating the weekend's events as a victory \u2013 in particular the storming of the headquarters of Ansar al-Sharia (the group blamed for the ambassador's killing) \u2013 the militias are simply being driven underground. They have abandoned their bases with their weapons and ammunition, rather than being detained or brought under government control.</p> <p>That will compound existing security problems because it means militias could switch to operating as small units, instead of larger groups that are more easily identified and targeted. The government could still try to eliminate militias in their new form, but it remains doubtful that the state army, usually suited to targeting larger military formations and identifiable headquarters, has the organisation, experience and effectiveness to combat smaller, dispersed units that might continue and even increase their hit-and-run operations.</p> <p>Moreover, this implies that the government is abandoning the idea of a reconciliatory process in favour of direct armed confrontation. That could be problematic in an unstable post-conflict environment that has yet to remedy differences between existing rulers and their predecessors. It could also be detrimental because of the links militias have with local regions and neighbourhoods. Some have extensive tribal, political and familial ties. The ramifications of this will be all the more severe because of the lack of state control and a functioning security force.</p> <p>The extent to which the government intends to see out its pledge to defeat militias remains to be seen \u2013 since it has yet to define the parameters of legal and illegal militias. That means certain groups will not be challenged because of their untouchable status. For example, militias of the Nafusa mountains in the western part of the country, especially those from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/02/libya-releases-icc-officials\" title=\"\">Zintan (who continue to hold Saif Gaddafi</a> despite the government's protests), will retain their autonomy.</p> <p>What this essentially means is that the government will really be able to tackle only the opportunistic militias that emerged after the downfall of the regime. These are groups of armed men that were formed locally to look after their neighbourhoods in the ensuing security vacuum and who may or may not engage in petty criminal activities. However, more robust and broader networks of militias, especially those that developed during the 2011 uprising, will operate as normal.</p> <p>Yet if certain groups are allowed to remain autonomous, that will not only prolong the precarious security environment (as well as tarnishing the political process because of the protection they are given) but also invite smaller groups to join their ranks, making the government's efforts a futile and tokenistic endeavour.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/14/libya-needs-more-than-elections\" title=\"\">a previous article</a> I argued that one realistic approach to security challenges in Libya would be to recognise that the most powerful militia forces will remain the primary force on the ground.</p> <p>It may be that the Libyan government is beginning to accept this reality. But it is imperative to do so as part of a regulated framework \u2013 making militias not just more accountable but also more effective and efficient as law enforcers working in partnership with a centralised state security force.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77693/from-russia-with-love\" title=\"\">From Russia With Love</a> is my favourite James Bond movie, simply because it is the first Bond I ever saw at the cinema. This was at the old Classic in Hendon Central in London, some time in the early 1970s, in an era before Bond films were shown on television, and going to see them at the cinema was a special school-holiday treat. Quite long-in-the-tooth Bond films would be revived on the big screen like this: this was a double bill of From Russia With Love (1963) and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059800/\">Thunderball</a> (1965).</p> <p>What a thrill to hear that incredible theme tune played live (as it were) for the first time, echoing around the cavernous old cinema and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOw2hTBHMvA\">seeing those opening titles</a>: the mysterious circle shunting across the dark screen, Bond walking in profile, turning dramatically face on and firing, the descending curtain of blood. It was like a bad dream or expressionist ballet. Perhaps nothing in any 007 film can ever match the heart-racing thrill of Monty Norman's inspired Bond theme. That was the 007 brand, right there. Then it was time for the title-sequence itself, a fantastically silly image of a belly-dancer on whom the titles were ripplingly projected. To my saucer-eyed 12-year-old self, this was the grownup world as it was meant to be: erotic, exotic, mysterious and dangerous. Actually, it is a Raymond Revuebar vision of adult sophistication.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_USL1yvnaw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_USL1yvnaw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_USL1yvnaw\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view clip</a></p> <p>The movie itself is oddly austere, even downbeat: less extravagant, less gadgety, less action-based than the films which followed \u2013 and actually less than its predecessor, the first Bond film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055928/\">Dr No</a>. It is not actually based in Russia, there is an opening and closing sequence in Venice (the interiors were shot in Pinewood, with stock footage of St Mark's Square), and a Balkan train journey culminates in a truck-versus-helicopter shootout filmed in Scotland. The main location is Istanbul, which is weirdly gloomy and cloudy.</p> <p>Where Fleming's novel straightforwardly presented a Soviet plot to lure Bond with a honeytrap, the movie was not so anti-Russian. Here the villains are not the Soviet group Smersh but the separate terrorist organisation Spectre, to whom key Russian agents have secretly transferred their allegiances, most importantly the comedy hatchet-faced lesbian Col Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya). With much repressed shoulder-stroking and knee-patting, she recruits the beautiful Russian patriot Tatiana (Daniela Bianchi), working for the Soviet embassy in Istanbul. Tatiana still thinks Klebb is working for Mother Russia. The idea is that she will contact British intelligence, claiming to have fallen in love with James Bond from his file photo, and offer them a key decoding device, a \"Lektor\". Spectre's plan is to use Bond's conspicuous presence in Turkey to inflame Anglo-Russian tension \u2013 key murders will be blamed on the British \u2013 and also to wipe out the hated enemy Bond himself, and then to smear his reputation with secretly shot footage of his bedroom action with Tatiana.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396650323\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348480461671/FROM-RUSSIA-WITH-LOVE-010.jpg\" alt=\"FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Connery and Daniela Bianchi in From Russia With Love.

There is something a bit unsexy about Istanbul, but when 007 checks into his hotel room, director Terence Young uses the Bond theme almost deafeningly as Bond checks the place for bugs. For audiences of that generation, it was probably the very fact of going to a hotel which was so exciting. This was the hotel room in which 007 is going to walk around in a state of undress, his gun-holster on display, as superbly casual as an untied bow-tie. Young was rumoured to have tutored Connery in how to walk and talk with style.</p> <p>Then there is a fantastically strange interlude in which Bond is taken by his Turkish liaison Kerim Bey (Pedro Armend\u00e1riz) to a Gypsy camp for an evening's racy entertainment, including a full-on girl-on-girl scalp-clawing catfight. Ooo-er. Two women fighting was very saucy in 70s cinema: I seem to remember it happening in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers, with leering males instantly taking bets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396650324\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348480534973/FROM-RUSSIA-WITH-LOVE-010.jpg\" alt=\"FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The helicopter shootout scene was filmed in Scotland \u2026 From Russia With Love</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/Allstar/Cinetext Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyway, pro-Soviet Bulgarians attack the compound \u2013 huh? \u2013 triggering a shootout like something from a Western, with gypsy caravans going up in flames like chuck-wagons. The next day, Bond appears to have amused himself sexually with both women \u2013 his reward, it seems, for helping defend the camp. They are as compliant and blank as Tatiana. It is wildly absurd, and the macho attitudes are complacent, to say the least. I wonder how Emir Kusturica would have directed this scene.</p> <p>Watched again, From Russia With Love is paced very slowly, even dourly, compared to what is expected of the franchise now. It almost seems like something by Le Carr\u00e9.<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dugixwBbnOE\"> Matt Monro's beautifully clear, bell-like voice singing the theme song</a> also gives it a certain melancholy.</p> <p>Connery's face is still compelling, though: most handsome when set in a rictus of disapproval. When Tatiana appears to have betrayed him \u2013 and Rosa Klebb is about to kick him with her dagger-boot \u2013 Connery's face is almost luminous with anger. Again, his strangely low-tech \"lion-tamer\" fight with Klebb, fending her off with a chair, is one of the most memorable things about the film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396650325\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348480353795/FROM-RUSSIA-WITH-LOVE-010.jpg\" alt=\"FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Connery and Pedro Armend\u00e1riz</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/Allstar/Cinetext Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert Shaw almost steals the picture, as Grant, the blond Spectre killer sent to destroy Bond. Klebb tests his fitness by smashing him in the stomach with some knuckledusters. He hardly flinches! Grant is utterly silent until his final scenes on the train with Bond, passing himself off as a British agent \u2013 suddenly, he becomes a terribly British fellow called \"Nash\". He appears quite the good chap, though with a hint of menace and something not quite right. These edgy dialogue scenes with Bond \u2013 who coldly acknowledges that he looks \"fit\" \u2013 are the best thing in the film. They aren't homoerotic as such, but they have that masculine competitiveness, a testing of prestige and male display. When \"Nash\" orders red wine with his fish at dinner, 007 realises that this ought to have tipped him off.</p> <p>In the final analysis, Connery's 007 is not very obviously in love with Tatiana (he doesn't even seem to fancy her that much) but Bond's glorious and radiant self-love more than makes up for it, and their marital status on the train in those later sequences gives this film a distinctive sort of maturity. It may seem grainy and fusty compared to the all-action tongue-in-cheek spectaculars that came later, but it's the Bond closest to my heart.</p> <p><strong>Favourite line: </strong> [after killing dagger-booted Rosa Klebb]: \"She had her kicks!\"</p> <p><strong>Favourite gadget: </strong>Throwing knife (that never leaves his case)</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://guardianfilm.tumblr.com/image/32256197417\">Read the Guardian's original 1963 review of From Russia With Love here</a></strong></p> <p></p> <p><em>My Favourite Bond Film continues tomorrow with Philip French on Dr No</em></p>",

She is bound to receive comparisons with Lana Del Rey. In fact, she already has received comparisons with her, hence the confidence of our assertion.</p> <p>We don't know what her real name is, but she was Eddi Lines for a while and, before that, Ivana XL. Like Lizzie Grant, she doesn't just arrive fully formed, she's been making music for a while. She was apparently born in Las Vegas (\"apparently\" because in these instances a fictional backstory is a given) and moved a lot with her mother \"for many different reasons\". She went to art college in Savannah, Georgia, where she studied painting for a year before heading back to New York where she began waitressing and playing shows. These days, she says, she spends her time \"in fear of darkness and getting mugged while holed up in NYC\". And though she accepts that there is a film-noir ambience to her music, she denies she is overtly influenced by the past. \"I really try to not reference the past in my music,\" she says. \"I think it might sound 'old' because I prefer to use real instruments.\" Of her favourite musicians, which range from Scott Walker to Smog, the ones whose influence you can actually discern in her songs include Lucinda Williams, Billie Holiday and Nina Simone \u2013 when asked what song, from any era or genre, she wishes she'd written, she chooses <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZmMC26v7hc\" title=\"\">Don't Smoke in Bed</a>.</p> <p>Front's music strives for that simplicity and solemnity, that eerie, dusty charm, and the choking sense of sadness of a woman repeatedly scorned, surviving \u2013 just \u2013 with dignity intact. The track that's been earning her a lot of attention, <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/eddifront/gigantic\" title=\"\">Gigantic</a>, has a similar devastated feel to Simone's. Against stark piano and slithers of acoustic guitar, Front sweetly and huskily details the end of an affair like someone on the numb, other side of pain. \"I'll crawl out of this hole soon enough,\" she sings, and it turns out to have been more than a relationship \u2013 it was a marriage. \"I'll take my ring off, sell the car \u2026\" Not that there are any hard feelings: \"I wish you hell,\" she adds, chillingly, comparing love to addiction (\"I've always been slow to get off of some drugs/ To let go of some loves\"). She explained recently: \"It's a break-up song. Well, it was a particularly difficult break up.\"</p> <p>Her three other songs are very much in the same deep blue vein. <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/eddifront/texas\" title=\"\">Texas</a> features sombre piano with an undertow of synthy menace over which Front's cute multi-tracked nicotine rasp breathes wantonly about \"eating bananas and riding a big black stallion\" like a less ethereal, more hot'n'horny <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBdH6SjBEX8\" title=\"\">Julee Cruise</a> \u2013 fully expect this music to be described as Lynchian.

  "<p>I feel a bit of a fraud giving tips on how to write about zombies, as the \"monsters\" in my books (the Enemy series) are not really zombies at all. Technically they're sickos - diseased adults who are so badly infected by a mysterious disease that they behave like classic, text book, cannibal zombies. ie they are mindless killing machines who only want to rip your guts out and eat them. Since the only people in the books not affected by the disease are kids younger than 15, it's basically kids v zombies (or, as I say, sickos).</p> <p>The main thing that makes my sickos not zombies is that they haven't died and come back to life. You'd think this was the main ingredient of a zombie story, but nowadays the term \"zombie\" covers a wide range of monsters. I think any mass of sick humans who have turned psychotic can be lumped under the zombie banner. So we can talk about 28 Days Later as a zombie film even though the director, Danny Boyle, calls his monsters The Infected. And what about I Am Legend? In the original book they're vampires. I'm not exactly sure what they're meant to be in the recent film, and it's a shame that they were CGI as it looks like Will Smith is being attacked by cartoon characters. Not good. The whole point of zombies, and what makes them really scary, is that they're people. </p> <p>So what I'm saying is that my tips here can cover any stories in which zombie-style humans attack other humans, whether we call them zombies, sickos, the infected, crazies or just nutters. To be honest, my tips here can cover any horror story at all, really. The rules are just the same.</p> <p><strong>1. Please don't die\u2026</strong></p> <p>The most important thing is that the reader has to care about the non-zombie characters in your story. You don't necessarily have to like them all, but you have to get to know them and care about what happens to them. If the reader can identify with the people they are reading about, then they will be much more scared for them if they are put in danger. So you need to work hard at creating some memorable and likeable characters. As I say, you can also throw in some unlikable ones to spice up the mix and make the sympathetic ones even more likable in contrast. Your characters can change, the likable ones don't all have to be heroes, and you can have an unlikable one step up and save the day. But they have to feel real. That way when they get chased around, when they get cornered, when the zombies are getting closer, ready to rip their guts out, and you can smell the rotting meat on their breath, with any luck your reader will be sweating and shaking and praying that their favourites don't get hurt. Then it's up to you, you are in control, you can choose to let your characters live or die, whatever feels dramatically right. If we don't get to know the characters, if we don't care about them, then the story will just be a lot of splatter and gore, which will be fun for a couple of pages and then become incredibly boring. You might as well be reading about the dummies they hack to pieces on Deadliest Warrior (my boys' favourite TV show). It has to hurt. As I said above, this rule applies to any horror writing, hell, it applies to all writing, full stop.</p> <p><strong>2. I'm not just a zombie, you know, I'm a person too\u2026</strong></p> <p>The same rule applies to creating your monsters. One of the problems with writing about zombies is that they're quite limited and what they do is quite repetitive. You can write one really good zombie attack, after that it's hard to keep things interesting and varied, and frightening (It's the same with any monster, really. Like sharks. Jaws was a great film. Jaws 2,3,4 and 5 were increasingly rubbish). Zombies only do one thing - they rise from the dead and slowly and surely advance... You can't reason with them, you can't argue with them, they're not scared of anything, they will just keep coming until they get hold of you and then\u2026 It's gut-munching time! If you're not careful, once you've had this happen once or twice you'll be running out of ways to keep it frightening. So if there's any way you can make your zombies more interesting it really helps. Make your zombies characters, not just a faceless mass (although faceless masses can be very effective when used properly). It's difficult to give zombies character because they are, by their nature, pretty brainless, but one thing you can do is make them look different to each other. You can have a lot of fun with this - you can have a zombie bride, a zombie construction worker, a zombie policeman or soldier, a cheerleader, an emo\u2026 Give the reader something to remember them by. And give your lead zombies names. I have several sickos in my books who I hope are memorable \u2013 like St George, the sicko king, who killed his own son, Pez, a zombie with no lower jaw, The Green Man, who is a sicko covered in green mould, and Bluetooth, a sicko with a Bluetooth headset stuck in his ear. It makes it much more fun and satisfying when you kill them, as well, if we know who they are.</p> <p><strong>3. Love hurts\u2026</strong></p> <p>The scariest and most distressing scenes in zombie stories are when someone we know and love comes back from the dead. It might be a character's best friend, their mother, their child, their boyfriend\u2026 It's bad enough that they're died, it's even worse that they've come back to life as a rotting animated corpse, but the worst thing of all is that they now want to kill you\u2026 and eat you. That's pretty heavy stuff and taps into our childhood nightmares. So you need to include at least one bit in your story when something like this happens. The hero in your story is then faced with a dilemma and will have to ask the question \u2013 What do I do to this person I love? Do I smash their brains out? Do I try to run? Do I let them eat me? What\u2026? Help\u2026! Dear God, help me\u2026</p> <p><strong>4. I hate your guts\u2026</strong></p> <p>Zombie stories, like all the best horror stories, are about death and decay and disease and how horrible the insides of our bodies are. We don't want to think about all the yucky stuff squashed in there, our blood, our hearts, our livers and kidneys and lungs, most of all we don't want to think about our intestines\u2026 But zombie stories force us to think about these things, to confront our fears, in, I hope, an entertaining and thought-provoking way. Zombie stories remind us that we are all, in the end, just meat. You wouldn't feel you'd got your money's worth if you watched a zombie film and at some point we didn't see someone's guts being pulled out. There's something really, really revolting about intestines. They're slimy and pale and bluish and they're full of\u2026. Well, we all know what they're full of. You have to give your reader what they want. Gore. And lots of it. </p> <p><strong>5. It's not really about zombies you know\u2026 </strong></p> <p>The best zombie stories are not really about the walking dead at all. The best zombie stories use zombies as a metaphor. Zombies are human, after all. Put a load of zombies in a shopping mall and you've got a satire on our mindless consumer society, put them in the houses of parliament and you've got a satire on politics and politicians, set the army on them and you've got a satire on war and the military, put them in the church and you've got a satire on the followers of organised religion. Over the years zombie films have been about a lot of things - the Vietnam war, racism, communism, vegetarianism, AIDS\u2026 Zombie stories can be a good way to write about something else important that interests you (My own books are about children's fear of adults and also ask questions about the best way to set up and run a civilised society). Just make sure you put a lot of spilled guts in there as well.</p> <p><em>Charlie Higson is the author of the Young Bond series which has now sold over a million copies in the UK and has been translated into 24 different languages.

  "<h2>Torrey Smith is a remarkable man</h2> <p>Everybody reacts differently to grief. Whether in professional sports or any other walk of life, there will always be some people who find that work provides an outlet \u2013 a necessary channel for emotions and energies that would otherwise be overwhelming. Likewise, there will be others who find it impossible to even contemplate their jobs while coping with the loss of a loved one. Torrey Smith chose the former option on Sunday night, suiting up to play for Baltimore against New England less than 24 hours after discovering that his younger brother Tevin Jones had died in a motorcycle accident. \"It was tough. I didn't know until 4 o'clock if I was going to play,\" Smith said afterwards. \"I only had like an hour of sleep. Emotionally, I didn't know how I was going to hold up.\"</p> <p>In the event, he held up better than anyone could have imagined. Smith's performance was nothing short of remarkable, the receiver hauling in six catches for 127 yards and two touchdowns in a 31-30 win over the Patriots. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000065306/Smith-25-yard-TD-catch\">The first score came at a time when his team desperately needed a kick-start</a>, trailing 13-0 in the second quarter. The second brought them to within two points with three-and-a-half minutes to play: setting up an eventual 31-30 win.<br> \"There's not a better guy on this team than Torrey Smith,\" said his team-mate, Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta. \"For him to come out and play the way he did today was unbelievable. I can't even begin to put myself in his shoes.\"</p> <h2>It may be time to take the Arizona Cardinals seriously</h2> <p>Three weeks into the NFL season, and just three teams remain unbeaten. The Houston Texans had never before started a season 3-0, yet neither their perfect start nor that of the Atlanta Falcons could be deemed as truly shocking. Each has recorded noteworthy wins, but both had been pegged before the season began as contenders in their respective conferences. </p> <p>The same could not be said for the Arizona Cardinals \u2013 a team widely predicted to finish in the bottom half of an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/sep/17/nfl-week-two-arizona-cardinals-tim-tebow\">NFC West division thought to be the worst in football.</a> Their schedule only rendered such a fast start all the more unthinkable. Week two brought a trip to New England: a team who had never lost a home opener at Foxboro. Week three saw them hosting Michael Vick and the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jQPAxiv1SKU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jQPAxiv1SKU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And yet after three weeks there they are, having outlasted Tom Brady's bunch last week and now overwhelmed Philadelphia. Defensive co-ordinator Ray Horton's aggressive schemes flummoxed Mike Vick \u2013 hit four times on his first seven plays and 10 times in the first half \u2013 and allowed his team to restrict the Eagles' explosive offense to six points. The Cardinals defense also forced two fumbles from the quarterback, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQPAxiv1SKU\">one of which was returned 96 yards for a touchdown</a>. All this with the Cardinals' Pro Bowl safety Adrian Wilson sitting out with ankle and groin complaints.</p> <p>Sunday brought a hugely encouraging performance from the much-maligned quarterback Kevin Kolb, completing 17 of 24 for 222 yards and two touchdowns against his former team, but there is no question that the defense remains the strength of this team. Up front Darnell Dockett and Calais Campbell create constant disruption, allowing Horton to draw up his blitz schemes around them.</p> <p>\"No one respects our defense,\" said third-year linebacker O'Brien Schofield after Sunday's win. \"No one respects our team, and that's okay.\" But as much as the Cardinals might enjoy playing the underdog, people will now begin to take notice. Seventy-five per cent of teams who start 3-0 go to the playoffs. The Cardinals' next challenge will be showing they can live with raised expectations.</p> <h2>Christian Ponder is developing nicely</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest upset of the weekend arrived in Minnesota, where the Vikings defeated the heavily favoured San Francisco 49ers 24-13. The Vikes did a lot of things right throughout the game \u2013 from forcing Alex Smith's first interception in 249 throws to restricting Frank Gore on the ground, but the stand-out performance belonged to quarterback Christian Ponder.</p> <p>Against one of the best defences in the league \u2013 one that had bewildered Matthew Stafford and defeated Aaron Rodgers in the last two weeks \u2013 Ponder kept his composure and seized the opportunities presented to him. As well as throwing for two scores, he became the first player with a rushing touchdown against the 49ers this season when he weaved through the heart of their defence to dive in from 23 yards out midway through the second quarter.</p> <p>With so much focus on the rookie quarterbacks starting this season, it has been easy to forget about the second-year guys like Ponder and Tennessee's Jake Locker \u2013 who also had a big day in his team's 44-41 overtime win over the Lions. Ponder has completed more than 70% of his passes so far this season, throwing for four touchdowns, no picks and a passer rating of 104.9.</p> <p>He's a big part of why the unfancied Vikings are now 2-1: the same record as the 49er team they beat this weekend.</p> <h2>Parity is king</h2> <p>Even before this weekend there was evidence to suggest that this was an abnormally competitive year across the NFL. A league record 20 teams reached the end of week two having won one game and lost the other. Just six teams had unbeaten records:<a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000063482/article/nfl-sets-record-with-20-teams-at-11-including-patriots\"> the lowest such figure since the NFL expanded to 30 teams in 1995</a>.</p> <p>Week three, though, only served to reinforce the point, with a string of results that would have been deemed improbable just a few short days ago. The Vikings beating the Niners? The Raiders beating the Steelers? The Chiefs wiping out an 18-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Saints in their own dome?</p> <p>Perhaps the real lesson of week three is that we don't know nearly as much as we thought we did. When even the Patriots are below .500 anything seems possible. This is the first time New England has had a losing record at any stage of a season <a href=\"http://twitter.yfrog.com/0gksagj\">since week one of 2003</a>. </p> <h2>The replacement officials saga continues to slide into farce</h2> <p>We have established by now that many of the replacement referees, drafted in to replace the regular ones after the NFL failed to reach agreement with them on a new collective contract, are not up to scratch. Over the past three weeks <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/09/16/ike-taylor-pass-interference/70000475/1#.UFaQco1mR48\">they have blown calls</a>, awarded a team <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/09/09/cardinals-hang-on-after-referee-error-helps-seattle/\">additional time-outs</a>, and at different moments just given the general impression of not being fully in control. </p> <p>This has given rise to some dangerous trends. Players, believing the new officials to be either more lenient or simply not brave enough to throw flags have begun pushing their luck \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_21577933/some-nfl-players-take-advantage-replacement-officials\">making late hits and testing the boundaries of what is acceptable</a>. Coaches have also got carried away. After Baltimore's win over New England on Sunday, Bill Belichick ran over and <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/yahoo/carousel/embed_code.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=a9ef86f4e26849eebcd00e187fe1e641\">tried to grab one of the line judges</a> as he exited the field.</p> <p>Games have become chippier. On Sunday<a href=\"https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/Letter-from-Executive-Committee-to-Owners-on-Ref-Lockout/\"> the NFL Players Association wrote an open letter to the league</a> noting, among other things, the increased injury risk in such an environment.</p> <p>Of course there is also an element of speculation to all this. The Broncos defender Joe Mays might just as well have launched himself into <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/matt-schaub-loses-piece-ear-illegal-hit-013507090--nfl.html;_ylt=AvwcHCEEJz7YrQZ8zfMLAwtYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTFkYnNvcGJsBG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDMTMEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4VGVtcA--;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">the helmet-to-helmet hit which cost Houston Texans quarterback Matt Schaub a small chunk of his ear</a> even with the most qualified officials had been in place. </p> <p>It seems rather less likely, though, that one of the regular referees would have casually thrown his hat into the path of a sprinting player, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUE3tyOZewc&amp;feature=player_embedded\">as one did during the Cowboys' win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday night</a>. Dallas wide receiver Kevin Ogletree was trying to get open in the end zone, when he lost his footing after stepping on the offending piece of headgear. </p> <p>Officials are supposed to drop their hats to the turf to signify that a player has stepped out of bounds while running a route \u2013 which would make them ineligible to catch a pass until they re-establish themselves in-bounds \u2013 but typically just beside their own feet, rather than into the path of a man running at full speed. Had Ogletree picked up a twist, sprain or worse while slipping, one can only imagine the fall-out.</p> <p>What we have also learned over the last few weeks, however, is that the NFL is unmoved by such concerns. Further talks took place between the two sides on Sunday, but<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-nfl-players-accuse-owners-of-greed-compromising-safety-20120923,0,1349648.story\"> broke off with the two sides reportedly still far apart</a>. The expectation is that we will have the replacements again for week four. Hopefully by then, someone will have had a word about the safe deployment of official headgear.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/standings\">NFL standings</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/schedules\">NFL scores and schedule</a></p>",

  "<p>The 80 million-strong Communist party of China is famously contradictory \u2013 impressively unified in its ability to maintain power, but riven with internal divisions about issues like the role of the market in China, or the function of non-state companies. A botched leadership change this autumn would cause the sort of vicious infighting that led to the collapse of other one-party systems elsewhere.</p> <p>For this reason, the current Chinese leadership, led by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao have been planning this tricky succession for many years. All looked smooth at the end of last year, but as the all-important party congress nears, the process looks increasingly shaky. The fall of key contender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a> after his wife was accused of murder and he of corruption in the spring was the start of it. The fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, heir apparent to Hu, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/15/chinese-leader-xi-jinping-appears-public\" title=\"\">disappeared from view </a>for two weeks in September further raised the temperature. In a political system as opaque and controlling as the current Chinese one, speculation becomes the sole recourse for a population \u2013 inside and outside China \u2013 which has never been hungrier for information.</p> <p>The Hu-Wen period leaves one major legacy to successors: immense growth. China's economy is now four times the size it was in 2002 when they came to power, rising from sixth to second place in global rankings, with the greatest amount of foreign reserves, and the largest levels of exports and second largest imports.</p> <p>Growth has created a number of problems however \u2013 greater inequality, environmental and energy supply problems, and a rise in visible tension in society as elites and other interest groups clash, using newly available social media or other legal means to press their case. The eruption of anger over pensions, lack of property rights, and legal redress over official malfeasance is expensive to keep under control. China now spends more on internal security than on national defence. The headache for the new leaders will be how to balance the continuing need for growth against other sociopolitical reforms that will be politically risky, but are the only way to try to create stability and balance in a society which is becoming wealthier, freer and more unruly.</p> <p>The life of elite leaders is not made any easier by the fact that China is now in an era when the tension between the officials and those they are meant to be ruling has reached fever pitch. Surveys show that central leaders just about maintain some moral credibility in society \u2013 but local leaders are regarded with large amounts of loathing. Levels of cynicism about politics in China are on a par with, or even in excess, of those in the west. Most regarded the treatment of Bo Xilai as crude political theatre, created to manoeuvre a clever communicator and a potentially threatening popular leader out of the way. The only given in the current situation is that levels of suspicion against official discourse is high, and the default of most people is disbelief. This is not a good context in which to try to undertake radical reforms.</p> <p>The new leaders have their hands tied because their macroeconomic policy is already set out in the five-year programme from 2011 to 2015. Only catastrophe would make them change this important statement of consensus. They will also be curtailed by questions about the legitimacy of how they were appointed \u2013 this is a process which has never been tried before in this way in China, and many could question it, inside and outside the party \u2013 and by the need to keep on board \"retired\" leaders who are likely to remain active behind the scenes. Their political capital will be low at the start, and it will be a hard slog trying to find easy ways to acquire it quickly.</p> <p>The post Hu and Wen leadership will have, in addition to the ally of growth, one other great helper. There is, at the moment, no alternative to the party \u2013 all effective opposition has been crushed. The party is able to present itself, under whatever leadership, as the great stabilising force, and it can wave horrifying visions of the debilitating effects of instability and disunity before a population that, for the most part, shows strong interest in getting richer and little in pushing for risky political change.</p> <p>So far, this social contract seems to be holding up. The party rules, and the people get more prosperous. But the question of how long that can continue \u2013 of what happens if the growth rate falls, or the wealth gap continues to increase \u2013 is a real and pressing one.</p> <p>For Hu and Wen, China had to grow rich and strong. For the next generation, Chinese society must grow more balanced, more just and more predictable. Achieving that will be a hard task, especially if it also involves maintaining the Communist party's utterly unique place in society.</p>",

But he did it very badly, and now he might see how a bad apology is worse than no apology at all.</p> <p>Mitchell did everything wrong. He told us that he'd already apologised, and that his apology had been accepted \u2013 which gave the impression that he thought that we, the public, should be grateful to get this extra morsel. Then he told us that he wanted this to be the end of the matter. But when you're being contrite, it's not for you to decide when your contrition should end. It's for the person, or people, you're talking to \u2013 in this case, us. Watching Mitchell, it felt as if he was trying to command us to forgive him.</p> <p>Probably the worst thing about the apology was that Mitchell, who is being accused of a minor offence and a major offence, would not address the latter at all. In apologising for the minor offence, and refusing to talk about the major offence, he conveys the impression that it's up to him to tell us what he should be apologising for. It makes him seem not sorry at all, but just sorry for himself.</p> <p>Textbook mistakes. <a href=\"http://frankpartnoy.com/\" title=\"\">Frank Partnoy</a>, a professor of law and finance at the University of California, made a study of the art of apology. Mitchell's apology comes dangerously close to resembling an apology Partnoy used to illustrate the very worst case \u2013 the \"Mel Gibson\". Remember when Gibson was arrested for drunk driving, and compounded his error with a series of sexist and racist slurs? His apology was quick and brusque. Partnoy says it's important to wait until the public has has time to \"get its anger out\". Gibson, he says, looked like \"a businessman processing a complaint against his company\". He looked as if he was trying to move on, rather than apologise.</p> <p>In his excellent book, Wait, Partnoy says there is a time to apologise quickly: when you spill a drink, or step on someone's toe. But if it's a serious matter, waiting shows respect. One problem with quick, brush-it-under-the-carpet apologies, like Mitchell's and Gibson's, is that you can sense the way they are waiting to see which way the chips will fall. Mitchell is saying sorry, but he's saying, effectively, that what he's sorry for is whatever mud may, at some future date, stick. As for now, he doesn't seem to have made up his mind as to exactly what he's sorry about.</p> <p>The right way to apologise is to wait, to acknowledge that you know what you are apologising for, to explain what you did, and not to offer excuses. That's what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer_prostitution_scandal\" title=\"\">Eliot Spitzer</a>, the New Jersey governor who was caught having trysts with prostitutes, did. He waited. He didn't duck the issue. He appeared sorry, rather than impatient. That's how you should apologise.</p> <p>Mitchell looked bad \u2013 cringe-makingly bad. He made pretty much every mistake it is possible to make. Having practically ordered us to forgive him, on his timescale, while refusing to talk about the thing he's apologising for in the first place, and yet refusing to deny it, he ends up by telling us that he must stop talking to us because he has work to do.

  "<p>A brawl involving as many as 2,000 workers forced Foxconn to close its Taiyuan plant in northern China late on Sunday, and left a number of people needing hospital treatment.</p> <p>\"The fight is over now&#xa0;\u2026 we're still investigating the cause of the fight and the number of workers involved,\" said Foxconn spokesman Louis Woo, adding it was possible it involved \"a couple of thousand workers\".</p> <p>A police statement reported by the official Xinhua news agency said 5,000 officers were dispatched to the scene.</p> <p>The violence was brought under control after about four hours and 40 people were taken to hospitals for treatment, the Taiwanese-owned company said. It said several people were detained by police.</p> <p>The violence did not appear to be work-related, the company and police said.</p> <p>Comments posted on Chinese internet bulletin boards said it might have erupted after a security guard hit an employee.</p> <p>The Taiyuan plant, which employs about 79,000 workers, makes parts for automotive electronics and assembles various electronic devices, according to Woo. Other staff sources said it makes parts for and assembles Apple's new iPhone 5, released last week.</p> <p>It was not clear how long the shutdown would last at the plant.</p> <p>Woo said the fight happened in the workers' dormitory facilities. Photographs of the incident that were posted to social networks but later deleted showed smashed windows and riot police, and crowds of workers.</p> <p>Later pictures from just outside the plant showed workers clearing shards of glass from broken windows at a building by an entrance gate and a line of olive-coloured paramilitary police trucks parked inside the factory grounds.</p> <p>Geoffrey Crothall, spokesman for the pressure group China Labor Bulletin, told the New York Times workers at the plants had become increasingly emboldened.</p> <p>\"They're more willing to stand up for their rights, to stand up to injustice,\" he said. The same plant was the subject of a brief strike over pay in March.</p> <p>Foxconn, the trading name of Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, is the world's largest contract maker of electronic goods. It has seen a few violent disputes at its sprawling plants in China, where it employs a total of about 1 million workers. It is an important supplier for companies including Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.</p> <p>Hon Hai shares were down 1.14% by late on Monday morning, lagging behind the broader market's decline of 0.28%.</p> <p>In June, about 100 workers went on a rampage at a Chengdu plant in south-west China. The company has faced allegations of poor conditions and mistreatment of workers at its Chinese operations, and has been spending heavily in recent months to raise wages and improve working conditions.</p> <p>A staff member at the Taiyuan plant said he was told the plant could be closed up to two to three days while police investigate.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of police at the site now,\" the staff member, who asked not to be named, told Reuters by telephone.</p>",
  "<p>The judge presiding over the case of Dale Cregan, the man accused of the murder of two police officers earlier this month, has warned the media, the police and politicians about the publication of material that may be prejudicial to a fair trial and of \"profound consequences\" if restraint is not exercised.</p> <p>His Honour Judge Andrew Gilbart QC made an order under the Contempt of Court Act preventing the reporting of any proceedings in the matter until after the conclusion of the trial \"or further order\".</p> <p>Gilbart's order came as Cregan, 29, made a brief appearance via videolink before Manchester crown court on Monday morning and was remanded in custody until 5 November, when he will appear via videolink at Liverpool crown court for a plea and case management hearing.</p> <p>Cregan is charged with the murders of PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, on 18 September, Mark Short, 23, in May this year, and David Short, 46, in August.</p> <p>Gilbart said: \"I make it plain that the order excludes from its restrictions the reporting of proceedings taking place before the jury at the trial. However, if there are separate trials in the case of any charges, or any defendants or defendants also charged in these cases, it will be for the trial judge to consider whether any further orders are made relating to the publication of proceedings before a jury.\"</p> <p>He went on to say: \"If proper restraint is not exercised by all concerned, then the consequences will be profound.\"</p> <p>The judge said Cregan had been sent to the crown court on 21 September charged with murder \"involving the tragic deaths of two young police officers, and the deaths of two other men, and they have attracted very widespread publicity and discussion in the media, about which this court has some considerable concern.</p> <p>\"The chief constable has, as one would expect of him, talked frankly and movingly of the force's sense of loss at the death of the two officers, and of the risks which police officers must face. I am not concerned at those very proper expressions of loss by him or by others. My concerns relate to the material which has been published and to the press conference answers and accounts, which have been widely disseminated on the internet, in broadcasts and in newspapers.\"</p> <p>He said the circumstances of the deaths of the two officers, what is said to have occurred before, and what is said to be the background to them, had also been the subject of a great deal of comment by the chief constable, and material had appeared on the Greater Manchester police website and had been reported widely. There had also been comment from politicians \"including those of the greatest seniority\", the judge added.</p> <p>\"The press and media coverage of such other material has continued since Dale Cregan was charged. For example, one of the broadsheets on my Saturday morning breakfast table published material doing more than to report the nature of the charges against him and the other defendants.\"</p> <p>He said the court was very much aware of the intense interest the public would have in what went on and why. \"The punishment of a man or woman charged with crime can only happen in a free democratic society if he is convicted after due process. It is critical to the maintenance of that due process that any defendant who denies a charge receives a fair trial, in which trial the jury must decide the case on the evidence it hears put before it in the court, presided over by a judge.\"</p> <p>He said it \"cannot and must not be decided on the basis of material published otherwise\". In serious cases, the judge added, the right to a fair trial by jury was one of our most precious civil liberties. \"Deciding what happened in these current cases, and the determination of whether or not this or these defendants or any other defendant is or are guilty of this or any other crime, is a matter for a jury to consider, and not for the press, broadcasting media, internet sites, police or politicians.\" Gilbart said the court was determined to see that the fairness of any trial was not overborne by the publication of material or comment that could affect the jury.</p> <p>He said that some of the extensive material that had been published in the press, or broadcast on the radio or television, or disseminated by the police \"has dealt with issues and evidence which may be relevant, not just to Dale Cregan's case, but also to the cases of those who were charged some weeks ago in respect of the deaths of two other men\".</p> <p>\"But I must emphasise in the strongest terms that now he has been charged, the time has come for that flow of material to cease.\"</p> <p>Due process is an important safeguard, not just for any defendant, the judge said, but also for the relatives of the victims and the public interest in seeing justice done. He said the restraint and respect for due process should extend to the presence of material on the websites of the broadcasting media, newspapers, or the police \"or indeed, anyone else\". He said the principle applied as much to whatever material or comment had been published already and was maintained in the public domain as it did to material newly published after his comments. Nothing in his remarks is intended or will have the effect of preventing reporting in accordance with the law and article 10 of the European convention on human rights.</p>",

  "<p>It is a sign of how politics has moved on from the days of Margaret Thatcher that a senior Conservative can find himself in a slanging match with the police and survive.</p> <p>In the 1980s it was irresponsible left wingers, who had no respect for law and order in the eyes of the Thatcherites, who would clash with police.</p> <p>And yet Andrew Mitchell, the man charged with ensuring discipline in the Tory ranks as chief whip, remains in his post even after admitting that he swore at police in Downing Street last week.</p> <p>There is one simple \u2013 and one deeper \u2013 reason why Mitchell has survived. In the first place David Cameron accepts that Mitchell did not call the police \"plebs\" \u2013 the most damaging allegation levelled against him by the police through the pages of the Sun.</p> <p>No 10 is nervous about voicing, even in private, the deeper reason why Mitchell is surviving. There is a feeling among some Tories that the Police Federation, which is at war with the government over cuts, is using Mitchel's confrontation with armed officers to embarrass the government.</p> <p>One Tory said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is what happens when you fiddle with police pay and conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>The prime minister has accepted Mitchell's public statement and believes he can hang on because the police officer in question has accepted his apology. Government sources believe it is the Police Federation acting as a trade union \u2013 and not the individual officer \u2013 that is fanning the row. This explains why Nick Clegg said it was \"significant\" that the police officer in question has accepted Mitchell's apology.</p> <p>Perhaps David Davis, Mitchell's original patron, is allowing himself a quiet chuckle. Davis came to loathe the Metropolitan Police during his time as shadow home secretary during the row over detention without charge. One of his supporters who was arrested by the police for doing the job of an opposition politician (Damian Green) is now police minister.</p> <p>An even older ally (Andrew Mitchell) has done what Davis would always love to do: give the police a piece of his mind.</p>",
  "<p>The president of one of the most impoverished, corrupt and mineral-rich countries on Earth has insisted he can turn it into a stable democracy and economic powerhouse, declaring: \"I will be both the Mandela and the Obama of Guinea.\"</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Alpha Cond\u00e9 said Guinea had left behind half a century of military coups and despotic regimes and was on an \"irreversible\" march to democracy. He sought to assure investors that a country boasting the second biggest mining reserves in Africa and fifth biggest in the world, potentially worth $222bn (\u00a3137bn), was open for business.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9, 74, has enlisted Tony Blair and George Soros as advisers and was granted an audience with Obama at the White House. But sceptics question his treatment of political opponents and his ability to root out graft and keep a fragile peace.</p> <p>Since independence from France in 1958, the west African nation has endured a series of autocrats and reached a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/29/guinea-massacre-stadium-protest\" title=\"\">nadir in September 2009</a> when security forces massacred more than 150 people and raped dozens of women at an opposition rally.</p> <p>Three months later, the leader of the military junta was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/guinea-accuses-france-camara-shooting\" title=\"\">shot in the head</a> \u2013 he survived, but fled the country.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/18/guinea-military-state-of-emergency?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">won the country's first democratic election</a> in 2010, the reward for long decades resisting tyranny from exile and jail. \"I will be Mandela for what he did for freedom fighting and Obama for what he's done for hope,\" he told the Guardian in his first British press interview since coming to power, a Mandela \"46664\" <a href=\"http://www.46664.com\" title=\"\">charity silver bracelet</a> on his right wrist.</p> <p>\"I'm a man of conviction, I have strong convictions. I also know that being in the opposition in Africa probably will require one to go to prison, so I had accepted that already.</p> <p>\"I had a clear goal: my goal was to change the situation in my country. I was hoping that this would lead to the presidency, as this would enable me to do so, but that wasn't the important part. The ideal of the conviction was what drove me. The outcome, I couldn't tell while I was in the struggle. It was sticking to my objective and my course.\"</p> <p>Today the sports stadium that witnessed the 2009 massacre appears unremarkable, with football-shirted students strolling by and a young trumpeter leading a band of musicians. But hot and humid Conakry is a capital city of dilapidated buildings, potholed roads and erratic power and water supplies. More than half of Guinea's population lives in poverty and 70% are illiterate. It ranks near the bottom of global corruption, development and governance indices.</p> <p>Last year, Cond\u00e9 himself was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/19/guinea-president-survives-assassination-attempt\" title=\"\">targeted by assassins</a> who fired a rocket-propelled grenade into his compound, killing a bodyguard and raising questions over whether civilian rule could last. \"It's been 50 years so change will require some time,\" he said. \"We believe it is irreversible but it will require time.</p> <p>\"One must understand that changing mentalities and changing mindsets are very difficult. The challenges are many and there are many obstacles to change: there were many who benefited from the former system and will therefore resist the change process that we believe is irreversible because the youth wants it. We are looking to the youth.\"</p> <p>The prospect of an end to the chaos has triggered a scramble for Guinea's vast mineral reserves. It is the world's largest producer of bauxite, used to make aluminium, and boasts vast iron ore deposits as well as diamonds, gold and uranium. Rio Tinto, Vale and the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) are among the mining giants competing fiercely.</p> <p>How to carve up the cake, and learn lessons from the past by ducking the \"resource curse\" that has wreaked poverty and conflict on many countries, was the central theme of the recent Guinea economic forum that included ministers, investors, the British ambassador, the World Bank, the IMF, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford University economist Paul Collier. The Guardian's attendance was funded by the UNDP.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72100X20110302?sp=true\" title=\"\">turned to the billionaire investor Soros</a> to help draw up a mining code that would reduce corruption and increase the government's stake from 15% to 35%.</p> <p>He said the World Bank had granted Guinea $20m (\u00a312.3m) to hire banks and lawyers and set up technical and strategic committees to oversee the process. \"We need to start engaging on an even footing with the mining companies. We still have much to do in terms of anti-corruption but we feel we have reached some important milestones already.\"</p> <p>The president is also receiving support from Blair, whose charity the <a href=\"http://www.africagovernance.org\" title=\"\">Africa Governance Initiative</a> has deployed advisers to Conakry to help instil sound leadership and attract foreign investment. Blair's office has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/9136126/Tony-Blair-expands-his-African-empire-into-mineral-rich-Guinea.html\" title=\"\">denied that he has any commercial interest in Guinea</a>.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 said: \"Mr Blair is helping the country in capacity building. We are the first francophone country he has come into. He has learned from his experience at Downing Street that it is not enough for a leader to have a vision; the centre of power should also be concentrated around the leader so he can empower himself to bring about his vision.\"</p> <p>The president's vision is under scrutiny, however. A year ago three protesters were killed during clashes between police and demonstrators at a banned opposition rally. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/guinea-urged-investigate-opposition-protest-deaths-2011-09-28\" title=\"\">Amnesty International warned</a>: \"It's deeply alarming that President Alpha Cond\u00e9 is resorting to exactly the same brutal methods as his predecessors.\"</p> <p>In July, Cond\u00e9's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/08/us-guinea-mine-protest-idUSBRE8770VV20120808\" title=\"\">security forces clashed with villagers</a> demanding jobs in the village of Zogota, where Vale and the Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz's BSG Resources are jointly seeking to develop an iron ore mine. Local rights groups claimed five protesters were killed, while the government has launched an investigation.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9, who is bound by the constitution to serve no more than two terms, denies that he will join the African hall of infamy as a liberator turned tyrant. \"Maybe, unlike others, I took 50 years to get to power,\" he said. \"I'm not a young man any more, or a 30-year-old, so I've reached a stage of maturity.</p> <p>\"When I was in prison, tremendous support arose throughout Africa and I feel I have a challenge to show the youth who believed in me then that I can bring about a new leadership for Africa \u2013 a leadership based on good governance, the respect of democratic freedom. It's very important for me to live up to that expectation.\"</p> <p>Political opponents, however, accuse Cond\u00e9 of stoking ethnic tensions and excluding them from the new Guinea. Parliamentary elections have been delayed by wrangling.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9's centralisation of power has raised eyebrows abroad. <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/ousmane-diagana\" title=\"\">Ousmane Diagana</a>, the World Bank's country director, said: \"He delivered on economic reforms but I think on the political aspect he is relatively slow when we take into consideration the type of new consensus that needs to be built around governance based on stronger political institutions.</p> <p>\"I think they need to have a frank debate. Guineans need to be around the same table to discuss the political agenda and how it can actually support the economic transformation.\"</p> <p>Diagana added: \"We're hoping the president is the right person to do that given his background and trajectory, but the fact this conversation is not taking place between the opposition and the government in charge is worrying.\"</p> <p>The scale of the challenge facing Cond\u00e9, and Guinea, just two years into democracy is daunting. There was a timely reality check from Donald Kaberuka, the president of the <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org\" title=\"\">African Development Bank</a>. \"Guinea has wasted too much time,\" he told the forum. \"At the time when the rest of Africa is moving on, this is time for Guinea and Guineans to come together through strong political institutions, to come together through transparent economic governance. The hard work begins now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Health experts are trying to identify a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\" title=\"\">Sars-like</a> virus that is so far known to have infected two people, one of whom is receiving intensive care in a London hospital.</p> <p>A 49-year-old Qatari man was transported by air ambulance from Doha almost two weeks ago. The other person, a 60-year-old man, died in Saudi Arabia, where the Qatari had recently travelled before falling ill.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Health Protection Agency (HPA)</a> is drawing up advice to help healthcare workers recognise in others the symptoms that occurred in the two men. These include fever, cough, shortness of breath and other breathing difficulties.</p> <p>It is not clear at present whether the two confirmed cases are typical or the virus could be circulating more widely, but only rarely causing severe illness. John Watson, head of respiratory diseases at the HPA, said: \"The HPA is providing advice to healthcare workers to ensure the patient under investigation is being treated appropriately.</p> <p>\"In the light of the severity of the illness that has been identified in the two confirmed cases, immediate steps have been taken to ensure that people who have been in contact with the UK case have not been infected, and there is no evidence to suggest they have.\"</p> <p>Watson said information was also being prepared to help increase vigilance. This was being shared with national and international authorities including the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Control.</p> <p>\"As we are aware of only two cases worldwide and there is no evidence of ongoing transmission, at present there is no specific action for the public or returning travellers to take but we will share any further advice with the public as soon as more information becomes available.\"</p> <p>The HPA said it was aware of a small number of other cases of people with a serious respiratory illness in the Middle East in the past three months, one of whom had been treated in the UK, but had since died. This person's illness was also being investigated but there was no evidence it had been caused by the same virus or that it was linked to the two confirmed cases.</p> <p>The WHO said the man now in London had been admitted to intensive care in Doha, Qatar, on 7 September and flown to London on 11 September. He had also suffered renal failure. Officials will also be concerned that the hajj pilgrimage next month \u2013 which will be attended by thousands of Muslims from around the world \u2013 might provide an opportunity for the virus to spread to other countries.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004460/\" title=\"\">Sars crisis of 2003</a>, which seems to have started in southern China the previous year but was not identified as a serious problem until an outbreak in Vietnam, quickly become a multicountry epidemic. There were an estimated 8,000 cases, including some in the UK, and 750 deaths.</p> <p>The new virus is a type of coronavirus. These are causes of the common cold but can be responsible for far more serious illness. The new virus is different from any previously identified, the HPA says. Preliminary inquiries are said to have revealed no evidence of illness in contacts of the two cases, including healthcare workers. The agency said that based on previous knowledge of coronaviruses, many of the contacts would already have passed the period when they could have caught the virus from one of the infected people.</p> <p>Peter Openshaw, director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, said: \"For now, we need to be watchful: any evidence of human to human transmission causing severe disease would be very worrying and would raise the spectre of a new Sars-like outbreak.</p> <p>\"The hope for now is that these cases are just highly unusual presentations of a generally mild infection, and that viral surveillance and detection is now so good that we are picking up cases that would not have been found in previous times.\"</p>",
  "<p>Three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in Benghazi, Libya, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/22/world/africa/libya-ambassador-journal/index.html\">CNN found</a> a seven-page handwritten journal he had written. That journal, found on the floor of what CNN called \"the largely unsecured consulate compound where he was fatally wounded\", contained obviously newsworthy information: specifically that \"in the months leading up to his death, the late ambassador worried about what he called the security threats in Benghazi and a rise in Islamic extremism\". CNN <a href=\"http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/20/source-slain-ambassador-stevens-worried-about-security-threats-in-libya/\"> also reported</a> that Stevens \"mentioned his name was on an al Qaeda hit list\".</p> <p>After finding the journal, CNN personnel did the only thing which any minimally competent journalist would and should do: they read it, identified the parts that were in the public interest, confirmed their authenticity with independent sources, and then reported those facts to the world. They also notified Stevens' family of what they had found.</p> <p>In response to this reporting, State Department spokesman Philippe Reines issued <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/cnn-christopher-stevens-journal-state-dept-response_n_1906609.html\">a blistering, unusually aggressive attack</a> on the news network. Denouncing CNN's conduct as \"disgusting\", Reines invoked Stevens' family to insist that CNN had done something unconscionable:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What they're not owning up to is reading and transcribing Chris's diary well before bothering to tell the family or anyone else that they took it from the site of the attack. Or that when they finally did tell them, they completely ignored the wishes of the family, and ultimately broke their pledge made to them only hours after they witnessed the return to the United States of Chris's remains.</p> <p>\"Whose first instinct is to remove from a crime scene the diary of a man killed along with three other Americans serving our country, read it, transcribe it, email it around your newsroom for others to read, and only when their curiosity is fully satisfied thinks to call the family or notify the authorities?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer to that question is: any journalist worthy of the name. CNN's first obligation is to disclose to the public information that is newsworthy, not conceal it. Had they not reported this information, that would have been an inexcusable breach of their obligation - <em>then</em> the word \"disgusting\" would have been appropriate. What they reported had nothing to do with Stevens' personal life and everything to do with his role as a government official; his family's \"permission\" was therefore irrelevant.</p> <p>(At least a few Democratic Party loyalists have dutifully joined in the State Department's attack on CNN. One of Nancy Pelosi's daughters, Christine - yet another in the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/11/14/americas_meritocratic_watchdog_news_media/\">endless stream of televised pundits</a> who is given a public platform due to a politically famous parent in a nation that claims to loathe aristocracy - <a href=\"http://johnnydollar.us/files/120922geraldo.php\">went on Fox News this weekend and denounced CNN</a> as \"outrageous\" and demanded that \"they absolutely ought to be stopped\", whatever that might mean.)</p> <p>What is actually \"disgusting\" here is that the State Department is exploiting the grief of Chris Stevens' family in an attempt to suppress and delegitimize reporting that reflects quite poorly on them. As Michael Hastings <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/libya-threatens-clintons-legacy-and-stat\">documented yesterday</a>, the State Department views the revelations from Stevens' journal as threatening to Hillary Clinton's reputation, the legacy of the war in Libya, and possibly Obama's political prospects in an election year:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The blockbuster news contradicted the line the State Department and the administration had been pushing since the horrible tragedy took place almost two weeks ago: that there was no intelligence of a coming attack. In fact, the Ambassador himself was aware of a persistent high level threat against him.</p> <p>\"'Perhaps the real question here,' CNN responded to the State Department criticism, 'Is why is the State Department now attacking the messenger.'</p> <p>\"That is the real question, and State Department's bizarre criticism of CNN gives clues to the answer. Foggy Bottom is now in full-on damage control mode, with the primary goal of keeping Hillary Clinton's legacy in Libya - and in Washington - intact.</p> <p>\"The election-year focus on President Barack Obama meant that the White House had at first been catching most of the heat for the tragedy in Benghazi. It's certainly true the explanations from White House spokesman Jay Carney and UN Ambassador Susan Rice have strained common sense - mainly, the idea that the attack could be blamed solely on an anti-Islamic video, and that there was a protest outside the consulate at 10 p.m. (there reportedly wasn't,) among other misleading details. That initial story has crumbled . . . </p> <p>\"But in reality, the fiasco appears to be largely - if not entirely - a State Department botch. It was the State Department that failed to provide its ambassador adequate security; it was the State Department that fled Benghazi in the aftermath of the attack, apparently failing to clear or secure the scene, leaving Stevens' diary behind; and it was State that had taken the lead on the ground after the Libya intervention.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not particularly impressed with the criticism that the Obama administration should have better secured the consulate. It is always easy retroactively to demand greater security when an attack occurs, and it is impossible to safeguard against all potential threats. Nonetheless, that is a criticism that is being widely voiced, rendering Stevens' journal clearly relevant and newsworthy. If a US ambassador is murdered, the fact that he spent months worrying about his security is obviously something the public should know.</p> <p>But the more relevant impact is how this reflects on the war in Libya, flamboyantly celebrated as a grand success by Washington consensus and then all but forgotten. Stevens' journal is but the latest in a long line of evidence demonstrating how much extreme instability, lawlessness and violence is <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/libya-rule-of-law-or-rule-of-militias\">plaguing that country</a> in the aftermath of the intervention. Wrote Hastings: \"As one senior U.S. government official who'd visited Libya told me earlier this summer: 'It's not Iraq, but it's not good, either.'\"</p> <p>Along those lines, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/world/africa/attack-in-libya-was-major-blow-to-cia-efforts.html?hp\">reported today</a> that the killing of Stevens and the evacuation of all Americans from Benghazi both exposed and disrupted a far larger CIA contingent (\"operatives and contractors\") in the city than was previously known - even by Libya's supposedly sovereign government. That the US exploited its \"humanitarian intervention\" to establish a substantial covert CIA beachhead is the opposite of surprising. Those operatives, among other things, worked on \"tracking shoulder-fired missiles taken from the former arsenals of\" Gadaffis' forces and \"aided in efforts to secure Libya's chemical weapons stockpiles\".</p> <p>Yet again, western military intervention spawns vast instability and leads to the proliferation of weapons into the hands of extremists deeply hostile to the US. As Jonathan Schwarz, referring to the US support of the pre-Al-Qaeda mujahdeen in Afghanistan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tinyrevolution/status/245893850340671488\">sardonically noted</a> in the aftermath of the 11 September Benghazi attack: \"with practice and better technology, we've really cut down the turnaround time between arming Islamists and them killing Americans on 9/11.\"</p> <p>We see this over and over and yet never learn the lesson. The New York Times editorial page today <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/opinion/on-the-wrong-side.html?hp\">declared the Iraqi government</a> \"on the wrong side\" by virtue of its alignment with Iran and Syria and suggested that US aid - only a fraction of what is necessary to rebuild that country after the US destroyed it - should be cut off if such insolence continues. US-enabled regime change, time and again, exacerbates the very problems it is ostensibly intended to resolve. </p> <p>If the Iraqi government continues to side with Iran, how much longer will it be before calls for regime change in Iraq are renewed? And how much longer will it be before we hear that <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/US-sends-Marines-to-Libya-after-deadly-attack-3860770.php\">military intervention in Libya</a> is (again) necessary, this time to control the anti-US extremists who are now armed and empowered by virtue of the first intervention? US military interventions are most adept at ensuring that future US military interventions will always be necessary.</p> <p>It is no wonder, then, that the State Department is so infuriated that CNN reported the serious concerns expressed by Ambassador Stevens. Those journal entries further impugn the US government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/obama-officials-spin-benghazi-attack\">now discredited story</a> about the Benghazi attack, and further underscore the profound instability and danger in Libya in the wake of that intervention. Feigned concerns over the sensitivities of the Stevens family notwithstanding, that is exactly why the Obama administration and its loyalists are so incensed by CNN's reporting, and it is exactly why CNN had not only the right, but also the duty, to report this.</p>",

The Psycho in question is actually the nom-du-rap of South Korean Park Jae-sang (\"Psy\" for short) who is quickly becoming South Korea's most successful export ever. Since the song was released in July, Psy's been signed by Justin Bieber's management, performed on Ellen, and collaborated with Jill Stuart on a Gangnam-inspired fashion line. Even Samsung is trying to cash in on Psy's success, making him the new <a href=\"http://www.allkpop.com/2012/09/psy-and-lee-seung-gis-cf-for-samsungs-new-model-of-kimchi-refrigerator-revealed\" title=\"\">endorsement model </a>for its range of kimchi refrigerators.</p> <p>That Psy is promoting upmarket frocks and luxury fridges is somewhat ironic, considering Gangnam Style's lampooning of the rampant consumerism that pervades what has been described as South Korea's Beverly Hills. The song's lyrics, for example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang_Girl\" title=\"\">poke fun at soybean-paste girls</a> who eat cheaply in private so that they can afford to drink mocha frappe lattes in public. Of course, this social commentary is largely lost on non-Korean speakers who don't know their kimchi from their Kim Lee; it's hardly Gangnam Style's political message that is behind its success in the west. So what is? How on Earth has the song become so popular, when, as one <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/gangnam-style-dissected-the-subversive-message-within-south-koreas-music-video-sensation/261462/\" title=\"\">CNN anchor blithely notes</a>, no one has any idea what Psy is rapping about?</p> <p>Well, there's the fact that Gangnam Style is ridiculously catchy, but that alone doesn't explain the song's meteoric rise. Essentially, it is just an over-the-top video where a fat man does a comical dance and sings repetitive lyrics that don't make sense to most of us. Which basically describes every <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flo_Rida\" title=\"\">Flo Rida</a> song ever. This is partly the point of the video, which parodies not just cultural mores specific to South Korea, but cultural excesses easily recognisable to western viewers. Gangnam Style's lyrics may be in Korean, but its visuals are in clear American. It is a pastiche of pop video cliches so familiar you almost feel you know what Psy is singing.</p> <p>The video also contains the seeds of its own reconstruction \u2013 which goes a long way to explain its success. The dance moves are simple enough to mimic and easily copied scenarios \u2013 such as the elevator scene \u2013 call out to be aped. Psy has produced a video that is born to spawn and has further facilitated this by waiving his copyright. This stands in high contrast to many western hip-hop stars who have been slow to relinquish control of their \"intellectual\" property in the same way (take Jay-Z's Empire State of Mind, for example, which quickly generated a host of YouTube tributes that were quickly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/10925414\" title=\"\">removed by EMI</a>).</p> <p>Psy's relaxed attitude to his tributes has meant that Gangnam Style has already enjoyed a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gangnam-style-parody-videos-gandalf-my-little-pony-wedding-el-monte-373095\" title=\"\">prolific after-life</a>. Everyone has made their own version, which only adds to the success of the original. Nevertheless, I can't help thinking that there is a slightly odd dynamic at work in this mimicry. For one thing, Gangnam Style is itself a parody. If a spoof spoofs a spoof then what's that spoof spoofing? What, exactly, is the source of all that hilarity?</p> <p>The last time the west laughed so uproariously at a Korean singer was when an animated Kim Jong-il bewailed how <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEaKX9YYHiQ\" title=\"\">\"ronery\"</a> he was in the film Team America, and how nobody took him \"serirousry\". The puppet had a point: popular western media doesn't tend to take east Asian men seriously \u2013 even when they're brutal dictators. The stereotype of a portly, non-threatening Charlie Chan-type who speaks \"comical\" English is still very much alive, apparent in everything from <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/slideshows/02af4e01b0/10-funniest-examples-of-the-hungry-kim-jong-un-meme\" title=\"\">hungry Kim Jong-un</a> memes to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1938914.stm\" title=\"\">Abercrombie and Fitch T-shirts</a>. And it's hard to escape the uncomfortable feeling that this stereotype is contributing something to the laughter around Gangnam Style.</p>",

She writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What's happening in Brighton is clear enough. The Lib Dems think of themselves as essentially a centre-left party, and are wallowing in the fantasy of presenting themselves as progressive politicians, ready to squeeze the rich and green the nation. The trouble is, in a few days' time, they make the short journey back north to Westminster \u2013 where they return to a centre-right government run by people who share none of these views.<br>The Lib Dem fantasy is to concentrate on the one-day, might-be coalition with Labour they'd prefer, and policies they'd follow then. Who knows? It could happen. But meanwhile, by far the likeliest outcome of this posturing is that Clegg's new red lines on tax will simply mean minimal planning by the government on fiscal policy generally. He can stop Osborne making deeper welfare cuts \u2013 that's useful, and worth it \u2013 while Osborne can end his hopes of further taxes on the rich. It will be economic stalemate, very like the constitutional stalemate that followed the frustrating of Lords reform and boundary changes.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Andrew Sparrow's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live\">politics live blog</a> will be covering all the day's events, and you can see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-democrat-conference-2012\">the Guardian's full conference coverage here</a></p> <p>\u2022 More evidence of the distress being caused by the government's <strong>welfare reforms</strong>.

Campaigners have argued for quite some time that assessing such people regularly would be a greater waste of Government time and public money than simply providing them with the benefits to which they are certainly and genuinely entitled.<br>This is without taking into consideration the unnecessary emotional stress that assessments would cause to the disabled person and their carers.<br>It is now to be hoped that David Cameron and all relevant Government Ministers are made aware of this case as soon as possible.

He writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... borrowing, amongst other things, brought the Labour government down. The Tories said we had to stop it because it was putting a millstone round the neck of future generations. They have used it as an excuse to cut public services, privatise the NHS, place a debt burden on all students for generations to come by massively increasing student fees and so loans (even though they claim that this is a disaster if applied to the country as a whole) and to slash beenfits and pensions. And the process has only just begun: 80% of the cuts have yet to happen.<br>They said they had to do this to keep the markets happy. They said interest rates would sky-rocket if they did not cut. They said we'd be like Greece. They said our economy would collapse. Well, we might be in recession but none of those things have happened.

But it's the police who seem to be making politics of it. What exactly do they want the chief whip to do in the age of reality TV? Disembowel himself on the Six O'Clock News?</p> <p>It was inevitable that the Labour party would try to exploit Mitchell's naff misconduct because it handily reinforces the opposition's campaign to paint the Tories as a bunch of arrogant, out-of-touch toffs. Plenty of Tory MPs and activists will have been horrified by what he did. But Labour is being no more short-sighted in heaping damage on the reputation of the political class than the Cameroons would have been before 2010.</p> <p>It is not as if the Sun or other newspapers and pundits spluttering with exaggerated outrage over the chief whip's oikish conduct are in any position to deliver lectures on good manners when they display a distinct lack of them every day. Many dislike Mitchell, nor because he is a well-off public school insider, but because he also presided over the coalition's dramatic expansion of Britain's overseas aid budget.</p> <p>All the rightwing newspapers are busy campaigning to end its ring-fenced status \u2013 along with the NHS part of David Cameron's detox strategy before 2010 \u2013 and scoring some hits amid the malicious distortions. Yes, the EU aid budget to which we contribute is of doubtful effectiveness (even the Sunday Telegraph conceded Britain's is much better targeted) and the baronial middlemen do best out of the system. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9560095/Welcome-to-the-world-of-aid-funded-business.html\" title=\"\">Sunday Tel caught them</a> boasting about conference beaches at a private session last week. Oh dear.</p> <p>But the Police Federation has chosen to turn the incident into a political affair too and that is more disturbing. The coincidence that made Mitchell's offence worse, the double murder of two officers in Manchester, does not provide an excuse to embarrass a government with which the police at all levels are in an industrial dispute about pay, terms and conditions.</p> <p>Fleet Street would not rush to support the RMT's Bob Crow if he pulled such a stunt. Nor should it now. The government's reforms are probably too sweeping and too fast, but reform of the police is overdue in many respects \u2013 as noted here. Public confidence in them has fallen too.</p> <p>Yet someone in the force has been leaking disputed material \u2013 the police version of what Andrew Mitchell said \u2013 to the newspapers again; material arising from part of the Metropolitan force's day job, which is to protect members of the Queen's duly elected government working in Whitehall. After the Hillsborough debacle, after two royal photo scandals in the past month and much else you'd think they'd have learned. But they haven't.</p> <p>On BBC TV's Dateline London at the weekend I heard an Indian journalist say this sort of overbearing treatment of public officials by a powerful politician is common in developing countries, but not in countries like Britain. I bet it happens in France, but I have seen politicians, important ones too, bossed around by officious cops in the US \u2013 and suffer it without a murmur. I once saw John Major endure a conference security check (body searched as I recall) without complaint. Bless him, he was chancellor of the exchequer at the time.</p> <p>The alarming sub-plot here is that Sir Brian Leveson, the judge charged with investigating the police/politics/media triangle, must be watching all this on the news channels as he writes his report on how best to regulate the press. Lord Justice Leveson is clearly a decent man, but what I have seen suggests he may be out of his depth.</p> <p>At his party's Brighton conference yesterday Nick Clegg said he hopes Leveson's report will be implemented. But in a largely unreported passage he also said he would prefer a \"raucous and rude press to a tame and insipid press.\" Quite right too. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-nick-clegg-video\" title=\"\">He has been more cautious about Mitchell</a>. Right again.</p> <p>But the coppers and the tabloids \u2013 which fell out over the Hillsborough findings \u2013 play a dangerous game when they join forces to gang up against the politicians on a relatively trivial matter (dissing a duty policeman is not exactly corruption or a mass phone hacking cover-up). MPs are currently well placed to exact significant penalties for misconduct from both press and police. But all three can damage each other. Best to de-escalate, I'd say.</p>",
  "<p>Games company King.com's roots are in casual skill-games, where players could compete for cash and prizes as well as for fun. However, its recent growth has come from Facebook, without the prizes but with social features. Mobile is its next frontier.</p> <p>In the last couple of years, King.com has grown from being the 40th most popular games developer on Facebook to second place behind Zynga, with 49.6m monthly active users (MAUs) and 11.9m daily active users (DAUs) <a href=\"http://appdata.com/devs/33501-king-com\">at the time of writing</a>.</p> <p>\"Just as we could see the Facebook games audience growing two years ago, the mobile games audience is now growing as well,\" says Alex Dale, chief marketing officer at King.com. \"Delivering casual social games on mobile is absolutely something we're focused on.\"</p> <p>The first fruits of this strategy came with the launch of <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bubble-witch-saga/id526656012?mt=8\">Bubble Witch Saga for iOS</a> in July 2012, which synchronises players' progress with the Facebook version so they can continue their game across devices.</p> <p>Is the game doing well? King.com isn't giving figures, although the App Store charts reveal that Bubble Witch Saga is the 131st Top Grossing iPhone app in the US, but 28th in the UK. These chart positions don't tell the whole story \u2013&nbsp;people playing heavily on their iPhones or iPads may well be spending money within the Facebook version of the game.</p> <p>It does show that King.com's challengers on mobile go well beyond Zynga, though, with freemium games by independent developers like Supercell (Clash of Clans, Hay Day), Kabam (Kingdoms of Camelot), NaturalMotion (CSR Racing) and Backflip Studios (DragonVale) all riding high on the App Store.</p> <p>Dale hopes that King.com's focus on casual social games will bring it mobile success comparable to its growth on Facebook, particularly in the UK, where he points to research by the Internet Advertising Bureau claiming that 80% of the adult population consider themselves to be gamers.</p> <p>\"It's now so mainstream, with one thing that has made it mainstream being Facebook in terms of bringing a female audience into gaming, and then mobile bringing an adult audience,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Both of those groups are looking for something easy to pick up and play, which doesn't require hours of practice or a whole load of grinding for cities, castles or farms. They want something quick and puzzle-oriented. That trend has been behind the growth of King.com on Facebook, and obviously the mobile versions of these games play to the same background.\"</p> <p>So what next, following Bubble Witch Saga? King.com has a healthy pipeline of games thanks to its main website, which maintains a constantly-refreshed roster of 150 games. Dale says that the ones that are most popular will be considered for rebuilding as \"Saga\" games for Facebook, with additional content and social features.</p> <p>\"Hopefully they'll grow a happy and engaged audience on Facebook, and then once they've done that, we've got an audience that we can help to launch the game on mobile,\" he says. Which suggests Candy Crush Saga \u2013 15.1m MAUs on Facebook \u2013 may be heading mobile-wards in the coming months.</p> <p>Dale praises Facebook's mobile efforts for app discovery, which are pointing more of its 543m active mobile users to native apps for their iOS and Android devices from within their newsfeeds. \"It's a hugely valuable discovery mechanism,\" he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, King.com is exploring ways to make money on mobile beyond pure in-app purchases, although Dale says the company isn't currently looking to bring the skill-gaming model across from its original business.</p> <p>Instead, King.com is trying its \"incentivised video\" ads on mobile devices, which offer gameplay boosts such as extra lives in return for watching a video ad. Dale says it's also looking at brand promotions \"where a brand might sponsor boosters or elements of the gameplay\".</p> <p>The company is also considering its strategy for taking games to Android devices, with Bubble Witch Saga already available in the US for Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet. King.com has also dipped its toes in the waters of web-apps, making an HTML5 version of its Pyramid Solitaire Saga game.</p> <p>Still, the company's focus remains on mainstream players. \"The Facebook games audience has broadened away from a very-strongly resource management-oriented audience to something that's mainstream and interested in casual games,\" says Dale.</p> <p>\"If you look at some of the all-time top-performing games on iPhone and iPad, starting with Angry Birds, you find that they are casual formats as well. And mobile is one of the fastest-growing areas by revenue for the games industry as a whole.\"</p>",
  "<h2>12pm Hamilton gets go-ahead for Monday's meeting</h2> <p><strong>Tony Paley:</strong> Monday afternoon's meeting at Hamilton has been given the go-ahead after the track passed a second inspection just before midday.</p> <p>Clerk of the course Hazel Peplinski had an initial look at 7am but felt it prudent to check again at 11.45am in light of forecast rain.</p> <p>However, she was able to give the meeting the go-ahead with the ground described as heavy. Peplinski tweeted: \"Second precautionary inspection passed [at] Hamilton Park.\"</p> <h2>Monday's best bets, by Greg Wood</h2> <p>The card at Hamilton this afternoon still hangs in the balance with a further inspection planned for 11.45, The going at the Scottish track is already heavy and, while it was described as raceable after an inspection earlier this morning, any further rain, of which there is plenty about, could be enough to wipe it out.</p> <p>The meetings at Leicester is one to treat with caution too, due to the amount of rain which has arrived since the entries were made. The going is currently described as good, but with heavy rain forecast, and quite a few trainers seem to have decided that it is not worth the effort, with over 20 of Saturday's original declarations now non-runners.</p> <p>Of those that remain, <strong>Silvanus (4.00) </strong>is a fair price for the sprint handicap, particularly if more rain gets into the ground over the next few hours, but Kempton's eight-race card on the all-weather is probably a more dependable place to play.</p> <p>Blue promises to be the colour over the first half of the card, as Godolphin's two trainers, Saeed bin Suroor and Mahmood al-Zarooni, have fair prospects of carving up the first four races.</p> <p><strong>Mar Mar (3.20)</strong> will be hard to beat, while in the most valuable race of the day, Sylvester Kirk's progressive <strong>Dark Castle (4.20)</strong>, a good second to another improving horse over course and distance last time, is worth backing to beat the likely favourite, Intransigent.

  "<p>Data-driven marketing is booming. According to the findings of the DMA's inaugural <a href=\"http://www.dma.org.uk/toolkit/putting-price-direct-marketing\" title=\"\">Putting a price on direct marketing study</a>, UK businesses spent \u00a314.2bn on direct marketing in 2011 and forecast their expenditure to increase by 7% in 2012 to nearly \u00a315.2bn. The lion's share of growth can be attributed to increased expenditure on digital marketing. This year, companies expect to increase their investment in email marketing by 12% to \u00a32.5bn and social media marketing expenditure will rise by 8% to \u00a32.2bn.</p> <p>The DMA's report also reveals that companies attribute a massive 23% of total sales to direct marketing, and that the industry directly and indirectly supports 530,000 jobs. In spite of its significant contribution to the flagging UK economy, a severe threat to the long-term future of direct marketing looms on the horizon.</p> <p>In January of this year, the EU announced its new draft <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fjustice%2Fdata-protection%2Fdocument%2Freview2012%2Fcom_2012_11_en.pdf&amp;ei=mCZgUPHcJpKFhQfBloHIBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtks6MyKe5X0GWIghrB6xfF3g8wA&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Data Protection Regulation (pdf)</a> intended to bring legislation in line with the demands of the 21st century. The current European data protection legislation was conceived nearly 20 years ago at a time when the idea of smartphones and internet access in every household was the stuff of Tomorrow's World. As a result, the legislation is no longer fit for purpose, unable to represent the realities of a world in which data has become a primary currency exchanged between consumers, businesses and organisations.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as it currently stands the draft regulation fails to strike the right balance between protecting individuals' rights to data privacy and preserving the commercial freedoms of companies to engage with consumers. On a practical level, the regulation would stifle data-driven marketing in three ways:</p> <h2>1. Opt-in/opt-out and obtaining consent</h2> <p>The new regulation doesn't go as far as heralding an opt-in only regime for data-driven marketing \u2013 but it comes close. The current proposal demands that companies would have to obtain explicit consent from consumers by \"clear statement or affirmative action\" to use their data for marketing purposes. While companies wouldn't necessarily have to get consumers to tick an opt-in box, they won't be able to take for granted that consumers consent to receiving marketing information \u2013 even if they have had previous interaction with them.</p> <p>The worst-case scenario is that companies that fail to prove they have properly obtained consent from individuals to contact them with direct marketing messages would have to scrap their contact databases and find it difficult to build them back up again.</p> <h2>IP addresses</h2> <p>Under the new regulation, IP addresses are classed as personal data. This would result in web analytics no longer being available to companies. Even though they look at the online activities of anonymised batches of IP addresses, the information itself would be considered personal data and hence off-limits. The ramifications of this are huge for digital marketers as they would no longer be able to chart the journey consumers take from communication to action, or analyse their behaviour online.</p> <p>Classifying IP addresses as personal data would also overlap with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/sep/07/eu-cookie-law-directive-digital-marketing?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">new cookies regulations</a>. Doing so would damage user experience of websites. Their preferences wouldn't be stored, which would deny visitors a personalised experience and they would have the inconvenience of uploading their details with every repeat transaction. These two effects would inflict incalculable damage on sales.</p> <h2>The right to be forgotten</h2> <p>The new regulation would give individuals the right to request companies to delete any information that they hold on them. This has been designed specifically to enable people to delete their social media accounts. This requirement would certainly stifle innovation for social media companies, but consequences of the right to be forgotten reach beyond social media platforms.</p> <p>So what now? If the draft EU Data Protection Regulation were to be implemented tomorrow, the consequences for the UK economy would be dire. According to the businesses polled for our direct marketing study, the average cost per company through lost sales and additional costs caused by the regulation could potentially reach \u00a376,000, or \u00a347bn for UK plc.</p> <p>The overly-prescriptive regulation also threatens to deny people the choice of how they use their data. According to research conducted by the DMA, 85% of consumers would prefer to hold their own personal data and exchange it with companies when they choose. Indeed, more and more consumers view their personal data as a form of capital to be collected and traded for better services, offers and long-term benefits. For example, nearly nine in 10 people now use one or more store loyalty card.</p> <p>The new regulation, which is soon to start its long passage through the European parliament, must be drafted in a way to reflect the realities of how companies use data to drive sales and how consumers really perceive data privacy. Failure to do so would come at an unacceptably high cost to the UK economy.</p> <p><em>Chris Combemale is executive director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.dma.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Direct Marketing Association</em></a><em> \u2013 follow the DMA on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/DMA_UK\" title=\"\"><em>@DMA_UK </em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>\"If we can't get the consumer involved, we will always be behind the curve.\" That's what M&amp;S CEO Marc Bolland said at the recent Plan A stakeholder consultation.</p> <p>The logic is compelling. It's a natural part of the journey to long-term success. Here are three steps to realising the need for action on consumer behaviour:</p> <h2><strong>Step one</strong><br></h2> <p>Look ahead 10, 20 or 30 years and identify the trends that would favour a strong future operating environment. This forces companies to look externally and identify the range of global issues that could prevent future success. They usually include issues such as energy, water and resource shortages.</p> <h2><strong>Step two</strong><br></h2> <p>Define your preferred future. That usually leads to identifying transformational programmes including projects that address the global issues found in step one. Smart companies can turn risks into opportunities as General Electric, GSK and IBM have done.</p> <p>At this point, the company is probably looking through what Marc Bolland describes as the \"industry lens\" and it may begin to make the changes required within the business and through the supply chain. After all, that's within its control.</p> <h2><strong>Step three</strong> <br></h2> <p>Companies then realise the critical importance of consumer behaviour change and the compelling case for change at scale comes into focus. For example, at Unilever the fact that consumer use of their products accounts for 68% of the company's greenhouse gas emissions is a strong reason for action.</p> <p><strong>But how do we persuade consumers to act?</strong></p> <p>The first option is to explore generic insight into behaviour change. Unilever, for example, has defined <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/images/Unilevers-Five-Levers-for-Change_tcm13-276805.pdf\" title=\"\">five levers for sustainable living</a> or tips to persuade consumers to act:</p> <p>\u2022 Make it understood (what you want people to do)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it easy (to act)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it desirable (to confirm customer's image of themselves)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it rewarding (demonstrate the benefit)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it a habit (remind people at the point of relevance)</p> <p>This approach is helpful. It benefits from insight into behavioural change including practical nudges such as social proof (if other people like me are doing it, it's increasingly likely that I will), choice editing (have people opt out rather than opt in), framing (frame the suggestion based on a knowledge of what will motivate them to act) and prompts (reminders at the point of relevance in space and time; much like the use of the green man for crossing the road).</p> <p>The kinds of examples here are recycling icons on Coke cans so it is easy to check if something can be recycled (prompt), editing out harmful ingredients from foods (choice editing), the introduction of \"me-size\" ready-made food portions, reminding people in car parks not to forget their bag for life (prompt), telling people in hotels the percentage of people who have re-used their towel in their hotel room (social proof, framing) or providing apps that make sustainable behaviours fun.</p> <p>However, nudges are not enough. Imagine I am a private sector utility and I want to reduce sewer blockages. Using the \"industry lens\" I focus on engineering solutions. Using the \"consumer lens\" for the first time I want to change customer behaviour and stop people putting the wrong stuff down sinks and loos.</p> <p>Traditional methods have always been ineffective even if they use behavioural insight. I don't just want to increase generic awareness of an issue and make it easy to act. I want to have a measurable outcome \u2013 fewer blockages. To achieve that I need a much deeper understanding of what material streams are causing blockages, what customer segments are putting these things down sinks and loos and a deep understanding of what would persuade people to act.</p> <p>That's what Anglian Water did with their <a href=\"http://keep-it-clear.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Keep It Clear</a> programme and within weeks achieved a measurable reduction in blockages.</p> <p>The difference is this. Nudges are usually informed tactics. To achieve real change at scale with a very high probability of success, you need to see customer behaviour change as a discipline and begin using the same professional standards as traditional marketing \u2013 except you are marketing behaviours, not products. You change one behaviour one audience at a time.</p> <p>The good news is that the discipline exists. It's called social marketing and it takes customer behaviour change beyond nudge tactics and into the world of customer behaviour change strategies that can persuade millions.</p> <p>This is a world in which you understand the six steps in a process to achieve real change, you understand the 10 major strategies to use to achieve change and you understand the 14 principle motivators that persuade people to act. It is a world of segmentation, of research, of behaviour and motivation analysis and of interventions \u2013 the points in the consumer journey where we touch their lives.</p> <p>It is a profession not just an understanding of current thinking on psychology, neuroscience and behavioural economics.</p> <p>It's a relatively new discipline and it works beyond the obvious behaviours. Sure, it can be used to help customers recycle more, save energy, save water, use bags for life or eat well. This is the discipline <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WRAP</a> used in the UK to dramatically increase home recycling. But the same approach can also be used to grow existing markets or create new markets.</p> <p>For example, banks could use it to persuade the 50% of people not currently saving for their long-term future to do so, which helps address a major social issue and grow their markets at the same time. And car manufacturers such as Nissan who are putting their weight behind electric cars could use it to create the market in electric vehicles. This change is not just about product purchase, it is a change in lifestyle. Simply making products available will not work on its own. There is a need to change what people think, feel, believe and do.</p> <p>Leaders are already using this approach as a discipline. In the next few years it will become a marketing norm. Sustainable business plans will feel more like long-term marketing plans. Skills in behaviour change, psychology and neuroscience will become core skills for all professional marketeers. And whatever it's called \u2013 social marketing, customer behaviour change or sustainable behaviour change, it's the next big thing. That's more than a prediction. It's a promise.</p> <p><em>John Drummond is chairman of </em><a href=\"http://www.corporateculture.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Corporate Culture</em></a><em>, a leading sustainable behaviour change agency</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

But in total, his sentence is 15 years and he may serve far less if given parole.</p> <p>Wang's lawyers have said he will not appeal. Analysts say there would be little point since his sentence will have been decided at a high level due to the sensitivity of the case.</p> <p>According to Xinhua, he told judges during the hearings that he confessed and repented his crimes, adding: \"For the Party organisations, people and relatives that have cared for me, I want to say here, sincerely: I'm very, very sorry. I've let you down.\"</p> <p>While coverage of the trial has been strictly controlled, a powerful editorial by business magazine Caixin's editor-in-chief Hu Shuli - published before the sentencing - said Wang had no choice but to enter the US consulate.</p> <p>\"When mafia members break up with their bosses, they can attempt to seek police protection. But in Chongqing and for the former police boss, there was nowhere to turn. And this perhaps encapsulates one of the greatest embarrassments of the country's current legal system,\" she wrote.</p> <p>Wang stood trial in hearings over two days in the southwestern city last week. The first day was held secretly because it touched on state secrets, according to his lawyer. The second was watched by a carefully vetted audience of a few dozen people.</p> <p>An official statement on his trial, issued by the court, had already hinted heavily that he would be treated leniently - with prosecutors citing factors such as his confession and the fact that he had given information on other people to investigators.</p> <p>A subsequent report from state news agency Xinhua <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/19/bo-xilai-murder-scandal-police-chief\">formally linked Bo to the case for the first time</a> - raising the chances of him too facing trial. </p> <p>Although it mentioned him only by position, rather than name, it described him scolding and hitting Wang after he alleged that Gu had murdered Heywood.</p> <p>The court had heard that Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu several days later, after he had been removed from police duties and three staff members had been illegally detained. There, he repeated his allegations to US diplomats - leading to British demands for a reinvestigation of Heywood's death last November. It had initially been ascribed to excessive alcohol consumption.</p>",
  "<p>For many businesses, a London postcode holds great allure. You'll pay a heavy premium to acquire one. But companies all over the UK are flourishing, proving that there's life outside of the capital.</p> <p>So how much does location really matter at a time when transport links are improving all the time and technology is evolving quicker than it ever has before? Is operating from outside of a major city a hindrance that can be overcome or is it, in fact, an advantage?</p> <p>Dale Stokes is the managing director of MDA. From its base in Blackburn, Lancashire, the company produces point of sale marketing materials for the likes of Cadbury and Coca-Cola.</p> <p>\"I think the perception that we all wear cloth flat caps in the north is long gone, but people still assume we're a million miles away,\" says Stokes. \"They hit the toll booth on the M6 and they think it's passport control.\"</p> <p>Blackburn is far enough outside of the capital to have its advantages, including cheaper labour and property prices.</p> <p>\"These are our two main costs and, where we are, they're simply lower than in many other areas of the country,\" explains Stokes. \"We've just acquired a new 250,000 square foot fulfilment centre which my competitors tell me would cost 160 to 170% more if it was down south. I pass these savings on to the customer and that becomes a huge selling point for us.\"</p> <p>Despite this, adds Stokes, Blackburn really isn't as remote as people might imagine.</p> <p>\"We're about two hours from central London by train, which is really only about a half hour longer than it takes some people I know to drive there from the outskirts of the city.</p> <p>\"The key to making long-distance relationships work is to be the best at what you do and have the best people in your team, to highlight the cost advantages and, if the distance is an issue, take the burden and go to them \u2013 but the world's a smaller place these days and that's easily overcome.\"</p> <p>Seb Mysko is managing director of Rising Digital, a digital marketing consultancy to the music industry. He has clients across eight countries, including big-name acts such as Deadmau5 and chart-topper Calvin Harris, and \u2013 he says \u2013 it doesn't matter to any of them where he is, nor even what time zone he's in.</p> <p>\"My clients don't care where in the world we are, as long as the effort that goes in remains uncompromised,\" says Mysko.</p> <p>For the record, Rising Digital is based in Leeds. And although Mysko says his business could operate anywhere there's broadband internet, a 3G signal and a kettle, the Yorkshire city has provided the perfect breeding ground for the talent which he's used to grow his team to six.</p> <p>\"Leeds is cool. It's humble, full of creatives, regenerated old industrial buildings and hidden gems. It's also unpretentious, unassuming and hard-working,\" he says.</p> <p>The university has helped create a youthful vibe in the area, and the company's Duke Studios has become a hub of activity with designers, developers and fashion industry insiders all rubbing shoulders on a daily basis.</p> <p>Mysko does, however, accept that some businesses do need easy access to the capital.</p> <p>\"If we were in the management or agency side of the music business then London, in my eyes, is the only option. A&amp;Rs, label managers and so on need to be on the ground doing meetings upon meetings every day \u2013 it's an absolute minimum requirement if you're looking to seriously progress a major artist in the UK.\"</p> <p>Another business that recognised this has been Timothy James Consulting. The recruitment company was established in 2003 by Chris O'Connell and rapidly grew to become one of the most important companies in the industry, earning a clutch of awards along the way.</p> <p>The company now employs 45 people at its headquarters, but after several years it became apparent that a London office was going to become a necessity to achieve further growth.</p> <p>\"We had picked up a lot of business in London and we had a strong client base there, so we felt there was a need for us to be 'local',\" says O'Connell. \"It's hard to work from outside a region and to convince others, as an outsider, that you really understand what they're about.\"</p> <p>Timothy James Consulting established its London office in May 2010. It now employs 20 people and is looking to double that amount in the near future. Late last year the company opened the doors to its Manchester office.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of gravitas to owning an office in London, but it's not the be-all-and-end-all,\" says O'Connell. \"The most important aspect is to have good people, good infrastructure and a good brand. Once you have that, you can do a job in any region.</p> <p>\"The reason we decided to move closer to London is because people wanted to feel closer to us.\"</p> <p>Of course, this varies from industry to industry and the line of work you're in. Paul Davidson is managing director of East Kilbride's Glencairn Crystal. The company's glassware retails throughout Scotland and to 40 countries across the globe.</p> <p>\"There'd be no advantages to us being in the city,\" says Davidson. \"I've travelled a lot and experienced city life and then I came back home. We have everything we need here, and our customers don't care where we're based.\"</p> <p>He established the business 30 years ago and some of his current staff have been with him since his first day. Such staff loyalty would be much harder to find in a fast-paced city, he says.</p> <p>\"People buy our products because of the craftsmanship and they deal with us as a company because of the personal relationships,\" says Paul. \"We employ local people because they understand the importance of these two factors, and they stick around long enough for it to become ingrained in what they do.</p> <p>\"Everything's much more aggressive and staff turnover is much higher when you're at the heartbeat of a city. The pace of life up here much better suits me and my team.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<h2>Rodgers' season begins at Carrow Road</h2> <p>\"The fans were phenomenal and appreciate what we are trying to do,\" said Brendan Rodgers after Liverpool's winless start to the Premier League season stretched to five games on Sunday. It was not a line from a troubled manager attempting to sugar-soap his own support. Anfield was firmly behind Rodgers against Manchester United and, unlike under the observing Roy Hodgson, a clear, positive philosophy is developing. But misfortune, injuries, refereeing decisions and a difficult fixture list hold only for so long. Liverpool's next three league games are against Norwich, Stoke and Reading. The step from \"relentless pressing and passing\" into wins must start soon. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <h2>Slim pickings for England</h2> <p>These are strange days when a man who is now firmly established as a regular for the England side cannot even get a place on the bench for his club team. James Milner has started eight of the nine England internationals since Roy Hodgson took over as manager but his omission from Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Arsenal was the third game in a row for which he has not even been required to put on his strip. Hodgson is entitled to be concerned that this could become a regular pattern, not least when considering the current predicament of the player next in line to Milner. Theo Walcott has been marginalised so much at Arsenal this season that a central midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, played on the right against City. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p> <h2>Chelsea's missing link</h2> <p>Juan Mata was as dynamic and inventive as ever on Saturday and Oscar grew into the game to exert a cunning and elegant influence. Eden Hazard had an off-day. But the prospect of that trio combining on a regular basis is thrilling. However, as Roberto Di Matteo acknowledged afterwards, for Chelsea to be truly deadly they need to make sure that the trio's conjuring does not come at the expense of width. What the manager did not say, of course, was that they could also do with a new centre-forward. Fernando Torres' form is such that if Daniel Sturridge returns to fitness as expected this week, there will be a strong case for him going straight into the team to play Arsenal. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <h2>Swansea's lack of togetherness</h2> <p>The excitement that greeted Swansea's back-to-back wins at the start of the season has quickly faded and there are a few worrying signs at the Liberty Stadium. Although Swansea carry a greater threat going forward under Michael Laudrup, there are concerns among the players that they have lost their defensive discipline. Their pressing game, which was so effective last season, was non-existent on Saturday and an excellent Everton side ran riot. Alan Tate, the Swansea central defender, made no attempt to conceal his anger with his team-mates. \"If people are going to play individually, we may as well pack up now,\" he said. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <h2>Bent and Benteke give Villa hope</h2> <p>There were not many positives for Aston Villa in their 4-1 defeat at Southampton but one was a first goal of the campaign for Darren Bent. Villa's \u00a318m striker looks to be forging a strong understanding with the new signing Christian Benteke, making his first start at St Mary's, and could have killed the game off had he not fired left-footed at Paulo Gazzaniga soon after the restart. Benteke then headed narrowly wide from the resulting flurry of corners and, although Villa's profligacy in front of goal cost them dear, there were encouraging signs that they should create far more chances under Paul Lambert than during the former regime. <strong>James Riach</strong></p> <h2>Jaaskelainen is past his best\u2026</h2> <p>Jussi Jaaskelainen was once a fine goalkeeper but the veteran's shaky form since leaving Bolton in the summer is a concern for West Ham. He committed a costly error in the 3-0 defeat by Swansea City and on Saturday the 37-year-old Finn should have done better with Steven Fletcher's goal for Sunderland. Perhaps West Ham might look to bring Robert Green back from QPR in January. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>\u2026but Friedel carries the flag for 40-year-olds</h2> <p>The French friends of Hugo Lloris huff and puff but Brad Friedel continues to justify Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's faith. The American kept a fragile Tottenham in the game against QPR with a string of first-half saves before the home side got off their knees to win. It was Friedel's 309th consecutive Premier League game; Lloris, France's No1 and \u00a313m of talent from Lyon, had plenty of time to wonder whether his first will come this side of Christmas. <strong>Robert Woodward</strong></p> <h2>Smooth passing is not enough</h2> <p>Is this the season Wigan come unstuck? Their only league win has come against Southampton and, while defeats by Manchester United and Chelsea are no way to gauge a season, a home defeat by Fulham might be. The dedication to smooth passing remains but without Victor Moses to change the pace, they look flat. \"Overall we need to be better,\" said Roberto Mart\u00ednez. \"It is time to open up competition for places.\" <strong>David Hills</strong></p> <h2>Football's Olympic spirit </h2> <p>Football is supposed, often with good cause, to be a cut-throat, ruthless business but at Newcastle it showed its human side. First Demba Ba and Hatem Ben Arfa, Newcastle's elected penalty-takers, allowed Papiss Ciss\u00e9 to take a penalty because their team-mate was struggling for form. No matter that Ciss\u00e9 missed horribly, it was the thought that counted. Then Chris Hughton, striving for a first League win with Norwich, disguised his disappointment to praise his team's chief tormentor Ben Arfa \u2013 a player he originally brought to Newcastle:\"I'm just pleased to see Hatem fit again and playing so well.\" The good news is that, if Wes Hoolahan keeps playing like this, Hughton should eventually get the rewards his class and dignity demand. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <h2>Reading's reality check </h2> <p>Reading still have a Championship look about them and are destined to struggle. The squad is desperately short of Premier League quality and the suspicion is that Pavel Pogrebnyak's decision to join the Royals, rather than Fulham, must have been motivated by something other than football. Brian McDermott clings to the belief that history repeats itself, and points out that Reading lost four of their first six games last season yet still won the Championship. Yes Brian, but there are no Peterboroughs, Doncasters and Barnsleys to facilitate a recovery this time. <strong>Joe Lovejoy </strong></p>",
  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p></p> <h2>Nigellissima<br>8.30pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Not a word, as such, but Nigellissima is smouldering telly cook Nigella Lawson's love letter to Italy \u2013 her \"spiritual home\", she reckons. It's filmed in a specially constructed replica of her own kitchen, rather than her actual one, a move which seems about as extravagant as some of the recipes she's peddling here. These include a calorific hazelnut chocolate cheesecake, and the \"meat-zza\". Yes, that's a meat-pizza, which jettisons bread in favour of purest mince. Fans will be pleased to note that lingering camera shots and effusive food descriptions prevail. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Masters of Money<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Stephanie Flanders's timely three-part series on the legacies of influential economic thinkers continues. This week, it's the turn of the ascetic free-market fundamentalist Friedrich Hayek, whose book The Road To Serfdom argued that governmental tampering with the economy was, however well-meaning, a sure route to tyranny. A host of panjandrums, including Mervyn King, Paul Krugman and Ron Paul, gather to discuss Hayek's theories, with varying degrees of scepticism. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Leaving<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>The final part of Tony Marchant's intergenerational love story picks up after the very public scene in the hotel breakfast room, where Michael accused Julie of having an affair. Julie now has to deal with her boss, who wants to see her leave, and her family, who don't want to listen to her explanations. Then there's the issue of her lover, Aaron, who has left his family home and his job; is it possible for the two of them, despite the age difference, lack of employment and the mess that their affair has created, to make it work? <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Tourettes: Let Me Entertain You<br>9pm, BBC3</h2> <p>It's showtime: after three months of preparation, our brave half-dozen are ready to sing like canaries before a live audience. As DJ and host Reggie Yates says: \"There's no medical explanation why they don't tic during their performance,\" but it's a phenomenon that has been noted elsewhere; tics often recede when focus is directed so completely on something else. What focus they have, too: \"Talent over Tourettes,\" as Yates puts it, with uniformly fantastic turns all round. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Health Before The NHS: The Road To Recovery<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>How did people access medical treatment before the creation of the NHS ushered in cradle-to-grave healthcare? Often in an ad-hoc fashion, if at all, according to the first of this two-part documentary looking back at the early part of the 20th century. The statistics are shocking: in 1900 it was reckoned 150 of every 1,000 babies died before celebrating their first birthday. Intentionally or not, this is a riposte to the fuzzy nostalgia that often surrounds talk of localism and the big society, and worth watching just for the section on the \"Peckham Experiment\", which pre-empted universal free healthcare. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Revenge<br>9pm, E4</h2> <p>It's not hard to see why Revenge has been among the biggest TV Stateside hits since Lost: the ongoing saga of treachery, murder and deceit among the photogenic rich folks of the Hamptons has a lurid, sultry, suspenseful and at times camp appeal, with Madeleine Stowe splendid as the icy matriarch Victoria. Tonight, we see what befalls one of her henchmen when he outlives his usefulness as Emily discovers who actually murdered her father, while Charlotte uses her tentacles and wiles to influence Declan's testimony on the witness stand. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709625\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348238998962/The-Paradise-BBC1s-new-de-010.jpg\" alt=\"The Paradise, BBC1's new department-store drama.

Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/Nick Briggs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Midsomer Murders<br>8pm, ITV1</h2> <p>It's one thing Midsomer being singled out by every homicidal fruitloop south of Birmingham, but when a meteorite decides to strike the county \u2013 along with the cranium of local stargazer Jeremy Harper \u2013 during an eclipse, suspicions are raised as to whether this really was just a cosmic coincidence. Local astrologer Mystic Mags (Maureen Lipman) claims that events around any eclipse are too chaotic to unravel, while some claim Harper was the latest victim of the infamous Moonstone Curse. Barnaby and Jones soon discover more intrigue, sexual tension and academic rivalry than you could shake Patrick Moore's xylophone at. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>The Paradise<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Adapted from a Zola novel, here we enter the world of \"England's first department store\" and its proprietor, Mr Moray. Moray is famed for his looks and oily charm, and his store has its plus points; it is no respecter of class barriers. But for all his twinkly eyes and high-street fabulism, Moray is by no means the good guy, delighting in the way his \"stack it high and sell it cheap\" philosophy will stamp out the little man. Oh, and then there's the issue of how his first wife met her mysterious end. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>The Boy Who Can't Forget<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Many of us can barely remember what we were doing last Tuesday, let alone during any given day 10 years ago. Yet 20-year-old Aurelien can give you an account of pretty much any 24-hour period you care to chuck at him. He's not the only one, either: psychologists are investigating a handful of people who claim the same gift, although for living Filofax Jill Price, tormented by decade-old slights, it's more of a curse: \"Everyone has baggage; I got a freaking steamer truck I'm dragging along.\" <em>AC</em></p> <h2>New Girl<br>9pm, E4</h2> <p>It's the season finale, and when Nick announces he's decided to move in with Caroline it could spell the end of the dysfunctional flatshare. But wait: there's an adventure in the desert to survive as a panic attack leads Nick to drive that removal van until he can drive no more. Just as well that Jess and Cece, the two characters least equipped to enjoy a face-off with a coyote in the desert, are there to rescue him. There's more dramatic fun to come as Schmidt and Cece reach breaking point, and Winston battles his biggest fear. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Cuckoo<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>New sitcom starring giant actor Greg Davies as patriarch Ken who is introduced to his new son-in-law Cuckoo for the first time in the arrivals lounge on his daughter Rachel's return from her gap year in Thailand. It's an understandable shock, particularly as Cuckoo is a colossal bellend. This travelling hippy (Andy Samberg) has spiritual psychobabble up the wazoo and hopes to loaf around his new family home while he writes a book. All but Ken and his son Dylan (Tyger Drew-Honey) are taken in by his cod philosophy, even his wife Lorna (Helen Baxendale); it's a pretty promising start. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>The Valleys<br>10pm, MTV</h2> <p>There aren't going to be many regions left to shrink with shame under the scrutiny of the reality TV camera at this rate. In the wake of the appalling Geordie Shore it's now the turn of a group of \"wannabes\" from Wales with pneumatic chests (and that's just the men) to celebrate their loss of dignity as they move from the countryside to a plush pad in Cardiff. What it is they \"wannabe\" is not quite crystal clear, but if it's to be the subject of merciless mockery from celebrity magazines, they're probably going the right way about it. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709626\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/3/1346679103191/Patrick-Duffy-and-Josh-He-006.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Duffy and Josh Henderson in the new-look Dallas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Duffy and Josh Henderson in the new-look Dallas. Photograph: Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dallas<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>Having so many of the original cast around for the remake is something of a blessing here: it's still thrilling to see Sue Ellen openly defying JR and running off for a meeting with Cliff Barnes. That's what Dallas is all about, conflict delivered with lip-quivering high camp. Yet, the lesser Ewings getting mired in a mess of changing loyalties is in danger of taking over, as Rebecca's growing feelings for Christopher threaten to scupper the con trick she's working with her brother. This show needs to get more ridiculous, fast. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>JK Rowling \u2013 Writing for Grown-Ups: A Culture Show Special<br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>JK Rowling's publisher tried to convince us that her tales of wizards and magic were suitable for adults, going so far as to produce editions with smart covers that grown ups wouldn't mind reading in public. Still, her new novel, The Casual Vacancy, is being proffered as her first effort at proper adult fiction. A blackly comic story of the small town of Pagford and the consequences of a parish councillor's death, it's an obvious departure for Rowling. Here, she discusses the book, her inspirations, and the challenges of taking on a post-Potter literary project. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>With concern from scientists that the Class A classification of MDMA is harming research on potential benefits for depression sufferers, Jon Snow and Christian Jessen present a study into the drug's effect on the brain. As part of the study, six volunteers including author Lionel Shriver and actor Keith Allen take MDMA \u2013 ecstasy in its pure form \u2013 and undergo a series of tests, while scientists David Nutt and Val Curren look at the short- and long-term effects for users. Concludes tomorrow. <em>MJ</em></p> <h2>Vincent: The Untold Story <br>7pm, SkyArts</h2> <p>Australian artists John and Di Koenders discovered they were distant relations of Vincent van Gogh in 2006 and set about researching his life in detail. They claim to give a \"rare insight\" into his life, particularly throwing light on his mysterious death. The narration questions his motives for suicide \"when he was just starting to gain recognition\" for his art. It's like Alan Partridge talking about the death of Kurt Cobain. A lot of biographical information, badly presented, reminiscent of one of those onboard films you get on hydrofoils. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Room at the Top<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>In a world where there exists a fast track from Eton to high office, an angry-young-man drama such as Room at the Top is probably timely. This two-parter adapts John Braine's novel about the rise of working-class Joe Lampton, a kind of Don Draper of his era. Trained as an accountant in a prisoner of war camp, Joe gets a job in the town hall of an affluent town, and sets about trying to have sex with every woman he meets. Matthew McNulty is good at bringing out Joe's cheek and chippiness, while Maxine Peake excels as Alice, the married woman with whom he \"takes up\". <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Girlfri3nds<br>9pm, ITV2</h2> <p>Three girls, 100 men and a whole load of hair flicking: this is dating, ITV2-style. Emma Willis presides over the action as air hostess Amy, single mum Sarah, and \"career girl\" Laura while they search for love. The rivals are supportive, refusing to step on each other's carefully painted toes as they become increasingly excited over the men on offer. \"You won the Lottery!\", \"You speak French!\", \"Your name's Ken!\" etc. Sweet though the girls are, watching them flirt, giggle and make rubbish jokes in front of 50 men might just make you lose heart by the end of the first episode. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709627\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347454365473/Wartime-Farm-tractor-008.jpg\" alt=\"Wartime Farm tractor\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everyday tale of rural folk \u2026 Wartime Farm. Photograph: Stuart Elliott/Lion Television/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Elliott/Lion Television/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wartime Farm<br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>More pantomime history as Ruth Goodman and archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn pretend that it's now 1941 on their wartime farm. The overdramatic narration reminds us that Britain began that year facing the nazis alone and the government was getting serious about food production, appointing agricultural inspectors. These \"War Ags\" had sweeping powers, removing some 2,000 people from their farms for underperforming. Meanwhile, on Manor Farm itself, the team are making use of a state-of-the-art tractor, as well as setting up the milking facilities for production. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Homefront<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>This new six-part series about the wives, partners \u2013 and one remarkably hardened mother \u2013 of soldiers serving in Afghanistan looks rather promising on the strength of the opener. It's a far cry from the buttoned-up anxiety of Mrs Bader in Reach for the Sky; these women strip for their partners on Skype and get merry on spirits they've sneaked into a nightclub. The pain of separation is palpable however, as is the sense of class division reflecting the military ranks. Outnumbered's Claire Skinner stars in a quality cast. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Making Faces<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The subject of facial reconstruction has long been fascinating to the public imagination, and this fine documentary series, focusing on the prosthetics experts and patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, couldn't be less prurient and more commendable if it tried. Cancer has left Diana with a hole in her face, but she hopes an artificial eye will do less to \"frighten the horses\" when she leaves the house. There's a new eye, too, for 16-year-old Holly. They're already heroic beyond words. <em>AC</em></p> <h2>Stephen Hawking's Grand Design<br>9pm, Discovery</h2> <p>Final part of the professor's superb new series. Tonight the world's most famous physicist asks, did God create the universe? No \u2026 but he does give his own crystal clear appraisal of man's interpretation of the universe through history. And he includes the compelling argument that, according to the laws of physics, the universe could just have popped into being one day with literally nothing there before it. Blow your mind, why don't you? <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Celebrity Ghost Stories<br>9pm, Bio</h2> <p>Return of a programme that inspires awestruck contemplation of the mysteries of the universe, though perhaps not quite in the manner intended by its producers. This is the first episode of the fourth series, suggesting that it is possible to attract a measurable audience simply by asking the vaguely famous to relate their self-evidently nonsensical testimonies of encounters with the paranormal. Tonight, Cindy Williams of Laverne &amp; Shirley, Joan Van Ark from Dallas and reality starlet Audrina Patridge are among those doing little to deflate the regrettably popular stereotype of actors as credulous moonbats. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Wilfred<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>Just when you think you've got a handle on this show it takes a few more unexpected turns, taking it further away from a cute yarn about a talking dog and into a disturbing tale of mental illness and obsessive relationships. A hilarious musical montage is added to the mix as Ryan and Wilfred take \"Doggie Dancing\" classes. While this gives opportunities for some spirited slapstick, the show dumps salt onto its sweetness by having the pair discuss their first sexual experiences. Who knew something as joyful as dancing with a dog could be so dark and unwholesome? <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709628\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347538220731/Moone-Boy-Series-1-008.jpg\" alt=\"Moone Boy; Series 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Rawle with imaginary friend Chris O\u2019Dowd in Moone Boy. Photograph: Patrick Redmond</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Redmond/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Island Hospital<br>8pm, ITV1</h2> <p>Another behind-the-scenes hospital series, but this one opts for the whimsical island life of the Bailiwick of Guernsey rather than inner city stress. Princess Elizabeth Hospital serves the island's 66,000 residents, and its staff provide the focus for this documentary series, now into its third episode. Tonight's action, such as it is, sees surgeon Suzy Dorey helping out at Saumarez Park to prepare for a royal visit, two paramedics rescuing a bowls champion, and lawyer Adrian Sarchet's bid to swim the Channel scuppered by a shoulder injury. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Servants: The True Story Of Life Below Stairs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Go back a century and 1.5 million people worked as servants. As social historian Dr Pamela Cox explores in this new series, their lives didn't involve Downton-like familiarity with employers. Instead, this was a world of hard graft and harder class demarcations, with some bosses giving generic names to those occupying specific jobs, to save the bother of remembering real names. Despite this, Cox still finds traces of specific individuals, such as servant William Tayler, whose revealing diary bemoans a lack of \"liberty\". <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Being Liverpool<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>Watching this fly-on-the-waller \u2013 filmed over the summer \u2013 in concert with Liverpool's undercooked start to the league season makes for an odd experience, the optimism and jollity of a pre-season under new manager Brendan Rodgers jarring uncomfortably with a record that currently reads: played four, won zero. This week's episode sees Rodgers oversee the club's first fixtures on their tour of the States. Meanwhile, back in the present, Liverpool face a tricky-looking fixture away at Norwich. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>Live Ryder Cup Golf<br>12.30pm, Sky Sports 1</h2> <p>The 39th Ryder Cup once again affords sports fans the chance to feel patriotic about their continent as Europe looks to retain the trophy on US turf, since the tournament takes place at the Medinah Country Club in Illinois. Europe's captain, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, has selected Ian Poulter and rookie Nicolas Colsaerts as his wildcards to join Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood, among others, while the US line-up includes Bubba Watson, Jason Dufner, and, of course, Mr T Woods. Sky's coverage is available in both HD and 3D. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Moone Boy<br>9.30pm, Sky1</h2> <p>Gently does it, as Chris O'Dowd's imaginary friend helps cute little Martin Moone through more childhood challenges in this cockle-warming tale. This week, there's a trouser incident after wide-eyed Martin watches one too many TV shows involving \"grunty Argentinian tennis ladies\". Sean (O'Dowd) is too busy enjoying a night at the pub with fellow fantasy figures including the legendary wrestler Crunchy Haystacks (Johnny Vegas) to offer Martin much-needed advice. Luckily, Uncle Danny the busker arrives home with wise words and tales of hanging out with U2. Subtle laughs all round. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Sea of Death<br>10pm, Yesterday</h2> <p>In early 1945, as the Soviet army pushed west, millions of German refugees \u2013 both troops and civilians \u2013 fled from the onslaught. But the journey through the Baltic was perilous, due to Russian submarines targeting ships such as the Wilhelm Gustloff. When that liner was torpedoed, 9,400 souls perished, the largest loss of life from a single ship in naval history. This marine archaeology documentary rather lacks a central narrative, but it's worth watching for eerie underwater footage of the Gustloff and two other wrecks, the Steuben and the Goya. <em>JW</em></p>",

  "<p>Key among the things to be addressed when launching a social enterprise is staffing. A variety of workforce issues need to be considered. These will vary depending on whether the organisation is a new business with no existing staff, a startup, or a business that is spinning out from a larger organisation, often in the public sector, with existing employees transferring with it. The nuances are outlined below.</p> <h2><strong>Startups</strong></h2> <p>When forming a social enterprise it is crucial to get the right people on board to ensure that the values and ethics that will drive the social enterprise to success are understood and filter down throughout the organisation. As such, you must ensure that your recruitment process reflects this.</p> <p>The recruitment process should consist of at least two interviews to ensure that applicants are suitably vetted. Interview questions and, if applicable, exercises should be considered carefully to succeed in identifying key qualities. At least two references should be requested from former employers or, where appropriate, a non-employment referee. A probationary period can be used as a trial to test the employee's suitability in practice. The period will usually be between three and six months, depending on the role.</p> <p>Employees employed after 6 April 2012 will only be able to claim unfair dismissal after completing two years' service (prior to this the qualifying period was 12 months).</p> <p>This gives employers a better opportunity to vet employees but note that certain claims may be pursued without needing a qualifying period, including discrimination, so a probationary period is still a useful way of managing expectations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/18/contents\" title=\"\">The Employment Rights Act 1996</a> requires employers to put in place a statement of specific terms and conditions of employment within two months of an employee starting work. These are usually set out in a contract of employment which would include more than the statutory minimum terms.</p> <p>On the whole, employment legislation is designed to protect the rights of employees but a well-drafted contract of employment can offer the employer flexibility and protection.</p> <p>A staff handbook should be put in place, as this can go into further detail than the contract to manage the employment relationship and expectations of the parties. It could include policies such as health and safety, family rights, dress code, and internet and mobile phone usage. The list is endless and should be bespoke to each organisation, so as to offer maximum protection.</p> <p>The staff handbook need not be contractual. Contractual policies must be followed by the parties and can only be varied by agreement. Non-contractual policies serve as guidance. Ideally, the handbook should be drafted so that obligations on the employee are contractual and obligations on the employer are non-contractual to give the employer more scope to vary the policy or deviate from its terms.</p> <h2><strong>Spinning out</strong></h2> <p>Employers seeking to spin-out into a social enterprise will face very different staff issues. Where a service transfers from one organisation (the transferor) to another (the transferee) the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/246/contents/made\" title=\"\">Regulations 2006 (TUPE)</a> may well apply to transfer employees' contracts of employment to the transferee, so protecting their continuity of service and terms and conditions of employment.</p> <p>Employees transferring from the public sector benefit from greater protection in terms of pension provision than those transferring from private sector organisations. The transferee will need to ensure that it can offer comparable pension benefits, which can be costly. A comprehensive due diligence exercise will need to be carried out to confirm the application of TUPE, identify which employees will fall within the scope of the regulations and to determine the terms and conditions of employment of those employees to establish what the staff costs will be.</p> <p>TUPE prohibits the harmonisation of contracts of employment with existing employees. However, terms and conditions may be varied in limited circumstances. This might include changing working hours or pay, but caution must be exercised in such circumstances, as the legislation is not always clear cut.</p> <p>TUPE requires the transferor to inform and consult with employees prior to a transfer. Particularly when spinning out, it is a good idea for the transferee to take part in the consultation process and engage with trade union representatives to get employees on board early on and share the vision of the new organisation.</p> <p>It would be prudent to go through contracts of employment and the staff handbook carefully to ensure you are familiar with the employees' entitlements and avoid any disagreement in future.</p> <p>Whether starting up or spinning out, employers would benefit from familiarising themselves with their legal obligations in relation to staff to avoid costly claims.</p> <p><em>Gemma Brown is employment law specialist with public services law firm </em><a href=\"http://www.tpplaw.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>TPP Law</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Apple's new maps offering has drawn huge amounts of ire from users used to having Google Maps on their device. But it's far from the company's first brush with a PR embarrassment. What's surprising is how many of them it has managed to ride over and turn into success. Will maps be the same \u2013 or cause lasting damage? </p> <h2>Apple Maps - September 2012</h2> <p>The introduction by Apple of its own mapping service in iOS6, the operating software rolled out to iPhones and iPads on Wednesday 19 September, has been one of its worst PR disasters. Although the update has brought voice-driven turn-by-turn navigation, users have complained that the new maps, which replace Google's \u2013 in use on the iPhone since 2007 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/20/apple-maps-ios6-station-tower\">lack accuracy, clarity and detail</a>. In response, Apple said that \"We launched this new map service knowing it is a major initiative and that we are just getting started with it. Maps is a cloud-based solution and the more people use it, the better it will get. We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better.\"</p> <p>In other words, it knows that people aren't liking it. But it hasn't got a quick fix \u2013 and for people missing public transport information since the loss of Google, the only options are to use Google's maps in the browser (maps.google.co.uk), hope that the map will get you there, or \u2013 when all else fails \u2013 buy a paper map.

Getting every item in the world in the right place with the right name is no small task \u2013 but Apple seems to have embarked on it, for better or worse.</p> <h2>iPhone 4 antenna \u2013 July 2010</h2> <p>\"Antennagate\", as it was inevitably known, began when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/24/iphone-reception-problems-bottom-edge\">new owners of the iPhone 4 started using their devices</a> - and discovering that the new design had worse reception when their hand bridged the gap between the two external antennae on the lower left. Some complained by email to Steve Jobs - who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/jun/25/iphone-reception-problems-solved\">responded</a> \"don't hold it that way\". </p> <p>Although Jobs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/24/steve-jobs-biography-antennagate\">thought that the claims were a smear campaign</a>, two weeks later he fronted a press conference at which he said that Apple would offer a free \"bumper\" for the phones \u2013 while also saying that only 0.55% of iPhone 4 owners had complained to Apple about problems. The iPhone 4 was knocked off PR World's \"Top 10 Cell Phones\" list. Separate testing by AnandTech suggested that the iPhone 4 was actually more sensitive to mobile signals than its predecessor. The iPhone 4 sold substantially more than the 3GS, and is still on sale today.</p> <h2>The buttonless iPod shuffle - March 2009</h2> <p>The what? That's right: Apple <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1139333/iPod_shuffle_design.html\">released an iPod with no buttons at all</a>, and it wasn't even April Fool's Day. You were meant to control it through your headphones, which <em>would</em> have a button. In September 2010, Apple updated the line. Guess what? No more buttonless iPod shuffles; instead, they now had buttons again. (Thanks Michael DeGusta for <a href=\"http://twitter.com/degusta/status/250133326847959040\">pointing that one out</a>.)</p> <h2>MobileMe \u2013 July 2008</h2> <p>The launch of MobileMe \u2013 Apple's first big foray into cloud computing \u2013 was meant to be a proud moment. Apple created a paid-for service which was meant to synchronise email, calendars, address books and settings between Macintosh computers and iPhones. It launched at the same time as the iPhone 3G, the App Store, and the iPhone 2.0 software update.</p> <p>But instead of being a triumph, MobileMe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/31/apple.email\">turned into a fiasco</a>, with people failing to receive email and the service suffering long outages. In an email to staff, Jobs said that the launch, which saw repeated outages, was \"not up to Apple standards\". He was more brutal with the staff of the MobileMe division, whom he called into a meeting hall and berated. \"Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to do?\" he asked. On receiving an answer, he responded: \"So why the fuck doesn't it do that?\" The head of the team was fired in front of the rest. Jobs later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/aug/05/stevejobsregretsmobilemeco\">apologised publicly</a>.</p> <p><br><em>MobileMe became iCloud. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/osde-info/\">osde8info</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em></p> <p>MobileMe morphed in 2011 into iCloud \u2013 which now provides storage for millions of iPads and iPhones, as well as doing the functions of MobileMe for email, and delivering text message-style iMessages over mobile data. </p> <h2>Original iPhone price cut - September 2007</h2> <p>The first iPhone was released in June 2007, priced at $600 for the 8GB version (there was also a 4GB version). In September, Apple <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/technology/07apple.html\">abruptly dropped the price</a> by $200 - leading to howls of protests and overflowing email inboxes at Apple. Within days, Steve Jobs acknowledged the mistake and said: \"Our early customers trusted us, and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these.\" Early buyers were given $100 of credit for the Apple Store; Jobs defended the fact it was not the full $200 by saying that \"this is life in the technology lane\". </p> <p>The price drop did apparently help sales in the phone's first Christmas.</p> <h2>iMovie HD replaced by iMovie 08 - August 2007</h2> <p>By the time iMovie, Apple's free cut-it-yourself movie-making software, had reached version 6 (aka \"HD\") it had reached a sort of nirvana, offering a timeline to drag clips into, effects, separate sound volume controls, and simple import. Inexplicably, it then replaced it with iMovie 08 - a complete and user-mystifying departure from the features of its predecessor. The outcry was so great that Apple eventually had to offer iMovie HD as a separate download; it's still so popular that copies are sold on eBay. (Thanks Roy van Veen <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Royalty/status/250129996805443584\">on Twitter</a> for the suggestion.)</p> <h2>iPod nano screen \u2013 September 2005</h2> <p><br><em>A scratched iPod nano screen, October 2005. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/weedavid/\">weedavid</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>The tiny Flash-based nano, which Jobs unveiled by pulling out of his jeans coin pocket, had a colour screen \u2013 but early users quickly discovered that it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2005/sep/26/problemssurfac\">scratched rather easily</a>. With the nano being key to Apple's plans to dominate iPod sales at Christmas, the early response from Apple was no response. Instead it huddled for a while before responding, some days later, to say there was a problem with a small batch of screens. </p> <p>The nano went on to drive Apple's biggest ever quarter of sales.</p> <h2>Revealing the PowerMac G5 \u2013 2003</h2> <p>Steve Jobs wanted the glory of unveiling the new Power Mac G5 desktop computer. Unfortunately his web team got there first: a mistake in the setup meant that the picture and specifications of the device were shown on the Apple website on the Sunday evening before his Monday speech, for long enough for screenshots to be snapped. Jobs referred to it in his speech as \"premature specification\". A website management position became vacant not long afterwards. </p> <h2>The Cube computer \u2013 2000</h2> <p><br><em>Back view of the Cube. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ian_munroe/\">ianmunroe</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>Shown off proudly by Steve Jobs in July 2000, the Cube (literally a seven-inch cube) was a fanless desktop computer (for which you had to bring your own screen and keyboard) aimed, Apple said, at \"prosumers\" \u2013 people who wanted professional-level power at consumer-y prices. Though the cubic design looked good, the fact that you couldn't add full-size graphics cards or upgrade the RAM, and that the price without a screen was higher than for a full-powered desktop Power Mac murdered sales. In addition, some had manufacturing problems that led to mould lines \u2013 or cracks - appearing in the sides. Apple put the Cube on ice in July 2001.</p> <h2>The Mac's missing CD burners \u2013 2000</h2> <p>In 1999, Napster exploded onto the internet, offering a completely new (if legally dubious) way of accessing huge amounts of music stored on other peoples' PCs. Abruptly, people began downloading music, and burning CDs of music. But at Apple, Steve Jobs was sure that the way forward was DVD playback \u2013 and so iMacs, PowerBooks and iBooks included DVD drives by default, not CD-burning drives. Potential customers turned away: Apple Mac sales dropped by a third while that of the PC market grew by 10%. In November 2000 Jobs warned analysts that Apple would see lower profits: we \"completely missed the boat\" he admitted to them: \"We just blew this one.\"</p> <p>Within a year, Apple had launched the iPod - which was only a theoretical idea when he spoke to analysts. </p> <h2>The \"hockey puck\" mouse - September 1998</h2> <p><br><em>Spot the odd one out: the iMac's USB mouse was an ergonomic nightmare. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/moparx/\">moparx</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>Along with the attractive curves of the first iMac, Apple introduced a new mouse which was circular, rather than the more usual oval. Unfortunately, nobody seems to have tested it to see what extended (or even brief) use would be like. The \"hockey puck\" was incredibly frustrating to use because it gave no clues to the hand about which was the front or back, and which was the side. That meant the onscreen mouse often moved in the wrong direction. People who bought iMacs soon found they needed to spend on a third-party mouse as well, to the delight of third-party mouse manufacturers, who saw a brief boom \u2013 which, ironically, persuaded many that Apple might be a company worth building add-ons for. </p> <p>That latter effect was amplified by the number of iMac users who had to buy new peripherals, because the iMac dumped the floppy drive and adopted USB wholesale \u2013 both moves that Windows PC companies held off doing. The add-on accessory business for Apple products including the iPod, iPhone and iPad (and to a lesser extent Macs) is now worth billions every year.</p> <p>Somehow, the awfulness of the hockey puck mouse lasted 18 months before Jobs killed it in January 2000, citing its terrible reviews, and introducing an oval-shaped optical mouse which still \u2013 like all Apple mice before and since \u2013 only had one button.</p> <h2>The Newton \u2013 1993</h2> <p><br><em>Apple Newton beside an iPhone. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/\">blakespot</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>The Newton was meant to be an intelligent \"personal digital assistant\" (a phrase coined by John Sculley and a Toshiba executive over dinner one evening). It would decipher handwriting and carry contact details and in essence be the first Apple iPhone \u2013 but years before the iPhone. However, the handwriting recognition was deeply flawed (unsurprising given the ambition of the project and the comparatively underpowered processors of the day) and the device was costly. Steve Jobs <a href=\"http://www.pencomputing.com/frames/newton_obituary.html\">finally killed the Newton</a> not long into his return.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Unhappy reunions</strong> Not everybody missed Peyton Manning. In fact, one team positively relished his absence. During their first nine years in the league, the Houston Texans never once made the playoffs \u2013 trapped as they were behind Manning's Colts in the AFC South. Last year, with Manning undergoing neck surgery that caused him to miss the entire season, the Texans won the division.</p> <p>The full picture was more nuanced than that, of course, Houston's success owing much to their own emergence at last as a complete team. A franchise which relied for years on a high-powered passing offense now had a proven 1,000-yard rusher in Arian Foster and even more crucially the league's second-ranked defence. They would even succeed in winning a playoff game with their third-string quarterback under center.</p> <p>Nevertheless, life was certainly easier without Manning present. No team has struggled quite so much against the quarterback as Houston \u2013 winning just two of their 18 games against his Colts. Manning has thrown 42 touchdowns against them over the course of his career, and posted a combined passer rating in those games of 110.6.</p> <p>This might not be the same Manning, of course, the quarterback's three interceptions in the first quarter against Atlanta last week suggesting that his arm strength had certainly been diminished by the travails of the last 12 months. But Houston certainly will not be taking that for granted. </p> <p>The Texans are one of just six teams still without a defeat after two weeks, and though the opposition were not the most impressive they have aspirations of a Super Bowl run. But Denver did not bring in Manning just to make up numbers, either. Early in the season it may be, but for both teams this is already a significant match-up. And for Manning, too, a chance to see if old habits die hard.</p> <!-- Block 2 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4FlwJwL6kdo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4FlwJwL6kdo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Athletes advertising</strong> If you, like me, are watching this game in the US then you can be confident that you won't just be seeing Manning when his team is on the field.

Rather than repeat myself, here's what I said there:</p> <blockquote> <p>As for Manning, he returns home from his three-interception game against the Falcons to face a Houston defense which is among the best in the league. The Texans defensive lineman <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/ultimatetexans/2012/09/j-j-watt-i-want-no-18-on-my-sack-list/\">JJ Watt has stated his intention to add No18 to the list of quarterbacks he has sacked</a>; his team-mates in the defensive backfield may be licking their lips after seeing Manning struggling to generate sufficient power on a number of key throws in Atlanta. The Broncos will be the first significant test of this Houston team, but I like the Texans to seal their first ever 3-0 start to a season.</p> <p><strong>Texans to win</strong></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Update from the early games</strong> Some surprising scorelines out there right now.

Forced into first and 20 by a pair of pre-snap penalties, Schaub drops back and launches an exocet over the middle to Andre Johnson - the ball travelling 40 yards through the air and another 20 in the receiver's hands as he strolls in for the score. There was a blown coverage on the back end, but it was still a beautiful throw.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Texans 7 Broncos 5, 6:00 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> Yup, Manning'll take that challenge. Taking over from the Broncos 20, he opens up their new series with a 36-yard completion to Decker on the post pattern. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltD21rYWVw\">Chicks dig the long ball</a>,\" tweets @jryke, picking up our athletes in adverts thread.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Texans 7 Broncos 5, 3:10 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> It didn't take long for Watt to get that sack of Manning that he had spoken about - or at least a share of one - the end bulldozing through his blocker to collapse the pocket as the quarterback was dropping back on third and five from the Houston 37. The Broncos had been in range for a long field goal but instead must settle for a punt. Colquitt, though, is doing a fine job with those, and this time pins the Texans to their own two-yard line.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Texans 7 Broncos 5, 0:52 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> Ben Tate and Arian Foster is a pretty nice set of backfield options to have when you're backed up against the goalline. The former bulldozes his way out for seven yards on first down to create a little breathing room, before the latter darts through the line behind his right guard and then tears off up the sideline towards midfield two plays later. Despite three false starts and that safety on that opening play, this has been a confident start on offense from Houston.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>End of 1st quarter: Texans 7 Broncos 5</strong> The Texans end the first quarter looking at third and one just shy of midfield. On Twitter, CAKiwi18 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjHazHg0CoA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">has a different favourite Peyton commercial</a>.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Texans 7 Broncos 5, 12:26 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> More confident throwing from Schaub, who fires it to Martin over the middle for 18 yards on a third and 12.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! Texans 14 Broncos 5, 10:47 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Well they made that look easy. A 97-yard drive for Houston concludes with Schaub dumping the ball off to Foster in the right corner of the end zone from three yards out. Against a defence like Denver's and after the start they'd had, this is really impressive stuff from Houston.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Texans 14 Broncos 5, 10:42 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Bolden fields Graham's kick-off at the one, and takes it out to the 18. \"Terry Tate Office Linebacker - best sports star commercials ever,\" tweets @MickDigginPhoto - and though I'm not certain that Terry Tate <em>quite </em>qualifies as a real athlete, I'm not going to pass up the excuse <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzToNo7A-94\">to drop in one of these</a>.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Texans 14 Broncos 5, 9:51 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> The first three-and-out of the game belongs to the Broncos - Manning getting the ball where it needed to be after his line did a great job picking up the backside blitz on third-and-six, but the ball slipping between Ball's arms. The punt comes back to the Texans 43.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! Texans 21 Broncos 5, 8:54 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Oh my. Houston are out to make a statement this afternoon, and right now it is coming across loud and clear. After a five-yard pick-up by Foster on first down, Schaub goes for the jugular once again, hooking up with Walter on a 52-yard scoring strike. The receiver had single coverage and got position on his defender, before angling sharply across the field on a post. By the time the ball got to him, he was able to run in untouched. The Broncos are in trouble.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 5, 8:54 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> The kick-off goes for a touchback. Schaub has completed eight of 10 passes so far in this game for 177 yards, three scores and a perfect quarterback rating.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 5, 6:56 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> The Broncos needed a response and so far they're getting one - rapidly moving the length of the field with the help of some productive after-the-catch running from Tamme and a roughting the passer penalty against Houston's Brian Cushing. Just like that, they're down inside the Texans' 10-yard line.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Field goal! Texans 21 Broncos 8, 5:45 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> That, though, was not what they would have been hoping for after such a long drive. Prater chips it through the posts after Manning is unable to steer his team into the end zone - a miscommunication with his receivers leading him to throw way off target on first down, before he is unable to float it in to Demayrius Thomas on third after a short Foster run. Two trips to the red zone have now yielded six points for the Broncos - which might be acceptable on another day, but feels like it might not be against this high-octane Houston offence.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 8, 4:58 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Then again ... Houston follow up by going three-and-out for the first time in this game - and indeed failing to convert a third down for the first time in this game: Schaub unable to squeeze the ball in to a well-covered Walter on third and nine. The Texans punt, and Denver are going to take over near their own 40-yard line.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 8, 3:31 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> But Houston respond by shutting Denver right back down, Cushing stepping up to make the stop as McGahee looked for room over the left side of the line on third and four. Colquitt's punt is returned four yards to the Houston 16 by Holliday. Nate Irving - who made the tackle on the return - is down hurt, falling to the ground limp immediately after making the hit. They're taking a TV break as he receives treatment. Here's hoping it's not too serious.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Two minute warning: Texans 21 Broncos 8</strong> Irving has recovered sufficiently to withdraw to the bench, though we were away on commercial while he did, so I can't tell you if he got there under his own power. Play has resumed, in any case, and Houston are on the move again - Schaub dropping the ball into the hands of his tight end Graham, who rumbles out to near halfway. Houston will have a first down there after the TV time-out.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 8, 1:14 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> CBS just informed us that Houston have outscored opponents 40-3 in the last two minutes of halves over their last five games. That's some going, and they are looking to improve further on that statistic here as Schaub hits Daniels at the 39 for a fresh set of downs on third and eight.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Interception! Texans 21 Broncos 8, 0:34 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> So much for that! Schaub steps up into the pocket two plays later, looking for Walter on another third down, but Wesley Woodyard leaps up to make an athletic interception, reaching out a hand and pulling the ball in before appearing to return it deep into Houston territory - only for the officials to rule he had stepped out at the beginning of the return. Nevertheless, Denver will have a chance to cut the deficit before half-time, taking over from near their own 40-yard line.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Field goal! Texans 21 Broncos 11, 0:01 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Prater nails a 53-yard field goal, cutting Houston's lead to 10 points, after Manning hooked up with Decker on successive passes to bring his team into range. There is still one second left on the clock, so Denver will have to kick off again before they can go in for the break.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>End of 2nd quarter: Texans 21 Broncos 11</strong> Prater's squib kick is covered by Houston, and that will be it for the first half. The Texans have been the more impressive team, but two blown plays on offence - a safety to begin the half and a pick to end it - have kept the Broncos within touching distance. Should be an interesting second half.</p> <!-- Block 33 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myDYE49KPlQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myDYE49KPlQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>How else to fill half-time ...</strong> But with another commercial - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myDYE49KPlQ\">this one from @jk_fly on Twitter</a>. \"Absolutely one of my favorites due to the twist...\" he notes.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>More final scores</strong> Here are the rest of the results from today's early games. A remarkable result in New Orleans, with the Chiefs scoring 21 unanswered points from the middle of the third quarter to relegate the Saints to 0-3.</p> <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10 Dallas Cowboys 16<br>Jacksonville Jaguars 22 Indianapolis Colts 17<br>New York Jets 23 Miami Dolphins 20 (OT)<br>Kansas City Chiefs 27 New Orleans Saints 24 (OT)<br>Detroit Lions 41 Tennessee Titans 44<br>Cincinnati Bengals 38 Washington Redskins 31</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 11, 15:00 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Prater's kick-off to start the half goes for a touchback. \"I saw Jets at Dolphins earlier. Lots of empty seats,\" writes Niall Mullen by email. \"Is that typical for Miami or the NFL in general?\" Definitely the former, in recent years, Niall, though the NFL as a whole is facing up to a growing problem in that department. With tickets as expensive as they are and an increasing number of people arguing that you get a better experience watching at home - with replays, internet access and ability to track multiple games at once, lots of teams are finding it harder to get people to the stadiums. That ought to be negated by the blackout rule - which states a game cannot be televised locally if it does not sell out, but even then several teams buy out their own tickets (which they can do at a reduced rate) to avoid such an outcome.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 11, 14:10 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> A perfect start to the half for Denver - Schaub throwing incomplete twice either side of a short Foster run, before Houston are forced to punt. The Broncos will take over at their own 32 after a short return from Leonhard.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 11, 12:56 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> The Broncos take their turn to go three-and-out before Bolden makes the bonehead move on punt coverage, crashing into the would-be return man Holliday before he had his hands on the ball. As a returner himself, Bolden should know better. The 15-yard penalty will bring Houston up to their 38-yard line.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 11, 11:32 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> More foolishness from Denver, Von Miller driving Schaub into the ground after the quarterback had released the ball for a short completion on third and two. With the penalty, Houston are already down to the Denver 36.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Texans 21 Broncos 11, 11:06 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> And there's another one - Mays giving up another 15 yards on the very next play for roughing the passer: this time for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Schaub. To his credit, the quarterback had very nearly completed the pass anyway, lofting the ball over a defender and into the hands of Andre Johnson streaking down the left sideline. The receiver appearead to have reeled it in, but couldn't quite cling on in the end zone. Houston move down to the Denver 21, but Schaub, who seems to be bleeding from the ear, has to step out for a moment. TJ Yates will replace him.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Field goal! Texans 24 Broncos 11, 9:16 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Schaub returns after a single play on the sidelines, but after a holding penalty on third and two, he is unable to get the ball into the hands of Martin over the middle of the field. Houston settle for a 41-yard field goal.</p> <!-- Block 41 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_qsLvBkNvHo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_qsLvBkNvHo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Texans 24 Broncos 11, 9:11 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> \"My favourite sportsperson endorsement <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qsLvBkNvHo\">has to be this one</a>,\" writes Sean Clayton by email, as Bolden takes the kick-off out to the Denver 26. \"Purely for the nightmarish quality of Carlton emerging from the bath and the questions it raises. How long has he been down there for? Why is he still wearing an off-brand Wednesday shirt? The phrase 'We're going to need a bigger bath...' always comes to mind.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Texans 24 Broncos 11, 7:18 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Through their first seven offensive plays in this half, the Denver Broncos had gained 0 yards, net. On the eighth, Peyton Manning hit Decker on a 36-yard completion down the right sideline. Only for it to be wiped out by a holding penalty.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Texans 24 Broncos 11, 6:56 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Manning takes his shot down the middle of the field on third and 17, and is fortunate not to be picked off after the ball hops off Decker's hands and very nearly falls into those of one of two nearby defensive backs. Denver still have a net output of zero offensive yards so far this half. They have 55 yards of penalties in the same period.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Texans 24 Broncos 11, 5:08 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> The good news for the Broncos is that Houston really haven't got much going this half yet either. They go three-and-out as well, and Jones's punt hops into the end zone for a touchback. Frustrating second half all-round so far.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Texans 24 Broncos 11, 3:59 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Another three plays with nothing doing for Denver. This feels like an opportune moment to let you know the following scores from the rest of the ongoing games right now:</p> <p>Arizona Cardinals 24 Philadelphia Eagles 6<br>Atlanta Falcons 27 San Diego Chargers 3<br>Pittsburgh Steelers 24 Oakland Raiders 21</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Texans 24 Broncos 11, 2:14 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Could that be the moment to kick this game out of its second-half slumber? On second and 10 from the Houston 39, Schaub opens out to his right but then turns back to his left, putting the ball up high where only the 6ft 3ins Lestar Jean can get to it. The man covering him, Chris Harris, ought to have made the tackle for not much more than a first down, but got caught out trying to make the play on the ball and wound up taking himself out of the equation, allowing Jean to dash off down the sideline for a 46-yard gain.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! Texans 31 Broncos 11, 1:39 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Two plays later Schaub finds Owen Daniels on a crossing route, and the tight end plunges through a tackler into the end zone. Long way back from here for Denver.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>End of 3rd quarter: Texans 31 Broncos 11</strong> The Broncos finally get moving, Manning completing successive passes to Decker, then one to Thomas, to end the quarter with his team looking at second and seven from the Houston 47. Denver need a touchdown on this drive.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 11, 14:39 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Instead the Broncos once again grind to a halt, Manning throwing incomplete on the next two plays and John Fox deciding to punt. At 20 points down in the fourth, would this perhaps not have been a moment to consider taking a shot? Houston, have never before started a season 3-0, but right now it feels pretty close.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 11, 11:51 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> \"I can remember many a Sunday over the years where I have spent most of the commercial breaks in the garage beating the hell out of my punching bags,\" writes Dan S by email, as Schaub lofts the ball up in the direction of Andre Johnson - looking for, and getting, an illegal contact flag that will gift his team a fresh set of downs at their 40. \"Feels good to have a team that can go up against a great team, and know you have a good chance time win. Go Texans!\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Fumble! Texans 31 Broncos 11, 10:20 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Just when the Texans seemed to be building a clock-eating drive, Tate coughs up the ball crossing midfield, Denver's Vickerson both causing and covering up the fumble. Could there be a way back in here yet for the Broncos?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! Texans 31 Broncos 18, 9:49 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> There might just! Manning is in no mood waste time, lifting a pass over a defender and into the path of Brandon Stokley on a straightforward fly pattern straight up the middle of the field. From 38 yards out, the receiver quite simply outsprinted the coverage into the end zone. Suddenly, Mile High Stadium has come alive.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 18, 8:08 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Well, well - just a few short moments ago Houston seemed totally in control, driving confidently and burning time off the clock as they did so, but after that Denver touchdown everything has changed. Schaub looks nervous, hurried, as he throws incomplete on first down and then rushes the ball into the hands of Martin in the flats on third after Foster had been brought down for a loss on second. Jones is brought on to punt, and Denver will have it back at their 26.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 18, 6:00 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> The Houston defence is all at sea - blowing coverage on successive plays but getting away with it due to dropped catches from Tamme and Thomas. But on third down Manning goes back to Tamme on the crossing route, and he brings it in for a fresh set of downs at the Houston 40.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 18, 4:57 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Huge, huge penalty on Houston on fourth and 16 - Brice McCain flagged for illegal contact downfield just when the Texans appeared to have forced the stop. It was JJ Watt's sack of Manning which had put the Broncos in a hole in the first place, and whatever happens today he has certainly achieved his ambition of getting to Manning. In fact he now has 2.5 sacks on the day.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Touchdown? Texans 31 Broncos 18, 4:33 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Manning takes his shot, going over the top of Johnathan Joseph to Demayrius Thomas streaking through the end zone. The officials signal it as a touchdown, but as a scoring play it will be automatically reviewed, and on the replays it is clear that Thomas did not get his second foot down in-bounds. This should be overturned, and that decision is not going to go down well with the fans in Denver.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>No touchdown. Texans 31 Broncos 18, 4:33 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> As expected, the score is overturned. As expected, there are boos. It will be third and one on the Houston 31.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! Texans 31 Broncos 25, 3:00 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Oh my. From a position of total authority, the Texans are on the verge of blowing this game - a pass interference penalty against Jackson bringing Denver all the way down to the goalline and setting up the eventual score. Houston stuffed Lance Ball in the backfield on each of the next two plays, but on third down fate favoured the Broncos. Manning rifled a short pass in towards Decker, who could not hang on, but the ball skipped up off his fingers, over two defenders and into the hands of his team-mate Dreesen in the back of the end zone.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 25, 2:43 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Denver needed a quick stop, but they have not got it. Two runs to start the drive earned Houston five yards and obliged their hosts to burn their final time-outs, but on third and five Schaub delivered a dart to Andre Johnson running a short out to the left-hand touchline. A huge, huge play at a clutch moment.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>Two minute warning: Texans 31 Broncos 25</strong> That first down allows Houston to run the clock down to the TV time-out. \"Well, if you think punching bags is nerve racking.....what about not having Sunday Football as a Texas tradition in Luton North of London,\" writes self-professed 'true Texans fan' Anita Espino. \"It's 1:30am &amp; just have so much adrenalin that I can't even think of getting some shut-eye, knowing our Texans team are about to go 3 -0.....This night has been unbelievable, Thanks to you Paolo for the live updates!\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 25, 0:33 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Right then, here's the ballgame. Foster makes seven yards on three carries, meaning that the Texans will still have to punt the ball away with just over half a minute left on the clock.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 25, 0:20 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Decker - not the usual return man - comes in to field the punt and makes a poor decision to take it out of the end zone, costing his team both time and yards as he is tackled at the 14.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Texans 31 Broncos 25, 0:04 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Manning completes to Decker up to the 30-yard line, then spikes the ball. Last play coming up.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>Houston Win! Final score: Texans 31 Broncos 25</strong> Denver go looking for a miracle, Manning fizzing it out quickly to Decker who pitches it back to Thomas as they launch into a series of desperate laterals. But in the end, the effort is futile - Houston eventually forcing the fumble at halfway. Houston start their season 3-0 for the first time in franchise history, leaving them as the only unbeaten team in the AFC, the San Diego Chargers having lost to Atlanta this afternoon. Denver slip to 1-2.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>Round-up:</strong> Right, that's it from me. Thanks for reading and for all your emails and tweets. Sorry I couldn't use more of your athlete advert suggestions. Before I go, just a reminder to check back in tomorrow for our Five Things We Learned round-up blog. And in the meantime, here are the final scores from the rest of today's 4pm kick-offs. </p> <p>Arizona Cardinals 27 Philadelphia Eagles 6<br>Atlanta Falcons 27 San Diego Chargers 3<br>Pittsburgh Steelers 31 Oakland Raiders 31</p>"
