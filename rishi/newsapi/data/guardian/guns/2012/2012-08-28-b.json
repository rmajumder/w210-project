  "<p>Chelsea are considering making a final improved offer for Bayer Leverkusen's Germany international Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle ahead of the closure of the transfer window on Friday night in a move that, if successful, would take their summer outlay on new players close to \u00a3100m. The European champions have been lavish spenders in the market having already revamped their forward line with the additions of Eden Hazard (\u00a332m), Oscar (\u00a320m), Marko Marin (\u00a37m) and Victor Moses (\u00a39m). The Spanish right-back Cesar Azpilicueta has also signed from Marseille for around \u00a37m and, while that heavy recruitment has caught the eye, Roberto di Matteo has made no secret of the lack of central striker options should Fernando Torres suffer an injury at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>The likes of Edinson Cavani, Radamel Falcao and Hulk had all been considered only for their respective clubs to resist Chelsea's interest. Leverkusen have maintained Sch\u00fcrrle, too, is not available and have already rejected the London club's initial \u00a316m bid for his services. Yet, at 21, the versatile striker \u2013 who more normally operates wide but also potentially through the centre \u2013 fits Chelsea's criteria as they plan for the long-term to leave the Premier League club considering submitting a further bid before Friday's cut-off. Should that, too, be rejected they would aim to return when the market reopens.</p> <p>Chelsea's European Cup winning forward, Didier Drogba, visited Cobham on Tuesday while uncertainty surrounds his position at his new side, Shanghai Shenhua. The Chinese Premier League club's major shareholder and chairman, Zhu Jun, is seeking greater control having pumped more than \u00a360m into Shenhua in the last five-and-a-half years. If that control is not forthcoming, he is now threatening to contribute only 28.5% - matching his stake in the club \u2013 of the running costs, including players' salaries. Both Drogba and Nicolas Anelka earn close to \u00a3250,000-a-week in Shanghai.</p> <p>Regardless, the Ivorian could yet return to Cobham to train with his former Chelsea team-mates in November once the Chinese domestic season ends. There are six league games still to be played, the final round of matches due on 3 November, with Drogba \u2013 whose family are still based in Surrey \u2013 likely to seek to maintain his fitness ahead of his involvement with the Ivory Coast at the African Cup of Nations in the new year.</p>",
  "<p>\"It was my luck (perhaps my bad luck) to be the world chess champion during the critical years in which computers challenged, then surpassed, human chess players,\" wrote Garry Kasparov in The Chess Master and The Computer. \"Before 1994 and after 2004 these duels held little interest. The computers quickly went from too weak to too strong. But for a span of 10 years these contests were fascinating clashes between the computational power of the machines (and, lest we forget, the human wisdom of their programmers) and the intuition and knowledge of the grandmaster.\"</p> <p>Oscar Pistorius is used to questions. In fact, he likes to encourage people to ask them. \"When I am at home I sometimes go to the shopping centre to get groceries after training in the evening, still in my athletics pants,\" he says. \"And I will see a kid staring at my legs, and immediately the parent will turn the child away and say 'don't stare, don't stare.'\" He understands why people react that way. They have, he says, been doing it for decades. But it still annoys him.</p> <p>\"That child has no preconceptions, no appreciation of the idea of disability, and all of a sudden they are learning to think 'OK this is something we don't do, something we don't talk about.' It forms a negative association,\" Pistorius explains. \"So I go up to that parent and child and I say 'Hi, my name is Oscar, and these are my cool prosthetic legs.'\" Usually he tells them that his other ones \"got bitten off by a shark\", unless, he adds with a sly grin, \"the mother is beautiful, then I tell them it happened because I didn't eat my vegetables. Then I always get a good thumbs up from her.\"</p> <p>It is not the everyday questions Pistorius is tired of, but the hypothetical ones. His career poses plenty of those too: Is Pistorius the first of many Paralympians who will be able to run, jump, and throw to a level that makes them able to compete in the Olympics? Or is he a one-off?</p> <p>In 1985, Garry Kasparov was able to play 32 simultaneous matches against the world's best chess computers and win every one. Twelve years later he lost his match against IBM's supercomputer Deep Blue. \"Today,\" Kasparov has written, \"for $50 you can buy a home PC program that will crush most grandmasters.\" That transition took a little less than 20 years.</p> <p>At the Olympics, 400m gold medallist, Kirani James, finished 15 places ahead of Pistorius, in a time that was 1.06sec quicker than Pistorius' personal best. In 20 years' time, however, will the Olympic champion still be so far ahead of Pistorius' own successors? Will technology have narrowed the gap, or even made it disappear altogether?</p> <p>That, funnily enough, was exactly the same leap forward that Pistorius mentioned in his pre-Paralympic press conference. \"Now,\" he said, \"the new debate in Paralympics is about developments in prosthetics: 'Do you think that in 20 years\u2026?'\" Pistorius is not interested in that question. He has spent too much time fighting to be able to use his own Cheetah running blades to worry about a future that does not affect him. \"Ultimately that doesn't matter,\" he says. \"The prosthetic leg that we have is the one that is deemed to be fair. I am not and I am sure a lot of my competitors aren't looking to make the improvements through technology. They are happy with what we have.\"</p> <p>Pistorius shies away from that question because he does not want people to make the mistake of thinking it is the technology that made him capable of running as fast as he does. He has spent enough time, energy, and money fighting that battle already, in press conferences, laboratories, and courtrooms across South Africa, Europe, and the USA. He rightly argues that his speed comes from a combination of dedication, professionalism, and talent. \"Paralympic athletes have been able to run in state and national events I have just been hard working and talented enough to compete on an international level,\" he says. \"It's not that I've done it to open the doors, the doors have always been open.\"</p> <p>That is not quite true. In March 2007, he ran the 400m in a new personal best of 46.56sec. Had it been almost any other runner, no one would have noticed. Because it was Pistorius the performance sent ripples all around the athletics world. Two weeks later the sport's governing body, the IAAF, introduced a special amendment to rule 144-2(e), prohibiting the use of \"any technical device that incorporates springs, wheels or any other element that provides the user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device.\" There were motivated by the fear that Pistorius could be setting a precedent. In November of that same year, the Cheetah blades Pistorius uses to run on were made illegal in able-bodied competition. It took him, and his lawyers, four months to overturn that decision.</p> <p>\"As far as my prosthetic leg goes, the model that I have used has been made since 1996,\" Pistorius says. \"That prosthetic leg has been tested. That is the one with which we went to the Court of Arbitration for Sports hearing with. So that prosthetic leg is allowed to be used by any amputee.\" In fact Pistorius is so committed to his principles that at these Games, his rivals are using more up-to-date technology. Pistorius still uses a standard model, but the manufacturer, Ossur, has started to tailor blades to the requirements of individual athletes and events, so there is one set designed for running the bend, another for the straight, and another again for the long jump.</p> <p>The International Paralympic Committee, who must decide what technology is and is not permissible for use, has to ratify such advances. They are guided by the principle that all technology must be universally available and, crucially, must ensure that \"human performance is the critical endeavour not the impact of technology and equipment\". That, though, can be a hard line to draw.</p> <p>In coming years the IPC's technical committee can expect to be very busy indeed. Advances in prosthetic limb technology have been accelerated by the research and development done to improve the lives of amputees returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. The US military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been running a Revolutionizing Prosthetics program since&#xa0;2006.</p> <p>\"The vision for the programme was to restore as much natural limb function as possible,\" explains Colonel Geoffrey Ling, the programme manager. Under Ling's guidance, DARPA has developed technology which enables \"direct brain-control-of-prostheses experiments with spinal-cord-injured patients\". They have been developing powered limbs, which can be controlled by thought.</p> <p>Richard Hirons, a clinical specialist who works for Ossur, says that \"In the normal arena of rehabilitation for amputees, the concept of replacing lost muscles, of providing powered prosthetics, isn't outrageous, it is fair. It is replacing like with like.\" Pistorius, Hirons explains, is essentially just using a \"simple curved piece of carbon fibre\" to run on. In the near future, however, the IPC will have to start making rulings on the legality of more complex prosthetics, the offsprings of those being developed now in DARPA's laboratories. Hirons describes it as \"augmented sport\".</p> <p>Hirons admits that now \"we are knocking on the door now in terms of exploring that technology for regular use, but as a concept I always say there is nothing to stop your imagination turning it up to 11 and saying 'can we better than the able-bodied at sport?'\" The answer, as Kasparov will tell you, is surely yes. It is simply a question of how long it will&#xa0;take.</p>",
  "<p>Three ads trumpeting the high welfare standards of pork sold with the Red Tractor quality mark have been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which found the claims could mislead consumers into thinking pig welfare in Britain was better than it is.</p> <p>\"This is a victory for consumers, who deserve to be able to choose higher welfare meat without being misled,\" said Joyce D'Silva from campaign group Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), which made the complaint.</p> <p>\"Claims of high welfare are clearly a lucrative marketing tool but in this case they were overblown and misleading to the consumer.</p> <p>\"The 'pork not porkies' claim on the advert makes this a particularly embarrassing own-goal for Red Tractor pork.</p> <p>\"This is also a victory for those pig farmers in the UK who adhere to higher welfare standards like the Soil Association's organic standard or the RSPCA's Freedom Food.\"</p> <p>Most British farms are members of the Red Tractor scheme, a label of the Assured Food Standards scheme, accounting for 40% of pork sold on UK shelves.</p> <p>The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board told ASA the three ads it commissioned were intended to compare the welfare standards of Britain and pork imported from many EU countries, where sow stalls are still in use despite an imminent EU ban and castration is still common practice.</p> <p>The ASA said that this comparison was unclear and that consumers could interpret the ads as championing the general level of pig welfare in the UK.</p> <p>\"We considered that the claim implied that there were no concerns about the welfare of pigs in the UK, whereas some areas were unlikely to be regarded as 'high' welfare,\" it said in its adjudication.</p> <p>CIWF has said it is particularly concerned by the scheme's guidelines on the use of slatted flooring and farrowing crates for sows.</p> <p>D'Silva said: \"The Red Tractor labelling scheme for pork does not guarantee high welfare and we are delighted that the ASA agrees with us that the claim was misleading.\"</p> <p>In a statement, the RSPCA said that although some Red Tractor farms went \"well above\" the basic scheme requirements, others were failing to meet all the animals' needs.</p> <p>But it added: \"Under the Red Tractor scheme pigs can be kept on bare concrete or slatted floors with no comfortable bedding or suitable materials such as straw to root around in \u2013 not conditions which the RSPCA, and many shoppers, would equate with 'high welfare'.\"</p> <p>The ASA found that Red Tractor made efforts to control the use of these methods, and that it set stringent standards for their farms with spot checks and inspections.</p> <p>It also pointed out that, due to differences such as a ban on sow stalls in place in the UK since 1999, \"the quality of pig welfare in the UK was high in comparison with the welfare of pigs in many European countries.\"</p> <p>In a statement, Red Tractor said animal welfare was at the core of its standards.</p> <p>\"We are pleased that the ASA ruling accepts that Red Tractor pork is produced to higher standards than the EU legislation that underpins pork production in the rest of Europe, but we are slightly disappointed that the ASA felt that this obvious point of reference should have been made more explicit in the adverts.</p> <p>\"The fact is that much of the imported pork that we see on shelves is produced in systems that would be illegal in the UK, let alone below Red Tractor standards.</p> <p>\"Even changes to EU pig welfare regulations that come into effect from January 2013 still won't be on par with the Red Tractor standards.\"</p> <p>BPEX, a division of the AHDB, said it accepted the ASA's ruling on what it considered \"a small technicality\".</p> <p>Director Mick Sloyan said: \"We will continue to promote the independently audited standards behind Red Tractor pork and pork products, including welfare, in a way that is absolutely clear to consumers.\"</p>",
  "<p>Unhappy Republican delegates have staged a rare revolt at the party's national convention in Tampa, noisily protesting against rules changes they claim crack down on grassroots supporters.</p> <p>The protesters accused the party leadership of steamrolling the changes through. They shouted \"object\", \"point of order\", \"division\", \"liberty\" and \"USA\" as John Boehner, the House speaker, pressed ahead, ignoring them.</p> <p>Boehner claimed the rules had been passed by a voice vote in spite of the protests.</p> <p>The revolt was staged by delegates mainly from Texas and Maine, some of them supporters of the libertarian Ron Paul.</p> <p>One of the protesters, Phillip Payne, 33, owner of a land-surveying company and member of the Texas delegation, said: \"This is a power grab.\" </p> <p>Wearing a cowboy hat like his fellow Texan delegates, he blamed the party leadership in general rather than the presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \"It is a about principle. It is not about Paul. It is a liberty issue,\" Payne said.</p> <p>\"This is going to disenfranchise a lot of enthusiastic grassroots people such as the Tea Party activists,\" he added.</p> <p>It is rare at modern conventions to have such revolts, given how carefully orchestrated they have become. They are especially rare for Republicans, who are usually highly disciplined.</p> <p>The protest reflects to some extent the split in the Republican Party between the old establishment and the relatively new Tea Party activists and the libertarians gathered round Paul.</p> <p>In a further sign of the continuing trouble Paul and his supporters pose for Romney and the Republican leadership, the delegations from Minnesota, Nevada and Iowa announced on the convention floor that they were voting for the Texas congressman, even though he failed to win those or any other states during the primary and caucus process.</p> <p>This was possible because Paul's extensive grassroots network was able to dominate congressional district and state conventions in these states and elsewhere. </p> <p>It is this sort of under-the-radar delegate strategy that the Republican leadership wanted to stop by changing the party's rules, to the fury of some delegates. </p> <p>They objected to a change to Rule 12 that would allow Republican leaders to make changes to party rules between conventions. Until now, changes could usually only be made at conventions. </p> <p>The other objection was to Rule 16 that would require states to allocate delegates according to the statewide vote rather than a winner-take-all approach. This is aimed at states such as Maine where Paul supporters are accused of taking over the nominating process, allocating 20 of the 24 delegates to Paul.</p> <p>As part of the revolt, protesters attempted to gather the 29 signatures needed from members of the party rules committee. This would have allowed minority reports objecting to the rules changes to be heard on the floor. But the protesters failed to secure the necessary signatures.</p> <p>One of the minority reports objecting to the changes came from the Texas delegation.</p> <p>Melinda Fredericks, 52, is a member of the Texas delegation but also a member of the rules committee. She had supported the Texas minority report.</p> <p>She expressed sorrow that the changes had gone through. \"I am not happy about it,\" she said. \"I have conflicting feelings.\" She was disappointed there had not been enough notice to allow time to discuss it with her delegation.</p> <p>She added, however, that the Texas delegation had secured some concessions. The leadership power to make changes between conventions would only apply up until 2014 and not the next convention in 2016.</p> <p>But the Texans were not united in protest. Some resented the public display of protest. Jan Koehne, 71, a rancher and gun seller, said some of the protesters were not active members of the party, rarely taking part in the state conventions, and did not understand that decisions were reached gradually.</p>",
  "<p>Spain's attempts to stave off a full bailout were dealt a blow on Tuesday when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.97bn) from a central government rescue fund.</p> <p>It came as figures showed Spanish banks saw \u20ac1 withdrawn for every \u20ac20 deposited in July \u2013 making it the worst month for deposit flight in 15 years \u2013 and Spain's statistics institute revealed the recession was worse than thought, with the economy shrinking at an annual rate of 1.3% in the second quarter.</p> <p>Catalonia is one of half a dozen regional governments shut out of markets and needing government help to roll over debt and fund budget deficits. Regions have a combined debt of \u20ac145bn, with \u20ac36bn needing to be refinanced this year.</p> <p>Prime minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government may eventually take direct control of the region's finances. But regional prime minister Artur Mas, of the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, has threatened a snap election if that happens. His spokesman, Francesc Homs, rejected any \"political terms\" for borrowing the money.</p> <p>A report by the Fedea thinktank predicts Catalonia, which accounts for one fifth of the economy, will miss the 1.5% deficit target set this year, with an expected 2.5% deficit making it the second-worst performing region. Revised figures showed the Spanish recession started three months earlier than previously indicated. \"The data shows the recession started in the third quarter of last year,\" secretary of state for the economy, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez, admitted.</p> <p>\"The downturn in the Spanish economy is deeper than previously thought and accelerating,\" warned Robert O'Daly of the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p> <p>Unemployment is already at 25% but the speed at which jobs are disappearing quickened to an average rate of 800,000 jobs a year in the second quarter, according to the statistics institute.</p> <p>European council president Herman Van Rompuy said on Tuesday it was up to Spain to decide whether to seek eurozone help, after meeting Rajoy in Madrid. Rajoy repeated that he needed more details from the European Central Bank to help him decide.</p> <p>Sources at the Bank of Spain claimed the sudden drop in deposits was mostly due to banks withdrawing money placed with other entities, but the fall came amid growing consumer anger with retail banks. Tens of thousands of small savers are set to be hit with losses on preference shares they bought in former savings banks that now need bailing out by the eurozone's rescue fund.</p> <p>Spanish banks can take up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a379.7bn) from the fund, but preference shareholders must first bear losses of up to 80%. Many savers who bought the shares thought they were risk-free deposits from high street banks.</p> <p>Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, abruptly withdrew from delivering a speech in the US next weekend, citing pressure of work as he prepares two important moves on the euro crisis.</p> <p>Draghi was due to speak at the annual economic policymaking elite gathering at Jackson Hole in Wyoming on Saturday before an audience of global central bankers. But he is preparing to unveil controversial moves next week aimed at pushing down the costs of borrowing for Spain and Italy by launching ECB bond-buying interventions in the financial markets, a policy bitterly criticised by Germany's powerful Bundesbank.</p> <p>Draghi is also engaged in behind-the-scenes politicking over the shape and powers of a new eurozone bank supervision authority. A few days after Draghi announces the bond-buying policy, following an ECB governing council meeting next week, the European commission is to deliver proposals for the new eurozone bank regulator, calling for the ECB to be given extensive new powers as the key supervisory authority.</p> <p>J\u00f6rg Asmussen, the German member of the ECB's six-strong executive who has co-drafted the bond-buying scheme for Draghi, disclosed on Monday some of the conditions required to trigger ECB action.</p> <p>The ECB will intervene in the secondary markets to buy bonds with short maturities, he said, but only if the eurozone's bailout funds first became active in the primary markets \u2013 in other words directly buying up distressed government bonds.</p> <p>That introduces a strong element of politics and likely delays since eurozone governments and finance ministers will need to decide to use the bailout funds before ECB action is triggered.</p> <p>Any country benefiting from the bond-buying would need to request a bailout and succumb to eurozone terms, situations that Rajoy and his Italian counterpart, Mario Monti, are anxious to avoid.</p> <p>Asmussen also made clear the ECB was keen to be granted the new banking supervisory powers, but warned the commission in Brussels it would only take on the role on its terms.</p> <p>\"The ECB is ready to accept this responsibility, but under certain conditions,\" he said. \"The ECB has to be given all the instruments needed to carry out the tasks of bank supervision effectively. In particular, that means access to all the necessary information, intervention rights and the right to close down non-viable banks.</p> <p>\"Without these minimum tools, the ECB will not take on the responsibility. The risk to the reputation of the institution would be too &#xa0;great.\"</p>",
  "<p>A federal court has blocked an attempt by Texas to redraw its electoral maps after the US justice department said the move was intended to diminish the impact of the Latino vote. </p> <p>The US attorney general, Eric Holder, had described the proposed changes as part of a <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/104207242/Texas-v-Holder\">broader attack on civil rights </a>by states trying to roll back laws ensuring the right to vote using redistricting, voter identity card laws and other tactics.</p> <p>The issue may now end up before the US supreme court as part of a legal challenge by Texas and other states to voting rights legislation.</p> <p>The Republican-dominated Texas legislature last year redrew constituency boundaries to create new electoral districts after the latest census showed that the state's population grew by more than 4 million in a decade. That entitled Texas to four more members of Congress.</p> <p>Democrats said that the new electoral maps were manipulated to diminish the fact that minorities account for most of the population increase. Latino voters lean heavily toward voting Democrat while the boundaries were redrawn to ensure the additional seats would be won by Republicans.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/30/us-attorney-general-minority-voting-rights\">In May, Holder said</a> that in Texas \"electoral maps were manipulated to give the appearance of minority control while minimising minority electoral strength\".</p> <p>A Washington DC court on Tuesday agreed with the federal government that the new maps did not comply with the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a key piece of civil rights legislation designed to put an end to practices that deprived minorities of the ballot or diminished the effect of their votes.</p> <p>Texas is one of 16 states, mostly in the south, that under the act must obtain US justice department approval for changes to voting laws or procedures because of a history of racial discrimination.</p> <p>Trey Martinez Fischer, a Texas state legislator with the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, welcomed the ruling. \"This is absolutely a victory for Texas and for minority voters to elect a candidate of their choice,\" he said.</p> <p>The Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, said he will appeal against the decision to the US supreme court. \"Today's decision extends the Voting Rights Act beyond the limits intended by Congress and beyond the boundaries imposed by the constitution,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The attorney general's office will continue defending the maps enacted by the Texas legislature and will immediately take steps to appeal this flawed decision to the US supreme court.\"</p> <p>Texas and five other states have already asked the US supreme court to strike down the section of the voting rights act requiring permission from the justice department for changes to electoral law. The states argue that while the requirement once served \"a noble purpose\" it is now outdated and that its \"benefits have all but vanished\".</p> <p>The decision will not have an impact on November's elections, which were already to be conducted using interim maps drawn up by a federal court in San Antonio. But the legal fight will decide districting at future ballots.</p> <p>In May, Holder characterised the move by Texas as part of a broader attempt by a number of states to roll back civil rights era gains including requirements for voters to show photo identification at the ballot box which poorer people and minorities, who tend to vote Democrat, are less likely to have. </p> <p>\"Now unfortunately, electoral redistricting is far from the only area of concern in covered jurisdictions. The recent wave of changes to state-level voter identification laws also has presented a number of problems requiring the (justice) department's attention,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Barely a month since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/28/g4s-50m-hit-olympics-contract?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">private security firm G4S crashed and burned</a> in the runup to the London Olympics, we're back in outsourcing la-la land again. This time the battle is over the monopoly franchise to run passenger trains on Britain's most lucrative rail route, the west coast mainline.</p> <p>Ministers have given the 15-year contract to the privatised bus operator FirstGroup, with a licence to increase fares by up to 11% a year, reduce services, downgrade catering and close ticket offices. Richard Branson, whose Virgin Trains has had the franchise since the 90s, is crying foul, and on Tuesday launched a legal action to halt the handover.</p> <p>Labour wants MPs to be able to scrutinise the deal. But the transport secretary, Justine Greening, is determined to plough ahead regardless, potentially tying the hands of government for the next three parliaments. And the controversy follows uproar over plans for an average 6.2% rise in rail fares from January.</p> <p>Commuters now routinely spend 15% of their income travelling to work on what is now the most expensive rail network in Europe. No wonder coalition MPs are lobbying for some relief from the drive to load more of the costs on to passengers: it is now <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9479994/Planes-cheaper-than-trains-on-half-of-routes.html\" title=\"\">cheaper to fly on half the popular routes around Britain than travel by more environmentally friendly rail</a>.</p> <p>The heavily subsidised rail privateers, whose top five executives paid themselves an average of \u00a31m last year, are also supposed to cough up a bigger share. But there's little sign of that happening \u2013 and the west coast mainline deal helps explain why.</p> <p>Forget the special pleading by Branson, who's made over \u00a3200m from rail privatisation. Virgin's own record is poor. But his accusation that FirstGroup is gaming the system is widely shared by industry analysts and insiders.</p> <p>Greening claims FirstGroup offers the best deal for taxpayers. In reality it's based on heroic growth expectations of 10.6% a year and payments to government that are heavily loaded on to the contract's last few years. The company in fact has an incentive to dump the franchise as those payments come due, because they dwarf the cost of the bond penalty.</p> <p>If FirstGroup \u2013 which is walking away from the Great Western franchise \u2013 defaults, it wouldn't be the first time. That's what happened with Bermuda-based Sea Containers and National Express, who had the contract for the east coast mainline before the last government was forced to take it over. But by then, both ministers and corporate executives would likely be long gone.</p> <p>Nearly 20 years after John Major's disastrous privatisation, this is the reality of Britain's railway: a byword for bewildering fragmentation, unreliability and exorbitant cost \u2013 and a gigantic scam for siphoning off public money into the pockets of monopoly contractors.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9476519/Richard-Branson-attacks-Government-insanity-after-Virgin-Trains-loses-West-Coast-rail-contract.html\" title=\"\">Branson has raged at the government's \"insanity\"</a> in awarding the west coast mainline franchise to FirstGroup. But it is the system itself that is irrational. Privatisation was supposed to cut public subsidy by boosting competition, investment and innovation.</p> <p>In fact, it has done the opposite. Government funding has at least doubled in real terms, while fares have also increased, largely because of privatisation \u2013 including the costs of fragmentation and duplication; dividend payments to investors; contractors' profit margins; debt write-offs; and higher interest payments to keep Network Rail's debts off the government's balance sheet.</p> <p>Taken together, those privatisation costs amount to around \u00a31.2bn a year, according to a new thinktank report (<a href=\"http://www.transportforqualityoflife.com/u/files/120630_Rebuilding_Rail_Final_Report_print_version.pdf\" title=\"\">Transport for Quality of Life's Rebuilding Rail</a>), while genuine private investment is estimated at barely 1% of the total funding of the railway. It's hardly surprising that the mainly publicly owned rail systems in the rest of Europe \u2013 several of which now run bits of Britain's privatised rail \u2013 are cheaper.</p> <p>The solution could not be more obvious. It's to rebuild a publicly owned and integrated railway. That can be done at zero or minimal cost, by bringing back each franchise into public ownership as the contracts expire. Freight apart, it can also be done under EU law, and with built-in local control. And saving the \u00a31.2bn-a-year costs of privatisation over time would be the equivalent of an across-the-board cut in fares of 18%.</p> <p>Rail renationalisation has long commanded large majorities in opinion polls. So you might imagine politicians would fall over themselves to sign up to a policy that's popular and saves money. The fact that they don't says something about the continuing grip of discredited ideology and corporate interests on Britain's political culture. Even a respected public transport pressure group like the Campaign for Better Transport, which now relies on funding from privatised transport companies, shies away from campaigning on the issue.</p> <p>Labour is at last inching in the right direction. Its transport spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/30/labour-railway-network-state-control\" title=\"\">Maria Eagle has floated the possibility of extending public ownership to rail</a> services, and this week called for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/27/east-coast-mainline-remain-public-labour/print\" title=\"\">east coast mainline to be kept in public hands</a>. But with Tory defence secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/philip-hammond-light-privatisation-government\" title=\"\">Phillip Hammond declaring the Olympics has changed his mind about privatisation</a> and Liberal Democrat Vince Cable pressing the case for the outright nationalisation of banks, Ed Miliband can afford to be a bit braver.

Perpetuating the myth that her death was a tragic accident, the judge did not deviate from the official line. He found that the driver had not seen the peace activist in her high-visibility jacket. He found a military investigation which drew the ire even of the US ambassador (the investigators initially assigned were 19 years old; they repeatedly failed to take statements from witnesses, follow up discrepancies or even issue maps of the scene) both credible and thorough. Impunity prevailed, once again, over accountability.</p> <p>Rachel Corrie died trying to protect a Palestinian home from demolition [see footnote]. At the time the Israeli military had demolished <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/rachel-corrie-verdict-exposes-israeli-military-mindset\" title=\"\">1,700 homes in Rafah</a>, which human rights groups claimed was collective punishment for the Palestinian suicide bombings. It was the height of the second intifada, or uprising. Tuesday's verdict did not merely spruce up the whitewash over Corrie's death. It spread it yet further. It said that, because the bulldozer was part of a \"combat operation\", no civilians \u2013 Palestinian or American \u2013 in the area had any rights, because they should not have been there. Corrie was, in the court's eyes, a human shield protecting terrorists.</p> <p>She was not the only casualty. Three years into the intifada, more than 400 children had been killed by the Israeli army, many in circumstances where there was no combat. As the family of Rachel Corrie are the first to admit, Gazan families who have lost their children have had no opportunity of taking legal action against Israel. Even if they had the means to do so, the law has been amended to stop civil actions like the one the Corries mounted. To redress repeated rulings by the supreme court which narrowed the definition of combat activity, the Knesset passed <a href=\"http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/ResearchAndPrograms/NationalSecurityandDemocracy/Terrorism_and_Democracy/Newsletters/Pages/43/3/3.aspx\" title=\"\">an amendment</a> to the law on compensation claims which widened it. No residents of an area, such as Gaza, that Israel deems enemy territory will be able to submit such a claim. So the limited form of legal redress available to the Corries as a civil lawsuit has now been ended.</p> <p>In the last nine years, Cindy and Craig Corrie have been fighting for something that any parent who has lost their child has a right to \u2013 the truth. Revealing the truth about the death of their daughter would have cost the IDF dearly. But covering it up costs Israel more as, with each year of the occupation, it sheds international support. Rachel Corrie, Tom Hurndall, Brian Avery, Caoimhe Butterly \u2013 all killed or severely injured while bearing witness to what happens to civilians in Israel's combat zones \u2013 leave a stain no court can erase.</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 25 February 2013. Rachel Corrie was killed in Gaza in March 2003 while protesting against the demolition of Palestinian homes. In August 2012 an Israeli court accepted that no homes were under threat of destruction on the day Corrie died: the IDF said its bulldozers were only clearing vegetation and explosives. The home in front of which Corrie was standing when she died was demolished in January 2004.</p>",
  "<p>Ivan Dodig, who had to sleep rough in his early days on the tennis circuit, retains a street hunger that Andy Murray will respect when they meet in the second round of the US Open on Thursday.</p> <p>\"Ivan went through stuff like that,\" the Scot from a down-to-earth background said of the Croat's hardships when he was trying to break into the mainstream of their sport. \"He slept under bridges, in train stations and all sorts when he was younger because he didn't have enough money. Eventually people break through because they are hungry and don't have anything else to fall back on.\"</p> <p>Medjugorje, a magical town near the Croatian border in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is famous for more than being Dodig's birthplace. When Ivan was four, the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to six young children there and thousands of Catholics from all over the world have visited it every year since then, in the expectation of another sighting. Whether the spirituality has touched him or not, Dodig has a serene air about him and voices his tennis philosophy with conviction.</p> <p>\"We are all human beings,\" he says, \"we all have a chance. If you go on court with that thought, you can beat anyone. Of course it's going to be tough, but I have to focus on my own game. I have to risk a lot and hope that everything goes in.</p> <p>\"I have had experience against top 10 players. I beat [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga on grass and [Robin] Soderling. So we will see. I like to play these matches.\"</p> <p>His biggest win was over Rafael Nadal in Canada in 2011. The mystery about him is not his anonymity (he was keen after a quick win over Hiroki Moriya on day one to go to the main interview room rather than one of the smaller ones reserved for lesser-known players) but the fact that his obvious talents have not brought him more success.</p> <p>Dodig, who is 27, lives in considerably enhanced circumstances now, in Zagreb, although he has rarely transferred the belief of others into anything more tangible than kind words and a pat on the back, as his world place of 118 shows. He puts his recent tumble in the rankings down to a back injury, but says he is fit and training properly again.</p> <p>As Murray recognises, Dodig has a desire driven by tantalising proximity to money and fame. After eight years as a pro he has earned $1.3m, which is about a 20th of Murray's prize money, and, spread across all those years, not as big a bonanza as it might sound.</p> <p>\"I could be wrong,\" Murray said on Tuesday night, \"but I think [Marin] Cilic [also a native of Medjugorje] helped sponsor him. Not everyone has the backing of a rich federation to help them travel and get coaching, and he was maybe an excellent athlete who didn't understand the game that well. Sometimes things just click \u2013 and guys are definitely coming through much older than they did.\"</p> <p>Murray looked a lot better towards the end of his first-round win over Alex Bogomolov Jr than he did in a splintered start, although he was more comfortable with his performance than some of his critics. \"I just didn't serve at all well [in the first set] so I will be on the practice courts working on that. From one end, the sun was right in your eyes early on, so you could choose to take something off [the serve] and just get it in, but that wasn't working so I went for more on the serve and made more errors. I will make sure I don't serve like that against Dodig.</p> <p>\"He's a big guy. He serve and volleys a lot, especially on his first serve. You don't see that much. He's a very good athlete, He moves really well. On a hard court he can pretty much do the splits. He's very flexible and a tough guy to play against because he's unorthodox.</p> <p>\"He gets further and further back and can get pushed around a little bit. Maybe he's the one who has to do more running, so that will be one of the plans, to keep him on the move.\"</p> <p>Away from the court, Murray has been taken aback by the increased interest in him since he beat Roger Federer to win Olympic gold in London. \"I had a cameraman \u2013 I have no idea who he was working for \u2013 waiting outside the hotel the other day. At first he congratulated me on the gold medal and then asked me whether I had seen the pictures of Prince Harry yet and what I thought of the crown jewels.</p> <p>\"I am not used to having people hanging about outside my hotel in New York. I actually did say 'no comment'. That was my answer and then I ran away.\"</p> <p>There will be nowhere to hide in the second round, for either player, but Murray would have to play pretty badly to lose to Dodig, whatever his moving back story.</p>",
  "<p>Adam Johnson and Steven Fletcher may have cost a combined \u00a324m but James McClean is not the shy, retiring, type and he simply refused to be eclipsed by his expensive new team-mates.</p> <p>McClean's two goals, both created by the impressive Johnson incidentally, ensured Sunderland a safe passage into the third round against a Morecambe side whose slick passing cameos at times belied their League Two status.</p> <p>\"I thought Morecambe played very well,\" said the Sunderland manager Martin O\"Neill. \"But Adam Johnson was outstanding, he was terrific, he's an excellent player. I was pleased with Steven Fletcher too. I'm excited.\"</p> <p>A dry, hazily sunny, day on Wearside ensured that the drainage problems which had caused Sunderland's freshly laid pitch to become waterlogged in the face of persistent but hardly torrential rain last Saturday did not re-occur.</p> <p>Informed partly by the knowledge that Morecambe had won away at Blackpool in the previous round, O'Neill's line up was close to his strongest available XI. Equally importantly, it also permitted Johnson and Fletcher to get their debuts over with.</p> <p>If Fletcher's performance at times reminded everyone that an ankle injury has restricted the former Wolves centre forward to little more than a few days full training this summer, Johnson swiftly made his presence felt.</p> <p>Deployed in a flexible right-sided role which promises to make Sunderland considerably more fluid, the former Manchester City winger asked Morecambe a barrage of awkward questions and, appropriately enough, it was a Johnson corner which finally prompted a breakthrough.</p> <p>The new boy's left footed, in-swinger from the right picked out McClean at the near post and the winger unearthed from the reserves by O'Neill last December directed a glancing header beyond Morecambe's Barry Roche.</p> <p>With Andrew Wright proving stubbornly effective in a quasi-sweeping role in front of the visiting defence, Morecambe creditably refused to surrender. Sunderland's Jack Colback was required to excel out of position at left-back and home fans were treated to the depressing, if not entirely unfamiliar sight, of Lee Cattermole being booked \u2013 for a foul on Gary McDonald \u2013 before McClean cut a more inspiring pose.</p> <p>Exhibiting splendid close control, he received possession from Johnson about 20 yards out, dodged a couple of markers and, advancing, defied Roche, courtesy of a fine angled shot.</p> <p>At least Jim Bentley, Morecambe's manager, had the consolation of seeing Louis Saha \u2013 \"a hero of mine\" \u2013 subsequently step off Sunderland's bench. \"It's nice to pit our wits against the best,\" said Bentley.</p>",
  "<p>The Rolling Stones are recording in France, according to a tweet by Mick Jagger.</p> <p>\"Had fun in the Paris studio this week!\" Jagger wrote on Thursday.

  "<p>Families of several of the 70 people killed or injured in the Aurora shooting in Colorado have launched an impassioned attack on local bureaucrats who they say have denied them a voice over the $5m relief fund raised after the tragedy.</p> <p>Family members of 11 of the 12 who died in the shooting on 20 July joined relatives of some of the injured at a news conference in which they disclosed increasingly rancorous relations between them and local organisations purporting to help them. They complained that although the funds had been raised to support victims and their families, they had been entirely cut out of decision-making process over how the money should be used.</p> <p>Tom Teves, father of Alex Teves, 24, who died during the rampage at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises at the Century 16 theater in Aurora, read out a statement on behalf of the group. It said that not a single victim was represented on the 24-strong board of the 7/20 Recovery Committee that had been set up to disburse the funds.</p> <p>\"We are certain that everyone who donated intended that their money goes directly to the victims. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case,\" Teves said.</p> <p>He had particularly harsh words for the governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, who set up the <a href=\"http://www.communityfirstfoundation.org/aurora-victim-relief-fund.cfm\">Aurora Victim Relief Fund</a> in partnership with local groups. \"You came and you grieved with our families. We allowed you into our family circles at the worst time in our lives. You pledged to stand by the families, but are you a man of your word?\" Teves said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.communityfirstfoundation.org/news_press_releases.cfm\">So far the relief fund has handed out $350,000</a> of the $5m in lump sums of $5,000 to families of the dead or to those injured. But the families are angered that the money is being disbursed indirectly, with no direct involvement for them.</p> <p>The website of the fund states explicitly that \"it does not make grants directly to individuals, but to non-profit organizations offering assistance to those individuals\".</p> <p>When Teves protested that the families wanted a robust voice over how the funds were allocated, he said he was told that they should start their own money-raising charity.</p> <p>Tuesday's press conference was the first time that the Aurora families have spoken out since the massacre, other than sparse individual comments at the time of the shooting. They made no comment on gun laws or any security failings that might have contributed to the disaster, though Teves hinted that he might talk about such subjects on a separate occasion.</p> <p>The families were palpably distressed when they were asked by a reporter why they needed the money. Several family members referred to ongoing treatment and medical bills.</p> <p>Melisa Cowden talked about the impact on her four children who had lost their father, Gordon Cowden, 51, in the tragedy. \"They will go through the rest of their lives without their dad \u2013 this is about their futures.\"</p> <p>Teves added: \"Nobody's going to get rich out of this. For the 12 of us [families of the dead] \u2013 there's not enough money in the federal government to make up what we've lost.\"</p>",
  "<p>Paralympic officials expect there to be more athletes with learning disabilities at the next Games in Rio in 2016, amid confidence that their reintroduction in London will proceed smoothly.</p> <p>But the International Paralympic Committee admits some athletes will always try and cheat the classification system that underpins the Games, most often described as being similar to the weight classification system in boxing that ensures rivals are equally matched.</p> <p>Each of the 4,200 athletes competing are classified according to the impact of their particular impairment on their sport and grouped into categories to ensure competition is fair.</p> <p>There are 10 eligible impairments in each Paralympic sport, but only swimming and athletics field events in all 10.</p> <p>The IPC and Paralympics broadcaster Channel 4, which has developed a new graphics system called Lexi to explain the classification system, are keen to make it as transparent and easy to understand as possible.</p> <p>Over the years, the classification has shifted from medical diagnoses to a so-called \"function based\" system, so tests are based on the limitations an impairment causes in a particular sport.</p> <p>Based on a system laid down by the IPC, each sport classifies its own athletes. And during the Games themselves a team of about 80 classifiers will work to observe the field of play to ensure that athletes are in the right category.</p> <p>The classification can be challenged, either by the athlete themselves or by opponents who feel a rival may be taking part in the wrong class. At every Paralympics there are controversies and heartache when a handful of athletes are reclassified retrospectively.</p> <p>In Beijing, there were classification concerns over 700 of the 4,000 athletes taking part and about 90% were reclassifed before the Games. Many of those reclassifications would have been due to conditions getting worse or better over time, rather than evidence of deception.</p> <p>For London, there are still 300 classifications outstanding ahead of the Games.</p> <p>Dr Anne Hart, chair of the IPC classification committee, said some athletes would always be tempted to cheat the system. \"The chances of that happening are always out there. There is an athlete who might slip through at some point, but ultimately they seem to get caught. I've probably made a mistake or two in classifying, just like a referee might make a mistake. I can't say our system is 100% accurate every time,\" she said.</p> <p>She said that while it was possible that athletes would try and cheat testers, it was becoming increasingly difficult \u2013 particularly because athletes continued to be observed during play.</p> <p>\"The systems have improved and have become much more comprehensive. The athlete is tested in a situation where it may be possible they don't give their best effort,\" said Hart. \"But it's not the only test that's done. During the actual sports activity, there'll be something that doesn't fit and at that point the classifiers will reassess the athlete. Most of the time we'll catch that.\"</p> <p>There will be a particular spotlight on the 120 athletes with learning disabilities at the London Games, competing for the first time in 12 years in athletics, swimming and table tennis.</p> <p>It is the first time athletes with learning disabilities have been allowed to compete since a scandal in Sydney in 2000. Following the successful introduction of the category in Atlanta in 1996, the IPC withdrew it after it emerged only two members of a 12-strong Spanish gold medal winning squad met the criteria. It was found that the procedure for classifying athletes was \"severely lacking\".</p> <p>A far more stringent testing criteria has been developed by Inas, the international federation for para-athletes with an intellectual disability. Through a system of nine tests, they determine that athletes have an IQ of less 75, have a \"significant deficit\" in terms of cognitive behaviour and suffered the impact when their brain was still developing at less than 18 years of age.</p> <p>Having determined their eligibility, athletes then undergo a series of sport specific tests to check the impact of their impairment on their particular sport.</p> <p>Learning disabilities can have an impact on reaction time, spacial awareness, memory, concentration and a range of other factors that impact differently depending on the sport.</p> <p>Professor Jan Burns, head of eligibility for Inas, said that one of the biggest challenges had been in ensuring the tests were consistently applied across the world. \"We have to balance between being as inclusive and encouraging as possible with being as rigorous as possible. We've engaged in a massive education programme across the world over the past two years. \"One of the big challenges for us is to try and get a consistent definition and a consistent approach,\" she said.</p> <h2><strong>Eligible impairments</strong><br></h2> <p>There are 10 eligible \"impairments\" in Paralympic sport, but only athletics and swimming include events for all of them. They are: impaired muscle power, impaired range of motion, leg length difference, limb deficiency, short stature, ataxia, athetosis, hypertonia, visual impairment and (for the first time since 1992) intellectual impairment.</p> <p>Each event is given a class. In athletics, for example, the T or F refers to track or field and the numbers refers to the athletes in that category, and their level of impairment. For example, the numbers 31-38 refer to athletes with cerebral palsy, with 31\u201334 using a wheelchair. Categories 51 to 58 are wheelchair racers or field athletes who don't suffer from cerebral palsy, and 40 to 46 refers to athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs, including amputees.</p> <p>There are 503 medal events in London, 30 more than in Beijing. But the IPC must balance off the desire to maintain the Games as the pinnacle of elite sporting competition with an aim to be as inclusive as possible in terms of the number of events and categories.</p>",

  "<p>Apple came close to destroying its business in the late 1980s by pursuing a suit against Microsoft claiming that Windows infringed the look and feel of the Mac desktop metaphor. Apple focused its hopes and business future on this lawsuit, while its market share dwindled. Rather than competing, it litigated. And lost.</p> <p>Last week, it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/28/apple-ban-samsung-phones-galaxy-s3\">litigated against Samsung over its iPhone design and won</a>.</p> <p>The first justifiable conclusion might be that big companies get their way. The second might reasonably be that Apple doesn't change much: its business model remains aggressive self-righteousness. The third is what everybody knows: patent rules and philosophy are all screwed up.</p> <p>As for the first point, Apple is not just a big company, but the biggest. And it is not just the biggest American company, but the <em>most</em> American company. It has entered a rarefied brand status in which it is now almost synonymous with American virtue: American as Apple. Its good design sense has become a major point of American pride, if not nationalism. The brand is a national asset. Apple is AT&amp;T in its pre-break-up from; it's GM, in its what's-good-for-General-Motors-is-good-for-the-country stage; it's United Fruit when it made US foreign policy; it's Microsoft when desktop computing was transforming the world.</p> <p>This is about as close to commercial omnipotence as it gets. Its unassailability, its right to be preternaturally aggressive, is built into its share price. We believe in Apple. So let us briefly consider the chance for a Korean company defending itself against (or, perish the thought, challenging) the greatest American company of the age in the eyes of an American jury.</p> <p>And then, there's the self-righteousness. Apple is one of the most aggressive intellectual property litigators of all time. Its major moves have not been about protecting precise technical innovations, but about claiming the much softer zone of look and feel. It sues for brand rather than engineering. It has pioneered a new modern sensibility: taste is what's most valuable; identity is king. It's sued about the lower case \"i\"; it's sued about the word \"pod\"; it's sued New York City over the \"big Apple\"; it's sued over using the words \"app store\".</p> <p>This fierce defensiveness might be rightly understood in a psychological sense: Apple itself is based on stolen iconography. There was first the Beatle's Apple and there was Xerox PARC's desktop design. Apple's self-righteousness masks its guilt. (It may be sheepish, too, about being more of a marketing organization than a technology company.) What's more, it knows better than anybody that if you relax your vigilance, somebody can easily walk off with what you've done \u2013 and improve it.</p> <p>And then, in the algebra of Samsung's loss and Apple's victory, there's patent hell. Or absurdity.</p> <p>Patents are, arguably, no longer a system of protection; they are a system of litigation. Great numbers of patents are now filed, in an over-burdened system, to protect not innovations but the right to litigate over innovations. Indeed, any patent of value will ultimately be litigated.</p> <p>What's more, as the system has become ever more over-taxed, as technology itself has become more complex, the ill-equipped and under-trained bureaucracy has increasingly taken to giving patents to wide-ranging abstractions. Design concepts, behavior adjustments, and new approaches to problem solving are all patentable innovations. The system itself assumes that litigation <em>is</em> the check on the system. Which means, fundamentally, that the litigant with the most resources and greatest status wins.</p> <p>But let us not argue the case that all this quite obviously impedes innovation and is part of a new unreal property land grab \u2013 not about technology at all, but about intellectual property: an effort to privatize much of what was once understood to be shared and public (indeed, <em>not</em> ownable, like the <em>shape</em> of the iPhone). But rather, for a moment, let's look at this as a form of hubris that has inevitable consequences.</p> <p>The Apple that has won against Samsung is the same Apple that lost against Microsoft. In other words, it is the kind of company that, through sheer willfulness, discipline, and perfectionism, can achieve brand hegemony of a singular type. But it is, too, the kind of company \u2013 the exact sort of company \u2013 that becomes, perhaps inevitably becomes, the bete noire of consumerists, regulators and, of course, most of all, its competitors.</p> <p>This is the story between the lines of its great victory and its further share price surge. On the one hand, there is this seemingly golden company. On the other hand, there is anybody with any sense of history knowing this is going to end badly.</p> <p>Companies that acquire the nation's imprimatur often, if not invariably, over-reach. It is a characteristic of American capitalism: the price of getting really big and overbearing is that you incur an inverse reaction. In the early 1990s, an ambitious department of justice (a Republican administration DOJ at that) commenced its assault on Microsoft. For better or worse, by the time the feds were finished, the company, with its rotten operating system, besieged and beleaguered, had become just one of many not-very-adept players in the space \u2013 an unimaginable outcome if you remember the once God-like power and scorched-earth wrath of Microsoft.</p> <p>Apple, and its rotten phone, have a ways to go. But karma should not be underestimated as a factor in this game.</p>",
  "<p>Human rights organisations have warned of a \"dangerous precedent\" following an Israeli court's dismissal of a civil lawsuit over the death of US activist Rachel Corrie, which stated that Israel could not be held responsible because its army was engaged in a combat operation.</p> <p>Corrie \"was accidentally killed in the framework of a 'war-related activity' ... [and] the state bears no responsibility for the damages inflicted on the plaintiffs resulting from a war-related action,\" said Judge Oded Gershon at Haifa district court.</p> <p>The 23-year-old activist was crushed by a military bulldozer which she believed was intent on demolishing a Palestinian home in Rafah, southern Gaza, in March 2003. Gershon ruled that it was a \"regrettable accident\" that Corrie had brought upon herself. There had been no fault in the internal Israeli military investigation, which cleared the bulldozer driver of any blame, the court found. \"The deceased was in a blind spot \u2013 the operator didn't see her,\" said Gershon.</p> <p>Corrie had \"put herself in a dangerous situation\" and could have saved herself by moving out of the zone of danger, he said. The area was \"the site of daily warfare\" and a closed military zone, and the US government had warned its citizens not to go there.</p> <p>Hussein Abu Hussein, the Corrie family's lawyer, said the ruling sent \"a very dangerous message and precedent that there are no restrictions on Israeli military behaviour in Gaza and the West Bank\". The ruling would \"close the doors of justice to civilian victims\", including foreigners, and \"expand a legal black hole\" in which Israel seeks to evade responsibility for its actions.</p> <p>The verdict, he said, was \"yet another example of where impunity has prevailed over accountability and fairness. We knew from the beginning that we had an uphill battle to get truthful answers and justice, but we are convinced that this verdict distorts the strong evidence presented in court, and contradicts fundamental principles of international law with regard to protection of human rights defenders. In denying justice in Rachel Corrie's killing, this verdict speaks to the systemic failure to hold the Israeli military accountable for continuing violations of basic human rights.\"</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said the ruling contravened international law, which is intended to protect non-combatants in war zones, and set \"a dangerous precedent\". \"The idea that there can be no fault for killing civilians in a combat operation flatly contradicts Israel's international legal obligations to spare civilians from harm during armed conflict and to credibly investigate and punish violations by its forces,\" said Bill van Esveld, a senior Middle East researcher at HRW.</p> <p>Shawan Jabarin, director of the Palestinian human rights organisation, Al Haq, said: \"Israel has claimed that it is not responsible for the death of a civilian in armed conflict. However, this flatly ignores international law, which stipulates that Israel is under an obligation to take all measures to ensure that no civilians will be harmed during hostilities, and must at all times distinguish between military targets and civilians.</p> <p>\"The presence of a civilian in a combat zone does in any way not affect their right to protection. Instead, their protected status applies regardless of their location in a conflict, and international law clearly states that they must be protected against acts of violence in all circumstances.\"</p> <p>Corrie's parents, Cindy and Craig, of Olympia, Washington State, sued the state of Israel, accusing it of the unlawful or intentional killing of their daughter or of gross negligence.</p> <p>The family was \"deeply saddened and deeply troubled\" by the ruling, Cindy Corrie said afterwards. \"I believe this was a bad day, not only for our family, but for human rights, humanity, the rule of law and also for the country of Israel.\" The state, she said, \"has worked extremely hard to make sure that the truth about what happened to my daughter is not known and those responsible will not be held accountable\". The family will appeal to the supreme court.</p> <p>The Israeli justice ministry described Corrie's death as \"a tragic accident\". The bulldozer driver and his commander were \"exonerated of any blame for negligence\", it said in a statement.</p> <p>At the time of Corrie's death, house demolitions were common; part of an increasing cycle of violence from both sides. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said the homes it targeted were harbouring militants or weapons or being used to conceal arms-smuggling tunnels under the border. Human rights groups said the demolitions were collective punishment. Between 2000 and 2004, the Israeli military demolished 1,700 homes in Rafah, leaving about 17,000 people homeless, according to the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem.</p> <p>Corrie was one of a group of around eight international activists acting as human shields against the demolitions. Fellow activists said she was clearly within the line of sight of the bulldozer driver, who drove straight at her.</p> <p>Israel promised a \"thorough, credible and transparent\" investigation into her death. Within a month, an IDF internal inquiry had concluded that the driver of the bulldozer had not seen the activist and that no charges would be brought.</p> <p>During the Corries' civil lawsuit, which lasted almost two and a half years, the bulldozer driver testified anonymously from behind a screen for \"security reasons\". He insisted that the first time he saw the activist was when he \"saw people pulling the body out from under the earth\".</p> <p>His commanding officer, Colonel Pinhas Zuaretz, told the court that Rafah was a war zone in 2003 and said that \"reasonable people would not be there unless they had aims of attacking our forces\".</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. There were times during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/24/england-south-africa-live?INTCMP=SRCH\">Friday's Cardiff rainwatch</a> that it was tempting to wonder whether this would become the first five-match ODI series to end 0-0. But the sun is shining, the weather is sweet at the Ageas Bowl today, and even Mystic Maisie, our fragrant Palms and Tea Leaves Editor, is predicting 100 overs. Woop woop! Come on, woop with me now.</p> <p>The match \u2013 or an unexpected thunderstorm or such ferocity as to threaten the space/time continuum and the world's most immovable toup\u00e9es, never mind our chances of getting 100 overs \u2013 will begin at <strong>1pm</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss and will bat first</strong>. That was a fairly straightforward decision on a surface that usually takes turn as the match progresses. The pitch is the reason England have broken the golden rule that you should never change a no-resulting team: Samit Patel comes in for Chris Woakes. That was a very late decision apparently. Poor Woakes. He waits a year for a recall and then gets dropped without facing, bowling or fielding a ball. Maybe his banter stinks or his armpits are unfunny or something. South Africa are unchanged.</p> <p><strong>England</strong> Cook (c), Bell, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Bresnan, Swann, Anderson, Finn.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Amla, Smith, Elgar, de Villiers (c/wk), Duminy, du Plessis, McLaren, Parnell, Peterson, M Morkel, Tsotsobe.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Lucky ground department</strong> Everybody's favourite Irish genius averages 137 in ODIs on this ground. That's not all. Alastair Cook averages 91 here, Ian Bell 87 and Craig Kieswetter 61. So when they all get first-ballers and England lose by 347 runs, you know whose house you should burn down: <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;ground=1184;template=results;type=batting\">Statsguru's</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>In a hilarious development</strong>, it's raining. Dear me. I'll never speak to Mystic Maisie again. It's pretty light, however, so we should still start on time.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.53pm</strong> Steve Pye has sent in his latest blog, <a href=\"http://that1980ssportsblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/1980s-commentary-moments.html\">which is about great commentary moments of the 1980s</a>. In the spirit of which, why not nominate your favourite piece of cricket commentary? (With a link if possible.) The less obvious the better, although<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsVTpX7LdZQ\"> the instant serotonin of Johnners and Aggers is inevitably our first port of call</a>. This also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqszcEWi5po\">does unspeakable things to the spine</a>.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Here comes the players</strong>. South Africa's opening pair in ODIs is Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla. If you think Amla is good in Tests, you should see his ODI record&#xa0;\u2013 his extraordinary average of 56.49 is <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=batting_average;qualmin1=5;qualval1=matches;template=results;type=batting\">the greatest in history among those from a Test-playing nation</a> who has played a minimum of five ODIs. (Ryan ten Doeschate is above Amla but, brilliant player though he is, most of his games are against Associate sides.) That said, I can confidently assert Amla won't score 311 not out today.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Smith 1, Amla 0)</strong> Jimmy Anderson starts with an excellent over that costs just one run. There is plenty of movement in the air, and Graeme Smith is beaten by a lovely awayswinger fourth ball. As Mike Atherton says on Sky, in a Test match Smith can leave those deliveries all day, but here he has to force the pace and go after the ball even if England hang it wide of off stump. The fifth ball is a fine inswinger that Smith drags for a single.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 3-0 (Smith 2, Amla 1)</strong> Steven Finn often starts with a very full length in ODIs, happy to invite the drive, but here he goes much shorter, jagging the ball back in to Hashim Amla. Two from the over.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv9HJga6Hjs\">This has always been one of my favourites</a>,\" says William Hardy. \"Maybe it's because, as a flighty, mentally weak opening bowler myself, I always felt for him, and less to do with Mark Nicholas.\" Mark Nicholas had a sensational Ashes series in 2005. It's sacrilege I know, given that Richie Benaud was commentating at the time, but part of me wishes Nicholas had been on for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;v=Hr-4F_SFWxA&amp;NR=1\">the final ball of the Edgbaston Test</a>. I wonder what he'd have come up with.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 7-0 (Smith 5, Amla 2)</strong> Amla takes a tight single to mid off but gets away with it because of a slip from Frank Spencer's Samit Patel. Smith is beaten again on the drive. He is walking miles across his stumps to Anderson, so far that you can sometimes see leg <em>and</em> a bit of middle before the ball is bowled. Anderson and Smith have had so many fascinating duels since they first met in the Natwest Series in 2003, <a href=\"http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/39210000/jpg/_39210096_anderson203.jpg\">a hot young thing with a dubious haircut</a> and an eerily mature 11-year-old who had just been made captain of South Africa.</p> <p>In other news, William Hardy is the only person bothering to email me at the moment \u2013 harumph \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.birdfolk.co.uk/cricalltv.php\">but it's no problem when he delivers gems like this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 8-0 (Smith 6, Amla 2)</strong> The sun has reappeared in Southampton. England's fine start continues with Finn angling one past Smith's outside edge and then having a shout for LBW turned down by Simon Taufel. There were doubts over height, line and where it pitched. That aside, as the old joke goes, it was close.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 11-0 (Smith 9, Amla 2)</strong> Anderson beats Smith again \u2013 does that thing have an outside edge \u2013 before being worked to leg, first for two and then for a quick single to Samit Patel. This has been a fine start from England. </p> <p>\"Why isn't Smith captain of SA?\" says Elliot Jacobs. I'm not certain, but presumably just to keep him fresh for Test cricket, and also to ease the eventual succession at Test level. It's a miracle that he has done the Test job for almost a decade&#xa0;\u2013 look at the average tenure of England Test captains \u2013 even before you consider he was one-day captain for eight years. His resilience and longevity are awe-inspiring really.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 15-0 (Smith 13, Amla 2)</strong> There's the first boundary of the innings from Smith, muscled to the left of mid off. Finn knocks the stumps down during his bowling action later in the over, although it's not called dead ball by Simon Taufel. Four from the over. Amla has only faced seven of the 36 balls thus far.</p> <p>\"I've a special fondness for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKXUT_W1SEQ\">Athers commentating on Ricky Ponting's early dismissal at Adelaide</a>,\" says David Hopkins. \"I think it's to do with his uncharacteristic bark of excitement, and the way it softly echoed my waking up the neighbours at gone midnight.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 23-0 (Smith 13, Amla 10)</strong> Hardly any emails so far today. Was it something I said? I didn't mean to hurt you, baby. Amla hits the field with a couple of drives off Anderson and then inside edges a filthy slap <em>just</em> past the stumps and away for four. He ends the over with a more deliberate boundary, pinged decisively over midwicket.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" nyzltdw6hgs\"\">Here is Richie Benaud explaining what to do when landing on the ball</a>,\" says Chris Bourne. \"No commentator gives better value with fewer words.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 33-0 (Smith 23, Amla 10)</strong> Smith was starting to look frustrated after three more dot balls but gets some oxygen by crunching a rare poor delivery from Finn off the pads and through midwicket for four. He gets four more off the last ball, whapping a low full toss to the trusty midwicket boundary. Ten from the over and 18 from the last two.</p> <p>\"Richie's world-weary 'That's got to be rock bottom for Rick McCosker' (Old Trafford 77? Couldn't find it on YouTube/Robelinda) summed it up,\" says Jon Salisbury. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlVbqnAZB1w#t=29m40s\">Richie's disgust here is a thing of beauty</a>.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 47-0 (Smith 32, Amla 15)</strong> Bresnan replaces Anderson and is edged right through second slip for four by Graeme Smith. There are 14 from the over in total, with Smith savaging a cut into the ground and up over Morgan at point for four more. Another snick through the slips, this time from Amla, brings another boundary. Sir Ian Botham isn't entirely impressed. After making 15 from the first six overs, South Africa have blootered 31 from the last three. </p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" ehv30ozq_ls\"\">What is amazing about this clip</a> is how David Gower completely regains his composure,\" says Jon Dean. \"We all know how painful this is, but he instantly sounds calm and reasoned. But then at least we do see him slapping Nasser, so it's nice to know he's not always in pure control.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 49-0 (Smith 33, Amla 16)</strong> Finn restores a bit of order with a quiet over that costs just a couple. \"A quick question: what is the point of Craig Kieswetter?\" says Ed Wilson. \"This weekend Matt Prior proved yet again that he can play exciting aggressive cricket, so why not let him ply his trade in all forms? Or do we have a reciprocal agreement whereby we must include a lapsed South African in every team fielded\u2026\"</p> <p>Prior has had loads of chances in ODIs and never really done it. That said, I was at Canterbury yesterday and he looked what he is, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/content/current/story/579654.html\">a class act who is getting better and better</a>. He'll get another go at some stage I'm sure, but for now England think that Kieswetter is a developing young talent (his keeping has improved a lot) who has the rare and vital ability to hit sixes. He has hit 27 in 39 ODIs; Prior has hit six in 68. I don't know that it would be fair to drop Kieswetter at this stage.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 54-0 (Smith 35, Amla 19)</strong> If David Lynch made a film about an English cricket fan driven doolally in the summer of 2012 by his twisted dreams*, that dream would involve Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla scoring run after run after run. They milk five more from Bresnan's second over. SILENCIO.<br><em><br>* Mulholland Cover Drive! The Straight Bat Story! Spin Twin Peaks! Lost Highway Outside Leg Stump And Therefore Can't Be Given Out LBW! Honk! Honk? C'mon, honk with me now.</em></p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 59-0 (Smith 38, Amla 21)</strong> Graeme Swann has probably had a few nightmares about Hashim Amla in recent weeks, and now he's on to bowl at him. Amla \u2013 stop me if you think you've read this one before \u2013 gets across outside off stump to work the first ball for a single before Smith sweeps a two and a single. Amla drives the last ball to mid on for a single. At the moment it seems like he could play Swann with an imaginary stick of rhubarb.</p> <p>\"Is 'blootered' a real word,\" says Richard Mansell, \"or one that you have just made up in boredom, hoping to attract emails from pedants like me?\" <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Blooter\">Nothing to do with me</a>.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 65-0 (Smith 38, Amla 27)</strong> Samit Patel replaces Tim Bresnan. South Africa are playing very well now, Amla in particular. When Patel gives him a snifter of width, Amla flays it through extra cover for four with such fast hands. Patel's response is a slightly scary jaffa that drifts onto middle stump and turns a long way past both the outside edge and the off stump. We guessed this pitch would turn but that went a mile \u2013 well, 6.7 degrees to be precise. South Africa have one specialist spinner and about eight part-time spinners in their side. If it keeps turning like that England might think about giving Kevin Pietersen a few oh.</p> <p>\"If I may broaden the scope to written commentary, I currently have Bull's OBO entry of that Ponting wicket pinned up by my desk,\" says Tom Hopkins. \"That may, or may not, make me a Winner.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/dec/02/the-ashes-2010-second-test-first-day\">Here is that memorable piece of Bullwork</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>WICKET! Ponting 0 c Swann b Anderson (Australia 0-2)</strong> Ponting has gone first ball! I don't believe it! An unbelievable start for England! Ponting has gone for a golden duck in his 150th Test and England have gone wild. Stop the clocks! Hold the front pages! Shout it from the rooftops! Australia are in utter disarray! It was a lovely ball from Anderson, full and swinging away. Ponting prodded at it and the ball moved just enough to take the edge and shot straight to second slip where Swann took the catch.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 70-0 (Smith 41, Amla 29)</strong> Five singles from Swann's second over. After a slow start, South Africa have scored 45 from the last eight. \"Not commentary per se but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrCNUrnsu2s&amp;feature=related\">a brilliant clip from David 'Bumble' Lloyd talking about that moment</a>,\" says Nick Barrett. \"Still brings tears to the eyes.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 73-0 (Smith 44, Amla 29)</strong> Graeme Smith launches into an ugly but effective reverse sweep, swiping it just over short fine leg for a couple. The next ball from Patel beats him on the inside but doesn't quite turn enough to hit the off stump.</p> <p>\"I have sent many emails to you over the past 12 months on the subject of Bresnan, and how I believe he has been extremely flattered to play for England as much as he has,\" says Andrew Hurley. \"I feel he is really being exposed now, and can't understand why they played him instead of Woakes, who has enormous potential, and is a genuine all-rounder.\" I'm sure it's not meant that way&#xa0;\u2013 tone can be misread with the written word \u2013&#xa0;but that email almost sounds you're saying 'Told you so!' about something that hasn't happened yet.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 77-0 (Smith 46, Amla 31)</strong> England are waiting to take a wicket before they take their bowling Powerplay. At the moment it looks as if they will be taking the Powerplay sometime in the year 2016. Smith and Amla are in control.</p> <p>\"The greatest commentary of all has to be Bill Lawry's offering as Dean Headley ripped through the Aussie middle order during the 387 hour final session at the MCG in 1998,\" says Ali Walker. \"'<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So_A_vEfI-o#t=43m30s\">SIX FOR ONE FORTY! HICK TAKES THE CATCH; THIS GAME IS ALIVE AND KICKING</a>!'\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 81-0 (Smith 48, Amla 33)</strong> Patel's third over is milked for four. Smith is dominating the scoring but Amla's strike rate is much higher, 94 to Smith's 72.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 86-0 (Smith 50, Amla 36)</strong> England have taken the bowling Powerplay now. They badly need a wicket and inviting attacking strokes might do that. Bresnan returns, as usual during a Powerplay, and his first over back costs five runs. The last of those brings Smith to an important fifty from 70 balls.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 89-0 (Smith 52, Amla 37)</strong> I spent most of that over from Samit Patel trying to calculate approximately how much of my life I have spent OBOing the middle overs of a one-day international. I'll be back with you just as soon as I can see through the tears.</p> <p>\"No emails\u2026 well I only just remembered there was a game on,\" says Damian Sefton. \"Just imagine if we'd cashed these five ODIs in for a test. Sigh.\" Too right. We'd have given South Africa a <em>serious</em> dead rubber kicking in that dead rubber, no question.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 89-1 (Smith c Kieswetter b Bresnan 52)</strong> Tim Bresnan makes an important breakthrough for England. Smith, on the charge, top edged a roundhouse blow miles in the air, and Kieswetter ran back a fair way towards the boundary to take a very well judged catch.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 95-1 (Amla 42, Duminy 1)</strong> Dean Elgar was down to come in at No3 but in fact it's JP Duminy. Amla opens the face to glide Bresnan for four. This bloke secretes class.</p> <p>\"Not intended to be a told you so at all, no interest in that,\" says Andrew Hurley. \"I do have an interest however in getting this vastly overrated player out of the England teams with so much bowling talent around. In 2012, Bresnan's Test average is 46.56, and his ODI economy rate is 5.45 (Finn 4.01, Anderson 4.57). His continued, almost assumed selection, makes little sense and doesn't, unfortunately, reflect particularly well on Flower/Selectors.\" Against that, his ODI average this year is better than Anderson's (he bowls in the batting Powerplay so will inevitably have a higher economy rate) and his overall Test average is better than both Anderson's and Stuart Broad's. This is without mentioning his batting. Look, I can't be bothered having this discussion, in truth. I like him, you don't like him, Andy Flower likes him a lot. That's about it really.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 99-1 (Amla 45, Duminy 2)</strong> Amla is dropped by Kieswetter! It was a sharp chance, as they all are standing up to the stumps, and Kieswetter didn't get down quickly enough. He might have done better as it was only a thin edge. There is another near miss later in the over when a delivery stops on the pitch and is looped just short of point by Amla. Patel has bowled nicely thus far and has figures of 5-0-20-0.</p> <p>\"The most vivid commentary I remember is from long back,\" says Jerry Dawson, \"<em>that</em> over from Holding to Boycott on TMS. I haven't heard it again since, but even at the time it was obvious that it was something a bit special. I'd watched the Test the previous summer at Old Trafford and could imagine that massive silent run-up starting from near the boundary, the ball moving so fast it was invisible to the spectator before suddenly it clapped into keeper Murray's hands. And he'd be stood damn near on the opposite boundary. It was terrifying just to see or hear, I can't imagine what it would be like to face that (without even a helmet!).\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-f5pfBgpNE\">I'm not sure what all the fuss was about</a>.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 101-1 (Amla 46, Duminy 2)</strong> Anderson replaces Bresnan. A back-foot drive from Duminy is saved brilliantly by Morgan at backward point, and there's just a single from the over.</p> <p>\"Classic commentary: '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEy-FX9k3C8\">done him between the legs</a>,'\" says Nagarjun K. \"Benaud on Warne bowling Basit Ali.\" That was such a brilliant dismissal. He did between the legs and between the ears.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 104-1 (Amla 47, Duminy 4)</strong> \"Yes, that is about it 'really', but there is little point in me or anyone else writing in to debate something if that is the riposte...\" says Andrew Hurley. I did think about knocking up a quick 800-word piece on how I learned to stop worrying and love Tim Bresnan, but I'm quite busy with this match. There is a discussion as to what extent Bresnan's cheese sandwich influences opinions of his worth as a cricketer, but it's difficult to do that in the middle of a match. I'm not entirely sure what your point is. You think he's crap, fine. But all you offered was a couple of statistics which were so obviously not representative of the full story that it took about 0.4 seconds to find a pair of statistics with which to respond.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 105-1 (Duminy not out 4)</strong> England have wasted their only review. The ball from Anderson to Duminy that prompted a big LBW appeal clearly pitched outside leg stump, and therefore the fact that Duminy was plumb in front was completely irrelevant. But Anderson and Kieswetter convinced Alastair Cook to go for the review, and now England have no reviews left. There's a moral in that story, kids.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 112-1 (Amla 48, Duminy 8)</strong> Duminy gets his first boundary with a pristine extra cover drive that teases and beats Patel on the cover boundary. \"Is Brian Close the hardest sportsman ever?\" says William Hardy. \"I remember when I was a kid reading a story about him fielding at short leg and someone pulling a ball that ricocheted off his helmetless head and went for 4. Being a mere slip of a lad of 28, he was way before my time, but he appears to have been, for want of a better phrase, 'nails'.\" He would definitely make a Joy of Six: Hard Sportsmen. I reckon if Brian Close and <a href=\"http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/media/images/history/past-players/dave_mackay.jpg\">Dave Mackay</a> had started an arm-wrestle in 1967, it'd still be going on now.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 118-1 (Amla 50, Duminy 12)</strong> Amla reaches a typically soothing half-century from just 54 balls, with five fours.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 121-2 (Duminy run out 14)</strong> Jimmy Anderson had a bad Test series in the field but he's back to his best here. Amla flicked the new bowler Swann into the leg side and set off, thinking it was past Anderson at square leg. It wasn't. Anderson smoothly stopped the ball, got to his feet and threw it to Kieswetter, who broke the stumps with Duminy halfway down the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 121-1 (Amla 51, Elgar 0)</strong> The new boy Dean Elgar is the new batsman. \"Speaking of batsmen with superhuman one-day averages, I give you Michael Bevan who finished his ODI career with an average of 53.58 from 232 matches,\" says SB Tang. \"With four needed to win off the last ball in a one-dayer against the Windies at the SCG in 1996, Bevan drove Roger Harper straight down the ground for four to send a nation into delirium. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO1XL8_ezVM\">Here's Bill Lawry's commentary</a>. That's when the one-day game peaked in Oz. The moment was so iconic that the then ACB (now Cricket Australia) and Channel Nine replayed it endlessly in cricket ads for the better part of the following decade.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 124-2 (Amla 53, Elgar 1)</strong> Ravi Bopara comes into the attack. He has a fine recent record with the ball in ODIs and took four for 47 in the recent Australia series. With Elgar feeling his way into international cricket, Bopara's first over is a quiet one that goes for three singles. </p> <p>\"The finest piece of Benaudian understatement,\" says Matt Biss, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUymv_k65o\">is clearly 18 seconds in to this clip</a>.\" Haha, that is fantastic.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 128-2 (Amla 56, Elgar 2)</strong> Amla premeditates a lap for a couple of Swann. Kieswetter ran to leg, realising what Amla was going to do, but couldn't quite get in position to attempt what would have been an amazing catch. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja4Ej_XfX6o\">A bit like this one</a>.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 134-2 (Amla 57, Elgar 7)</strong> Elgar gets his first boundary in international cricket, dragging a poor delivery from Bopara round the corner for four. \"This Elgar chap,\" says Jason Streets, \"is a bit of an enigma.\" No.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 141-2 (Amla 63, Elgar 8)</strong> Amla slog-sweeps Swann disdainfully for four and then flicks uncomfortably close to Morgan to midwicket. There's a half chance off the last delivery when Amla takes an iffy single to Anderson round the corner. He would have been out with a direct hit at the bowler's end but the ball whistled past the stumps. South Africa are in a fine position now \u2013 even just a run a ball takes them to a competitive 261.</p> <p>\"Right, can I just double check that moral from England's failed review?\" says Matt Dony. \"Is it to 'Always make the right decisions'? If so, yes, you're right. I'm glad someone finally had the courage to say it.\" What can I say? Where angels fear to assert the bleedin' obvious, I rush in.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 144-2 (Amla 66, Elgar 8)</strong> Elgar is going a little slowly, with eight from 18 balls. It's always difficult when you're playing your first innings in international cricket to balance the needs of himself and the team. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BGqqzBi9JA\\\">Unless you're Shahid Afridi</a>.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 153-2 (Amla 71, Elgar 12)</strong> Elgar drives Swann high in the air, with the ball landing safely on the leg side. That might be a mixed blessing for South Africa. At the other end Amla is scoring almost at will \u2013 just two dot balls in the last seven overs \u2013 and ends the over by driving Swann beautifully through extra cover for three.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 164-2 (Amla 79, Elgar 15)</strong> England miss another run-out chance, this time to get rid of Elgar, who would have been out had Cook hit the stumps from mid off. When Bresnan overpitches later in the over, Amla hammers a gorgeous extra cover drive for four. A cut for three more takes him to 79 from 74 balls. It's been a masterful performance from the best one-day batsman in the world. Not just the attacking strokes, either: only 25 of those 74 have been dot balls.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 165-3 (Elgar b Swann 15)</strong> Swann puts Elgar out of his burgeoning misery with a beautiful delivery that drifts onto middle stump and turns a long way past the edge to hit the stumps. File that under scoreboard pressure \u2013 and also smart bowling from Swann, who gave it a lot more air so that it would turn precisely 6.5 degrees past the edge. Elgar made 15 from 28 balls in fairly difficult circumstances. He probably wasn't helped by the fact the bloke at the other end is batting like a man who invented batting.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 166-3 (Amla 80, de Villiers 1)</strong> The new man is the captain AB de Villiers, so now England are bowling to arguably the best <em>two</em> one-day batsmen in the world. <a href=\"http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/ranking/odi/batting/\">Virat Kohli's fans might legitimately argue otherwise</a>.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>35rd over: South Africa 167-3 (Amla 80, de Villiers 2)</strong> De Villiers tries to run Bresnan to third man but gets it too fine and is dropped by Kieswetter, who was diving so far to his right that he could only punch it for a single. That run takes de Villiers to 5000 in this form of the game.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 178-3 (Amla 81, de Villiers 12)</strong> With 35 overs gone South Africa must take their batting Powerplay. De Villiers, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44936.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting;view=reverse_cumulative\">who averages a ridiculous 408 in his last eight ODIs and 71 in his last 50</a>, times Finn through midwicket for three. Amla is then beaten by a splendid outswinger as he tries to flick to leg, and an eventful over continues with a stunning straight-driven four from de Villiers. He has raced to 12 from six balls.</p> <p>In an unrelated development, here's a question: <a href=\"http://www.adidas.co.uk/Pin-stripes-Airliner-72-Bag/X52221_500%2cen_GB%2cpd.html?cm_mmc=AdieEmail_MKTG-_-Newsletter-_-20120828_Newsletter_201235-_-B-3&amp;cm_mmca1=UK\">at what age is this bag a no-go</a>?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 185-3 (Amla 86, de Villiers 14)</strong> Samit Patel comes back on. It takes a fair bit of courage for a spinner \u2013 a part-time spinner, too, and not a regular in the team \u2013 to bowl during a Powerplay. Amla gives him the charge to wave a delivery high over midwicket for four, the only boundary from an over that costs seven.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542540.html\">KP struggling at Taunton</a>,\" writes Jason Streets.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 191-3 (Amla 87, de Villiers 18)</strong> Six from Finn's over.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 196-3 (Amla 92, de Villiers 18)</strong> Amla launches a slower ball from Bresnan high over mid off for four to move into the nerveless nineties. England thought they had him strangled down the leg side next ball, but the umpire Rob Bailey disagreed and so did Hotspot. Bopara makes a fine stop at short midwicket later in the over when de Villiers gets medieval on a short ball from Bresnan.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 205-3 (Amla 99, de Villiers 20)</strong> This time Amla really could have been taken down the leg side. He walked across to Finn and flicked the ball very fine, but Kieswetter couldn't hold a low chance to his left. That's his third drop of the day and probably the least difficult. An ingenious uppercut from Amla beats Bresnan on the third man boundary and takes him to 98, and a single to mid on takes him to within one of yet another century. Much more of this and 2012 will be remembered as the English summer of Amla (and wet shoes). South Africa will be very pleased with that batting Powerplay, with brought 48 from five overs.</p> <p>In ostracised genius news, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542540.html\">Kevin Pietersen has made a century for Surrey at Taunton</a>.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 212-3 (Amla 105, de Villiers 21)</strong> Amla drives Patel down the ground to reach a simply marvellous century from only 96 balls, his 10th in only 59 ODIs. There's an increasing sense that we might be watching one of the all-time greats here, a contender to bat alongside Kallis and Pollock in the middle order of an all-time South African XI. Amla is still only 29 and is going to score an indecent amount of runs in the next seven or eight years. He's a batsman whose serene certainty crushes a bowler's soul by the time he's reached 20 or 30. A decent knock in his next Test innings will make him, for a time at least, the only man in history to average over 50 in Test cricket, ODIs and first-class cricket. He can do brutality, too, and when Patel drops far too short he is slaughtered over midwicket for four.</p> <p>\"The fact that you had to ask inherently means that bag is already a no-go,\" says Sam Hedges. \"About 22 I reckon FWIW.\" I was going to say 35 but it's the same difference. I'll stick to Millets.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 218-3 (Amla 108, de Villiers 24)</strong> A rare mistake from Simon Taufel. de Villiers top edges a reverse sweep at Swann onto his shoulder, from where it loops gently into the hands of Kieswetter. Simon Taufel says not out, however, and because England tried that optimistic review against Duminy earlier on they have no reviews left. England have the face on, Swann in particular, but it's their own fault.</p> <p>\"That's a great bag,\" says Martin Sinclair. \"I'm turning 40 this Saturday (aaiieeee!!!), so the 72 on the front could represent the year of my birth, so I reckon I could get away with it \u2013 not as a fashion item but as a memory aid. Therefore, 40 is the age limit for that bag.\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 226-3 (Amla 114, de Villiers 25)</strong> Here comes Jimmy Anderson. Anything above 280 will be a really stiff target. South Africa might even get 300 here, if de Villiers goes mad. Amla doesn't need to go mad; he quietly destroys attacks, and has just shown remarkable wristwork to flick Anderson behind square for four. There was a vacancy for international cricket's resident rubber-wristed genius when Murali retired. It's fair to say that vacancy has now been filled. Amla has 114 from 104 balls.</p> <p>\"My 15 year old daughter would love that bag,\" says Howard Fairbrass. \"When worn by anyone older than say 28 proceed with caution. Unless you work or live in Shoreditch, sport an ironic beard and ride a fake fixed bike badly in which case the age limit would appear to be about 40.\"</p> <p>Pinstripes do look great \u2013 <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HnlNuRZUOpI/SR8gnxIE6QI/AAAAAAAAAE4/fjTs1ce5_N8/s320/5e75_1.JPG\">see Richie Tenenbaum</a> \u2013 but once you get to a certain age you have to accept it's over and that, with the possible exception of work shirts, you've sported your last pinstripe. No more pinstripes for you.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 230-4 (de Villiers b Swann 28)</strong> Swann gets his man this time. De Villiers was beaten by a change of pace and almost yorked himself as he charged down the track. That's a lovely piece of bowling. Swann's Test form isn't great but he continues to do extremely well for England in both limited-overs forms.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 232-4 (Amla 116, du Plessis 1)</strong> \"Not a good time for Kieswetter to be dropping catches is it \u2013 what with Prior battering the door down?\" says Rory Taylor. No it's not. He's actually kept pretty well for England this summer but has had a poor day today. I feel a bit sorry for Kieswetter, who has played almost every match for England with his place under scrutiny in the media. In that regard he's almost a spiritual successor to Paul Collingwood. I suppose they're a bit like John Cusack when he goes out with Charlie Nicholson in High Fidelity. The men who never got comfortable.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 243-4 (Amla 123, du Plessis 6)</strong> Amla helps a piece of rubbish from Anderson to fine leg for four, which takes him to 3000 runs in one-day internationals \u2013 and he has reached that milestone in 57 innings, 12 faster than the previous record holder, Sir Viv Richards. That, and his career average of 58.88, are staggering statistics. Anderson's eighth over disappears for 12, with Faf du Plessis hustling a cracking pull stroke to the midwicket boundary.</p> <p>\"Isn't that the sort of bag that Nathan Barley would carry?\" says Toby Blake. \"Maybe it's just because I'm an old geezer, but I find there's something truly dispiriting about retro fashion. Or any fashion, for that matter, but retro is the worst of all. Bowler hats though, I wish they'd come back.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 248-4 (Amla 125, du Plessis 8)</strong> A very good final over from Samit Patel goes for five, so he ends with figures of 10-0-47-0. \"The Beard Liberation Front has said that Hashim Amla's century in the one day international at Southampton today following his triple century in the Oval Test has led to him being awarded the accolade of Cricketing Beard of Summer 2012,\" says Keith Flett. \" BLF Organiser Keith Flett said there has been nothing to match Amla's beard on the cricket field this summer. By contrast follicly challenged England have struggled.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 261-4 (Amla 138, du Plessis 9)</strong> The preantepenultimate over of the innings costs 14. A low full toss from Bresnan is slugged over midwicket for four by the magnificent Amla. The next ball brings a beautiful piece of cricket. Amla walks across his stumps, looking to whip to leg; Bresnan sees him coming and throws it wide of off stump; so Amla changes his stroke at the last minute to steer it past Kieswetter for four. \"Oh brilliant!\" exclaims Mike Atherton on Sky. What an innings this has been.</p> <p>\"What do people make of Strauss' decision to play only one county match before departing for India?\" says Oliver Smiddy. \"Surely playing this week for Middlesex would have been more beneficial, given his abject recent form, than a few extra days' gardening/reading James Anderson's autobiography, \"Jimmy: My Story\". According to the man himself, the cover (the author brooding at the camera) 'looks great'.\" I thought it was the right decision. He looked shattered mentally by the time he padded up to Philander, and the need for a break surely outweighed the need for any time in the middle. Not least because a failure would have brought more media scrutiny, and a century would have been belittled because it wasn't in a Test match.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>As the budding Poirots and Poirettes among you may have suspected, we've had major technical problems for the last couple of hours</strong>. Something about an 'invalid bean definition'. No, seriously. We're very sorry about the lack of updates, and if you contact our commercial department they will refund the 120 minutes you have just spent pressing F5 and cursing Rob Smyth's indolence.</p> <p>To the match. England are currently 73 for two from 15 overs, chasing a stiff target of 288. Alastair Cook had technical problems too: he fell over a very full-length delivery from Essex's finest, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, and was bowled second ball for nought. Jonathan Trott made 23 before falling to an outrageous catch at long leg from Dean Elgar. Ian Bell was dropped early on, a difficult leaping chance to the keeper AB de Villiers, but has since played some fine strokes.</p> <p>South Africa's total of 287 for five was largely down to Hashim Amla's stunning 150 from 124 balls. Who says you need to hit sixes in one-day cricket? Amla didn't. There were 16 fours, three threes, twelve twos, 53 singles and only 41 dot balls. The thing is: you <em>do</em> need to hit sixes in one-day cricket, unless you have wrists to die for. This was a very very special innings.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 77-3 (Bell b Peterson 45)</strong> I told you Bell was playing well. He has gone to a good delivery from the left-arm spinner Robin Peterson that turned past the edge to hit the stumps as Bell pushed defensively down the wrong line. Bell made a good 45 from 41 balls, but England are in trouble now.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 77-3 (target 288; Bopara 6, Morgan 0)</strong> Stop me if you think you've read this one before: it's probably Morgan or bust for England. \"Been stinking busy at work so have't had a chance to check the OBO all day and get home to find find it's frozen,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Having fun? Techie types frantically unplugging and plugging wires? Smoke billowing from the keyboard? You locked yourself in the toilets and threatening to go postal if it isn't fixed soon?\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 90-4 (Bopara c du Plessis b Peterson 16)</strong> Oh Ravi. Naughty Ravi. <em>Silly</em> Ravi. Bopara has just thrashed a long hop from Peterson straight to short extra cover, and England are in all sorts of trouble now. In fact they're in almost as much trouble as our publishing system, which is down again. Sorry.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Right, this appears to be working again</strong>. I <em>know</em>. England are now 117 for four from 23 overs, needing 171 from 27 overs.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 118-5 (Kieswetter c Smith b Elgar 20)</strong> Every time our publishing system returns to life, England lose a wicket. Craig Kieswetter has fallen to a fine delivery from the left-arm spinner Dean Elgar, which turned sharply to take a thin edge as Kieswetter attempted to turn to leg. AB de Villiers couldn't react sharply enough to take the catch but managed to basically punch the ball in the air and that allowed Graeme Smith at slip to catch the loose ball. Kieswetter made a decent run-a-ball 20, including the only six of the match off JP Duminy.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 118-5 (Morgan 9, Patel 0)</strong> The ball is turning a fair way for South Africa's army of spinners, and I'm not sure even Eoin Morgan can get England out of this.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 121-5 (Morgan 11, Patel 1)</strong> Our publishing system is going up and down faster than Basil Fawlty's moose. Sorry. England need 167 from 150 balls, aka a minor miracle.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 127-5 (Morgan 12, Patel 6)</strong> Patel works Elgar classily against the spin for four. In other news, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk9YFZ-8xc&amp;feature=plcp\">look at this beast of a delivery from Sylvester Clarke</a>.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 127-5 (target: 288; Morgan 12, Patel 6)</strong> A maiden from Ryan McLaren to Samit Patel. We're still having a few problems I'm afraid. As are England, who require 161 from 138 balls. \"I saw The Poirettes in Dalston last night,\" says Eamonn Maloney. \"They were shit.\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 135-5 (target: 288; Morgan 16, Patel 7)</strong> An unplayable delivery from Elgar turns, grubs, misses Patel's off stump by a whisker and goes between de Villiers's legs for three byes. Elgar has turned it more than anyone else in this match.</p> <p>\"I know it's not cricket but any OBO that asks for favourite commentaries has to mention the late, great Sid Waddell,\" says Simon McMahon. \"His line comparing Eric Bristow to Alexander the Great is worthy of Shakespeare - 'When Alexander of Macedonia was 33 he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds to conquer ... Bristow's only 27!'\" Oh aye. Sid Waddell is the only sports commentator who has made the word 'genius' seem inadequate.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 143-5 (target: 288; Morgan 17, Patel 14)</strong> Patel clouts a slower ball from McLaren through extra cover for four. Eight from the over. At the other end Morgan has played pretty carefully, making his 17 not out from 31 balls. I suppose he knows if that he goes England cannot win the match, so he is taking as long as possible to get used to this tricky pitch.</p> <p>\"One of the best bits of commentary I ever heard was by Ian Smith, a great commentator sadly underused, at the Oval in 2003,\" says Eddie Leman. \"After Martin Bicknell bowled a few balls across the left-handed Jacques Rudolph, Smithy started getting excited, exclaiming that it was all part of a plan, and that Bicknell was about to bring an inswinger to the party, that Rudolph would attempt to leave it, and that he'd be bowled or leg before. Seconds later, Bicknell did precisely that and bowled him. Mark Nicholas immediately went into an exuberant eulogy of how it was \"one of the finest pieces of commentary you are ever likely to hear\". Unfortunately I can't find a clip. Instead, how about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcI9s_wHdds\">this one of Mark finding a very poor gag</a> from KP extravagantly funny.\"</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 146-5 (target: 288; Morgan 20, Patel 14)</strong> The new bowler Tsotsobe draws a leading edge from Morgan that somehow has enough power to drop safely over mid off, and then Patel chips one a fraction short of midwicket. One more wicket now would surely finish the game because England only really have Bresnan and Swann to come.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 147-5 (target: 288; Morgan 21, Patel 14)</strong> Morgan digs out a fine yorker from the new bowler Parnell, who then forces Patel to duck under a sharp bouncer. Just one from a good over, and that leaves England needing 141 from 114 balls.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>Hello. Me again</strong>. Remember me? The cricket bloke. You missed four wickets during our latest interruption: Eoin Morgan holed out off JP Duminy, Tim Bresnan and Graeme Swann made ducks, and Jimmy Anderson \u2013 who, in an endearing homage to the darker days of 2009, was at the crease when England took their batting Powerplay \u2013 has just been run out.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>England's last pair are at least going down swinging</strong>. Steven Finn blootered Morne Morkel for three consecutive fours in the previous over, and now Samit Patel has launched Robin Peterson for 16 from three balls. Good lad. The crowd are roaring like it's Headingley '81. Well, Lord's 2012 anyway. Who says losing has to be depressin'?!</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY 80 RUNS. England 207 all out (Patel c de Villiers b Morkel 45)</strong> Samit Patel is caught behind off Morne Morkel to complete a crushing win for South Africa. They have battered England, and in doing so become the first side to top the ICC Team Rankings in all three forms of the game. Who's choking now? South Africa are looking down on the rest of world cricket. This match was decided by a lordly innings from Hashim Amla, whose 150 was almost three times the next highest score on either side, Graeme Smith's 52. Thanks for your emails; sorry for the farce; see you on Friday for the third ODI. I'll leave you with this email from professional hooter Simon McMahon.</p> <p>\"I know you're not one to blow your own trumpet, Rob, but your commentary between the 47th over of the SA innings and the 16th over of England's reply must rank alongside anything you've ever done.

  "<p>There has been much talk of the Olympic legacy, which may stretch to include a health dividend, the regeneration of east London, an ongoing financial commitment to sporting excellence and a brief summer spike in otherwise miserable growth figures. But what of the unintended consequences of staging the Games in London?

Apparently Brand and Halliwell met during the closing-ceremony rehearsals and just clicked, like two ends of a seatbelt. Their relationship, whether sanctioned by the IOC or not, creates one of those two-headed celebrity monsters that boasts its own name, Brandiwell. There was nothing about this in the original bid.</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson has become an international figure.</strong> If you had read that two months ago, you would probably have said: \"Hey!

And not in spite of the fact that he spent 30 minutes dangling from a stalled zip wire, but in part because of it.</p> <p><strong>We have developed a strange and enduring ease with the idea of soldiers in the streets.</strong> The polite, helpful, smiling army people who stepped in to rescue Olympic security made the possibility of martial law seem almost inviting. At the very least it seems preferable to being ordered about by poorly trained people in tabards.</p> <p><strong>Danny Boyle is now the unofficial arbiter of national identity. </strong>Britain was formerly a place that delighted \u2013 or at least wallowed \u2013 in having no cohesive identity.

  "<p>Over the last few years, at the kinds of conferences where the world's technological elite gathers to mainline caffeine and determine the course of history, Google has entertained the crowds with a contraption it calls <a href=\"http://www.google.com/earth/explore/showcase/liquidgalaxy.html\" title=\"Liquid Galaxy\">Liquid Galaxy</a>. It consists of eight large LCD screens, turned on their ends and arranged in a circle, with a joystick at the centre. The screens display vivid satellite imagery from Google Earth, and the joystick permits three-dimensional \"flight\", so that stepping inside Liquid Galaxy feels like boarding your own personal UFO, in which you can zoom from the darkness of space down to the ocean's surface, cruising low over deserts, or inspecting the tops of skyscrapers. (The illusion of real movement is powerful; your legs may tremble.) You can swoop down to street-level in Cape Town, spot ships in the Mekong river, or lose yourself in the whiteness of Antarctica.</p> <p>But you don't, of course. What you do \u2013 or what I did, anyway, but watch anyone using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/earth/index.html\" title=\"Google Earth\">Google Earth</a> for the first time, and you'll see they do the equivalent \u2013 is to hurtle across continents to the semi-detached house on the outskirts of York where you grew up, to peer down at a street you know well. In an era of previously unimagined opportunities for exploring the far-off and strange, we want mainly to stare at ourselves.</p> <p>It is a testament to the rate of change in the world of mapping, though, that Liquid Galaxy is now essentially old hat. Google has much, much bigger plans. In June it revealed that it had already started using planes \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/apple-google-using-military-grade-spy-planes-to-make-new-maps-says-senator/\" title=\"military-grade spy planes\">military-grade spy planes</a>\", the New York senator Charles Schumer claimed \u2013 to provide more detailed 3D imagery of the world's big cities. It also unveiled the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ae5MzPKAQ4\" title=\"Street View Trekker\">Street View Trekker</a>, a bulky backpack with several 15-megapixel cameras protruding on a stalk, so that operatives can capture \"offroad\" imagery from hiking trails, narrow alleyways or the forest floor. Almost every month, new kinds of data are incorporated into Google Maps: in June, it was 2,000 miles of British canal towpaths, complete with bridges and locks; it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/jul/12/google-maps-uk-cycle-routes\" title=\"bike lanes\">bike lanes</a>. And for the first time, Google's dominance of digital mapping faces a credible threat: Apple has announced that it will no longer include Google Maps on iPhones or iPads, replacing it with an alternative that, an Apple source told the tech blog All Things D, \"will blow your head off\".</p> <p>\"I honestly think we're seeing a more profound change, for mapmaking, than the switch from manuscript to print in the Renaissance,\" says the University of London cartographic historian Jerry Brotton. \"That was huge. But this is bigger.\" The transition to print gave far more people access to maps. The transition to ubiquitous digital mapping accelerates and extends that development \u2013 but it is also transforming the roles that maps play in our lives.</p> <p>The idea of a one-to-one scale map of the world, portraying everything in it, is a venerable device in literature, surfacing most famously in the work of Lewis Carroll and Jorge Luis Borges; in Harry Potter, there's a map that shows what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVBha-QUUCE\" title=\"everyone in Hogwarts is doing at every moment\">everyone in Hogwarts is doing at every moment</a>. But in the era of Street View Trekker and Liquid Galaxy, these fictional maps seem somewhat less absurd \u2013 and the level of detail is only one way in which maps are changing. Increasingly, the boundary between consulting a map and interacting with the world outside it is blurring: when Google glasses, currently in prototype, can project directions, or reviews of the restaurant you're looking at, directly into your visual field, what does the word \"map\" mean anymore? While researching his forthcoming book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/history-world-twelve-maps-review\" title=\"A History of the World in Twelve Maps\">A History of the World in Twelve Maps</a>, Brotton sometimes brought up the \"one-to-one map\" idea, from Borges and Carroll, with people at Google, but they didn't find it particularly witty or intriguing.</p> <p>\"Oh, yeah,\" they would reply, matter-of-factly. \"We can make that map.\"</p> <p>For many of us, pulling out a smartphone to find the quickest route to a meeting, or to the pub, is so ubiquitous a daily habit that it's hard to remember how absurdly recently it became possible. Google Maps was launched in 2005 \u2013 \"and that was the watershed,\" says David Heyman, a founder of the cartography company Axis Maps. \"Before that, we were on that old Mapquest thing \u2013 that was just an interface for loading a static map, really. But then Google Maps comes along, and suddenly you feel like you're in this seamless interactive environment.\" It became possible for users to create \"mashups\", building sites in which Google's basic maps were overlaid with other data: information about flats for rent, or the course of international warfare throughout history, or the best Indian restaurants in Glasgow.</p> <p>A couple of years beforehand, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had been fascinated by the zooming satellite imagery used by US news networks to report on bombing raids in Iraq. Those terrain graphics were provided by Keyhole, Inc, a software company that the CIA had helped to fund. Unlike the rest of us, Page and Brin had the wherewithal to act upon their fascination: they bought Keyhole, repackaging and releasing the firm's software as Google Earth in 2005. \"They say they bought it because it looked cool,\" says Brotton. \"But my view is that they absolutely knew what they were buying. They marketed it in this touchy-feely way, as an environmental thing, and they called it 'Earth' \u2013 'Google World' would have sounded imperialist. But they knew that what they were getting with Keyhole would be integral to the search business.\"</p> <p>There is a sense, in fact, in which mapping is the essence of what Google does. The company likes to talk about services such as Maps and Earth as if they were providing them for fun \u2013 a neat, free extra as a reward for using their primary offering, the search box. But a search engine, in some sense, is an attempt to map the world of information \u2013 and when you can combine that conceptual world with the geographical one, the commercial opportunities suddenly explode. Search results for restaurants or doctors or taxi firms mean far more, and present far juicier opportunities for advertisers, when they are geographically relevant. And then there's the most important point \u2013 the really exciting or troubling one, depending on your perspective. In a world of GPS-enabled smartphones, you're not just consulting Google or Apple data stores when you consult a map: you're adding to them.</p> <p>Exactly what information the companies collect, and what they do with it, remains much debated. But it's easy to grasp the basic commercial calculation. The more exactly your phone knows where you are, the more accurately you can be served with advertisements based on the places you'll be passing. (Ads on Google are already geo-targeted.) There's no technical reason why, perhaps in return for a cheaper phone bill, you mightn't consent to be shown not the quickest route between two points, but the quickest route that passes at least one Starbucks. If you're looking at the world through Google glasses, who determines which aspects of \"augmented reality\" data you see \u2013 and did they pay for the privilege? Combining GPS with the new Indoor Positioning System, which uses cellular and other phone data to track phones much more precisely, shops could easily track customers' movements among the aisles, adjusting displays on a&#xa0;day-by-day basis for maximum revenue.</p> <p>\"The map is mapping us,\" says Martin Dodge, a senior lecturer in human geography at Manchester University. \"I'm not paranoid, but I&#xa0;am quite suspicious and cynical about products that appear to be innocent and neutral, but that are actually vacuuming up all kinds of behavioural and attitudinal data.\"</p> <p>This is why, to techno-zealots and sceptics alike, the media panic over maps and privacy seems rather misplaced. \"Barbecuing or sunbathing in your backyard shouldn't be a public event,\" New York's senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"People should be free of the worry of some hi-tech peeping tom technology violating one's privacy when in your own home.\" German law allows individuals to request the blurring of their homes on Street View. (<a href=\"http://buzzmachine.com/2010/11/02/germany-what-have-you-done/\" title=\"You have digitally desecrated your cities,\">\"You have digitally desecrated your cities,\"</a> the new-media commentator Jeff Jarvis responded in fury.) Certainly, this debate matters. But it's hard to interpret the occasional aerial snapshot of your garden as a big issue when the phone in your pocket is assembling a real-time picture of your movements, preferences and behaviour.</p> <p>Google and Apple insist, plausibly enough, that they're not interested in anyone's individual data: the commercial value lies in the patterns they can detect in the aggregate. But you'd be forgiven for not being entirely reassured. In any case, the concern that someone else might discover certain things about you isn't necessarily the most disorienting implication of the new generation of maps. More dizzying is the thought that \u2013 as maps based on mined data come to shape our sense of space, to navigate our journeys, and to narrow our online searches \u2013 Google's and Apple's maps might not just observe our lives, but in some sense come to play a role in&#xa0;directing their course.</p> <p>\"There's kind of a fine line that you run,\" said Ed Parsons, Google's chief geospatial technologist, in a session at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, \"between this being really useful, and it being creepy.\"</p> <p>For some, the ubiquity of maps \u2013 the way they are seeping into every corner of our \"real\", concrete world \u2013 triggers more nebulous, philosophical worries. With maps always in our pockets, or literally in front of our eyes, might we lose the ability to wander, and to get lost? If we're constantly glancing at our phones, or being bombarded by extra layers of data about where we're going, won't we become disconnected from the world around us? Is there something beneficial in having to stop to ask directions \u2013 an experience that will probably all but vanish, for most of us, in the next few years?</p> <p>Cartographers don't seem to see things this way. \"I actually think it's easier to get lost these days,\" says Heyman. \"Now, when I get to a new city, I can walk off wherever I like, without caring, because I know I'll be able to get back, consequence-free.\" And the idea that we're losing touch with reality doesn't hold water, argues Brotton. \"It's actually much more interesting than that.\" The really important question is: who controls the specific filters on which we're increasingly coming to rely? \"Google and Apple are saying that they want control over people's real and imagined space.\"</p> <p>Which brings us to the core of the matter. It can be easy to assume that maps are objective: that the world is out there, and that a good map is one that represents it accurately. But that's not true. Any square mile of the planet can be described in an infinite number of ways: in terms of its natural features, its weather, its socio-economic profile, or what you can buy in the shops there. Traditionally, the interests reflected in maps have been those of states and their armies, because they were the ones who did the mapmaking, and the primary use of many such maps was military. (If you had the better maps, you stood a good chance of winning the battle. <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Ordnance+Survey+logo&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=btI8UKDEMam80QXS7YAg&amp;ved=0CFUQsAQ&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=913\" title=\"The Ordnance Surveys logo\">The Ordnance Survey's logo</a> still includes a visual reference to the 18th-century War Department.) Now, the power is shifting. \"Every map,\" the cartography curator Lucy Fellowes once said, \"is someone's way of getting you to look at the world his or her way.\" What happens when we come to see the world, to a significant extent, through the eyes of a handful of big companies based in California? You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist, or an anti-corporate crusader, to wonder about the subtle ways in which their values and interests might come to shape our lives.</p> <p>The question cartographers are always being asked at cocktail parties, says Heyman, is whether there's really any mapmaking still left to do: we've mapped the whole planet already, haven't we? The question could hardly be more misconceived. We are just beginning to grasp what it means to live in a world in which maps are everywhere \u2013 and in which, by using maps, we are mapped ourselves.</p>",

Many savers who bought the shares thought they were risk-free deposits from high street banks.</p> <p>A new law due to be passed on Friday should settle their part of the bill for a banking crisis whose origins lie in the residential housing bubble that burst four years ago.</p> <p>The new law should also set up a state \"bad bank\" to absorb toxic real estate \u2013 largely worthless building land and unsold new properties \u2013 that forced the nationalisation of several banks.</p> <p>Attempts to stave off a full bailout took a blow on Tuesday when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed \u20ac5bn from a central government rescue fund.</p> <p>Catalonia is one of half a dozen regional governments shut out of markets and needing government help to roll over debt and fund budget deficits. Regions have a combined debt of \u20ac145bn, with \u20ac36bn needing refinancing this year.</p> <p>A report by the Fedea thinktank predicts Catalonia \u2013 which accounts for one fifth of the economy \u2013 will miss the 1.5% deficit target set this year, with an expected 2.5% deficit making it the second worst performing region.</p> <p>Rajoy's conservative central government may eventually take direct control of the region's finances.</p> <p>Regional prime minister Artur Mas, of the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, has threatened a snap election if that happens. His spokesman, Francesc Homs, rejected any \"political terms\" for borrowing the money.</p> <p>But as Spain pinned its hopes for avoiding a full bailout on future bond-buying by the European Central Bank, not all news was bad. On Tuesday it managed to borrow \u20ac3.6bn for three and six months at much lower rates than in recent auctions.</p> <p>Exports continue to grow, while unit labour costs fell 2% \u2013 signs that a gradual internal devaluation may be happening.</p> <p>Spain, meanwhile, has enjoyed a summer tourist boom, which generated 9% more income this July than a year earlier.</p>",
  "<p>The accomplice and former wife of a Belgian paedophile and murderer has been allowed to go free after serving half her sentence for involvement in child abductions, rapes and murders that plunged the national judicial system into crisis.</p> <p>Michelle Martin, the former wife of Marc Dutroux, who received a 30-year sentence for aiding and abetting his kidnapping and molestation of six girls aged eight to 19 in the 1990s, was granted parole at the fourth attempt after serving 16 years in jail.</p> <p>Four of the girls were murdered. Martin became the target of particular national anger because she allowed two of the girls to starve to death in her care while Dutroux was temporarily in prison.</p> <p>The ruling on Tuesday by Belgium's highest court followed three previous failed attempts to win parole.</p> <p>A court in the southern town of Mons ruled last month that she could go free on condition that she went into an Ardennes convent for 10 years. Relatives of Dutroux's victims were outraged and mounted appeals that were overruled on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Clarisse convent in Malonne in the hill country 50 miles south of Brussels delivered an anguished statement describing the difficulties experienced in deciding whether to offer a haven.</p> <p>\"We were shocked by the terrible suffering of the victims and their families, who have gone through hell,\" said the convent's Mother Superior. \"Martin is a human being capable, like all of us, of the worst and the best.\"</p> <p>The successful parole hearings have reopened the wounds in Belgium inflicted by the Dutroux atrocities and the litany of judicial blundering, negligence and alleged connivance and corruption that the case exposed.</p> <p>The victims' families argue that Martin has never shown real remorse for the crimes, which entailed kidnapping children, keeping them imprisoned in specially built cellars in Dutroux's properties, serial torture, sexual abuse and killing.</p> <p>Jean-Denis Lejeune, the father of one of the murdered girls, told Le Soir newspaper on Tuesday that he was going to write to Martin at the convent.</p> <p>\"She has said she wants to make amends. I would like her to tell the truth about the circumstances surrounding the death of my daughter and that she stop telling lies.\"</p> <p>Judges at the Court of Cassation ruled that there had been nothing improper in the Mons court decision to grant Martin parole and dismissed the objections.</p> <p>Georges-Henri Beauthier, a lawyer for two of the victims' families, said: \"The law needs to be changed. The law needs to be reviewed in favour of respecting and listening to the victims.\"</p> <p>Given the strength of feeling generated by the case, Martin will need to be afforded special police protection.

  "<p>More pornography is produced in the Greater Los Angeles area than any other part of the English-speaking world. So when a US-based porn performer recently tested positive for syphilis, the news prompted a self-imposed 10-day moratorium on porn production. Oh, the irony of it. The person held responsible for this outbreak is <a href=\"http://www.xbiz.com/articles/80453/Mr.+marcus\" title=\"\">Mr Marcus</a>, a well-known porn performer and producer who, in a 2007 XBIZ article, was described as \"an outspoken proponent of performers' rights\" following his failed attempt to get porn performers to organise as a group with collective interests.</p> <p>After a number of actors tested HIV-positive in the summer of 2004, Mr Marcus felt that the porn industry had a \"moral obligation\" to safeguard the health of its performers, so he convened a meeting. Not surprisingly, nothing changed. It was business as usual, with another actor testing positive in 2010, and then another in 2011. It would seem that Mr Marcus has changed his tune a bit since 2004 because, according to a recent story in XBIZ, he <a href=\"http://www.xbiz.com/news/153050\" title=\"\">altered his test results</a> so that he could continue to work.</p> <p>As usual, the Free Speech Coalition (FSC), the porn industry's lobbying group, has been working overtime to lend a positive spin to what is simply another example of an industry that shows nothing but contempt for the health and safety of its employees. Diane Duke, the executive director of the FSC, told MSNBC: <a href=\"http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48750873/ns/today-relationships/t/porn-film-production-hold-after-los-angeles-syphilis-cases/#.UDaDgqAhXFw\" title=\"\">\"Clearly our industry's priority is the health and wellbeing of our performers.\"</a> This is the same Diane Duke who has fought tooth and nail against a Los Angeles city council ordinance that would require the use of condoms to protect performers from sexually transmitted diseases.</p> <p>For those unfamiliar with mainstream internet porn, let me explain that we are not talking about films depicting people making love. Today's most popular porn websites have acts that include gagging with a penis; pounding anal sex; spitting into the mouth of a woman; ATM (ass-to-mouth) transitions, in which the penis goes from the anus to the mouth without washing; ejaculation onto the body and sometimes into the eye; and bukkake (wherein any number of men ejaculate on to a woman's body, or into a cup which she then drinks). In writing my book Pornland, I watched hundreds of scenes from the most popular porn movies, and I regularly saw a mixture of saliva, semen, faeces and vomit on the set. Can you name one other multibillion-dollar-a-year industry that is this dangerous, has so little governmental regulation and interfaces with banks, credit card companies, venture capitalists, software developers, hotels and media corporations?</p> <p>The now closed <a href=\"http://www.nationalledger.com/lifestyle-home-family/adult-industry-medical-health--120137.shtml#.UDzoAb_MGIY\" title=\"\">Adult Industry Medical Health Care Association</a>, which was the Los Angeles-based voluntary organisation in charge of testing performers, had a list on its website of possible injuries and diseases to which porn performers were prone. These included HIV; rectal and throat gonorrhea; tearing of the throat, vagina and anus; and chlamydia of the eye. Not your everyday workplace ailments \u2013 unless, of course, you are a prostituted woman.</p> <p>Sounding like a character out of Orwell's 1984, Duke argued that the condom ordinance spearheaded by the Los Angeles-based Aids Action Committee was not about \"performer health and safety\", but rather about the <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/01/la-approves-condom-rule.html\" title=\"\">\"government regulating what happens between consenting adults\"</a>. Such a statement renders invisible the reality of the lives of porn performers who, like most workers under capitalism, are not equal participants in the employer-employee contract. Porn performers who don't own companies, like the rest of us, do not get to dictate the conditions of their work. Instead, they're at the mercy of the employer, whose role is to maximise profits, no matter what the cost to the workers.</p> <p>The porn industry projects an image of itself as one run by a bunch of cool and hip renegade artists who are at the cutting edge of protecting our freedoms. In reality, they abhor any government regulations that cut into profit. And there is no doubt whatsoever that requiring performers to use condoms will have a major economic impact on the porn industry. Porn consumers do not want condoms. As the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/06/condom-initiative-by-anti-aids-group-threatens-porn-industry.html\" title=\"\">veteran porn performer Ron Jeremy so eloquently put it</a>: \"Hey, dicks, it's really quite simple \u2026 No matter how you slice it, the viewers don't want to see them.\"</p> <p>Why is this? The fantasy of porn is that she is an object who exists to be penetrated, dehumanised and then disposed of. She has no bodily integrity, limits or dignity. She is not someone to worry about, care for or protect from physical harm. On the contrary, porn sex is about pushing her to her bodily limits, and then moving on to the next, and the next, and the next. Given this, it would simply make no sense for the men, during a porn shoot, to take the time or trouble to open a condom, put it on, check to make sure that it covers the penis so she won't be infected, and then start pounding away at her as if her body is a trash can. Condoms mean that she matters, and porn is all about her not mattering.</p> <p>Another big problem for the industry is that a condom would ruin the \"money shot\" \u2013 the term pornographers use to describe the final scene, in which the man ejaculates on to the body or into the eye of the woman. One performer told XBIZ: <a href=\"http://www.xbiz.com/news/134848\" title=\"\">\"Our industry depends on that shot!\" </a> The best explanation for this comes from the veteran porn actor and producer Bill Margold, who is quoted as saying: \"The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that, because they get even with the women they can't have. We try to inundate the world with orgasms in the face.\"</p> <p>For the time being, the outbreak of syphilis has spotlighted the dangers that porn performers face in the industry. This is a positive thing, but to reduce the debate to one of STDs or condom use obscures the larger issues that we face as a culture. The question we should be asking right now is this: what are the possible long-term consequences of living in a world where the major form of sex education for boys and men is provided by an industry that has time and again demonstrated a total disregard for the wellbeing of women?</p>",
  "<p>The foreman of the jury that awarded Apple $1bn (\u00a3600m) in damages against Samsung \u2013 the most ever in a patent infringement suit \u2013 has defended the nine-strong group after they reached their decision in just two and a half days.</p> <p>Velvin Hogan, 67, who has 35 years' experience in the computer hard drive business, said the jury had focused only on the evidence and had not ignored the 109 pages of instructions from the judge.</p> <p>As he explained the decision in a video interview on Bloomberg TV, Apple filed a legal demand to ban the sale in the US of eight Samsung smartphones named in the case, including the Galaxy S2 \u2013 and may be able to extend it to the flagship Galaxy S3, Samsung's highest-priced phone.</p> <p>The demand will be heard on 20 September by Judge Lucy Koh, who will have to decide whether Apple has suffered \"irreparable injury\" from their sale, that monetary damages are inadequate compensation, and that a ban on sale is not against the public interest. Koh has previously ruled in Apple's favour to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/30/samsung-galaxy-nexus-banned-us\" title=\"\">ban sales of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus</a> smartphone, though that was stayed on appeal.</p> <p>Hogan, meanwhile, said that when the jury began their deliberations \"I thought it was ultimately going to lean the other way [to Samsung]. It was at a stalemate \u2013 some jurors weren't sure of the patent prosecution process\".</p> <p>The trial saw three weeks of evidence, two and a half days of summation and two and a half days of deliberation before the dramatic verdict at the end of Friday.</p> <p>Hogan, who holds a patent himself, said that once he had been elected, the jury quickly settled down to a process where they worked through the 33 questions posed by the judge: if they couldn't answer a question unanimously, they simply moved on to the next.</p> <p>A 15-minute interview in which he <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/video/apple-jury-foreman-here-s-how-we-reached-a-verdict-RqtqHC25QbOBFg7xrWa5Wg.html\" title=\"\">explains the deliberations to Bloomberg TV</a> will surely be closely examined by Samsung's lawyers, who intend to appeal against the decision.</p> <p>Hogan insisted that there had been no \"home court\" advantage for Apple, despite the case being heard just 10 miles from its headquarters in Cupertino. \"I use no Apple equipment \u2013 I'm a PC person,\" Hogan said. \"My wife has a Samsung phone, but it's not a smartphone.\" None of the jurors owned an iPhone, he said.</p> <p>Another juror, Manuel Ilagan, <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57500358-37/exclusive-apple-samsung-juror-speaks-out/\" title=\"\">told Cnet</a> that the jury had been particularly swayed by internal documents yielded by Samsung, which showed executives had identified iPhone features to incorporate into Samsung's phones. The South Korean's executives, he said, had been \"dodging the questions\" when they presented video evidence: \"they didn't answer one of them. They didn't help their cause.\"</p> <p>Hogan and Ilagan have intensified the focus on the case, which is the second high-profile legal case this year to involve smartphones and patents in the US. In April, Oracle sued Google for $2.6bn, claiming that the Android mobile operating system infringed a number of its copyrights and patents \u2013 but was rebuffed when the jury ruled that Google had not infringed Oracle's patents. Oracle won nothing. None of that jury commented on their decision after the trial.</p> <p>By contrast, the Apple-Samsung case, also involving Android, is a dramatic win for Apple and has led some commentators to speculate that other handset makers could fight shy of using Google's software for phones in the US. Apple had sought $2.5bn in damages; the jury more than halved it. Hogan said they had estimated the damages based on \"reasonable royalties\" from figures provided by the companies.</p> <p>The jury, with experience in engineering, legal and financial work and including former staff from Intel and AT&amp;T, had some heated arguments, said Hogan and Ilagan. \"There was a 20-year-old who provided most of the debate,\" Hogan said. \"He thought very logically. He was never willing to take anybody's viewpoint until he had thought it through.\"</p> <p>But the crucial evidence, they said, comprised minutes of a meeting in Korean between Google and Samsung, at which Samsung executives were warned by the search giant to \"back off\" their designs from mimicking Apple's, and a 263-page internal Samsung evaluation, which compared Samsung's S-1 smartphone directly against the iPhone for functionality \u2013 with recommendations on how to make the S-1 more like Apple's.</p> <p>Hogan said that the jury did not calculate its record-breaking damages in order to \"punish\" Samsung, as he was quoted saying in an earlier report with the Reuters news agency \u2013 an action that could invalidate the damages, which are not meant to be punitive \u2013 but to remove any illicit gains made by Samsung.</p> <p>\"I realise how it sounds, but it wasn't 'punish'. In this country, intellectual property deserves to be protected,\" Hogan said. \"My real point was that if any company decides to ignore the stipulations and rules and gets so close that they cross the line and infringes and does so wilfuily, they need to understand if they take the risk and get caught, they should have to pay for it.\"</p> <p>He insisted that other smartphone manufacturers had shown that it was not necessary to ape the iPhone: \"there's other ways they could accomplish that \u2013 as RIM, Nokia, Motorola do. Just because they have the [An]Droid OS doesn't mean they have to be 100% the same [as the iPhone].\"</p> <p>Asked whether it was appropriate for a lay jury to hear a complex case on patents, Hogan responded: \"Yes, I do.\" He added: \"Because the reality of it was that while it was complicated, I believe that any jury of our peers could have reached this decision \u2013 maybe asking more questions of the judge; it would have taken longer \u2013 but at no time were we so confused that we felt we were heading in the wrong direction.\"</p> <p>Samsung's lawyers will disagree, and have signalled that they will take the case as far as the Supreme Court if needed to overturn the decision of Hogan and the others. But for now, Hogan's words have become law in the mobile marketplace.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2012. The original said Velvin Hogan's video interview was on Bloomberg News.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A revolution in medical research in Britain is to give academics and the life sciences industry unparalleled access to the cradle-to-grave health records of about 52 million people in England.</p> <p>Studies of NHS records first revealed the dangers of thalidomide; established an association between power lines and childhood leukaemia; showed autism had nothing to do with the MMR vaccine; and more recently highlighted England's poor cancer survival rates, a problem that lay mostly in late diagnosis. The result was a government campaign to raise awareness of early symptoms, such as a cough that lasts more than three weeks, with the <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/tag/be-clear-on-cancer/\" title=\"\">aim of saving 5,000 more lives by 2015</a>.</p> <p>Now ministers have overseen the creation of new systems to encourage a surge in studies that draw on public health records. From September GP practices will be encouraged to take part in the scheme, through the <a href=\"http://www.cprd.com/intro.asp\" title=\"\">Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)</a>.</p> <p>An uneasy question hung in the air when Britain banned smoking in enclosed public places. There was room for unintended consequences. Deprived of their usual haunts, smokers might light up more at home.</p> <p>In Scotland, where the ban first came into force, nearly half of five-year-olds lived with a smoker. The fear was that a ban intended to reduce smoking might increase exposure among children. But the enforced ban seems to have sparked voluntary smoking bans at home.</p> <p>Reassurance came when researchers trawled electronic hospital records for cases of children admitted with serious asthma attacks from 2000 to 2009, a period that straddled the ban's introduction in Scotland. Linking the electronic records together, all 21,415 of them, gave the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1002861\" title=\"\">first clear picture of child health after the ban</a>. The number of pre-school children hospitalised with asthma began to fall after yearly rises of 9% before the law changed.</p> <p>The government is now proposing to make this sort of study much easier to carry out. The CPRD will link health records on a scale never seen before, connecting patient information from GPs and hospitals to other records, such as disease and mental health registries and genetics databases. The combined datasets can be searched to answer medical research questions, and the results shared with scientists once they have been anonymised to protect patients' privacy. In time CPRD will add other records, such as pollution data, social care records and data from <a href=\"http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Biobank</a> \u2013 which is charting the health of 500,000 people \u2013 and hook up with similar systems that cover smaller populations in <a href=\"http://www.scot-ship.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Scotland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adls.ac.uk/secure-anonymised-information-linkage-databank/\" title=\"\">Wales</a>.</p> <p>The ambitious project <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/dec/government-boost-to-uk-life-science-industry\" title=\"\">redefines what it means to be an NHS patient</a>. There is, though, nothing new in using health records for research. For the past 40 years the UK has kept histories of all NHS patients, a feat no other country has achieved, and the resource has proved invaluable.</p> <p>Buried in the nation's health records is information that will save many more lives, and improve quality of life for others. Study of the records can reveal failing health services, rare drug side-effects, and pills that protect against diseases they were never prescribed for. But while some studies using health records go ahead, many never happen because the rules about sharing information are complex and applied haphazardly across the country. The obstacles can make researchers give up.</p> <p>\"The current system can be characterised by inconsistency, confusion and caution,\" said <a href=\"http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/professor-andrew-d-morris\" title=\"\">Prof Andrew Morris, chief scientist to the Scottish government</a>. \"If we want the UK to be the home of world class science, we need to sort these issues out.\"</p> <p>Under the new system anyone who uses the health service will become a research subject by default, their anonymised records being made available for study, unless they opt out. Ministers will rewrite the NHS constitution to presume patient consent.</p> <p>Advocates see a virtuous circle, with greater scrutiny of health records driving up quality of healthcare. But some critics argue that the collective good comes at a price to individual privacy, even when health records are shared anonymously.</p> <p>A consultation on changing the NHS constitution will run through the autumn, alongside a <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/02/dame-fiona-caldicott-to-lead-confidentiality-review/\" title=\"\">review of patient record confidentiality led by Dame Fiona Caldicott</a>. \"The CPRD has the potential to revolutionise research, make a real difference for patients, and allow us to become world leaders in the field,\" said <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/category/chief-professional-officers/chief-medical-officer/\" title=\"\">Dame Sally Davies</a>, the chief medical officer and chief scientist at the Department of Health. What she described as the largest and most ambitious scheme of its kind would allow researchers access to data on an unprecedented level.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/black.nick\" title=\"\">Nick Black</a>, professor of health services research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says there is an ethical imperative to use NHS records, which are gathered and maintained at taxpayers' expense. \"It's irresponsible and misguided not to maximise the use of these data, subject to appropriate confidentiality. These databases are dreadfully under-exploited and the public could benefit enormously if they were used more. It's an incredibly cost-effective way of doing research, and knowing what the quality of care is within the NHS,\" he said.</p> <p>Under the scheme scientists who want to study information held in patient records must first ask their local ethics committee, then send their research plan to the <a href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)</a>, which runs CPRD. If the study is approved by an independent scientific advisory committee the service links the required records electronically, performs the scientists' search, and pulls out the results anonymously.</p> <p>The first of two trials is underway. One study is comparing the long-term use of two drugs, simvastatin and atrovastatin, taken for high cholesterol. Unlike a clinical trial, the study will tests the drugs in the real world, where patients might be on more than one medicine and be less than consistent over taking their pills. The other study hopes to tease out whether antibiotics benefit people who suffer acute flare-ups of obstructive airway disease. Over the next three to four years the MHRA expects to run 500 to 600 studies annually through CPRD.</p> <p>Alf Game, the acting science director at the <a href=\"http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</a>, said the system has uses far beyond medical research. \"It is not just about medicine. Anonymised data sets of basic health and medical information about the population will be absolutely invaluable in increasing our understanding of successful ageing,\" he said. \"This kind of data would provide the whole picture, about absence of disease as well as the presence of it.\"</p> <p>While the majority of research will use only anonymised data, some studies will need information that can potentially identify patients, such as dates of birth and postcodes. These projects can only go ahead if patients give explicit consent, or when the health secretary grants an exception, for example, to protect people in the event of a large-scale danger to public health.</p> <p>Still, there are theoretical risks to patient privacy. The MHRA says it would, for example, give out only broad geographical information, far less precise than the first two letters of a postcode. But any health record that includes a handful of key episodes in a patient's life potentially puts their confidentiality at risk. A study of men over 60 in Scotland who had a detached retina in 1967 and retinal tears in 2009 might reveal other health details of the former prime minister, Gordon Brown.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/\" title=\"\">Ross Anderson</a>, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has used the Freedom of Information Act to try to force the MHRA to reveal how it plans to keep patient data secure, but received only <a href=\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/privacy_mechanisms_in_cprd\" title=\"\">partial answers</a>. He says that until the agency fully discloses its methods \u2013 a move he says will allow them to be scrutinised and tested \u2013 their privacy claims amount to \"smoke and mirrors\".</p> <p>\"The fundamental problem is this: If your GP record is sent to the MHRA, then even if they strip off all the personal ID and give you a random number, then somebody who knows about some episodes in your past, such as an appendix operation, or knee surgery, can zoom in on you. You cannot give out longitudinal records except with quite extraordinary amounts of care,\" Anderson said.</p> <p>On privacy, Davies said: \"Protecting the confidentiality of patients remains a priority, so all data is anonymised and people can opt out.\"</p> <p>How real the risk is hard to know. Only accredited scientists can use CPRD. They must specify and justify the information they need, and have a legal agreement with the MHRA to act responsibly. Data is anonymised and encrypted before it is sent, and no researcher can put CPRD data on a computer without it first having a certificate from the agency. The data can only be accessed by named researchers who have passwords and remote security access keys that generate a new code every 30 seconds. If foul play is suspected, researchers can be audited and whole institutions barred if bad behaviour is uncovered.</p> <p>Black said fears over privacy should not trump the \"huge collective benefit\" that sharing patient records brings. \"There has yet to be a single incident of anybody being harmed through the use of any healthcare databases. That's not to say there isn't somebody out there who is aggrieved because they somehow feel their personal information was used in a way they are not happy about. But this argument that terrible things might happen would be a lot stronger if people could come up with examples where somebody has suffered,\" he said.</p> <p>Though sold to the public as a means to improve healthcare, there is more to CPRD than that. The government wants to make money from Britain's NHS records by charging for access to the data. Within four years the system is expected to turn a profit, recouping the \u00a360m set-up costs in seven years.</p> <p>The MHRA will charge industry double the academic rate, with private companies paying about \u00a350,000 to \u00a3100,000 a study, depending on how much record linking needs to be done. The system can only be used for medical research, so drug companies cannot use CPRD for marketing, for example, by tracking down GP surgeries that are not prescribing their medicines. All projects that draw on CPRD data must be made public, usually through published journals.</p> <p>At the heart of the government's plan is a desire to entice global pharma back to Britain, particularly to conduct lucrative, large-scale randomised clinical trials, which can involve thousands of volunteers and attract fees of more than \u00a38,000 a participant. In recent years the UK has haemorrhaged such trials to countries where they are simpler, faster and cheaper to run. In Britain recruitment to trials can be frustratingly slow, because patients often need to give consent twice before they can enrol in a trial: once so their records can be checked to see if they are eligible, and again to invite them to take part. This \"consent for consent\" problem may be solved by another change to the NHS constitution to assume people are happy to be approached unless they opt out.</p> <p>Other systems will run alongside CPRD. This month a group of 10 UK funders, led by the Medical Research Council, <a href=\"http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC008799\" title=\"\">announced four new centres</a>, in London, Manchester, Dundee and Swansea, which will carry out research on linked clinical, social and research data, to investigate treatments and drug safety around diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and child and maternal health.</p> <p>Sir Mark Walport, the director of the Wellcome Trust, who in June was <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2012/WTVM055785.htm\" title=\"\">named as the government's next chief scientist</a>, is one of the most vocal supporters of research on NHS medical records. \"We can only have the best healthcare if we advance medicine through research, and part of that is about measuring the quality of healthcare, in other words knowing how well the NHS delivers,\" he said.</p> <p>Walport described the consent for consent situation as ridiculous. \"Most people would think that when there was research that was relevant to them, there would be a mechanism to approach them to take part. The question is then who makes the approach, and that has to be handled sensitively and securely,\" he said.</p> <p>Dr Janet Valentine, the head of public health and ageing at the <a href=\"http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm\" title=\"\">Medical Research Council</a>, said no other country had such a large and rich source of data on the health of its people as the UK.</p> <p>\"While research using patient data has been carried out for some time, the advent of electronic health records is enabling a step change in the type and sheer scale of research possible, especially when different large health data sets are linked together,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It's like the choice of taking a Kindle on holiday or a couple of books. We are already beginning to identify more effective treatments through the stratification of patients into those who will respond to treatments.\"</p>",
  "<p>Security contractor G4S is targeting developing markets in the hope they will take a more forgiving view of its bungled Olympics security contract than British politicians did, after it emerged the fiasco has cost the group \u00a350m.</p> <p>Nick Buckles, G4S chief executive, said the business would push on with plans to expand developing country contracts from 31% of revenues to 50% by the end of the decade, with Brazil, China and India the main priorities.</p> <p>He spoke as G4S confirmed it had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/27/g4s-nick-buckles-olympic\" title=\"\">taken a hit of \u00a350m on the Olympics</a>, at the top end of expectations, along with a 60% fall in first-half profits.</p> <p>\"I am confident that this will not have an impact on developing markets. As long as we continue to do a good job in the Paralympics, over time I think generally it will not have an impact,\" he said. G4S said it expected the Paralympics to run smoothly with no staffing shortfalls.</p> <p>\"We are confident that we have an assured security workforce for the Paralympic Games and do not anticipate any workforce shortfall issues to arise,\" the group said.</p> <p>Buckles said he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the London 2012 debacle, when the army was called in to shore up security after G4S was able to provide only 7,800 of the required 10,400 guards.</p> <p>The G4S figures for the six months to 30 June confirmed that the impact of the Games contract \u2013 which includes paying for the deployment of soldiers \u2013 will be at the upper end of an initial \u00a335m-\u00a350m&#xa0;estimate.</p> <p>Extra costs included laundry contracts signed by the Ministry of Defence so that uniforms worn on public duty were cleaned and ironed.</p> <p>G4S reported pre-tax profits of \u00a361m for the first half, down from \u00a3151m in the first six months of 2011. The profit drop was largely accounted for by the \u00a350m Olympics loss and \u00a324m in restructuring costs, which includes cutting 1,110 jobs from the group's 657,000-strong global workforce, with the majority of cuts occurring outside the UK.</p> <p>Buckles said he hoped to keep his job, adding: \"I have been with the company for 28 years, 10 of them as chief executive.\"</p> <p>A review of the Olympic contract furore, by auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, will help determine Buckles's future and is expected to report to the group board in the second half of September.</p> <p>Buckles said his appearance before the home affairs select committee shortly before the Games, where he was forced to admit that the Olympics process had been a \"shambles\", was difficult but necessary. One of G4S's major investors criticised the tone of the hearing, likening it to a medieval persecution. Buckles is scheduled to make another appearance this month.</p> <p>\"The home affairs process is a legitimate process. It was a difficult process for me personally,\" he said.</p> <p>Buckles denied that the furore had dented G4S's chances of securing more UK government contracts \u2013 thought to be a factor in whether he retains the CEO post \u2013 although he admitted the group had passed on a Department for Work and Pensions contract worth \u00a320m a year while it scrambled to get the Olympics situation under control.</p> <p>\"We have got a very strong track record [in the UK] and we believe that will stand the company in good stead for future government outsourcing business,\" he said.</p> <p>Three police forces \u2013 in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire \u2013 are considering outsourcing more than 1,000 jobs in IT and human resources to G4S.</p> <p>The firm said it had delivered 83% of the security shifts demanded under the Olympics contract and gave reassurances over the Paralympics, which start on Wednesday.</p> <p>More than half the job cuts revealed by G4S on Tuesday have taken place in developing markets, such as India, Thailand and South Korea, with 58 lost in the UK. G4S provides security work in more than 125 countries in a range of sectors, including courts in England and Wales, the European commission building in Brussels and Baghdad International airport.</p> <p>Louise Cooper, an analyst at brokerage BGC Partners, was sceptical of G4S's ambitions in emerging markets. She said: \"Why would anyone take the risk of awarding a contract to a company known to have failed so spectacularly when there are plenty of other companies offering almost identical services?</p> <p>\"G4S may either lose revenue as contracts are awarded to competitors or have to take a hit to margins as it has to undercut those competitors to win business.\"</p> <p>Buckles said the main benefit of prestige contracts such as the Olympics is to enhance the company's reputation, not to make money. \"Even with the Olympics contract here, we were not expecting to make a huge amount of profit from it. It was a flagship business for us internationally.\"</p> <p>But the uproar over the London contract has dented G4S's foreign ambitions, inciting the group to pull out of bidding for work on the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil and the Rio Olympics in 2016 \u2013 even though Brazil is one of three emerging markets that it is targeting, followed by China and India, where it employs 150,000 people. G4S admitted that it had also decided against bidding for a Department for Work and Pensions contract, worth about \u00a320m a year, due to the fallout from London 2012 problems.</p> <p>Buckles said the withdrawal from the World Cup and Rio Olympic contests would not cause serious harm to the company's developing market ambitions because the Brazilian security market is growing at a double-digit rate and throwing up numerous opportunities. \"The Olympics and World Cup were additional business that we hoped to get,\" he said. With no flagship contracts on the horizon, G4S expects to grow through smaller sized work such as airport security deals.</p>",

The interim government that will soon be chosen by the newly elected assembly will have to deal with the militia question if Libya is to become a state underpinned by the rule of law rather than one dominated by warlord factions.</p> <p>Just how many militias exist is unknown but estimates put the number in the low to mid hundreds. Their ranks are made up of thousands of young men \u2013 with many joining after the war ended \u2013 whose motives are complex and varied (the issue of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19364536\" title=\"\">pro-Gaddafi militias</a> is another matter altogether).</p> <p>Most are no doubt eager to secure a future for themselves and preserve <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/26/libya_sexual_revolution\" title=\"\">the respect</a> that now goes along with being a Libyan <em>thuwwar</em> (revolutionary). Others are more interested in the profits that come with controlling the trading routes along Libya's borders and other realms of the economy (militias in the east and west seized various businesses and private property after the uprising was over). It is a struggle that has led to clashes between militia groups.</p> <p>Still, their persistence also reflects a genuine desire to maintain security in their area of origin, something that the National Transitional Council (NTC) \u2013 the interim authority established during the uprising \u2013 was unable to do, partly because it lacked resources but also because it was viewed by western-based militias as being dominated by eastern Libyans and former Gaddafi officials who were mostly spectators during the fighting.</p> <p>At the same time, the militias have committed serious human rights abuses \u2013 including torture \u2013 against individuals and communities suspected of supporting the Gaddafi regime, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17053836\" title=\"\">as Amnesty International has documented</a>.</p> <p>The NTC tried to deal with the problem by bringing the militias under its rule. In September 2011, it created the Supreme Security Committee (SSC), a patchwork of various militia groups thought to number around 100,000. It also attempted to establish control over the Libyan National Shield, a group formed by militias from the east, Zintan and Misrata to preserve \"the ideals of the revolution\".</p> <p>In return for maintaining order around the country, the members of both groups were paid a salary that surpassed the average Libyan's wage, thus providing an incentive to continue fighting on the side of the state.</p> <p>The difficulty, however, is that the SSC and the National Shield \u2013 which have now become the assembly's problem \u2013 never came under the NTC's control and instead operated independently.</p> <p>In fact, their large numbers also threaten to overwhelm Libya's very weak military and police forces, both of which lack supplies and manpower. This would be less of a concern if they conducted themselves lawfully. But they haven't. Both have used violence to further their aims, have carried out random arrests and continue to maintain secret prisons.</p> <p>How to proceed? One possible solution is to strike at the heart of what has allowed the militias to retain their power: weapons.</p> <p>Three-quarters of Libya's arms are under the control of the militias who were able to seize the Gaddafi regime's deposits. While these include heavier items such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, militia fighters also hold many of the handguns, assault rifles and machine guns \u2013 put together, these apparently <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jun/21/libya-cracking/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">total around 20m</a> \u2013 that proliferate in Libya today along with the necessary ammunition. And therein lies the opportunity.</p> <p>The NTC <a href=\"http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/07/15/libya-s-militia-menace/csdq\" title=\"\">mulled the idea</a> of offering to hire militia members to serve in the military or police force and fund job training and even scholarships in exchange for them agreeing to quit their militia. The proposal never came to fruition but will likely be looked at again. Yet, rather than squeezing open government jobs, why not provide incentives that have the potential to create employment outside the state sector?</p> <p>This is what civil society actors in Mozambique did after its civil war ended in 1992. Seeing arms as a threat to peace, a \"<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fas.org%2Fasmp%2Fcampaigns%2Fsmallarms%2FSALWPaper.pdf&amp;ei=dqo8UP7kL8Kj0QWbl4C4AQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYjjK2MHzjKsm_raHcQLZyXnP9BA&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Tools for Arms</a>\" programme was started in the mid-1990s by a coalition of Christian churches.</p> <p>By handing in weapons \u2013 which were destroyed on the spot in order to calm fears over how they might be used \u2013 former fighters were given their choice of goods that had practical value. These included sewing machines, hoes, seeds, bicycles and household goods. In other instances, food was offered rather than tools. Close to 500,000 weapons and munitions were collected in this way over a five-year period.</p> <p>While its results were modest \u2013 Libya has millions of weapons in circulation \u2013 it bears repeating that the programme was run by churches. Indeed, it stands to reason that the Libyan government \u2013 flush with oil profits that continue to pour in \u2013 could organise something more concrete with the help of the international community.</p> <p>True, providing tools won't be enough. For it to produce real results, a weapons exchange programme of the kind described above requires the presence of stable transportation, communication and distribution networks that can sustain an economy \u2013 a particularly difficult challenge in any post-conflict environment.</p> <p>The more important point is that if Libyan leaders are to break the power of the militias and establish a cohesive military and police force that at least has the potential to be above petty interests by upholding a single body of law, then they will have to offer something tangible to those standing in the way.</p>",

Nor, the military announced, would any criminal charges be filed against the US troops who \"tried to burn about 500 copies of the Qur'an as part of a badly bungled security sweep at an Afghan prison in February, despite repeated warnings from Afghan soldiers that they were making a colossal mistake\".</p> <p>In doing so, the US military, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/19/afghanistan-american-imperialism-glenn-greenwald\">as usual</a>, brushed aside demands of Afghan officials for legal accountability for the destructive acts of foreign soldiers in their country. The US instead imposed \"disciplinary measures\" in both cases, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/world/asia/us-military-disciplines-9-for-koran-burning-and-incendiary-video.html?\">ones that</a> \"could include letters of reprimand, a reduction in rank, forfeit of some pay, physical restriction to a military base, extra duties or some combination of those measures\". Both incidents <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/world/asia/afghanistan-koran-burning-protests-enter-fifth-day.html?pagewanted=all\">triggered intense protests and rioting</a> that left dozens dead, back in February this year.</p> <p>Parallel to that, an Israeli judge Tuesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/rachel-corrie-ruling-deeply-troubling\">dismissed a lawsuit</a> against the Israeli government brought by the family of Rachel Corrie, the 23-year-old American student and pro-Palestinian activist who was killed by a military bulldozer in 2003 as she protested the demolition of a house in Gaza whose family she had come to befriend. Upon learning of the suit's dismissal, Corrie's mother, Cindy, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I believe this was a bad day, not only for our family, but for human rights, humanity, the rule of law and also for the country of Israel.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite Corrie's wearing a bright orange vest, Judge Oded Gershon, in a 62-page decision, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/world/middleeast/court-rules-israel-wasnt-at-fault-in-rachel-corries-death.html?_r=2&amp;hp\">ruled that</a> the bulldozer driver did not see her and her death was thus an accident. He went on to heap blame on Corrie for her own killing, arguing that, contrary to what \"any reasonable person would have done\", she \"chose to put herself in danger\" by trying to impede \"a military activity meant to prevent terrorist activity\".</p> <p>The commonality in all three of these episodes is self-evident: the perversion of the justice system and rule of law as nothing more than a weapon to legitimize even the most destructive state actions, while severely punishing those who oppose them. The US and its <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/53809/thomas-carothers/the-rule-of-law-revival\">loyal thinktank scholars</a> have long demanded that other states maintain an \"independent judiciary\" as one of the key ingredients for living under the rule of law. But these latest episodes demonstrate, yet again, that the judiciary in the US, along with the one in its prime Middle East client state, is anything but \"independent\": its primary function is to shield government actors from accountability.</p> <p>The US military has continuously imposed <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/story/2012-01-24/marine-haditha-iraq/52778126/1\">pitifully light \"punishments\"</a> on its soldiers even for the most heinous atrocities. The <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/01/2012123204949434335.html\">wanton slaughter of two dozen civilians in Haditha, Iraq</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/EFBB8B3C918A4F3E872570CE000D4425?OpenDocument\">severe and even lethal torture of Afghan detainees</a> generated, at worst, shockingly short jail time for the killers and, usually, little more than letters of reprimand.</p> <p>Contrast this tepid, reluctant wrist-slapping for the brutal crimes of occupying soldiers with what a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/12/bradley-manning-cruel-inhuman-treatment-un\">UN investigation found</a> was the US government's \"cruel and inhuman treatment\" of Bradley Manning before he was convicted of anything. Manning has been imprisoned for more than two years now without having been found guilty of any crimes \u2013 already longer than any of the perpetrators of these fatal abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan. He faces life in prison at the age of 23 for the alleged \"crime\" of disclosing to the world <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/24/wikileaks_23/\">overwhelming evidence of corruption, deceit and illegality</a> on the part of the world's most powerful factions: disclosures that <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/10/23/wikileaks_cables_and_the_iraq_war/\">helped thwart the Obama administration's efforts to keep US troops in Iraq</a>, and which, as even WikiLeaks' harshest critics <a href=\"http://ggdrafts.blogspot.com.br/2011/10/bill-keller-on-wikileaks-cables.html\">acknowledge</a>, played some substantial role in helping to spark the Arab spring.</p> <p>Notably, the first disclosure for which Manning was allegedly responsible \u2013 the videotape of an Apache helicopter gunning down unarmed Reuters journalists and then the rescuers who came to help the wounded, including two young children \u2013 resulted in zero accountability: the US military <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/04/military-releases-report-on-2007-apache-attack-and-questions-linger/\">exonerated everyone involved</a>. Instead, it is Manning, the person accused of exposing these crimes, who is punished as the real criminal.</p> <p>And herein lies the real function of the American justice system, clearly revealed time and again. It is to protect high-level actors from accountability even for the most egregious of crimes, while severely punishing those who reveal or take a stand against those crimes, thus deterring and intimidating any future opposition.</p> <p>That is the mentality that has led the Obama department of justice to aggressively shield all Bush officials from any and all accountability for their torture and surveillance crimes, while launching an unprecedented persecution campaign against whistleblowers. As always in US justice, the \"real\" criminals are those who alert the world to high-level crimes, not those who commit them. That is why the only person to <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2011/4/28/doj_drops_probe_of_whistleblower_who\">suffer any repercussions</a> from the Bush NSA eavesdropping scandal was Thomas Tamm: the mid-level DOJ lawyer who learned of the illegal program and alerted the New York Times about it. Those who authorized those crimes have been <a href=\"http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2012/05/08/nsa-whistleblower-justice-department-covers-up-crimes-of-obama-bush-administrations/\">fully shielded from any form of punishment</a>.</p> <p>It is this same mentality that has led the US federal judiciary to produce the most disgraceful political fact of the last decade. Not a single victim of America's \"war on terror\" abuses \u2013 even those now <a href=\"http://www.talkleft.com/story/2009/11/2/14325/8354\">acknowledged by the US government to have been completely innocent</a> \u2013 have been allowed even to have their cases heard in an American court on the merits. They've all had the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/23/federal_judge_complicity/\">courthouse doors slammed shut in the faces</a> by courts that have accepted the US government's claims that its own secrecy powers and immunity rights bar any such justice. Crimes committed by the state or in advancement of its agenda are simply immune from the rule of law in the US.</p> <p>The same exploitation of the justice system is glaringly evident in the Rachel Corrie travesty. As the Guardian's former Israel (and now Washington) correspondent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/rachel-corrie-verdict-exposes-israeli-military-mindset\">Chris McGreal writes</a>, the dismissal of this suit is simply a by-product of the \"virtual impunity for Israeli troops no matter who they killed or in what circumstances\". That's because Israeli courts, like American courts, have submissively accepted the supreme fiction of both governments: anyone impeding government actions is a terrorist or terrorist-enabler who gets what they deserve, while the actions of the state, no matter how savage, can never be anything other than legitimate.</p> <p>Cindy Corrie, Rachel's mother, said after the verdict that Israel \"employed a 'well-heeled system' to protect its soldiers and provide them with immunity\". Indeed, the Israeli \"investigation\" into Corrie's death has been such a laughable whitewash that even the US ambassador to Israel last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/israel-rachel-corrie-us-ambassador\">told the Corrie family</a> that he \"did not believe the Israeli military investigation had been 'thorough, credible and transparent', as had been promised by Israel.\" All of this, writes McGreal, shows how \"covering up the truth about the killings of innocents, including Corrie, became an important part of the survival strategy because of the damage the truth could do to the military's standing, not only in the rest of the world but also among Israelis.\"</p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/26/compliance-authority-failure\">noted on Sunday</a>, it is expected, inevitable, that those who wield political power will abuse it for corrupt and self-serving ends. That is why there are institutions designed to check and combat that abuse. The rule of law, and an independent judiciary applying it, is ostensibly one of those institutions. But \u2013 like establishment media outlets and most academics \u2013 this justice system now does the opposite: it is merely another weapon used to legitimize crimes by the powerful and crush those who oppose them. </p> <p>All three of this week's travesties, in the US and in Israel, are hardly surprising. To the contrary, they are the inevitable by-products of societies that recruit every institution in service of defending even the most wanton abuses by the state.</p>",
  "<p>A generation ago the proportion of qualified female building control surveyors working for local authorities was just 1%. Today, according to latest national figures, that number has risen to 7% with women still a significant minority in what has traditionally been seen as a male dominated profession. Now LABC, the organisation which represents local authority building control departments in England and Wales, is taking steps to further address the gender imbalance.</p> <p>In January LABC is launching a funded training programme to attract young people into the profession which it hopes will appeal especially to women. The scheme, which will offer training bursaries, has been designed in conjunction with the Association of Building Engineers. Local authorities, which must be able to offer the trainee a job, will provide workplace training for two years as trainees complete a level-4 qualification to become building control assistant surveyors.</p> <p>An initial 12 places will be available in January with a similar number expected to be offered annually. The scheme will also help fill the impending skills gap created by council building control surveyors who are in their 50s and reaching retirement.</p> <p>Anna Thompson, LABC's director of training, says: \"Back in 1986 there were just 26 of us working in building control who were women \u2013 you could fit us all into one room. The figures are starting to get better but it's still not great. I think you do have to be a certain type of woman to do this job \u2013 you have to be quite resilient and also practical, able to just get on with it. It really is a fantastic job and it should be easy to get people into it.\"</p> <p>Charlotte Halstead is the only female building control officer employed by Bradford metropolitan district council. After leaving school at 18, she enrolled in the council's building control apprenticeship scheme which it ran in partnership with four other local authorities in the West Yorkshire region. It was the only apprenticeship programme of its kind but has since wound up because of lack of funds.</p> <p>Halstead went on to study a part time degree in building surveying, funded by Bradford, and is about to start her final year. Once completed she hopes to go on to achieve professional membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Now 24, Halstead says: \"Before I became an apprentice I didn't know what building control was and I think that is part of the problem in terms of attracting young people.\"</p> <p>The role involves making sure that any building from a small loft conversion to high-rise office blocks and national sports arena \u2013 such as those erected for the London 2012 Olympic Games \u2013 meet statutory building regulations.</p> <p>\"We make sure that the constructions are safe and that they comply with building regulations. I get to go out on site and talk to all different kinds of people; architects, builders and the general public. Sometimes when I am on site I struggle a bit because I am a young blond girl and the impression some people have, although it's only a minority, is that I don't know very much. It's all about building up confidence and being able to say that what I know is right. I suppose I have had to prove myself a bit more because I am a woman.\"</p> <p>Local authority building control has traditionally had a male dominated workforce, especially tradesmen looking for a new career. Phil Hammond, chief executive of LABC, thinks the lack of women many have something to do with what he describes as \"the heritage of building sites of wolf whistles, lack of privacy and site toilets\".</p> <p>\"Building control shouldn't really be mixed up in that because it's a technical role,\" he contends. \"We are involved in the quality of the building and its performance in terms of health and safety There are jobs there and there are some really great female role models who have gone on to become senior managers. There is no obstacle at all for women who want to join the profession.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for analysis, best practice and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>My father, Tony Abrams, who has died aged 88, was a university lecturer, leftwing campaigner and inveterate conspiracy theorist. One of his proudest memories was of the 1996 Labour conference in Brighton where, he believed, he had been seated behind a pillar to prevent him from catching the eye of the chair. Despite this, he was able to respond to a call for \"the man in the brown tie\" to speak, and proceeded to make an unscheduled speech on transport. Responding to the debate, John Prescott joked drily that \"the man who thinks he's worked out how we can afford to renationalise the railways\" should see him afterwards.</p> <p>Tony lectured at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology for 30 years, and had degrees in mechanical engineering and in economics as well as a PhD in chemical engineering. But politics was always at the centre of his life. After second world war service in the Royal Navy, he joined Labour and a whole host of internationalist and anti-war movements. He was a veteran of the United Nations Association and was present at the launch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958. During the 2003 Iraq war he joined my mother, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/nov/10/joan-abrams-obituary\" title=\"\">Joan</a>, in nightly protest vigils on the steps of Stockport Art Gallery, even though he was almost 80 and increasingly frail.</p> <p>Tony's father and grandfather were both policemen, and his early years in Merton, south London, were a model of lower-middle-class respectability. He attended Rutlish grammar school, where he learned elocution from the man who would later give John Major the same clipped vowels. And while he rejected his parents' Anglicanism, he never fully abandoned their social attitudes. His political activism was always scrupulously law-abiding and his interventions \u2013 he was a frequent caller to Radio 4 phone-ins \u2013 always polite and measured.</p> <p>Joan and Tony married in 1956. After her death in 2009, Tony remarried and he is survived by his second wife, Sheila, as well as his three children, Judith, Julian and myself, and five grandchildren.</p>",

  "<p><strong>What motivated you to set up </strong><a href=\"http://operaincolour.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Opera in Colour</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>Opera in Colour exists to represent every colour on stage \u2013 it's not about whether you're black or white; it's about variety of voice. I come from a Jamaican-Indian background but I was born in London. I get into taxis a lot and drivers will say: \"I'd really like to go to the opera, but it's for posh people.\" I tell them I'm an opera singer and they say: \"No, you never. Give over!\"</p> <p>The \"opera is posh\" line is just stereotypical societal language. If you have that instinct that opera's posh, wouldn't it be best to go and find out whether it is? That's why I wanted to do Opera in Colour \u2013 when different cultures are represented on stage, it makes people question their assumptions.</p> <p><strong>How does it operate in practice?</strong></p> <p>We're a mentoring opera company. The Royal Opera House, English National Opera, Opera Brava \u2013 they all do brilliant outreach programmes, but it's about doing more than just making sure people are more aware and informed. For us, it started with a production called Why Don't You Just Sing Jazz?, celebrating black artists who have emerged from opera, which was a sell-out at the <a href=\"http://www.arcolatheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Grimeborn Festival</a> in 2009.</p> <p>So, say we put on Le Nozze di Figaro and we have young singers playing Susanna, the Count and Figaro. Each of them will be mentored for the time they are with us, and we let them know that they're not alone as they start out \u2013 that they have a sounding board for their career.</p> <p><strong>Why is mentoring so important in the arts?</strong></p> <p>In any job it's important because you get to engage with what's required for the job you want to do. Not only that but you get to see how other people have done it; what mistakes they've made so you don't have to make them and what they wish they'd done but didn't. I've been lucky enough to have Dame Josephine Barstow as a mentor \u2013 I did some masterclasses with her on the <a href=\"http://www.dartington.org/summer-school\" title=\"\">Dartington summer course</a>, and now I mentor three other singers myself.</p> <p>I don't even see it as careers advice; it's knowing somebody cares where you're going, and finding your true voice, which is very difficult to do if you haven't got somebody to throw ideas against.</p> <p><strong>Has singing always been part of your life?</strong></p> <p>I was brought up in a church so I was always singing. But when I left school, my teacher tried to get me a music scholarship and it just didn't happen \u2013 my mum preferred that I went out to work because that was the culture I was from. I started off in an architectural company, then went to work in corporate finance, and people kept wanting to promote me. I was working on a trading floor and a guy on my team wanted to promote me again, but I said: \"I really want to sing.\" So he said: \"Go and find out if you can.\" They kept my job open for me, I went out, ended up in a show and I never looked back.</p> <p><strong>What was the show?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/aug/01/theatre3\" title=\"\">Carmen Jones at the Royal Festival Hall</a> \u2013 I was in the chorus. Then came Porgy and Bess with Opera de Lyon, and it was there that I realised this was a real craft. I had an instrument but nowhere near the training I needed.</p> <p>So I sat down and wrote a business plan for my career, what it would cost for me to study opera, my books, my singing lessons, coaching, bills and rent for the year, my clothing even. I broke it all down, then sent it off to 150 people asking if they could help me \u2013 and one person said yes! With her money, I set up my own college: I chose my teachers, my coaches and my summer schools. Wherever I wanted to go and study, I went.</p> <p><strong>And you chose not to have an agent?</strong></p> <p>I don't have an agent, no, though I think I'm getting to the point where I'd quite like one. But what was a minus at the time \u2013 coming from the trading room floor \u2013 is a big plus now. It's allowed me to be more versatile. I've got to the stage where people ask me if I'm interested in something or whether it speaks to me, and I can say yes or no.</p> <p>As an artist, you've got to know yourself. You often hear things like \"my agent should be getting me jobs,\" but it's a partnership \u2013 you've got to work just as hard as them. Sometimes singers come to me and say, \"no one is giving me an audition,\" and my first question is: \"Do you warm up every single day?\" If you're not investing in yourself, why should anybody else?</p> <p><strong>How is the UK opera scene looking from where you're sitting?</strong></p> <p>I think it's a really exciting art form. There are lots of brilliant new composers and work. Think of <a href=\"http://www.tete-a-tete.org.uk/\" title=\"\">T\u00eate \u00e0 T\u00eate Festival</a> \u2013 Bill Banks-Jones and the work that he's just done is just amazing. Then there's Grimeborn, Glyndebourne and ENO. But as an artist, you have to make the opportunities for yourself. Ask yourself: what do you want to say? Then find a way to speak through the art form you're doing and you will find an audience. There's space for all of us.</p> <p>Darren Abrahams and Arlene Rolf are also running a professional forum called <a href=\"http://singingentrepreneur.com/\" title=\"\">The Singing Entrepreneur</a>, which Bill invited to be part of the festival this year. I was one of the speakers and you had Welsh National Opera, lots of big agents, young singers, and everyone hungry for knowledge and prepared to share it. Art is about speaking to people after all.</p> <p><strong>Do you consider yourself a leader?</strong></p> <p>I'm proud to be a leader \u2013 it's about being true to yourself and taking those risks you would want to see in others. A leader is also someone who is all embracing and all encompassing, who listens and knows when they're wrong. It's someone who knows when to say: \"Your idea is better than mine.

  "<p>A free school in Bradford has lost its government funding a week before it was due to open its doors.</p> <p>The One in a Million secondary school, run by a local charity and built on the grounds of Bradford City FC, is the latest free school to collapse after failing to attract enough pupils. Last month the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/18/free-school-withdrawn-lack-parent-interest?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">Newham Free Academy in east London was withdrawn from the coalition's free schools programme</a>. In June the Beccles free school in Suffolk had only 37 applications for children starting the new school year.</p> <p>One in a Million's co-founder Wayne Jacobs said he was shocked by the Department for Education's 11th-hour decision to withdraw funding. He said: \"We are completely baffled and stunned at this decision by the DfE and absolutely devastated for the parents, children and staff of the One in a Million free school.\"</p> <p>Nearly two-thirds of an initial 50 student places had been filled and the charity said it been assured by the DfE in June that its funding was on track for signoff by the education secretary, Michael Gove, but it was told last Friday that the department had decided to recommend funding should not be approved.</p> <p>Parents said the school's closure was a \"devastating blow\". Matthew Band, chief executive of One in a Million, added that he was amazed at the decision, particularly at such a late stage.</p> <p>\"It just doesn't make sense and we don't know of any other free school that has been put in this position with a week to opening and we will watch with interest to see which schools do open in September, their student numbers and capacity, and whether their facilities are permanent or temporary,\" Band said.</p> <p>Bradford is in the top 10% of deprived areas in the UK. One in a Million has set its sights on helping children from disadvantaged backgrounds, providing access to education, sport and the arts. Bradford council said all 30 children due to join the free school on 3 September would be found local authority school places.</p> <p>Free schools that receive government approval are given state funding for the costs of building or converting premises. They are run by faith organisations, parents' groups or charities. They are independent of local authority control.</p> <p>A DfE spokesperson said: \"Setting up a free school is a difficult task and we thank One in a Million for all their hard work. Before any new schools open their doors we have to be sure that all the conditions we set have been met. Making certain that new schools raise standards is one of the reasons why our free schools have been so popular with families across England. We still hope that One in a Million will open in 2013.\"</p>",
  "<p>Some economists believe that this summer could mark the moment when some of the eurozone's peripheral members may begin to be forced out; others think that such a scenario is inconceivable. All agree that, at least in the short term, a eurozone breakup would be disastrous for jobs and growth.</p> <p>But, because the outcome is unknowable, and depends on politics as much as on economics, let us leave that frightening prospect to one side and look instead at what we know about the underlying performance of the European Union economy. In short, how competitive is Europe in the summer of 2012?</p> <p>If we compare the EU-15 (the membership before the enlargements of 2004 and 2007) with the US, the most obvious point is that GDP per capita in Europe is almost 25% lower, a difference of around $11,000 a year. Furthermore, per capita EU productivity, which had been converging on the US level for 20 years up to 1995, when Europe was only about 5% below the US, lost 10 percentage points in relative terms in the decade preceding the eurozone crisis. Europe was unable to match America's significant productivity boost from the information technology revolution.</p> <p>But Europe managed to hold its share of global exports during that period more effectively than did the US. European companies have been more successful, on average, at maintaining their share of emerging-market demand than have US companies.</p> <p>Moreover, European job creation has not been as bad as many think. An analysis by McKinsey &amp; Company of new jobs in the US and the EU from 1995 to 2008 suggests that, while the US created 20m new jobs, 19m of them were attributable to population growth. The EU-15 created about 24m new jobs during the same period, with only 9m due to rising population.</p> <p>This job creation was not evenly spread across Europe, but it happened. That means that the EU now has successful employment models that can be emulated.</p> <p>There is also solid evidence that Europe's big companies have been competing relatively well globally. The number of Fortune 500 companies with headquarters in the EU has grown over the last decade, while the number of those based in the US has fallen. Moreover, big European companies' profits have grown 50% more rapidly than those of their American counterparts.</p> <p>Few deny the need for fiscal consolidation in many EU countries, especially in the south (and including France). But fiscal adjustment must be accompanied by structural reform. It is clear that the labour-market reforms undertaken by Germany a decade ago, painful as they were, have put the German economy in a far stronger position to compete globally. Similar reforms are urgently needed in countries like Italy and Spain.</p> <p>Service sector reform is vital as well. Manufacturing productivity per hour in Europe compares quite well with the US, but Europeans work significantly fewer hours per year, which explains the annual per capita difference. But European countries lag badly in services, where restrictive practices, protectionism, and inefficiency hold them back.</p> <p>The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and his Italian counterpart, Mario Monti, seem to understand these points, but the reform programmes that they have unveiled are not adequate to the challenge. Although Italian employers have dismissed the proposed employment law reform as far too modest, Monti's government has retreated in the face of trade union opposition and protests from assorted interest groups (like taxi drivers) eager to defend their privileges.</p> <p>Governments are inhibited by the knowledge that labour market reform may well result in a short-term increase in unemployment (and thus further fiscal deterioration), because employers will find it cheaper to fire personnel. The hope is that greater flexibility would also translate into a greater willingness to hire in an economic upturn.</p> <p>For EU politicians, however, the long term will be reached only after a series of short-term electoral challenges, so pro-reform governments may well not survive to reap the benefits. As Luxembourg's prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, remarked, all EU governments know what must be done; what they don't know is how to get re-elected once they have done it.</p> <p>Is there a way out of this dilemma?</p> <p>Countries such as Germany are adamantly opposed to a fiscal union, with a central EU budget for responding to asymmetric shocks, because they would be the chief contributors. But a variant that might elicit greater support would link fiscal support to labour market reform. If Italy or Spain introduced changes that led to a short-term increase in joblessness, the fiscal costs would be met from a central EU budget to ease the pain. This \"investment\" by wealthier countries should pay off if it leads to more flexible labour markets and higher productivity in the recipient countries.</p> <p>Another proposal is a central budget subsidy to reduce employment taxes in the EU's most economically challenged countries. The logic is that a country like Greece needs devaluation to enhance its competitiveness, but that leaving the euro would pose major problems. The alternative would be to cut nominal wages (\"internal\" devaluation), which is hard to do (though it has been achieved in Latvia and Ireland).</p> <p>Reducing taxes on labour, perhaps for a defined period, would have a similar effect. That would be costly for governments in the short term, though an increase in output and employment might well justify the \"tax expenditure\" involved; here, too, an EU subsidy might be a worthwhile investment.</p> <p>If Europe wants to revive sustainable growth and high employment, it must replicate what has worked in those countries that have performed successfully. Doing so will cost money. Governments must be prepared to persuade their electorates that it would be money well spent.</p>",
  "<p>Australian and European carbon markets will be linked in 2015, creating the world's biggest emissions trading market.</p> <p>Under the deal struck by Canberra and the European commission, Australian liable entities will be able to buy up to 50% of their carbon permits in Europe from 2015. In 2018, European entities will also be able to purchase credits from Australia.</p> <p>\"Linking the Australian and EU systems reaffirms that carbon markets are the prime vehicle for tackling climate change and the most efficient means of achieving missions reduction,\" said Greg Combet, Australia minister for climate change and energy efficiency.</p> <p>\"It means the EU price will drive the Australian price and that will effectively be the floor price in our system too,\" he said.</p> <p>The European commisioner for climate action, Connie Hedegaard, welcomed the announcement.</p> <p>\"We now look forward to the first full international linking of emission trading systems. This would be a significant achievement for both Europe and Australia,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It is further evidence of strong international co-operation on climate change and will build further momentum towards establishing a robust international carbon market.\"</p> <p>In Australia, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, Nathian Fabian, said the link between the two markets would please investors.</p> <p>\"We think investors will be pleased about the greater predictability this arrangement will give in the longer term for carbon pricing arrangements and of course, linking with a larger, more liquid market which is more established is also good for investor confidence,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Having schemes that are open and linked is the best way to ensure investors can find the lowest cost and the most carbon competitive businesses to invest in,\" said Fabian.</p> <p>Australia's carbon price, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/29/australia-carbon-tax\" title=\"\">controversially began in July</a> as a fixed $AUD23/tonne tax, will move to an emissions trading scheme in 2015. Originally, the scheme was designed with a $AUD15/tonne floor price (to take effect from 2015), a design feature intended to prevent the price crashing during the early years of trading.</p> <p>It was criticised by businesses because it was significantly higher than (current) international prices (in Europe the price is \u20ac8 or $AUS10/tonne). This meant Australian businesses would have to go through a complex set of adjustments to top up any international permits bought at a price below the Australian floor price.</p> <p>\"The removal of the floor price gives companies the chance to hedge their portfolios with European or international units and bank them in 2015,\" said Elisa de Wit, head of law firm Norton Rose's climate change practice.</p> <p>\"If you have the expectation that the prices will go up, it's a great opportunity to lock yourself in now,\" she said.</p> <p>But Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University, says linking with the EU trading scheme also has risks.</p> <p>\"From an Australian point of view, the EU is in quite some economic turmoil and it is somewhat difficult to judge what policy changes may be around the corner,\" he said.</p> <p>Jotzo says there's an expectation that the combined market price in a linked Australian-EU scheme is likely to be much more strongly influenced by decisions in Brussels and Berlin, than in Canberra.</p> <p>\"If the EU crisis was to deepen and there was a decision to go easy on climate change and let the EU trading price drop lower than it is already, that would be entirely incompatible with Australia's circumstances where greenhouse gas emissions continue to be on a strongly rising trajectory because of the continued expansion of the resources sector and commodity exports to China,\" he said.</p> <p>Australia is the world's biggest exporter of coal and iron ore. Australians also generate more carbon pollution per head than any other developed country, largely because of their heavy reliance on coal-fired power stations to generate electricity. With a population of 22 million, the country is responsible for 1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Britain, by comparison, with nearly three times the population, is responsible for just 1.7%.</p>",
  "<p>You have to feel for High Moon Studios. Two years ago the developer banged out Transformers: War For Cybertron, arguably the best video game to ever make use of Hasbro's transforming robot toys. It garnered some respectable reviews and did the business in sales, but most important of all, it rehabilitated the Transformers brand among gamers. Before War For Cybertron, Transformers was a byword for tripe in gaming. Then High Moon had to make a movie tie-in game for a rubbish Michael Bay film and the Transformers' gaming reputation was back at ground zero.</p> <p>I'm only bringing all of this up because when I mention to gamers and fellow critics that I'm excited about the arrival of the sequel to the War For Cybertron, I'm usually met with raised eyebrows. \"High Moon,\" they say. \"Didn't they make that awful Transformers game last year?\" Well, yes they did, but it's likely that the development cycle was miniscule and they were using their talents to portray the work of Michael Bay (shudder), rather than present their vision of the Transformers universe they so clearly love.</p> <p>I say \"love\" as this emotion is evident in every aspect of Transformers: Fall Of Cybertron. High Moon are not just a group of talented developers \u2013 as is evidenced in the game's mechanics, presentation and plot; they're genuine keepers of the Transformers faith. They know the history and the lore concerning the war between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decipticons.</p> <p>Their game mines the Transformers universe for all the potential it has while treating it will reverent respect. When you find yourself being able to reference in-game dialogue from Transformers: The Movie, you know you're playing a game constructed by thundering Transformers nerds \u2013 just like you! </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395488469\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/28/1346159740159/transform1.jpg\" alt=\"Transforms\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In terms of its plot, Fall of Cybertron picks up a couple of years after War For Cybertron. The Transformers' home world is practically a burnt-out husk and Energon \u2013 the fuel that powers both the planet and its inhabitants \u2013 is in very short supply. Both the Autobots and the Decepticons are making plans to leave; the Autobots are trying to secure enough Energon to power their Ark spaceship, while the Decepticons are researching a possible escape destination. </p> <p>Right off the bat, the world contained in Fall of Cybertron is far more impressive visually than that of its predecessor. In War For Cybertron, players often felt like they were travelling down the same metallic tunnel over and over again. The environments of Cybertron in High Moon's new game are far more varied and imaginative; players will find themselves battling on floating platforms in the clouds, ancient ruins shrouded in rust storms and sharp-edged tunnels filled with glowing Insecticon cocoons. </p> <p>Players will find a lot of the gameplay mechanics familiar. Like High Moon's first Transformers game, Fall Of Cybertron is an over-the-shoulder, third-person-shooter, which makes the occasional nod towards cover-based shooting, but never fully commits to it. Aiming and firing are mapped to the left and right triggers respectively, LB is a dodge move, Y switches weapons, X reloads, B switches the player's gun hand, A causes the robot to jump and players transform between robot and vehicle forms by clicking in the left thumbstick. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395488470\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/28/1346159772242/trasnform2.jpg\" alt=\"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The story mode is more character-driven this time round. Unlike the first game, in which players could pick from a couple of different Transformers, War For Cybertron assigns the player a specific Decepticon or Autobot to control. Each robot has a special ability that's mapped to the control pad's right shoulder button. Optimus Prime, for example, has the ability to call down a rocket strike from Metroplex. Megatron can hover in the air briefly and then slam his fist into the ground to send opponents flying. Jazz has a laser grappling hook, while Cliffjumper has the ability to turn invisible for short periods, enabling him to stealthily kill opponents from behind. </p> <p>The game's level design, in turn, compliments each Transformer's ability; the level involving Jazz, for example, has lots of platforms for players to rappel up to, while Cliffjumper's level has tons of air vents to trundle through and loads of enemies with stealth-busting vision to outfox. A couple of the levels feel a little undercooked \u2013 Soundwave, for example, doesn't really have much to do apart from eject Rumble and Lazerbeak \u2013 and the levels involving Bruticus and Grimlock are little more than fan-service power trips. Overall, though, the campaign is solid and an entertaining way to spend the roughly nine or so hours it takes to complete it. </p> <p>There are couple of niggles in the gameplay; too often, players will fire their weapons into cover when it looks like they have a clear shot on opponents and every Transformer \u2013 including hulks like Bruticus and Grimlock \u2013 dies just a little too easily. The rather fun campaign co-op mode from the first game has also been completely excised here, which may reduce the story mode's replayability. Apart from weapon upgrades and audio log collectibles, there's not really much reason to play through the plot a second time (apart from, obviously, spending more time with robotic heroes from your childhood). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395488471\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/28/1346159804109/transformers_main.jpg\" alt=\"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It's possible that the developers are hoping that the game's multiplayer and Escalation modes will keep players glued to it beyond the next few months, but whether this will prove to be the case is hard to call at this stage. Escalation is simply a riff on Gears of War's Horde mode and the competitive online mode doesn't exactly break new ground with its map designs or match-types. It's also worth pointing out that War For Cybertron's online lobbies are pretty much deserted at the time of this writing.</p> <p>That having been said, if you didn't play the last game's online mode and you're a fan of online shooters, Fall of Cybertron is certainly worth a look. The game's transforming mechanic puts a rather unique spin on your average online fragfest; not only does it look brilliant, it can provide players with a quick dodge and a speedy getaway when the tide turns against them.</p> <p>High Moon has also implemented a heap of customisation options for players who want to give their Autobot or Decepticon a personal touch. As players earn XP for blasting their mates online, they'll open up a whole new array of colour schemes and body parts for their bots, and the weapons they unlock become more diverse and satisfyingly brutal.</p> <p>Transformers: Fall Of Cybertron may be a bit of a hard-sell to players who aren't fans of the original cartoons, because it is, first and foremost, a game for Transformers fans made by Transformers fans. If I lost you earlier in the review when I mentioned Bruticus and Grimlock, then High Moon's game will appear to you as a solid, if hardly revolutionary TPS with an interesting shapeshifting mechanic thrown in for good measure. If, however, you know which one of the aforementioned Transformers turns into a fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus Rex, you'll be right at home here. </p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",

One solution that so far seems to have been overlooked by governments and the media in the impasse on WikiLeaks's Julian Assange since Ecuador granted him asylum is for the UK government to allow his safe passage from Ecuador's embassy in London to Ecuador's embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. This would meet all parties' obligations under both domestic and international law. The UK could meet its obligations to transfer Assange to face the criminal investigation in Sweden. Sweden could have the opportunity to pursue its investigations in Sweden.

  "<p>After holding events in San Sebastian, Spain, and Trento, Italy, <a href=\"http://manifesta9.org/en/home/\" title=\"\">Manifesta</a> the itinerant European Biennial of Contemporary Art, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/06/manifesta-9-art-mining-rich-seam\" title=\"\">set up in the former Waterschei mine in Genk</a>, once the industrial heartland of Limburg. The superb Art Deco buildings closed with the mine 25 years ago, leaving the region bereft. Now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/aug/06/mining-art-coal-industry-pictures\" title=\"\">they have been given a new lease of life</a>, and since Manifesta makes a point of using local context, there was no question for the organisers of ignoring Genk's \u2013 and Europe's \u2013 mining heritage. Manifesta 9 (until 30 September) therefore broke one of its self-imposed rules of promoting only young artistic creation and rooted this exhibition in the past. For the Mexican curator, Cuauht\u00e9moc M\u00e9dina, \"Limburg symbolises Europe in a nutshell, including its current state of crisis and change\".</p> <p>That is brought movingly to visitors in Sounds from Beneath, a video by <a href=\"http://www.mikhailkarikis.com/\" title=\"\">Mikhail Karikis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.urielorlow.net/\" title=\"\">Uriel Orlow</a>, who invited a former Kentish miners' chorus to sing an extraordinary lament in an abandoned mining landscape to the background sounds of forgotten machines.</p> <p>Of course, there are many young artists to discover too. They had been invited to explore de-industrialisation and energy use, or to interact with working-class memory. They accompany the ghosts of this fascinating site, and pay tribute to the heroes of an industrial hell who were cast off by an entire continent at the end of the last century.</p> <p>On the first floor of the old mining building there is a museum run by retired miners. It depicts their working conditions and tools. Rather than move the exhibition, Manifesta extended it by showing 19th- and 20th-century photographs and paintings of slag heaps and mining villages. The role played by coal in the utopia of modernity long propagated by artists, is shown by one of the first avant-garde documentaries: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jul/03/alberto-cavalcanti-film-director-ealing\" title=\"\">Alberto Cavalcanti</a>'s Coal Face, made in Britain in 1935, a robotic soundtrack composed by a young Benjamin Britten.</p> <p>Nemanja Cvijanovic has designed a monument to the \"idea of the Internationale\" when working-class pride was the pride of nations. It is a tiny musical box that plays the Internationale, and its fragile tinkling is transmitted through huge loudspeakers.</p> <p>The role of miners and workers is now all but forgotten now in Europe, but the young artists here have given them prominence again. A video by <a href=\"http://www.maryamjafri.net/\" title=\"\">Maryam Jafri</a> explores Iranian workshops that produce kinky leatherwear for export to the satanic west. The veiled women workers believe they are making garb for American soldiers in Iraq or straightjackets for psychiatric hospitals. In another video, Angels with Dirty Faces, Igor Grubic pays homage to the striking miners from Serbia's Kolubara mine who helped to bring down the Milosevic regime with photographs of miners with the silhouettes of angel's wings.</p> <p>The final battles in western Europe are represented too, starting with Orgreave in 1984, when thousands of British strikers and as many police clashed and brought about the end of the \"dirty faces\". In 2001 <a href=\"http://www.jeremydeller.org/\" title=\"\">Jeremy Deller</a> asked 800 of the strikers to re-enact and recall those events. The video he made provides numerous first-hand accounts and is a central feature in this Manifesta exhibit.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",
  "<p>Europe and the world are eagerly awaiting the decision of Germany's constitutional court on 12 September regarding the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the proposed permanent successor to the eurozone's current emergency lender, the European Financial Stability Mechanism. The court must rule on German plaintiffs' claim that legislation to establish the ESM would violate Germany's <em>Grundgesetz</em> (basic law). If the court rules in the plaintiffs' favour, it will ask the president, Joachim Gauck, not to sign the ESM treaty, which has already been ratified by Germany's parliament.</p> <p>There are serious concerns on all sides about the pending decision. Investors are worried that the court could oppose the ESM such that they would have to bear the losses from their bad investments. Taxpayers and pensioners in European countries that still have solid economies are worried that the court could pave the way for socialisation of eurozone debt, saddling them with the burden of these same investors' losses.</p> <p>The plaintiffs represent the entire political spectrum, including the Left party, the Christian Social Union MP Peter Gauweiler, and the justice minister in former chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Social Democratic government, Herta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin, who has collected tens of thousands of signatures supporting her case. There is also a group of retired professors of economics and law, and another of \"ordinary\" citizens, whose individual complaints have been selected as examples by the court.</p> <p>The plaintiffs have raised several objections to the ESM. First, they claim that it breaches the Maastricht Treaty's \"no bailout\" clause (Article 125). Germany agreed to relinquish the Deutsche Mark on the condition that the new currency area would not lead to direct or indirect socialisation of its members' debt, thus precluding any financial assistance from EU funds for states facing bankruptcy. Indeed, the new currency was conceived as a unit of account for economic exchange that would not have any wealth implications at all.</p> <p>The plaintiffs argue that, in the case of Greece, breaching Article 125 required proof that its insolvency would pose a greater danger than anticipated when the Maastricht Treaty was drafted. However, no such proof was provided.</p> <p>Second, Germany's law on the introduction of the ESM obliges Germany's representative on the ESM council to vote only after having asked the Bundestag for a decision. According to the plaintiffs, this is not permissible under international law. If Germany had wished to constrain its governor's authority in this way, it should have informed the other signatory states prior to doing so. On the other hand, Germany's representative on the governing council is sworn to secrecy, which, the plaintiffs argue, precludes any accountability to the Bundestag.</p> <p>Moreover, the plaintiffs claim that, while the ESM treaty is restrictive in granting resources to individual states, requiring a qualified majority vote, it does not specify the conditions under which losses are acceptable. Losses can result from excessive wages paid by the ESM governing council members to themselves, a dearth of energy in efforts to collect debts from countries that have received credit, or other forms of mismanagement. And, because governing council and executive board members enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution, misbehaviour cannot be punished.</p> <p>If losses arise, they must be covered by the initial cash contribution of \u20ac80bn (\u00a363bn), which then would be topped up automatically by all participating countries according to their capital shares. If individual countries are no longer able to make the necessary contributions, others must do so on their behalf. In principle, a single country might have to assume the entire burden of losses. Such joint and several liability, the plaintiffs assert, contradicts the court's previous statements that Germany should not accept any financial commitments stemming from other states' behaviour.</p> <p>Worse, according to the plaintiffs, although the liability of any country vis-a-vis external partners is limited to that country's share of capital, this limitation does not apply to other signatory states. It is theoretically possible that a single country could be held liable for the ESM's total exposure of \u20ac700bn.</p> <p>Finally, the ESM cannot be considered on its own, but must be seen in the context of the total exposure amount, which includes the \u20ac1.4tn in bailout funds that have already been granted. In particular, the Target2 credit drawn by the crisis-afflicted countries' central banks, which already totals almost \u20ac1tn, should also be taken into consideration.</p> <p>Nobody knows how the constitutional court will rule on these objections. Most observers believe that the court is unlikely to oppose the ESM treaty, though many expect the judges to demand certain amendments, or to ask Germany's president to make his signature subject to certain qualifications.</p> <p>It is good that the court's decisions cannot be forecast, and even better that the court cannot be lobbied or petitioned. The European Union can be based only on the rule of law. If those in power can break its rules on a case-by-case basis, the EU will never develop into the stable construct that is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity.</p>",
  "<p>Velvin Hogan, the foreman in the Apple-Samsung patent trial, has told Bloomberg that \"at no point\" was the jury confused about the task they had to carry out, and suggestions that the nine-strong group hurried to a verdict \u2013 reached after just two and a half days deliberating \u2013 are completely wrong.</p> <p>He said two pieces of evidence were crucial in persuading the jury that Samsung had intentionally copied elements of Apple's iPhone functionality: minutes of a meeting in South Korea with Google, which had warned senior Samsung executives to \"pull back\" from their tablet designs because they were too close to Apple's; and internal emails from Samsung executives which said that the difference between the iPhone and Samsung's smartphones was \"heaven and earth\", and that the two needed to be moved closer.</p> <p>Samsung executives had thus encouraged willful copying: \"In doing that, they crossed the line,\" Hogan told Bloomberg News. </p> <p>He also denied there had been any \"home court\" advantage for Apple, despite the case being heard just 10 miles from its Cupertino headquarters. \"I use no Apple equipment \u2013 I'm a PC person,\" Hogan said. \"My wife has a Samsung phone, but it's not a smartphone.\" None of the jurors owned an iPhone, he said. </p> <p>Hogan also said that in awarding the $1bn damages to Apple, they had used jurors' expertise in finance to calculate the loss caused by Samsung's infringement \u2013 which they estimated at 14% of the gross margin, far from the 35% demanded by Apple and only just above the 12% claimed by Samsung.</p> <p>He said the jury initially had been leaning towards Samsung's arguments as they began their stint in the jury room. The jury ranged widely in age \u2013 from Hogan, who is over 50, down to a 20-year-old who \"provided most of the debate\", Hogan said. \"He thought very logically. He was never willing to take anybody's viewpoint until he had thought it through.\" </p> <p>The jury included people who had worked at Intel and AT&amp;T, and had engineering, legal and financial experience.</p> <p>In working through the questions before them, the jury quickly fixed to a process where \"we convinced everybody, or we moved on.\" </p> <p>A key breakthrough came after the first day, he said, when at home he began pondering the role of \"prior art\" \u2013 pre-existing examples of ideas \u2013 in invalidating patents. Hogan, <a href=\"http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7352953.html\">himself a patent holder</a>, began considering Samsung's claimed '460 patent, covering the use of email in a camera phone, which it was asserting against Apple. </p> <p>He realised, he says, that Apple and Samsung's implementations were not interchangeable, meaning Apple had not infringed (The jury eventually determined that Apple had not infringed any of the five patents asserted by Samsung in the trial). When he explained that to the jury at the start of the second day, it led to a breakthrough in their understanding, Hogan said.</p> <p>Asked whether the jury had skimped on reading the judge's 109 pages of instructions in order to reach their verdict so quickly, Hogan replied: \"Before the closing arguments [by Apple and Samsung] the judge read to us the final instructions, instance by instance. We had those instructions, we had them open, and we went through patent by patent.\"</p> <p>Whenever the jury couldn't agree, Hogan would move on to the next question at issue in the case. The question relating to the '460 patent is the 25th of 33 in the judgement, indicating how quickly the jury moved through the list.</p> <p>He said it was easy to do so, though, because \"the judge broke it down by patent and for every accused device. She had broken it into groups. So we had to take the accused devices for each one, and compare them to the declaration of the patent, limitation by limitation.\"</p> <p>In an earlier interview with Reuters, Hogan had appeared to suggest that the damages awarded were intended to \"punish\" Samsung \u2013 which the judge had expressly said was not the purpose of the damages, and should instead be restitution for Apple's losses. </p> <p>However, Hogan said that was a misinterpretation of his description: \"I realise how it sounds, but it wasn't 'punish'. In this country, intellectual property deserves to be protected. My real point was that if any company decides to ignore the stipulations and rules and gets too close that they cross the line and infringes and does so willfully \u2013 they need to understand if they take the risk and get caught, they should have to pay for it.\"</p> <p>A key piece of evidence that persuaded jurors that Samsung had copied Apple designs and function was the minutes of a meeting between Google and Samsung in Korea. </p> <p>\"Google demanded that they were too close to Apple, and needed to pull back, because they [Google] were worried about their tablet and their operating system, and that they should make their tablet less like Apple's. They [Samsung] chose not to pass that information down to the engineers about that product, so they [the engineers] went on not knowing.</p> <p>\"The other thing was internal memos in the evidence where they were comparing the cellphones of Apple and Samsung, and an individual in Samsung said the difference is 'heaven and earth' and they need to move closer. They did move closer, but in moving closer they crossed the line. You can move closer without crossing the line.\"</p> <p>Asked about Samsung's reaction to the verdict, in which it said it was \"unfortunate that patent law allows the patenting of rectangles with rounded corners\", Hogan responded that \"we didn't look at any singular aspect\" of the devices when considering Apple's \"trade dress\" complaints of physical similarity between the iPhone and iPad and various Samsung devices. \"All of the claims and all of the limitations were taken in their entirety.\" </p> <p>He said he had previously thought that \"trade dress\" should not be patentable \u2013 but that my \"opinion toggled\" [in favour] as he considered the evidence. \"Putting the [Samsung] products side by side with the equivalent Apple products, it was clear to me and the other jurors that they were too close.\" </p> <p>The jury ruled that 12 of 13 phones, including the Galaxy S2, were too like Apple's iPhone 3G design, although they rejected similar claims about the Galaxy Tab tablet and iPad.</p> <p>Hogan insisted that other smartphone manufacturers had shown it was not necessary to ape the iPhone: \"There's other ways they could accomplish that - as RIM, Nokia, Motorola do. Just because they have the [An]Droid OS, doesn't mean they have to be 100% the same [as the iPhone].\"</p> <p>The jury, having agreed their decision, calculated the damages item by item based on a 14% margin. </p> <p>\"Three of us had been through the process in our careers of dealing with financial documents. I understood the profit and loss statements as well as the other two. We looked against the matrix of information [provided by Samsung about sales of phones and revenues]. We decided the [gross margin of profitability] percentage wasn't 12% [as Samsung had claimed] or 35% [as Apple had claimed], but should be between 13% and 15% \u2013 so 14% became the magic number. We then did our own calculations for each of the [infringing devices], along with reasonable royalties for each of the numbers.\"</p> <p>Asked if such a complex case was really best heard by a jury, Hogan was certain. \"Yes,\" he said. \"While it was complicated, but any jury of our peers could have reached this decision. If we had been asking questions of the judge it would have taken longer, but at all times we were confident that we were moving in the right direction.\"</p>",
  "<p>Marcelo Bielsa kept it up for 90 minutes. He squatted in the left corner of his technical area, got up, paced across the turf and squatted in the right corner of his technical area, got up again, paced across the turf again and squatted in the left corner of his technical area, pausing en route to take in the view from the middle. Standing this time. Over and over again. Every few seconds. Up, pace, down; up, pace, down; up pace, down. A different perspective, a better view. Except that it made no difference: whichever way the Athletic Bilbao manager looked at it, this was terrible. Truly awful.</p> <p>Monday night at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n and on 20 minutes, Bielsa saw Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's striker Radamel Falcao glide past San Jos\u00e9 and dink it over Gorka Iraizoz for the first. On 42, he saw Falcao replicate <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER4SxeMxKAs\" title=\"\"><em>that</em></a> Johan Cruyff goal \u2013 or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBXzCi801FY\" title=\"\"><em>this</em></a> Fernando Torres goal, or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQyoPQ_ijfs\" title=\"\"><em>this</em></a> Ismael Urzaiz one \u2013 by leaping in the air, side on to goal, foot raised half way to the crossbar, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlRo92tf8ok\" title=\"\">to volley the second</a>. On 58, it was three, all of them for Falcao, and on 84, it was four. It should have been more: Gorka Iraizoz made a handful of superb saves. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid had 14 shots on target; Athletic didn't have one.</p> <p>\"We were,\" Bielsa admitted, \"impotent in the face of the dimension of our opponent.\" The dimension of that opponent was gigantic: Arda Turan was consistently dangerous, Falcao's brilliance was barely believable and Atl\u00e9tico had destroyed Athletic in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/may/09/atletico-madrid-athletic-bilbao-europa-league\" title=\"\">last season's Europa League final too</a>. Bielsa talked of \"antagonistic styles\" and took the blame for not devising a strategy to impose upon Diego Simeone and his team. But it was not just about Falcao or Simeone or Atl\u00e9tico; there was something else, something deeper, something a little depressing. Something in that word: <em>impotent</em>.</p> <p>An inescapable feeling that Athletic Bilbao, the team that reached two finals and destroyed Manchester United at Old Trafford, are unravelling before his eyes.</p> <p>Athletic Bilbao are bottom of La Liga. It is only week two and last season Athletic suffered their worst start in 32 years but became possibly the most exciting, most different, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/oct/03/athletic-bilbao-la-liga\" title=\"\">most enjoyable team to watch in Spain</a>.</p> <p>There are three other teams with no points and a long way to go; Bielsa's done it before too. This summer, they had three players at the Olympics and two at Euro 2012. It was, some say, bound to take a while to re-find their feet and their fitness. They'll come good. But Athletic have conceded nine goals already and it just doesn't feel right.</p> <p>As Athletic's players filed out of the Calder\u00f3n late on Monday night, the last of them leaving the car park just before 1am, Javi Mart\u00ednez and Fernando Llorente were not among them. Both have told Athletic that they don't want to continue. Mart\u00ednez is waiting for a deal to be concluded with Bayern Munich, who have offered \u20ac40m (\u00a332m). Llorente, whose contract is up at the end of this season, will not sign a new deal and wants to go to Juventus. Fans have whistled and booed him at training sessions and graffiti has appeared on the window of the club shop. But despite standing to lose him for nothing, Athletic are refusing to sell, pointing at his \u20ac35m buyout clause. The window is closing. In the meantime, he's not playing.</p> <p>It wasn't supposed to be like this. They call Bielsa <em>El Loco</em>. As Iker Muni\u00e1in put it, he is not as mad as people say, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/mar/07/marcelo-bielsa-athletic-bilbao-manchester-united\" title=\"\">he is madder</a>. But he was also brilliant: he had revolutionised the team, changing the club's entire identity. They were <em>fun</em>. They reached two finals. They lost them both, completely running out of energy as the season entered the final weeks, but afterwards the fans chanted for the coach to continue. He was the architect of a new era. He was also non-committal. It took him a week to decide. There was a barely disguised panic: if Bielsa goes, we're screwed.</p> <p>When he did finally announce that he was staying there was relief. Athletic's project would continue and so would the players. But Bielsa's methods are wearing and the fatigue, both mentally and physically, among the players is real. His relentlessness has proven successful but it can also be enormously stressful.</p> <p>In early July it took a turn for the surreal. Bielsa called a press conference which lasted almost an hour and a half to announce that he had filed a formal complaint with the police \u2026 about himself. He gave a statement in which he admitted to having insulted and pushed the site manager on the works being carried out at Athletic's Lezama training ground. He said he had shoved the site manager out of his office after promises made about the completion of work were not met. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"he may well be the worst site manager around but he deserved respect.\"</p> <p>Bielsa had a point: the work was not completed on time, leaving Athletic without the facilities that he had demanded ready for pre-season training, the club had done little to push it through, and he was forced to act in the name of the club, having given them a four-day margin to sort it out. (And who in Spain hasn't felt like clobbering a construction company once in a while?) But he had also revealed the difficult relations that exist between him and the president. Athletic responded by publishing a statement in which they insisted that they \"do not share at all the personal and subjective opinion expressed by Marcelo Bielsa\", claimed that the work was being carried out \"correctly\", and pointedly referred to him as an \"employee of Athletic Club\".</p> <p>Bielsa opened a Facebook account to reply, point by point, to his club. \"I can accept that they have said I do not have the authority [to act as I have], but not that, directly or indirectly, it has been suggested that I have not told the truth,\" he said. \"My opinion about the quality, progress and the control and fulfilment of the work carried out at Lezama is not subjective. I can prove that each and every one of the things I said corresponds to concrete and verifiable facts \u2026 if no one made mistakes, why does the first team not have a place to carry out its pre-season in the timeframe agreed? \u2026 Why is it that the club and I see the same reality in different ways if we both work with good intentions for shared objective?\"</p> <p>\"This,\" he says, \"modifies our relationship.\"</p> <p>A sense of unease has taken over, a feeling that something could break any moment. There is tension in the air. When Athletic signed Aritz Aduriz and Ismael L\u00f3pez, Bielsa had no qualms in pointing out that he had not asked for either or them. And as the season drew near, both Mart\u00ednez and Llorente, Athletic's two best players, expressed their desire to leave. Team-mates understand their decision but there is irritation at how late it came; the season is two games old \u2013 two defeats, nine goals conceded \u2013 and still there is uncertainty.</p> <p>Bielsa says he has asked Mart\u00ednez and Llorente if he is the problem, implicitly posing the solution: \"If you're going because of me, I'll go first.\" He says they are not, but there has long been a private recognition that Bielsa and Llorente have important differences. This is an opportunity for them to move while they have suitors and lots of them: last season was probably unique and Athletic's absence from the Champions League weighs heavily.</p> <p>The bottom line for Athletic is clear: these are their best two players. Last season, Llorente scored 16 league goals. No one else got more than six. Another team debilitated. Every side in Spain that qualified for Europe has lost players this summer. And the fear now is that the departure of Mart\u00ednez and Llorente may lead to others following suit. Even the \u20ac60m they stand to raise is no comfort. Because of <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/sid_lowe/11/23/jonas/index.html\" title=\"\">their policy of signing only Basques</a>, the pool of potential players is limited. In transfer terms, the money is almost worthless. The Betis midfielder Be\u00f1at Extebarr\u00eda is the most attractive available player but Bielsa is not interested. On Monday night, he said he did not see the solution in signings. He needs to find it somewhere.</p> <p>\"Of course I'm worried,\" the coach said, \"It's impossible for a team like this to be in the position it's in and not be worried about it.\"</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 When Florentino P\u00e9rez arrived in the directors' box at the Coliseum, it all looked so very good; by the time he departed again, it all looked so very bad. The TV screens in the front row were showing the game from Pamplona, where Barcelona \u2013 apparently playing in Sunny Delight bottles \u2013 were losing 1-0 to Osasuna. Their play was almost as bad as their kit, too. Beat Getafe and Madrid would climb back above their rivals. But Leo Messi scored twice \u2013 that's four for the season already \u2013 to rescue Barcelona and Madrid blew a 1-0 lead to lose 2-1 in front of less than 10,000 fans. That's three games without a win at the start of the season for Madrid \u2013 something that has never happened to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho before \u2013 and a five-point gap between them and Barcelona. Yes, it's early but considering that Madrid only dropped 14 points in the whole of last season it is significant. The performance was, Mourinho said, \"unacceptable\".</p> <p>\u2022 Valencia won on Saturday, Deportivo won on Sunday and the aggregate score was a draw. 3-1 up at half-time, which ended at midnight, Valencia conceded two second-half goals. Half-time team talk? Tomorrow is another day?</p> <p>\u2022 It's a Barcelona-Madrid one-two at the top. The Madrid team in question, though, are Rayo Vallecano \u2013 two wins from two, they sit second, thanks to a brilliant performance of a Leo of their own. This one's Brazilian and only started playing 11-a-side football a couple of years ago.</p> <p>\u2022 Falcao: wow.</p> <p>\u2022 M\u00e1laga-Mallorca: pyjama party.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Real Sociedad 2-1 Celta Vigo, Betis 1-2 Rayo Vallecano, Espanyol 1-2 Zaragoza, M\u00e1laga 1-1 Mallorca, Osasuna 1-2 Barcelona, Getafe 2-1 Real Madrid, Granada 1-1 Sevilla, Valencia 3-3 Deportivo, Atl\u00e9tico 4-0 Athletic, Valladolid 2-0 Levante.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29\" title=\"\">Latest La Liga standings</a></p>",

Watch here</a></p> <p>It's more than 100 years since Anna Pavlova chose to leave Russia and make London her home. Some of the most <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KppDk6ZYTDQ\">iconic pictures</a> ever taken of the Russian ballerina, including those with her pet swans, were shot at her home, the rambling Ivy House, in Highgate. Ivy House was also the base from which Pavlova ran her ballet school, training the young girls who hoped one day to join the ranks of her touring company.</p> <p>Pavlova's touring was in itself a phenomenon. Other ballerinas before her had traipsed the world in search of audiences. But once she had severed links with St Petersburg, Pavlova travelled ernomous distances \u2013 to North and South America, to India, Japan and Australia \u2013 continuing to dance almost up to the day of her death in 1931.</p> <p>She became the most famous ballerina of her generation \u2013 also one of the most lovingly documented. The BFI has just completed a season stocked with footage of her life and career. But there are also rich pickings on YouTube, including a precious record of her dancing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxewIq7DG3A\">The Dying Swan</a>, the solo choreographed for her by Mikhail Fokine in 1907, which she retained as her signature piece for rest of her life, reputedly dancing it 4,000 times.</p> <p>Shot in 1925, the film registers the physical distance between Pavlova and contemporary ballerinas \u2013 she doesn't stretch her feet or turn out her legs to the degree that is expected today. If you compare her with Uliana Lopatkina dancing the same solo now, it's fascinating to see how much more dramatic, even melodramatic, Pavlova's phrasing looks; how broken and crumpled the lines of her body as the Swan falters; how frantic the fluttering speed of her arms. Alongside the immaculately composed Lopatkina she looks almost like a silent screen heroine.</p> <p>Yet Pavlova also looks peculiarly modern. She was mocked at school for the extreme slenderness of her limbs, and for her pale face and dark eyes \u2013 the antithesis of the tough, plumply pretty ballerinas who ruled the Mariinsky in the early 20th century. Yet by the 1930s, Pavlova's rarified physique had set the template for ballerina beauty.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/faBrXateGQU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/faBrXateGQU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faBrXateGQU_embedded\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>Almost everyone who watched her perform remained haunted by her image. Choreographer Frederick Ashton, who saw Pavlova dance when he was a schoolboy in South America, swore it was she who inspired his choreographic career (many thought he truly wished he could have been her).</p> <p>Ashton found Pavlova's arms and hands particularly expressive: the clip above of her dancing in the 1916 feature film The Dumb Girl of Portici (in which she is supported by an invisible partner) highlights the floating, romantic quality of her arms, the infinitely subtle musical extension of a phrase all the way through to her fingertips that made her such an acclaimed interpreter of roles such as Giselle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LpMJkntY1zs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LpMJkntY1zs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpMJkntY1zs_embedded\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>Interestingly, in this 1925 clip of her Dionysus solo, the flattened Grecian poses of Pavlova's body, the ecstatic quality of her runs and the flying lines of drapery bear fleeting resemblance to Isadora Duncan, Ashton's other idol and, like Pavlova, one of the major influences on dance sensibility of the time.</p> <p>Pavlova could be a shocking diva: one of her partners, Mikhail Mordkin, found himself being slapped round the face in the middle of a <em>pas de deux</em> because Pavlova believed he had bungled a lift. But what she gave to her public was the passionate investment in her dancing. In the 1915 footage below of her solo, The Dragonfly, the quivering intensity of Pavlova's arm movements and the darting, almost inhuman rhythms of her upper body, reveal her ability to transform herself into the material she was dancing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AyDiLBSbKio?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AyDiLBSbKio\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyDiLBSbKio&amp;feature=fvsts_embedded\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>Often the work she created herself was inspired by nature rather than people. Although Pavlova found security with her common-law husband Victor Dandre, it seemed to many that she never cared for another person as much as she cared for her animals and birds. Or for the art form for which she lived and died.</p>",

  "<p>Reporters covering Israel are routinely confronted with the question: why not call Hamas a terrorist organisation? It's a fair point. How else to describe blowing up families on buses but terrorism?</p> <p>But the difficulty lies in what then to call the Israeli army when it, too, at particular times and places, has used indiscriminate killing and terror as a means of breaking Palestinian civilians. One of those places was Rafah, in the southern tip of the Gaza strip, where Rachel Corrie was crushed by a military bulldozer nine years ago as she tried to stop the Israeli army going about its routine destruction of Palestinian homes.</p> <p>An Israeli judge on Tuesday perpetuated the fiction that Corrie's death was a terrible accident and upheld the results of the military's own investigation, widely regarded as such a whitewash that even the <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-israeli-probe-into-rachel-corrie-s-death-wasn-t-credible.premium-1.460091\">US ambassador to Israel described it as neither thorough nor credible</a>. Corrie's parents may have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/rachel-corrie-ruling-deeply-troubling\">failed in their attempt to see some justice for their daughter</a>, but in their struggle they forced a court case that established that her death was not arbitrary but one of a pattern of killings as the Israeli army pursued a daily routine of attacks intended to terrorise the Palestinian population of southern Gaza into submission.</p> <p>The case laid bare the state of the collective Israeli military mind, which cast the definition of enemies so widely that children walking down the street were legitimate targets if they crossed a red line that was invisible to everyone but the soldiers looking at it on their maps. The military gave itself a blanket protection by declaring southern Gaza a war zone, even though it was heavily populated by ordinary Palestinians, and set rules of engagement so broad that just about anyone was a target.</p> <p>With that went virtual impunity for Israeli troops no matter who they killed or in what circumstances \u2013 an impunity reinforced by Tuesday's verdict in Haifa.</p> <p>The Israeli military commander in southern Gaza at the time was Colonel Pinhas \"Pinky\" Zuaretz. A few weeks after Corrie's death, I (as the Guardian's correspondent in Israel) spoke to him about how it was that so many children were shot by Israeli soldiers at times when there was no combat. His explanation was chilling.</p> <p>At that point, three years into the second intifada, more than 400 children had been killed by the Israeli army. Nearly half were in Rafah and neighbouring Khan Yunis. One in four were under the age of 12.</p> <p>I focussed on the deaths of six children in a 10-week period, all in circumstances far from combat. The dead included a 12-year-old girl, Haneen Abu Sitta, killed in Rafah as she walked home from school near a security fence around one of the fortified Jewish settlements in Gaza at the time. The army made up an explanation by falsely claiming Haneen was killed during a gun battle between Israeli forces and Palestinians. </p> <p>Zuaretz conceded to me that there was no battle and that the girl was shot by a soldier who had no business opening fire. It was the same with the killings of some of the other children. The colonel was fleetingly remorseful.</p> <p>\"Every name of a child here, it makes me feel bad because it's the fault of my soldiers. I need to learn and see the mistakes of my troops,\" he said. But Zuaretz was not going to do anything about it; and by the end of the interview, he was casting the killings as an unfortunate part of the struggle for Israel's very survival.</p> <p>\"I remember the Holocaust. We have a choice, to fight the terrorists or to face being consumed by the flames again,\" he said.</p> <p>In court, Zuaretz said the whole of southern Gaza was a combat zone and anyone who entered parts of it had made themselves a target. But those parts included houses where Palestinians built <em>walls within walls</em> in their homes to protect themselves from Israeli bullets.</p> <p>In that context, covering up the truth about the killings of innocents, including Corrie, became an important part of the survival strategy because of the damage the truth could do to the military's standing, not only in the rest of the world but also among Israelis.</p> <p>The death of Khalil al-Mughrabi two years before Corrie died was telling. The 11-year-old boy was playing football when he was shot dead in Rafah by an Israeli soldier. The respected Israeli human rights organisations, B'Tselem, wrote to the army demanding an investigation. Several months later, the judge advocate general's office wrote back saying that Khalil was killed by soldiers who had acted with \"restraint and control\" to disperse a riot in the area.</p> <p>But the judge advocate general's office made the mistake of attaching a copy of its own confidential investigation, which came to a very different conclusion: that the riot had been much earlier in the day and the soldiers who shot the child should not have opened fire. In the report, the chief military prosecutor, Colonel Einat Ron, then spelled out alternative false scenarios that should be offered to B'Tselem. The official account was a lie and the army knew it.</p> <p>The message to ordinary soldiers was clear: you have a free hand because the military will protect you to protect itself. It is that immunity from accountability that was the road to Corrie's death.</p> <p>She wasn't the only foreign victim at about that time. In the following months, Israeli soldiers shot dead James Miller, a British television documentary journalist, and Tom Hurndall, a British photographer and pro-Palestinian activist. In November 2002, an Israeli sniper had killed a British United Nations worker, Iain Hook, in Jenin in the West Bank.</p> <p>British inquests returned verdicts of unlawful killings in all three deaths, but Israel rejected calls for the soldiers who killed Miller and Hook to be held to account. The Israeli military initially whitewashed Hurndall's killing but after an outcry led by his parents, and British government pressure, the sniper who shot him was sentenced to eight years in prison for manslaughter. </p> <p>That sentence apparently did nothing to erode a military mindset that sees only enemies.</p> <p>Three years after Corrie's death, an Israeli army officer who emptied the magazine of his automatic rifle into a 13-year-old Palestinian girl, Iman al-Hams, and then said he would have done the same even if she had been three years old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/16/israel2\">was cleared by a military court</a>.</p> <p>Iman was shot and wounded after crossing the invisible red line around an Israeli military base in Rafah, but she was never any closer than 100 yards. The officer then left the base in order to \"confirm the kill\" by pumping the wounded girl full of bullets. An Israeli military investigation concluded he had acted properly.</p> <p>Tuesday's court verdict in Haifa will have done nothing to end that climate of impunity. Nor anything that would have us believe that Israel's repeated proclamation that it has the \"most moral army in the world\" is any more true than its explanation of so many Palestinian deaths.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this article will be on for 24 hours and may be turned off overnight</p>",
  "<p>I really enjoyed the huge amount of exuberant, playful, clever imagination in these stories. And the large number of remarkable mothers \u2013 one who thinks so much her head explodes, another who is an alien, and a third who, to the consternation of the main character's father, is flying to America to get married. </p> <p>I was impressed by how few of these stories were imitations of the familiar stories we've all read a hundred times. Guardian readers obviously prefer the original and the unexpected in their stories. Well done to all the writers.</p> <p><strong>Winner 7 to 11 years: Rose Burdon, age 9</strong></p> <p>I love Rose's character Sophie, who doesn't believe in half measures when it comes to getting herself expelled from a series of schools. I also love that her mum doesn't mind and that her dad is driven to desperation. But most of all I love the line, \"Harwood was the most awful, scary, strict, boring, posh, horrible school that you can possibly imagine.\" Only a good writer would put that \"posh\" in there.</p> <p><strong>Read Rose's story:</strong></p> <p>Dad was flabbergasted when I told him the news\u2026 \"You were what?\" he thundered, his face turning redder by the second. \"But you can't have been, you've only been there a week!\"</p> <p>Mum was humming a joyful tune not at all concerned about my news. \"It's not too bad dear,\" she said, patting Dad on the back. \"Do calm down you look like a beetroot. Now Sophie dearest, as you've no school tomorrow shall we go shopping?\"</p> <p>Dad was now shaking with rage and bellowed \"What 's wrong with the pair of you \u2013 Sophie you've just been expelled from the fifth school you've been to this year - and Sarah, you're her mother! We should punish her, not take her shopping! Sophie WHAT DID YOU DO?\"</p> <p>\"I was only being artistic,\" I said, defensively. \"I painted my name beautifully in pinks and greens and really brightened up the grey school walls.\"</p> <p>Mum burst out laughing. \"I quite agree Sophie, it was a miserable school.\"</p> <p>Dad looked as if he might explode he was so angry. He held up his hand and counted on his fingers:</p> <p>\"School 1 \u2013 You stole your teachers car, crashed it and ran over her cat. </p> <p>School 2 \u2013 You crept into the kitchens dressed as a ghost and frightened the cook who set her hair on fire. </p> <p>School 3 \u2013 You poured syrup over the chairs in the staff room and put exploding coke bottles in the teachers fridge. </p> <p>School 4 - You sent letters to the parents saying that school would be closed for a week due to the very contagious and dangerous Teacherlitis disease.</p> <p>School 5 \u2013 Graffiti! ... Well that's it.\" Dad was really yelling now. \"You're going to Harddown boarding school tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Mum and I froze. \"No!\" I said in a very small voice. Harwood was the most awful, scarey, strict, boring, posh, horrible school that you can possibly imagine.</p> <p>\"Oh please no,\" cried Mum.</p> <p>\"You both need to be taught a lesson and if you make a fuss Sarah I'll send you to boarding school too.\"</p> <p>Dad stomped away leaving me and mum crying in the kitchen. </p> <p>The next morning my eyes were bloodshot and blotchy from crying. At 9am Mum and Dad drove me to Hardwood. I walked slowly into my new school dragging my heavy greyish bag behind me. Nothing could be worse. I walked straight into assembly and the whole school looked at me. Just then Mum ran up to headmaster, grabbed his hands tightly and started to dance very fast.</p> <p>I was more embarrassed than is possible. Dad rushed over and dragged Mum away and I heard the doors lock behind them. I wanted the ground to swallow me up whole.</p> <p>When I looked up the headmistress was staring at me with steely eyes. Then she blew a loud whistle, disco lights flashed, music started playing and the whole school started dancing.</p> <p>\"With a mother like that,\" the headmistress said, \"You'll do fine here, welcome to Hardwood boarding school!\"</p> <p><strong>Winner 12 to 14 years: Pastora Morgan, age 12</strong></p> <p>Pastora's story has a simple structure, but it skillfully explores a very important moment in the main character's life. As Molly is questioned by her father about the gold locket she claims to have found, we are reminded that for some people the choice between right and wrong is a complicated one. The physical details of the scene are strong and vivid, which makes the emotion of the ending even more powerful.</p> <p><strong>Read Pastora's story:</strong></p> <p>My dad was flabbergasted when I told him the news; there was a loud clatter as the armful of kindling he'd been carrying fell to the floor. He turned to face me, eyes transfixed on the object swinging in my hand.</p> <p>\"Where'd ya get it?\" He asked suspiciously. \"Molly, I told you before not to go pinchin' things. We can't sell the stolen stuff, it just brings us trouble. God knows we're doin' bad enough as it is-.\"</p> <p>\"Pa!\" I interrupted.</p> <p>\"I ain't stolen nothin'!\"</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows at me.</p> <p>\"Where'd ya get it from then?\"</p> <p>\"I found it.\"</p> <p>He laughed, snidely.</p> <p>\"I did, honest! I was up the Thames with the other mudlarks this morning. Thought we'd go to the quay for a change. Me an' Lizzie were fightin' over a net caught on one of the barges when I saw something glintin'; all tangled up in the rope it was. I dived under for it. Ya should have seen Lizzie's face when I came up with the locket, an' her just standin' there all wet and holdin' a ripped fisher's net!\"</p> <p>He stared incredulously, then stepped towards me, scrutinising my face for any sign of a lie. There was a long silence as he scratched his beard thoughtfully. I held my breath ...</p> <p>\"Well you can't sell it to ol' Pilcher. He'll never give you a fair price.\" He smiled, and I gulped a relieved lungful of air.</p> <p>\"I know a pawnbroker up Market Street. We can go there tomorrow; he'll give us a good price. That beauty will fetch a fair few coppers\u2026\" he paused.</p> <p>\"Can I see it?\" he asked, nodding at the locket. I held it out to him.</p> <p>Even in the dim light given off by the dusty oil lamp it shimmered, the gold case scattering ripples of light across the walls. He held it up to his eyes, his thumbs tracing the delicate silver roses which swirled around the clasp. His thick stubby fingers fumbled between the rose petals, and a dirty yellow nail drove between the rims snapping the locket open in his calloused hand.</p> <p>\"There ain't no portrait\" he said frowning.</p> <p>\"No. There weren't nothin' in it when I found it.\"</p> <p>\"I wonder why they threw it out?\" he asked, watching my face carefully.</p> <p>I shrugged feigning innocence as I slid one hand into my pocket to check that the crumpled miniature was still there. It was the likeness of a baby, the Lady Mary, daughter of the Duchess, it was the only portrait of her ever painted, finished just days before she died. The Duchess must have noticed the locket was missing by now, but I doubted she would even remember the beggar girl she had stopped to toss a copper at.</p> <p>I heard my brother coughing next door, his wheezing cutting agonisingly through me. He was dying. The locket would buy medicine. What was a picture of a dead child worth, if it could buy another's life?</p>",
  "<p>Tom Sharpe meets <em>Watership Down</em> in the hugely enjoyable story of Basil \"Banger\" Peyton-Crumbe, a man who, having exulted in the slaughter of gamebirds all his life and neglected his wife and child, is killed in a shooting accident and reincarnated as a pheasant. Here all animals can communicate with each other but not with humans. Dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, insects: all trade insults, pass on news or plead for their lives; faithful pets feel acute frustration at being unable to get through to their slow-witted owners. In his new body, once-murderous Banger uses his old hunting knowhow to try to minimise the slaughter of his avian brethren, while the local plod's dog makes a better fist of solving the case of Banger's death than his master. It would not be quite accurate to say the book anthropomorphises animals because they all retain, quite brilliantly, their animal natures, but at the same time Banger, even as a dim bird, begins to gain insights into his shortcomings as a human being. Funny, astute and completely absorbing.</p>",

  "<p>A British businessman is receiving \"harsh and unfair treatment\" from the Austrian legal authorities, his lawyer, Lord Goldsmith QC, has told the foreign secretary.</p> <p>The former attorney general wrote to William Hague last month about Julius Meinl, 53, a banker of Austrian descent. The businessman's lawyers have also made an application to the European court of human rights.</p> <p>Meinl was arrested at the state prosecutor's office in Vienna in April 2009, after attending voluntarily for interview. As a condition of bail, he was required to pay an extraordinary \u20ac100m into court - more than \u00a378m at current rates and believed to be a world record in any jurisdiction. </p> <p>Although the Austrian authorities have spent the past five years investigating alleged market manipulation by a property fund in which Meinl was not directly involved, he is the only person to have been arrested as a result of the investigation. Nobody has been charged and Meinl's bail money has not been returned.</p> <p>Complaining about the delay in dealing with the case, Goldsmith said his client's treatment was a breach of natural justice and caused \"the greatest concern\".</p> <p>The QC, head of European and Asian litigation at the international law firm Debevoise and Plimpton, urged Hague to raise Meinl's case with the Austrian authorities. He told the foreign secretary: \"There is a strong suspicion that the authorities have been reacting to public pressure from some quarters, which in turn is coloured by Mr Meinl's Jewish family background.\"</p> <p>Meinl is the fifth member of his family to bear the name of his great-great-grandfather, who founded an upmarket food retailing empire in 1862 on the idea of selling ready-roasted coffee beans. The family were forced to flee Austria in 1938 because Meinl's grandfather had married a woman of Jewish origin. </p> <p>After the war, the family were granted British nationality. Meinl's father served as a pilot in the RAF and his grandfather helped Britain to identify Nazi sympathisers who were still occupying positions of authority in Austria.</p> <p>Later, the family returned to Austria and re-established the family business as the equivalent of a cross between Fortnums and Waitrose. They also developed their customer savings division into Meinl Bank, one of Austria's most successful banking operations.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, the family sold their retailing business and moved into investment banking. A Jersey-registered property fund called Meinl European Land (MEL) was established, based on the company's property portfolio. The fund also bought shopping centres in the former Soviet bloc. Meinl Bank acted as MEL's sponsor and investment bank.</p> <p>In 2007, the property fund's value dropped heavily. Small investors, perhaps unfamiliar with the ways of the markets, were outraged to discover that a fund named after such a well-respected brand could go down in value as well as up. Meinl, who headed the bank's executive board, was held personally responsible by the Austrian public even though he was not directly involved in MEL. An Austrian business magazine called Format implicitly compared him to Hitler with a <a href=\"http://derstandard.at/1242315963031/Meinls-Kampf-Format-Cover-Meinl-tief-betroffen\">cover-story</a> headlined \"Meinls Kampf\".</p> <p>Attention centred on allegations that MEL had unlawfully bought back its own shares in order to prop up their price, shortly before the global financial crisis. Not so, Meinl told me when I <a href=\"http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/opinion/joshua-rozenberg/julius-meinl-s-predicament-should-disturb-common-law-jurisdictions\">interviewed him</a> in 2009. There was no market manipulation, he said: MEL had decided to repurchase its shares in order to sell a significant stake to a potential strategic partner.</p> <p>At that time, I had no way of testing Meinl's response. The Jersey financial services commission had appointed inspectors to investigate the allegation that MEL had provided financial assistance to itself to purchase its own shares - which would have been contrary to Jersey law - but their investigations were still continuing.</p> <p>It was not until December 2010 that the commission <a href=\"http://www.jerseyfsc.org/the_commission/general_information/press_releases/release263.asp\">concluded</a>, on the strength of the inspectors' findings, that the MEL buy-back had not been in breach of the island's laws. At the same time, though, the Jersey regulator announced an inquiry into whether MEL's directors had acted in a fit and proper manner.</p> <p>In February 2012, the Jersey commission declared its investigation closed. It <a href=\"http://www.jerseyfsc.org/the_commission/general_information/press_releases/release279.asp\">announced</a> that three former directors of MEL had given voluntary undertakings not to run other Jersey companies in future without the commission's prior consent, while stressing that this was not to be taken as any acceptance of wrongdoing by any of the three. Meinl was not one of them: he had never been a director of MEL or the separate Jersey company that acted as its manager.</p> <p>Meinl's lawyers say that the Jersey commission would not have accepted voluntary undertakings and closed its investigations if it had found any breach of the criminal law. The property fund, known as Atrium since a change of ownership in 2009, <a href=\"http://www.aere.com/Files/PressRelease/12%2008%2017%20Atrium%20H1%202012%20results%20highlights%20Final.pdf \">reported</a> \"excellent operational performance\" earlier this month.</p> <p>In his letter to the foreign secretary, Goldsmith accepts that there are limits to any British intervention in another country's criminal investigations. So Meinl's Austrian lawyers have also lodged an application at the human rights court in Strasbourg, arguing that the seizure of Meinl's correspondence with his lawyers and the excessive delay in investigating the allegations have denied him his right to a fair trial under article 6 of the convention.</p> <p>Perhaps more promisingly, Meinl's lawyers argue that setting his bail at \u20ac100m breached article 5 of the convention, the right to liberty. They accept that bail of \u20ac3 million was <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=002-822\">upheld</a> in the case of a ship's captain accused of responsibility for spilling oil into the Atlantic ocean. But that figure, they say, was on the very edge of admissibility. And this is 33 times as much.</p> <p>The lawyers also complain that the Austrian courts found that Meinl was a greater flight risk because of his British nationality. They argue that article 14 of the convention taken together with article 6 means that the right to a fair trial must be upheld without discrimination on grounds of national origin.</p> <p>If this application gets as far as the Strasbourg court, the Austrian government can be expected to argue that Meinl has not been deprived of his right to a fair trial, has not been treated any worse because he is British and was able to produce \u20ac100m within the day. </p> <p>What the Austrians may find harder to answer is why their investigation has taken so long and why were not willing to follow the findings of the Jersey authorities. Of course investigating and prosecuting fraud is difficult; and nobody knows that better than the former attorney general who, for six years, was ultimately responsible for all prosecutions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But still, he notes, \"the investigation drags on\". </p> <p>The Austrian legal authorities may yet be able to establish that they have not been influenced by anti-British or anti-Jewish sentiments. On this, though, the jury is still out.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney might think the most he has to deal with this week is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/republicans-disruption-isaac-new-orleans\" title=\"\">the approach of tropical storm Isaac</a> and his upcoming convention speech, but the Republican presidential candidate has also just been landed with a 130-year-old bill for $25,000 (\u00a316,000) from the author Judith Freeman.</p> <p>Freeman, author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/28/usa.biography\" title=\"\">a well-received biography of Raymond Chandler</a> and four novels, has traced her family history back to the 1870s, when her great-grandfather William Jordan Flake and Romney's great grandfather Miles P Romney \"were patriarchs of adjoining Mormon communities in the high, cold, hard country of northern Arizona, a region known as Apache County\". Although both men ran into trouble with local communities over their \"scandalous practice of polygamy\", Flake was a \"deeply respected man\", according to Freeman. Romney, on the other hand, was described by one newspaper editor as \"a mass of putrid pus and rotten goose pimples; a skunk, with the face of a baboon, the character of a louse, the breath of a buzzard and the record of a perjurer and common drunkard.\"</p> <p>US marshals were rounding up polygamists and arresting them at the time, and both men became targets and were eventually arrested. Flake posted bail of $1,000 for Romney, who had no money, <a href=\"http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=877&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=\" title=\"\">Freeman writes in the Los Angeles Review of Books</a>, and \"now we come to the matter I'd like to bring up with Mitt\".</p> <p>Miles P Romney, she says, then fled to Mexico, where Mitt's father George was born, while Flake served a six-month sentence for polygamy.</p> <p>\"The point is Miles P Romney never bothered to repay my great-grandfather Flake the thousand dollars he owed him for posting his bail. Since it's never too late to make a situation right, and since Mitt Romney seems to have sufficient funds now to cover his ancestor's old debt, I'd like to call upon him to do so,\" writes Freeman. Since the younger Romney's estimated fortune is some $230m, the bill should not be too much of a stretch.</p> <p>She has worked out that $1,000 from the 1880s would be worth about $25,000 today \u2013 she's willing to let the interest slide. \"Because William Jordan Flake has about 15,000 descendants living at the moment, I realize I'll have to divide up the money should Romney do the right thing and write out that check,\" she says. \"However, I want to assure Mitt that I'm more than happy to be the disburser of the funds and I guarantee that all the Flakes of the world will get their fair share the moment he does the right thing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Everything tactical in football is relative. There are few absolutes; everything has meaning and relevance only in relation to everything else. The question \"What's the best formation?\" is nonsensical because it depends on so many subsidiary questions: who are my players? How fit are they? How confident are they? How motivated are they? What are they used to doing? What result do we need from this game? Are we home or away? What is the weather like? What is the pitch like? Who are the opposition? How do they play? What shape do they play? How are their form and fitness? Even if a manager can accurately assess all of that, it may still be that after 10 minutes it becomes apparent that he needs to tweak something because of a player, whether on his side or the opponent's, suddenly having a great game or an appalling game.</p> <p>Yet trends develop. Certain formations become modish. Often, as with the long-standing reliance on 4-4-2 in Britain, it's to do with how football is coached at youth level. Sometimes it's because a successful team makes a particular way of playing popular \u2013 4-4-2, for instance, first came into vogue because of England's success at the 1966 World Cup. And sometimes formations disappear because, in the great game of scissors-paper-stone that football tactics often become, the fashionable way of playing is particularly effective against it.</p> <p>Three years ago, playing three at the back had all but disappeared. It had died away in the late 50s and 60s as the W-M was superseded by a back four, and re-emerged in the mid-80s, in slightly different forms, with Carlos Bilardo's Argentina, Sepp Piontek's Denmark, Franz Beckenbauer's West Germany and Ciro Blazevic's Dinamo Zagreb. The logic was simple: a libero flanked by two man-markers who picked up the opposing centre-forwards, wing-backs to drive the opposing wide men back and, against a 4-4-2, an extra man in midfield to help control possession (it was this approach, rather than the use of a back three <em>per se</em>, that Johan Cruyff described as being the \"death of football\"). The problem came as teams stopped playing two centre-forwards. Leave a libero and two markers against one striker and that means one of the markers is redundant (and, as a marker, probably not that adept at stepping into midfield), which in turns means a side will be a player short elsewhere on the pitch.</p> <p>Yet three at the back has started to make a comeback. It began in Italy, with Udinese and Napoli. At Barcelona, the first and most successful stage of Pep Guardiola's season-long charge backwards through the evolution of tactics was a back three. Then Wigan Athletic started doing it. Now Manchester City have joined in. In fact, in the top divisions of Europe's top five leagues over the weekend, 12 teams used the shape (eight in Italy, two in England, one in Spain, one in France and none in Germany). Three at the back is back.</p> <p>The difficulty of playing with three at the back against a lone striker has not gone away, of course. But what has emerged over the past few seasons is that there are specific circumstances in which the benefits of the shape outweigh that negative. Most obvious, for teams that sit deep and seek only to defend, having two spare men at the back (particularly if the marking is zonal rather than man-to-man) is actually a major advantage. Perhaps because of the extraordinary control of the ball achieved by Barcelona and Spain, it now seems more acceptable for games \u2013 in the minds of the team doing defending if nothing else \u2013 to take place only in one half, for one team to sit extremely deep and look to absorb pressure with only the occasional breakaway or set play. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/28/barcelona-internazionale-champions-league\" title=\"\">Internazionale's performance at the Camp Nou</a> in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final in 2010 opened a new vista of defensive possibility.</p> <p>That was certainly the logic Bordeaux used away to Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday, holding them to a 0-0 draw with an extremely defensive 3-3-3-1: Carlos Henrique, Ludovic San\u00e9 and Micha\u00ebl Ciani across the back with Henri Saivet and Ludovic Obraniak playing almost alongside the holder Landry Nguemo, so the shape was often a 5-3-1-1. That's three draws in a row for PSG and, as Philippe Auclair pointed out, it's not that teams have found a recipe for upsetting PSG, it's that everything that has been tried against them has unsettled them: Lorient counterattacked, Ajaccio sat back and sprang forward in controlled bursts of pressing; Bordeaux just stayed exceptionally deep.</p> <p>In Italy, the attraction seems cultural. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/feb/22/napoli-italy-back-three-resurgent\" title=\"\">I discussed the issue in some detail here</a> in February, but essentially there is a cultural urge to pack the centre, which is why two years ago the default formation was 4-3-1-2 with very little width. A back three offers a way of gaining attacking width (see, for example, Stephan Lichtsteiner getting forward to score <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/25/juventus-parma-serie-a\" title=\"\">Juventus's opener against Parma on Saturday</a>) while still being able to retain the number of bodies in the centre that Italian football seems to need to feel comfortable. It was also notable at the weekend that six of the eight sides using a back three were playing each other: Fiorentina against Udinese, Juventus against Parma and Palermo against Napoli (the other two were Bologna using a defensive back three away to Chievo and Siena playing a 3-5-2 against Torino's narrow 4-4-2). It may be that there was some matching of shapes going on, teams adopting a back three to play against a back three.</p> <p>The third group that may be attracted to a back three is those following the Bielsa protocol. Marcelo Bielsa's philosophy is radical \u2013 too radical, sadly, for most players, as Athletic Bilbao seem to be finding out (he may be the greatest theorist in football today, but the practicality of dealing with players who persist in being human undermines his coaching). For him defending is less about marking or reacting to opponents than about pressing to regain possession. He needs to be able to get players high up the field quickly, partly to attack an opponent in possession and partly to offer passing options when possession is regained. That is the logic Barcelona followed last season.</p> <p>Quite what advantage Manchester City see in using a back three is far from clear. They played with a back three against Chelsea <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/12/community-shield-chelsea-manchester-city\" title=\"\">in the Community Shield</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/26/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">then again against Liverpool on Sunday</a>. \"We went to it last year a little bit to close games off, but what the manager has tried to work on all pre-season is the ability to be able to go to a back three if we want to, and be more offensive than defensive with it,\" the assistant manager, David Platt, explained in a piece with the Manchester Evening News after the 3-2 win over Chelsea. \"The problem is that when you give the ball away you are more susceptible to a counterattack, and we did that for both goals against Chelsea.</p> <p>\"Robbie [Mancini] wanted to have a go at it this season, and we had discussions about it. Last year we flicked into a three at times, but we did it tactically, such as when we were 2-0 up with 20 minutes to go and someone puts a big striker on, to snuff out the space. Then it was done more from a defensive point of view in the last 15 or 20 minutes when teams were throwing everything, and the kitchen sink, at us. To add that other string to the bow, we had to have a good look at it from more of an offensive point of view, where we would have the wide centre-halves coming out and playing with the ball rather than staying narrow, and we are getting the wing-backs high.\"</p> <p>The attacking possibilities were apparent at times in the Community Shield, most notably when the left wing-back Aleksandar Kolarov got forward to cross for Samir Nasri to score City's third. Defensively, City were rather less comfortable. Against Liverpool, the problems were more pronounced (and, of course, although City ended up winning the Community Shield relatively comfortably, they were trailing when Branislav Ivanovic was sent off).</p> <p>The problem was the classic one of having three central defenders line up against a single central striker. With Raheem Sterling and Fabio Borini both threatening, neither City wing-back could get forward, and that meant Liverpool, with a midfield three plus two full-backs (although both were perhaps more cautious than they needed to be) able to push on in the absence of any City threat from wide, were able to dominate City's midfield two of Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Nigel de Jong plus Nasri dropping back. City in the end were extremely fortunate to take a point.</p> <p>So why did City use the back three? From what Platt said it would be to make City more like Bar\u00e7a, to drive the game higher up the pitch.</p> <p>But if that was the aim, then why start with a midfield four as functional as James Milner, De Jong, Tour\u00e9 and Kolarov? That's not a four geared to ball retention. But equally it seems inconceivable that City, facing a Liverpool side that had lost 3-0 to West Brom on the opening day, would have seen the need to go in with additional defensive cover \u2013 and the way they started the game certainly wasn't defensive.</p> <p>The lazy analysis of Mancini is to say that he's over-cautious because he's Italian, a weary stereotyping that's so generalised as to be meaningless. Where Mancini does seem to stay true to the traditions of the Italian game, though, is in his distrust of wingers (which you suspect Adam Johnson's fitful form only intensified). His sides, both at Inter and City, have always been narrow: playing a 3-4-1-2 allows him to have players overlap, as Kolarov did against Chelsea, while, in theory, retaining solidity. The problem comes against teams with genuine width such as that Liverpool demonstrated on Sunday.</p> <p>But there are wider problems. While it's always useful to have an extra tactical option, it's hard to see how it's possible for City, given personnel, to play a 3-4-3 or 3-4-1-2 without it becoming a broken team: a back three, two wing-backs, a holder (or two) and poor Yaya Tour\u00e9 slogging up and down to connect the back six to the front three. For one thing, that would seem to make it very difficult to fit Nasri and Silva into the same lineup, and for another that would seem to increase the reliance on Tour\u00e9, which it must be one of the aims of this season to reduce. There's nothing wrong, as such, with being a broken team, but it's a reactive way of playing: surely the richest team in football, a team that could be to this generation what Real Madrid was in the 50s, should be pro-active in approach, should be looking to produce a cohesive style of football that seeks to dominate games?</p> <p>Even if City's approach is puzzling, though, three at the back has re-established itself. Wigan Athletic's use of it is fascinating, particularly given how, this season, it has often morphed into a back four with Maynor Figueroa falling back in to a more orthodox left-back position at times. With Shaun Maloney dropping deep and Arouna Kon\u00e9 clearly operating behind Franco Di Santo, the system in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/25/southampton-wigan-athletic-premier-league\" title=\"\">Saturday's win against Southampton</a> was a base 3-4-2-1 that at times looked like a 3-4-3 and at times like a 4-4-1-1. For Roberto Mart\u00ednez, the back three seems a way of enhancing flexibility without sacrificing too much solidity: he has a back three and a front one and six players who adjust as required. In that, they're not dissimilar in approach to Napoli and, like Napoli, it's an approach that seems specific to that relatively small group of players. Wigan are unlikely to rotate too much this season.</p> <p>Every generation feels as though it is living at the end of history.</p> <p>It's very hard to imagine what will come next. How could there be anything new on football? How can it develop tactically? But evolution isn't necessarily forward. Perhaps there are no great tactical revolutions to come; probably our globalised, perpetually analysed world militates against them. But there is still plenty of life in old ideas, still plenty of ways to reinterpret that with which we are already familiar.</p>",

The judge said the driver could not have seen the activist from the cab of the bulldozer.</p> <p>Corrie could have saved herself by moving out of the zone of danger \"as any reasonable person would have done\", he said. The area was a combat zone, and the US government had warned its citizens not to go there.</p> <p>International activists were intent on obstructing the actions of the Israeli military and acting as human shields \"to protect terrorists\".</p> <p>Corrie was killed on 16 March 2003, crushed under an Israeli military bulldozer while trying to obstruct the demolition of a Palestinian home in Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border.</p> <p>The lawsuit, filed by Corrie's parents, Cindy and Craig, of Olympia, Washington state, accused the Israeli military of either unlawfully or intentionally killing Rachel or of gross negligence. The family had claimed a symbolic $1 (63p) in damages and legal expenses.</p> <p>The judge said no damages were liable, but the family's court costs would be waived.</p> <p>The family was \"deeply saddened and deeply troubled\" by the ruling, Cindy Corrie said at a press conference after the ruling. \"I believe this was a bad day, not only for our family, but for human rights, humanity, the rule of law and also for the country of Israel.\"</p> <p>The state had, she said, employed a \"well-heeled system\" to protect its soldiers and provide them with immunity. \"As a family, we've had to push for answers, accountability and justice.\"</p> <p>Rachel's sister, Sarah Corrie Simpson, said: \"I believe without doubt that my sister was seen as the driver approached her.\" She hoped that the driver would one day \"have the courage\" to tell the truth.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-395305294\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/28/120828CorrieVerdict-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/28/120828CorrieVerdict-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/28/120828CorrieVerdict_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120828CorrieVerdict/120828CorrieVerdict.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/28/120828CorrieVerdict_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>The US government believed the military investigation was flawed, she added. Last week, the US ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, told the Corrie family that Washington remained dissatisfied with the the inquiry. Hussein Abu Hussein, the family's lawyer, said: \"This verdict is yet another example of where impunity has prevailed over accountability and fairness. Rachel Corrie was killed while non-violently protesting home demolitions and injustice in Gaza, and today, this court has given its stamp of approval to flawed and illegal practices that failed to protect civilian life.</p> <p>\"We knew from the beginning that we had an uphill battle to get truthful answers and justice, but we are convinced that this verdict distorts the strong evidence presented in court, and contradicts fundamental principles of international law with regard to protection of human rights defenders. In denying justice in Rachel Corrie's killing, this verdict speaks to the systemic failure to hold the Israeli military accountable for continuing violations of basic human rights.\"</p> <p>The family would appeal against the ruling to Israel's supreme court, he added.</p> <p>Also speaking after the ruling, the state's attorney said the Israeli soldiers at the scene of Corrie's death did \"everything they could\" to prevent harm being caused to any person.</p> <p>In a statement, the Israeli justice ministry said: \"The death of Rachel Corrie is without a doubt a tragic accident. As the verdict states, the driver of the bulldozer and his commander had a very limited field of vision, such that they had no possibility of seeing Ms Corrie and thus are exonerated of any blame for negligence \u2026</p> <p>\"The security forces \u2026 were compelled to carry out 'levelling' work against explosive devices that posed a tangible danger to life and limb, and were not in any form posing a threat to Palestinian homes. The work was done while exercising maximum caution and prudence, and without the ability to foresee harming anyone.\"</p> <p>According to Bill Van Esveld of Human Rights Watch, the verdict \"sets a dangerous precedent in its claim that there was no liability for Corrie's death because the Israeli forces involved were conducting a 'combat operation' \u2026 The idea that there can be no fault for killing civilians in a combat operation flatly contradicts Israel's international legal obligations to spare civilians from harm during armed conflict, and to credibly investigate and punish violations by its forces.\"</p> <p>The judge's statement that the military inquiry into Corrie's death had been without fault was \"hard to reconcile with the facts\", he said. \"Military investigators repeatedly failed to take statements from witnesses, to follow up with the witness's lawyer, and to re-interview witnesses to clarify discrepancies.\"</p> <p>Huwaida Arraf, a co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement, the activist organisation for which Corrie volunteered, said after the ruling: \"The judge's ruling today is outrageous in so many ways, not least of which is the criticising of Rachel and the maligning of the International Solidarity Movement in an effort to place blame on all but those who killed Rachel and worked to cover it up. These are the same institutions that continue to injure and kill thousands of innocent Palestinians with no accountability. Not only does today's verdict mean that there is no justice for Rachel Corrie, but it also means that no human rights defender is safe from Israeli state violence.\"</p> <p>At the time of Corrie's death at the height of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, house demolitions were common, part of an increasing cycle of violence from both sides. Palestinian suicide bombers were causing death and destruction with terrifying frequency; the Israeli military was using its mighty force and weaponry to crush the uprising.</p> <p>The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said the houses it targeted with bulldozers and shells harboured militants or weapons, or were being used to conceal arms smuggling tunnels under the border. Human rights groups said the demolitions were collective punishment. Between 2000 and 2004, the Israeli military demolished around 1,700 homes in Rafah, leaving about 17,000 people homeless, according to the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem.</p> <p>Corrie was one of a group of around eight international activists acting as human shields against the demolitions. According to witness statements made at the time and evidence given in court, she clambered atop a pile of earth in the path of an advancing Caterpillar bulldozer. Fellow activists said she was clearly within the line of sight of the bulldozer driver.</p> <p>The day after Corrie's death, Israel's then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, promised US president George W Bush that Israel would conduct a \"thorough, credible and transparent\" investigation into the incident.</p> <p>Within a month, the IDF had completed an internal inquiry, led by its chief of staff. It concluded that its forces were not to blame, that the driver of the bulldozer had not seen the activist, that no charges would be brought and the case was closed.</p> <p>The Corries <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/27/rachel-corrie-death-israel-verdict\" title=\"\">launched their civil lawsuit against the state of Israel as an \"absolutely last resort\"</a>. The case opened at Haifa district court in March 2010.</p> <p>Among those giving evidence was the driver of the bulldozer, who testified anonymously from behind a screen for \"security reasons\". He repeatedly insisted that the first time he saw the activist was when she was already dying. He said: \"I didn't see her before the incident. I saw people pulling the body out from under the earth.\"</p> <p>The hearings ended in July last year.</p>",
  "<p>In the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks in Norway last summer, an overwhelming number of Norwegians assumed the country had been struck by radical Islamist terrorists. After all, that was what everyone \u2013 from experts on terror to the police intelligence service and the media \u2013 had told us to expect ever since September 11.</p> <p>History speaks for itself: in Norway, terrorist attacks have overwhelmingly come from the extreme right. But the Norwegian authorities have mainly been looking elsewhere. After the attacks of 22 July last year, many of my Muslim friends would tell me that they, too, had first assumed that these were attacks perpetrated by radical Islamists.</p> <p>On that day, a lot of Norwegian Muslims feared retaliatory attacks, to the extent that some kept themselves indoors. But despite this caution, a number of instances of <a href=\"http://www.antirasistisk-senter.no/om-trakassering-av-muslimer-og-innvandrere-etter-eksplosjonen-i-regjeringskvartalet-22-juli-2011.5074479.html\" title=\"\">harassment against Muslims on the streets</a> of Oslo have been documented on that evening.</p> <p>Among the 69 victims on the island of Ut\u00f8ya were a number of Norwegians of Muslim background. To them, as to so many other young Norwegian Muslims I meet as an anthropological researcher, being part of an increasingly multicultural Norwegian society means being an active, committed and engaged citizen. This assertive \"politics of presence\" stands in marked contrast to the politics of their parents' generation. The erstwhile Muslim labour migrants from countries such as Pakistan, Turkey and Morocco who came to Norway in the late 1960s and 1970s more often than not \"kept their heads down\", trying as best they could to ignore the racism many of them experienced, and remaining grateful for the opportunities that Norway had offered them and their offspring.</p> <p>Norwegian Muslims, who represent some 3% of the Norwegian population, experienced a period of grace after it became clear that the worst terrorist and mass murderer in the country's history was an extreme rightwing Islamophobe, rather than an Islamist radical Muslim.</p> <p>These were days in which many Norwegian Muslims, for the first time in their lives, would feel that Norwegians stood shoulder to shoulder with them, and acknowledged them as equals. White Norwegian strangers greeted or even embraced them on the streets. The prime minister and Oslo's mayor visited mosques. Across the country, government ministers attended the funerals of Muslim youth killed in the attack. At Nesodden, the funeral of an 18-year-old girl of Iraqi-Kurdish refugee background killed at Ut\u00f8ya, was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/30/world/europe/30norway.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">presided over by the local parish priest and an imam</a>. It served as a poignant reminder of the multicultural Norway that many of the social democratic youth activists at Ut\u00f8ya were committed to. In light of this, it mattered little that on various social media, the Muslim and Islam-bashing continued unabated.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/29/anders-behring-breivik-avoid-jail-insane\" title=\"\">first psychiatric report</a> on Anders Breivik, which was released in November 2011, displayed a mind-numbing ignorance about extreme rightwing ideology. With it came more sustained attempts to de-politicise the attacks. Many Norwegians conveniently managed to convince themselves that Breivik came from Planet Wacko rather than Oslo West, and that his ideas and actions had nothing whatsoever to do with Norwegian discourses on Islam and Muslims in the past decade.</p> <p>The mainstream political rhetoric concerning Islam in Norway has undoubtedly changed for the better in the past year. The number of ordinary citizens willing to contest Islamophobic discourse publicly has risen. But popular attitudes often remain stubbornly unchanged. A <a href=\"http://www.hlsenteret.no/publikasjoner/antisemittisme-i-norge\" title=\"\">2012 survey</a> indicates that Norwegians hold more negative attitudes towards Muslims than towards any other minority group, except the Roma. Such negative attitudes are more prevalent among Norwegians who profess adherence to rightwing political parties. It hardly seems coincidental that the one witness in the Breivik trial who received death threats on the day was Muslim. It is now little more than two weeks since a provincial leader of the Progress party in Norway <a href=\"http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/Frp-topp-Jeg-hater-muslimer-6967258.html\" title=\"\">declared on a party blog</a> that he \"hated Muslims\". The response was full and unconditional support from fellow provincial party colleagues, and only the mildest of rebukes from the party's national leadership.</p> <p>Following the 22/7 trial, it will no longer be possible for Norwegian extreme rightwing Islamophobes to deny that Breivik was in fact inspired and motivated by their ideals, fabrications and distortions. Nor will it be possible for the Progress party, Norway's third most popular party, to deny that its political rhetoric on Islam and Muslims in Norway was part of the ideological formation of Breivik, who was one of their dedicated party members for about 10 years until 2006. After a national trauma, the verdict presents us with the opportunity to finally face and confront the hatred in our midst with the honesty, seriousness and commitment it requires of us all.</p>",

Once Hall had bought the administration-threatened club he appointed the fiery Scot \u2013 widely known as \"The Rottweiler\" on Tyneside \u2013 as chief executive in January 1992.</p> <p>Working alongside the Hall family, Fletcher lured Keegan to the north-east, oversaw the modernisation of the club's commercial activities and helped develop St James' Park to its full potential. Along the way Newcastle rose from the foot of English football's second tier to within a fraction of winning the Premier League title.</p> <p>Sir John Hall on Tuesday paid tribute to his long-standing friend and colleague. \"He was instrumental to the success of Newcastle United,\" said the club's former owner. \"It's sad to think we have lost a truly great friend. What he did behind the scenes was invaluable. My condolences go to his wife Margaret and family.\"</p> <p>Freddy Shepherd, Newcastle's former chairman, also worked closely with Fletcher during the 1990s as the Scot followed up Keegan's recruitment with plans to turn St James' into the magnificent 52,000-capacity stadium it is today. \"Sir John Hall and myself were the money men but Freddie was the real driving force behind the Newcastle United revolution in the early 1990s,\" said Shepherd. \"He got Kevin Keegan in as manager to really put us on the map; it was totally his idea.</p> <p>\"At the time, Kevin was in Marbella playing golf with showbiz people like Sean Connery every day, but Freddie persuaded him off his own back to come back into football.</p> <p>\"Then he sat me and John Hall down and said: 'Listen, I've lined up Kevin Keegan. Ossie [Ardiles] could get us relegated so let's make the change.' We all went down to Hampshire to Keegan's house, flew Kevin back to Newcastle and did the deal. I'd never thought for one minute we'd get Keegan to come.</p> <p>\"Freddie came from a working-class background near the Greenock shipyards and he was determined beyond belief. His nickname at the club was The Rottweiler and he loved it. He wouldn't give up on anything. Newcastle's stadium as we know it now wouldn't have happened without Freddie.\"</p> <p>One of Fletcher's last acts as chief executive before leaving Newcastle to pursue other business interests in 2000 was to help appoint Sir Bobby Robson as Newcastle's manager in 1999. \"We all met Bobby in London,\" recalled Shepherd.</p> <p>\"Freddie was worried about how much it might cost but Bobby just waved him away and said: 'I'm not even going to talk about money. I'm coming. Just give me the best deal you can.' Freddie was shocked. He'd not experienced that from a manager before.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the benefits of being a penniless undergrad is that you're normally entitled to a student discount. Except when you visit the doctors, that is.</p> <p>It comes as a surprise to many, but free prescriptions are only available to full-time students aged 17 and under \u2013 so if you're at a university in England you can expect to pay<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/Prescriptioncosts.aspx\" title=\"\"> \u00a37.65 each time a doctor prescribes you some medicine</a>.</p> <p>When I asked the Department of Health why this is the case, they explained that other forms of support such as state-funded education and child benefit also end at 19. But I'm not sure this goes very far towards justifying the policy.</p> <p>It's important that prescription fees aren't just dismissed along with other student expenses like printing costs, books and stationery. Prescription fees are more serious \u2013 they could lead to students forgoing treatment a doctor believes is necessary.</p> <p>Current student Steve is one example. Rather than forking out for a prescription in England he hedged his bets and waited until he had returned home to Wales before visiting a pharmacy. Unfortunately his condition \"just got worse\", ultimately prolonging his treatment.</p> <p>Missing out on medical treatment might seem like an odd thing to do, but preliminary research suggests Steve isn't alone \u2013 70% of students say they are less likely to pick up prescriptions if there is a charge, regardless of their socio-demographic background.</p> <p>Gurinder Singh, author of the dissertation research, was surprised by the findings and \"didn't expect so many to be so willing not to get their medicines\".</p> <p>There is a low-income exception which students may be eligible for. But in practice applying to the scheme is cumbersome and confusing, and qualification appears to be a matter of pot-luck. Students report being unsuccessful one year, but successful the next.</p> <p>The form is intimidating and comprehensive. One of its long list of questions asks some students how many breakfasts, lunches and dinners they eat every week.</p> <p>Of course, some oppose free prescriptions for university students on the basis that it'll be too expensive. But a policy change might actually pay for itself. It's expensive to treat people whose conditions worsen through lack of treatment \u2013 the \u00a37.65 price tag of a prescription fee pales in comparison to the \u00a336 even just one extra GP consultation would cost. This was the logic behind Wales's decision to make prescriptions free.</p> <p>But more importantly, people foregoing treatment because they don't have enough money is contrary to everything the NHS stands for. Students already face increasing financial burdens while at university, access to medicine shouldn't be classed alongside other living costs.</p>",

In July, Jagger told the Evening Standard that the Stones had plans to perform live \"in the autumn\".</p> <p>On Monday, the band revealed that the aforementioned documentary, Charlie Is My Darling \u2013 Ireland 1965, will premiere at the New York film festival on 29 September.

  "<p>If you're about to book a holiday, think carefully about which day you plan to leave before you book the trip. According to research by Which?, Tuesday is the cheapest day of the week to fly from the UK. For example, flights with easyJet from Gatwick to Alicante on a Friday were, on average, 35% or \u00a328 more expensive than Tuesday flights. The consumer association, which looked at 1,174 September flights to three destinations in Europe with three airlines \u2013 British Airways, easyjet and Ryanair, found that Sunday was, on average, the most expensive day on which to return home. For example, return flights with easyJet from Gatwick to Alicante on Sundays were on average 45% (\u00a356) more expensive than on Thursdays. As well as cheaper days, there were cheaper times of the day to fly, though this varied across airlines. For example, BA's cheapest outbound flights were in the morning (before 7.30am), but with easyJet the mornings (between 5.45am-11am) were their most expensive time.</p> <p>Here are some more useful tips for keeping travel costs down. Please add your own money-saving advice to the <a href=\"#JUMP-TEXT\">comments below</a>:</p> <h2>Make the most of cashback websites</h2> <p>We all understand that if you book a holiday through a travel agent, the agent earns a percentage of the total cost as their commission. It's the same online: if you click a link on a website and make a purchase, the referring site gets to keep a certain amount of what you paid. Cashback sites such as <a href=\"http://www.quidco.com/\">Quidco.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.topcashback.co.uk/\">TopCashBack.co.uk</a> flip this on its head: they provide personalised referral links, collect the commission, then pay the money back to you.<br>Quidco is currently offering 11% rebates on hotels booked with Eurostar, 7% on hotels booked through Lastminute.com and 5% on hotels booked through Opodo \u2013 just for clicking an extra link.<br><strong>Example</strong> Click QuidCo link, book a <strong>\u00a3150</strong> Eurostar hotel room and receive <strong>\u00a316.50</strong> back</p> <h2>Avoid booking fees on UK train travel</h2> <p>All UK railway ticket websites use the same database so offer the same range of tickets and prices as their competitors. Despite a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/may/20/asa-trainline-ad>snazzy marketing campaign that claimed to offer substantial savings&lt;/a>, market leader &lt;a href=\" http: www.thetrainline.com\">thetrainline.com</a> is no cheaper than its rivals \u2013 but unlike other sites they charge a \u00a31 booking fee per transaction and an additional \u00a33.50 if you use a credit card. Instead book your tickets through the train operators' own websites. South-West Trains (<a href=\"http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/\">southwesttrains.co.uk</a>) doesn't charge fees and even offers a <a href=\"http://quidco.com/south-west-trains\">2.6% rebate</a> on all tickets nationwide if you book through a cashback website.<br><strong>Example </strong>York-Edinburgh off-peak return, booked through thetrainline.com with a credit card, <strong>\u00a385.50</strong>. Same ticket booked through Quidco and South-West Trains, <strong>\u00a378.90</strong></p> <h2>Swap flights for the ferry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395297748\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/27/1346070929217/Dublin-Temple-Bar-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dublin Temple Bar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enjoy a trip to Dublin for less with a train-ferry ticket. Photograph: Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Want to escape at short notice but find flights too expensive? <a href=\"http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/SailRail/\" title=\"\">SailRail.co.uk</a> is a little-promoted ticket left over from the days of British Rail. It enables you to travel from any UK railway station to Dublin for a flat rate of \u00a343 each way, with all rail and ferry connections included. Simply turn up at your local station, buy the ticket and take the next train to Holyhead. You have an unlimited luggage allowance, there's no check-in and a beautiful train journey is included for free. A similar service, the Dutch Flyer (<a href=\"http://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferry/rail-and-sail/holland/\" title=\"\">stenaline.co.uk</a>), allows travel from any London station to any station in the Netherlands for \u00a339 each way.<br><strong>Example</strong> Depart London Euston at 7.10am and arrive in central Dublin before 2pm, <strong>\u00a343</strong> booked on the day. Equivalent flights and airport transfers, <strong>over \u00a3130</strong></p> <h2>Make the most of local deal sites</h2> <p>We're used to seeking out discount coupon deals at home but few people check what's on offer abroad. In the run up to your holiday keep an eye the foreign versions of <a href=\"http://www.groupon.co.uk\">Groupon</a> and other coupon sites to grab a bargain. You could discover where the locals eat, save 50% on meals and gain discount access to popular attractions.<br><strong>Example</strong> <a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/new-york\" title=\"\">Groupon New York</a> is flooded with offers for substantial discounts in local restaurants, such as a <strong>$40</strong> meal for <strong>$20</strong> at Lantern Thai in the East Village. The <a href=\"http://www.groupon.fr/\" title=\"\">French version of the site</a> is offering a helicopter flight over Paris for two for <strong>\u20ac189</strong> instead of <strong>\u20ac480</strong></p> <h2>Split-ticket your train journey</h2> <p>Even if you haven't booked a UK train ticket in advance you can make substantial savings by split-ticketing. This exploits the fact that two tickets split at an intermediary station can be cheaper than buying one ticket all the way to your destination. This is perfectly legal as long as the train stops at the intermediary station. Train ticketing websites such as <a href=\"http://www.splityourticket.co.uk/\" title=\"\">splityourticket.co.uk</a> help spot combinations that may work.<br><strong>Example</strong> An off-peak day return from Manchester &gt; Bristol is <strong>\u00a375</strong>. But a series of day returns from Manchester-Stafford (\u00a320), Stafford-Wolverhampton (\u00a35.80), Wolverhampton-Cheltenham (\u00a322.30) and Cheltenham-Bristol (\u00a38.20) are valid on exactly the same trains but cost only <strong>\u00a356.30</strong></p> <h2>Split-ticket your flight</h2> <p>Splitting tickets also works with no-frills airlines. Airlines such as <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/en\">Ryanair</a> often sell off large numbers of cheap flights to unpopular destinations at a flat rate of \u00a310 or under. Rather than take a direct flight. book two flights via an unpopular destination, leave an hour to transfer and reap the rewards. But there is a risk: if one flight is substantially delayed and you miss your onward journey, you're on your own. Watch the website for flight sell-offs.</p> <h2>Use a card that doesn't charge abroad</h2> <p>There's no point in scrimping on your travel costs only to run up charges on exchange rates and card purchases. Most high street banks add fees to transactions made overseas and give a poor exchange rate. Consider getting a credit card exclusively for use abroad \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/travel/cheap-travel-money\" title=\"\">Money Saving Expert</a> recommends the Halifax Clarity card, which gives you the real exchange rate.<br><strong>Example</strong> A purchase in a foreign shop on a standard Lloyds TSB debit card carries a \u00a31 transaction charge and a 2.99% foreign exchange fee. The Clarity card charges the standard Mastercard exchange rate and no extra fees</p> <h2>Stay in someone's house</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395297749\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/27/1346071060741/Berlin-airbnb-008.jpg\" alt=\"Berlin airbnb\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A double room in Berlin for under \u00a330</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sites such as as the popular <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Airbnb.co.uk</a> allow strangers to market a spare room or apartment for rent and provide you with the security of an eBay-style feedback system. Prices are often lower than in hotels, the rooms in better condition and the welcome friendlier.<br><strong>Example</strong> A double room in a central Berlin apartment for <strong>\u00a329</strong> a night (<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/172374\" title=\"\">airbnb.com/rooms/172374</a>). The owner can recommend places to go and even offers a massage at the end of a long day's sightseeing</p> <h2>Buy a local SIM card for internet access</h2> <p>If you're going away for several weeks, especially outside the EU, avoid internet cafe charges and mobile data roaming fees by buying a local pay-as-you-go SIM card. Fierce competition among mobile operators means data deals can be even cheaper than in the UK.<br><strong>Example</strong> 59,000 Colombian pesos (<strong>\u00a320</strong>) buys a SIM card from the Tigo network that includes 3GB of mobile internet \u2013 more than enough to check your emails, research travel plans and send a photo back home, see <a href=\"http://prepaiddatasims.com/prepaid-phone-plans-in-colombia/\" title=\"\">prepaiddatasims.com/prepaid-phone-plans-in-colombia</a> for more details</p> <h2>Compare, compare, compare</h2> <p>Before booking your holiday ensure you can't save money elsewhere by using a \"scraper\" website to compare prices from hundreds of airlines and travel agents. <a href=\"http://www.momondo.com/\" title=\"\">Momondo.com</a> provides a brilliantly designed calendar summary of flight prices that allows you to spot and avoid peak periods. And <a href=\"http://www.kayak.co.uk\">Kayak.co.uk</a> comes with a fantastic set of apps for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry.<br><strong>Example</strong> Search for a one-way flight from London to Istanbul in February on Momondo and at a glance you can see that prices vary between <strong>\u00a340</strong> and <strong>\u00a3107</strong></p> <p><a name=\"JUMP-TEXT\"> </a></p>",
  "<p>When Kirklees council was looking to boost its community investment programme, it hit upon a new way of assessing projects in receipt of grant funding. Rather than just measuring what went into the services, it decided to try to weigh up what came out.</p> <p>For drug addiction and mental health services, this meant that as well as the cost of buildings and staff, officers also tried to take into account the benefits to both the individuals using the services and their families. Five years on, the West Yorkshire authority is building on this work to help meet a new obligation placed on councils: to consider how their spending affects the wellbeing of the communities they serve.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/networking-discussions/blogs/18452/12/07/02/what-social-value-act\" title=\"\">Social Value Act</a>, which became law in March and comes into force in January, introduces a statutory requirement for local authorities, alongside other public bodies, to consider economic, social and environmental wellbeing in public services procurement.</p> <p>The obligation means that, as well as cost and quality of service, a whole range of factors can be taken into account when drawing up a contract, from the number of apprentices employed in waste collection to how frequently day centre users engage with mental health services.</p> <p>At Kirklees, the community investment programme has been retrospectively recognised as the authority's first foray into social value. \"At the time it felt like what we were doing was quite new and different,\" says Linda Wilkinson, head of market development and innovation. For its initial assessments, Kirklees developed a series of indicators for service users, including self-esteem, physical health and developing new skills. But Wilkinson recognises there are potential pitfalls in this approach, which go to the heart of the social value agenda.</p> <p>\"One of the big things is how you measure social value,\" she explains. \"You look at one metric versus another, and it is quite difficult to decide on the best approach. You have got to make it relatively simple, but it gets so complex that the methodology almost takes over.\"</p> <p>While some elements of social value can be easily measured \u2013 such as the percentage of staff apprentices employed on a project \u2013 others are not so straightforward, and this may prove a powerful disincentive to applying the principles of the act, according to Julia Slay, senior researcher at the New Economic Forum thintank.</p> <p>And while many local authorities are interested in this area, the financial climate and headcount reductions mean progress might be patchy, Slay says. \"The context has really changed because people don't have the time or the strategic interest to think about it.\"</p> <p>Slay argues that the act does not constitute a major shift in thinking, but simply reinforces an existing duty on local authorities to promote wellbeing. Its real implications will only become clear once the legislation has been tested in the courts.</p> <p>The Local Government Association is planning to issue guidance on implementing the act later this year, and is planning to host a national event around social value in October. In the meantime councils will set the likely cost of assessing social value against the risk of losing a legal challenge, according to Tim Goodspeed, training manager at the Social Return on Investment Network.</p> <p>Yet, with many service providers, authorities seeking to embed social value may find themselves pushing at an open door. Waste management firm Veolia, which has contracts with 139 councils, already seeks to incorporate social value principles, according to executive director Robert Hunt.</p> <p>As well as a focus on apprentices, the company also provides opportunities for people not in education, employment or training (Neets) and prisoners, he says. \"It is a question of talking to your local authority clients and listening to what is important to them,\" he adds.</p> <p>Making sure your suppliers know what your values are will be the key to meeting the requirements of the act, says Laura Langstaff, deputy head of procurement at East Sussex council. The authority has already identified a number of forthcoming tenders where social value can be applied, from grounds maintenance to providing school meals. But while the approach to monitoring social value will vary according to the service, the broad principles should remain the same.</p> <p>\"There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach and it is important to invest the time so that your suppliers understand what is important to you as an organisation,\" she says. \"There is no easy answer to how to assess social value: an approach for a major construction contract is going to be very different to one for adult social care.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and the </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>latest job vacancies</strong></a></p>",

We had to weigh up whether remaining a critical friend inside or campaigning outside is better for our members and the wider community.</p> <p>Earlier this year we claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/feb/23/government-not-delivering-mental-health\" title=\"\">that many government policies were not only failing to advance the strategy</a> but were actually undermining its aims. For example, the Department for Education's decision to remove wellbeing and community cohesion from the school inspection regime is in direct contradiction to the strategy's call for more early intervention and education. Freed from these requirements, many schools are shutting counselling services and nine out of 10 academies are serving their pupils junk food, damaging mental and physical health with expensive consequences.</p> <p>While we have criticised when appropriate, NSUN has also sought to work constructively with government in efforts to improve the situation where we find allies. Standing up to government policies we believe damage mental health while seeking to increase the positive influence of service users in government is a difficult line to tread.</p> <p>In the end we decided that the Department of Health had given us a fair say, had incorporated many amendments suggested by us and our members \u2013 for example, we managed to change much of the document's tone so that it no longer subjectively branded all mental health conditions an 'illness' and disempowered service users as 'victims' and 'sufferers' suggesting they have no control over their lives \u2013 and that we would be doing more harm than good to distance ourselves.</p> <p>In practical terms, our suggestions to emphasise the value of involving service users in the commissioning of their own services to an agreed standard, and enabling self-help, peer support, personalised budgets, training and education have all been taken up and will form part of the implementation instructions to medical and social care professionals, local authorities, commissioners, providers and employers, among others.</p> <p>In essence we have been able to stress that mental health service users recover best when they are given control over their own lives and treated as having assets and potential rather than as problems to be medicated and managed.</p> <p>Apart from it being morally right to give people control over their own lives, we found this approach can produce significant savings as people gain in confidence, skills and recovery when they are given control and resources.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://lambethcollaborative.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Lambeth Living Well Collaborative</a>, for example, has helped more than 200 psychiatric inpatients get back into the community by helping them fulfil their ambitions and in Hackney, NSUN has seen service users grow in confidence while building a commissioning advisory group to shape services to their needs.</p> <p>While we are very glad to have had the opportunity to promote this approach, it is not to say we agree with everything in the framework and much depends on whether it is implemented, not least by other government departments including the Department for Work and Pensions, whose benefit changes are badly hurting many people with mental health conditions.</p> <p>For this framework to make a real positive difference, more power must be shifted to service users so they have control over their lives and recoveries through meaningful co-production of services, proper personal budgets and real involvement in decision making.</p> <p>NSUN will monitor the implementation, partly through our new Mental HealthWatch scheme, whereby service users get involved in their local scrutiny groups and share intelligence and good practice. If we find that the health secretary's oft-quoted mantra <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm78/7881/7881.pdf\" title=\"\">\"nothing about me without me\"</a> is indeed just empty rhetoric, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support and campaign vigorously against those who have wasted a valuable chance for progress.</p> <p><em>Edward Davie is a Labour councillor and chairs Lambeth council's health and adult social services scrutiny committee </em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-healthcare-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The death of the pro-Palestinian activist Rachel Corrie was not caused by the negligence of the Israeli state or army, a judge has ruled, dismissing a civil lawsuit brought by the family.</p> <p>Corrie's death was an accident for which the state of Israel was not responsible, said the judge at Haifa district court.</p> <p>There had been no fault in the internal Israeli military investigation clearing the driver of the bulldozer that crushed Corrie to death in March 2003 of any blame. The judge said the driver had not seen the young American activist.</p> <p>Corrie could have saved herself by moving out of the zone of danger as any reasonable person would have done, said Judge Oded Gershon. He ruled that no compensation would be paid and the family would not have to pay costs of the case.</p> <p>After the ruling was read out by the judge, the family's lawyer, Hussein Abu Hussein, said: \"We knew from the beginning that we had an uphill battle to get truthful answers and justice. But we are concerned that this verdict denies the strong evidence and contradicts the principles of international law.\"</p> <p>Also speaking after the ruling, the state's attorney said the Israeli soldiers at the scene of Corrie's death did \"everything they could\" to prevent harm being caused to any person.</p> <p>The lawsuit, filed by Corrie's parents, Cindy and Craig, of Olympia, Washington state, accused the Israeli military of either unlawfully or intentionally killing Rachel or of gross negligence.</p> <p>Their daughter was killed on 16 March 2003, crushed under an Israeli military bulldozer while trying to obstruct the demolition of a Palestinian home in Rafah on to the Gaza-Egypt border.</p> <p>At the time \u2013 the height of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising \u2013 house demolitions were common, part of an increasing cycle of violence from both sides. Palestinian suicide bombers were causing death and destruction with terrifying frequency; the Israeli military was using its mighty force and weaponry to crush the uprising.</p> <p>The Israeli Defence Forces said the houses it targeted with bulldozers and shells were harbouring militants or weapons or being used to conceal arms-smuggling tunnels under the border. Human rights groups said the demolitions were collective punishment. From 2000-04 the Israeli military demolished around 1,700 homes in Rafah, leaving about 17,000 people homeless, according to the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem.</p> <p>Corrie was one of a group of around eight international activists acting as human shields against the demolitions. According to witness statements made at the time and evidence given in court, she clambered on top of a mound of earth in the path of an advancing Caterpillar bulldozer.</p> <p>\"She was standing on top of a pile of earth,\" fellow activist and eyewitness Richard Purssell, from Brighton, said at the time. \"The driver cannot have failed to see her. As the blade pushed the pile, the earth rose up. Rachel slid down the pile. It looks as if her foot got caught. The driver didn't slow down; he just ran over her. Then he reversed the bulldozer back over her again.\"</p> <p>Tom Dale, an 18-year-old from Lichfield in Staffordshire, said: \"The bulldozer went towards her very slowly, she was fully in clear view, straight in front of them. Unfortunately she couldn't keep her grip there and she started to slip down. You could see she was in serious trouble, there was panic in her face as she was turning around. All the activists there were screaming, running towards the bulldozer, trying to get them to stop. But they just kept on going.\"</p> <p>The day after Corrie's death, Israel's then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, promised US president George W Bush that Israel would conduct a \"thorough, credible and transparent\" investigation into the incident.</p> <p>Within a month the IDF had completed an internal inquiry led by its chief of staff. It concluded that its forces were not to blame, that the driver of the bulldozer had not seen the activist, that no charges would be brought and the case was closed.</p> <p>\"Rachel Corrie was not run over by an engineering vehicle but rather was struck by a hard object, most probably a slab of concrete which was moved or slid down while the mound of earth which she was standing behind was moved,\" it said. Corrie and other ISM activists were accused by the investigators of \"illegal, irresponsible and dangerous\" behaviour. </p> <p>The Corries launched their civil lawsuit against the state of Israel as an \"absolutely last resort\". The case opened at Haifa district court in March 2010.</p> <p>Among those giving evidence was the driver of the bulldozer, who testified anonymously from behind a screen for \"security reasons\". He repeatedly insisted that the first time he saw the activist was when she was already dying: \"I didn't see her before the incident. I saw people pulling the body out from under the earth.\"</p> <p>The hearings ended in July last year.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wellington, August 27.</strong></p> <p>Three experts to-day told a Wellington court trying Juliet Marion Hulme (15) and Pauline Yvonne Parker (16) for the murder of Pauline's mother that both girls were sane. Yesterday two defence witnesses contended that they were and always would be insane. </p> <p>The first witness to-day, Dr Kenneth Stallworthy, superintendent of Auckland Mental Hospital, told the Court that Pauline had said: \"We knew we were doing wrong. We knew that we would be punished if we were caught and we did our best not to be caught. I would have been an absolute moron not to know that murder was against the law.\"</p> <p>Dr Stallworthy said that his conclusion was that neither girl had any disease of the mind. After quoting Pauline, he said that Juliet had told him: \"I knew it was wrong to murder, and I knew at the time that I was murdering somebody.\"</p> <p>The prosecutor: Do you know of any paranoiacs who went through the various stages the girls did - lying, cheating, blackmailing, and thieving?</p> <p>Dr Stallworthy: No. I have seen sane murderers show such a callousness as has been commented on in this case. In my experience, liking for games of bloodshed and violence are exceedingly common among adolescents. The type of literature in such demand to-day by adults, and embodying just these things, shows this, I think.</p> <p>Is there any connection between homosexuality and paranoia? - There is, in my opinion, no relation between active homosexuality and paranoia. I do not know of any practising homosexual who is a paranoiac, I do not consider homosexuality, which is by no means uncommon, as any indication of insanity.</p> <p>Are these girls homosexual? - I think there is no doubt that the girls have been engaged in some form of physical homosexuality. It is usual for adolescents to outgrow that stage. There is, I think, clear evidence that Parker was sufficiently interested to let members of the opposite sex make love to her, one way or another.</p> <p>Dr Stallworthy's evidence was supported by the two other medical witnesses, Mr D. D. Hunter, superintendent of Sunnyside Mental Hospital, and Mr J. E. Saville, a Sunnyside medical officer. Mr Saville told the court that he would not certify either girl insane, emphasising that he did not know of any crime committed by two insane people in combination.</p> <p>Pauline and Juliet are accused of murdering Mrs Parker by hitting her with a brick enclosed in a stocking while they were walking through a Christchurch park. The evidence was ended to-day, and the court adjourned until to-morrow, the sixth day of the trial, when counsels' final addresses and the judge's summing-up will be heard.</p> <p>[Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker were <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346069671129/Hulme-and-Parker-found-gu-001.jpg\">found guilty of the murder</a> of Pauline's mother, Honora Rieper, on 28 August 1954.

  "<h2><strong>Day four: 2 September</strong></h2> <p>Britain's dominance in the velodrome looks set to continue as the nation's Paracycling elite take to the track. Today sees the men's team sprint finals (qualifications 11:35am, finals 3:25pm) with Darren Kenny, Rik Waddon and Jon-Allan Butterworth going for gold. GB held off China to win in 2008, and they'll be doing all they can for a repeat performance without the experience of Cundy. Also in action is the world No1 table tennis ace, Will Bayley, in the Class 7 competition (5.15pm). Elsewhere, the unbeaten rowing machine Tom Aggar should be in the single sculls final over at Eton Dorney, while \"Discus\" Dan Greaves takes to the field in the Olympic Stadium (11.40am).</p> <h2>Archery</h2> <p>10:00 Women's Individual Recurve -
