  "<p>Steven Gerrard will urge Luis Su\u00e1rez to set the right tone for a tense encounter between Liverpool and Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday by shaking Patrice Evra's hand and not exacerbating the feud that erupted between the pair last season.</p> <p>Gerrard, in an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, says he wants Su\u00e1rez and Evra to set the right example on a day when both sets of supporters are being urged to put an end to songs about the Hillsborough and Munich tragedies.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez was banned for eight games last season after a Football Association independent commission ruled he had racially abused Evra and the Liverpool player was forced to issue a public apology after the return match at Old Trafford when he snubbed his opponent in the lineups.</p> <p>\"I think those two players could be the key,\" Gerrard says. \"The handshake is at the beginning of the match and they've got a responsibility to start the day off on a good note. I will speak to Su\u00e1rez and my advice will be to shake hands and move on. Su\u00e1rez will make his own decision. Of course he will. But I'd like to think he would want to move on himself.\"</p> <p>Gerrard's cousin, Jon-Paul Gilhooley, was the youngest of the 96 people killed at Hillsborough, aged 10, and the player reveals in an emotional interview that he is still so scarred by the memories that he has found it \"too difficult\" to read, in full, the report published by the Hillsborough Independent Panel.</p> <p>Twenty-three years after the disaster, the Liverpool captain wants the people behind the cover-up to be punished. \"I think everyone \u2013 I'm sure you are the same \u2013 does. If there are people out there who should be punished and deserve to be punished, of course. It's not in my control. But I hope so, yes.\"</p> <p>The game has been preceded by appeals from both clubs for the two sets of supporters to stop the taunts about the disasters that have affected them so deeply, Hillsborough and the 1958 Munich air crash which claimed the lives of eight United players and three club officials. \"I'm sure the Liverpool and Manchester United fans know what the right thing&#xa0;to do is,\" Gerrard says. \"There's a big game of football and a lot at stake. But this is more important than football, what we're talking about. We all love football because of these rivalries. That can't stop. But there's a line.\"</p> <p>On Friday it emerged that Sir Alex Ferguson would be writing to United fans attending the match, calling for them to abandon their \"hatred\" of Liverpool and to \"pay tribute to their campaign for justice\". \"I know I can count on you to stand with us in the best traditions of the best fans in the game,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers also spoke of the significance of the match: \"It is a great opportunity globally for us to commemorate what has happened. If we can come out on top across the board, not only Liverpool but football will be the winner and that is what we are all looking for.\"</p>",
  "<p>Watching the events of the last 10 days makes it hard to have much confidence in the sanity of the human race. After Friday prayers in Pakistan \u2013 the day of Love for the Prophet in which an estimated 19 people died and 200 were injured \u2013 protesters burned down two cinemas to express their outrage about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/sep/17/innocence-of-muslims-demonstration-film\" title=\"\"><em>Innocence of Muslims</em></a>, a work that was made available only on YouTube, not in cinemas. It's as logical as smashing your computer because you object to what's being shown at the local Odeon.</p> <p>But things could have been much worse. Even though so many lives have been lost, there was another side of the story that escaped us \u2013 the fact that a very tiny proportion of Muslims actually went on the streets. In France, Muslims showed restraint after the publication of cartoons by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/paris-magazine-muhammad-cartoons-french\" title=\"\"><em>Charlie Hebdo</em></a>. In Egypt and Tunisia, the governments intervened to stop the riots, while in Yemen and Pakistan, the military prevented rioters reaching western embassies. More hopeful was the action by cheering crowds that swept through Benghazi, in eastern Libya, clearing the strongholds of Ansar al-sharia, the militant group thought responsible for the death of US diplomat Chris Stevens a week ago.</p> <p>Reason did eventually prevail. The American administration got the picture quickly. Obama and Clinton moved to condemn the film, even buying advertising time on Pakistani TV, and the vast majority of Muslims saw <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> for what it was and stayed at home.</p> <p><a href=\"http://gawker.com/\" title=\"\">The Gawker website</a> had it about right in lampooning the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=1204&amp;bih=778&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=K5znsG4YEz-wCM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://now.msn.com/muslimrage-newsweek-hashtag-taken-over-by-angry-twitter-users&amp;docid=32EsOXcAZpPjyM&amp;imgurl=http://blu.stb.s-msn.com/i/36/79449624F2794C497B57F92749D6.jpg&amp;w=520&amp;h=390&amp;ei=AcldUMW0O8bPhAfMsYDYBA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=116&amp;vpy=297&amp;dur=2433&amp;hovh=194&amp;hovw=259&amp;tx=135&amp;ty=154&amp;sig=118040935302464543552&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=128&amp;tbnw=171&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=24&amp;ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:97\" title=\"\">cover of <em>Newsweek</em>, which shows two angry Muslim men</a> under the headline: \"Muslim Rage\". The website ran a series of pictures of smiling Muslim kids on a garden swing, canoodling in the park, doing handstands, swimming. My favourite is of a man slouching in a chair outside his store with a newspaper. The caption reads: \"This Egyptian guy is filled to the brim with Muslim Rage\".</p> <p>On YouTube, you will find a man named Syed Mahmood, who makes an eminently sensible assessment. <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> was \"a load of crap that was made to ignite rage \u2013 being violent makes a success of the film\". This is the voice I recognise from covering the Arab Spring \u2013 calm and rational, but no less devout for its modernity. I encountered it in Egypt and Tunisia, where young people expressed their ambition to combine the freedoms and prosperity of the west with respect for Islam and local traditions. It's a voice you haven't heard much in the media because idiots dancing round a fire makes news, but it was the force behind the Arab uprisings and, despite the repression and manipulations of an older generation, it is still there.</p> <p>The film and the cartoons are plainly not some faux pas that will easily be forgotten. People are genuinely offended. The grievance will be nurtured and there are forces in Islam that will continue to whip up anger and to insist that the free expression of the west and the lack of government control on the internet and media was responsible for the film\u2026 in fact, tantamount to a blessing. That is where my sympathy ends, because it as rational as blaming me for the sentiments expressed in the graffiti at the end of my street.</p> <p>We have an obligation to use free speech responsibly and there are laws in Europe and the US against religious and racial incitement, which the film and cartoons may have broken. However, as Muslim spokesmen (they are nearly always men) demand greater restrictions on free speech, I find myself thinking that if every major Arab newspaper did not habitually publish antisemitic cartoons, which in their levels of racist hatred would not be out of place in the pages of Julius Streicher's tabloid <em>Der St\u00fcrmer</em>, I'd be more inclined to listen to their complaints.</p> <p>To the people who rioted and killed last week, there is no equivalence between an insult to religion and an insult to race \u2013 the first unquestionably trumps the second. But like most people in the west, I believe that racism is on a par with religious intolerance and causes just as much suffering. Newspapers across the Middle East allow this outpouring of racial hatred, without the slightest understanding that it is profoundly offensive to demonise and dehumanise Jews by portraying them as Nazis, cannibals, snakes, pigs and cockroaches.</p> <p>It's much harder to admit to the faults in your own society than reach for the status of aggrieved party \u2013 and if there is one criticism of Muslim countries it is this reflexive victimhood that entirely overlooks the routine torture practised in so many Muslims states: the failure to accord women equal rights and a proper voice in the running of society; the absence of free expression, association and assembly; the lack of civil society and the persecution of religious minorities.</p> <p>Religious intolerance is everywhere. <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2363/religious-restrictions-rising-worldwide-social-hostilities-religious-freedom\" title=\"\">A report by the Pew Research Centre shows a rising tide of religious restriction</a>. The number of countries with high restrictions on religious belief rose from 31% in 2009 to 37% in 2010.</p> <p>Muslims suffer as much as the followers of other faiths \u2013 they have been forbidden to build mosque minarets in Switzerland, for instance \u2013 but the growth in the persecution of Christians in Muslim societies is striking. In Pakistan, Christians face punishment and discrimination; in Indonesia, churches have been closed. In Egypt, the Copts are openly discriminated against in the courts. Across Africa, Christians are being attacked in their churches; in Kuwait, the \"villa-churches\" used by foreigners are being forcibly shut; in Iraq, Christians are targeted by kidnappers and bombers; in Iran, 300 Christians have been arrested since 2010.</p> <p>And let's not forget that minority sects in Muslim societies that suffer as well. The point is that while Muslim spokesmen demand respect for their faith they are not often prepared to give it to others, and in the west this inconsistency is a significant obstacle to a better understanding of the offence taken from the film and cartoons.</p> <p>Free speech is at the heart of this issue, but western governments should not be bamboozled into imposing restrictions that exceed present laws. On the contrary, we should proclaim its value, because the kind of free debate the young people in the Arab Spring yearned for will bring about transformation in states where torture, discrimination against women and religious minorities and the failure to build modern civil societies all go unchallenged.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012. The original referred to the ban on building mosques in Switzerland. That should have been mosque minarets, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>A follow-up to <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141043531\" title=\"The Big Short\"><em>The Big Short</em></a>, in which Michael Lewis examined the men who made fortunes out of subprime mortgages, <em>Boomerang</em> addresses the scarier phase of the financial meltdown: the debt crisis in Europe and America.</p> <p>It is written as a travelogue-cum-investigative-report, with Lewis jetting off to Iceland, Greece and Ireland before stopping in Germany \u2013 the pusher supplying the addicts \u2013 and then finishing back home in the US.</p> <p>Having risen to prominence as an acerbic commentator on the wide boys, wackos and wizards of high finance, Lewis finds plenty of targets for his scathing wit on this tour. While risking offence to entire nations, the narrative is at times caustically funny. Icelanders \"have a feral streak in them, like a horse that's just pretending to be broken\". Germans long \"to be near the shit, but not in it\".</p> <p>Elsewhere, there is a dark edge to the humour. The preface describes the author's unsettling encounter with Kyle Bass, a billionaire financier who hoards precious metals in anticipation of impending apocalypse and spends weekends shooting sniper rifles on his Texan ranch. The intractability of the debt crisis, with Europe's sickliest economies in a seeming death spiral, makes later passages in <em>Boomerang</em> both urgent and chilling.</p> <p>Lewis has a talent for distilling complex ideas and arguments into pithy comment. Ireland's property bust, he writes, was caused by Irishmen using foreign money to buy Ireland from one another. While the Greeks want no part of the debts they all accrued, the Irish seem willing to repay money borrowed by a few banks \"without so much as a small moan\".</p> <p>In the final chapter, Lewis visits the California city of Vallejo, bankrupted by the cost of public-sector pensions and an American aversion to raising taxes. In a place that cannot afford firefighters and police, he meets a British neuroscientist who blames the ill-design of the human brain. Hardwired to be gorgers, people in environments of abundance have sacrificed long-term interests for short-term rewards. It is a troubling end to a thought-provoking read.</p>",
  "<p>With <em>Killing Them Softly</em> the Australian writer-director Andrew Dominik confirms his reputation as a film-maker of great confidence with a steady eye and a sharp focus on what to date is a single subject: crime as a way of life. His first picture, <em>Chopper</em>, made 12 years ago, was a portrait of the notorious Mark \"Chopper\" Read, a psychopathic criminal, terrifyingly impersonated by Eric Bana, who became some sort of national hero in Australia as a bestselling author and a media celebrity. Dominik, however, expected audiences to bring too much with them in the way of existing knowledge of the man and his background. As a result, for British moviegoers at least, the film, though gripping, took place in a social vacuum.</p> <p>There was no such problem with his second picture, made seven years later, a masterly re-examination of a familiar American legend. In the western <em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em> Dominik took a cool, measured look at the celebrated post-civil war outlaw and the young follower whose admiration developed into a bizarre hatred. In both pictures he showed a fascination for the way his characters talked and addressed their world \u2013 the colourful Australian vernacular of the criminals in <em>Chopper</em>, the formal vocabulary of the King James Bible and the Book of Common Prayer in <em>Jesse James</em>.</p> <p>These interests are carried on in <em>Killing Them Softly,</em> which is closely based on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781409137535/cogans-trade\" title=\"\"><em>Cogan's Trade</em></a>, a 1974 novel by George V Higgins, a prolific author of crime fiction, most of it now out of print. Dominik came across Higgins as a result of catching a TV screening of <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em>, a bleak, downbeat movie based on his first novel which starred Robert Mitchum at his most vulnerable as a petty Irish-American crook exploited by smarter hoodlums and unscrupulous cops. It's the only film, I believe, to be based on a Higgins book.</p> <p>Higgins, who died in 1999 aged 60, was an assistant US attorney for Massachusetts when <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em> appeared in 1970. It became an immediate success as a result of such encomia as Ross Macdonald calling it \"the most powerful and frightening crime novel I have read this year\", and Norman Mailer opining: \"What dialogue\u2026 What I can't get over is that so good a first novel was written by the fuzz.\" Nearly all Higgins's characters are male Irish-American crooks and law enforcers who drive around Boston or sit in bars, talking endlessly, colourfully, obscenely, cryptically, about their lives, their work, their dreams. His books are virtually plays, their pared down narration reading like stage directions by Hemingway. Writing about his second novel in 1973, I said he belonged in the company of Hammett and Chandler. But re-evaluating him today in terms of Jorge Luis Borges's claim that \"each writer creates his precursors\", I see him as the forerunner of David Mamet and Elmore Leonard. Anyway, Higgins is fortunate to have been rediscovered by Dominik, and Dominik is lucky to have found him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tDyaNnrgdp4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tDyaNnrgdp4?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><em>Killing Them Softly</em> is the story of a heist that goes wrong. Two noisome low-lifes just out of jail are hired by an ambitious minor criminal (\"we're not the very smartest guys in the world,\" he rightly observes) to rob a backroom poker school with the intention of framing another guy for the job. They succeed in an edgily mounted robbery that is all menace and suspense but no violence. The Mob, however, have an interest in protecting such businesses and dispatch a fastidious middle-class lawyer (Richard Jenkins) to handle matters. He hires the smart hitman Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt, who played Jesse James in Dominik's second film) to track down the miscreants. The film unfolds in a succession of dialogues in bars and cars, a good many of the lines coming directly from Higgins and all of them in his style. They're brilliantly delivered by as fine a cast as Hollywood has assembled since the film of Mamet's <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>. It's all far sadder and far funnier than <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em>, with the characters using language as a form of armour and weaponry, only occasionally saying precisely what they mean. The stylised, brilliantly turned exchanges are punctuated by often stunningly staged outbursts of violence, including one particular killing in slow motion that makes us feel we're spectators at the&#xa0;apocalypse.</p> <p>Dominik effects a couple of major changes to Higgins's text. First he removes the action from Boston to a grim, rain-drenched unnamed American city. (It was shot in and around New Orleans but there's nothing particularly southern about it.) Second, he sets it very specifically in 2008, and the political and moral context is a nation in a state of economic crisis with an idealistic man constantly on radio and TV using a stale, overheated rhetoric to bring Americans together to face these challenges as a united democratic community.</p> <p>The film's characters are at best ambivalent to these events. At worst they mock them consciously or indirectly. Jackie Cogan, the movie's dominant figure, takes the express position that since the days of the Founding Fathers, America has been a nation of selfish, self-seeking individuals, and that the country's business is business. As the suave lawyer who bankrolls the heist in John Huston's <em>The Asphalt Jungle</em> (a film made 17 years before Dominik was born) puts it: \"After all, crime is only a left-handed form of human endeavour.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>You're in London playing the title role in <em>Miss Julie </em>\u2013 or rather <em>Mademoiselle Julie</em>, a modern-day production of the Strindberg play by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fisbach. Aside from being in French, is it much different from the original?</strong></p> <p>I hope it's different; when a text has been played over and over, you hope to get a new view of it. When I reread it, I was struck by how modern the play is, in what it says about women and the consequences of emancipation. However, the aristocratic side of the play seemed a little old to me. I feel like the more significant differences in France today are between immigrants and non-immigrants. I thought it would be so interesting if Jean [the servant with whom Julie, a count's daughter, has an ill-fated love affair] was, for example, a north African man dealing with a white woman.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel sympathy for Julie?</strong></p> <p>Yes, and I do for Jean as well \u2013 even considering how he behaves in the play. It's not about condemning anybody: the thing is to understand why people behave in certain ways. These two are stuck in their emotions. At some moments you think they could go away and live happily, but their needs, their language, their expectations are different, so they cannot meet. It's fascinating.</p> <p><strong>When you premiered this production in Avignon last year, it was your first theatrical role for more than a decade. Were you apprehensive?</strong></p> <p>No, I wouldn't say that. There was a lot of expectation of course, but the need to be in a play was stronger. Also, I did the dance show [<em>in-i,</em> with Akram Khan in 2008] a hundred times in 11 different countries so, no, I didn't feel apprehensive.</p> <p><strong>You only had four months to train as a dancer for that show. Were you happy with the outcome?</strong></p> <p>Was I happy? I don't really think that way. Did I feel that I gave the most I could? I think I did. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/21/dance\" title=\"\">experience in London</a> [where the show premiered] was a little tough to start with \u2013 I felt people were a little harsh, because it was such a risk.</p> <p><strong>You've worked with some extraordinary directors \u2013 Godard, Kie\u015blowski, Haneke. You must have learnt a lot from them?</strong></p> <p>Yes, definitely. It still happens. Most recently, with Bruno Dumont, playing [the sculptor] Camille Claudel in a film that hasn't come out yet. I loved the flexibility he brought to the creative process. I had learned some of Claudel's letters by heart, and he asked me to forget everything and improvise her thoughts in my own words. That was very challenging but I loved it, because it was freeing in a way, and very intense.</p> <p><strong>Other directors seek to control every detail. Which approach do you prefer?</strong></p> <p>I love both ways. Michael Haneke, for example, is so precise. It's like mathematics, like music \u2013 he was training to be a musician to start with, so it's very much in him, that need for control and precision. But for directors like Dumont, the need for truth is beyond the need for precision. It doesn't mean Haneke is not looking for a true moment but it's being cooked differently [in his films]. I invited Bruno and Michael to dinner recently, and it was so interesting. Bruno was saying when he doesn't get what he expected he lets it go and transforms it into something else. Whereas Michael would never let go, he keeps going until he gets what he wants.</p> <p><strong>Would you like to direct?</strong></p> <p>Yes, although I don't feel frustrated creatively [as an actor]. I have stories that I'd like to maybe one day consider directing but you need a lot of time to write and put it together.</p> <p><strong>And you don't have much free time?</strong></p> <p>Not at the moment, no. There's the time for the children [Raphael, 19, and Hana, 12] and then your parents [are] getting old, and then the demands of being an actor \u2013 promotion, reading and meeting with directors, watching plays and films \u2013 plus life. There's a lot going on.</p> <p><strong>You had a cameo in <em>Cosmopolis</em>, playing Robert Pattison's art dealer and lover \u2026 </strong></p> <p>That was great. I was astonished to see how much of a cinephile Robert was, and how ambitious \u2013 he wants to produce and has strong views of what he wants to do in the movie world.</p> <p><strong>He's been going through a tough time \u2026</strong></p> <p>Well I witnessed Jude Law going through hell as well \u2013 it can be a nightmare when people have to deal with their intimacies in public. It's not respectful, so I felt for him and for her [Kristen Stewart] as well.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel satisfied with your own level of privacy?</strong></p> <p>I'm guarding it. I'm not being bothered.</p> <p><strong>Does living in Paris help?</strong></p> <p>Each time there's been some sort of tabloid trouble I've attacked out of principle and I've always won because that's the law here \u2013 you're not supposed to be bothered by photographers \u2026 All these stories, it feels like being in a bad soap opera all the time. You feel like you've got to resist that stupidity. It's very weird.</p> <p><strong>You played a journalist in <em>Elles</em>. Did that give you any sympathy for the trade?</strong></p> <p>[Laughs]. I've played journalists before, and I have good friends who are journalists. I think being an actor is not very far from being a journalist. Because you investigate, you try to understand, you're asking questions, you're interested in the other.</p> <p><strong>What other projects are in the pipeline?</strong></p> <p>I'll be doing a film with Erik Poppe, a Norwegian director, playing a war photographer. And another film with Clive Owen called <em>Words and Pictures</em>. He's playing an English teacher and I'm playing an art teacher. And next summer I'll be in Olivier Assayas's new movie, playing an actress. It's about her life and how she's getting older.</p> <p><strong>Will that be a poignant role to play?</strong></p> <p>But it's my reality! [laughs] I'm all for life, darling! I take life as it comes.</p>",
  "<p>Tens of billions of pounds of investment in low-carbon, job-creating energy infrastructure projects that are \"ready to go\" could be lost to Britain because of an anti-green movement that is sweeping through the Tory party, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary warns today.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, Ed Davey describes a \"Tea Party tendency\" among Conservative MPs who question climate change and green investment as \"perverse\", and says it is creating deep uncertainty for an industry that could do much to help lift the country out of the economic doldrums.</p> <p>Davey is careful not to take aim at George Osborne, who is increasingly sceptical about the green agenda, but makes it clear that the \"noise\" created by some of the chancellor's \"friends\" on the anti-green Tory right risks putting off investors for good. \"Noises off at the margins are undermining investors' confidence and that is undermining green growth, and that is undermining the central purpose of the government, which is deficit reduction,\" Davey says.</p> <p>He says he has confidence in Osborne to continue backing the green agenda, even if some of those around him are urging him to take a different course: \"Of course some of these people are his [Osborne's] friends \u2013 some of these people on the margins \u2013 but he is going to be judged by growth. The Conservative party is going to be judged by growth. The Liberal Democrats are going to be judged by growth.\"</p> <p>Over recent months the Tory party, including David Cameron and Osborne, has appeared to dilute its enthusiasm for green policies that defined its supposed \"modernisation\" drive in the runup to the 2010 general election. Osborne is said to have formed the view that green policies such as investment in windfarms and solar power are too costly at a time of recession. He is understood to have been swayed by arguments put forward by the former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson, a climate change sceptic.</p> <p>Davey says, however, that there are huge opportunities for the British economy from investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure projects, including wind and solar energy, carbon capture storage and new nuclear power, all of which make up a large part of projected spending of \u00a3118bn in the sector over the next decade. Last year alone \u00a312.7bn was invested in this country by the renewable energy industry, creating 20,000 jobs.</p> <p>Davey says he fears these opportunities will be lost if the pre-election consensus on climate change and green policies continues to be questioned. \"If there is not seen to be that consensus investors are going to balk. When you hear all that noise on the right of politics that worries investors. They think, 'Well if I am going to put all this money in \u2013 it is a 30-year investment \u2013 I need to know that if the government changes we are not going to have some rightwing Tea Party tendency taking over.' \"</p> <p>Last week the head of the Swedish firm Vattenfall, which opened its third British offshore windfarm on Wednesday, said the UK would fail to tempt wind turbine manufacturers to set up in the country because of the uncertainties about future government policy. \"If you look at the UK, not one supplier has established itself yet because of uncertainty in the future,\" said Oystein Loseth.</p> <p>Describing the arguments of the Tory right as perverse, Davey said he could not believe so many Conservatives failed to see the economic benefits of investment in green infrastructure, much of which would be from the private sector and so off the government's books. \"Energy infrastructure is going to drive growth and what is even more significant is that a lot of the energy projects are shovel-ready \u2013 they are ready go tomorrow.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"We have to win this argument for the future: it is almost like we have to re-win it. I am confident that if I was the chancellor I would want growth.\"</p> <p>As the Lib Dem conference opened in Brighton, Tory hostility to the green agenda was top of the agenda. Among those taking on Osborne will be his deputy Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, who has proposed a motion condemning \"the refusal of the Conservatives to acknowledge that investing in carbon-reducing technologies has the potential to make an important contribution to long-term growth\".</p> <p>Davey also made it clear that he was in favour of introducing a legal goal to decarbonise the power sector by 2030 \u2013 something also opposed by Osborne \u2013 although he said he believed this could be done through secondary legislation and with less stringent conditions than were being proposed by many of the green groups.</p> <p>He described the former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry, who was enthusiastic about renewable energy but sacked in the recent reshuffle, as a \"brilliant minister\" and said he had no idea why he had been dismissed from the post. \"I genuinely don't know [why he was sacked] because I have not had a conversation with the prime minister. I do know that Charles Hendry was a brilliant minister,\" said Davey.</p> <p>While Osborne is known to be enthusiastic about a new \"dash for gas\" \u2013 which he sees as crucial to the country's future energy needs \u2013 Davey was sceptical about over-reliance on gas. In particular he questioned whether exploration of shale gas in the UK would change the need for a balanced energy policy. \"As far as the British shale gas story is concerned I don't think it is a game changer at all, as we would still be dependent on imports.\"</p>",
  "<p>Break-ups hurt. They hurt like hell, even for the partner who has provoked the separation.

With such practices, anger and fury come to stand in for broken hearts and they cast aside the capacity to mourn a lost love and think about what the children require of each parent.</p> <p>Of course, it's all too easy to blame lawyers when a bullish stand is often appreciated by divorcing individuals who are devastated or who, conversely, feel guilty. The tough stances provide a temporary emotional shield against the continuing hurt and confusions.</p> <p>But if antagonism becomes the form of engagement, then both parties get stuck in a ghastly pas de deux<em> \u2013 </em>see the Kavanaghs \u2013<em> </em>creating a relationship in which the other is the enemy rather than a relationship that retains affection for what once was. The two people are as connected as ever before, but on the ghoulish basis of hate, rage and misunderstanding.</p> <p>No one is released and perhaps that is the point. Some people will prefer to be connected <em>negatively</em> rather than not at all. If there is a third party involved, then antipathy with the ex can often be used to bolster potential cracks in the new relationship, particularly if that relationship had clandestine origins. The conspiratorial thrust may persist with a continuing need to bond against the \"wicked\" wife or husband. There is a threesome afoot, rather than a separated couple.</p> <p>No one leaves a long-term relationship scot-free or without conflict. But as long as the healing is interrupted by continual belligerence on the side of one party, as can often happen when the law gets involved, we can assume that the belligerent is unsteady. She or he is using attack to bolster emotional fragility and treating the other as if they were still in a partnership and had emotional claims on one another. When this happens on both sides, it makes provision for the children extremely challenging.</p> <p>From this regard, from the child's viewpoint, a new HBO documentary, <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/#/schedule/detail/Don't+Divorce+Me!+Kids'+Rules+for+Parents+on+Divorce/555234\" title=\"\"><em>Don't Divorce Me</em></a><em>,</em> extracts of which can now be seen online, promises more good sense from the children than was evident from the adults last week. \"Try to make sure that your kids get both parents kind of equally\"; \"tell me it's not my fault\"; \"learn to get along\" are some of the \"rules\" offered by the young children of divorce in the film. Common sense, you might think, but how often is this missing from their parents' outlook?</p> <p>From a child's point of view, there is rarely a great time for parents to separate, even if there has been a lot of commotion and fighting. Children want what they have grown up with (which is an argument for very early separation if the couple are really unable to co-operate). They find change in familial arrangements disconcerting and painful. If their parents have been together until they are eight or 14, or even 19 and 26, their internal world is structured to see themselves in relation to that set-up.</p> <p>What makes it harder or easier depends entirely on how the separating couple manage their own relationship and their arrangements with the children. At a minimum, consistency is what is required. It is also crucial that the children are allowed to have a relationship with each parent without being inveigled into spying or message- bearing. \"Don't put me in the middle,\" says one of the children in the HBO documentary.</p> <p>It isn't for children to sort out things for the parents. It isn't for children to take on the attitude of a parent who feels aggrieved and delivers that to the other parent. Both parents need to ensure that they have the \"cleanest\" possible relationship with their children so that the children can trust the parent to look out for them. The parents' job is to be there for their kids, not the other way round. Troubles between parents need to be talked through with friends and not visited on the children.</p> <p>But since we all know these verities, the question arises: why do they get so easily derailed? Why do individuals who can be apparently wise and straightforward elsewhere in their lives so mistreat their children and their ex-loves? Perhaps it's something to do with a sense of responsibility, or lack of it.</p> <p>The concept of no-fault divorce that is now legally enshrined (and is a good thing in itself) can unintentionally result in the individuals believing that they bear no responsibility for the breakdown. But \"no fault\" does not mean \"no responsibility\".</p> <p>In fact, the eliding of the one into the other \u2013 confusing technical and moral terms, and adults not taking responsibility, can get in the way of managing the fallout. What's more, there are hardly children anywhere who don't worry that at some level it was their fault that their parents couldn't stay together or get on once they are separated..</p> <p>Grow up, then, is the simple call to adults who are breaking up or divorcing. There is no way to avoid the pain of separation, but there is a means to shorten its duration.</p> <p>Take charge of your own behaviour. And don't expect that others \u2013 the courts, the lawyers or the children \u2013 will solve the anguish and sorrows that divorce brings. You owe it to yourselves and your children.</p>",
  "<p>The UK may have \"entered into a double-dip recession\", gushes the latest issue of <em>Legal Business</em>, a glossy magazine for corporate lawyers, \"but the UK's top law firms continue to post record growth and trend-busting profits.\"</p> <p>So they do. The upper end of the law is top-heavy with money. Jonathan Sumption QC earned the largest barrister's fee ever when he pocketed a reported \u00a35m for representing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/roman-abramovich-court-boris-berezovsky\" title=\"\">Roman Abramovich in his fight with Boris Berezovsky</a>. Profits at the richest 100 London law firms hit more than \u00a35bn for the first time last year. The richest seven paid their partners more than \u00a31m each.</p> <p>In Tuscan second homes the chianti is flowing because oligarchs and global corporations cannot get enough of the English legal system.</p> <p>Speaking last year to Clifford Chance, whose partners brought in \u00a31.3bn in 2011, the then justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, accepted that the legal business had \"felt itself to be something of an overlooked Cinderella in its treatment by government\" \u2013 an odd description to use when partners in City law firms resemble no one so much as the Ugly Sisters, but I'll let it pass. The coalition now recognised the money to be made from litigation and wanted to push English legal services into the emerging markets. \"The UK may no longer be able to boast that it is the workshop of the world,\" Clarke declared. \"But the UK can be lawyer to the world.\" In the 1990s and 2000s, government thought that financial services offered a future for post-industrial Britain. Now, it sees legal services as our saviour.</p> <p>Ministers' ambition is embodied in the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/rcj-rolls-building/rolls-building\" title=\"\">Rolls Building</a>, which curves like a luxury liner near Fetter Lane in the City. The new home for commercial courts has none of the fustiness of the old, neogothic high court on the Strand. Opened last year at a cost of \u00a3300m, it looks like the headquarters for a fashionable tech firm: all glass and steel, and with a central atrium from where a spiral staircase twists up towards the sky.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice hopes it will help Britain become the \"largest specialist centre for the resolution of financial, business and property litigation anywhere in the world\" and on the face of it, there seems little to object to in that. I have many criticisms of the judiciary, but I have never entertained the notion that an English judge would take a bribe or succumb to pressure from the state. You cannot say the same of judges in Moscow, New Delhi or Beijing. The incorruptibility of the judiciary and the work ethic of the lawyers ensure that more international commercial disputes take place in London than in any other city in the world. And of course we need whatever taxes the lawyers' accountants condescend to pass to the Revenue.</p> <p>\"Wimbledonisation\" is an ugly term business writers reach for on these occasions. Andy Murray apart, we may not have great tennis players, they say, but in commerce, as in sport, we can still host the best foreign players.</p> <p>Yet there are already signs that this trend in English law will be as great a disappointment as it was in English finance. Even Abramovich's solicitors accepted that the sceptical may wonder what a dispute about the division of the loot from the old Soviet empire had to do with us.</p> <p>The British taxpayer saw no direct benefit. Mrs Justice Gloster began hearing the Abramovich case on 3 October 2011. The proceedings lasted until 21 December 2011. She considered her verdict until 31 August 2012, and still has months more to spend writing her judgment.</p> <p>For this service, the public purse received next to nothing. High Court and Court of Appeal users pay \u00a31,090 for a trial hearing regardless of its length. The Ministry of Justice suggested last year that it might raise the price of High Court and Court of Appeal cases lasting more than 10 days to \u00a310,900, but that would still not cover the costs of a fresh battle between the oligarchs and in any case nothing has been done.</p> <p>Like the National Theatre and the House of Windsor, the law is subsidised by the taxpayer because it brings in the tourists, but in this instance they are the wealthiest tourists on the planet who can afford to pay their way.</p> <p>Beyond the freeloading lies an existential question: who is the law for? Sitting in London, it is not too fanciful to imagine the legal system of England and Wales detaching itself from the peoples of England and Wales.</p> <p>Its best lawyers no longer want to work for them, because they cannot afford their fees. Its judges cannot hear their disputes for months because they are tied up hearing the disputes of plutocrats.</p> <p>As we already know, the government's cuts to legal aid mean that ministers are deliberately placing the poorest beyond the law. On matters of vital concern \u2013 housing, debt, benefit claim \u2013 they will have no access to justice.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ministers tell the middle classes to settle their disputes by arbitration, which is a reasonable way for reasonable people to reach an agreement, but if one of the parties is unreasonable the middle classes still need judges and lawyers to intervene. They are becoming harder to find. A senior judge told me that he knew British corporate lawyers who had never represented a human being. Soon we will have British corporate lawyers who have never represented a British company either.</p> <p>With the exception of a few judges, there is no resistance to the law's embrace of bling. After pocketing his Russian gold, Sumption was elevated from being a working barrister to a seat in the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.</p> <p>Like Peter Bazalgette, who made a fortune from broadcasting trash and has been rewarded with the chairmanship of the Arts Council, Sumption found that the modern British state celebrates the accumulation of money by whatever means necessary. The richer you are the more deserving of honours you become.</p> <p>The credit crunch was so severe in Britain because the Wimbledonisation of finance ended when the crash forced all the foreign banks the government had encouraged to come to these islands to head home and take their credit for families and businesses with them.</p> <p>In the legal world, it will end when the people realise that the law of the land is the law of everybody's land but theirs.</p>",
  "<p>When Mothercare opened its first store in 1961 a \"baby travel system\" was still better known as a pram and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, was still in short trousers. Today the maternity and parenting market it serves is unrecognisable thanks to the aggressive expansion of the major supermarkets and internet home shopping \u2013 as well as savvy members of Mumsnet scanning the message boards for money-saving tips.</p> <p>This week will see life get even harder for Mothercare \u2013 struggling, but still the market leader \u2013 as Kiddicare, the website backed by supermarket giant Morrisons, opens the first of a new wave of superstores.</p> <p>\"Shoppers will be wowed by the massive choice of product,\" says Kiddicare's chief executive, Scott Weavers-Wright, of the Nottingham store which opens on Wednesday. \"Mothercare are next door with 10 to 15 pushchairs, but you'll walk into Kiddicare and see 350.\"</p> <p>The government-backed Money Advice Service estimates that, even without childcare, a new baby can cost up to \u00a37,200 in its first year, making new arrivals more expensive than the family car and a lucrative area for hard-pressed retailers. Due to the breadth of the market, which takes in childrenswear as well as nursery furniture and toys, estimates of its worth vary. Childrenswear offers the biggest prize, with sales of nearly \u00a35bn, while Kiddicare is focused on the \u00a31bn baby equipment market \u2013 although a Morrisons childrenswear brand called Nutmeg is in the offing.</p> <p>Last year Morrisons snapped up family-owned Kiddicare for \u00a370m in a bid to attract more families with young children. The grocer does not punch its weight with these high-spending, frequent shoppers, and it upped the ante by picking up 10 superstores from retreating US electricals chain Best Buy to expand Kiddicare's physical presence.</p> <p>Like the newborns it is supposed to cater for, Mothercare has been the source of sleepless nights for its investors. The company has lost more than two thirds of its stock market value in the past two years and Simon Calver, the new chief executive appointed in April, has been charged with a major turnaround; last year the company fell to a loss of \u00a3102.9m. The retailer is accused of chasing overseas glory \u2013 it has stores in 59 countries including Nigeria and Kazakhstan \u2013 but forgetting about shoppers at home, losing its competitive edge on pricing and letting customer service deteriorate.</p> <p>While Mothercare was gallivanting across Asia and Africa, its home market got more sophisticated. Today, babies have gyms, not just dummies, and manufacturers of top-end strollers sell accessories such as \"paparazzi shields\" for celebrity offspring. The US tradition of baby showers has also gained traction: retailers such as John Lewis offer premium services like wedding-style gift lists for newborns.</p> <p>With many parents determined to give their children the best, new retailing names have also prospered. Last year upmarket nursery brand Mamas &amp; Papas, founded in 1981, reported turnover of \u00a3135.2m with, and a spate of openings took the Huddersfield-based chain, started by married couple Luisa and David Scacchetti, to more than 60 stores.</p> <p>A trawl through Mumsnet's notoriously charged message boards shows almost universal approval for the shopping experience offered by Kiddicare \u2013 although one customer is less complimentary on its own website (\"my pre-order item is still not here and would like my money back\"). The Nottingham store boasts a buggy \"test track\", a VIB (\"very important baby\") personal shopping service and community rooms to host showers and baby massage classes.</p> <p>Weavers-Wright promises a \"non-pushy\" atmosphere: \"We've created some community areas so mums can hang out for two or three hours \u2026 we want them to do that.\" With customers armed to the hilt with information, thanks to price comparison and social networking websites, he admits the in-store Wi-Fi will mean customers can \"price-check as they browse\".</p> <p>Over at Mothercare, Calver is not due to update the City until November, but there are early signs of the direction the former Lovefilm boss plans to take. A newly refurbished store in Edmonton, north London, offers all manner of bells and whistles, with \"diddly dance\" sessions for fractious toddlers and an ultrasound studio offering 4D baby scans. Mothercare is also sorting out its basic commercial housekeeping, matching rivals' prices and, given the straitened economic climate, introducing a value range that includes children's T-shirts for \u00a32.50 and jeans for \u00a36.</p> <p>Weavers-Wright confirms that shoppers, whatever their income, are increasingly looking to save money: \"Customers who want to buy an expensive Stokke high chair or pushchair continue to do so but there has been a gradual movement to own brand, value ranges.\"</p> <p>Kiddicare's expansion threatens to do more harm to Mothercare than good for Morrisons. With annual sales of around \u00a350m, the website is a sideshow for the Bradford-based grocer. It is grappling with loss of market share at its supermarket, which has sales of \u00a317bn. Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley, who rates Morrisons a sell, has reservations about the direction chief executive Dalton Philips is taking it in, with the new upmarket look developed for its stores possibly alienating poorer shoppers. \"It is a very big business \u2013 and it will take time for some its other growth avenues to become meaningful and shift the dial.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the ink dries on <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/berezovsky-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">the 539-page judgment</a> handed down last week to settle the seething row between Russian tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, the British legal gravy train this week returns once more to fellow feuding oligarchs Michael Cherney and Oleg Deripaska.</p> <p>Once again the dispute turns on whether past payments and disputed historic contracts amounted to one oligarch promising a slice of his empire to the other, or whether, in fact, the money flows were evidence of krysha payments \u2013 that is, protection money.</p> <p>The case briefly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/oleg-deripaska-litigant-criminal-court\" title=\"\">got under way in July</a>, when Deripaska's counsel, Tom Beazley QC, declared that Cherney was a man who had \"surrounded himself with criminal characters ... they were part of his modus operandi\".</p> <p>The hearing resumes on Thursday and one of the first witnesses is expected to be Cherney, giving him the chance to rebut Beazley in person. Well, sort of in person. In fact, he will be giving evidence via video link. The small matter of an outstanding Interpol warrant makes travelling a difficulty.</p> <p>Whatever this week brings from Court 25 of London's high court Rolls Building, it will be treble vodkas all round for the legion of advisers in attendance from law firms Quinn Emanuel and Decherts and spin doctors Bell Pottinger and Portland PR.</p> <h2>Shareholder group eyes Micro Focus chief's perks<br></h2> <p>Next on the pay revolt danger list is Micro Focus, one of the last big British software companies with a near \u00a31bn market value.</p> <p>Shareholder advisory group Pirc wants a vote against the re-election of executive chairman Kevin Loosemore and a thumbs down for the remuneration policy at Micro Focus's annual meeting on Wednesday.</p> <p>The company's PR man points out that the share price is up 70% since Loosemore's appointment in April 2011, but Pirc feels combining the roles of chairman and chief executive gives one individual too much control. It also does not like the termination provisions in Loosemore's contract. A year's pay in lieu of notice is standard for top executives, but Loosemore is entitled to a year and a half's worth of pay \u2013 a not-to-be-sniffed-at \u00a3735,000.</p> <p>Last year he took home nearly \u00a31.3m including base salary of \u00a3490,000 and a bonus of \u00a3662,000. The annual report states that this year's bonuses will have clawback provisions, although it also says dismissal could see the boss claim \"all of the bonus which would have become payable up to the date of notice being served by the company\". Perhaps a pay consultant could explain.</p> <h2>Food firms get hungry<br></h2> <p>Food companies Compass and Domino's Pizza Group are also due to shuffle into the City canteen this week. The London-listed pizza firm that controls the Domino's franchise in the UK and Ireland is expanding fast. It bought out the Swiss franchisee at the end of August and investors are looking for news on how the integration is going.</p> <p>Over at Compass, which is updating the market ahead of full-year results on 21 November, the company's already significant overseas activities seem to have insulated it from the UK's depressed economy. Panmure Gordon analysts point out that the share price has risen nearly 40% in the last 12&#xa0;months, comfortably outperforming the 16% increase in the FTSE 100. Time to crack open the champagne and foie gras?</p> <p><em>Au contraire</em>. Compass announced last month that it had decided to remove the livers of force-fed geese from its menus. The change will have affected its smattering of upmarket eateries, including those run by Gary Rhodes, whose signature dishes had included fillet steak burgers topped with melting foie gras. But profits are unlikely to be affected, given Compass does much of its business in school and hospital canteens and is perhaps more famous for once dishing up Turkey Twizzlers.</p>",
  "<p>James Flynn studied mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago, before switching to political philosophy. Currently, he is a professor of political studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand. His name has been lent to the \"Flynn effect\" \u2013 his discovery that IQ scores have risen significantly from one generation to another over the past century. He is 78.</p> <p><strong>What does IQ measure?</strong><br>That depends what it's used for. Sometimes, an IQ test is a force for good. You have a kid at school who is doing badly and you think he seems brighter than that. You give him an IQ test and he knocks the socks out of it. So it can be used to help diagnose an individual's educational problems. Some universities use IQ tests as part of an entrance exam.</p> <p>The second thing they are often used for is to measure the difference between groups. But this works only if their quality of environment is roughly comparable.</p> <p><strong>Your book, <em>Are We Getting Smarter?</em>, talks about the recent IQ gains made by women.</strong><br>Women today match men but only in advanced countries, where women get an equal shake. One of the most interesting things is that at university women do have IQs about two points lower than men, maybe three, and a lot of scholars say: \"Ah-ha, that means women aren't as bright\", but why do you think that might be?</p> <p><strong>Is it to do with the type of people who pursue going to university?</strong><br>Well, it has to do with the fact that, if you take a girl of 17 from secondary school with an IQ of 100, she will get better grades than the typical boy. So that means that the girl with the IQ of 100 may well get to university and the boy won't. So the male sample is more elite; it has a higher threshold. This reveals one of the disturbing things about British education: if you look at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics, at the end of secondary school, only the top third of boys matches the top half of girls for reading. In America, only the top quarter of boys matches the top half of girls for written composition. This is why so many women are beginning to dominate journalism and law.</p> <p><strong>If I took an early IQ test, would I find it baffling the way the problems are set?</strong><br>No, you would knock the socks out of it because people who designed the early IQ test were ahead of their time. They were highly professional people who had been schooled in the scientific ethos, and they weren't typical of their day. Let's take a question that you would get and an intelligent person of 1900 might not: if you were asked: \"What do dogs and rabbits have in common?\", what would you say?</p> <p><strong>They are both mammals.</strong><br>Correct. A kid in 1900 would say: \"You use dogs to hunt rabbits.\" He would get the question wrong because, before people had lots of formal schooling, they had a utilitarian mentality, and they were fixated on the concrete world and using it to advantage. You've been raised in a scientific world where you think classifying things is an obvious prerequisite for understanding them. To you, a dog and a rabbit are just mammals; you are not interested in whether it is a beagle and good for hunting rabbits. So IQ gains over time are totally fascinating if you know how to interpret them and don't just run around saying: \"Are we getting more intelligent?\"</p> <p><strong>So these observations show that IQ is determined by environment rather than genes?</strong><br>At the individual level, genes are important, as they are for other qualities such as height.</p> <p>It's very different, however, to use IQ to compare groups and say that, because one group has a lower mean IQ, that shows that it is genetically inferior. For example, if you look at developing nations, there are six for which we have good IQ data. Three of these are making gains faster now than we Europeans are. These are Turkey, Brazil and Kenya and I predict that eventually all three of them are going to match us for IQ. As for the three other nations, there is nothing the matter with their genes but with their circumstances. You have Sudan, where they keep having civil wars; you have Saudi Arabia, where most of them are sitting around feather-bedding on oil wells; and you have the Dominican Republic, where they have their infrastructure wiped out every 10 years by hurricanes, tsunamis and tornadoes. There is nothing the matter with their genes, but if Britain had all of its infrastructure destroyed every 10 years, it wouldn't be doing so well.</p> <p><strong>You have also described something you call the \"bright tax\".</strong><br>It has always been thought that bright people's minds deteriorated less after the age of 65. I found that that was true for verbal abilities, but the brighter you are the faster your analytical abilities deteriorate after 65, all the way down the scale. Even the average person deteriorates more quickly than the below-average. That sets an interesting question. Is the good analytic brain, like a high-performance sports car, something that requires more maintenance in old age than the body can give it \u2013 that would be a physiological hypothesis. Or is it that we mainly use our analytic ability at work, so that if you are bright you have a cognitively demanding job and when you retire you are like an athlete who has lost his exercise advantage.</p> <p><strong>How would one mitigate this cognitive decline post-65: do crosswords, take up running, learn a new language?</strong><br>Mental exercise will do you good at any age. Even if your brain is deteriorating, it will deteriorate more slowly if you use it. Just as while I can't run 10k anything like [as fast as] when I was young, if you are really out of shape, even at 78, I could give you a hard time.</p> <p><strong>Are you going to tell me your time for 10k?</strong><br>When I was young it was 32 minutes, and in those days the world record was around 29. When I was 66, I could still run it in 45\u00bd. My ability to run at under 50 minutes has receded since I have entered my 70s.</p> <p><strong>Other than the obvious physical benefits, why do you run?</strong><br>There is no doubt that the blood supply to the brain, due to a cardiovascular system that is efficient, helps intelligence in the pre-frontal lobes; that is true. I don't do it for that reason, but I am sure that I get the benefit.</p> <p>There was a wonderful study by the OECD where they gave a test of working memory \u2013 what a pity it wasn't a test of analytical ability, but it wasn't \u2013 and they divided the countries into those like France, where 80% of people retired between 55-65, and those like Sweden and Switzerland, where 80% were still in work, and the loss on working memory in France for that age was twice as great. Which tells us that, if you kept exercising your brain at work, your working memory held up better.</p> <p><strong>You have written four books this year, including one about climate change.</strong><br>I kept the book under 100 pages, it is called <em>Climate Change and the Environment</em> \u2013 I'm looking for a publisher. I guarantee anyone can read it in less than four hours and learn what they need to know.</p> <p>My conclusion is that, yes, we are making a contribution. At one time, the climate sceptics had a case, but their case is now falling apart. Keep your eye on the west Antarctic ice shelf: we are in trouble. It looks as if it's going to go, and, even if half of it goes over the next century, that will raise sea levels by three metres, and your beloved London is going to be in a fix.</p> <p>Laser fusion is probably the best long-range hope for clean energy: that is where you bombard heavy hydrogen with fusion to try to set up an interaction that would actually generate more energy than you put into it. But that research is probably about 70 years away from being dominant. Before then we are going to need a stopgap.</p> <p>Are We Getting Smarter?<em> by James R Flynn is published by Cambridge University Press (\u00a316.99)</em></p>",

First&#xa0;and foremost is simply forgetting names. It's no good saying: \"How do you spell your name?\" if the answer's going to be B-R-O-W-N, and&#xa0;not much better trying: \"When did we meet last?\" if it turns out you both work in the same office. You can break an actor's heart by asking: \"What do you do?\" though mend it by:&#xa0;\"I&#xa0;thought you seemed familiar\"; and a senior-looking author should never be asked: \"Are you still writing?\", though: \"What are&#xa0;you writing at the moment?\" is safe&#xa0;enough.

The documentary, which features contributions from more than 60 interviewees including members of the Vreeland family, as well as fashion designers Oscar de la Renta, Diane von Furstenberg and Calvin Klein, was made on a shoestring budget. \"I applied for every grant going and got nothing,\" says Immordino Vreeland, who is married to Alexander, the son of Diana's youngest child and lives in New York. \"I mean, I was a first-time director and all I knew about her going into this was the caricature \u2013 this exaggerated woman with exaggerated makeup. I had no sense of proximity to this character. But what I did have was access.\"</p> <p>The resulting film is a fascinating glimpse into the life of an unconventional woman, as well as a brief canter through the history of the 20th century. Diana Vreeland was born in 1903 and died in 1989. She rebelled against her privileged upbringing and spent the 1920s in Harlem jazz clubs. In the 30s, she came into contact with Hitler and provided lingerie to Wallis Simpson, the woman who would later cause Edward VIII to abdicate. In the 60s, she dazzled Hollywood and befriended Warren Beatty, Cher, Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston.</p> <p>\"She was a feminist without realising it,\" says Immordino Vreeland, who never met her subject. \"There was nothing conscious about what she was doing but her life became very much about her work.\"</p> <p>As a consequence, Vreeland was a less-than-perfect mother. Her two sons, Tim and Frederick (\"Frecky\"), appear in the film, recalling her as a distant, occasionally cold presence. And yet many of those interviewed remember Vreeland as a blazing force of nature: a woman who celebrated eccentricity and insisted that imperfection was the most interesting part of beauty.</p> <p>If they had met, would Immordino Vreeland have liked her? \"Yes, but maybe she wouldn't have liked me,\" she laughs. \"She hated when people were boring.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>I</strong>t is nine o'clock on a Saturday night and I should be at an old friend's party. There are likely to be nice people there, artistic, talented; and the hostess is a wizard cook. It was seven for seven thirty, dress smart but \"not too smart\"...</p> <p>I am not at the party however. Nor is my dress remotely smart, consisting as it does of a fisherman's sweater, more holes than wool, and a pair of frayed tracksuit pants smelling faintly of urine. This is my usual garb \u2013 my uniform, if you will \u2013 when I visit my betting shop of choice in north London.</p> <p>There is one other punter in the place \u2013 a nicotine-stained old guy in a raincoat who is operating a strange roulette system consisting of a plethora of tiny stakes that more or less cancel each another out.</p> <p>I used to watch small-scale punters like this with contempt. I've always been a big-bet man myself, usually staking the maximum allowable sum in all the major chains (\u00a3100) on my preferred game \u2013 blackjack. Then one day I found myself in a Ladbrokes shop on a Saturday afternoon with every station occupied. I waited a quarter of an hour for a seat to come vacant. It was then that I realised that the size of the bet didn't count for anything: I was just as desperate and sleazy as the rest of them.</p> <p>That convinced me of the true nature of my predicament, though sadly it didn't do anything to curtail it. So I would find myself, at 9.50am, hovering on the threshold of William Hill in South End Green, waiting for the joint to open. Hard to retain much self-respect after that. No less pitiful, you might say, than an alcoholic outside the off licence at 9.50am on a winter morning, slapping his cirrhotic sides against the cold.</p> <p>After wishing my confrere an unacknowledged \"Good luck\", I make my way to a terminal and park my backside on the sticky black leather seat.</p> <p>I've gambled online, and in live casinos, but neither has the same, uniquely sordid appeal as the betting shop. It's the tackiness of the betting shop that, for me, puts it without peer as a means of wrecking your life. And among the charms of the betting shop, blackjack has the greatest appeal.</p> <p>This has something to do, I assume, with the structure of the game: the ability to stand or take another card creates an irresistible illusion of control. With roulette, you spin the wheel, and that's it; horses: once they're off, ditto. Whereas with blackjack, few things can match the adrenaline rush you get when that third card takes you to 20 or, incredibly, to 21.</p> <p>If you're not familiar with gaming machines, they are, in appearance and construction, not unlike the automatic ticket vendors at railway stations. Though, in this case, in return for the money you feed in, you mostly get nothing back.</p> <p>The soulless strip lighting of the shop creates a curiously appealing, dismal ambience \u2013 a kind of physical equivalent to my own spiritual landscape. I'm starting to think the north London artistes I ought to be rubbing shoulders with at this moment don't know what they're missing as they chew on their boeuf bourguignon and mashed potato canap\u00e9s and sip Rioja. So, why am I here? Well, clearly because I'm a schmuck, but that's not what I mean; I mean biographically speaking \u2026</p> <p>For many years an old friend of mine and I have been devotees of poker. It began with evenings of spontaneous, anarchic, life-enhancing mayhem at his flat, escalating from there, by insidious steps, into a serious fortnightly home game complete with league table and annual trophy. Now, if all poker \u2013 all gambling games, in fact \u2013 are potentially addictive and obsessional, Texas Holdem is both of those things to the power of 10.</p> <p>Being endowed with just the right, catastrophic psychic make-up, I was pretty soon hooked. One day in February 2005 I asked the old pal in question if there was anywhere you could play Holdem online. He chortled and gave me the name of a \"reputable\" site. That night I opened an account and began to play.</p> <p>I started in a restrained way \u2013 five or six hours a day \u2013 maybe a bit more if I had no work on. Soon I was convinced I'd struck gold. Here, at last, was the steady, reliable source of income I'd been dreaming of ever since giving up a well-paid job in the City to concentrate on, of all things, translating 17th-century French verse comedies.</p> <p>I couldn't keep this goldmine I'd hit on to myself. I announced arrogantly at dinner parties that I had discovered a new string to my bow, a sure-fire revenue stream. The \"fish\" (poker speak for bad players) out there had to be seen to be believed. I even managed to convince myself that I was earning a living from the game. It took many weeks of steady, daily losses before a nagging suspicion was born that something might be amiss. A subsequent check of bank and credit card statements revealed a \u00a34,000 net loss in a matter of weeks. How?</p> <p>I was an addict by now, of course, and that kind of self-delusion is standard addict practice. Worse still, because of the peculiar nature of gambling addiction \u2013 many experts reckon it's the hardest of all addictions to cure \u2013 once it dawned on me that I was in fact losing, I figured the only way to recoup the money was to play more and then yet more.</p> <p>One time, after playing non-stop for three days, so that the index finger of my right hand had started to tingle from repeatedly clicking the mouse to bet on or fold a hand, I woke to find that somebody had broken into my flat during the night and festooned it with playing cards. They were all over the walls, they were dangling from the curtains. Wherever I went \u2013 bathroom to wash, kitchen to make breakfast \u2013 they kept popping up.</p> <p>I dismissed this (despite having once suffered from a bout of manic depression that included delusions) as some sort of short-term optical glitch that was only to be expected in the circumstances, and soon hurried back to my laptop to resume playing.</p> <p>Then, around lunchtime, I was in the loo, when I looked down and saw that there was a playing card lying in the bottom of the bowl. This was no vague optical effect, either, but a perfectly formed, shiny new king of hearts.</p> <p>I called my GP, fixed an emergency appointment and got myself straight down there. \"You're mad,\" she said, perhaps more accurately than she'd intended, when I had described the situation. \"You have a history of mental problems. You should not be doing this. Go home, switch off your computer, or better still, chuck it in the bin and take this pill and get some sleep.\"</p> <p>She placed a large white tablet in my hand. Feeling a whole lot better, I reckoned I would just get a couple more hours' play in, take the tablet and turn in. Unfortunately, I drifted off in the middle of a hand, without having taken the pill, and when I woke up a couple of hours later I was dying...</p> <p>Well, perhaps not quite. In the ambulance they informed me that I was having a massive atrial fibrillation, brought on by four days and nights without sleep, sprayed something on the roof of my mouth, and asked for my next of kin. On reaching A&amp;E I was attended to with worrying promptness and a drip was inserted in my neck. I was in there all the next day, my pulse returning to normal just 20 minutes before I was scheduled to be medically \"rebooted\".</p> <p>All this makes gambling seem a dark and destructive business, and, of course, it can be. But that's pretty obviously not the whole story. Like all addictive activities, it offers astonishing highs \u2013 highs as high as the lows are low. If it didn't, who on earth would take it up in the first place? During a lucky streak, for instance, I get a sense of quite astonishing and implausibly sustained wellbeing. There was the time, to cite one of many, when I turned my last \u00a32,000 in the world into \u00a382,000 over a spell of about three weeks. (The fact that I went on to blow the lot in 10 minutes and was suicidal for a fortnight thereafter is another matter.) Regaining a recent loss brings a special pleasure of its own, as any gambler will tell you: a weird, warped sense of redemption.</p> <p>Equally true, on the other hand, is an observation by Casanova, who had a sideline in gambling and noted that inside every serious gambler lurks a miser. Or, to put it another way, a greedy klutz wanting something for nothing.</p> <p>But, yes, the highs. Perhaps even more exhilarating than that 80 grand streak was the day when I had gambled everything away except a \u00a35,000 overdraft facility. By this stage I had had to remortgage my flat to the tune of \u00a320,000. I spent the day debating with myself whether or not I should try my luck and see what I could do with that 5k. What had I got to lose? It wasn't even my money, but the bank's.</p> <p>As usual, the inner demons (the shrinks, the addiction experts, call it this \"permission thought\") won the argument, and at midnight, came the start of a new 24-hour period, which meant that I was allowed to deposit fresh funds. I transferred the overdraft money to my William Hill account and sat down to a hand of blackjack, staking the maximum allowable amount on one hand of \u00a35,000.</p> <p>I hit 20 with that hand, won, 20 with the next, won again, won again with the third bet. In the space of two minutes I had not merely quadrupled my 5k overdraft, but could now pay off my mortgage and be, once more, to some degree at least, a free man.</p> <p>I collapsed on the sofa, numb with joy, sandbagged by bliss. But the demons were of the opinion that I shouldn't stop there. In their judgment this was clearly a streak, and there was at least one more win out there \u2013 possibly even blackjack, which pays 150%. I went back to my laptop, put another 5k on and hit blackjack. In 10 minutes, from four consecutive hands, I had made \u00a322,500, and changed my life. I remember sitting in the dark for half an hour with such joy and relief washing over me.</p> <p>But, for the MOST PART, the order of the day has, inevitably, been self-destruction. I have lost, at a conservative estimate, a quarter of a million pounds over the past seven years. And I am once again remortgaged, for 30k this time.</p> <p>I do not complain about any of this \u2013 not the debt, the near-death experience, not even the huge and horribly dark spells of despair and self-loathing. Nor am I especially plagued when I remember that, but for gambling, I would now be living on a comfortable income from royalties scrimped and saved over 15 years of hard showbiz slog.</p> <p>There is nothing worse in this world than a sore loser, and nowhere is that more true than in gambling. The tax revenues from the big gaming companies help build schools and hospitals, pay for teachers, doctors and nurses. This is something, I tell myself.</p> <p>I do sometimes wonder quietly why walking down any major street in London has to be, for me and my fellow gambling addicts, rather like negotiating Scylla and Charybdis \u2013 Paddy Power or Betfred here, William Hill or Ladbrokes there. But the resentment doesn't last. I have swallowed my pride, sought professional help, attended GA meetings. At the time of writing I haven't gambled, in any shape or form, for several months.</p> <p>The other day, for instance, as I approached Finchley Road, near where I live \u2013 a thoroughfare positively festooned with betting shops \u2013 I conceived a strong urge to have a flutter on the betting machines. What harm could it do, now that I was cured? I found myself walking, like a zombie, towards the nearest of the outlets. I must have forgotten the time I once lost \u00a36,000 trying to win \u00a32 to cover the cost of a piece of broccoli I'd deemed overpriced.</p> <p>Suddenly, like young Stephen Dedalus in <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>, as he walks down Lott's Lane in search of stimulus, then suddenly spins round and heads for home, I turned. The pull on me as I headed back toward the bus stop, and home, was astonishingly powerful. The feeling of triumph as I boarded a bus and headed for Hampstead (where any betting shop manager worth his salt will, at my own request, eject me from the premises on sight) was one that, to anybody who hasn't been there, might seem pathetic.</p> <p>The gambler in me is still looking to recoup, needless to say. But now he does it in different ways. It's a truism to say that no very disastrous experience is without its compensatory positives \u2013 its winnings, in other words. What I have gained from gambling is twofold. Firstly, there is a much-needed sense of one's own fallibility that I suspect was lacking in me before the debacle began. Secondly, and perhaps more usefully, I have acquired a measure of immunity to disaster.</p> <p>Misfortune of sundry kinds, and especially financial, can easily be put into perspective by the mere recollection of the mayhem one has been through. That is a perhaps not inconsiderable boon in these days of, for many of us, unwonted austerity and ongoing financial uncertainty. I am, if you like, a mini Greece, only a stop or two ahead, with a viable reconstruction package already in place, and working. Whether this is all bunkum, and I turn out to be another De Quincy \u2013 bragging about how he'd beaten his addiction to opium when he was taking the stuff till the day he died \u2013 only time will tell.</p> <p><em>Ranjit Bolt's </em>Cyrano de Bergerac <em>opens at the Roundabout Theatre in New York on 11 October</em></p>",
  "<p>Kevin Marsh was a quintessential BBC man \u2013 an earnest professional with a tendency to worry. As editor of Radio&#xa0;4's <em>World at One </em>he had applied his forensic skills to its political coverage. He seemed the natural choice to succeed Rod Liddle at the <em>Today </em>programme.</p> <p>That is where the tragedy, and this tale, begin. Marsh inherited Liddle's team, including Andrew Gilligan. On 29 May 2003, the former <em>Telegraph </em>loner broadcast his fateful two-way interview about an order from Downing Street that the briefing paper on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction be \"sexed-up\". Eight months later, with the scientist Dr David Kelly dead, Lord Hutton issued his report on the affair. It led to the dismembering of the BBC senior management and astonishing exoneration of the government.</p> <p>Every time I think about that tawdry episode my blood boils, not so much for the so-called victims at the corporation but for what it did for the Beeb's spine. An organisation which has risk aversion built into its DNA spent years afterwards frightened stiff of antagonising authority. It has recovered many of its best values since, but in the \"compliance\" forms, the perpetual reviews by the Trust and the general fretting, vestiges of that fear remain.</p> <p>Here I declare an interest. I was seconded to Liddle's <em>Today </em>for a year, well before this saga, and saw some of the workings, good and bad, close at hand. Second, Marsh and I had a mini ding-dong, an episode that he recalls in the conclusion of this book. As editor of the <em>New Statesman</em>, I wrote a cover story in 2005 on the BBC and the Hutton effect. Playing on the acronym, I chose the headline \"Broken, Beaten, Cowed\". Marsh bridled, suggesting that the only journalism I respect is the type that annoys the powerful. He's half right. I see little point in entering the trade to become a stenographer. There should be no conflict between courage and checking your facts.</p> <p>Marsh was a stickler for accuracy and yet he was caught out by some basic errors. If his team knew in advance that Gilligan's reports were so potentially combustible, why was his first \"two-way\" at the lesser slot of just after 6am and not 6.30? In BBC-land that is important. Why, more crucially, was he allowed to do his \"live\" from a remote feed, and not from the studio, where he could be carefully supervised?</p> <p>Bizarrely, Marsh complains that he was never allowed to give his version of events at the Hutton inquiry. If his requests to appear were refused by pen pushers why didn't he cause a stink? There's little point in complaining of victimhood after the event.</p> <p>Nobody comes out of this story well, particularly the then governors who offered up their chairman and director general as sacrifices and then undertook a ridiculous version of the Spanish inquisition to satisfy a vengeful government.</p> <p>Even if I disagree with some of his interpretations, Marsh provides an important contribution to the narrative surrounding Iraq and media coverage. Several fascinating tales are told. My favourite is his account of a lunch at MI6 to which Marsh and <em>Today</em>'s star presenter John Humphrys were invited. \"On any Cartesian analysis, Iraq was not the main threat,\" Sir Richard Dearlove, the head of MI6, told them.</p> <p>We know what happened. Blair had given President Bush his support back in the summer of 2002. He needed to build the case, come what may. His officials and spinners did the necessaries. Marsh reminds readers how, long before the war, the government would stop at nothing to control the news agenda. On one occasion, in order to drive Robin Cook's marital crisis off the bulletin, Downing Street put pressure on the BBC's political team to run a flaky story about the (Conservative) governor of Hong Kong supposedly giving state secrets away. The object of their manipulations was Chris Patten, now chairman of the BBC Trust. I assume he hasn't forgotten.</p>",
  "<p>On the North Road that cuts through the east Manchester district of Clayton, a police car can be seen scouting a red-brick boxing gym every 15 minutes. Its regular appearance has been carefully calibrated, part of the huge police operation designed to stymie further bloodshed following the killing of two female police officers in the city.</p> <p>The Northside Amateur Boxing Club, frequented by the Short family, is among a list of places identified by police as vulnerable to reprisal attacks in a feud between gangs that has shocked the country.</p> <p>Parts of Greater Manchester are effectively in lockdown. Many residents are convinced that the gangland feud said to have seen Dale Cregan, 29, charged with the murder of constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, is far from over. Cregan is also charged with the murder of Mark Short, 23, and his father David, 46, and the attempted murder of another family member.</p> <p>Joe Pennington, who has been running the club for 20 years, said: \"It's pretty tense. People are worried about backlashes, looking around at cars passing the gym and so on.\"</p> <p>The gym, in the heart of Clayton and used by many affiliates of the Short family, only reopened on Monday 16 September after weeks spent shut following police warnings about the risk of attack.</p> <p>The following day, on the outskirts of Hattersley estate, seven miles south-east of the Northside club, Bone and Hughes were killed in a gun and grenade attack that reopened the debate on arming officers, raised levels of community distrust towards police and saw David Cameron visit the city to express his \"profound shock\".</p> <p>But for the population of east Manchester, it is what happens next that will be crucial. Police say a number of grenades remain possibly unaccounted for.</p> <p>For now, Pennington says that the Short family are keeping a low profile: \"They'll be watching out \u2013 anything could happen. We'll have to wait and see. Not seen many around. David has not even been buried yet.\"</p> <p>Yet Greater Manchester police, trying to restore order while grieving over its own darkest day, continues to issue scores of \"Osman\" warnings \u2013 official notices sent to members of the public explaining that officers have obtained credible intelligence that they are at \"high risk of murder\".</p> <p>In Hattersley, scene of last week's police double killing, residents are apprehensive. The consensus among many is that peace will prevail as long as large numbers of police are camped on its streets \u2013 but what might occur, they ask, when they leave? \"There are a lot of people checking their backs. Everybody is anxious about what happens when the police go,\" said one resident in his 40s who did not want to be identified.</p> <p>Many on the estate are defensive when asked about the police killings. No one wants to give their names. Long before darkness, the streets of Hattersley are disquietingly empty. Locals say the violence has transformed the estate into a ghost town, with many lying low \"for various reasons\". One teenager said: \"It's gone proper quiet, never seen it like this. Maybe police have scared them off.\"</p> <p>While Cregan was on the run, he reportedly stayed on this overspill estate. Despite Greater Manchester police's biggest manhunt and the offer of a \u00a350,000 reward, some residents claim he had been seen on the estate's wide streets. The lack of information prompted the GMP's chief constable, Peter Fahy, to lament the \"conspiracy of silence\" that had protected Cregan.</p> <p>Some suggest that the community was not harbouring a wanted man, but merely protecting itself, fearing that the repercussions of \"grassing\" were greater than not telling the police. Yet many on the estate are adamant that they would have known had Cregan been hiding there and would have had no qualms about notifying the police.</p> <p>Kieran Quinn, leader of Tameside council, said it would have been impossible for Cregan to have hidden undetected in Hattersley: \"If one person had known for one second that Cregan was there, they would have contacted the police. This veil of silence is simply a veil of ignorance: the community had no knowledge. This is a strong, well-connected community that cares for itself and looks after its neighbours. They have been absolutely taken aback that this should happen in their peaceful area.\"</p> <p>His claims are corroborated by council sources who allege they have been told by police that Cregan turned up on the estate only a short time before the murders. \"The information they have is that he had only just arrived. He's a guy who has been on the run, hiding away in rat holes all over the place.\"</p> <p>Inside the estate's community centre \u2013 next to a neighbourhood police station plastered with posters promoting Greater Manchester's lauded gun crime unit, Xcalibre Task Force \u2013 workers maintain that no one knew Cregan was in town.</p> <p>Instead, they claim Hattersley has been unfairly vilified in the past week. Quinn recounts how one television crew asked curious youths at the crime scene to zip up their hoodies pre-interview and of faithfully reporting claims by \"young bucks saying 'Yeah I saw him', in order to show off\". Claims that criminals coming out of prison are treated like kings on their return to the estate are rubbished by everyone.</p> <p>But others are quick to identify distrust of the police as a real issue, among them one of Britain's most eminent criminologists who last Thursday visited the estate. David Wilson, professor of criminology and criminal justice at Birmingham City University, said the 2,800-home estate below the foothills of the Pennines appeared indicative of a failed, post-industrial \"hollowed-out society\".</p> <p>Wilson said a vacuum of jobs and amenities on such estates created a disillusion with the authorities among youngsters that was readily exploited by organised criminals who could offer them a purpose and structure. He said: \"When the traditional social and economic infrastructure that dominates most communities and provides organisation \u2013 banks, churches, factories, workplaces \u2013 disappears, people still want order to their lives.\"</p> <p>He said in places where the police were perceived as ineffective or had a low profile, young men in particular gravitated towards an alternative justice system.</p> <p>\"If communities never really see the police, or they appear ineffectual, they will turn to others they see more regularly and who they think will deliver results.\" In such cases, says Wilson, officers are derided as \"metaphors\" of a state they believe has neglected them. Cregan was quickly celebrated by some as a hero prepared to stand against the authorities.</p> <p>But antipathy towards the police spreads wider than just Hattersley, with last year's rioting in Greater Manchester's city centre, 10 miles away, partly blamed on distrust of the authorities. On Thursday, as Fahy laid flowers at the spot where two of his officers were killed in the line of duty, reports emerged of an incident in Wythenshawe, south Manchester, of a man severely beaten by youths because his German shepherd dog was the breed used by police.</p> <p>For Fahy, the events of last week might also reaffirm the changing nature of Greater Manchester's gun crime map. Previously his resources were concentrated upon the \"triangle of death\" encompassing inner-city Moss Side and Longsight to the south of the centre, with its armed, primarily black, gangs battling over drugs territory. The current feud resembles those between \"old school\" crime families from white working-class communities whose rivalry originally stemmed from parochialism but became personal.</p> <p>Pennington, raised on the streets of Clayton, will spend the weekend hoping a fragile peace will hold and that Greater Manchester's east side does not descend into the internecine gun war that engulfed the south of the city two decades ago. He said: \"There's always been little bits of beef [between Droylsden and Clayton] but this is well over the top.\"</p>",
  "<p>'We heard a rumour that Norwegian explorers were contemplating this,\" the professional adventurer <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19609293\" title=\"\">Sir Ranulph Fiennes</a> said last week, as he announced some insane outing across the Antarctic involving complicated training and a caravan of bulldozers, huts and fuel. \"We realised we were going to have to have a go.\"</p> <p>Pressed on his motives, the 68-year-old Sir Ranulph, who has survived a heart bypass as well as the loss of various digits on previous expeditions, seemed to accept that British-Norwegian rivalry was not the most compelling pretext for his winter expedition to a fully mapped region that has, in any case, been crossed in summer.</p> <p>\"It's what I do,\" he said, adding, as if it was the worst that could conceivably be said of a mountain: \"Everybody's grandmother goes up Mount Everest at the weekend.\" Much was made of the hideous conditions he and his men would \"brave\", so long as they did it at the most disagreeable time of year, and virtually nothing of his decision to leave behind a six-year-old daughter for the sake of an escapade that would not attract attention if it did not threaten to finish him off.</p> <p>You gather that, for all the advances in paternal involvement, attitudes towards mothers and fathers who leave their children in order to do pointless and life-threatening things have changed little since the mountaineer Alison Hargreaves died on K2 in 1995, leaving two small children. She was widely accused of being a neglectful mother. Bonkers father of one Sir Ranulph, however, remains the beau ideal of <em>The</em> <em>Dangerous Book for Boys</em>, a manual much prized by Michael Gove, and of the kind of online commenter who praised him last week for his \"balls of steel\". Indeed, lavish media approval of a scheme so fabulously harebrained as Fiennes's can't but suggest continued respect for a version of masculinity that will always reject domesticity and grandmothers in favour of all-male challenges in the Antarctic, or at the golf club, or, failing that, at the House of Commons. In Parliament, we have again been reminded, balls of steel are cherished as keenly as they were when Prescott confessed: \"I thumped a bloke\" and Blair invoked Brown's \"big clunking fist\".</p> <p>To judge by recent weeks, British politics remains utterly committed to displays of what a new Samaritans report \u2013<a href=\"http://www.samaritans.org/media-centre/our-campaigns/were-your-corner/were-your-corner-research\" title=\"\"> \"Men, Suicide and Society\"</a> \u2013 calls \"hegemonic masculinity\", or the kind of male behaviour that remains most highly prized. In general, it explains, \"hegemonic masculinity is characterised by attributes such as: striving for power and dominance, aggressiveness, courage, independency, efficiency, rationality, competitiveness, success, activity, control and invulnerability; not perceiving or admitting anxiety, problems and burdens; and withstanding danger, difficulties and threats\". Step forward, by way of example, Andrew \"Thrasher\" Mitchell, last seen abusing and harassing policemen as they did their job, and compromising his own, notionally that of Conservative chief whip. Prior to this engagement, our public servant was mainly noted for his schoolboy enthusiasm for corporal punishment, hence \"Thrasher\".</p> <p>While this clown's latest assertion of his alpha-maleness, in debased imitation of Bertram Wooster's misadventures, will undoubtedly add to female consternation about a Drones Club government whose leader insults women and twits his rival for being insufficiently \"macho\", Mitchell's contribution to the public understanding of hegemonic masculinity also deserves a mention. The interfering policemen were insulted as \"plebs\", who had \"best learn your fucking place\".</p> <p>In one arrogant, de haut en bas encounter, presumably not unique, Mitchell neatly illustrates what the Samaritans make clear in their unsettling paper: that men, as well as women, suffer the consequences of unreconstructed masculinity.</p> <p>Whether witnessed close-up, as in Mitchell's case, or from afar, in the exaltation of Sir Ranulph as he escorts his wig to the Antarctic, a narrow model of male prowess is actively damaging huge numbers of non-dominant, powerless or jobless men, who struggle, the charity explains, when they are unable to meet expectations. Summarising their research, undertaken after the discovery that middle-aged rather than young men are now the highest risk group for suicide, and three times more likely to kill themselves than women, the authors assert: \"Masculinity \u2013 the way men are brought up to behave and the roles, attributes and behaviours that society expects of them \u2013 contributes to suicide in men.\"</p> <p>Their many recommendations include a wish that fathers be invested and acknowledged in their children's lives in a way that goes beyond the conventional model of provider. Not all fathers, after all, want to live like Sir Ranulph. In fact, while Thrasher was tearing the wings off flies last week, a less-well known Conservative MP, Tim Loughton, told <em>Woman's Hour</em> that the lack of time with their children is \"a hidden problem among men\", who still don't feel, unlike women MPs, able to discuss the issue.</p> <p>Tim Loughton, at least, extracts what the Samaritans call a \"patriarchal dividend\" from his MP status. The risk of male suicide is highest among disadvantaged men or, to use the political jargon, plebians. \"As you go down each rung of the social ladder, the risk of suicide increases.\" Although the impact of the current recession on women's jobs has probably had more attention, more men are unemployed, a fact not unconnected with some men's inhibitions, again because of conventional notions about manliness, about doing \"women's jobs\".</p> <p>Once a man becomes unemployed, even if he has family responsibilities, a society built on Thrasher principles does not show him the respect it does to female full-time carers who have lost their jobs. Why would that change, anyway, when in the time it has taken Naomi Wolf, alone, to write seven books, and in which there have been approximately 10,000 articles deploring the prevalence of pink, the literature exploring masculinity has barely advanced since Neil Lyndon wrote <em>No More Sex War</em> in 1992, with a sincerity about this outcome that could perhaps be surmised from his subtitle: The Failures of Feminism?</p> <p>By the end of the century, he predicted, \"the harridans who have been so proud of their spite will be trilling denials at their dinner tables\".</p> <p>As it is, just as the imminent arrival of Hanna Rosin's new book, <em>The End of Men</em>, may struggle to shift the impression that hegemonic masculinity still looks to be in rude health, it could be tricky for a man to challenge the Thrasher version of maleness without eliciting a reflexive diddums. Long before his embarrassing apology, the derision and invitations to \"grow a pair\" that greeted Nick Clegg's admission of emotional responses to music and literature, indicated \u2013 along with speculation about his controlling wife \u2013 limited interest in challenging the inflexible \"big beast\" and \"bruiser\" orthodoxies of political success.</p> <p>Women, in this respect, escape lightly. It is certainly hard to admire an oik or an Ed Balls, hegemonically acting out on the frontbenches \u2013 but at least no one expects you to imitate them.</p>",
  "<p>The first thought to strike anyone stumbling upon the now-infamous <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> video on YouTube without knowing anything about it would probably be that it makes Monty Python's <em>The Life of Brian</em> look like the work of Merchant Ivory. It's daft, amateurish beyond belief and, well, totally weird. So the notion that such a fatuous production might provoke carnage in distant parts of the world seems preposterous.</p> <p>And yet it did. In the process, the video created numerous headaches for a US administration struggling to deal with the most turbulent part of the world. But it also raised some tricky questions about the role that commercial companies play in regulating free speech in a networked world \u2013 questions that will remain long after <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> has been forgotten.</p> <p>European commentators have smugly observed that the kerfuffle shows how little the Arab world understands the idea of free speech. Actually, what it shows is the gulf that separates the US from the rest of the world, including Europe. If the video had surfaced on a hosting site based in the UK, for example, it would have been taken down for incitement to religious hatred.</p> <p>But the first amendment to the US constitution provides a different kind of legal environment. The Obama administration was therefore not in a position to ban the video so it took the route of trying to persuade Google, YouTube's owner, that it violated YouTube's rules. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/world/middleeast/google-wont-rethink-anti-islam-videos-status.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Google declined</a> the request 10 days ago, saying that the video did not violate its terms of service regarding hate speech. The video would remain online because it was against the Islam religion but not Muslim people.</p> <p>So far, so good. But then Google appeared to undermine its own argument by announcing that it had blocked access to the video in some countries. Access was denied in India and Indonesia because it violated local laws in those jurisdictions, but it was also blocked in Egypt and Libya\u201a not because it violated their laws but because of \"the delicacy of the situation\".</p> <p>At this point, even those who are not constitutional lawyers begin to smell a rat. Here we have a commercial company effectively making editorial judgments. If Google were a publisher, like, say, the <em>New York Times</em>, then the question of whether it should or should not publish the video could be trashed out via an established channel \u2013 the courts. But Google is not a publisher: it's something else entirely \u2013 an <em>intermediary</em> \u2013 a type of entity that's increasingly common nowadays and includes Facebook, Twitter and, oddly enough, Amazon.</p> <p>So we're now in new and uncharted territory, nicely described by one legal scholar, Eoin O'Dell, on <a href=\"http://www.cearta.ie/2012/09/youtube-facebook-and-the-responsibilities-of-intermediary-gatekeepers/\" title=\"\">his blog</a>: \"First, in the online world, where most of us access the internet through a range of intermediaries, government censorship does not necessarily need to target the disfavoured speech; it need only target the intermediaries. Very few US companies would feel able to decline a request like that from the White House, and Google are to be commended for standing firm in those circumstances. Second, these intermediaries now have a great deal of practical power over online expression\u201a not only can they be co-opted by government as agents of state censorship but they also have the capacity to act as censors in their own rights, as Google did in their unilateral action to block access in the Middle&#xa0;East.\"</p> <p>Oddly enough, this issue surfaced first in relation to Amazon, which most people think of only as a retailer, but which also provides cloud-computing services that make it an intermediary. During the \"Cablegate\" controversy, when WikiLeaks came under sustained cyber-attack, the site was moved to Amazon's EC2 cloud service on the grounds that the company's infrastructure could withstand any level of attack. But the relief offered was temporary because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-website-cables-servers-amazon\" title=\"\">Amazon summarily ejected WikiLeaks</a> from its servers following outraged statements by some US politicians, notably Senator Joe Lieberman and vice-president Biden. Amazon claimed that it had ejected WikiLeaks simply because it was violating its service's terms and conditions.</p> <p>Oh yeah? The Obama administration knew that a direct order to Amazon would not have survived a First Amendment challenge. But they guessed that the same effect could be achieved through a public statement by an official, executed by \"voluntary\" action of a private company.</p> <p>What this means, as the legal scholar Yochai Benkler <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/02/22/harvard-law-prof-amazons-wikileaks-shutdown-set-dangerous-precedent/\" title=\"\">has pointed out</a>, is that the safeguards to free speech ensured by the first amendment to the US constitution might not count for much in a public sphere built entirely of privately owned infrastructure.</p> <p>Facebook \u2013 or YouTube, for that matter \u2013 may look like public spaces but when it comes to the crunch they offer no more freedom of speech than the average shopping mall.</p>",
  "<p>One of the heroes of Rushdie's memoir is a handsome, tennis-playing, gun-carrying police protection officer called Stan, which may or may not be his real name. His first reaction to the fatwa was simple. \"It can't be allowed\u2026 threatening a British citizen. It's not on. It'll get sorted.\" As we know, it took years to sort and arguments against the dying ayatollah's death sentence span out of control into impassioned and often intemperate debates about the blasphemy laws, freedom of speech, the nature of fiction, cultural relativism, Islam, the narrowing of national identities and the alleged cost to the British nation of Stan, his colleagues and Operation Malachite. Rushdie's bold, complex and literary novel, <em>The Satanic Verses</em>, was hijacked by the exterminating angels of wrath, a wrath that still flames around us. Some were killed, many were threatened. It&#xa0;continues.</p> <p>Rushdie has now told his version of events and it is more gripping than any spy story. Having resisted commercial attempts to fictionalise his life, he has attempted to tell his own truth. It cannot have been easy. He kept a journal, but, being a clever and would-be honest man, he knows we deceive and bowdlerise even in our journals and admits it. Doris Lessing urged him to tell the whole truth, like Rousseau, but he failed, as she did.</p> <p>For his double life, he was obliged to turn himself into a fictional character and he became Joseph Anton, after Conrad and Chekhov. The former he describes as \"the trans-lingual creator of wanderers\u2026 of secret agents in a world of killers and bombs, and of at least one immortal coward, hiding from his shame\". The reference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/classics/9780007449859/lord-jim\" title=\"\"><em>Lord Jim</em></a> (which could also apply to Razumov, in Conrad's novel of anarchy and terrorism, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/classics/9780199552375/under-western-eyes\" title=\"\"><em>Under Western Eyes</em></a>) is suggestive and Rushdie (an authority on Shame) is not afraid to show himself as a coward and a clown, hiding from a sheep farmer behind a kitchen dresser in Wales, shutting himself into bathrooms in north London to avoid a plumber or a cleaner. He turns himself into an almost Falstaffian figure, shabby and overweight, letting himself go, smoking, at times drinking too much and quarrelling with a succession of wives.</p> <p>The surviving wives cannot have looked forward with pleasure to this publication, which tells us more perhaps than we need to know. The disclosures make for powerful reading, but the device of writing in the third person does little to distance the domestic rows about matters great and small \u2013 infidelity, video games, pregnancies, fertility, security. They are all too close, all too present. It is a tragicomic account of a life lived under great pressure, where Rushdie's self-confessed \"need to be loved\" led him to make disastrous mistakes. Wife after wife told him she did not like living under his shadow. Maybe they, too, can now walk free.</p> <p>Others won't like what they read here. Rushdie has seized the opportunity to settle scores with many of those who, he felt, let him down or abused him. Like most writers, he never forgets a bad review. His foes range bizarrely from outspoken fatwa supporters including the Muslim convert \"Stupid\" Cat Stevens, the unforgivable (Sir) <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4081208.stm\" title=\"\">Iqbal Sacranie</a> of the Muslim Council of Britain and the \"garden gnome\" Kalim Siddiqui of the Muslim Institute, to writers Roald Dahl (\"a long unpleasant man with huge strangler's hands\"), Arundhati Roy and Louis de Berni\u00e8res, who had variously criticised him, crossed him or bored him. Broadcaster Mark Lawson is ticked off for having endorsed the view that he was \"pompous\" and for having complained that Rushdie once hijacked his taxi. MP Keith Vaz and literary journalist <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/james_wood/search?contributorName=james%20wood\" title=\"\">James Wood</a> emerge as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vicar_of_Bray\" title=\"\">Vicars of Bray</a>, the first for having supported then rejected the fatwa, the second for having altered the content of a review of a Rushdie novel between the UK and the US to please his US \"paymasters\".</p> <p>As gossip, this is very entertaining, though not always very edifying. There is also, in the second half of the book, too much about who won or didn't win the Booker prize: too many prizes and speeches, too much of internecine literary politics. In the orbit of the charismatic Bill Clinton, both Rushdie's entourage and his prose seem to wander a bit off track. Rushdie, as he knows, is far from immune to glamour and celebrity. An invisible man in hiding, he longed for the limelight and for public recognition&#xa0;of&#xa0;his work. Other less party-going writers could have disappeared more easily.</p> <p>This memoir, like the novel it might have been, is full both of telling trivia and profound insights. The sections that describe Rushdie's family background, the death of his father and his schooldays are excellent. It is at once a personal history, an account of a butterfly's wing called <em>The Satanic Verses</em> and an analysis of the catastrophic chaos that the flapping of those pages unleashed. Rushdie appears to take a gloomy view about the chaos: true, his book was published, he and his family survived, his nation and his publishers were on the whole loyal to him, but the world is now a less safe place and the dream of an opened universe where we are allowed broad-based identities seems further off than ever. His book, as he puts it, was but the prologue and we are still grappling with the \"main event\". Some will blame him for the hubris of this statement and they will be the same people who blame him for his failures to apologise. He can't know, we can't know, what would have happened if he hadn't published that novel, if the old imam on his deathbed hadn't issued a fatwa against the author of a book he had never read. Walter Benjamin's angel of history looks backward and sees destruction, but can never see what might have been.</p> <p>As it happens, I spent my 50th birthday, on 5 June 1989, with Salman at our house at Porlock Weir, where he and his then wife, Marianne, had been staying for some weeks. It was two days after the ayatollah's death and a day after Tiananmen Square. As he recounts, the Holroyds and the Rushdies spent the evening \"half celebratory, half shocked by history\", watching on TV the immense crowd flailing around the bier. Salman (or perhaps Stan) had bought me a chocolate egg in Minehead.</p> <p>In our absence, he and Special Branch had been unable to get to grips with the problem of the ever-flashing oven clock and had covered it with a strip of Elastoplast. The answer was a ballpoint pen, but I'm not sure he was very pleased to discover the solution was so simple. There's a metaphor there, but I'm not sure what it is.</p> <p>My first reaction to the news of the fatwa was identical to Stan's. Threatening a British citizen, and in a country that had at last abolished the death penalty, was not on. I was (and remain) outraged and I was happy to help by offering the house as sanctuary. It had a good view and a man under house arrest needs a view. Like Stan, I thought the fatwa would be lifted in a matter of weeks. It wasn't.</p> <p>I would have been more than happy to offer evidence in court for the literary merit of <em>The Satanic Verses</em>, a defence Salman would have appreciated. Like Michael Foot, I had greatly admired the novel, particularly the passages about Thatcher's subversive, divided multicultural London. But this defence was never required. And, in the long run, it wasn't needed. Rushdie's work has rightly won worldwide recognition. He is a great writer and he has been brave enough to portray himself as a coward scuttling for cover and hiding behind a kitchen dresser. That takes courage, too.</p>",
  "<p>The publication of the Hillsborough independent panel's report exposes not just the shameful lies and deceit surrounding this disaster, but will remind many of the culture of institutionalised, callous contempt for those who did not belong to Thatcher's \"our people\", which Kevin Sampson tragically recalls (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/kevin-sampson-hillsborough\" title=\"\">\"I walked one way, the less fortunate walked another\"</a>, Comment). For Hillsborough was no isolated incident: the same dark arts were deployed to discredit the 51 victims of the Marchioness disaster on the Thames in August 1989, spun to the press as drugged-up, Aids-infected low life. If it had not been for the late <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/eileen-dallaglio-the-marchioness-campaigner-dies-6831091.html\" title=\"\">Eileen Dallaglio's selfless campaigning,</a> the world would never have learned of the disrespectful physical maltreatment of the bodies of the victims.</p> <p>Thatcher's home secretary, David Waddington, wasted millions of public money banning \"raves\" and sent the police out to stamp on the latest perceived threat. Freedom was breaking out all over Europe while Thatcher preached Victorian values and rammed the poll tax legislation through Parliament to seal her vision of fairness. I found the social atmosphere so poisoned by arrogance and disdain that I readily accepted a job offer in Canada and left in early 1990, thinking that I might never return. It is ironic that the belated apology in 2012 comes from a prime minister whose government demonises once again many of the weakest and most vulnerable in society in the name of deficit-cutting.</p> <p><strong>Tom Brown </strong></p> <p>London SW5</p> <p>Michael Mansfield's idea of detecting cover-ups (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/16/hillsborough-lawyer-commission-truth?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Hillsborough families' lawyer calls for permanent 'commission of truth'</a>\", News) is obvious, but is it best? Investigations after Hillsborough, Bhopal, Piper Alpha and many other disasters tragically show how easily they could have been avoided. Based on my experience in engineering, systematically applied foresight is needed, backed up by capable decision-making and defined responsibility for safety. Such measures massively reduce risks and avoid huge commercial losses; even from an amoral \"bean counting\" viewpoint, loss of life is bad for business.</p> <p>Positions of wealth and power can attract the more slippery and less vertebrate elements of humanity. As they are deft at evading blame, Mr Mansfield's suggestion is still useful, but preventing such disasters is better.</p> <p><strong>Iain Climie</strong></p> <p>Whitchurch, Hampshire</p> <p>In taking on the establishment (including the fourth estate) these past 23 years, the Hillsborough families' fight for truth and justice has done an immense service to this country and to the cause of democracy. The only real surprise for many in Liverpool is not that it took so long to wring the truth from the establishment, but the absence of anything resembling a conscience in many people who earn a living in service, apparently, to the public. The ongoing fight for \u2013 and realisation of \u2013 justice for the victims, their families and the city itself can only help change this country for the better. For (true) justice only exists between equals.</p> <p><strong>D Frederick</strong></p> <p>Liverpool</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, I returned to England after an absence of 20 years and noticed a change in both appearance and behaviour of a once efficient and admired police force. Mrs Thatcher had, during her first term of office, changed the formation of the British police, culminating in a unprecedentedly high pay scale, which attracted some individuals who were quite unsuitable for their positions. It has sadly taken the reliving of the Hillsborough tragedy to accentuate the failings of the many police officers who have been complicit in cover-ups and lies over the past 30 years. The cases of Stephen Lawrence, Jean Charles de Menezes and Ian Tomlinson are prime examples of malfeasance by the police and the challenge to the government is finally to face facts and ensure that the reformation of our current police force is put into place with immediate effect.</p> <p><strong>Mary Clarke</strong></p> <p>Seaford, East Sussex</p>",
  "<p>Loss of memory, the subject of Martinu's 1938 opera <strong>Julietta</strong>, ranks as one of art's most ancient and nightmarish preoccupations. From the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh\" title=\"\"><em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em></a>, which the Czech composer later set to music, to Dante, Chaucer, Langland, Shakespeare, Strindberg, Borges and countless others, writers have been drawn to that arctic frontier where dream and reality meet. \"Is not the past all shadow?\" asked Lord Byron, adding with chilly concision: \"A slumbering thought, is capable of years, and curdles a long life into one hour.\"</p> <p>Martinu's rarely performed opera is neither cool nor concise, sprawling over three hours with a patchy text, the composer's own, from a play by the French dramatist Georges Neveux. It waited four decades for its UK premiere, at the London Coliseum in 1978. Opera North staged the work expertly in 1997 and Jiri Behlohlavek, a fierce Martinu advocate, conducted a concert performance at the Barbican in 2009. That's more or less it. Now English National Opera has revived a production by Richard Jones, already seen in Paris and Geneva but new to London and keenly awaited.</p> <p>It is hard to fault the visual ingenuity, orchestral excellence or magnificent casting. Together, they do much to add depth to a work that, despite many momentary pleasures, leaves you undernourished. Antony McDonald's set cleverly diverts the eye: a huge, splayed accordion whose keys, buttons and bellows become part of the action and almost succeed in giving coherence to the bewilderingly disjointed text. The design also echoes the melancholy instrument itself, which sounds in the orchestra when the Man at Window (Henry Waddington), one of many amnesiac townsfolk who are central to the story, tries to invent the past. Later, this outsize squeeze-box turns into a drab Central Office of Dreams, as well as an enormous filing cabinet and a blank-eyed, Orwellian-style face \u2013 an imaginative feat.</p> <p>The plot is straightforward but enigmatic. We never know what is truth, what is fantasy. Michel, a bookseller from Paris, hears a girl singing through an open window in a seaside town. Haunted, he returns to seek her out. No one in the town knows past from present, yet somehow they manage to cling on to their own frail identities, written into the music via identifying motifs, and here helped by the hats they wear: pith helmet, trilby, fez, tam-o'-shanter. Many in the ensemble cast doubled or tripled up on roles, with Jeffery Lloyd-Roberts, Andrew Shore, Gwynne Howell, Susan Bickley and Clare Presland displaying welcome versatility and humour. The young mezzo Emilie Renard sparkled as the Little Arab.</p> <p>Sung in David Pountney's clear translation, this staging gave the opera its best possible shot. So, too, does the cast, with the radiant, bright-voiced tenor Peter Hoare excelling as the near-crazed Michel, almost constantly on stage, who eventually loses his senses too. Julia Sporsen, as Julietta, has less to do but was beguiling as well as cruel, as the text demands. Her distinctive love song, with its first three notes recurring in fragmentary fashion throughout the opera, reminds us of the folk origins this Czech composer at once embraced and rejected.</p> <p>Martinu uses many defining effects in his orchestration: muted strings with plenty of glissandi, rich, mainly tonal harmonies progressing strangely, without resolution. The so-called \"Julietta chords\", roughly speaking a plagal cadence with added notes also found in the music of Janacek, (check out the term \"Moravian cadence\" for a proper explanation) occur repeatedly, from Julietta's first appearance in Act 1. These chords, dense and dissonant and soft-textured as pillows, give Martinu his musical flavour.</p> <p>The problem, over three hours, is that both text and music lead to terminal repetition, which is not a good recipe for making a vital opera. On this large scale, and despite a long-awaited climax in Act III \u2013 all vividly played by the ENO orchestra and conducted with conviction by Edward Gardner \u2013 his music sounds etiolated. Nor is the libretto on a level with the potential scope of the ideas. Surrealism, if that comparison is to be made here, needs sharper blades. Nothing in <em>Julietta</em> matches the intense, brilliant mystery of a single Magritte image: think of the man who looks in the mirror only to see his rear view reflected. And yet \u2013 OK, this may be perverse; volte-face ahead \u2013 something tugs at the senses. Julietta, in truth a bit of test in reality, lives on and even flourishes, elusively, in the memory. Like poor Michel, I may have to go back and try to find out why.</p> <p>Last Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19618197\" title=\"\">Federico Colli</a>, the 24-year-old Italian pianist, won the Leeds international piano competition. As a prelude to its new seasons, the <strong>Hall\u00e9</strong> and its conductor, Mark Elder, had the task of accompanying all the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mtb68\" title=\"\">finalists</a> in concerto repertoire. Keeping the Leeds flame alive, the orchestra's opening concert of the year featured another Leeds winner, Korean pianist Sunwook Kim, who took the prize in 2006 aged 18. He was a poetic soloist in a daringly expansive, lyrical account of Brahms's Piano Concerto No 2.</p> <p>In contrast, Sibelius's Symphony No 2 was raw, massive, glacial, thrilling. Elder and the Hall\u00e9 have a strong track record in this repertoire. The invigorating acoustic of Bridgewater Hall made every orchestral line transparent. There were too many moments of revelation to enumerate. Here are a few: the crisp, menacing pizzicato of the double basses, the air-splintering trumpet fanfares, the thunderous brass chorales, the almost anarchic, stark woodwind, the fiery attack of the violins at the start of the last movement, the vitally resonant violas and cellos. This knockout performance will be released on the Hall\u00e9's own label early next year. Be prepared to have your ears scorched.</p>",
  "<p>In 1957 Jack Kerouac, suddenly famous as the authentic prophet of the Beat generation, wrote to Marlon Brando to ask him to star in a film adaptation of his novel <em>On the Road</em>. The instantly legendary book, written in three weeks on a single roll of paper, had just been published to contentious acclaim, and Kerouac, never a man scared to dream, had high hopes that the film could be a similar fast-forward phenomenon. He imagined himself starring in it as his questing alter ego Sal Paradise, alongside Brando, who would take the part of Dean Moriarty, the fictional version of his Benzedrine-fuelled soulmate, Neal Cassady.</p> <p>In his suitably breathless letter to Brando, Kerouac could hardly contain his excitement at the prospect: \"I'm praying that you'll buy ON THE ROAD and make a movie of it\u2026 \" he wrote. \"Don't worry about the structure, I know to compress and re-arrange the plot a bit to give a perfectly acceptable movie-type structure\u2026 I visualise the beautiful shots with the camera on the front seat of the car showing the road (day and night) unwinding into the windshield, as Sal and Dean yak\u2026 You play Dean and I'll play Sal (Warner Bros mentioned I&#xa0;play Sal) and I'll show you how Dean acts in real life\u2026 we can go visit him in Frisco, or have him come down to LA. [He's] still a real frantic cat\u2026 All I&#xa0;want out of this is to be able to establish myself and my mother a trust fund for life, so I can really go roaming around the world\u2026 to write what comes out of my head and free to feed my buddies when they're hungry\u2026 \"</p> <p>Brando never replied to Kerouac's letter, though he kept it (it sold early this year at auction for $33,600), and the movie of <em>On the Road </em>was often dreamed of but never made by the time Kerouac had drunk himself to oblivion aged 47 in 1969. A young director called Francis Ford Coppola picked up the rights, and in the subsequent 40 years at least five versions of a script were worked and reworked, and almost every up-and-coming actor with a restless soul and an eye for the horizon was linked with the mythological project \u2013 from Dennis Hopper through to Sean Penn. Though the book was the prototype of a hundred road movies and one blueprint for \"bromances\" from <em>Butch Cassidy </em>to <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>,<em> </em>it seemed ever more resistant to adaptation as the decades rolled on. Jean-Luc Godard had come close to directing it as his first Hollywood film; by the time the Brazilian director Walter Salles approached Coppola with the ambition to do it in 2007, the original travelling-light encounter with the American road was freighted with all sorts of baggage.</p> <p>In homage to that fact, before he made the film, and while production money ebbed and flowed, Salles, the director of the <em>Motorcycle Diaries of Che Guevara</em>, made a documentary about the journey Kerouac's book itself had undergone on the way to the cinema screen. One of the first things Salles did when he had finally cast his Sal and Dean was to show them this movie at a month-long total immersion \"beatnik bootcamp\" in Montreal, preparing them for the months of filming ahead. I'm sitting in a hotel in London with Salles's Sal Paradise, listening to him recount some of that history, and the surprise is that he is doing so in a thick Yorkshire accent.</p> <p>Sam Riley, who relishes the accent in question, could never be accused of ducking a challenge. His first screen role was as the ultimate doomed and cultish rock star, Ian Curtis of Joy Division, who took his own life in 1980 and whose fans had the fervour of disciples. It was Riley's mesmerising performance channelling the singer in Anton Corbijn's film <em>Control</em> that convinced Salles he could take on the even more daunting legend of Kerouac. In between times Riley had also set himself up to fail as Pinkie Brown in Graham Greene's <em>Brighton Rock</em>, a remake of the 1947 film which was the benchmark of postwar British cinema.</p> <p>\"<em>On the Road</em> is another one of those,\" Riley says in his cheerfully blunt way, as if it is his fate to play the unplayable, \"a film in which the audience has a very clear idea of who they think your character is, so you know you are asking for it. But that's the challenge. And that's why you know you don't want anyone else to do it. I auditioned for Sal Paradise early in 2009 and it seemed to go well, but I didn't hear anything for 18 months \u2013 and part of me was a bit relieved, to be honest \u2013 but then my agent called and said: 'You start filming in a few weeks' and I thought: 'Fuck, here we go\u2026 ' Walter showing us the documentary he had made didn't help much. He had footage of a lot of Coppola's casting sessions from over the years. The young Russell Crowe and Matthew McConaughey and others. Brad Pitt saying he was glad he eventually got too old to play Sal because it would have been too much pressure. I was thinking: 'Great\u2026 '\"</p> <p>At his hippy retreat Salles had Riley and Minnesota-born Garrett Hedlund, who would play Dean, meet everyone he could find who had known the original Beat double act, writers and drug casualties and people who had been around their San Francisco of the 50s. Neal Cassady's son came for a weekend. And all of these survivors looked Riley up and down. \"Obviously I was as surprised as anyone else that Walter wanted a Yorkshireman to play Jack Kerouac,\" he recalls. \"I remember the first biographer we met, a very nice gentleman whose whole life revolved around academic study of the Beats. Garrett and I greeted him at the door and he said to Garrett: 'You must be Dean.' Then looked over my shoulder and said: 'Which one is playing Kerouac?' I said: 'I am.' He said: 'You are awful tall to be Kerouac, and you don't have blue eyes.' And I started to say something else and he said: 'My God! Are you British?'\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, after a month of this, Riley and Heglund, and their co-star Kristen Stewart, who plays Dean's wild-child girlfriend, Marylou, were desperately keen to move on. Which was probably Salles's intention. Over the subsequent six months they properly took to the highway. \"Walter wanted us to be as bonded as possible. We had to wrap Kristen's stuff in the first three months so we were flying all over the place to get the right weather,\" Riley recalls. \"We went down to Patagonia for four days for the snow, and then Louisiana, 100% humidity, then Arizona, then Mexico, then Calgary, then we finished in San Francisco\u2026 \"</p> <p>I'd watched the film a couple of days before seeing Riley. That sense of ever-shifting location is its abiding character, along with the diminishing highs of drifting and home-wrecking as Sal and Dean search for their personal nirvanas in sex and drugs and writing and change. Riley and Hedlund and Stewart make a mythical threesome (sometimes in every sense), but the yearning for newness that gave the book its tone, that made it the attention-deficit bible for generations of rootless young men everywhere, is predictably tough to replicate on screen. The sadness of always chasing one last good time quickly becomes repetitive, which is part of the point. After a while only the scenery changes, though there are plenty of memorable characters along the way, notably Viggo Mortensen's William Burroughs.</p> <p>It is a testament to Riley and Heglund that Sal and Dean's complicated love for each other is likably credible throughout. It couldn't have worked had he not got on well with Hedlund, Riley says. \"It was a big ask in that way. Six months travelling together. We couldn't have grown up in more different parts of the world or come from more different backgrounds. But Garrett's not a typical young actor; he's very warm. He was already in character when I met him two years before. It was the part he was born to play, really. He's more considerate than Dean, but all the talking in mad obsessive tangents was completely him. I remember the first morning \u2013 he came in with this poem. He was like: 'I was up late last night and I've written something and I want to share it with you all.' And he read out this amazing poem. I thought: 'Bastard.' And I could see Walter looking at me thinking: 'What have you got?' I was like: 'The dog ate mine, you know... '\"</p> <p>I'm guessing that the film may have cured any vestigial wanderlust in 32-year-old Riley; it looks like the kind of job that makes you happy to get home.</p> <p>He laughs. \"It's odd. I was cured of that already by being in my band.\" In his early 20s, having left his public boarding school, Uppingham, and having been rejected by all the London drama schools, Riley fronted a band called 10,000 Things, in which his brother played bass. They threatened success for a while, playing the Reading Festival, supporting Razorlight and Babyshambles on tour, but it came to nothing in the end. It did in retrospect, though, give Riley some insight into Kerouac's vagabond spirit.</p> <p>What was the furthest they got, I wonder.</p> <p>\"We went all the way to Dundee once, which was a long way in our bus,\" he says. \"We'd bought it from Leeds council and it only had a seat at the front. We had sofas and stuff in the back, mirrored windows. We loved it. In a different town every night. It was great for a while.\"</p> <p>At school Riley had told people who asked that he would either be a rock star or an actor, \"not being cocky, only because acting and singing were the only things I could do\". It was a while coming. The first time he ever saw himself on a screen was the premiere of <em>Control</em> at Cannes five years ago. \"I was lucky it was such a beautiful film,\" he says. \"But it was very weird. I mean like hearing your own voice on an answerphone, but magnified a lot. I think I left nail marks in the arms of the seat. You just fear you are going to do something false. You are just thinking: 'Don't fuck up.' And as an actor I still don't really know exactly what I am doing most of the time.\" You wouldn't guess; his debut won him several awards, including the unofficial accolade of Mark Kermode's actor of the year, but his experience remains limited.</p> <p>He's still only properly been in four films, which makes it a bit like a high-wire act, he suggests. He is grateful for the advice of his wife, Alexandra Maria Lara, whom he met working on <em>Control</em> \u2013 she has been a star in Germany and beyond since she was 16 and was Oscar nominated for her role as Hitler's secretary in <em>Downfall</em>. They live in Berlin, which Riley loves. \"You know, you set out wanting to be as famous as you can be, but then the closer it gets, you get a bit apprehensive,\" he says. He had seen the price of fame up close in brushes with the likes of Pete Doherty, and he could mine some of that experience for the Kerouac film. \"I feel quite safe and isolated in Germany,\" Riley says. \"My wife is very well known there. But I am only looked at when I am holding her hand.\"</p> <p>It allows him to maintain his inner Yorkshireman even, as he mentions in passing, now he is working with Angelina Jolie on the Disney film <em>Maleficent</em>. \"My parents are relieved as much as anything that I'm getting some work,\" he says with a smile. \"They get to visit me on set. I was driving them around Pinewood on a golf buggy. They met Angie. They loved all that. My father is a typical Yorkshireman. When I was about 12 the whole family went to Disneyland \u2013 it was our one real big holiday abroad. So he likes the fact Disney is now paying me. 'Sam, you realise that was like a free holiday now,' he told me.\"</p> <p>As the mother-fixated Kerouac discovered perhaps too late, however hard you try, you can never properly escape where you came from. Riley rather enjoys that fact. \"I caught myself looking at the thermometer outside the house the other day,\" he says. \"To see whether it was warmer than yesterday. I thought: 'Christ, it's happening. I'm becoming my dad.' I'll be getting the map out next and seeing exactly where we drove to in <em>On the Road</em>.\"</p> <p>On the Road<em> opens on 12 October</em></p>",
  "<p>A few years ago I went on a tour of <a href=\"http://lovelondoncouncilhousing.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/erno-goldfingers-balfron-tower.html\" title=\"Balfron Tower\">Balfron Tower</a>, a 26-storey block of flats in Poplar, east London. The brutalist Balfron, designed by Erno Goldfinger, was built in 1965-67, and for a few scant weeks in 1968 Goldfinger moved into the building himself, the better to convince the world how utterly fantastic his design was (his real home was in Hampstead). The legend goes that he and his wife, Ursula, threw champagne parties to find out what the residents \u2013 the building was owned by London County Council \u2013 liked (and disliked) about their new home. I don't know precisely what they told him, but someone ending up loving Balfron. In 1996 it was Grade II listed.</p> <p>Two things stick in my mind about my visit. The first was the lift, which stops only at every third floor, and was sinisterly long and narrow because, or so our guide told us, it was designed to accommodate a coffin. The second was a debate I had with an architectural historian inside a flat close to the top of the building. Naturally, he was all for Balfron. You should have seen the beatific expression that suffused his face as he urged me to admire its generous proportions, its clever layout, its wonderful view. I was less certain. Would you like to live here? I asked. He insisted that he would. Then he admitted that he actually lived in a Georgian house in Royal Greenwich.</p> <p>I suppose this was predictable. The dinner party myth about architects is that, just like your parents, they expect you to listen to what they say, not copy what they do. On their drawing boards lies the shock of the new: unlikely angles, acres of concrete (or metal or glass), severe corridors. Only then they put down their pencils, hop in their Fiat 500s and go home to something old and elegant, with sweeping banisters, delicate fanlights and biscuity floorboards.</p> <p>Is this fair? Surely there are lots of architects who practise what they preach, who see their houses as another expression of their work, as a private arena for solving problems and coming up with new ideas. And even if there aren't, does this matter? The fact that most fashion designers look truly awful doesn't stop us from wanting to buy their clothes. Why should we hold architects to a different standard from other creative professionals?</p> <p>If you spend all day thinking about how to make a building seem witty and sharp, perhaps it is soothing to retreat to something more, well, neutral \u2013 the architectural equivalent, you might say, of Philip Larkin rereading Dick Francis. To try to answer these questions, we interviewed some of the architects shortlisted for this year's Stirling prize in their own homes, on their own sofas. Where do they live, and how? Do their homes even remotely resemble the theatres, galleries and stadi ums on which their reputations are built? Or are they secret repositories of soggy sofas and wonky shelving? To find out, read on.</p> <h2>John Tuomey and Sheila O'Donnell <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396493615\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/21/1348232023969/Architects-John-Tuomey-an-018.jpg\" alt=\"Architects: John Tuomey and Sheila O'Donnell\" width=\"220\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Tuomey and Sheila O\u2019Donnell: 'It's easier to make decisions for others than for yourself' Photograph: Patrick Bolger for the Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Bolger/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The architects of Belfast's Lyric theatre on their Georgian home in Rathmines, Dublin</strong></p> <p>When Sheila O'Donnell and John Tuomey \u2013 partners in life as well as in architecture \u2013 moved into their Georgian house in Rathmines, Dublin, 20 years ago, the first thing they did was to remove the first floor. \"And that improved it greatly,\" says Tuomey, with a certain kind of understatement. More important, it was a move they knew they wouldn't be able ever to reverse. Why did that matter? \"Well, it's easy to make decisions for other people. It's more difficult for yourself, though I do know some architects who are wilful enough to do it.\" It's for similar reasons, he thinks, that so many architects favour Georgian houses. \"It's easier to pretend that something has happened to you, that you're stuck with some things. Also, Georgian houses are plain on the front, and loose enough [inside] to fade away and become architecture in a different sense \u2013 to become, perhaps, a kind of scaffolding.\"</p> <p>Removing the first floor turned the bottom of the house into one vast room, and the feeling when you walk into it, and gaze up at all its unexpected height, is of being in a tower, or a keep; there is even a kind of minstrels' gallery, a wooden walkway that leads out onto a roof terrace. But it's not austere. The space, scattered with books and comfortable chairs, isn't minimalist \u2013 and it is bounded, more cosily, by later, less dramatic additions at the back of the house: a garden room, built of concrete, glass and iroko (poor man's teak), and a tiny study, built entirely of wood, and painted to resemble a beach hut. The garden room, in particular, is a lovely space; airy, and open to the elements, but with a protected sturdiness that means you would be as content to sit in it in winter as in summer. \"Actually, it was a kind of experiment,\" says Tuomey. \"The windows were a test for the windows of the Lyric [the Belfast theatre that has won them a place on this year's Stirling prize shortlist]. We liked the feeling that you can have glassiness, without losing heaviness, that you can be contained at the same time as the outside is inside.\"</p> <p>Gutting the house, and doing lots of things to it at the same time so that it would look all of a piece, was not for Tuomey and O'Donnell. They prefer the idea of a conversation between old and new to the blank slate. \"This house is the story of the family,\" says O'Donnell (the couple have two sons). \"Each part of it tells a different part of that story. But I wouldn't call it a hotch-potch. Everything sits together quite happily, everything is built with the same sensibility, if not with the same materials.\"</p> <p>As Tuomey puts it: \"Without getting too theoretical, the most important thing in architecture is the feeling of the continuous present. Old and new things shouldn't look like they don't know one another. It's like a bookshelf: you put things beside each other, and there they stand. Your new thing should feel like it was already there, and has come into itself out of what was around it. Every single building was new, once, and it's not a crisis.\"</p> <p>You can feel this philosophy everywhere in their house. In the kitchen is a set of black leather and chrome Corbusier chairs \u2013 one of the first things they bought together, 30 years ago. Their dining table once belonged to O'Donnell's parents, only now it is surrounded by a good set of mid-century Danish chairs. In the garden, which feels vaguely Japanese, are two chairs by Jasper Morrison (the 1986 Thinking Man's Chair), but the space is also overlooked by the imposing copper dome of Rathmines church. You sense, powerfully, the couple's pleasure in things, in what Tuomey calls \"useful beauty\".</p> <p>Their house, like yours or mine, is an accumulation, a series of layers. But it is also a way of thinking about their work. \"Thinking about it is a way of keeping the mind agile, like a form of exercise,\" says O'Donnell. \"In that sense, not doing something, but talking about it ad infinitum, has a positive aspect. Everything is possible, for ever.\" In other words, there is always a plan. Right now, for instance, they are thinking about building a studio at the end of their garden. Will it happen? Perhaps. Then again, it might not. After all, even after two decades, their staircase still has no bannister. As they both tell me, they would install one tomorrow \u2013 if only they could definitively work out what might look, and feel, best.</p> <h2>David Chipperfield<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396493616\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/21/1348232293562/Architect-David-Chipperfi-002.jpg\" alt=\"Architect: David Chipperfield\" width=\"220\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Chipperfield: \u2018We lived with the old owner\u2019s drapes for a year.

He thinks the standard of discourse about architecture is quite low enough, without me going on about \u2013 as he puts it \u2013 lifestyle.</p> <p>\"In this country, we seem to have decided that the general public isn't interested in, or capable of, discussing architecture,\" he says. \"The debate is poor, and cliched. British society seems not to be comfortable talking about it at all unless some kind of big confrontation is involved, and this is a problem for us because it's society that commissions us in the end.\"</p> <p>On the other hand, as even he concedes: \"Seeing architecture differently from the way you see the rest of life is a bit weird. I believe one should be consistent in all that one does, from the books you read to the way you bring up your children. Everything you do is connected. The way we live as a family [he and his wife, Evelyn, have three children; he also has a son from his first marriage] is difficult to separate from the way we behave at the office. There's no line between them.\"</p> <p>A decade ago, Chipperfield built a house by the sea in Galicia, Spain. \"My children spend the summer there, and all the directors come, and our clients, and we probably have better conversations there than we do in the office.\"</p> <p>In London, the family shares a huge flat in Portland Place; the building \u2013 I would guess it was built in about 1920 \u2013 stands roughly halfway between John Nash's Park Crescent (at the north end of the street) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (whose HQ was designed by George Grey Wornum in the 1930s). Not that Chipperfield chose it for its proximity to RIBA. \"It was a trade-off. We wanted to live in the centre of London, and there are only so many ways you can do that unless you are very rich. To be honest, the ceilings are a bit low, it hasn't got great charm, it gets a bit dark at the back. You don't walk in, and say: oh, this is a nice room. It's not really architecture. There's a lot of plasterboard involved. But it's a nice, anonymous, urban flat, and you can walk to the theatre.\"</p> <p>He and his wife bought it from a Greek shipping magnate. \"We moved in, and for the first year, we lived with all the drapes. It was completely chintzy.\" How did that feel? \"I have to say it was quite relaxing because it [the interior] was clearly nothing to do with us.\" Eventually, though, they opened the flat up, and painted it white. \"Then we had the idea to divide the space using vitrines. There is a lot of dust in central London, and we have a lot of books, so I thought: let's make the shelves glass fronted. Then we thought: instead of collecting stuff and putting it in cupboards, why don't we put everything in them? Whenever we went travelling, the kids would find something, and say: I think this is for the cabinet.\"</p> <p>Chipperfield prefers horizontal living to vertical. \"Evelyn used to have this little house in Chelsea, and I called it the Staircase. That big table over there we brought with us from our old flat, and the idea was that the kids wouldn't go to their bedrooms to do their homework; they would do it there. We all work around one big table.\" The table is right beside the kitchen. \"That's part of the public space, the idea being that when someone's cooking, they're not on their own, and they don't have to shout 'Dinner's ready!' down a corridor.\"</p> <p>Does it bother him if things aren't quite right? (He has just told me that the enormous \u2013 and slightly uncomfortable \u2013 white leather modular sofa on which we're both sitting might soon be on its way out). \"Not really. It's the house in Spain that is my complete statement of intent. That's how I see architecture, and life. Of course, holiday homes are slightly easier. You have one of everything, and nothing more. Every CD we don't listen to I send back to London, and the books are all culled. Not in a minimalistic way; in a precise way. It's like a ship: everything on it, you want to go down with. All my values are somehow in it.\"</p> <p>In the end, though, houses that depend on everything inside them being just so are probably a kind of failure. Good architecture is robust, he tells me, with the result that it is also remarkably forgiving. \"There's a tyranny in having to have everything straight. We have a bit of that here, but hopefully not too much.\"</p> <h2>Rod Sheard <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396493617\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/21/1348232746937/Architect-Rob-Sheard-006.jpg\" alt=\"Architect: Rob Sheard\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rob Sheard: \u2018I love simple spaces, but it\u2019s what goes on inside that matters.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The leader of the team that designed the Olympic stadium on his new-brick mews house in Putney, south-west London</strong></p> <p>Rod Sheard, who led the team at Populous, which designed the Olympic stadium, lives in a mews house \u2013 in fact, it's two houses knocked together \u2013 close to the Thames in Putney, south-west London. Or at least, his address insists on the word \"mews\". In reality, we're talking about a cul-de-sac; this eerily quiet enclave was built only 20 years ago, by which time the need for stables&#xa0;and carriage houses had long since passed.</p> <p>Sheard is Australian, and when he first moved to London in the 70s, he lived in Crouch End. But then his practice started to grow, and it seemed sensible to buy an office building, rather than merely to rent one. So he moved west. \"A developer was selling six houses here,\" he says. \"A group of us \u2013 we were all friends \u2013 got together and negotiated to buy all of them. A few of them have moved away now, but for a while it was our own little community.\" Meanwhile, his practice moved into a building across the courtyard, with the result that his commute now involves a stroll of less than two minutes.</p> <p>How does his home connect to his working life as an architect? \"That's a complicated question. I love simple, clean spaces, but it's what goes on inside that matters most.\" Sheard admits he sometimes lies in bed at night worrying about his buildings (Populous is now in competition to design the French national rugby stadium in Paris). But his own home troubles him not at all.</p> <p>\"If the house were more imposing, we might feel differently. But it's not sacrosanct. We move things about all the time. Corbusier had it just about right when he talked about machines for living. We don't dwell on it. It's a utilitarian thing.\" From where I'm sitting, on a pale leather sofa, I can see an Arco floor lamp but not much else in the way of iconic pieces. Where, I wonder, is his Eames recliner? Isn't it the law that he should own one? He laughs. \"We've got a Corb recliner.\" Is he fussy about furniture? \"Only to a minimal level. Architects get things out of perspective sometimes.\"</p> <p>I suggest that it's surprising such a distinguished architect would choose to live in such a relatively undistinguished building (across the UK, there must be many thousands of houses like this one, built of biscuity new brick with a dash of stucco and the occasional balustrade). Again, he laughs. \"I'm sorry to be such a disappointment. But we do have another home in Sydney, and I designed that one myself.\"</p> <p>What's it like? \"Well, I was very into de Stijl [the Dutch artistic movement, founded in 1917, whose leading lights included Piet Mondrian and Gerrit Rietveld] at the time. So it's a series of white cubes, with certain elements \u2013 the awnings, the chimney \u2013 picked out in bright colours.\" With its view of the bay, its pontoons and its pools, it sounds lovely; and perhaps \u2013 though this is my interpretation, not Sheard's \u2013 it gives its architect licence not to worry too much about this place, over which, he jokes, he has only \"as much control as my wife and kids allow\".</p>",
  "<p>Far from green shoots bursting forth, Lee Hopley, chief economist of manufacturers' group the EEF, sees a shadow falling over British industry. \"It feels like the mood has shifted down over the last quarter: the dark clouds do appear to be gathering,\" she says.</p> <p>Recession in the eurozone, the slowdown in China and the risk that America is heading for a \"fiscal cliff\" are all making exporters nervous, while demand at home remains relatively weak, she argues. The latest official figures showed that manufacturing output in July was 0.5% lower than a year earlier \u2013 though recent surveys show a modest pick-up in confidence.</p> <p>Individual manufacturers echo Hopley's assessment. \"There's been no further drop-off in demand; but if we saw any further drop-off, the patient would be dead,\" says James Greenham, managing director of EMS Physio, which sells hi-tech equipment for physiotherapists from its base just outside Oxford.</p> <p>\"I certainly don't see any uplift in business for the UK,\" he says. Many of his products are for export, which makes EMS exactly the sort of manufacturer Vince Cable is trying to encourage; but Greenham says most markets are seeing a slowdown.</p> <p>\"There's still demand from certain parts of the world \u2013 the Middle East and Asia \u2013 but I'm not aware of any country where the distributor is saying, 'things are brilliant'.\"</p> <p>Having lost out on an \u00a38,000 NHS contract to an overseas rival, Greenham would like to see the government using its procurement budget to back British firms.</p> <p>For Andrew Churchill, the managing director of precision engineering firm JJ Churchill, based in Leicestershire with 130 employees, the situation changes depending on which part of his industry you look at. \"We're seeing a very mixed picture,\" he says.</p> <p>In defence, lead-in times are so long that orders are still bouncing back from the recession of 2008-09. \"We made massive reinvestment during the recession ... and we're well placed to benefit from the recovery.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the parts his firm manufactures for giant diesel engines, though, business has declined by a third; yet the civil aerospace business is still \"brisk\", as is the car industry, where the expansion of Jaguar Land Rover, for example, has had knock-on benefits throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>Churchill would like to see the government take kick-starting growth more seriously. \"From my perspective, I support Osborne's fiscal mandate, and I think the deficit is very important; but we haven't seen any effect with regards to stimulating growth: there's an economic mandate that's missing.\"</p> <p>Green shoot rating \u2605</p> <h2>Banking</h2> <p>By the end of this month, Royal Bank of Scotland will have paid \u00a32.5bn in fees for the insurance it bought from the government to insure its most toxic assets. Three years after joining the asset protection scheme, the bailed-out bank is expected to withdraw from it in the coming weeks after surviving the downturn without having to make a claim on the policy that played such a vital role in keeping it afloat in the dark days of the crisis.</p> <p>That is one green shoot, perhaps, for a banking industry that was brought to its knees four years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p> <p>But as Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, points out, it is hardly a major step, given that the taxpayer will still be left with an 81% stake in the Edinburgh-based bank. That stake, which once stood closer to 84%, has only been falling because the bank is issuing new shares to outside investors, thereby diluting the government stake.</p> <p>Similarly, the taxpayer stake in Lloyds Banking Group has fallen to just below 40% as a result of the issue of new shares. It is hardly a healthy picture, but in the past two months the share prices of many banks have enjoyed a minor rally \u2013 a sign perhaps that the worst may be over for an industry that has more recently been saddled with scandals ranging from attempting to rig the Libor rate to laundering money for drug barons in Mexico.</p> <p>Yet the launch of the Funding for Lending programme by George Osborne, aimed at getting more credit into the economy, is further evidence that the banking industry is still not functioning normally. Lending by banks to small businesses has continued to decline. The Federation of Small Businesses last week said that 42% of firms seeking loans were being turned down. Meanwhile, BDRC Continental's quarterly SME Finance Monitor found that only 43% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) used external finance such as a bank loan, compared with 51% just three months earlier.</p> <p>The moribund state of the lending market has prompted critics of the banking industry to call for greater state control. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott says: \"There can be no sustainable green shoots while the big banks, and critically RBS, are starving small firms of finance\".</p> <p>RBS and Lloyds are already subject to major restructuring programmes to reduce their riskiness. This is a positive sign, while the low interest rate environment is helping to keep bank's provisions for bad debts down, despite an economic environment that should suggest an increase of customers in trouble.</p> <p>But for banks, there is not much sign that their businesses are growing. \"Things might be getting less worse,\" says Gordon \u2013 but he adds that any improvement is \"based on falling bad debts and costs and not on a revenue&#xa0;story\".</p> <p><strong>Green shoot rating </strong>\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Hotels</h2> <p>At the 16-room <a href=\"http://www.seaspraybrighton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sea Spray hotel near Brighton's seafront</a>, where a bed for the night can cost anything from \u00a349 to \u00a3285 (if you opt for the Manhattan penthouse with whirlpool bath) Simon Etheridge is feeling festive. \"We've already taken a booking for Christmas this morning,\" he says.</p> <p>During the long, soggy summer of sport, there were apocalyptic anecdotes of hotels and restaurants standing empty as Brits stayed at home to watch the Olympics and overseas visitors avoided the country because of warnings of transport chaos. Earnings from foreign visitors to Britain were 6% lower in July than the same month last year; but there are hopes that business will pick up in the autumn.</p> <p>In Brighton, Etheridge insists, \"business has been great\". In the West Country, Nicci Clarke of <a href=\"http://www.139bath.co.uk/about_onethreenine.asp\" title=\"\">One Three Nine</a> 139, an upmarket bed-and-breakfast in Bath, also says that trade this year has been \"quite good actually\" \u2013 and she's already taken some advance bookings for Boxing Day onwards.</p> <p>Alessandra Pino, of the Italian restaurant <a href=\"http://www.locandalocatelli.com/\" title=\"\">Locanda Locatelli</a> in London, says business was good even during the Olympics, and she too is upbeat about December. \"The Christmas season is normally when the restaurant is at its fullest and we expect this year to be no different.\" But not everyone is so confident: Anthony Flinn of <a href=\"http://www.anthonysrestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Anthony's restaurant in Leeds</a> says it's been a \"very hard year,\" with the number of diners up, but total takings down, as customers economised.</p> <p>One reason for optimism is that inflation has been falling steadily, from its peak above 5% last autumn to 2.5% in August. That should help to ease the squeeze on families' finances, which has been restraining spending \u2013 and which the Office for Budget Responsibility has cited as one of the key reasons for repeatedly downgrading its growth forecasts.</p> <p>Wages are rising at an average rate of less than 2% a year, according to the Office for National Statistics, so real incomes are still declining; but a marginally slower squeeze may still help tempt consumers to loosen their purse strings, and pop out for a family meal, or a weekend break.

It was only launched last month, but with employment picking up in some parts of Britain, estate agents are reporting a more positive mood abroad.</p> <p>David Baker of David Baker &amp; Co in the Vale of Glamorgan says the local housing market is the \"best it's been for three years\".</p> <p>In Exeter, Hannah Edge of Strutt and Parker says business was quiet during the summer as potential house-hunters stayed at home to watch the Olympics. With the Games out of the way, however, she says, \"the last two weeks have been busier\". Philip Hiatt, boss of Your Move Philip Hiatt in West Sussex, echoes her assessment, saying: \"September has been a lot busier than the summer.\" He adds that the property market is \"not as bad as it is perceived\".</p> <p>So far there is little sign that cheaper loans and stronger levels of business in high street estate agents are feeding through to house prices, however. While the average cost of a London home has continued to rise, buoyed by strong demand from foreign buyers looking for a safe haven from the turmoil in the eurozone, in most parts of the UK prices are moving sideways or falling.</p> <p>The latest Nationwide house price index showed prices down 0.7% on a year earlier in August. The regional breakdown, last published in June, showed prices falling in nine of 13 regions nationwide. In Wales, the cost of an average home fell by 5.3% in the year to June, for example; in the north-west, there was a 4.3% decline.</p> <p>Ed Stansfield, property economist at consultancy Capital Economics, warns that shaving a few tenths of a percentage point off the interest rate on mortgages is unlikely to get the stalled housing market moving. Banks still have billions of pounds of loans on their books from the boom years that they fear may not be paid back in full, as prices continue to drift downwards. \"Their attitude is, 'I'm not going to do anything that isn't as close to 100% safe as it can be,'\" he says \u2013 hence the large deposits many lenders are demanding from first-time buyers.</p> <p>\"Since Funding for Lending was announced, there has been a steady downward movement in mortgage rates,\" says Ray Boulger of mortgage broker John Charcol. But he warns that new borrowers are unlikely to rush into the market unless banks loosen their loan criteria.</p> <p><strong>Green shoot rating </strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Retail</h2> <p>The recession was \"like a kick in the teeth\" for Birmingham florist Bal Baines and he was not alone.

For most retailers it is the most important quarter of the year, as it is when they bank the lion's share of their annual profits. Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert thinks the prospect of inflation rising again will continue to overshadow consumer confidence: \"We expect a subdued trend in spending to continue over the next two months with consumers saving ahead of Christmas.\"</p> <p>Lucia Martin, from independent toy store Bubbles and Squeak in York, says sales are 10% down on last year but is optimistic ahead of its busiest season: \"If we're lucky it will be the same as last year.\"</p> <p>Green shoot rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p>",
  "<p>If ever there was a perfect match of game and hardware, it has surely come in the form of <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> and the PlayStation Vita and, while it may not have the most imaginative of titles, the two do come together to present a wealth of good ideas and enchanting characters.</p> <p>The reason this fourth release in the LittleBigPlanet series is so well suited to its new host device is simple. The game is a platformer \u2013 if you're unfamiliar, think Mario's early adventures as a reference point. What distinguishes the LittleBigPlanet games from Nintendo's plumber, however, is that most levels offer two layers of scenery laid over each other, presenting a seemingly 2D world, but with a foreground and background between which protagonist Sackboy can move.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the front and back of the Vita are touch-sensitive; a fact that lets players prod and push the game's scenery with their fingers between the two planes of movement. The result is some thrilling level design, and an intuitive control system that is only rarely clumsy.</p> <p>Accompanied by magnificent music and an ambitious level creation tool,&nbsp;it <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>'s design rivals the series's best. It may feel familiar to those that have enjoyed Sackboy's company before, but is nonetheless a delight to play, making full use of the platform&nbsp;on which it has most assuredly now found a&nbsp;new home.</p>",

Working with <a href=\"http://www.tomtom.com/en_us/\" title=\"\">TomTom</a>, it has a clean look, with spoken turn-by-turn navigation and traffic updates. The beautiful 3D flyover views being shown off in the ads aren't available in the UK yet, but the integration with all of the iPhone's features is now prioritised. For example, Siri, the voice-control app, which has been vastly improved, now offers a local search where you can simply ask it to&#xa0;recommend a bar or restaurant.</p> <p>The camera app has also been improved. It is quicker to take pictures and has a panorama mode, to capture up to 240 degrees of landscape. The device then stitches together multiple images to create one impressive panoramic shot.</p> <p>The iPhone 5 will also be the first to offer 4G, making high-speed mobile downloads available for the first time. EE, Orange and T-Mobile's parent company, will be the only network offering the service later in the year.

  "<p>With its exuberant mix of cartoonish graphics, adolescent humour and preposterous violence, <a href=\"http://www.borderlandsthegame.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Borderlands</em></a> was the surprise hit of 2009. But wouldn't the inevitable sequel just be more of the same politically incorrect shoot-and-loot action?

  "<p>Film fans enduring the typically murky stereoscopy of <em>Dredd 3D</em> in UK cinemas may also experience a sense of deja vu about its plot, which traps beleaguered law enforcement agents in a tower block run by vicious drug-dealing criminals, from which they must attempt to escape with their lives. A strikingly similar scenario underpins Gareth Huw Evans's altogether superior martial-arts thriller <strong>The Raid</strong> (2011, Momentum, 18), though any comparison between the two ends there. For while <em>Dredd</em> galumphs its heavy booted, bombastic way around the screen, <em>The Raid</em> is altogether lighter on its feet, reminding us of the close comparison between martial arts movies and highly choreographed musicals, both of which have the unmistakeable physicality of acrobatic human interaction at their heart.</p> <p>Incongruously directed in Indonesia by Welshman Evans, <em>The Raid</em> plays its head-cracking hand in a high-rise Jakarta slum where the local crime lord has taken residence, and whence he is due to be flushed by a top Swat team. Yet once inside the building, the troops find themselves faced by a makeshift private army, all willing to defend their landlord-cum-mob-boss to the death. What follows is a series of bone-crunching fight sequences in which the feet and fists fly as the body count spirals, each knockout punch topping the one before. Tipping his hat towards a variety of pulp sources, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80851/die-hard\" title=\"\"><em>Die Hard</em></a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77171/assault-on-precinct-13\" title=\"\"><em>Assault on Precinct 13</em></a> via <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/106376/ong-bak\" title=\"\"><em>Ong-bak</em></a> and beyond, Evans ups the ante with deliriously vibrant scenes of destruction, leaving the viewer wincing, gawping and gasping for breath. Extras include a director's commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes including one on Mike Shonoda and Joe Trapanese's score, and (most bizarrely) Lee Hardcastle's purr-fectly pitched animated remake, <a href=\"http://leehardcastle.com/videos/claycats-the-raid/\" title=\"\"><em>Claycat's The Raid</em></a>.</p> <p>Having topped both the cinema and DVD charts with <em>Marvel Avengers Assemble</em>, Joss Whedon cements his reputation as genre cinema's go-to guy with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cabin-Woods-DVD-Chris-Hemsworth/dp/B006DZQZEQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348056547&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>The Cabin in the Woods</strong></a> (2011, Lionsgate, 15) on which he takes both screenwriting and production credits. A cine-literate riff on a range of archetypal horrors, this flits between the joyous nastiness of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/34582/evil-dead\" title=\"\"><em>The Evil Dead</em></a> and the postmodernity of <em>Wes Craven's New Nightmare</em> with aplomb. Ignoring the warnings of a caricatured old-timer, a group of apparently disposable friends head off to the titular torture house, where they are duly haunted and stalked by an off-the-peg assortment of bad things that go bump in the night. Playfully revealing its magic puzzle secrets, this Rubik's cube romp deftly shifts between dreams and nightmares, wearing its Halloween fright-mask with a sardonic smile throughout. While some may balk at the outlandish final act, there's no doubting the infectious affection of the film's descent into the mouth of madness, and Whedon's admirable desire to treat fans as sentient beings rather than brainless dorks. Extras include commentary from Whedon and writer/director Drew Goddard, who previously wrote the screenplay for <em>Cloverfield</em>.</p> <p>Ken Loach's most sprightly and positive film to date (more so, even, than the terrific <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129188/looking-for-eric\" title=\"\"><em>Looking for Eric</em></a>), <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Angels-Share-Theatrical-Version-DVD/dp/B008TQA2NW/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348056501&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>The Angels' Share</strong></a> (2011, Entertainment One, 15) is an uplifting caper about a former bad lad who discovers that he has a nose for whisky and resolves to turn his newfound skill to the crafty advantage of him and his mates. Working from yet another top-notch screenplay by the versatile Paul Laverty and boasting a brace of engaging and convincing performances, this blends Loach's trademark tough social realism (Robbie's violent past is faced unflinchingly and without special pleading) with a rewarding strand of escapist fantasy. Sometimes riotously funny, often poignantly melancholic, this is another profoundly humanist work from film-makers who seem to find honest joy in the extraordinary lives of \"ordinary\" people. The result is one of my favourite films of the year so far, a genuinely feelgood gem in which the darkness lurking in the background makes the light of positivity shine all the brighter. For those untroubled by earthy epithets, the 18-rated Blu-ray reinstates eight uses of the F- and C-words previously redubbed to achieve a 15 certificate.</p> <p>The cross-cultural romantic-comedy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Good-Time-DVD-Arsher/dp/B0085MXR2S/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348057023&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>All in Good Time</strong></a> (2012, StudioCanal, 12) began life as a stage play by <em>Alfie</em> writer Bill Naughton, which formed the basis of the film <em>The Family Way</em>, a moderate hit boosted by a Paul McCartney soundtrack. Seeing the movie on TV one wet Sunday afternoon, <em>East Is East</em> writer Ayub Khan-Din noticed a striking similarity between its domineering patriarchal figure and his own father, and subsequently penned an Asian version of the film for the stage under the name <em>Rafta, Rafta</em>, which picked up an Olivier award for best new comedy. Now this tale of two newlyweds living under one oppressively parental roof finds its way back to the screen courtesy of <em>Calendar Girls</em> helmsman Nigel Cole, who recently scored an artistic (if not financial) triumph with the wonderful <em>Made in Dagenham</em>. As usual, Cole proves himself adept at addressing potentially preachy social issues in a manner which is both entertaining and unobtrusive. There are some fine comic turns here, not least from Meera Syal and Harish Patel as the omnipresent mum and dad, and some charming backstory detail about working in a \"proper\" cinema. It's also admirably even-handed in its attitude to both sex and the sexes, though occasionally things stray a touch too far into <em>Carry On</em> territory with Karma Sutras, bouncing bedsprings and the like. No masterpiece, then, but warmly likable nonetheless.</p> <p>While there have been plenty of movies documenting the heroism of the resistance in Nazi-occupied France, Ismael Ferroukhi's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Men-DVD-Tahar-Rahim/dp/B0085NGM7O/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348056445&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Free Men</strong></a> (2011, Artificial Eye, 12) takes a new tack. Rising star Tahar Rahim plays a young Algerian black-marketeer who agrees to spy on a Paris mosque in return for his freedom, and discovers personal and political enlightenment en route. Although the storytelling is fairly mundane, there are committed performances from Rahim and Michael Lonsdale, both of whom continue to command the camera's attention. There's also something pertinently surprising about a story which centres on Muslims defending Jews from their oppressors, and risking their own freedom in the process. Compare this eye-opening narrative with the comedic cliches of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dictator-DVD-Sacha-Baron-Cohen/dp/B007VDGBE8/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348056480&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>The Dictator</strong></a> (2011, Paramount, 15) whose central Arab-despot gag has been decried by some as racist (the BBFC duly notes that \"the film contains racial stereotyping and racist stereotyping but does not as a whole condone such language or behaviour\") but suffers more from being drearily unfunny. Not only are all the best jokes in the trailer, most of them are better in the trailer; as always, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sachabaroncohen\" title=\"\">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> works best in short bursts, a problem hardly alleviated by the inclusion of an additional 15&#xa0;minutes in the now obligatory extended cut.</p>",
  "<p>Q: What do <a href=\"http://www.junotdiaz.com/\" title=\"\">Junot D\u00edaz's</a> three books have in common? A: Yunior, the flamboyantly unfaithful Dominican narrator who talks a streetwise American-English studded with Spanish slang. This repetition is a brave gambit with an enormous payoff. In <em>Drown</em> (short stories, 1996), Yunior's voice was not quite fully formed. Nervous of its own newness, the book included a glossary for some of the Spanish terms (coyly omitting words such as leche or chochas \u2013 <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/\" title=\"\">Google Translate</a> if you're not hispanophone). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\" title=\"\"><em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em></a> (Pulitzer prize-winning novel, 2007) left the Spanish unglossed and borrowed from the vocabularies of sci-fi and fantasy. Now this second collection refines Yunior's voice further, into an utterly convincing idiolect that takes in delicate literary detail and tough bilingual argot.</p> <p>In D\u00edaz, there are always other stories taking place away from the main narrative. Yunior is centre stage in <em>This Is How You Lose Her</em>: although his brother, Rafa, has cancer, his primary concern is his own life and heartbreaks. D\u00edaz's great achievement is to remain true to the helpless solipsism that possesses all of us most of the time, while allowing the reader to see those other stories on the periphery of Yunior's purview.</p> <p>\"Invierno\" is a spare, unsentimental account of immigration. Rafa, Yunior and their mother have come to New Jersey to join their father. It is snowing and Papi won't let them leave the apartment for weeks. We follow Yunior's struggles with language and his doomed attempts to befriend the white children from the neighbouring apartment. In the background, Papi is having an affair. Yunior is no naive, unreliable narrator; he knows, more or less, what's going on, but he is more worried about taming his afro-ish hair to avoid trouble from Papi (who eventually shaves it off). Here is the beautifully understated ending, when the family \u2013 minus Papi \u2013 finally leave the apartment: \"We even saw the ocean, up there at the top of Westminster, like the blade of a long, curved knife. Mami was crying but we pretended not to notice. We threw snowballs at the sliding cars and once I removed my cap just to feel the snowflakes scatter across my cold, hard scalp.\"</p> <p><em>This Is How You Lose Her</em>: the title announces the theme, which is, overwhelmingly, infidelity. D\u00edaz writes a cracking love rat and the only weak moments are the self-consciously right-thinking ones. (Like \"Otravida, Otravez\", the one non-Yunior narrative, which attempts to tell the woman's side of things.) Alongside the addictive voice and killer eye for detail (\"his stubble quivering in beads of water, compass needles\"), the chief pleasure of these stories is the unflinching honesty D\u00edaz brings to the subject of betrayal.</p> <p>In \"The Sun, the Moon, the Stars\", Yunior loves Magda but cheats on her with Cassandra anyway. Magda asks if Cassandra was good in bed. \"To be honest, baby, it was lousy,\" Yunior tells her \u2013 then confides to the reader: \"That one is never very believable but you got to say it anyway no matter how stupid and unreal it sounds: say it.\" Later, we learn that in the first week of knowing Cassandra, Yunior \"made the mistake of telling her that sex with Madga had never been top notch\". Cassandra advises him \"to find a girlfriend who could fuck\". And they soon wind up in bed together.</p> <p>This is Yunior remembering the beginning of the infidelity: \"The first night we did it \u2013 and it was good, too, she wasn't false advertising \u2013 I felt so lousy that I couldn't sleep, even though she was one of those sisters whose body fits next to you perfect. I was like, She knows, so I called Magda right from the bed and asked her if she was OK.</p> <p>You sound strange, she said.</p> <p>I remember Cassandra pressing the hot cleft of her pussy against my leg and me saying, I just miss you.\"</p> <p>It's all there: every lie dissected, each surprising emotion itemised. A reviewer's cliche, perhaps, but if you liked his two previous books, you'll love this one, because D\u00edaz is boldly, brilliantly, doing the same thing again, only better.</p>",
  "<p>A man steps across the floor of what seems to be a basement or dungeon, on a film shot by a wobbly, handheld camera. Blood, sticky underfoot, runs beneath his boots \u2013 and the camera catches what seems to be a severed head. The scene is being played on a computer screen, watched by an intense young man, transfixed. A beautiful girl looks also, over his shoulder. \"Is that Iraq?\", she asks, squirming at the degenerate and apparently gratuitous cruelty. \"Mexico,\" replies the man with a grunt, clearly terrified himself. Welcome to the latest film by Hollywood's \u2013 even America's \u2013 heretic-in-chief, Oliver Stone. Unsurprisingly, this brief exchange is charged with greater meaning than it appears at first sight, and the film's director has come to elaborate.</p> <p>The physical presence of Oliver Stone is not unlike that of his impact on cinema over the last four decades. He is immediately contrapuntal: tanned leathery skin, khaki waistcoat and black boots in the seamless, breezy tranquillity of a grandiose hotel in Berlin, answering waiters' questions in polite German with a growl, complimenting the pretty-prim waitress on her looks with a gravelly chuckle. And when he gets down to the business of explaining his new film \u2013 sleeves rolled up, hair like that of an old rocker (which he is) \u2013 there is no polite prologue to the heresy. \"Yeah, this is one of America's wild wars that never ends and ain't going anywhere: the war on drugs.\" After all, this is the man who has \u2013 famously or infamously, depending on who you are \u2013 subverted and scorned every norm, rhyme and reason on which the narrative of the US political establishment (and America's strut in the world) is premised, his canon thereby so much greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36343/platoon\" title=\"\"><em>Platoon</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89121/born.on.the.fourth.of.july\" title=\"\"><em>Born on the Fourth of July</em></a> were pivotal contributions to America's attempt at reckoning with its own self-generated catastrophe in Vietnam; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77907/jfk\" title=\"\"><em>JFK</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/61568/nixon\" title=\"\"><em>Nixon</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/09/w-review\" title=\"\"><em>W.</em></a> retold and revolutionised received wisdom on the death of one president and the lives of two others. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/oct/01/drama\" title=\"\"><em>World Trade Center</em></a> rescued the human story of 9/11 from that manipulated by Washington for its own reasons.</p> <p>Perhaps most cogently of all, with hindsight, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/117586/salvador\" title=\"\"><em>Salvador</em></a>, from 1986, was among very few films or mainstream expressions of any kind which looked at the dirty war that ravaged the Americas during the 1980s through a Latin American lens, repositioning President Reagan's role as more that of jackboot than sponsor of the freedom he claimed to be spreading, through alliances with dictators and death squads. And more recently, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131532/south-of-the-border\" title=\"\"><em>South of the Border</em></a> stood and stands as the only attempt of its kind to document a new dynamic across the hemisphere, and the rise of newly confident leftwing leaders in the Latin Americas, unbowed by the colossus, the US. Stone's latest, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146822/savages\" title=\"\"><em>Savages</em></a>, is to be seen in that vein \u2013 only the story concerns the country that is a mere 20 minutes walk from Texas across the Rio Grande, and just south of the border from the golden beaches of San Diego. It addresses the first war of the 21st century (which gives us a glimpse of what the rest of it may well look like), the narco cartel war in Mexico.</p> <p>Of course Stone is drawn to this: Mexico's war \u2013 if that is what it is \u2013 has claimed 50,000 lives, and has done so with striking and baffling cruelty. \"A lot of these people have died slowly,\" says Stone, approaching his theme. \"I didn't want to show people being dissolved in acid, and there are plenty of other things we could have shown but didn't, or had to cut.\"</p> <p>Indeed there are: in his hypothetical but meticulously researched film Stone does not detail the sewing of a flayed face to a soccer ball, or the decapitated bodies left dangling from bridges, mutilated corpses strewn along highways or filling mass graves. Strangely, though, the US media seems as keen to avoid mention of the daily litany of death across its underbelly as it is to cover it; even less does the American establishment want to understand <em>why</em> all this is happening, and consider the possibility that there may be deep-rooted economic causes of at least aspects of Mexico's agony for which the US bears some responsibility, quite apart from its insatiable need to consume drugs and welcome the profits they generate through its banks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KC2zbOwbeEs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KC2zbOwbeEs?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>High time for a major film about all this, in an America which, as Stone says, \"doesn't give a shit\" \u2013 even though the violence is next door and spilling over the US government's fence through the desert, in defiance of Washington's militarisation of the sieve-like border. America wants there to be a wall along the 2,000 miles it shares with Mexico, like the one that once ran beneath the window at which Stone sits in Berlin. But that is not going to happen when the border is also the busiest commercial frontier in the world, crossed by a million people every day.</p> <p>At first sight, Stone may seem to have flinched from making this badly needed film. <em>Savages</em> is not for the most part set in Mexico, not is it overtly about Mexico, as it might have been. It is an adaptation of a novel by the great American writer on the border and drug war, Don Winslow, about two men: Chon, a traumatised veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, and Ben, a karmic botanist par excellence. Their combined experience and knowledge enables them to grow marijuana of unrivalled potency and quality. It also helps them secure the devotion of lovely blonde O, whom they share as a narcotic-erotic <em>m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois</em>.</p> <p>Stone's generic Baja cartel, led by a matriarch called Elena, is set on acquiring the seed if not its growers, and kidnaps O in pursuit of this aim. The boys react heroically, and set out to rescue their woman. In the background is an aspirant <em>deus ex machina</em>, Dennis, a corrupt agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, who works alongside not only Don and Chon, but also the cartel's vicious enforcer on the US side, Lado.</p> <p>There is detail in the film which Stone is the first \u2013 and only one, north of the border \u2013 to grasp, and the detail is important in reading not only this narco war, but also what it means to modern capitalist society. First is the perverse innovation in the cruelty, for its own sake and its recreational aspect. Stone treats us to the execution of a suspected snitch, hung by his wrists and whipped until he confesses (even though he is innocent), after which he is incinerated alive with a tyre around his arms and torso, running in wild circles to his death. During the scene, there's a moment of mastery: the soundtrack, the cackling laughter of those watching. It takes Stone to work that out. Yes, in Mexico's war, this is <em>fun</em>. \"It's getting crueller out there,\" muses Stone. \"It's gone up a level.\"</p> <p>Another insight is the cartels' mastery of the internet and along with it their satanic sense of humour. The tit-for-tat over kidnapped O is conducted largely through cyberspace, and at one point the cartel sends our heroic duo an animated cartoon of the decapitation of their girl. And there is this about the real-life cartels: unlike the Bosnian Serbs or even al-Qaida, they do not need to speak to us, to the media or politicians, except on their terms. They control their message, they do so through their own <em>mantas</em> or banners, sick but funny notes pinned to the more illustrious victims' mutilated corpses, but above all through the internet \u2013 and in doing so they laugh at us. They have no cause to proselytise, nor is there any retort to them \u2013 that is their sick genius, and that is why they laugh. \"Yeah \u2013 that humour thing,\" says Stone. \"It's something else. It takes someone who knows what's going on to understand it, the humour and the cruelty. I was scared of it, but I wanted to make sure I could keep time with what is going on.\"</p> <p>One of Stone's hallmarks, in films such as <em>JFK</em> and <em>W.</em>, is that he make you suspend disbelief so thoroughly that you can be forgiven for thinking you're observing the real thing, not a dramatisation. In <em>Savages</em> Stone has mercilessly captured the horrific details of Mexico's war and it is tempting to ask why he opted for an action movie with rather annoyingly gym-cut Colgate Californians and a Barbie-blonde stoner as its central characters, instead of something that gets us inside Mexico. Inside, if not the Tijuana cartel, which is now, as Stone himself admits, \"dealing with small pocket change\", then a film about those others who are redefining what a narco cartel \u2013 indeed, criminality \u2013 is in the new world and global economy. The paramilitary Zetas, for example, are an entirely new breed of syndicate, utterly ruthless, apparently unstoppable. It seems a shame that even a film by America's most irreverent director (who has looked at the US through a rare Latin American eyepiece) <em>must</em> be centred on the United States. One would like Stone's take on the world's most wanted criminal, Joaqu\u00edn \"Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, fugitive leader of the Sinaloa cartel, or his nemesis, who has overtaken even him for savagery, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, founder of Los Zetas.</p> <p>But actually I am missing the point completely, thinking this way. Stone has a terrifying and convincing thesis as to why the film has to be set in America, with American characters: \"The point,\" he says, \"is that wars come home, they come home to roost. And there are connections: one of the two main guys has come home from Afghanistan and Iraq, and he's brought all that with him, what I think are new levels of cruelty and combat technology we have out there.\"</p> <p>He drives his theme: \"Of course, humankind has always been cruel \u2013 the Third Reich and so on. But I think there are new levels of cruelty, new technologies now, a new ball game. Maybe I'm wrong, but the cruelty level in the world just went up in these recent wars. We get a lot of information about what's happening in Iraq, the Middle East and Afghanistan, which comes back to America with this guy. And who knows how this may influence what's happening in Mexico \u2013 I think it probably does.\"</p> <p>It's a shocking but cogent point about the nature of the violence, and its arrival into our public domain. Stone cut his teeth in Vietnam, where images of violence (the famous girl on the bridge burned by napalm; and scenes from Stone's own films and past as a veteran) were supposed to shock us \u2013 and did. Now, in reality, all that has volte-faced: the Zetas relay their own atrocities on the web as recruiting posters, and in Stone's film, to parley with their proposed business partners. It has been posited before that the Zetas got their ideas for torture and execution videos from al-Qaida, who in turn respond to souvenir photos taken by American troops of their own abuses in Abu Ghraib. Stone, typically, hurls us to the logical, heretical, conclusion.</p> <p>\"This Middle East thing brought it to another level. The barbarism came back in a big way, and it was Bush who started that. It all began with Afghanistan and Iraq. The guy in the movie brings it home; and the cartel brings it home.\"</p> <p>There are cinematic considerations too: \"It's based on Winslow,\" says Stone, \"and we've made it into a thriller. No, I don't think the cartels would work that way with independent marijuana growers in California. No, there aren't any IEDs going off in the Californian desert \u2013 but,\" and he grins with inimitably Stoneian mischief, \"I like the idea!\"</p> <p>Another subtlety is Stone's depiction of the fall of Elena, the matriarch. This occurs as the result of a mutiny by Lado, who has switched sides to a rival, El Azul, and because she comes to California to visit her daughter. Her collapse \u2013 and with it, by implication, that of her cartel \u2013 could signify the arrival of a greater power, a new cartel led by El Azul. This has happened in real life: Guzm\u00e1n has defeated the Tijuana cartel, which was led by one of the first female <em>capos</em>, Enedina Arellano F\u00e9lix. It could be because \"it's tough taking orders from a woman\", observes Stone of Lado. But it could also be seen as Elena's weakness of character, or at least her old-fashioned view of what a cartel's code should be. As Stone puts it: \"She's a good traditional woman. She's proud of the fact that her daughter is ashamed of her. And her fall is the fall of the don. Elena was weak because she had a thing for her daughter and wanted to rescue her.\" This is exactly it: the mutation of Mexico's cartels from the don of old, with his (or her) attachment to family and codes of honour, however criminal or perverse they were, and the transfer of power to those whose only code is raw ruthlessness \u2013 like Guzm\u00e1n or, to an even greater degree, the Zetas.</p> <p>In <em>Savages</em>, the DEA agent Dennis is corrupt and credible. He protects Chon and Ben for money, takes a bribe to deliver them Elena's daughter, and gets to strut and moralise at a press conference when Elena is finally felled \u2013 having himself switched allegiances to El Azul along with his contact, Lado. The role is in part shaped by a former DEA agent Stone hired called Eddie, who had \"30 years experience. He was in the Middle East and he knew the scene in Mexico. I got into the DEA that way \u2013 Eddie took care of us; and getting that kind of insight into the DEA is a big deal.\"</p> <p>Lado is a credible character who \"wants to be an American\", says Stone. \"He takes his kids to little league, his wife worries that he's out last thing at night with his 'gardening business' \u2013 his cover, and of course he has other women. He comes in one night, and she can smell a woman on him and he takes her apart, he rapes her \u2013 but we had to let that scene go.\"</p> <p>Lado \"also has eight or nine chihuahuas at his feet\", observes Stone, and it is a detail to relish though the scene was cut: \"I've been to a couple of these drug lords' places\", he says, \"and it's like ocelots to them. They've got all these hairless chihuahuas, proud of the fact that 'they cost me a fucking fortune'.\"</p> <p>Stone's conclusion focuses less on the economic backdrop in Mexico than the failure of the war on drugs. Stone of course takes this further, entwining his themes. First: \"That border is going all day and all night long. And it's 2,000 miles long. There's no way they're going to stop this. Dammit \u2013 they tried to build a wall across Berlin!\" He gestures out of the window towards Starbucks, where no-man's land used to be: \"Walls don't work, period.\" And second: \"I don't see anything coming out of this so far as the war on drugs is concerned. It's been 40 years now, and its just become a method by which more money can be generated to fight what they now call narco-terror.\" And here's the crux, the entwinement again: \"Drugs and terror, they couple them together, and the drug war becomes part of the war on terror that never ends. Part of the total terror that is overcoming our lives.\"</p> <p>Apart from connections to the Middle East already made, it is impossible to continue in this vein without invoking <em>South of the Border</em> \u2013 indeed it is impossible to discuss any Stone film in isolation from the others.</p> <p><em>South of the Border</em> is a documentary series of interviews with those who are bringing Latin America to a new critical mass, a shift in power vis-a-vis the United States. All of them are elected, leftwing presidents of countries that have been, as Stone puts it, \"in Uncle Sam's backyard\", but which now brandish a new self-confidence, after decades of American puppet regimes: N\u00e9stor and Cristina Kirchner of Argentina, Luiz In\u00e1cio da Silva of Brazil, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Paraguay's Fernando Lugo and, famously, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela.</p> <p>In January 2008, Stone's audacious recent history on the theme of <em>South of the Border</em> began in this newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/06/film.usa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">with an interview he gave</a> the <em>Observer</em> in Bogot\u00e1 in which Stone refused to condemn the Farc guerrillas, with whom he was trying to negotiate the release of three hostages. With him were N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. \"I remember it well!\" he half-laughs now. \"I was on a mission. I wanted to stay low key. N\u00e9stor was there, and Hugo, and the American Red Cross, flying into this shithole of a town. Anyway, the Red Cross helicopter arrives, and, well, it was called off. The Farc people are always wary of the CIA, and I think the Americans just couldn't have Hugo involved in anything that would be a success \u2013 the hostages were released shortly afterwards, after Hugo had gone.\"</p> <p>He reflects now on the wider theme: \"The numbers don't lie. These are countries which have seen growth and real improvements after being failed by neo-liberal economics. The US took the side of the bad guys constantly \u2013 the media covering up so many of the abuses, in Argentina, Chile \u2026 But now, for the first time, these countries have thrown off the stranglehold of the International Monetary Fund and US treasury, which made loans the terms of which were those of what they call the 'neo-liberal Washington consensus' \u2013 [to] not only pay back the loans, but conform their economies to the privatisation of the kind we have here: hospitals, military, prisons. Well, in South America, privatisation did not work, it had disastrous consequences.</p> <p>\"And what they essentially did in the last 10&#xa0;years was to throw off that tyranny. Their people have suffered so much, and they voted in new leaders. But even after they were elected, these people were resented by the US. I've never read one positive word about anything these people have done in the US media \u2013 let's face it, the Americans don't accept the idea of the election of leftwing leaders in their own backyard.\"</p> <p>Accordingly: \"Each one of these leaders has been picked off, one by one, by the United States&#xa0;\u2026 Disunite them, break them off from each other. But they've stood firm, and I think this is an important moment. They've done good for their countries, and I hope they last.\"</p> <p>There is a connection between <em>Savages</em> and another Stone film, in fact two of them: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89165/wall.street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street</em></a> and its recent sequel, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135251/wall-street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</em></a>. Chon and Ben have a money-launderer, a finance geek who has left the big bank for whom he worked. In real life, however, we now know that this would be no freelancer; this would be the man from the bank itself, in suit and tie, protected all the way to the top. The scandal and outrage of major high street banks laundering Mexican drug cartel money has made headlines recently: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/17/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate\" title=\"\">American Wachovia and British HSBC</a> were the first to be named and shamed \u2013 with more on the way \u2013 but the typical fines in such cases fall well short of proper punishment.</p> <p>The banks' direct connections to the cartels' bloody war and the misery of drugs inevitably causes Stone to reflect on his two films about what was once his father's business, in those distant days when, he says \"a bank was something that you saved with, and gave you a loan\". He says of the money-laundering: \"You kind of get a sense of where the real power lies. Gekko [his character in <em>Wall Street</em>] was an 1980s creature. But by 2008-9, the banks had changed. What Gekko was doing in the 1980s, everyone was doing \u2013 rigging things, fixing things \u2013 the outsider Gekko had become the system. Look at them! Making money with the money they took from the public, and gambling with it! You have these huge settlements, with AIG underwriting Goldman Sachs \u2013 and it's all over New York, that level of confidence, that level of arrogance and impunity. You go to the Hamptons, and you feel it.\" And there is an inevitable connection between this financial elite and the corporatisation of government.</p> <p>\"The United States,\" he says, \"has been a corporate-controlled country increasingly since world war two. The concept of a national security state plays into that concept of us as a mega-corporation. I view the Pentagon as essentially a huge corporation. The United States has moved into corporate gridlock, and the gridlock controls us \u2013 the power of the lobbyists, banks, oil companies, pharmaceuticals \u2026 After Reagan triumphed in 1980, we had this embrace of the free market. But it's not a free market really, it's fixed. Because monopolies tend to dominate it, they come to the fore and push everybody out of the way. So it's a rigged playing field, like we saw in 2008 \u2013 the banks getting bigger and bigger.</p> <p>\"And you know the weird thing?\" he asks, as if to the street below, those around the Brandenburg Gate. \"Everyone wants to buy into that shit! The people take their cue from whoever has the power and the money! Go into the Four Seasons in New York, and power is the hero! No one wanted to talk about the poor Vietnamese when this all started, or the poor people in Latin America \u2013 no, we embrace power!\"</p> <p>He goes on: \"I don't think Americans give a shit about out there. They don't understand why in the Middle East everyone hates America. They don't understand the 'backyard'. JFK did, and so did Henry Wallace when he was vice-president. They both tried to turn it round \u2013 and what happened? As soon as JFK was assassinated, Lyndon Johnson said he'd crank it up in Vietnam. In Latin America it was: 'Enough of this Alliance for Progress' shit, what about the $9bn we've got invested down there?'\"</p> <p>Which brings Stone to another subject he wants to talk about; for it never rains, it only pours with this tempest of a man. As <em>Savages</em> premieres, get ready \u2013 at the end of this month \u2013 for the publication of his book and thereafter the 10-part television series (to be shown in Britain next year) on which it is based, <em>The Untold History of the United States</em>. Working with the American University historian Peter Kuznick, Stone has compiled a series which, he says \"is inspired by your British series <em>The World at War</em> \u2013 pure narrative, no talking heads and actors to portray some of the players. Ten one-hour programmes; everything's been fact-checked and now CBS has a copy. It's an unorthodox, true global story about America. About how Truman did not have to drop the atomic bomb that all the kids get taught was dropped to save lives and stop the war. That isn't why it happened, it was so that the world would become a huge amphitheatre for America. It's about the true origins of the cold war, which we all think was started by the Russians when they invaded eastern Europe (he gestures towards the window again, sun glinting off an S-Bahn train trundling through the glorious iron-and-glass station at Friedrichstrasse \u2013 not long ago, the overground platforms were in East Berlin; the underground ones were an interchange for the West Berlin U-Bahn system).</p> <p>\"It's about Truman after the war, a small man, a cold warrior and a political hack. After the war, we tried to demobilise, but it didn't last long. They created this legacy of rightwingers who pulled at this alarm that we were falling behind the Russians. But the Russians never achieved anything like parity \u2013 maybe at the end of the 1970s, but it broke them.\"</p> <p>This is not history for history's sake, however \u2013 this is the history of our present and future, long beyond cold war, into war on terror, war on drugs: \"It's the history,\" says Stone, \"of our building the national security state, which is interested in nobody's security apart from that of the state. Always supposedly falling behind the enemy, so there would be no end to it. It's a legacy thing,\" he pleads, almost. \"The American history our kids are reading is all upside down. Everything is the opposite to what you think.\" With Stone, a conversation can only return to the beginning \u2013 in the best sense \u2013 \"because it is all interconnected\", as are his films. But there is not time \u2013 though he does afford himself a valedictory thought that sends a shiver down the spine.</p> <p>\"This terror that we're supposed to be so terrified of \u2026 What the fuck is it? Why should we all be so scared? Well, there's big money in it, for sure. So now we have every form of technology at the disposal of the government and its war on terror \u2013 but who are we supposed to be terrified of? <em>Why</em> must we be so terrified?\" For want of any further answers to his terrifying rhetorical question about being terrified of terror, Stone affords himself a joke, for like all good heretics, he is a jester too, at the court of America: \"Jeezus!\" He swallows a small bowl of salad dressing, neat, and rises from his chair. \"The idea that the government is doing all this to protect <em>me</em> from <em>marijuana</em>!?\"</p> <p><em>Savages was released on 21 September.

  "<p>Two large crude oil spills from Shell pipelines in the Niger delta four years ago have still not been cleaned up by the company despite an outcry by the UN, Amnesty International and the Nigerian government about pollution in the area.</p> <p>Shell, which made \u00a319.1bn profit last year, accepted responsiblity and pledged to fully restore the damage done by spills from its rusting pipelines near the Ogoni village of Bodo in 2008.</p> <p>But an assessment has found only small pilot schemes were started and the most contaminated areas around Bodo and the Gokana district of Ogoniland remain untouched. The impoverished Ogoni fishing and farming communities say they still cannot return to work and have received no compensation. They have accused Shell of applying different standards to clean-ups in Nigeria compared with the rest of the world.</p> <p>\"A comprehensive clean-up is yet to get under way and the creeks remain extremely polluted,\" said Martyn Day of the London-based law firm Leigh Day, which represents the 11,000 affected villagers. Day has just returned from the delta, where he was part of a team assessing the clean-up. \"Next to nothing has happened and where work has commenced it has been totally amateurish.\"</p> <p>Shell said it had started pilot clean-up schemes in five affected areas, but claimed it had been refused access to several other polluted sites. It said \"good progress\" had been made, adding that the vast majority of oil spilt in the Bodo area was the result of criminal activity including theft, sabotage and illegal oil refining by villagers.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria said: \"SPDC is committed to cleaning up all spills, no matter what the cause, from its facilities. The real tragedy of the Niger delta is the widespread and continual criminal activity, including sabotage, theft and illegal refining, that leads to the vast majority of oil being spilled. It is this criminality which blights the Niger delta and which all organisations with an interest in Nigeria's future should focus their efforts on highlighting and dealing with.\"</p> <p>Amnesty International disputed Shell's reason for delaying the clean-up. Audrey Gaughran, interim Africa programme director, said: \"Shell says the oil pollution visible at Bodo today is due to sabotage, and not the two major spills of 2008, which it accepts were due to leaks in its pipeline. But there is no evidence to support Shell's statement.</p> <p>\"Amnesty International has shared with Shell all of our evidence \u2013 including video footage, photos, satellite images taken over relevant time periods. By contrast, although we have asked Shell for evidence to support their claim of sabotage, they have never responded.\"</p> <p>Last year Ogoni chiefs demanded Shell put in \"a serious level\" of resources and appoint an internationally known clean-up company to oversee the pro-cess. But Shell has said it would use its own contractors and has proposed to phase in the clean-up over several years. It has now appointed its own monitor.</p> <p>Day said: \"Shell seems to be trying to undertake the clean-up on the cheap which will mean the people will be left with the aftermath for generations.\"</p> <p>Best practice requires all oil recovered to be stored in temporary facilities until it can be disposed of properly. Instead, surface oil has been poured into pits and covered with sand. Local communities say Shell's contractors have so far failed in a number of respects including cleaning mangrove forests and refusing to employ local labour. They say buried polluted soil next to the shoreline is already leaking.</p> <p>Following a three-year peer-reviewed study funded by Shell, the UN environment programme reported last year that oil pollution on the delta was worse than expected. It urged a $1bn clean-up of the whole region.</p> <p>Shell has still not agreed financial compensation for the 11,000 people affected.</p>",
  "<p>Eleven million workers will start being automatically enrolled in pension schemes from 1&#xa0;October as part of a scheme to ensure everybody has enough money to live on in retirement.</p> <p>Anyone who is aged 22 or over, earning more than \u00a38,105 a year and has been employed for three months or more will be made a member of either their employer's existing occupational pension scheme or an alternative scheme chosen by their employer. The scheme is being phased in over five years, starting with the UK's biggest companies and culminating with those that have just one or two members of staff. The amounts of money involved will be increased gradually to prevent contribution-shock \u2013 but by October 2018, all employees must contribute at least 4% of earnings, their employer will contribute 3% and they will receive a further 1% in tax relief.</p> <p>Pensions minister Steve Webb predicts that about a third of those who are auto-enrolled will later opt out, but adds: \"If we can get 7.5 million people in an employer contributory scheme, that will be incredible.\" He's right: it means that millions of people who might otherwise have nothing to live on but the basic state pension topped up with benefits will have a private pension to boost their standard of living when they retire.</p> <p>The introduction of auto-enrolment has spurred debate about how to invest employees' money to get the best returns.</p> <p>For employers who do not want to set up their own scheme, there are low-cost options available. The government has developed a scheme \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/NestWeb/public/NESTforSavers/contents/charges-explained.html\" title=\"\">Nest</a> \u2013 which can be used by all employers, including the smallest with just one or two members of staff who might otherwise struggle to find a provider to take them on. Nest has an annual management charge of just 0.3%, but investors must pay a charge of 1.8% on every contribution. However, the scheme limits the amount you can invest to stop it being in competition with commercial fund managers.</p> <p>The not-for-profit <a href=\"http://thepeoplespension.co.uk/employees/what-is-the-peoples-pension/what-happens-to-my-money-as-i-approach-retirement/#.UFheOr9y9E4\" title=\"\">People's Pension</a>, formerly the B&amp;CE pension scheme, has extended its potential membership from those in the construction industry to all companies from any industry. It has an annual management charge of 0.5% \u2013 very low by the standards of most British schemes \u2013 and no charge for contributions, switching funds or transfers.</p> <p>ATP, a quasi-mutual from Denmark, has also established a not-for-profit scheme \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/01/state-pension-scheme-ats?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Now: Pensions</a> \u2013 targeting the UK auto-enrolment market. This charges \u00a318 a year for administration, plus a 0.3% annual management charge, but does not yet have an investment track record.</p> <p>Morrisons, the supermarket chain, is replacing its existing defined contribution scheme with a new scheme on 1 October, which will guarantee the size of pension fund its staff will have at retirement. The company hopes the enhancement will encourage staff to stay with the firm.</p> <p>But investors would benefit from much bigger pensions if their money was invested in huge \"collective\" defined-contribution pension schemes, according to research by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). The collective approach \u2013 which is common in Denmark and the Netherlands \u2013 allows economies of scale and enables investors to pool their risk and draw an income directly from the pension fund, rather than buying an expensive annuity.</p> <p>In the RSA's report, <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/tomorrows-investors\" title=\"\">Collective Pensions in the UK</a>, David Pitt-Watson, author and director of pension fund manager Hermes, said the combination of these improvements could boost a pensioner's income by nearly 40%.</p> <p>Pension investors are currently offered one of two types of scheme. Defined benefit schemes \u2013 typically offered to public sector employees \u2013 base the income you receive on either your final salary, or an average of the amount you have earned throughout your career. The income is paid directly from the fund, and all the risk of making sure there is enough in the scheme to pay your pension income is placed on the employer. The cost has proved too high for many providers, including the government, and they have either negotiated changes to reduce the benefits paid by the schemes or closed them altogether.</p> <p>They have been replaced by money purchase or defined contribution (DC) schemes. Here the income you receive is based on the amount collected in your individual pension fund, and is usually converted into an income through the purchase of an insurance contract called an annuity. The eventual pension income resulting from this type of scheme is unknown, placing all the risk of ensuring a sufficient pension income on the employee. The Nest scheme is run the same way.</p> <p>However, a \"collective\" defined contribution scheme enables savers to share risks \u2013 both of longevity and stock market fluctuations. This means the scheme can aim for a target pension benefit paid directly from the fund, rather than through the purchase of an annuity.</p> <p>Pitt-Watson says these schemes provide better returns, partly because they are low cost to administer. He quotes a study of Dutch pension schemes showing that while charges for a collective DC scheme were on average 0.15% of total assets, the average charges for an individual DC scheme were 1.27%. Even this small difference can have a huge effect on performance over time: the report calculates that a 1% difference in charges over 60 years can make a 50% difference in the pension income paid out.</p> <p>Performance is also improved by the pooling of risk and the fact that members do not have to buy an annuity. In the run-up to retirement, individual DC schemes are run more conservatively than collective schemes, with most of the investor's money being switched into bonds and cash. This is to ensure the investor does not lose large amounts in a stock market crash just before stopping work. But the downside is that the investor misses out on any growth if stock markets perform well.</p> <p>The report says the investor loses a further 25p in the pound when buying an annuity: this goes on costs, charges and reserves set aside by the annuity provider. The result is that a quarter of their potential retirement income will disappear overnight.</p> <p>Pitt-Watson believes it is already possible to operate such schemes in Britain: \"UK law allows us to provide much more productive pensions than are currently on offer, and millions of people can be provided with a better retirement income at lower cost.\"</p> <p>However, some experts are sceptical, pointing to problems with collective DC schemes in the Netherlands. According to the Netherlands Central Bank, 261 Dutch pension funds, with 5.1 million active members and 2.5 million retirees, faced funding deficits at the end of November 2011. Those with a funding gap of more than 2% of pension liabilities \u2013 some 40% of the schemes \u2013 have had to cut payouts to pensioners by 1% to 7% this year. This follows previous cuts of up to 12% about 18 months ago, according to Andy Cheseldine, partner with employee benefits specialist LCP.</p> <p>Research by his firm has found that one in four funds has total charges in excess of 1%, and projected incomes are being overestimated by up to 25%.</p> <p>He says that while there is a wide variety of collective DC schemes, the worst are structured like with-profits funds, based on a cross-subsidy from younger contributing members to protect the benefits of older members already drawing an income, and rely very heavily on an actuary making the right decisions. \"The actuary must be able to resist pressure not to cut benefits 'because it will all come right in the end',\" he says.</p> <p>Despite the problems, the government is interested in target or \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/19/defined-ambition-pensions-dutch\" title=\"\">defined ambition</a>\" pensions, consulting the industry about how collective DC could work in the UK.

  "<p>Steven Gerrard sits down knowing it is going to be a difficult, emotional interview. He speaks as captain of Liverpool Football Club but he is here, too, as a grieving relative and it is never going to be easy opening up, or finding the words to describe something that is so deeply harrowing and involves him so personally. The past couple of weeks have brought it all flooding back but, as Gerrard says, he thinks about it every day anyway. Every time he drives into Anfield, his eyes are drawn to the Hillsborough memorial. He sees the 96 names and he knows that the youngest of them is his cousin Jon-Paul Gilhooley. \"The same as me,\" Gerrard says, when asked to describe Jon-Paul. \"A Liverpool fan from a council estate. Loved his footy, kicking around in the street. Same as me, just a year older.\" Jon-Paul was 10.</p> <p>Twenty-three years on, Gerrard has not been able to read the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, and probably never will. The basic details are enough: that it was a cover-up, an orchestrated smear campaign that goes to the top of the country and constitutes a scandal of the worst form. He knows now \u2013 and this is the first point at which he lowers his eyes and his voice trails off \u2013 that South Yorkshire police tested Jon-Paul and all the other corpses for alcohol levels. But the rest? He is frightened what else he might find out. \"That's the reason why I don't want to read it. It's too difficult, for my family and all the families. It's all over the papers, all over the TV. It brings it all back.\"</p> <p>Gerrard watched the tragedy unfold on television, staring at the pictures in disbelief. He remembers the knock on the front door at half past eight the next morning and running downstairs to undo the lock. More than anything, he remembers the look on his grandfather's face as he walked through the door without saying a word. \"Grandad Tony\" was the first to find out. The sentence that shaped Gerrard's childhood was: \"I've got bad news \u2026 Jon-Paul is dead.\"</p> <p>Liverpool play Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday and Gerrard hopes something can change now, that the supporters of the two clubs will accept that songs about the Hillsborough and Munich tragedies go beyond the line. That is essentially why he has chosen to talk, to spread the message that it is not acceptable and to try to foster a better relationship between the clubs.</p> <p>Gerrard, together with Nemanja Vidic, will release 96 red balloons before the kick-off. As captain, he will urge Luis Su\u00e1rez to recognise the importance of the occasion by shaking Patrice Evra's hand and bringing some form of closure to what happened last season. \"Those two players could be the key. The handshake is at the beginning of the match and they've got a responsibility to start the day off on a good note. I will speak to Su\u00e1rez and my advice will be to shake hands and move on. Su\u00e1rez will make his own decision. Of course he will. But I'd like to think he would want to move on&#xa0;himself.\"</p> <p>There are, after all, bigger issues at play here. \"I've stood on the Kop many times when it was terraced. I've been involved at games like that [Hillsborough]. It could have been me. It could have been anyone. We're talking about a disaster that puts everything else into&#xa0;perspective.\"</p> <p>There are moments, such as when he contemplates that Jon-Paul would be 33 now, that Gerrard's suffering is plain to see and he nods or uses his eyes, rather than words, to express his feelings. The past fortnight has been a source of pride, vindication and relief, but never joy. \"Mixed emotions, really,\" he says. \"Delighted with the breakthrough that, at last, it's come out and that people not just in this country but around the world now know exactly how it came about. But on the other hand it brings back all the memories. When you're a Liverpool fan and Liverpool player and you've got family who were affected in the disaster it brings it all back. So sadness at the same time.\"</p> <p>Anger, too. Does he want the people responsible punished? \"I think everyone \u2013 I'm sure you are the same \u2013 does. If there are people out there who should be punished and deserve to be punished. It's not in my control. But I hope so, yes.\"</p> <p>He is talking in a room at Liverpool's training ground where one wall carries the Johan Cruyff quote: \"There's not one club in the world so united with the fans.\" Yet the response outside Anfield has been overwhelming, too. \"Unbelievable,\" Gerrard says. \"First and foremost, across the park, at Everton. Everyone knows the rivalry we've got. But the tribute they put on the other night [before the game against Newcastle] was fantastic.</p> <p>\"It's brought football together. There was a similar togetherness between Liverpool and Everton with the Rhys Jones case [the 11-year-old Everton fan who was murdered in 2007] and I think it's brilliant. It goes to show there are rivalries in football, there is banter and that football is important but that disasters and deaths do put it into&#xa0;perspective.\"</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has appealed for United supporters to refrain from any of the distasteful songs that have been heard from the away end at Anfield. Vidic has said the same. Sandy Busby, Sir Matt's son, too. For their part, Brendan Rodgers and various other Liverpool representatives have called for an end to chants about the Munich air disaster. \"Let's have it right, it's not every supporter out there,\" Gerrard says. \"It's a minority but people do jump on the back of it and if you're a supporter at this game and hear a whisper or someone starts making these kind of noises, then you've got a responsibility to tell the person next to you not to go down that road.</p> <p>\"I'm sure the Liverpool and Manchester United fans know what the right thing to do is. There's a big game of football and a lot at stake at the weekend. But this is more important than football, what we're talking about. We all love football because of these rivalries. That can't stop. But there's a line.\"</p> <p>He does not want to preach, just make the point that maybe Liverpool and United supporters have more in common than they ordinarily care to admit. \"I'm hoping human decency breaks out. It's set up for it. It's a great opportunity for both sets of fans to put the sick chants to bed on both sides. Not just because of the last couple of weeks, but because it's&#xa0;not right.\"</p> <p>He is encouraged by the behaviour of Manchester City fans when they went to Old Trafford in the 50th anniversary week of the Munich disaster in 2008. \"I watched that game on television. It was touching. That was good, that was nice. This is another occasion to do something similar. Alex Ferguson, Brendan Rodgers and Nemanja Vidic have all spoken about it and if I can reiterate that message, not just to the United fans but to the Liverpool fans, it would be a great occasion for that to happen.</p> <p>\"These are not the only two disasters that have happened. There's racism going on. There are all kinds of different chants coming from supporters which needs to stop, and if two big clubs send out the right message that it has no place in football everyone else will take note. If it's a fantastic match, there's a handshake before the game and there's no vile chanting, it will be a great advert to everyone around the world. There's going to be millions and millions of people watching this.\"</p> <p>Liverpool's supporters will hold up coloured boards on three sides of the ground \u2013 the Anfield Road End, the Centenary Stand and the Kop \u2013 to form a mosaic spelling \"96, Justice and The Truth\". Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton will lay floral tributes. Kenny Dalglish, who worked so tirelessly to support the Hillsborough families, will be at Anfield and Gerrard knows how deeply the past two weeks will have affected the club's former manager. \"It will be an emotional day for Kenny. He played a massive part in supporting all the families. It must have been a difficult 10 days for Kenny, with all the memories flooding back for him as well. But I'm sure he will be saying exactly the same thing as me. I'm sure he will looking forward to the game, hoping that it's a good game and that everyone in the crowd behaves themselves and that it is remembered for what happens on the pitch.\"</p> <p>As for Gerrard, the task is to separate the emotions surrounding the match with the professionalism and focus that is needed once the whistle blows. \"I'm fine,\" he says. \"You focus on the game and the job you have to do. When the game starts, all the emotions of the past 10 days \u2026 you park them and try to do your job to win the game.</p> <p>\"It's a great opportunity for us to win our first game in the league and kickstart the season. We've been inconsistent in the opening four games \u2013 fantastic against Manchester City and Sunderland, very disappointing against West Brom and Arsenal. If we were to take maximum points, it would give us big confidence and the bit of a kickstart we need.\"</p> <p>This, however, is far more than just an ordinary Liverpool-United fixture. \"This game is about two tremendous teams. It's a big clash. It's an important game. I want to try to focus on what's going to happen on the pitch. I don't want to go into the game thinking about what Luis and Evra are going to do, or what's going to be chanted on the terraces.</p> <p>\"The game's on TV, everyone's waiting to see what kind of reaction it gets and it's an opportunity for the Liverpool fans and the Manchester United fans to send a message across the world that they're great sets of supporters who know this is the chance to stop that kind of chanting.</p> <p>\"Liverpool players and Manchester United players are not all of a sudden going to start liking each other. That's fine but we're talking about disasters that have affected both clubs. It's got to stop.\"</p>",
  "<p>Clair Beattie, who lives in Nottingham and works part-time as a hairdresser, looks back to her parents' generation and wishes things could be like that now.</p> <p>Her father had a good profession: he was a builder who brought home a decent wage. Her father-in-law, working in the same trade, owned his own company. His prosperity meant his family owned their own house and went away every year on holiday. \"Our parents' generation definitely seemed to have had an easier time,\" she says. \"There were more jobs, better wages and it was easier to get on the housing ladder.\"</p> <p>By contrast, Clair and her husband Dan struggle. They don't complain too much, largely because they have two lovely daughters \u2013 one four and the other 17 \u2013 as well as an 18-year-old son who has left the family home. But life is tough. Dan's expertise is in air conditioning and because there are few jobs in that field in Nottingham he works 50 to 60 hours in London every week.</p> <p>They don't own their own home and half of their joint income of around \u00a330,000 a year goes on rent and council tax. Clair would love the family to buy their own house but sees no hope because prices are so high and money is too tight. \"If childcare was cheaper, I would be able to work more and make a greater contribution to the family budget,\" she says. \"That would make it easier to buy a house.\"</p> <p>She has also thought of re-training for a new career that would better suit her family's needs, but that route seems blocked too. \"I qualified as a hairstylist after finishing school. Since then I have looked into re-training for a career in education, but the cost of the training is more than we can afford.\"</p> <p>Nowadays Clair and Dan just concentrate on getting by, rather than looking forward. \"We can't look beyond the next payday. I can't even think of my children growing up and needing more. I have to deal with what they need this month. We're stuck in a rut.\"</p> <p>She adds: \"I look around and it's hard to see signs of hope. A neighbour's son went to university and hasn't worked in a year.\"</p> <p>Today a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Institute for Employment Research for the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">independent Resolution Foundation</a> highlights how Dan and Clair, and millions of others like them, are victims of changes in the UK jobs market which \u2013 coupled with current policy on tax, benefits and other issues \u2013 are fast creating a Britain of two halves: those in the bottom 50% whose living standards are on the slide, and those in the top half who can look forward to better prospects in the future.</p> <p>The heart of the problem, the study points out, is that traditional well-paid skilled jobs, such as those in manufacturing and administration, have given way to low-skilled, low-wage jobs in the retail, caring, leisure and service industries. Coupled with government policies that offer limited childcare and vocational training, the ability of people to find escape routes out of what Clair calls a \"rut\" is limited, and the outlook for low to middle income households is bleak. These days large swaths of the \"squeezed middle\" \u2013 to use Ed Miliband's phrase \u2013 are in danger of becoming part of a \"vanishing middle\".</p> <p>So serious is the situation, the report says, that even in a rosy scenario in which healthy levels of economic growth return between now and 2020 the bottom 50% of households would still see their living standards decline steadily between now and the end of this decade. Whereas previous generations assumed their children would be better off than they were, the reverse is becoming the case.</p> <p>The further down the income scale one goes, the sharper the decline becomes. Some of the lowest-income families, the report says, are projected to see real-term drops in their living standards of around 15% by 2020 as benefit cuts and changes to the tax system \u2013 including a move to link future rises in tax credits and benefits to the lower consumer price index of inflation rather than the retail prices index \u2013 bite.</p> <p>By contrast, the report finds the future for the top 50% of earners looking far brighter. It estimates that between now and 2020 some 2m more jobs will be created in high-paid professional and managerial occupations. In short, in income terms, a divided, polarised country is taking shape in which low earners are increasingly hard-pressed and increasingly numerous, the well-heeled continue to flourish and pull away from their unluckier contemporaries, and the ranks of those on middle incomes shrink inexorably.</p> <p>As the party conference season opens, with Lib Dems meeting in Brighton this weekend, the report is political dynamite that should blow apart many of the current debates on policy. It puts firmly into context grandiose claims by the Liberal Democrats to be delivering \"fairness\" in austere times, in one fell swoop, by lifting two million people out of income tax.</p> <p>More broadly, it raises fundamental issues about how fairness really can be delivered in a meaningful way. Up to now the predominant political argument between Labour and the coalition parties in this parliament has been over the delivery of economic growth, as if growth were the panacea. Labour's Ed Balls has argued that coalition spending cuts should be slowed and that a burst of Keynesian pump-priming is the way to revive the economy. The coalition, on the other hand, says the credibility of the UK economy in the eyes of the markets rests upon cutting the deficit, hard and fast, and this is the route back to growth.</p> <p>But \u2013 particularly for Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who put fairness and the interests of low earners at the heart of their message \u2013 this study should change the game. It makes clear that, even with healthy levels of growth, inequality will go on widening if the current thrust of policy stays the same. The study assumes average annual economic growth of 1.9% from 2011 to 2015 and 2.5% from 2015 to 2020 \u2013 figures more optimistic than the latest projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p> <p>In other words, the guiding assumption of British politicians during the postwar generations \u2013 that a growing economy will automatically provide the jobs and opportunities to allow all social classes to prosper \u2013 is no longer adequate to the times. Without fundamental moves to address the collapse in what used to be called white-collar employment, and without a strategy to engage those whose fathers would once have found skilled work in manufacturing, growing numbers of Britons will be excluded from future good times.</p> <p>It does not take a sociologist to recognise that the implications for social cohesion are huge. Last summer's riots and looting in the streets of English cities offered a vivid illustration of what can happen when disaffected sections of the population go their own way.</p> <p>So Labour and the Lib Dems will need to focus hard on the suggestions this report makes for addressing the crisis \u2013 because a return to growth, though vital, will not on its own be enough. Although it does not put forward precise policy suggestions, it makes clear that, if progress were to be made in three key areas, the incomes of typical middle income households would be \u00a31,600 higher in 2020 than under the current policy path.</p> <p>The first is to raise female employment to the level of the best-performing member countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This would mean developing more generous childcare systems like those in Denmark and Sweden. The second is to raise skills and training in the bottom half of the workforce \u2013 something that could only be achieved by a new and costly focus on vocational training. And, third, it suggests boosting wages for the lowest paid in a way that would have an effect equivalent to that seen when the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. Only by doing all three together, the report says, will the policy mix combine effectively to have a substantial positive effect on raising incomes at the bottom end.</p> <p>Until government moves in that direction, Clair and Dan will have to continue relying on their parents for help to get by and for money to get away from the struggle of everyday life. \"This year my father-in-law paid for a family holiday which we could not afford otherwise. We rely on them quite a bit,\" she says.</p>",
  "<p>Gianfranco Zola said he was afraid for his heart as his side played high-tempo, attractive football to earn a 2-2 draw in a thrilling game against Bristol City at Vicarage Road on Saturday. At times the Italian's latest managerial project appeared shaky in defence and Watford could easily have conceded a fourth defeat on the trot that would have brought the unwanted tag of being the club's worst start to a season in six years.</p> <p>An own goal from Jamie Wilson \u2013 accidentally tapping in Marco Cassetti's superb cross \u2013 gave Watford the lead in the second half as Troy Deeney, making his first appearance since a stint in prison for affray, put the defender under pressure in the box. Marvin Elliott levelled the scores four minutes later but Watford once more forged ahead with a beautifully worked goal from the Czech internationals Daniel Pudil and Matej Vydra, the latter earning his fourth goal for the club, before Steven Davies nicked a point for City in the final stages. On the pitch for Watford such a medley of nationalities, signings and loan stars was quite a sight to behold. The club have undergone major changes since the Pozzo family became the new owners in July for a fee of \u00a315m.</p> <p>Under the previous manager, Sean Dyche, Watford had been a close-knit side with largely British players and operated on a shoestring budget; widely tipped to be relegated last season he confounded all expectation in leading the team to an 11th place finish. Under the new management Watford could not look more different: boasting 42 players from 14 different nationalities, the squad are so large that in training they split into three groups. But the changes have proved difficult to adapt to and with three league defeats on the trot all pre-season talk of promotion to the Premier League was put on hold.</p> <p>Not only are there new personalities around the training ground \u2013 and the addition of mozzarella and prosciutto to the lunchtime menu \u2013 but a unique football philosophy combining financial prudence with a shrewd approach in the transfer market. To keep the accounts in check the Pozzos recruit all year round \u2013 shunning the transfer window \u2013 combing lesser known hunting grounds such as Chile and eastern Europe for young players who can be developed and then sold on for a good price.</p> <p>The method has a proven track record \u2013 players such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez, sold for \u00a321m to Barcelona last year, Asamoah Gyan, Stephen Appiah, Oliver Bierhoff and Marcio Amoroso \u2013 have brought in \u00a3100m worth of profit over the last decade.</p> <p>With Udinese, Granada and now Watford, the Pozzos' triumvirate of clubs gives them a wealth of players to circulate. Of Watford's 14 players on loan, 10 are from Udinese and two from Granada. Only Chelsea starlet, the impressive 17-year-old Nathaniel Chalobah, and the Standard Li\u00e8ge winger, Geoffrey Mujangi Bia, are independent of the family empire.</p> <p>The gently greying Zola refused to be downbeat about his prospects at Vicarage Road. \"No it is not a risk to be here,\" he said. \"I'm convinced it's a very good thing for me and I will do my best to make sure it is a good thing for the club as well. It hasn't been easy. This club has gone through a lot of changes, people and players. I understand it's a difficult situation but that's the way it is.\"</p> <p>With such a large influx of foreign players to contend with, the Watford manager was alert to any suggestion that there may be factions or divisions within the squad. \"We're trying to keep good spirits within the camp, that is the most important thing,\" he said. \"This week we will be doing activities to make sure the players bond together. We are all a team here. The thing that everybody has to focus on is not players from one side or from one country or another country: we are all Watford Football Club and we are all going in the same direction.\"</p> <p>But with 40-odd players to keep onside how will he avoid a mutiny? \"It's impossible, you cannot keep everybody happy. You just have to make sure that whatever you decide you do the best for the club. It's impossible with so many players. As long as everybody respects the choices and is professional, that is the most important thing.\"</p>",
  "<p>In theory, Lena Dunham should be out of place amid all the glitz of tonight's Emmy awards. As America's television industry gathers to schmooze in downtown Los Angeles, this explorer of modern women's mishaps, mistakes and neuroses should stick out like a sore thumb.</p> <p>For Dunham, who at just 26 is already a household name among her own generation in America, has risen to fame with her painfully honest explorations of her own life. In her short videos, essays, a feature film and now the hit TV series <em>Girls </em>, Dunham has taken on awkward sex, job failures, losing your virginity, abortion and weight issues in ways both brave and shamelessly autobiographical.</p> <p>While most TV, especially in America, is full of aspirational images of body types and careers, Dunham has tacked furiously in the opposite direction. This is especially true of <em>Girls</em>, which she writes, directs and stars in and which has scooped four Emmy nominations. It chronicles the painful comic adventures of four young women, fresh out of college, as they seek to find their way in New York. Her characters are flawed, their motives confused, their prospects limited.</p> <p>With Dunham playing the lead of Hannah Horvath, the star of the show is not the blonde, thin archetypal female so common in TV land. Instead, it is Dunham's own pale-skinned, brunette, imperfect, humanly flawed frame that is put on display.</p> <p>It will be refreshing to see Dunham on the Emmys red carpet amid the nose jobs, high heels and exquisitely chiselled cheek bones. Whatever one thinks of her privileged New York background and whether she wins or loses an award, Dunham's success represents a breath of fresh air.</p> <p>In many ways, she is there not just for herself, but for the legions of women \u2013 and not a few men \u2013 who have become <em>Girls</em> fans. They revel in and relate to the characters' tribulations, just as a previous generation (and a less fiscally troubled one) caught on to <em>Sex and the City</em>. Dunham once explained Hannah's attraction: \"She is real and complicated and weird and annoying\u2026 the reason she resonates with people is because she feels like a multidimensional woman. She looks like people they might know and she is behaving in ways we can all relate to.\" So as Dunham laps up the plaudits at the Emmys, millions of her fans and viewers will \u2013 in some small way \u2013 feel they, too, are at last being recognised.</p> <p>Yet Dunham is hardly the most obvious choice to step up for the unrepresented. After all, she was born into a life of artistic and material wealth in downtown Manhattan. If Lena as Hannah resonates because people feel they might know her, the chances of anyone outside a small New York social set knowing her for real are fairly small. Her mother is famed photographer Laurie Simmons and her father is the artist Carroll Dunham.</p> <p>Dunham was born in New York on 13 May 1986 and grew up in a succession of loft apartments. First, the family lived on the lower reaches of Broadway, there then followed a brief sojourn in Brooklyn Heights, before returning to Manhattan and a huge, spacious loft in Tribeca, once a warehouse district but now home to a famous film festival, Hollywood stars and Wall Street bankers.</p> <p>Dunham's childhood, as described in numerous interviews, was not exactly normal and suburban. Her liberal parents took her to gallery openings and parties with their famous friends, where she mingled happily with artists, writers and critics. She went to elite Manhattan private schools of the sort designed to encourage wealthy children to express themselves rather than learn multiplication tables.</p> <p>By the age of 12, Dunham found herself at the famed Saint Ann's school where one of her babysitters was fashion designer Zac Posen and a classmate was art dealer Vito Schnabel. It was clear Dunham was not exactly a regular child or at least not regular for anyone outside her own world. She had been in therapy since the age of seven and at Saint Ann's she wrote a play about waiting in an abortion clinic. Her Christmas present when she was 14 was a series of stand-up comedy lessons. (She used them and gave several shows in bars, with her mother acting as chaperone.)</p> <p>But while flourishing artistically, Dunham was no genius at exams. Her final marks did not send her to the Ivy League college that might have beckoned, so she spent a year at New York's the New School and then transferred to the liberal and artistic surroundings of the private Oberlin College in Ohio. It was here that Dunham really emerged. She began shooting videos and short films, putting them online. Often, they were prankish in nature.</p> <p>\"She was like Ali G on campus,\" one friend told the <em>New Yorker</em>. Watching them now, it is almost as if Dunham appeared fully formed. All the Dunham tropes are there: the awkward but honest explorations of young adult themes, the use of friends and family, the wry humour and herself in the starring role. One of the biggest hits was <em>The Fountain</em>, in which Dunham, wearing a bikini, does her morning wash in an Oberlin public fountain. The short got millions of hits with many YouTube commenters weighing in unpleasantly on Dunham's full figure. Eventually, she took it down.</p> <p>But that has been a rare \u2013 if not unique \u2013 moment of Dunham backing off from exposing herself and her insecurities. It is hard to imagine anyone bar the most extreme of performance artists mining her real life for artistic purposes as much as Dunham. Or so repeatedly blurring the boundaries between reality and fiction. Just take her breakout film, <em>Tiny Furniture</em>, which was a low-budget hit in 2010. In it, Dunham, who had just left Oberlin and moved back to New York to live with her artist parents, plays Aura, who has who has just left Oberlin and moved back to New York to live with her artist mother.</p> <p>In the film, Aura's mother is played by Dunham's real mother. Her sister in the film was played by her sister in real life. At one stage, Aura reads from her fictional mother's diary, which was in fact Dunham's mother's real-life diary. Similar stuff happens in <em>Girls</em>. She is friends with many people involved in the show, both behind the scenes and on screen. Many events are taken from her real life and her real social circle. Indeed, the lead credits of <em>Girls</em> read less like the result of a casting call and more like a club for daughters of Manhattan's arts scene. (One is the daughter of newscaster Brian Williams, another's father is playwright David Mamet.)</p> <p>By drawing so heavily on her own social scene for her inspiration, Dunham has faced inevitable accusations of elitism and racism. There's certainly no denying that her work is markedly short of non-white characters or people who are not part of New York's arts and hipster scene. As one critic memorably posted on Twitter: \"I think <em>Tiny Furniture</em> is good but it does represent the cinema of unexamined privilege.\" That is true. But also unfair. Just as you do not have to be a heroin addict to appreciate Irvine Welsh's <em>Trainspotting</em>, you do not have to be a well-off, neurotic yet smart white girl in New York to tap into the emotional depths and mordant wit of <em>Girls</em>. An oft-quoted line from the show appears to make such broad universal claims when Hannah moans to her parents: \"I think I may be the voice of my generation. Or at least a voice of a generation.\"</p> <p>That might be a step too far. But her relentless exploration of the self does seem to fit a modern internet-obsessed generation where old notions of privacy have been replaced by the never-ending sharing of Twitter and Facebook. Dunham's unveiling of her insecurities, dreams and disappointments seems to hit a spot, personal as well as public.</p> <p>Perhaps if she had been born poor, or born black, or born the daughter of dentists, or born in Indiana, she would not have been such a big hit. But Dunham played the lucky cards she was dealt and she has played a blinder. And, even with all her advantages, she still had to get over the biggest obstacle to becoming an on-screen leading lady: she was not born conventionally beautiful.</p> <p>Yet instead of changing that, she celebrated it. \"The parts I enjoy playing aren't really available to me,\" she once said. \"So I have to write them.\" And that is exactly what she did.</p>",
  "<p>Liberal Democrats have overwhelmingly backed Nick Clegg's decision to \"extract a price\" for the Tory revolt over House of Lords reform by blocking plans for Westminster boundary changes.</p> <p>The opening day of the party's five-day annual conference in Brighton and Hove saw delegates line up to condemn the Conservatives for failing to back reform of the Lords as they warned the coalition agreement cannot be \"unpicked at will\" by either side.</p> <p>A motion cementing Clegg's decision by instructing MPs to vote against the proposed boundary changes received huge support from conference delegates.</p> <p>In a swipe at those Lib Dem Lords who oppose reform, the motion also stipulates that future Lib Dem peers will have to sign a pledge saying they support reform before they can go to the Lords.</p> <p>The conference motion strengthens Clegg's hand after he announced in August that he would instruct his MPs to vote against another bill that would have cut the number of MPs by redrawing the constituency boundaries \u2013 a change opposed by many of the 57-strong Lib Dem MPs as it is expected they would lose 15 or more seats as a result \u2013 after proposals for a mainly-elected second chamber were killed following a major rebellion by Tory backbenchers.</p> <p>Alistair Carmichael, Lib Dem chief whip and government deputy chief whip, told the conference Clegg was \"absolutely right\" to take the decision he did in the summer, because being in a coalition meant give and take, with each partner delivering what it had agreed.</p> <p>Had Clegg not acted as he did, the Lib Dems \"would no longer have been partners in a coalition, we would have been prisoners of it\", said Carmichael, as he told delegates to be in \"no doubt\" that when legislation on boundary changes came to the Commons, Lib Dem MPs would vote against it.</p> <p>\"The coalition agreement stands or falls as a whole and it cannot \u2013 and as long as I am chief whip of this party \u2013 it will not be unpicked at will by either side. And that is why Nick is right to extract the price for a breach of contract that he did. And boundary changes are the obvious price for the Conservative backbenchers to pay, not least because they wanted them so much.\"</p> <p>Carmichael described the debacle over the summer as a case of \"I fought the Lords and the Lords won,\" in reference to a song by the Clash.</p> <p>He reserved his harshest criticism for Labour, saying that while he was disappointed \"but not massively surprised\" that elements of the Conservative party had opposed reform, Labour's opposition was \"a disgrace\".</p> <p>\"Resisting progressive is what the Conservatives do. The Conservatives \u2013 the clue is in the title,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If the conduct of the Conservatives was a disappointment, then the conduct of the Labour party was a disgrace. It's quite something when you see the trade unions standing shoulder to shoulder with the hereditary barons. Their opposition to change wasn't based on principle or belief, but sheer partisanship and narrow party interest.\"</p> <p>Duncan Hames, a parliamentary aide to Clegg, said the Tories \"had it coming\".</p> <p>\"Conservative backbenchers were determined to use every parliamentary tactic they could to scupper the Bill and the Labour frontbench were determined to let them.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Tory MPs seemed to think they could break the coalition agreement with impunity. It should have come as no surprise to Tory rebels that we would pull the plug on the boundary review. Let's face it, they had it coming.\"</p> <p>Lord Tyler, co-chair of the party's backbench constitutional committee, accused the Conservatives of betrayal and added that \"the extremist right-wing tail wagged the Tory dog\".</p> <p>He said it would be a scandal if MPs who opposed the reforms ended up taking a seat in the House of Lords . Lord Newby, the party's chief whip in the Lords, said the \"bleak reality\" was that any reform would not get through the Lords and would have to be forced through under the Parliament Act.</p> <p>He told the conference he regretted that \"a handful\" of the 90 Lib Dem peers were opposed to the reforms, but under the amendment the party will ensure all new Lib Dem peers support Lords reform.</p> <p>\"It will be my job to stand over them as they sign the pledge and I will, I can assure you, do so. One day the House of Lords will reform. Our job as a party is to bring that day forward, and our role, as unelected peers, is to be at the forefront of that campaign.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Libyan city of Benghazi was tense after the bodies of six militiamen apparently executed after the storming of a base on the southern outskirts were discovered in a field.</p> <p>The bodies were found the day after crowds marched on three militia bases, including that of Ansar al-Sharia, blamed by many in the city for the murder of the US ambassador, Chris Stevens, earlier this month. Funerals were held for nine protesters killed when crowds tried to force their way into the Rafallah al-Sahati militia base early on Saturday morning.</p> <p>The militia was the only one of three to fire back when demonstrators swarmed over their bases, following a rally on Friday in which 30,000 people vowed to retake the streets of the city.</p> <p>The interior minister, Fawzi Abdul Al, who was criticised for his failure to launch a full investigation of the murder of Stevens and three fellow diplomats, criticised the action of the crowds, saying the militias should have been given more time to incorporate into the official security forces.</p> <p>The mood in Benghazi is one of both triumph and sorrow at the toll of dead and wounded. Mohammed El Kish, whose cousin was killed by a stray bullet more than a mile from the clashes, said: \"He was not even involved in the actions, it is terrible.\"</p> <p>City hospitals were braced for more violence after the Rafallah al-Sahati militia reoccupied its looted base. Several hundred unarmed people gathered outside. \"This is not good, they should not be here. When the funerals have finished there will be trouble,\" said Ashraf Saleh.</p> <p>Police remained in control of the Ansar al-Sharia compound, which is now a looted ruin. A spokesman for Ansar al-Sharia, whose units have dispersed outside the city, insisted they had withdrawn rather than confront protesters \"for reasons of security\".</p> <p>The chaos at the heart of Libya's government remains, with some angry that Rafallah was attacked after it had formally been incorporated into the Libyan army. Such designations are lost on many ordinary Libyans, who say many militias from last year's revolution have simply cut deals with ministries, enabling them to form what are in essence private armies.</p> <p>Washington is likely to draw quiet comfort from the sight of ordinary Libyan civilians confronting jihadists, after a week in which embassies across the Muslim world were firebombed and protests claimed 15 lives in Pakistan. US diplomats in Libya had been at pains not to inflame public opinion, with no criticism of the failure of the Libyan police to launch a full investigation into the killing of Stevens.</p> <p>Nearly two weeks after his death, an FBI team sent to Tripoli has yet to be given permission to travel to Benghazi. The city's chief prosecutor Saleh Adem Mohammed refused to discuss the case, nor confirm reports of four men arrested on suspicion of the killing. \"We are not responsible for what the politicians say.\"</p> <p>Rumours are sweeping Benghazi that one of the two US compounds in the city that came under attack housed a small \"black ops\" unit that had moved to Libya after the rocket attack on the British ambassador in the city in June. The US has yet to explain why some 30 diplomats needed to be evacuated from a consulate that might be expected to have less than half that staff.</p> <p>But as more eyewitness evidence accumulates, it is clear that the attack on the consulate was unprovoked, and that statements from Washington that it grew out of an anti-American protest appear to be false.</p>",
  "<p>There was frustration for Britain's Olympic gold and silver medallists Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley in Saturday's world championship women's road race at Valkenburg in the Netherlands as both riders were unable to match the power of the Olympic champion Marianne Vos and her Dutch team-mates.</p> <p>Pooley was close to Vos when she made her move on the course's main climb with 48km of the 128km race remaining, but she looked to have been blocked by another rider as the Dutchwoman rode away. Vos bridged a gap to an earlier move, whittling that down to a five-strong group of escapees who dominated the latter stages of the race, opening a substantial gap on the main&#xa0;pack.</p> <p>On the final climb Vos sprang away from her companions, crossing the line alone to emulate Cooke, the only woman to have won the world title and Olympic gold in the same year, back in 2008.</p> <p>At the line, Vos had time to snatch a Dutch tricolour from a supporter, waving it high as she clinched the victory from Australia's Rachel Neylan. It was a doubly sweet victory coming as it did after a run of five second places in the event. Pooley crossed the line 15th, 4min 37sec behind Vos.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the British cyclist David Millar, a leading campaigner against doping in the sport, said that the US Anti-Doping Authority's investigation of the seven-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong \"could end up being the best thing for cycling\". He added: \"I really do believe that. It's a positive in the long run. We will no longer have these shadows lurking in the background and this confusion.\"</p> <p>Millar, who was close to Armstrong early in his career, said he did not believe the American would ever confess to using banned substances, in spite of a recent Usada ruling which stripped him of his seven Tour titles.</p> <p>\"It's unfortunate for him,\" said Millar. \"He's too far in. Just the scale of him, the legal problems would be massive. That's sad: he's a phenomenal athlete, no matter what happened. And now he has to live with this for the rest of his life without having it clarified.\"</p> <p>The Scot, a member of the World Anti- Doping Agency's athletes commission, spoke out against calls for an amnesty for cyclists with a doping past. \"If you did something wrong, there needs to be some culpability,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We can't just say: 'Let's draw a line now,' and pretend nothing happened in the past because things happened in the past. We have to accept where we've been and where we are now, that's the only way to move forward.\"</p> <p>Millar, who won a stage in this year's Tour de France, has already finished his season and was present at the world championship to perform commentary duties for the BBC.</p> <p>In Sunday's men's road race Mark Cavendish will wear No1 as the defending champion but has said he does not feel the hilly circuit will suit him; instead, with the Tour de France stars Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome uncertain of their form, the Great Britain coach Rod Ellingworth has said that the team may experiment by backing Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, the recent Tour of Britain winner, who is unproven in a race of this length.</p>",
  "<p>The former home secretary Jack Straw has revealed how he suffered from depression as a result of political tension and illness.</p> <p>In his autobiography, summarised in the Daily Mail, Straw describes how the Labour party was divided by infighting while he developed tinnitus after his election to parliament in 1979.</p> <p>He wrote: \"The deafness seemed a metaphor for what was happening around me. As my hearing fell apart, so did my party, and all the aspirations and dreams I'd had about the future.</p> <p>\"In my own constituency I came under pressure from Trotskyists and other assorted nasties, trying to de-select me. I was in a terrible state, worried about my health and my future.\"</p> <p>Straw felt that a series of emotional problems that he had collected since his childhood came to a head, propelling him into clinical depression. He was advised to seek help which he did.</p> <p>\"Alice's mother (his mother-in-law) provided me with a route out of this darkness. She suggested it might help if I saw a psychoanalyst and a man in Islington was recommended. Although at first I was highly resistant to the idea of anyone prying into my mind, I began going twice a week. It took me a while to recognise the value of what he was trying to do.</p> <p>Whether professional psychoanalysis is for everyone, I have no idea, but it worked for me. \"</p> <p>Straw also writes about seeing his father being beaten up by his maternal uncles and his father's subsequent suicide attempt.</p> <p>He also describes the loss of a daughter and the breakup of his first marriage. \"We had wanted to start a family, but this proved difficult. Anthea had a course of fertility treatment and, to our great joy, became pregnant. The baby was born fit and well in February 1976. We named her Rachel.</p> <p>\"Three days later, she was not feeding properly. She was rushed from the ward to a specialist neonatal unit and given the best treatment available, but she became more and more distressed and died. She was six days old.\"</p> <p>Their daughter's death hastened the couple's separation and Straw married Alice Perkins who worked for the Labour minister Barbara Castle.</p> <p>Straw writes that his hearing improved although he still suffers from tinnitus in his left ear. He also occasionally sees a psychotherapist.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama attacked the Republican party on Saturday, for scrapping a bill that would have established a $1bn scheme to help military veterans get jobs.</p> <p>In his weekly radio address, Obama attacked GOP politicians for failing to pass the planned law before Congress ended its session last week and lawmakers returned to their own states and districts ahead of the 6 November elections.</p> <p>\"These men and women have made incredible sacrifices for our country. They shouldn't have to worry about finding a job when they get home. But last week, Republicans in Congress voted it down. And then they left,\" Obama said.</p> <p>The bill, which had some bipartisan support, would have given job priority to post-9/11 veterans, aiming to put them back to work as firefighters and police officers and in public work projects.</p> <p>Joblessness is a huge problem for many veterans, whose employment prospects are three points below the national average. But Republicans opposed the scheme on the grounds of cutting government expenditure, pointing to several existing schemes aimed at putting ex-military men and women back to work. </p> <p>The law attracted a handful of Republican supporters but fell in the Senate, two votes short of the majority of 60 needed to waive Republican objections.</p> <p>Supporters had modeled the proposal partly after the Civilian Conservation Corps that was used during the Great Depression to employ people to build parks and dams. </p> <p>\"If Congress had done the right thing, we could be on our way to having a veterans' jobs corps that helps returning heroes find work as cops and firefighters in communities all across the country,\" Obama said.</p> <p>The failure of the bill attracted high-profile condemnation from veterans' groups. The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America described the vote as a \"huge disappointment\". </p> <p>Some Democratic activists have already used the vote as a way of attacking potentially vulnerable Republican politicians on the issue of national security. That was a sentiment Obama seemed to echo as he urged people to express their anger as Republicans campaign for re-election. </p> <p>\"If you see them campaigning back home, tell them in person. Because there's been enough talk. It's time for action,\" the president said.</p>",
  "<p>As fires blazed and protesters danced in the ruined compound of a vanquished jihadist militia, I watched as the citizens of the Libyan city of Benghazi staged a dramatic display of raw people power.Numbed by the murder of an American ambassador in their city, furious with jihadist militias lording it over them and frustrated by a government too chaotic and intimidated to react, ordinary Benghazians took matters into their own hands.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the world jihadists staged fiery attacks on foreign targets. In Libya they were sent running by people power. A rally called to Rescue Benghazi on Friday night became the launch pad for a spontaneous retaking of the streets, and more \u2013 a retaking of the soul that saw this city become the cradle of last year's Arab spring revolution.</p> <p>Ansar al-Sharia militia, blamed by many for the killing of ambassador Chris Stevens and three of his diplomats had last week deployed anti-aircraft guns around their Benghazi compound, fearing attack from drones and US warships. But the attack, when it came, was from a very different direction. Civilian. Unarmed. And with nothing more than the desperation of a population staring anarchy in the face.</p> <p>For the people of Benghazi, the killing of Stevens was the final outrage in a campaign of extremist violence that had seen other consulates firebombed, the convoy of Britain's ambassador rocketed, commonwealth war graves vandalised and 14 officials assassinated. As foreign missions fled and businessmen cleared out, Benghazi found itself cast as Libya's Dodge City. And in the absence of a sheriff to impose order, its people staged their own spontaneous cleansing.</p> <p>The rally on Friday was peaceful: crowds of men, women and children marched on central Benghazi, with balloons, flags and placards, many calling for justice for the killers of Stevens. \"We are Islam, we are not extremists!\" they chanted.</p> <p>Ever since the 11 September attack on the US compound that left Stevens and three fellow diplomats dead, Benghazians have been incredulous at the inability of government to act. No serious investigation has been launched to catch his killers, the government cowed by the power of jihadist militias.</p> <p>But support for the protest was everywhere. The defence minister refused to give his backing, but air force pilots made their feelings known: an attack helicopter circled Friday's protest to protect it and a pilot made low thundering passes over the crowd to remind them of the revolutionary slogan: \"The army is with the people.\"</p> <p>When night fell, the dam broke. The women and children of the rally were escorted home and the crowd surged towards militia bases. First to go was the Abu Salem Shahouda militia base, behind the seafront Tibesti hotel, and blamed by locals for thuggery and intimidation. A crowd of hundreds of young men, some teenagers, smashed through the gates and into the compound.</p> <p>I was propelled in with them, as the frightened militiamen were manhandled out of the gates. Minutes later three jeeps loaded with red-capped military police screeched into the compound, weapons ready, unsure what they would find. The protesters embraced them. \"It's like in the revolution,\" said colonel Ben Eisa, taking command of the abandoned Abu Salem Shahouda base. \"We are taking orders from the people.\" It was as easy as that. Months of militia violence ended by a show of unarmed force.</p> <p>Then came Ansar al-Sharia: a 300-strong force blamed by Libya's head of state Muhammad Magariaf for involvement in Stevens's death. As the demonstrators approached, the militiamen flooded out of their compound and loosed volleys of machine gun fire into the air. The crowd, bursting with the frustration of months of humiliation, simply kept coming. The militia, who had vowed to fight American air power, fled before people power.</p> <p>Compound buildings were torched, cars set ablaze and looting of everything not nailed down began as, belatedly, red-capped military police arrived. \"We are in control of this place,\" said colonel Saleh Yemeni, sporting a red beret and the silver wings of the parachute regiment, as a flaming car burned behind him. \"We are with the people.\"</p> <p>A well-built man, Ehad El Farsi, stopped me to ask if I was American and to apologise on behalf of Benghazi for the killing of Stevens. Told I was English, he explained he was a politics professor at Benghazi university and wanted to talk to me some time about the merits of singer Chris Rea. \"What you have here is the people taking action,\" he said. \"All the people.\"</p> <p>TV pictures may give the impression of mob rule. Being there felt it felt more like a cup final crowd toasting victory. Then the cry went up to march on Hwari, the sprawling base of another militia, Raffala al-Sahati, to which Ansar al-Sharia men were believed to have fled. El Farsi found his car, a BMW, and roared off south.</p> <p>Protesters crammed into cars, hooting horns and waving Libyan tricolours as an impromptu convoy surged south. But this time the response was different. The first protesters who marched on the gates were met by machine gun fire, triggering pandemonium. Cars bringing more protesters ran into the traffic jam of abandoned vehicles and civilian cars trying to ferry the wounded to hospital. Pickup trucks with anti-aircraft guns manned by military police sat, their crews unsure if they should return fire.</p> <p>Amid a cacophony of car horns, shouts and the rattle of machine gun fire, red tracer slashed the night sky and protesters dashed for cover. \"The were shooting at the people \u2013 the crowd were all running away,\" said Muhammad el-Gadari, an aviation student who had gone there to search for his younger cousin.</p> <p>I had abandonded my vehicle to try to get to the battle by foot through the chaos of traffic and angry protesters, when a huge, bearded man in a white robe grabbed me, yelling in my ear and violently pushing me backwards. He spoke no English, and I was separated from my translator. When he caught up with us, the man in the robe explained he was not attacking me but defending me: \"You must go away, it is not safe,\" he said. \"We have to protect our foreigners.\"</p> <p>As protester numbers grew and fire was returned, the base garrison fled, abandoning vehicles, guns and huge quantities of ammunition which the crowd looted. City hospitals were meanwhile forced to deal with carnage not seen since last year's war: surgeons were summoned from their beds, blood donors requested. By dawn the toll stood at 11 dead and 19 injured.</p> <p>The wounded included Abu Baker Feraz, who had his leg smashed by a panicking militiaman escaping in a jeep. \"It was an Ansar al-Sharia guy. I know his face. I have seven brothers \u2013 we want to find this man.\" As he was wheeled away to be operated on at Benghazi medical centre, his hand snaked out from the blue shawl that covered him. \"I want to say something,\" he said. \"Ansar al-Sharia, they have somebody from Afghanistan, somebody from Tunisia, somebody from Libya. Islam is not in Ansar al-Sharia.\"</p> <p>It is a refrain you hear across Benghazi: Libya is a conservative Muslim country, and perhaps for this reason jihadists are distrusted for wanting to tell Libyans how to interpret their faith. Cynics say jihadists were wrongfooted by the revolution, won by the ordinary people and Nato, then by July elections that were won by a pro-business coalition, and are staking all on taking power \u2013 and Libya's oil wealth \u2013 by force.</p> <p>The desperate hope here is that the outside world that gave Libya such support in its revolution does not turn away. \"How can you have business if you can't guarantee security?\" said Hana el-Galal, a prominent civil rights activist in the city. \"Everybody now is rallying against organised extremism.\"</p> <p>For now, the city is calm. Whether it stays that way is anyone's guess: the political vacuum at the heart of Libya's government remains, and the Islamists have powerful political allies.</p> <p>Some in Benghazi worry that the streets are now protected by the same police and army commanders who made their careers in Muammar Gaddafi's security forces. Ansar al-Sharia is still around, somewhere, but its leaders are perhaps mindful that, as was shown last year against the Gaddafi regime, Libyan people power should not be underestimated.</p>",
  "<p>The extraordinary 2,000-mile journey made by millions of butterflies each autumn from Canada, through the USA to Mexico is revealed in minute detail for the first time in a multimillion-pound 3D film. The insects' hair, scales and body movements in flight can be seen with a clarity that moved scientists at a preview screening to tears.</p> <p>Filming the migration of the monarch butterfly took five years and was made possible by the development of new technology. The film's British director, Mike Slee, used the pioneering 3D \"snorkel system\" which can film insects in 3D \"like nobody else before\".</p> <p>Micro CT and MRI scans for medical purposes have also been adapted to view inside a chrysalis, showing a caterpillar transform into a butterfly over a period of two weeks.</p> <p>It is thought that<em> Flight of the Butterflies 3D</em> \u2013 which has its world premiere tomorrow \u2013 could do for butterflies what the feature documentary <em>March of the Penguins</em> did for penguins.</p> <p>Monarchs have orange and black wings with distinctive veins and spots, but so detailed is the technology that every butterfly looks individual.</p> <p>The scales on their wings and \"punk\" hairstyles on some heads stand out vividly. So too hundreds of tiny breathing tubes feeding air into the pupa, \"like shredded wheat,\" Slee said. \"Nobody's ever seen in 3D inside a chrysalis as it changes from caterpillar to butterfly.\"</p> <p>He added: \"You watch a caterpillar morph into a butterfly, one of nature's most extraordinary moments. I still can't believe it when I watch it \u2026 It's rather like when they first brought out ultrasound and you could see a baby in the womb.\"</p> <p>Almost all the butterfly footage is shot in slow motion \u2013 120 frames per second rather than 24.</p> <p>Tomorrow's premiere takes place at the Smithsonian, Washington, one of the world's most respected educational institutions, with a UK cinema release to follow. Scientists were overwhelmed by the footage at a preview. One of them, Chip Taylor, said: \"The film is \u2026 truly extraordinary \u2026 I have been amazed by the overwhelming emotional reaction that revealing the scientific secrets of the butterfly has had \u2013 even the eminent board of science advisers had moist eyes when the lights went up.\"</p> <p>Slee made his name as a film-maker of natural history programmes and directed the film <em>Bugs! 3D</em>, about two rainforest insects, narrated by Dame Judi Dench.</p> <p>\"But <em>Bugs</em> was almost wholly shot on film, whereas <em>Butterflies</em> uses digital technology that has changed natural history film-making. Digital allows you to be closer,\" said Slee.</p> <p>The success of <em>Bugs</em> prompted cinemas and several foundations to support this new production, a collaboration between Britain, Canada and Mexico, which follows the quest of one man, the late zoologist Fred Urquhart, to uncover the secret of the butterflies' annual migration. After 40 years, Urquhart discovered their hideaway in remote central Mexico where they spend the winter before returning north.</p> <p>The monarch has multi-purpose antennae and tactile sensory receptors on its head, legs and feet that help it navigate and migrate long distances. Their migration involves flying 25 to 30 miles a day, although some tagged individual monarchs have covered hundreds of miles in a few days. Catching free rides on high altitude winds and storing fat reserves, after arriving, they rest for months in the evergreen trees on the mountaintop.</p> <p>Slee estimates that there are 50m butterflies per hectare, with the sites covering more than six hectares: \"That's a possible 300 million monarchs.\"</p> <p>The film shows millions of them dancing in slow motion. Each wing beat is a whisper, but the film-makers achieve a combined wash of sound.</p> <p>Filming was difficult in 3D and 10,000ft up a mountain, requiring 70ft camera cranes and a 100 crew.</p> <p>Slee said: \"Shooting wildlife in 3D is technically complicated. Things can't come too close to camera, but how do you tell millions of butterflies to stay away? We had to work out tricks. They only fly where there's sunshine. So we created big shades in front of the camera so they wouldn't accidentally come into our danger zone.\"</p> <p>The film could also play a part in the monarch's conservation. Scientists are extremely concerned that monarch populations are declining because the caterpillar's only food source \u2013 milkweed \u2013 is being eradicated.</p> <p>SK Films, the American distributor, is encouraging audiences to grow milkweed and also to create their own butterfly gardens by selling seed-packets in cinemas.</p> <p>The film dispels the myth that butterflies live only for a day. Monarchs create about four generations each year. Those from the first three generations live only a few weeks, but it is the fourth \u2013 known as the \"super generation\" \u2013 that migrates south and survives for between five and six&#xa0;months.</p> <p>\"It's all triggered by daylight and warmth,\" Slee explained. \"They genetically don't mature, and use the spare energy from not having sex to fly 2,000 miles.</p> <p>\"That's their ace. They fly to Mexico, where there's this perfect forest and perfect climate. They go into a dormant state and hang in the trees until the sun shines on them again, and they come back to life. That generation will fly back north to lay eggs \u2026 and the story begins&#xa0;again.\"</p> <p>But even butterflies get lost. Earlier this month, a monarch was spotted in&#xa0;Dorset.</p>",
  "<p>A Turkish court has sentenced three former generals to 20 years in prison on Friday for plotting a coup against the government, and convicted 330 of the 365 suspects in the so-called \"Sledgehammer Coup\" trial.</p> <p>The officers, all of who denied the charges against them, were accused of planning bomb attacks against mosques in Turkey to trigger conflict with neighbouring Greece in order to destabilise the country and justify a military coup against the Islamic AKP government.</p> <p>The Turkish military has traditionally played a dominant role in Turkish politics and staged coups in 1960, 1971, 1980 and 1997.</p> <p>The government's relationship with the military, which regards itself as the guardian of the secular Turkish republic, has been strained since the AKP came to power in 2002.</p> <p>Since then the military has been successfully kept in check by the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p> <p>Former generals \u00c7etin Dogan, \u00d6zden \u00d6rnek and Ibrahim Firtina were initially given life sentences, which were later decreased to 20 years.

According to the transcript of his defence, he said: \"Here we see a process unfolding to make the soldiers of Mustafa Kemal [Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey], who give their lives for their country, pay the price of their commitment to the republic and its principles.\" Erdogan said: \"We still have to wait for the decision of the supreme court of appeals. We have to see the grounds for the verdict first.\"</p> <p>In a statement, lawyer H\u00fcseyin Ers\u00f6z called the trial a \"massacre of law\" and said that the chance of a fair defence had been denied to the defendants.</p>",
  "<p>Everton's supporters may have been getting a little carried away in the late September sunshine when they broke into a rendition of \"We're gonna win the league\", but it was easy to forgive their optimism. Notoriously slow starters, David Moyes's side are enjoying the view from close to the top of the table after a third Premier League victory of the season, courtesy of goals from Victor Anichebe, Kevin Mirallas and the unplayable Marouane Fellaini.</p> <p>Having beaten Swansea City home and away last season and come into this game with a record of not having lost to them in their previous 15 meetings, Everton must wish that they could play against the Welsh club every week.</p> <p>They were superior in every department here and, apart from a brief spell either side of the interval, when Angel Rangel squandered two great chances and Tim Howard produced a couple of fine saves, Everton looked in complete&#xa0;control.</p> <p>The only disappointment from Moyes's point of view was that Everton failed to turn their dominance into more goals on an afternoon when any hopes Swansea had of salvaging something from the game disappeared when Nathan Dyer was dismissed in the 57th minute. The winger, brought on at half-time, picked up his second booking in less than three minutes for a reckless challenge on the excellent Leighton Baines. From there onwards it was about how many Everton wanted to score.</p> <p>\"It's great because you've not heard that very often at Everton,\" said Moyes, when asked about the fans singing about winning the title. \"I think if we had won in midweek [against Newcastle], which we should have done, then we could have quite easily been mixing it with the big boys today. We still are and still hope to be come the end of the season. We have finished the season strongly in a lot of seasons but I think the one year we got off to a good start, we ended up finishing in the Champions League [positions]. We have to try to do that if we can.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, at the start of that season, in 2004-05, Everton also had 10 points from five games. Whether they can sustain it this term remains to be seen but the early signs are promising. The only surprise here was that it took them 22 minutes to score. Everton were so much better than their opponents in the early stages that Michael Laudrup, the Swansea manager, said it would be unfair to complain about Fellaini using his arm in the buildup to Anichebe volleying in the opening goal from close&#xa0;range.</p> <p>Moyes claimed that Swansea should already have been down to 10 men at that point, after Ashley Williams brought down Anichebe following a loose Wayne Routledge pass that was symptomatic of their sloppy start. Anthony Taylor, however, chose to show only a yellow card, with the referee judging that Alan Tate was in a position where he would have been able to get across.</p> <p>There was much to admire about the second Everton goal, which started with Phil Neville and Seamus Coleman playing their way out of trouble. Fellaini picked up possession and threaded a superb pass that invited Steven Pienaar to run in behind Ben Davies before crossing for Mirallas. The Belgian's first effort was superbly deflected on to the crossbar by Michel Vorm \u2013 the first of two occasions he hit the woodwork \u2013 but he headed in the rebound.</p> <p>Rangel spurned two opportunities to haul Swansea back into the game on the stroke of half-time while Michu and Ki Sung-yueng drew fine saves from Howard shortly after the restart. The game, however, was up for Swansea once Dyer was dismissed. Fellaini and Anichebe should have made it 3-0 before the former atoned for his profligacy by heading a Baines free-kick past Vorm in the 83rd minute.</p> <p>When Jonathan De Guzman struck the bar in injury time, it summed up Swansea's miserable day. \"It's a good wake-up call for everybody,\" said&#xa0;Laudrup.</p>",

  "<p>The furor over Todd Akin's \"legitimate rape\" comments had finally settled down when a Republican governor appeared at a Romney rally to praise Republican wives.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's not easy to be a spouse of an elected official. You know, they're at home, doing the laundry and doing so many things while we're up here on the stage getting a little bit of applause, right?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What is the matter with Republicans? With foot-in-mouth disease reaching epidemic levels, it's time to say it: the GOP has a woman problem. It goes much deeper than partisan differences over birth control coverage and abortion. These off-the-cuff comments about selfless spouses and virtuous virgins reveal that too many Republicans do not believe that women are equal to men.</p> <p>The GOP and Mitt Romney, of course, vigorously deny they are waging a \"war on women\". After all, just look at the women paraded across the Republican national convention stage, many of them elected in 2010 as Sarah Palin-branded \"Mama Grizzlies\". The problem, however, is that the GOP's XX politicians don't seem to be looking out for their less powerful sisters. The <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/05/22/488382/gop-women-caucus/?mobile=nc\">24 Republican women in the US House of Representatives cast</a> all of two votes for equal pay, two against domestic violence, and three to let women make their own birth control decisions.</p> <p>The GOP platform includes no exceptions for rape in its anti-abortion plank; Republican Governor Jan Brewer has already signed that policy into law. Only <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/05/22/488382/gop-women-caucus/\">seven Republican congressmen and women</a> voted for the landmark Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, even though women still earn on average 23% less than men. One hundred and forty-three US servicewomen have been killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, yet the Republican party platform opposes women in combat roles. Oh, and did you know that the vaunted Year of the Republican Woman left the GOP with fewer women in Congress than the Democrats had in 1992?</p> <p>Women have gotten the message. Since February, when Congress convened an all-male panel on birth control and Rush Limbaugh called Sandra Fluke \"a slut\", the polling has shown President Obama with a significant and consistent advantage with women voters nationally. The gender gap is particularly wide in swing states. Consider Virginia, which won international notoriety for a mandatory transvaginal ultrasound law, where Obama has opened up <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/to-claim-virginia-obamas-hopes-rest-on-women/2012/09/19/8413388a-026a-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html?wprss=rss_politics\">a 19-point lead</a>. On the hotly-contested abortion issue, Obama holds a 13-point advantage over Romney, <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/19/section-3-views-of-the-candidates/\">according to a recent Pew Center survey</a>.</p> <p>Asked in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll who they thought would be \"better at dealing with issues of concern to women\", more than half said Obama and only a quarter said Romney. Women have also decoded the timeworn cultural assumptions behind the GOP's obsession with our ladyparts. \"What is this, the stone age?\" remarked one independent woman participating in a focus group. Or as a pin spotted at the Democratic National Convention put it: \"Sluts Vote.\"</p> <p>On the issues, the Republican party is out of step with American public opinion \u2013 even with men and many of its own members. Still, America's unexpected preoccupation with women's issues isn't merely about partisan competition or policy differences. It has taken on the character of an existential battle between two incompatible worldviews. </p> <p>The GOP's delirium over birth control and its magical thinking about rape this election season have shocked observers around the world. As remarkable has been the passion and breadth of women's backlash against the GOP's war on women. After all, many of the proposed bills that have in 2012 driven women to the streets and away from Romney-Ryan were enacted without fanfare or much notice in 2011. History's verdict, I suspect, will show that this movement was catalyzed into being less by the assault on reproductive rights and more by women's visceral rejection of the message sent by the Todd Akins, Rush Limbaughs, and Paul Ryans of the GOP: woman, get thee back in your proper place.</p> <p>Half a century on from a time when birth control was illegal and sex discrimination was the norm, many Americans might not have realized how far we've come. Thanks to 2012's preview of the Republican time machine, now we know. The GOP has chosen the wrong side on one of the fundamental global questions of the 21st century: women's equality. Still clinging to their old-timey views about helpful helpmeets and wanton wenches, the Republican party is in imminent danger of being permanently left behind.</p> <p>\u2022 Nancy L Cohen's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Delirium-The-Politics-Sex-America/dp/1619020688/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347573816&amp;sr=1-1\">Delirium: The Politics of Sex in America</a> is now out in paperback.

  "<p>Two young women were killed by a violent man this week. To read that sentence before the tragic deaths of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/uk/2012/sep/18/police-officers-gun-grenade-attack\" title=\"\">PC Fiona Bone and PC Nicola Hughes</a> in Greater Manchester last week, one might have made an assumption about the circumstances. One might have thought they were nurses, attacked by a frenzied patient, or the victims of a fatal domestic dispute. Not many of us, perhaps, would have automatically inferred that these two brave women were police officers who answered a 999 call and suffered&#xa0;fatal injuries in a gun and grenade attack.</p> <p>The sight of two women on the beat is still surprising. The police continues to be a male-dominated profession \u2013 in 2010, 36,121 out of 143,770 officers in England and Wales were women, a quarter of the total. Although great advances have been made \u2013 by comparison, women made up only 7% of the force in 1977 \u2013 the deaths of PC Bone and PC Hughes raised questions about public attitudes towards women in the police.</p> <p>It was telling that, in much of the media coverage, the dead officers were referred to routinely as \"WPC\" in spite of the fact that the prefix \"Woman\" was phased out in 1999. There was the senior policeman who, numb with grief, referred to his colleagues as \"two young girls\", and the passers-by who questioned why a man hadn't been sent out with them \u2013 as if a man could have intuited greater danger on a routine callout or provided a bulletproof shield to his female co-workers.</p> <p>\"It's the kind of sexist attitude that does frustrate me,\" says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/22/cop-robber-unique-friendship\" title=\"\">Jackie Malton, the former detective chief inspector </a>who was the model for DCI Jane Tennison in ITV's <em>Prime Suspect</em>. \"It's the default setting of criticism \u2013 let's look for someone to blame.</p> <p>\"Some of the reaction has been shock that it was two female police. Well, that's what happens in 2012. There have been people asking: 'Why were they sent without a man?' and you're always going to get those comments. But, from what we know, this was a trap. I don't think for a moment [the perpetrator] knew the sex of the officers. It wouldn't have made any difference if a man was there.\"</p> <p>And yet, within the force, there has been a significant culture change over the last few decades. \"It's absolutely less sexist than when I was working in the Flying Squad in the late 80s and early 90s,\" Malton concedes. She recalls that her male colleagues would routinely present her with sex toys \u2013 as a gay woman in a man's world, she says, there was \"always the presumption you're going to need a dildo \u2026 The police had to take a look at themselves. There are now a huge number of women who achieve constable and I do think it's definitely changed for the better. No one [within the police] says anything about Sue Akers being a woman investigating phone hacking and doing a great job.\"</p> <p>As a society we have, on the surface at least, become more used to seeing women carry out traditional male roles. When a woman serving with the 12th Mechanised Brigade in Afghanistan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/20/camp-bastion-birth-soldier-baby\" title=\"\">gave birth to a baby in Camp Bastion</a> last week, the shock was not that she was on the frontline but rather that she hadn't realised she was pregnant. Compare that to the moral outrage in 2007 when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/29/politics.iran2\" title=\"\">Faye Turney was taken hostage</a> by the Iranian authorities and media commentators expressed horror that she had abandoned her young child for a career in the navy.</p> <p>Do we still have a problem with the idea of women and mothers working in areas of conflict \u2013 whether far-flung war zones or domestic gangland feuds? Alex Crawford, the Sky News special correspondent whose book,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/01/sandstorm-gaddafis-hat-libya-review\" title=\"\"> <em>Colonel Gaddafi's Hat</em>,</a> details her experience of the Libyan uprising, believes we do.</p> <p>\"You think things have changed but then you realise they haven't, not really,\" she says. \"You still get this really deep resistance \u2013 not just from the male psyche but from the female psyche too \u2013 about women doing anything other than quite traditional roles. It shows itself in moments of crisis. There's a notion that females who are mothers can't be relevant in their job. I'm always asked: 'Why are you going into war zones? It's irresponsible, it's selfish, you're just doing it for your career.' The same questions have never been asked of a man with kids.</p> <p>\"The American military have only just designed a female body armour. Look at how long it's taken to come up with that! I've just had the health and safety people come out to give me a new flak jacket. I said: 'Don't just give me a new flak jacket. I'd like one that actually accommodates my tits because it's quite uncomfortable.'</p> <p>\"We pride ourselves on being liberal, intelligent, well-educated people and yet suddenly you realise everyone's views are entrenched and we're living in the middle ages.\"</p> <p>Crawford's view is echoed by Natasha Walter, the feminist writer and human rights campaigner. \"We have come a long way,\" she says, \"but there's still an element, almost of amazement, that they [two female police officers] are there at all. That's going to take a long time to go, especially when it comes to the armed services.\"</p> <p>There are currently 1,000 women out of 17,900 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/22/military.gender\" title=\"\">serving on the frontline</a> for the army but women are still excluded from primary combat units whose main duty, according to the Ministry of Defence, is \"to close with and to kill the enemy face to face\". As a result, only 67% of army posts are open to women.</p> <p>In America, a similar policy is being challenged by two female reservists who claim that discrimination based solely on gender has unfairly restricted &#xa0;career advancement. In New Zealand, Canada and Israel, women are allowed to serve in certain combat positions.</p> <p>In the UK there is no sign that the sands are shifting. A 2002 MoD review found that only 1% of trained women soldiers reached the required physical fitness to fight on the frontline. \"Their capacity for aggression was generally lower,\" the document states. \"[Women] required more provocation and were more likely to fear consequences of aggressive behaviour.\"</p> <p>Major Judith Webb, the first woman to command an all-male field force squadron in the army, says we should acknowledge that men and women have different strengths.</p> <p>\"I remember speaking to an officer in the PT [Physical Training] Corps about 10 years ago who was incensed that he'd been sent new standards of fitness and, for the sake of gender equality, they'd been reduced,\" says Webb. \"That is an absolute nonsense. If soldiers need to yomp for 100 miles with 45lbs on their back across the Falklands, they need to be able to do so. It's a very rare woman who can do that.</p> <p>\"I think we're suited to different tasks. It's absolute bullshit that men are more courageous, but I don't think that testosterone, gung-ho attitude does apply to women as much.\"</p> <p>Instead women tend to end up in analytical roles, such as intelligence. \"I worked with intelligence for seven years and I really enjoyed it,\" says Webb, who waited until she had retired from the army to have her first child because she worried she would not be able to combine motherhood and active service. \"I think women are much more patient and good at the detail. Men, as a general rule, are better as infantry soldiers.\"</p> <p>But there are exceptions to general rules. Walter insists that the opportunity should be available for women to serve in combat roles, even if only a few take it up. \"My idea of equality is about women having the freedom to make as many mistakes as they want,\" she explains. \"It's not about what you or I would want them to do.\"</p> <p>How lucky we are, then, that some women, like PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone, are brave enough to take up the challenge.</p>",
  "<p>His disastrous summer has included a botched foreign tour, a mishandled response to the Middle Eastern crisis and the leak last week of a secret video from a private fundraising party where he lambasted many Americans as being \"victims\" of government aid who paid no income tax. The series of gaffes has seen the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, fall behind President Obama in his long run for the White House.</p> <p>Now the challenger is looking to the first presidential debate as a way of hauling his campaign back into contention.</p> <p>The former governor of Massachusetts has already spent long hours preparing for the vital first duel with Obama, which happens on 3 October in Denver, the biggest city in the vital swing state of Colorado.</p> <p>In the minds of many seasoned observers \u2013 including some prominent Republicans who have gone public with their dismay at Romney's performance so far \u2013 something needs to happen soon to put him back in the contest. \"The debate will be Romney's last real chance to bring himself back into the race,\" said Professor Scott McLean, a political scientist at Quinnipiac University.</p> <p>Romney has certainly been taking his debate preparations seriously. He spent three days recently holed up in the Vermont estate of former Massachusetts deputy governor Kerry Healey in practice. During the questions and answer sessions the part of Obama was played by Ohio senator Rob Portman, a former contender to be Romney's running mate.</p> <p>The retreat, isolated among the forests and mountains of the rural north-eastern state, was also attended by most of Romney's top campaign aides. Portman was chosen in part because he also played Obama in 2008 for the campaign of the then Republican candidate, John McCain. The Vermont retreat has been followed up by regular practices on the campaign trail, with Portman rejoining the candidate for further mock debates.</p> <p>The tactic has been a change for Romney. During the long battle to secure the Republican nomination, Romney eschewed mock debates in favour of simply prepping with top aides on different subjects. But clearly the vital importance of the 3 October event has prompted a change in tactics to try to create a \"game-changing\" moment.</p> <p>The Romney campaign has also started to pivot more to the centre in public, perhaps in a bid to counter last week's video release and also a barrage of negative ads from the Obama campaign and its supporters that have successfully portrayed him as a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist. However, given Romney's strong tack to the right during the nomination race, such a manoeuvre would be difficult to pull off.</p> <p>It is sure to be something Obama will bring up in the Denver debate as a sign of flip-flopping on key issues. \"That change of strategy is going to be one of the Romney campaign's biggest problems. Obama will be ready for him,\" said McLean.</p> <p>There are also doubts about Romney's debating skills. Though he participated in no fewer than 19 debates during the nomination process, there were times when he made gaffes or appeared goaded by opponents into losing his cool, such as spontaneously offering to make a $10,000 bet with the Texas governor Rick Perry. \"He seems to be somewhat thin-skinned,\" said Professor David Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron.</p> <p>Such moments are sure to have been studied in great detail by the Obama camp. Exact specifics of the president's debate preparations have been kept largely secret, but it has been reported that Massachusetts senator John Kerry has been playing the role of Romney in mock events held in Washington. Other sessions have included senior campaign advisers like David Plouffe and former aide Anita Dunn. Though Obama has not had to engage in a real debate since the 2008 campaign, he is widely seen as a skilled practitioner of the vital art. \"He is smart, smooth and extremely calm. He seems not to get rattled. He is a very good debater. There is no disputing that,\" said Cohen.</p> <p>But a debate is not simply a straight match-up of skills. A vital part of who wins or loses depends on the expectations of the audience. Many people point to the vice-presidential debate of 2008, which pitted Sarah Palin against Obama's running mate Joe Biden. Palin was seen as such a poor potential debater that when she managed to get through the ordeal without any major gaffe it was seen as a victory by many observers. In this case the Romney team have an advantage in that they are seen as an underdog. Thus if Romney beats those expectations, or a complacent Obama stumbles, it could turn into a genuine opportunity for the Republican to claw back Obama's lead.</p> <p>Experts certainly see that lead as still vulnerable. Hamstrung by a still sickly economic recovery, high rates of joblessness and a disillusioned activist base, Obama's lead in the polls is not a chasm, despite a Romney campaign that has been engaged in nearly non-stop damage control for weeks on end. At the end of last week Clarus Research's national poll average had Obama beating Romney by just three points. The picture was more favourable for Obama in the individual swing states that will decide the election, but no one is predicting any sort of blow-out victory for the Democrats. \"It remains a close race. I look at the numbers and a lot of the data suggests that this race will tighten again,\" said McLean.</p> <p>The Obama team have already been trying to spin that expectations game. Last week they sent out a memo to campaign journalists extolling Romney's virtues at debating and saying that the Republican clearly fancied his chances. \"He's obviously banking on flawless performances in October to achieve the turnaround his campaign has projected,\" wrote Obama campaign manager Jim Messina.</p> <p>That is probably a deliberate exaggeration. But most experts do think that the many instant media pundits who have spent last week writing Romney's political obituary have jumped the gun. As the riots in the Middle East, inspired by an anti-Islamic film shot in California, have shown, unexpected and dramatic events are likely to still play a key role in deciding who sits in the Oval Office next year. As far as the Romney campaign is concerned, they will be going all-out to make sure that the first debate is one of them.</p> <p>Nor will it be their last chance. Two more debates will rapidly follow as the election enters its final weeks, with one touching on foreign policy and another held in a \"town hall\" format where questions will come from undecided voters who are members of the public picked by pollster Gallup. In all three debates the viewing audience is virtually guaranteed to be tens of millions of Americans.</p> <p>\"I am definitely going to get my popcorn out for these debates,\" said Cohen.</p> <p><strong>KEY MOMENTS</strong></p>",
  "<p>When the Uruguayan president Jos\u00e9 Mujica was asked about his <a href=\"http://www.druglawreform.info/en/country-information/uruguay\">proposal</a> to make a historic break with global prohibition and put in place a legal, state-controlled market for cannabis, he replied: \"<a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/06/26/uruguay-wants-to-legalize-marijuana-sales-should-the-rest-of-the-world-follow/\" title=\"\">Someone has to be first</a>.\"</p> <p>In fact, recent years have seen reforms to cannabis policy and law proceeding apace around the world. The <a href=\"http://www.release.org.uk/downloads/publications/release-quiet-revolution-drug-decriminalisation-policies.pdf\">trend for decriminalisation</a> of possession for personal use (with civil or administrative penalties replacing criminal ones) has spread across much of Europe, Latin America, and beyond. Some countries have gone further, finding various ways around the strictures of international prohibition (under the three UN drug conventions) to have de-facto legal supply as well. The famous Netherlands cannabis \"coffee shops\" operate under a legal fudge in which their activities are technically illegal, but in practice are tolerated and licensed. The Spanish decriminalisation policy tolerates the personal possession of two plants and has allowed the creation of more than 300 <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/2011/07/01/cannabis-clubs-in-spain/\" title=\"\">cannabis co-operatives</a>. These pool the allowances of all their members, then farm and supply the resulting grass on a non-profit basis to these members from premises managed by the co-operative.</p> <p>Most surprising have been reforms in the US, the spiritual home of the \"war on drugs\" ethos and still its primary cheerleader internationally, despite more than <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/legalize-marijuana-56-percent-rasmussen-poll_n_1537706.html\">50% of Americans</a> now supporting cannabis legalisation. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_that_have_decriminalized_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States\">Fourteen US states have decriminalised cannabis possession</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States\">17 now allow medical cannabis</a> \u2013 in some cases with the distinction between medical and non-medical use becoming increasingly blurred. Most significant are the <a href=\"http://nationalcannabiscoalition.com/2012/07/comparing-marijuana-legalization-measures-in-oregon-colorado-and-washington-state/\">three state ballot initiatives</a>, in Washington, Oregon and Colorado being voted on in November, which will legalise and regulate cannabis markets for non-medical use.</p> <p>While the US initiatives are groundbreaking and, if <a href=\"http://blog.norml.org/2012/09/12/new-poll-washingtons-marijuana-legalization-initiative-i-502-holds-huge-lead/\">current polling</a> holds up, may well be the first real cracks in the edifice of global prohibition, they are, like most reforms, being led by (excuse the pun) grassroots campaigns. One of the unique aspects of the Uruguayan legalisation proposal is that it is government led. Indeed, the Mujica proposal for a state monopoly on cannabis production and supply has, ironically, run into conflict with another Uruguayan bill promoted by cannabis activists that seeks to decriminalise personal consumption of up to eight plants and establish co-operatives along the lines of the Spanish model.</p> <p>While unlikely to prove popular in the US, the idea of government monopoly is appealing in many ways, certainly for a pioneering initiative such as this. It is vitally important to learn from the mistakes made with alcohol and tobacco regulation. That means avoiding over-commercialisation and, while allowing legal availability to adult consumers, putting in place a regulatory framework to minimise health and social harms, rather than maximise profits. What this means in practice has been explored in some detail in Transform's <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm\">Blueprint for Regulation</a> which outlines potential controls over products (potency, price, information on packaging etc), vendors (licensing, vetting, training requirements), venues for sale and consumption (location, appearance, opening hours), and availability (age access controls, membership clubs). A responsible government is a far better entity to develop such a model than the free market.</p> <p>The regional context of the Mujica proposal is also critical. The debate on drug law reform in Latin America has accelerated, with multiple heads of state now <a href=\"http://transform-drugs.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/12-latin-american-leaders-call-for.html\">openly tabling the possibility of wider reforms including legalisation</a>, and the Organization of American States currently reviewing all the options, as frustrations have grown with the <a href=\"http://evolvecms.webfreelancersuk.co.uk/sites/default/files/Crime-briefing.pdf\">deteriorating security situation and violence</a> related to the drug trade. The perception is that Latin America carries an unacceptably heavy burden for drug consumption in the US and Europe, and that the externally imposed solution, a military and police-led war on drugs, is costly and counterproductive \u2013 as Mexico in particular has found out to its cost in recent years.</p> <p>The Mujica proposal is, perhaps unsurprisingly, couched within a bill of security measures and is being primarily promoted on that basis and, as is often the case with drug reform legislation, it includes provisions for increased penalties for traffickers. It also faces a number of other hurdles; it needs to be reconciled with the decriminalisation bill, and it does not enjoy majority public support (40% are in favour). Then are the objections from the guardians of the prohibitionist status quo, the US and the UN drug agencies.</p> <p>If or when the Uruguayan initiative will be realised remains impossible to say \u2013 they may be first, they may not. But it is now clear that someone will be, and soon. After decades of counterproductive failure, the era of blanket global prohibitions on drugs is finally coming to an end.</p>",

Planners seek to use evidence to try to identify and reflect or give voice to different interests.

Many councils are concerned about the Dawlish public examination outcome, where the community plan failed to pass as a result of its failure to conform with the strategic priorities for the area \u2013 as these had not yet been agreed. Can a neighbourhood plan progress if the core strategy for the area is either absent or incomplete?</p> <p>3.

Offer a named contact who can respond to enquiries and signpost to colleagues where needed</p> <p>3. Make existing information available to communities to help them research their local area. Add value to the work of independent local facilitators, providing resources and support to aid community consultation.

The prevailing view is still that professionals know best and that involving public in what we do is a necessary burden and extra cost, rather than an opportunity to make better policy. Changing this mindset is key, with significant front-end investment in communities at the earliest stage in policy as a first step.</p> <p><strong>Problems with planning so far:</strong> It is only six months or so since the national planning policy framework (NPPF) was published. The one year deadline has put huge pressure on limited planning departments to ensure plans meet NPPF criteria. The short timescale means that the kind of real consultation required has been cut \u2013 and good consultation takes time. The current government statements have created uncertainty over the status of greenbelt land and thrown further confusion into the picture. The lack of resources to deliver government promises and community expectations is not appreciated.</p> <p><strong>Don't treat towns and countryside separately:</strong> The focus seems always to be on towns, rather than the idea that we urgently need rural development too. In both cases, development is more than just building houses. The current polarisation between town and countryside in the NPPF debate is somewhat unhelpful in masking the needs of rural areas.</p> <h2><strong>David Marlow is managing director of </strong><a href=\"http://www.thirdlifeeconomics.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Third Life Economics</strong></a><strong> and a former local authority chief executive</strong></h2> <p><strong>Are we coming at this from the wrong angle?</strong> The issue is for communities to establish what are the priorities they collectively wish to achieve. Thereafter, there are a range of tools and interests that they might deploy to pursue those ends.</p> <p><strong>Neighbourhood plans are highly problematic: </strong>The Localism Act is largely untried and untested, the local plan needs to be largely in place to set the context, and the local authoity needs to be supportive of designating the neighbourhood area and community. And the community needs significant resources to develop the plan and proceed to adoption \u2013 both financial and technical \u2013 and these are often unlikely to be in place. Probably the community is better off, in the first instance, pursuing their ends through other means.</p> <h2><strong>Neil Blackshaw is a consultant at </strong><a href=\"http://www.eastonplanning.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Easton Planning</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Causing conflict: </strong>There is an inherent and rather fundamental conflict between the need to create 'room' for neighbourhood plans and the soundness requirements for local plans. Neighbourhood planning promised a lot including the power to decide where housing takes place, which is going to be an issue for many communities. If a planning authority has to define and allocate all of its housing sites to demonstrate its five year supply then the neighbourhood plan is going to be frustrated. There have already been examples of 'conflict' between the two and it wont take much to alienate local communities.</p> <p><strong>Neighbourhood plans enable 'place-specific' policies:</strong> With the best will in the world, these will not be adequately addressed in the local plan. You could look on them as area action plans under the previous regime but with the added ingredient of intensive involvement. This goes to the nub of it. If the neighbourhood plan is seen as duplicating the local plan then it does all become a massive burden.</p> <p><strong>Healthy communities: </strong>Health provides a far more meaningful aim for local communities than sustainable development.

  "<p>Thursday evening, President Obama told voters during a televised candidates' forum on Univision, the largest Spanish-language TV network, that he regretted not having enacted comprehensive immigration reform during his first term. He described the lack of reform as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/barack-obama-immigration-reform-failure\">his \"biggest failure\" during his first term in office</a>.</p> <p>I share that regret and frustration, but also agree with the president that after election day, we will have a new opportunity to break the Republican gridlock that has thwarted serious immigration reform for decades. But Congressman, you may ask, how could the next four years be any better for enacting immigration reform legislation than the last four years, or eight, or 16? My answer: because of what will happen on election day.</p> <p>President Obama's statement to Univision suggests to me that we will see real leadership from the during his second term \u2013 and I look forward to standing with him to make comprehensive immigration reform a national priority. Election day will be a turning point and significant immigration reform is possible because the dynamics of the issue are shifting.</p> <p>To enact any sensible immigration reform, the Democrats will need to bring 90% of the votes to get a bill passed, but after election day, finding 10% of the votes among Republicans will be a lot easier. If the Republican party is to survive, it must sue for peace on the immigration issue and move beyond gridlock.</p> <p>While jobs, education, and healthcare rank among the top issues for Latino voters, immigration is a threshold issue. If you are opposed to immigration or support strictly punitive immigration measures, you cannot even start a conversation about other issues with most Latino voters. And if your party condones the sharp rhetoric and mean-spirited proposals that some Republicans embrace, it is a tough deficit to overcome. Some leaders inside the Republican party understand this reality.</p> <p>Mitt Romney has fallen with Latino voters and he can't get up. In August, the Romney camp announced a target of attracting 38% of the Latino vote, but his support currently lags in the 20s \u2013 with little chance that it will improve.</p> <p>And in America, we do not elect the president nationally, but state by state, with the electoral college votes of each state you win adding to a national victory. We know how most states will votes, leaving far fewer than a dozen swing states to determine the outcome nationally.</p> <p>Because of Latino voters and their support for Obama, victory looks likely. In Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Florida, Latinos make up significant percentages of the electorate and are breaking strongly for Obama and the Democrats. Even in states like North Carolina and Virginia, where Latinos make up a smaller percentage, the races are so close that how Latinos vote \u2013 both who they vote for and how many turn out \u2013 will probably determine who wins, and therefore who wins nationally.</p> <p>So, I see the day after election day as a day when Democrats look around and say that a huge factor in Romney losing and Obama winning was Latino voters.</p> <p>To be sure, like a lot of constituencies, Latino voters are not as enthusiastic right now about President Obama as they were four years ago. Enforcement of the old, broken system has increased dramatically under President Obama, resulting in record deportations and record expansion of programs to enlist state and local police in enforcing federal civil law, undermining local public safety as a result.</p> <p>The president has accomplished a lot through administrative action to remove threats to our society while allowing assets to our communities to remain in this country. But we can only fully modernize our immigration system through legislation and bring it into the 21st century, including getting more high-skilled immigrants to choose America and reuniting families that sometimes wait more than 20 years for a visa. </p> <p>The Republicans will soon understand how costly their obstruction and wrong-headedness has been, and I think we will be able to return to the table to discuss how we couple legal immigration, legalization for undocumented immigrants, and enforcement in the workplace and at the border into a politically viable and successful immigration reform package. With illegal immigration at an historically low level, we can and must get control of immigration and get millions of undocumented residents into the system and on-the-books.</p> <p>But we will need Republicans who want to help solve the problem to join us.</p>",
