  "<p>Disputes over web domain ownership are expected to hit a record this year as the growing importance of online shopping triggers a wave of legal challenges from owners of famous brands.</p> <p>In one current case, Gucci is insisting that it, rather than an anonymous e-commerce company, should have control of the guccishoponline.org domain name.</p> <p>A key driver of the disputes is the rise of \"cybersquatters\" in China, who register the names of web domains linked to famous brands so they can either sell counterfeit goods or demand money from the brand owner before they relinquish ownership.</p> <p>Famous brands that have taken up cases in the past 12 months include Swarovski, Armani, Burberry, Cartier and Dior. The World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo), which acts as the final adjudicator in arguments over who should be given control of a web domain, decided on nearly 3,000 cases in the 12 months to July 2012, the highest figure since 2007, according to the legal information provider Sweet &amp; Maxwell.</p> <p>Wipo's own figures suggest it is on course to give a record number of judgments for the whole of 2012. In 2011 it adjudicated on 2,764 cases, but by this August it had already decided on 1,931 cases, with one of the busiest periods of the year still ahead.</p> <p>Sweet &amp; Maxwell says that this year Gucci has brought six cases before Wipo to win control of more than 100 domains, such as cheapguccionsale.com and guccishoponline.org. The Austrian luxury brand Swarovski has brought, and won, 32 cases since 2010.</p> <p>Apple, too, has been active, <a href=\"http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/05/17/apple-wins-iphone5-com-dispute\" title=\"\">filing and winning a case in May</a> for control of the iphone5.com domain name, even though it has no product with that name.</p> <p>John Olsen, partner at the law firm Edwards Wildman, said: \"As online retail becomes more profitable, household name brands are taking the defence of their domain names much more seriously. They are doing all that they can to protect their revenue streams. Domain names are the key to the door of online retail.\"</p> <p>The number of disputes could rise even further with the introduction next year of a completely new set of domains. Google has already applied for more than a hundred domain extensions, including \".youtube\".</p>",
  "<p>Samsung has hit back at arch-rival Apple as investors wiped $12bn (\u00a37.6bn) off the South Korean smartphone manufacturer's market value after its loss of a high-profile US court battle over patents.</p> <p>Samsung stock fell 7.5% in the South Korean capital Seoul on Monday as shareholders reacted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/25/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-trial\" title=\"\">the $1bn fine imposed on Friday</a> for copying key elements of the Apple iPhone's behaviour and appearance.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=17705\" title=\"\">angry internal memo</a> Samsung management said Apple had rebuffed attempts to settle out of court. Urging consumers to shun Apple products, they said: \"History has shown there has yet to be a company that has won the hearts and minds of consumers and achieved continuous growth when its primary means to competition has been the outright abuse of patent law, not the pursuit of innovation. We trust that the consumers and the market will side with those who prioritise innovation over litigation, and we will prove this beyond doubt.\"</p> <p>Analysts said the verdict could result in Apple broadening its attack on other handset makers that use Google's Android operating system, potentially hobbling them in the US, the richest segment of the $219bn (\u00a3138.6bn) global smartphone business.</p> <p>Those fears hit shares in Google, which fell 1.4% on Monday in New York. It might also open a door for Nokia, the lossmaking Finnish mobile phone maker, which would be able to offer products without fear of lawsuits. US-listed shares in Nokia gained 9% to in early trading.</p> <p>Although Samsung said it would appeal against the verdict, Judge Lucy Koh could triple the fine because the jury of nine in San Jose, California, determined that the infringement of Apple's patents and designs was \"willful\". Apple will also be able to apply for an injunction against the 24 smartphones and tablets named in the suit at a 20 September hearing.</p> <p>Apple's shares gained almost 2% during the first day of trading in New York after the victory, which chief executive Tim Cook told staff on Friday had been \"about something much more important than patents or money. It's about values \u2026 we [make products] to delight our customers, not for competitors to flagrantly copy\".</p> <p>Apple filed the suit against Samsung in April 2011 and has dozens more pending in other countries against various Android handset makers, accusing them of infringing patents on function so that they behave like the iPhone or iPad.</p> <p>The lawsuits were initiated by the late Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, who said he would \"go thermonuclear\" against Android, which he considered a copy of the iPhone's software. Versions of Android shown before the iPhone's release in 2006 looked more like RIM's BlackBerry; those released after 2010 functioned much more like the iPhone.</p> <p>According to analysts, the verdict \u2013 and Apple's expected request for injunctions against Samsung's infringing phones \u2013 will not hurt the two companies' enormously valuable supplier relationship.</p> <p>Samsung's lawyer told the trial that the company provided about a quarter of the parts in every iPhone, measured by value. Apple is Samsung Electronics' biggest customer, with Samsung providing screens and memory chips for the iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>Since the verdict, there has been an increasing focus on the jury, which shocked observers by reaching a decision in two and a half days, after four weeks of complicated arguments over \"utility patents\" and \"trade dress\".</p> <p>Its foreman, Velvin Hogan, is himself a patent owner and the seven men and two women had legal and engineering experience from companies including Intel and AT&amp;T. Those who have spoken to the press say they worked diligently through the 23 questions on the verdict form, some about alleged infringement by up to 24 devices from three different Samsung subsidiaries.</p> <p>The decision could embolden Apple to broaden its attack on Android. \"We think that the real winner here will be Microsoft and the Windows Phone ecosystem,\" Nomura analysts CW Chung and Manabu Akizuki said in a note. \"As Android and Apple tear each other apart, Microsoft has been waiting in the wings and is in a very good position to move in and entice users to switch from Android to Microsoft, as we have already seen that user loyalty is low.\"</p> <p>Microsoft's Windows Phone software only has about 5% of the global market, but Nokia has now staked its future in smartphones on it and is expected to unveil new devices next month. \"In addition to Apple, we name Microsoft and Nokia as the main beneficiaries from this outcome,\" said Nordea analyst Sami Sarkamies.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's east coast mainline, which runs trains from London to Edinburgh, should remain in public hands, the shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, has said.</p> <p>In a contribution to Ed Miliband's debate on forging a more responsible economy, Eagle said Britain's mainly privatised rail network would benefit from a \"public sector comparator\".</p> <p>Eagle, who is leading the fight for a pause to consider whether it is right to strip Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains of the west coast mainline service, made her intervention in an interview with Progress magazine.</p> <p>She said: \"I think having a public sector comparator is actually tremendously important. I don't really think that east coast as it currently runs has had enough of a chance to be that.\"</p> <p>The east coast mainline was returned to public control in 2009 by Andrew Adonis, the then transport secretary, after he stripped National Express East Coast of the franchise for the line. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/06/national-express-east-coast-nationalised\" title=\"\">company defaulted</a> on its contract after just two years on the grounds that it could not afford the franchise payments.</p> <p>The present government decided in June to launch a consultation to reopen the franchise with the aim of returning it to the private sector by next year. Eagle told Progress: \"There is a very strong argument for not doing that and just letting east coast see what it can do and supporting it in doing that.\"</p> <p>Eagle dismissed the idea that Labour would like to renationalise the entire rail network. \"I'm not interested in setting up some monolithic, centrally-run-from-my-desk nationalised body to run everything. There is a chance for us, as we go into office next time, to let go and to actually empower local communities.\"</p> <p>Eagle believes the strongest argument in favour of keeping the east coast mainline in public hands is that it would allow for what she calls a \"public sector comparator\" to challenge the private sector.</p> <p>Ed Miliband, who travels on the east coast mainline to his Doncaster North constituency, has praised the service and says he is not ideological about ownership. The Labour leader and Eagle have an open mind ahead of the party's policy review that will, as Miliband said, look at \"all of the options&#xa0;\u2026 mutual options, public options, private options\".</p> <p>Eagle also endorsed a recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/14/labour-focus-value-for-money\" title=\"\">Guardian interview by the shadow minister Stella Creasy</a> who said Labour should propose a \"zero-budget\" spending review after the election. Under the Creasy plan, every item of departmental spending would be examined.</p> <p>Eagle, who was a minister in a series of spending departments under the last government, told Progress: \"I think it's something that as a minister I always did. Why wait till day one? I've spent my time in opposition looking line by line at the government's budget. I have to know where money's going to come from, what's available in order to have priorities. Government is about choosing priorities.\"</p> <p>Eagle is one of the few members of the shadow cabinet \u2013 the shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy is another \u2013 who has identified a series of cuts. She has endorsed \u00a36bn of the government's \u00a39bn of cuts in her area.</p>",

  "<p>It is testament to the new-found maturity of Nicolas Colsaerts that his Ryder Cup selection was so widely predicted. He makes no secret of the fact that he had something of a colourful, if not wayward, youth \u2013 nor does he offer any apology for it. To his credit, though, he didn't go down the predictable route of entirely wasting his brilliant talent.</p> <p>Four years ago Colsaerts was ranked outside of the top 1,000 golfers in the world and enjoying a lifestyle in which he played much harder than he worked. On Sunday evening at Gleneagles, the 29-year-old was perfectly entitled to his small libation after receiving the best news of his professional career. \"I just did a bit of drinking at home. It needed to be done,\" he smiled.</p> <p>Colsaerts' receipt of a captain's pick from Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal will make him the first Belgian to appear at a Ryder Cup and will endorse a stunning rise from golfing obscurity. In a country where golf has a battle to generate any form of coverage, Colsaerts is suddenly a prominent sporting figure.</p> <p>\"I knew I had it in me, but I knew I was going to be a bit of a clown before I got there,\" said Colsaerts of his Ryder Cup confirmation. \"I had my mid-life crisis at 25, which was a good thing. I got it out of the way. People took me aside to have a word, to tell me to knuckle down a million times, but that decision has to come from you. Everyone is busy doing their own things \u2013 no one has time to babysit out here.\"</p> <p>Which begs the question of what changed. \"At one stage [in 2008] I was offered to go to Australia and I felt it was the perfect opportunity for me to grab and start a new life,\" Colsaerts recalled. \"That's exactly what I did. I went to an academy over in Brookwater, Brisbane and got to meet some wonderful guys. I spent about 10 months over a period of three winters in Australia, so it was a great hideaway place for me for a little bit.</p> <p>\"To be honest I didn't make much money until last year. It's funny how everybody has this idea of me being really wealthy but I'm only starting to make some cash in the last year. Ten years on tour without making any is pretty difficult.\"</p> <p>With any fiscal issues to the side for now, the only monitoring that Colsaerts will require in Chicago in September is by virtue of the fact he is the only rookie Ryder Cup performer in Olaz\u00e1bal's team. That situation is offset by the big-hitting Colsaerts' fondness for matchplay events; he won the Volvo World Match Play Championship earlier this year. \"The reason why it worked at the matchplay was that I'm always hitting second in the fairway and I kept putting it inside the other guy,\" added Colsaerts. \"I think that's why I did so well.</p> <p>\"I give myself a lot of chances and when you are put under the gun in a matchplay format and forced to do stuff, sometimes the target gets smaller. Your focus becomes more intense and that's why I like matchplay.\"</p> <p>Olaz\u00e1bal insists it would be wrong to identify Colsaerts simply on account of his distance from the tee. \"Nicolas has had a wonderful year,\" said the European captain. \"All the players know him. He can hit the ball really long but don't be mistaken, he does a lot of other things. He can shape the ball, he has a lot of shots.</p> <p>\"I have played with him a few times in the last year and seen him hit half shots to put the ball on the fairway. He can fade it, draw it, and his short game is pretty solid, so he has a lot of tools in there.\"</p> <p>Colsaerts and Ian Poulter emerged as Olaz\u00e1bal's obvious wildcard choices with the former's credentials enhanced by his willingness to play a string of tournaments on either side of the Atlantic in a bid to gain an automatic place.</p> <p>\"As much as a I thought I was going to be chosen, you can't help thinking that maybe the captain wants other things, maybe he's looking at someone else,\" said Colsaerts. \"I felt pretty confident. I wouldn't have understood why if I hadn't been chosen.\"</p> <p>Colsaerts can now admit that his Ryder Cup ambitions began more than a decade ago, when first competing in tournaments at Gleneagles. The meeting of Europe and the United States will take place at that venue in two years' time.</p> <p>\"The first year I came here was 2001, and it was probably around 2005 that I started to think I would have a reasonable chance to be part of this in 2014. But some presents come early. I thought that you have to show that you want this. It's not for the faint-hearted, you have to show your ambitions, that you are part of this and that you can bring something to it. I think my character will hopefully be suited to a Ryder Cup. I've felt nervous about getting into the team but I don't feel nervous yet about playing on the team.\"</p> <p>That trepidation may now increase. But if it does, Colsaerts need only glance back at where he has come from to pacify such anxieties.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Richard Branson's hopes of clinging on to the west coast rail franchise are fading as the government prepares to formally strip Virgin Trains of the London-Glasgow route.</p> <p>The Department for Transport has rejected Branson's offer to run the franchise for free if it delays its decision to award the 14-year contract to FirstGroup. It is expected to sign the new \u00a35.5bn deal as soon as Wednesday morning, although Virgin was still considering last-ditch legal action.</p> <p>FirstGroup's chief executive, Tim O'Toole, warned that any delay in awarding the contract would wreak havoc as the industry prepares to bid for a slew of high-profile routes, including the Great Western and east coast franchises.</p> <p>\"This is a huge piece of work that is in front of the industry and we have to get on with it,\" O'Toole said. Delaying the west coast decision would \"invite this kind of behaviour in other deals\".</p> <p>He defended FirstGroup's record as the operator of multiple franchises, including Scotrail and First Capital Connect. Responding to repeated warnings from Branson that FirstGroup had overbid, O'Toole said: \"This company is going up against an organisation whose core competency is publicity and PR. And they would be a formidable opponent if that was the only criteria.\"</p> <p>Branson took to the radio and TV studios on Monday to urge David Cameron to intervene in the row and \"get some sense\" into the DfT. He said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The person that can really intervene to try to get some sense into the Department for Transport is the prime minister, and the prime minister is currently on holiday, the chancellor is on holiday and we would like things delayed by a month or so.</p> <p>\"If, as a result of that, it means that the handover is delayed, we would obviously be very happy to run it on a not-for-profit basis.\" The DfT said it had no reason not to sign the agreement.</p> <p>The Labour party called for the east coast mainline, which runs trains from London to Edinburgh, to remain in public hands. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said Britain's mainly privatised rail network would benefit from a \"public sector comparator\".</p> <p>Eagle told Progress magazine: \"I think having a public sector comparator is actually tremendously important. I don't really think that east coast as it currently runs has had enough of a chance to be that.\"</p> <p>The east coast mainline was returned to public control in 2009 by Lord Adonis, then transport secretary, after he stripped National Express East Coast of the franchise.

  "<p>A scorching morning in the San Fernando valley and I am driving up and down Balboa Boulevard, parks and fields either side of the motorway, lost. The talking GPS on my dashboard has lapsed into silence, defeated by an arcane destination with no zip code. I spy a park attendant emptying a bin and pull over to ask directions. He eyes me, baffled. I wonder if he is deaf and repeat the question. He still looks confused. \"Did you say river?\" Yes, I reply. Where is the river? He shakes his head. \"What&#xa0;river?\"</p> <p>I find an elderly woman with a straw hat walking her terrier and ask the same question. She looks puzzled. \"What river, honey?\" The river I am supposed to kayak, I reply. She looks at me compassionately, as if I have sunstroke. \"I don't think you're in the right&#xa0;place.\"</p> <p>But I am. Swishing below, all but invisible from the park and motorway above, is the Los Angeles river. A river with water, fish, tadpoles, birds, reeds, banks, a river that flows for 52 miles skirting Burbank, north Hollywood, Silver Lake, downtown and Compton and empties into the Pacific Ocean at Long Beach. A regular river, except that to most Angelenos it's a secret. I&#xa0;ask three other people and receive the same blank looks until finally a park ranger confirms that, yes, there is a river at the bottom of a ravine all of 150ft away.</p> <p>There, amid the reeds, bob a dozen little green and red kayaks, and people wearing helmets and lifejackets are clambering inside them. It is the inaugural season of <a href=\"http://lariverexpeditions.com/\" title=\"\">LA River Expeditions</a>, a pioneering effort to reclaim a waterway that vanished from the city's consciousness almost a century ago. \"Welcome,\" says George Wolfe, the group's founder. \"I&#xa0;hope you're ready for adventure.\" We push off into the current.</p> <p>Until recently this excursion would have been considered not just mad but illegal. City authorities encased the river bed in concrete in the 1930s, turning it into a flood-control channel that was a byword for contamination and forbidden to boaters. For decades it languished all but forgotten, save for Hollywood using its storm drains in films such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsYC-hVEpQM\" title=\"\">Grease</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnM7mFX8D_4\" title=\"\">Terminator 2</a>. Now, however, it has formally opened to boating tours, specifically kayaks and canoes. Activists hope it is the first step towards transformation. \"It's a milestone, and hopefully there are more to come,\" says Charles Eddy, a board member of Friends of the LA&#xa0;River, and part of this expedition, as he navigates his kayak through brambles. \"If you think of the river as a blank palette, people will create all sorts of wonderful things.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395850980\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346077212783/Kayakers-in-Los-Angeles-010.jpg\" alt=\"Kayakers in Los Angeles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kayakers paddle under the Woodley Avenue bridge in Los Angeles.

The river, fed by streams from the Simi hills in Canoga park, originally provided food, water and transport for Gabrielino Indians and Spanish settlers.

The diverted Owens river is no longer enough \u2013 LA&#xa0;county is home to about 10 million people, not to mention vast farms further south clamouring for irrigation. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-0808-delta-conservation-plan-20120808,0,4862053.story\" title=\"\">Governor Jerry Brown is championing a proposed $14bn (\u00a39bn) tunnel system to divert water from northern California to southern California's parched cities and farms.</a> Two tubes, each 33ft wide, would direct part of the Sacramento river \u2013 up to 9,000 cubic feet a second \u2013 to existing pumps and aqueducts, supposedly ending <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-cap-water-20120730,0,7084638.column\" title=\"\">the water conflicts that Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and a string of other governors failed to resolve</a>.</p> <p>\"This thing is never going to be free of controversy and conflict,\" <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-25/brown-says-14-billion-plan-will-boost-california-water\" title=\"\">Brown told a press conference last month</a>. \"But we know a lot more today than we did then.

Some analysts think the water wars will drag on, with southern California seeking ever more desperate remedies for its water shortages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395850981\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346083196073/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day-007.jpg\" alt=\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LA as a \"soulless, dystopian metropolis\": Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

But to a coalition of artists, historians, environmentalists and outdoors enthusiasts its fate symbolises an attempt to make LA, branded by critics a soulless, dystopian metropolis, a kinder, gentler, more integrated city.</p> <p>\"We have to start thinking in new ways, and using words differently. If you call it a sewer ditch you treat it like a sewer ditch. Call it a river and you treat it like a river,\" says Wolfe, the expedition leader, as our group paddles upstream through a gorge. An advertising copywriter with a passion for canoeing, Wolfe and some companions made the first journey down the entire river over three days in 2008. It was technically illegal \u2013 the city did not want anyone in its drainage ditch \u2013 but they rebuffed police challenges with a (legitimate) filming permit, a magical pass when dealing with the LAPD, and made it to Long Beach.</p> <p>The voyage obliged authorities to admit that the waterway was navigable, something previously denied, and created a legal wedge to demand public access under public trust doctrine, a concept dating from Roman law. Eddy says 80% of the water was treated sewage, most of the rest groundwater with modest contamination. \"My dog has been drinking it for seven years and he hasn't got three tails.\"</p> <p>Inch by inch, authorities yielded, allowing Wolfe and his friends to take 300 people down the river in a pilot project last year. After nobody drowned or contracted a hideous disease, LA River Expeditions was allowed to start running regular, scheduled trips this summer for around 2,000 people. Tickets \u2013 $55 (\u00a335) each \u2013 were snapped up within minutes of going on sale. \"So here we are,\" says Wolfe, as the group of mostly novice kayakers bump and splash in his wake along a narrow stretch of surging water. The mood is giddy. Like the park attendant and dog-walker, until recently some of us did not even know there was a river, or where it was, or that it was usable. \"I've lived near this river almost all my life and I've never been on it. I jumped at this chance,\" says Gloria Barke, 77, a retired events organiser, as her partner Robert Finkle, 81, a copyright lawyer, paddles from the back.</p> <p>The LA river will never compete with the Danube or Seine or Thames as an attraction for stressed city-dwellers. Nor will it inspire many poems or novels. It is too meagre, too hidden, to ever be fully part of the city. But advocates are on to something when they say it can transform perceptions of LA.</p> <p>After passing a concrete bridge with graffiti-daubed arches and a shopping trolley half-buried in mud, we enter a wilderness that seems a world removed from the freeways and urban sprawl above. \"We call this the Grand Canyon,\" says Wolfe, showing his flair for advertising, as we paddle through a mini-gorge 15ft tall. Nature slowly asserts itself. To our left are wild fig trees, descendants of those planted by the Indians, to our right potentially deadly ricin-producing plants. Further on, hallucinogenic jimson weed. \"Around the next bend is the Apocalypse Now bit,\" says Wolfe. We encounter \"fish sticks\": improvised traps made by unknown hands to trap carp, tilapia and other species. A discourse on how to make the traps is drowned out by a passenger jet roaring low overhead, briefly breaking the spell.</p> <p>The sense that this is something special returns as we moor our boats and slosh ashore, inspecting plants, a turtle shell, a cascade, before resuming the journey. It is difficult to believe that the 405 freeway, the gridlocked bane of LA motorists, is just a mile away. Three hours later we return to where we started, a swampy bank, and moor the kayaks amid some ducks. The tour is over. We saw nothing that would excite David Attenborough. But we glimpsed another LA, one not consumed by automobiles, or turned into a strip mall, where nature and human optimism thrive in a watery realm, an ever so slightly mystic river.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012. The original referred to hallucinogenic gypsum weed. That should have been jimson weed, or Datura, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Raymond Kelly, the New York police commissioner, has defended two of his officers whose decision to fatally shoot an armed man outside the Empire State Building on Friday led to nine bystanders being injured.</p> <p>Kelly on Monday described the shooting as appropriate in the circumstances. The officers had been told that Jeffrey Johnson had killed a co-worker around the corner and was pointing his gun at the pair during rush hour on West 33rd St in Manhattan.</p> <p>The NYPD's handling of the shooting was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/empire-state-building-shooting-nypd-response\">questioned by one of those injured</a>. A grand jury, convened on Monday, will decide whether the police response was reasonable.</p> <p>Robert Asika, 23, told the Guardian on Monday that he stood by his comments on Friday, when he accused police of \"shooting randomly\". Asika, who was on his way to hospital on Monday because of bleeding from the wound to his elbow, said he saw at least two others being hit by police bullets.</p> <p>He told the Guardian on Friday: \"If you're gonna aim, try and aim perfectly. If you wanna aim at the target, you got to know what you're doing, because it's the street.\"</p> <p>NYPD officers are authorised to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger.</p> <p>Sanford Rubenstein, a personal injury lawyer who has represented several clients suing the NYPD, including the family of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bell_shooting_incident\">Sean Bell, who was killed by police after leaving his bachelor party in 2006</a>, said: \"This is not a decision to be made by the commissioner or the mayor. Ultimately, it is a decision for a jury.</p> <p>\"Clearly the man did have a gun and he had just murdered someone. The question is reasonableness. People who are innocent bystanders should not be put at risk of death possibly, or being wounded, if it's not 'reasonable' for the officers to take the action that they took. It is a serious issue. By firing 16 shots, six by one and I understand nine by the other, whether the police endangered innocent people.\"<br> The incident began just after 9am on Friday when Johnson, described as a \"disgruntled former employee\", walked up to Steve Ercolino, 41, his former manager at Hazan Imports, a business that operates from premises near the Empire State Building. Johnson shot him three times before calmly walking away.</p> <p>Reports suggest Johnson, 58, did not fire his gun when he was confronted by officers. The officers, who were on duty outside the Empire State Building, were alerted by a construction worker.</p> <p>Nine bystanders suffered non-life threatening injuries caused by police bullets. The patrolmen were placed on desk duty while prosecutors review their response.</p>",
  "<p>The first account of what happened in a remote part of southern Helmand under Taliban control ticked all boxes: 15 men and two women had been found beheaded as punishment for attending a mixed-sex party, with music and dancing. Subsequent accounts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/taliban-execute-civilians-at-party\" title=\"\">muddied the water</a>: the heads of the victims were not cut off, the dead may have been caught up in a fight between two Taliban commanders over the women, and may have included some of the Taliban themselves. The executions were only the start of a bloody 24 hours. Ten Afghan soldiers died in a Taliban assault on a checkpoint and two US soldiers were killed by their Afghan allies after a dispute broke out during a joint patrol.</p> <p>Reality keeps on intruding into the official narrative of the war, which is being allegedly wound down. The theory being that as Afghan army and police \"stand up\" to the fight, their western allies and mentors can draw down and go home. The Taliban routinely claim every Isaf death, but it was the incident in which they were not involved which has the potential to destroy the heart of Isaf's withdrawal; 42 coalition soldiers have been shot this year by the men they are supposed to be training, 12 this month alone. Each time one of these \"green on blue\" attacks occurs, a phrase which makes the deaths sound like the instructions in a knitting pattern, coalition spokesmen play down their significance. They have, we are continually told, no wider significance. There is no common thread, little evidence of infiltration and the majority of such attacks are the result of personal grudges.</p> <p>A team of US military psychologists investigated last year what these grudges were. Their findings so concerned them that they called their report <a href=\"www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/.../docs/Document%2011.pdf\" title=\"\">A Crisis of Trust and Cultural Incompatibility</a>. Extensive research among the Afghan National Army \u2013 68 focus groups \u2013 and US military personnel alike concluded: \"One group sees the other as a bunch of violent, reckless, intrusive, arrogant, self-serving profane, infidel bullies hiding behind high technology; and the other group [the US soldiers] generally views the former as a bunch of cowardly, incompetent, obtuse, thieving, complacent, lazy, pot-smoking, treacherous, and murderous radicals. Such is the state of progress in the current partnering programme.\" Over a decade of fighting shoulder-to-shoulder had created mutual loathing that was impossible to camouflage. The mutual grudge match ranged from big issues \u2013 night raids, failure to treat Afghan military casualties with the same urgency as their own \u2013 to trivial ones - urinating in public, personal hygiene, thievery. \"They simply do not trust us, and after all this time, it is highly unlikely that they ever will,\" the report said.</p> <p>This is, perhaps, worse than finding the ANA is riddled with Taliban sleeper cells. Infiltration can be stopped by counter-intelligence. But what, after this length of time, reduces sheer bad faith? Mutual loathing (if this is the opinion of trained soldiers, what must it be like among the population?) strikes at the heart of the strategy of the draw down, which relies on the ability of Isaf units to forge working relationships with their Afghan counterparts.</p> <p>And then, of course, there is the war itself, which is also proving stubbornly resistant to a redemptive ending. Barack Obama's surge of 30,000 troops was concentrated on Helmand and Kandahar provinces, two of the most volatile areas in Southern Afghanistan. The surge is nearly over, but those two provinces still rank as the most violent in the country. Ten districts out of Afghanistan's 405, account for half of all insurgent violence, and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/afghanistan-violence-helmand/\" title=\"\">six of those are in Helmand province</a>. So what exactly did the surge achieve and how much of it will be sustainable? Afghan ambivalence to the \"help\" they have had from abroad was encapsulated recently by Independence Day, 93 years since Amir Amanullah Khan proclaimed independence from the British empire. Opinion was divided: was it a real day, or a meaningless exercise in flag-waving, with foreign troops still deployed in their homeland?</p>",

  "<p><strong>Shopping with friends: good or bad&#xa0;idea?</strong></p> <p><em>Martha, by email</em></p> <p>Well, Martha, this is dependent on two factors: you and your friends. Seeing as the friends you choose are dependent on you, too, it is ultimately entirely dependent on you.</p> <p>As for the friends, obviously the ideal friend you want for shopping excursions is a jolly, amenable, selfless and brutally honest one, which is not necessarily an easy combination to come by. Jolliness because, well, who wants to hang out all afternoon with someone who is less than jolly?</p> <p>Amenable because you don't want someone who complains when you suggest going into a third Zara just to check if the stock is any better in this one than the previous two.</p> <p>Selfless because, secretly, you want this shopping trip to be mainly about you and while you will graciously allow your friend to try on a couple of garments, if anyone is going to be spending the majority of the afternoon sitting outside changing rooms waiting for the other person, it will be her.</p> <p>And finally, and most importantly, brutal honesty. You need someone who will tell you that no, that skirt really doesn't work; no, you really don't need another pair of gold flats; no, you will never ever wear that bodice-style dress; yes, \u00a3750 is too much to spend on a handbag that you will probably never carry on a night out for fear of wrecking it. But yes, that long dress looks amazing on you; yes, that silver wallet will be surprisingly useful; yes, one-piece bathing suits are brilliant and you should definitely get one.</p> <p>It's not easy to find such a friend, though. I have been fortunate enough in my life to find two such ones (Carol and Imogen, take a bow), but in the main, most friends, most human beings, are either too discouraging or&#xa0;too encouraging.</p> <p>The problem with overly discouraging friends (\"No, don't get that \u2013 I'm sure you can find it cheaper if you look for hours and hours on the internet\") is that you end up never going shopping with them again, so they become irrelevant.</p> <p>Overly encouraging friends \u2013 or, as I call them, shopping enablers \u2013 think they're being nice and conducive to fun times by telling you to buy everything you try on, but they are not. They mean well, these folk (\"Buy it! It'll make you feel better\") but they are not true shopping friends. Enablers are always fun in the moment but the regret that sets in later is never worth&#xa0;it.</p> <p>And this is where we must turn to you, Martha. Without wanting to indulge in any kind of victim blaming, ask yourself if there's a reason your friends provide the kind of advice they do. If they are mainly enablers, is there something about your behaviour that discourages dissent from your friends? Everyone has friends with whom they feel they can't be entirely honest for fear of upsetting them. Don't be that kind of friend. Honesty is as important a quality in friendship as constant availability by telephone.</p> <p>Finally, look to your judgment about who you choose to bring on a shopping expedition. Come on, Martha, you know your friends. If you bring only enablers with you there is clearly a part of you that wants to buy everything in the whole damn shop and to hell with it. And that's just fine \u2013 once. Everyone has at least one time of need in their life when they have, to paraphrase Peaches, to shop the pain away. If this is not one of those times, you need to be as honest with yourself as your friends should be and bring non-enabling friends on the shopping trip. Think of it as being the human equivalent of throwing out the HobNobs when you're on a diet: just remove the temptation.</p> <p>In the spirit of brutal honesty, I'll be honest with you, Martha. As fun as hanging out with friends is, I pretty much never go shopping with friends. It is just too distracting and, tough as I am on you about putting strictures in place so as not to be misled into making a poor shopping decision, I am terrible at this myself, even, sometimes, with the guidance of saintly Carol and Imogen. So I've had to do the strictest thing of all with myself and now I only go shopping alone. Because as valued as the advice of friends always (well, sometimes) is, if you can't trust yourself, you can't really trust anyone. Ultimately, you're&#xa0;wearing these purchases, not your friends.</p> <p>Then I meet my friends afterwards for a cup of tea and we can focus on the important things in life, like laughing at Heat magazine and recent office crushes. Because that, really, is what friends are for.</p> <p><em>Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask&#xa0;Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90&#xa0;York &#xa0;Way, London N1 9GU.

  "<h2>George Osborne, chancellor (48%)</h2> <p><strong>Highs</strong>: pledge in autumn 2007 to raise the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m, wrong-footing Gordon Brown who had hoped to call an early election. Grand gestures made in tradition of his political hero, Lyndon Baines Johnson. Doesn't like to be reminded that LBJ's grandest gesture \u2013 the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2013 reportedly prompted him to declare that he had \"lost the south for a generation\".</p> <p><strong>Lows</strong>: admitting in his autumn statement last year that he would fail to meet his target of eliminating the structural budget deficit by the next election in 2015 and presiding over a double dip recession. Misjudging this year's budget when a series of relatively small measures to pay for a cut in the 50p top rate of tax, such as the pasty taxes, proved deeply unpopular.</p> <h2>Andrew Lansley, health secretary (37%)</h2> <p><strong>Highs</strong>: playing an important role during a lengthy stint as shadow health secretary, between 2003-2010, in helping to detoxify the Tory brand on the NHS. High point came in 2008 when David Cameron was praised by junior doctors at a rally. Shortly afterwards at the Tory spring conference in Nottingham Cameron named Lansley as a future member of a Tory cabinet.</p> <p><strong>Lows</strong>: years of work reassuring voters on Tory intentions on the NHS unravelled when Lansley introduced the health and social care bill after the 2010 election which set up new GP-led commissioning groups and increased the role of private sector in providing health services. Lansley said his plans were signalled before the election.</p> <h2>Michael Gove, education secretary (36%)</h2> <p><strong>Highs</strong>: the pace of his reforms have been eyed jealously across the cabinet. Introducing legislation at breakneck speed to allow for the creation of a new generation of free schools which will not be answerable to local education authority control. Being feted as one of the few Tories with the flair to be seen as a future prime minister.</p> <p><strong>Lows</strong>: embarking on a series of U-turns in his first year in office on school sports funding and providing free books for children. Being forced to revise official figures after 25 errors were identified in one day when he announced a scaling back of the \u00a355bn Building Schools for the Future programme. Scaling back plans to replace GCSEs with two-tier exam system under pressure from Lib Dems.</p> <h2>Kenneth Clarke, justice secretary (28%)</h2> <p><strong>Highs</strong>: leading Britain out of recession after his appointment as chancellor in 1993, a year after the disaster of Black Wednesday. Being summoned back to the Tory frontbench in 2009, at the suggestion of George Osborne, after 12 years on the backbenches.</p> <p><strong>Lows</strong>: three failed attempts to win the leadership of the Conservative party in 1997, 2001 and 2005. Lowest of the low was his \"dream ticket\" with his arch Eurosceptic opponent, John Redwood, in 1997. Currently fighting pressure to demote him from justice secretary to leader of the House of Commons after a series of run-ins with No 10 over his liberal approach to criminal justice policy.</p> <h2>Jeremy Hunt, culture secretary (24%)</h2> <p><strong>Highs</strong>: appointment to the cabinet \u2013 one of only two Tories along with Gove to make it in 2010 just five years after election to parliament. Involvement in the successful Olympic Games.</p> <p><strong>Lows</strong>: emails released by the Leveson enquiry showed that Hunt texted \"great and congrats\" to James Murdoch in December 2010 after the European Commission cleared the News Corp bid for BSkyB. Later that day Hunt was given responsibility for the bid. At the Leveson enquiry he also revealed his full name \u2013 Jeremy Richard Streynsham Hunt.</p> <h2>William Hague, foreign secretary (21%)</h2> <p><strong>Highs</strong>: becoming one of the most widely travelled foreign secretaries in recent years as he visits countries, such as Australia, that have been neglected by Britain. Leading one of the happiest and most cohesive ministerial teams in Whitehall. Being called on regularly by the prime minister for words of advice as ex leader.</p> <p><strong>Lows</strong>: losing the 2001 general election after basing his campaign on an issue of little interest to voters \u2013 the EU \u2013 while largely ignoring issues they cared about such as schools and hospitals. Releasing a deeply personal statement in 2010 about the difficulties he and his wife Ffion experienced in starting a family to kill off \"untrue and deeply distressing\" rumours of an affair with a 25-year-old male former special adviser.</p> <h2>Possible cabinet departures</h2> <p>\u2022 Cheryl Gillan, Welsh secretary, 60, is a fierce opponent of the high speed rail line from London to Birmingham that will tear through her Chesham and Amersham constituency.</p> <p>\u2022 Sir George Young, attends cabinet as leader of the House of Commons, 71, has been widely praised for his deft handling of MPs across the chamber. But David Cameron needs to make space for the next generation.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrick McLoughlin, chief whip, 54, is held in high personal regard by the prime minister. But McLoughlin may decide to return to the backbenches after 17 years in the Tory whips office.</p>",
  "<p>The shadow chancellor Ed Balls is marginally out-polling Ed Miliband, according to the Guardian/ICM poll released amid reports of fresh tensions between the two most senior figures in the Labour party.</p> <p>As well placed Labour sources say the problems of the Tony Blair/Gordon Brown years are being replayed, the poll gives the shadow chancellor a net job satisfaction rate of minus eight points. This compares with minus 13 points for the Labour leader.</p> <p>Miliband is unlikely to lose much sleep over the figures. He out-polls Balls on who is doing a good job \u2013 by 33% to 31%. But asked the opposite question, 46% of those polled said they believe he is doing a bad job compared with 39% who believe Balls is doing a bad job.</p> <p>Balls beats Miliband in part because a relatively high proportion (30%) said they did not know when asked whether the shadow chancellor was doing a good job. This compares with 21% for Miliband who has a much higher profile than Balls.</p> <p>The poll has some good news for Miliband whose net satisfaction rating of minus 13 points is slightly down on May. This is an improvement on December last year when he recorded minus 17 points.</p> <p>Miliband is outperforming Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who has a net satisfaction rate of minus 26 points, as well as chancellor George Osborne, who is on minus 32 points, and the coalition overall (minus 24 points). But David Cameron is still beating Miliband by a hair's breadth. The prime minister's net satisfaction is at minus 12 points.</p> <p>There are reports that the Labour leader, who promoted Balls to the post of shadow chancellor against his better instincts after the surprise resignation of Alan Johnson, is finding him hard work and secretive.</p> <p>One Labour figure said: \"The whole thing has become a complete nightmare. It is fair enough that spending commitments have to be cleared with the Balls team. But it has reached the point where shadow cabinet ministers cannot say anything on any policy that has spending implications.\"</p> <p>Balls is criticised for centralising control and for demanding that shadow ministers stick to his five pledges for growth which include reversing the VAT rise for a limited period and introducing a one-year national insurance break to help small firms.</p> <p>The Labour source said: \"Ed Balls just wants complete centralisation. His view is he has his five pledges on the economy and all shadow cabinet members should just repeat them. The Ed Balls team continually block policy proposals from other members of the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>\"Ed Miliband's team will say they are keen to offer support and then fail to weigh in on other people's behalf. Maybe we will win the next election by just repeating the five pledges but that is unlikely.\"</p> <p>Miliband knew that he was taking a gamble when he appointed Balls as shadow chancellor in January 2011 after Johnson resigned for personal reasons. Balls always regarded Miliband as his junior when they worked for Gordon Brown. Aides warned at the time that Miliband would have less room for manoeuvre if he appointed Balls to the pivotal position occupied by Brown in the runup to the 1997 general election.</p> <p>The Labour leader said there would be no repeat of the Blair-Brown tensions. But critics in the party say Miliband often gives the impression that he is in awe of Balls. Frontbenchers say that, in every meeting of the shadow cabinet, Miliband invites the relevant shadow minister to speak before calling on Balls.</p>",
  "<p>As he turns his mind from his rain-soaked holiday in Cornwall to his imminent ministerial reshuffle, David Cameron is presented with evidence to support what until now has been confined to mutterings among senior colleagues.</p> <p>Two of the prime minister's closest allies, George Osborne and William Hague, stand at opposite ends of the cabinet popularity contest, according to this month's Guardian/ICM poll. Nearly half (48%) of voters would like to see the chancellor removed in next month's reshuffle while only 21% are calling for the head of the foreign secretary.</p> <p>The findings are likely to be seized on by Conservative MPs who believe the government can only revive its chances if it sends out an unmistakable signal that it is rejuvenating its economic policy without embarking on a U-turn over the deficit reduction plan. In the tearooms at Westminster, MPs are saying this can only be done by persuading Osborne and Hague to swap roles.</p> <p>One senior figure who floated this option thought it was highly unlikely to actually happen: \"Will the prime minister sacrifice his chancellor? I doubt it. And I can't see William moving.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, a keen student of the Blair years, is instinctively wary of reshuffles. He believes Blair was wrong to think he could refresh his government by reshuffling the pack once a year.</p> <p>Cameron's view is that Blair ended up with a series of ministers who were in their posts for such a short period they barely had time to understand their ministerial briefs.</p> <p>He has therefore waited two years to carry out his first substantial reshuffle, keeping to his plan when he became prime minister. But his thesis that reshuffles rarely transform the fortunes of a government is being tested, because he is moving ministers around at the very moment when the government badly needs a fresh makeover as it struggles with the issue that will determine its success \u2013 the economy.</p> <p>Many Tory MPs believe the government is crying out for one bold step: moving Osborne. According to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/27/coalition-unlikely-hit-economic-goals\" title=\"\">pamphlet by the centre-right Centre for Policy Studies published this week</a>, the chancellor is unlikely to meet his \"fiscal mandate\", set out in his emergency budget of June 2010: the elimination of the structural budget deficit, to be assessed on a rolling five-year basis, ensuring that debt as a share of GDP is falling by the final year of his mandate in 2015-16.</p> <p>But Cameron is resisting pressure to follow the example of Labour's Harold Wilson who swapped the holders of two great offices of state after a failure of economic policy.</p> <p>Jim Callaghan, chancellor during the 1967 devaluation of sterling, swapped places with Roy Jenkins to become home secretary. Within nine years, Callaghan was prime minister. One Tory MP told the Guardian last week that Cameron would \"delay the inevitable\" by a year if he resisted this job swap.</p> <p>Downing Street sources say the reshuffle will involve more than tinkering with the cabinet. It is expected that three cabinet ministers \u2013 the Welsh secretary Cheryl Gillan, the leader of the commons Sir George Young and the chief whip Patrick McLoughlin \u2013 will return to the backbenches. This will clear the way for younger figures, such as Chris Grayling and Maria Miller, to enter the cabinet.</p> <p>Some of the remaining ministers are expected to embark on a round of musical chairs. Kenneth Clarke may move from justice to replace Young; Jeremy Hunt may move from the culture department; and Lady Warsi may move on from the co-chairmanship of the Conservative party.</p> <p>Clarke is facing calls to be removed from his post as justice secretary by 28% of those polled by ICM, a relatively low percentage for such a high-profile figure. This will provide some comfort for Clarke as he fights attempts by No 10 to demote him to replace Young as leader of the House of Commons.</p> <p>The cabinet veteran, who has been involved in a series of clashes with No 10 over his liberal approach to penal policy, is making it clear in private that he still has much work to do as justice secretary. Messages are also being sent out that the prime minister, who appeared to overlook Clarke's liberal approach when he was appointed justice secretary, will harm his campaign to detoxify the Tory brand if he removes such a mainstream figure.</p> <p>Only 24% of those polled believe Hunt should lose his job. This figure will no doubt be highlighted by those Tories who believe his critics \u2013 who feel he has been too friendly to the Murdoch media empire \u2013 inhabit a small world that is of little interest to most voters.</p> <p>The cabinet ministers associated with some of the government's most controversial policies over the past two years are likely to remain in their posts. Andrew Lansley, who is facing calls from 37% of those polled to be sacked, is expected to remain as health secretary.</p> <p>Lansley has made clear that he holds the only cabinet post that interests him. It would be difficult for the prime minister to remove Lansley in this reshuffle \u2013 he could be vulnerable in a year's time \u2013 after he became a folk hero on the Tory benches where many MPs were incensed by the Liberal Democrat campaign against the health and social care bill.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the education secretary who is facing calls from 36% of those polled to leave, is widely expected to remain. Gove is a close personal ally of the prime minister who believes has been impressed with the speed with which he introduced legislation to create a new generation of free schools.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,006 adults aged 18+ by telephone on 24-26 August 2012.

  "<p>The Houses of Parliament <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/26/mps-alarmed-parliament-repairs\" title=\"\">may have to close</a>, so dire is the current state of the Palace of Westminster. Essential running repairs are carried out during summer recesses, but it is&#xa0;now thought to be more cost effective to have MPs and peers relocate for up to five years while a complete \u00a33bn renovation takes place. One proposal involves moving the Commons and the Lords to the nearby Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, but there are other options ...</p> <p><strong>A perfect replica. </strong>This may sound expensive, but there are already two fairly handy Commons stage sets \u2013 one in Oxfordshire and one in Wimbledon \u2013 that are used for film and TV production. The one in Wimbledon can also be converted to the House of Lords if necessary. There are bound to be objections to moving out of Westminster, but if things are handled right (ie, everybody gets driven to work in&#xa0;blacked-out police vans for \"security\"), MPs need never know.</p> <p><strong>The Olympic stadium. </strong>One advantage with this plan is that more spectators could see the workings of parliament in person \u2013 more, in fact, than have ever wanted to. But if each session were produced by Danny Boyle, it could become a form of constitutional monarchy worth watching.</p> <p><strong>Converted cruise ship. </strong>An offshore parliament would have many attractive tax implications for MPs, and a big boat would recreate the insular world of the Westminster bubble. All that plus dancing, karaoke, murder mystery nights and duty-free shopping.</p> <p><strong>Loads of small tents clustered around St Paul's Cathedral. </strong>A&#xa0;chance for government to steal some activist thunder by hitting the streets and staying there indefinitely. Whips can use thermal imaging equipment to make sure everyone is in his or her own tent at lights out.</p> <p><strong>Facebook. </strong>This is probably where democracy is headed anyway: instead of marching through the division lobby, MPs and peers stay at home and log&#xa0;in several times a day to pass judgment on various bits of legislation. There will be no more \"for\" or \"against\"; only \"like\" or \"share\".</p> <p><strong>Parliamentary Roadshow. </strong>End the silly season by keeping parliament in session all summer long, on the festival circuit. Transported by a fleet of buses, members and peers would sit from Glastonbury to Bestival, without missing a weekend. They will also be obliged to connect with the British public by appearing on huge stages to endure cries of \"We want Stooshe!\"</p> <p><strong>HMP Wormwood Scrubs.</strong> Obviously there's the problem of what do with all the prisoners, but they might just manage to squeeze in an extra 650 MPs by employing severe overcrowding. And after they have been banged up for six months to a year, we'll&#xa0;all start to feel a little better&#xa0;about everything.</p>",

His starting point \u2013 the lack of evidence that the Arab conquests of the seventh century were driven by Islam, as has been commonly believed \u2013 leads him towards questions that bump up against the \"Muslim story\": might Islam have evolved rather than being born fully formed; and was it the Arab conquests that in fact gave birth to Islam? <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>I Escaped A Cult<br>9pm, National Geographic<br></h2> <p>Sleep deprivation; love-bombing; sexual abuse.

RBS, Assura, Serco and Carillion, to name but&#xa0;a few, are raking in billions in taxpayer funds for leasing out and part-operating PFI hospitals, community clinics and GP surgeries that we once owned.</p> <p>Strangled by PFI debts and funding cuts, NHS foundation trusts compound their problems by entering into joint ventures. The great NHS divestiture, which began in 1990 with the introduction of the internal market and accelerated under the PFI programme, now takes the form of franchising, management buyout and corporate takeovers of our public hospitals. Virgin has been awarded \u00a3630m to provide services to vulnerable people and children in Surrey&#xa0;and Devon.

NHS staff transferred from the public to the private sector see their wages and benefits eroded. But all this is nothing compared with what is in store for patients.</p> <p>In the new world it will no longer be possible to measure coverage or fairness. Former NHS hospitals, free to generate half their income from private patients, will dedicate their staff and facilities to that end, making it impossible to monitor what is public and what&#xa0;people are paying for.</p> <p>The belief that markets distribute resources more efficiently is the basis of regional economic agreements like the European Union as well as policies imposed on developing countries by the World Bank and IMF. Britain led the way, starting with gas, water, telecoms and railways. By 2004, the whole of Whitehall was committed to putting corporations in control of what had formerly been publicly administered services. This year it is the turn of the NHS.</p> <p>Loss of public control means higher cost and fewer services, as we have learned from the toxic record of the US corporations which are now part of England's new healthcare market and helped design it.

  "<p>Germany and France have moved on Monday to bury months of squabbling over how to resolve the euro crisis by agreeing to form a joint policymaking body to create a more integrated economic and fiscal policy in the eurozone and structure a new banking supervision regime.</p> <p>The announcement of the accord in Berlin came as Germany's leading business confidence index showed a greater than expected dip due to fears of the impact of the euro's travails on German exports. It is the fourth month in a row that German business confidence has fallen.</p> <p>The German and French finance ministers, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Pierre Moscovici, said the aim of the new working group was to produce common policies on how to deal with Greece, Spain and Italy. as well as mapping out longer-term strategies. The Germans hope this will conclude in a full-scale political union within the eurozone.</p> <p>\"We want to take joint decisions,\" said Sch\u00e4uble, a Christian Democrat of the German chancellor Angela Merkel's party. Moscovici, a French Socialist, said the countries needed to \"deepen our consultations\".</p> <p>The eurozone's two biggest economies have been at odds since the election of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as French president in May. He has sought a policy shift geared to growth and jobs, while Berlin, dominating the EU response to the crisis for almost three years, has emphasised austerity, savage spending cuts and debt reduction. Monday's announcement was an acknowledgment that eurozone crisis management will be paralysed if the two biggest players remain at loggerheads.</p> <p>The announcement came as the German headline Ifo index of business sentiment fell in August to its lowest level since March 2010, dropping to 102.3 from 103.3 in July. However, the current assessment component of the index dropped by less than expected, from 111.6 to 111.2.</p> <p>The Berlin talks kicked off what promises to be a fraught and frantic few weeks in crisis management after the August holiday lull. Policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB) are to meet next week amid expectations their president, Mario Draghi, could unveil plans to intervene in the bond markets to try to cap Spain and Italy's borrowing costs.</p> <p>The following week, the European commission is to reveal new proposals for banking regulation and supervision that are likely to give extensive powers to the ECB.</p> <p>The Franco-German accord came as Spain revealed its ailing economy did worse than thought over the past two years. The country's statistics office said its economy grew by just 0.4%, rather than 0.7%. It said a recession the previous year shrank the economy by 0.3% rather than 0.1%, meaning Spain's economy has declined by about 4.5% in the four years since a housing bubble burst and the credit crunch hit in 2008.</p> <p>With economists seeing a further 2% fall in GDP over the next two years, predictions that Spain is in the middle of a lost decade now look to be accurate.

  "<p>When the rest of the convention is cancelled, what are you left with?</p> <p>Newt Gingrich started his seminar on \"Obamacare\" with a tribute to Neil Armstrong. Of course he did.

Similar seminars and panels made for a full-enough day that the absence of a larger structure wasn't entirely obvious. One noticed it more in the aimlessness of those who bothered to show up to the convention hall. Reporters, mostly, but also vaguely shell-shocked delegates, craning their necks at the \"DC celebrity\" transplants (I'd name them, but then I'd have to explain who they are) smiling gamely into cell phone cameras.</p> <p>The metaphors available in Tampa to explain the current state of the Republican party are easier to grasp than the purpose of the convention itself.

The RNC's first day was shut down because of a chaotic event beyond the organizers' control? Let me show you some Ron Paul supporters. And then there are the gusts blowing convention-goers off course: surely Todd Akin is responsible for that.

Newt U is intended to \"examine the convention's daily themes in greater detail and give delegates an opportunity to dive deeper into those issues\": issues, yes; proposed policies, no.</p> <p>Hampered by Romney's own refusal to make his agenda more specific, the Gingrich panel focused on largely disingenuous criticisms of the Obama healthcare plan (such as describing the transfer of Medicare funds as a \"cut\") and left alternate proposals lofty and ambiguous.</p> <p>\"What if we took the '200,000 apps for the iPhone' model,\" Gingrich asked, and \"asked [Americans] to develop a better solution for Medicare.\" I wonder if that would be based on Angry Birds or Twitter. (Gingrich is a noted Apple fan and obviously enamored of what he probably thinks of as their free-market approach; I guess he hasn't read their end user agreement.)</p> <p>Arguments about Medicare are attractive because of the voter base potentially swayed, but it's actually a tangential issue for the large majority of Americans.

Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Naomi Wolf:</strong> It was the gay rights movement in San Francisco in the mid-seventies that really imprinted me. It was so powerfully visual \u2013 you would see the change from one year to the next. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, one was aware of homosexual people, of course, but even in San Francisco, they lived on the margins. Nothing like militancy was attached to that concept \u2013 more like shame, or something that mainstream culture just didn't know how to grapple with. Then Prop 6 came along, and a rightwing spokeswoman made the case that gay teachers were trying to indoctrinate gay kids. By this time I was in middle and then in high school, I was very aware of the active debate around this \u2013 and aware that it sounded nuts, even to a 14-year-old \u2013 and finally I saw how gay men and women seemed to be coming out because of their outrage around this targeting and this legislative attack. It triggered a wave of militancy and a wave of what can only be called pride; suddenly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castro,_San_Francisco\">The Castro</a> was packed with beautiful young men wearing chaps and leather vests and little else, milling around in the sunshine in an atmosphere that mingled erotic validation with an emerging excitement of becoming a political force. It was so powerful to see a group of people able to wake up and say no to existing reality, to challenge the dominant debate, to assert their own identities, and to organize.</p> <p>I was also made aware of the importance of rhetoric and symbolism in activism, and also the importance of spokespeople. Many activists on the left have an antipathy toward organizing, toward hierarchies and toward spokespeople who use the media to advance their message. Indeed they seem reflexively to believe that the media always corrupts, as does hierarchy. I saw the opposite in the gay rights movement. I watched people like Harvey Milk become stars, and use their celebrity to help and support others, and lobby for their own constituencies. I also saw how when gay people organized as a voting bloc \u2013 just as how when Chinese immigrants, who were often very poor, organized as a voting bloc \u2013 they became powerhouses in the politics of the city council, and reset the city's agenda to reflect the needs of their people. I saw how fast power drained from old-money, Waspy interests who had run SF forever, as soon as these new groups organized, and as soon as they could run their own candidates accordingly. This made me be as obsessive as I am about the idea of teaching whoever wants change \u2013 from Occupy to the Tea Party to anyone, anywhere \u2013 how to do so. It is not pie in the sky, not rocket science. The gay lobby and the Chinese lobby took over big chunks of the government of my hometown, and local democracy benefited hugely as a result of this representation of otherwise silenced constituencies.</p> <p>There was a final lesson for me from the gay rights movement. I have been wrestling for a long time over the issue of why sexual freedom is political and in what ways it is important. This group's insistence that being able to tell the truth about their sexual identity was about something far bigger and more important than just sex has been hugely influential to me, and made me link sexual identity and freedom for everyone to revolutionary issues like democracy and human rights.</p>",

He put his name to the document. Centuries later, when his namesake publicly declared his support for the Memphis strikers, he didn't sign it HaveADream1963. If it was worth saying, it was worth putting your name to it.</p> <p>Yet take a glance at any comment thread on the Guardian site, YouTube or even on the government-recommended website Mumsnet, and you'll find discussion boards littered with gruesome and, crucially, anonymous mud-slinging.</p> <p>This isn't about trolls (their viciousness is merely a symptom of something more serious); this is about people who would never class themselves as abusers or hecklers, let alone \"nasty\". And yet, liberated by user-name anonymity, ordinary citizens \u2013 work colleagues, your school-gate fellow parents, your son, your mother \u2013 will type statements they would never dream of saying to the subject's face. They probably wouldn't even gossip it to mates in the pub \u2013 the mates would look away, shocked by this needless vitriol.</p> <p>So who exactly decided that pseudonymity is a crucial brick in the wall of free speech, whether on the web or elsewhere? Maybe user names once boasted a valid internet purpose. But any such justification is now thoroughly subverted, and we are left with the queasy ethics of the untended playground, where the nastiest bully wins out simply because he knows he can.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/08/court-deals-blow-to-south-korean-law-outing-internet-users-.html\" title=\"\">South Korea recently introduced a law demanding all online users identify themselves</a> before posting to message boards, a <a href=\"http://weis2011.econinfosec.org/papers/Real%20Name%20Verification%20Law%20on%20the%20Internet%20-%20A%20Poison%20or%20Cu.pdf\" title=\"\">Carnegie Mellon study</a> of the effects showed that online participation did not drop in the long term but \"uninhibited behaviours\" certainly did: \"swear words and anti-normative expressions\" were significantly reduced.</p> <p>In spite of this, last week the law was overturned by a constitutional court on the grounds that it was violating freedom of speech. This was partly because some South Koreans switched to overseas-hosted forums where their identities could remain hidden, though the research has shown that this group of individuals was \"more likely to be assertive or abusive\". In spite of the court reversal, many observers believe South Korea is ahead of the curve (as with many matters of technology) in its desire to pin names to users, that it has recognised that this is a freedom too far.</p> <p>Introducing the law, a national assembly member declared that \"internet space in our country has become the wall of a public toilet\". Toilet walls have existed almost since the beginning of time, but few have ever granted those walls the status of an unalienable democratic right. Once counter-cultural, the web has now created this bizarre synthesis of toilet wall and Tom Paine \u2013 calling on human rights to justify human unkindness, to allow full rein to the worst side of us.</p> <p>But imagine (as I have done for a new play) if all user names magically reverted to the individuals' real names. Go on, think about it \u2013 what would actually be different? What, most importantly, would be lost? What have you ever posted \u2013 on a discussion board, or Twitter or elsewhere \u2013 to which you are not willing to put your name? If user names had never been invented, would you have not still wanted to participate? How can any of us stand for the right to say something that we dare not own?</p> <p>Because this isn't idle chatter lost in the air. The internet isn't written in pencil, or even ink or even ink \u2013 it's carved in stone. Much of this character assassination remains visible forever \u2013 or certainly decades. Further, this abuse often squeezes out passionately argued commentary, and the absence of true debate debases and devalues the national dialogue. Without a name to stand behind it, free speech too easily slides into verbal delinquency. It has become too easy to be unkind, and we have lost something as a result.</p> <p>And what of whistleblowers? To this, an easy answer: the Royal Mail. Didn't whistleblowing exist before the advent of the internet? To speak freely, to be outspoken \u2013 even highly and outspokenly critical \u2013 is of course one of the most treasured rights of a free society. I'd go further: sticking your head above the parapet, saying something provocative while also being brave enough to put your name to it, is an almost euphoric pleasure. It's scary but it's honest and it's brave. It nourishes the heart.</p> <p><em>Do You Know Who Wrote This? is on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday 29 August at 2.15pm</em></p>",
  "<p>A political love triangle, awkward accordion dances, public kissing and a tweet of revenge: it was only a matter of time before Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's stranger-than-fiction private life became a French publishing phenomenon.</p> <p>A clutch of books set to hit the shelves explore the \"psychodrama\" of Hollande's relationship with his partner, the journalist Valerie Trierweiler.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy's second and third marriages spawned their fair share of bestsellers, but what is damaging for Hollande is that he promised a break from Sarkozy's style of putting his love life on display. Now writers are taking the president to task for not keeping his word.</p> <p>The key book is Entre deux Feux, by the journalists Anne Rosencher and Anna Cabana, out on Wednesday. It traces the background to the day in June when Trierweiler tweeted her support for a dissident Socialist running for election against S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, publicly displaying her animosity towards Hollande's ex-partner. It forced the love triangle on to the front pages and \"opened the door to the president's bedroom\", the authors write.</p> <p>The book describes how Trierweiler began a secret relationship with Hollande as early as 2005 when she was a political journalist covering the Socialists. Royal called her into her office to warn her off. \"Everyone says you're Fran\u00e7ois's mistress, it's unbearable for me,\" she reportedly said.</p> <p>The book claims that Hollande's transition to his new relationship was messy, and that he considered trying to get back together with Royal in 2007 after she ran for president. Trierweiler is depicted as anxious and lacking self-confidence, in the words of one Hollande ally . She is advised by a mentor to drink half a glass of wine before going on set to present her TV show. Hollande orders his entourage to reassure her, but apparently doesn't manage to reassure her himself.</p> <p>The former minister Rachida Dati points out how Sarkozy always held his wives' hands in public, whereas Hollande doesn't touch Trierweiler. During the campaign, if Trierweiler felt she wasn't getting enough attention from Hollande she would \"dramatically disappear\", the book claims, leaving Hollande asking: \"Where's Valerie?\"</p> <p>The book reveals that she sent her famous tweet from her office in the Elys\u00e9e palace while Hollande was in his own office in another wing, after berating him by phone over his support for Royal. Such was Trierweiler's resentment that she once told a Hollande biographer she would only talk to him if he didn't mention the other woman. Royal claims in the book that Trierweiler has banned Hollande from ever making her a minister.</p> <p>Another book, La Favourite, a journalist's open letter to the \"dangerous\" Trierweiler, is already out, to be followed next week by L'Ex, about Royal, The Heart of Power. Trierweiler's own book of photos from the campaign, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande President: 400 days behind the scenes of a victory, has been a sales flop.</p>",
  "<p>Philip Barlow does not recognise the descriptions of Mitt Romney, as a cold, stiff CEO. As Romney's church counsellor when the Republican presidential hopeful was a bishop in the Mormon church in Boston, Barlow saw him administer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/politics/for-romney-a-role-of-faith-and-authority.html?pagewanted=\">to the emotional and practical needs</a> of all his flock.</p> <p>\"It forces you to become intimately involved in the lives of people of all economic and racial backgrounds,\" he explains. \"People would come to him with problems: a son who's strayed from the faith, a daughter with a drug problem, marriage difficulties. I was there with him in his home, every Saturday, talking about how he would handle these problems. In his personal life he's not stiff at all.\"</p> <p>So why, given such low favourability ratings and a reputation for being out of touch, doesn't Romney draw on that experience to show his capacity for empathy?</p> <p>The gamble, explains Barlow, the Arrington chair of Mormon history and culture at the Utah State University in Logan, may be too great. \"It risks inviting more scrutiny of Mormonism. The political upside is it humanises the candidate. The political downside is it Mormonises the candidate.\"</p> <p>Now, Romney and his campaign team have decided that the risk is worth taking. This week, as Republicans gather in Tampa, Florida, to formally nominate Romney as their candidate for the White House, he will publicly embrace his religion. A Mormon bishop will perform the opening invocation on Thursday, the day of Romney's speech, and campaign officials have hinted that he will talk openly about his Mormonism.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-romney-should-not-be-afraid-to-highlight-his-faith/2012/08/06/c6a6e728-dff1-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_story.html?hpid=z3\">recent Washington Post column</a> Michael Gerson argued that given Romney's performance so far, the downsides aren't that great. \"Take away Romney's religion and you are left with Harvard, Bain and various corporate boardrooms,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"Mormonism has been one of the main stages for his leadership, as well as the main setting where he has displayed humanity. \u2026 Mormonism is the reason for Romney's rectitude, the explanation for his wholesomeness, the key to understanding his persona. Without it, he would merely be a stiff, able management consultant. Romney's reticence on religion leaves a large personal and biographical gap.\"</p> <h2>'Mormons understand why he keeps a distance'</h2> <p>The emergence of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/mitt-romney-on-the-cusp-of-making-major-mormon-history/2012/04/11/gIQAWesuAT_story.html\">a viable Mormon candidate</a> for the presidency has posed significant challenges both for the candidate and the Mormon community, the overwhelming majority of whom are members of the Church of Latter-day Saints.</p> <p>Mormons still very much see themselves as outsiders. A <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Mormon/mormons-in-america-executive-summary.aspx#family\">Pew poll in January</a> revealed that almost half believe they face a lot of discrimination \u2013 in fact they perceive themselves to be more discriminated against than black Americans \u2013 and more than two-thirds think their fellow countrymen do not regard Mormonism as part of mainstream America.</p> <p>That sense of alienation is well founded. <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Romneys-Mormon-Faith-Likely-a-Factor-in-Primaries-Not-in-a-General-Election.aspx\">Barely half of Americans</a> believe Mormonism is a Christian religion, and in an open-ended question posed in a poll last November the word most frequently used to describe Mormonism was a \"cult\".</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postpoll_022607.htm\">poll in 2007 revealed</a> that people were less likely to vote for a Mormon presidential candidate than a candidate who was female, black, twice divorced or a smoker. Only Muslims and atheists fare worse.</p> <p>Most Americans now know Romney is Mormon. Indeed they <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/2012-romney-mormonism-obamas-religion.aspx \">are more comfortable</a> with his faith than they are with Obama's (though that seems to be because a large percentage still believe he is a Muslim).</p> <p>But the group that is least comfortable with his religion \u2013 white evangelical Christians \u2013 also happens to be a crucial part of the Republican base. When he ran in 2008 opponents in South Carolina <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2104316,00.html\">someone sent fake Mormon holiday cards</a> claiming they were from him and an email from an unknown source with the subject line \"Mitt Romney has a family secret he doesn't want you to know\" that encouraged recipients to trust their \"dark suspicions\" about Mormonism.</p> <p>\"It's like quicksand for him,\" explains one long time observer. \"He can't just go there a little bit.

America is poised to pit its first black president against its first Mormon contender. They're <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/06/05/mormons-rock.html\">calling it the Mormon Moment</a>. But it doesn't seem to be a moment of unqualified joy for Mormons.</p> <p>\"There is a sense of ambivalence in the community,\" explains Paul Reeve, associate professor of history at the university of Utah. \"It signals to some Mormons that we might no longer be considered a pariah faith but instead might finally be arriving. A Mormon candidacy gives a sense of acceptance and legitimacy in mainstream American life. But there is also concern about the level of scrutiny it has brought to their faith. Every wart from Mormon history is being examined so closely it worries them.\"</p> <p>The media, they say, tend to concentrate on polygamy \u2013 which the church renounced in 1890 and only 2% of Mormons now endorse \u2013 and \"magic underwear\" \u2013 symbolically significant temple garments worn by many church members after they've taken part in an endowment ceremony. More than a third of Mormons think news coverage of their religion is unfair and more than half that they are badly portrayed in films and television. </p> <p>\"Things that are sacred to us become this awful caricature,\" says Neylan McBaine, founder of the <a href=\"http://www.mormonwomen.com/\">Mormon Women's Project</a>. \"The church membership is really feeling the weight of the Romney candidacy.\"</p> <p>If there is excitement in the Mormon community at Romney's candidacy it certainly seems muted. A <a href=\"http://utahdatapoints.com/2012/08/who-thinks-governor-romneys-candidacy-is-good-for-the-lds-church/\">recent poll found</a> that 79% of Mormons in Utah, including more than half of Democrats and almost two-thirds of independents, felt his candidacy was \"a good thing\" for the Mormon church.</p> <p>But driving around Utah \u2013 where Mormons comprise more than half the population \u2013 for a few days I saw only a handful Romney bumper stickers and not a single poster. By this time four years ago black America was awash with t-shirts casting Obama alongside Martin Luther King and Malcolm X \u2013 essentially iconising a living candidate \u2013 and psychedelic posters proclaiming hope and change. Nevertheless, Barlow believes that while the ambivalence is real, \"the dominant side of that equation is the pride. Mormons are not by and large a demonstrative people so it's a quiet pride.\"</p> <h2>Joseph Smith's visits from the angels</h2> <p>Every religion has its story. A narrative through which believers make sense of their faith. From the loaves and fishes to the creation story, religion is filled with tales of the fantastic. Every Sunday, Catholics are supposed to drink the blood and eat the flesh of Christ.</p> <p>Christians and Jews are taught that Moses parted the Red Sea and led the Israelites to the promised land. Hindus have Hanuman, the monkey god who carried an entire mountain covered with the sanjivini herb to save the life of Lakshmana. Some take them literally; for others they are metaphors. If they weren't fantastical, there would be precious little to put your faith in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395272978\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346085892837/Mormon-smith-romney-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mormon smith romney\" width=\"220\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mormon prophet Joseph Smith</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Church archives/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mormonism is no different. The religion started with Joseph Smith, a man in western New York who had many visions. During the 1820s he said an angel visited him and lead him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a Christian history of ancient American civilizations.</p> <p>It was one visit among many; he also claimed that the angels of Peter, James, John and John the Baptist visited him and endowed him with a range of priesthood authorities. Claiming that by the \"by the gift and power of God\" he translated the 500 pages in two months he published the Book of Mormon, organised the Church of Christ and was hailed as a prophet. The president of the church is still considered a prophet and God's spokesman to the world.</p> <p>Smith's small but growing band of followers were chased out of New York and settled in Kirtland, Ohio, from which they were expelled, pushing them south and west to Jackson County, Missouri. Attempts to lay down roots there were scuppered when the governor issued a \"Mormon extermination order\" insisting they must \"be treated as enemies\".</p> <p>They went north to Illinois where after a few years Smith and his brother were slaughtered by a mob. Brigham Young then took over and lead them westward where they settled in what was then Mexican land and would later become the state of Utah.</p> <p>\"Even though more than a century has passed and we don't face anything like that level of persecution now there's a live nerve ending in the Mormon consciousness that's informed by that history,\" explains Barlow, \"that does make us more sensitive to being misrepresented.\"</p> <h2>In five elections, no Democrat has broken 35% in Utah</h2> <p>Mormons were not always considered conservative. The church drew significant fire for its opposition to slavery although it went on to exclude people of African descent from both the priesthood and participation in temple ceremonies until 1978. \"Through the 19th century there was an attempt to insulate themselves from capitalism through communalism,\" says Reeve.</p> <p>In the post-war era the church comprised a significant portion of Democrats. In 1964 Lyndon Johnson won Utah; in 1960 Kennedy got 45%. But with the late '60s came the sexual revolution: women's rights, abortion, gay liberation and divorce. With little doctrinal room for manoeuvre on these social issues Mormons increasingly identified with the Republican Party.</p> <p>In the last five elections no Democratic candidate has broken 35% in Utah. \"Mormons have their idiosyncratic dimensions that are particular to the faith but they are all part of a piece of that broader American story,\" says Barlow.</p> <p>Today there are 14 million Mormons worldwide, less than half of whom live in the US. Comprising just 2% of the US population they are no monolithic group. One in 7 is not white; slightly more than that are Democrats or lean that way; a quarter do not live in the west; and one in 10 is divorced or separated. Still, broadly speaking, they are far more likely to be conservative, educated and white than the country as a whole and more than half live in just three states: Utah, California and Idaho.</p> <p>For a group who feel excluded from the mainstream they have fared remarkably well in most sphere's of American life. Democratic senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is Mormon as is the author of the Twilight vampire series, Stephanie Meyer, and former Fox News anchor, Glenn Beck, the CEO of Jet Blue Airways, David Neeleman and the Marriott family that owns the hotel chain. (Romney is named after the Marriott founder, John Willard Marriott. Romney's first name is Willard. Mitt is his second.)</p> <p>Indeed, Romney is not the first Mormon to run for president. He's not even the first in his family \u2013 his father George, the former governor of Michigan, ran in 1968 \u2013 or the only one this year \u2013 John Huntsman, who bowed out early, is also Mormon.</p> <p>Greg Smith, a senior researcher for Pew forum on religious and public life, says the group Mormons most resemble in their feelings and attitudes are American Muslims. \"Both groups feel they are discriminated against and not fully accepted by mainstream society. But both groups are still doing quite well and are happy with their lives and generally optimistic about the future.\"</p> <p>In Armitstead Maupin's Maybe the Moon the dwarf protagonist, Cady Roth, explains her conciliatory impulses thus: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When you're my size and not being tormented by elevator buttons, water fountains and ATMs, you spend your life accommodating the sensibilities of 'normal people'. You learn to bury your own feelings and honour theirs in the hope that they'll meet you halfway. It becomes your job, and yours alone, to explain, to ignore, to forgive \u2013 over and over again. There's no way you can get around this. You do it if you want to have a life and not spend it being corroded by your own anger. You do it if you want to belong to the human race.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Every minority candidate, it seems, must at some point during their campaign allay the fears of the majority if they want to be part of the electoral race. Obama did it in Pennsylvania as he <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/obama-ferraro-wright-postracial-meets-racism\">sought to quell fears about his pastor</a>, Jeremiah Wright.</p> <p>In 1960 John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16920600\">addressed his Catholicism</a> in a now famous speech in Houston. \"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute,\" he said. \"I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me.\"</p> <p>Back in 2007 Romney claimed he wanted to give a speech on his faith but was dissuaded from doing so by his team. \"The political advisers tell me: 'No, no, no, it's not a good idea. It draws too much attention to that issue alone.'\u2009\"</p> <p>But shortly before the primaries four years ago he felt he had little choice. Having once been a frontrunner in Iowa back then he was losing ground to the lay preacher and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Given that more than half of Iowa caucus-goers in 2008 described themselves as born-again or evangelical the Romney campaign felt they had no option but to address it.</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas in 2007 Romney <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16970082\">spoke at the George HW Bush library</a> in College Station, Texas. The speech was revealing on many fronts. Like Kennedy almost 50 years earlier he emphasised that if elected he would be representing America not his church.</p> <p>\"Let me assure you that no authorities of my church, or of any other church for that matter, will ever exert influence on presidential decisions. Their authority is theirs, within the province of church affairs, and it ends where the affairs of the nation begin,\" he said.</p> <p>He also acknowledged and accepted his vulnerability on the issue. \"Some believe such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy,\" he said. \"If they are right so be it. But I think they underestimate the American people.\"</p> <p>But then came a moment when Romney had to say something that Kennedy would never have had to say (although Obama, for different reasons has also had to stress): that he considers himself a Christian. \"I believe that Jesus in the son of God and the saviour of mankind,\" he said.</p> <p>And while Kennedy saw American secularism as the bridge between his minority faith and politics, Romney argued that secularism was becoming a barrier between all faiths and politics, first caricaturing and then condemning those who advocate a strict separation between church and state.</p> <p>\"They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God,\" he said. \"Religion is seen as merely a private affair, with no place in public life. It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America \u2013 the religion of secularism. They are wrong. Freedom requires religion, just as religion requires freedom.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395272979\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346087068275/salt-lake-city-010.jpg\" alt=\"salt lake city\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mormon Temple is the centerpiece of Temple Square in Salt Lake City.

Pizac/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His positioning reflects a general shift in American political culture toward a more explicit and flamboyant expression of religiosity. But it also revealed his particular challenges as a Mormon in the Republican Party in this moment. Unlike Obama, who has generally faced racialised attacks from outside his own party, Romney is most vulnerable to anti-Mormon attacks from within his own party. In the audience that day were, among others, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, and the Reverend Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition.</p> <p>They were pleased by the speech. But not everybody was convinced. In October a prominent Texas pastor, Robert Jeffress, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/us/politics/prominent-pastor-calls-romneys-church-a-cult.html\">branded Mormonism a cult</a> and suggested Romney was not a proper Christian not long after introducing Rick Perry. \"This isn't news,\" he said. \"This idea that Mormonism is a theological cult is not news either. That has been the historical position of Christianity for a long time.\"</p> <p>\"It is only faith in Jesus Christ, in Jesus Christ alone, that qualifies you as a Christian,\" Jeffress said. \"They embraced another gospel, the Book of Mormon, and that is why they have never been considered by evangelical Christians to be part of the Christian family.\"</p> <h2>Conservatives with no alternative will vote for Romney</h2> <p>The trouble, as is always the case with prejudice, is to determine to what extent people are talking about who Romney is and to what extent they are talking about what he does. There are plenty of reasons why right wing conservatives might oppose him that have nothing to do with his denomination.</p> <p>The fact that he has taken a range of positions on abortion, gun control and provided a prototype for Obama's health-care plan would not endear him to them regardless of his religious beliefs. During his College Station speech Romney insisted that ditching his Mormon faith for something more palatable would not win him much support: \"Americans do not respect believers of convenience. Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs, even to gain the world.\" </p> <p>The trouble is <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Gingrich-website-Romney-flip-flops/2012/01/30/id/425959\">many on the right feel</a> that while he has remained true to his religion, he has done precisely this in his politics over the years.</p> <p>\"I think people's views on a generic anonymous Mormon can be quite different to their views about a particular candidate that they are familiar with,\" says Reeve.</p> <p>The question is whether the religious differences really will translate into any significant effect come polling day. \"Romney's biggest problem was in the primaries,\" says Professor John Green, a political scientist in religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio. \"When evangelicals have a conservative alternative, in say, Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum they take it. But the part of the country that would most concerned by voting for a Mormon would be even more concerned by the prospect of a second term for Obama. So they'll vote for him.\"</p> <p>And that includes pastor Jeffress. \"Given the choice between a Christian-like Barack Obama who embraces non-biblical principles like abortion and a Mormon like Mitt Romney who embraces Bible principles, there's every reason to support Mitt Romney in this election,\" <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/16/anti-mormon-pastor-endorses-romney-because-obama-opposes-the-bible/\">he said</a>. \"I think as more evangelicals are aware of what this president is doing, I think they will turn out and vote. Not for partisan reasons, but because he opposes biblical principles.\"</p>",
  "<p>'The right to know and effectively challenge the opposing case has long been recognised by the common law as a fundamental feature of the judicial process\" \u2013 so said <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=lord%20kerr%20the%20right%20to%20know%20and%20effectively%20challenge%20the%20opposing%20case&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.org.uk%2Fdata%2Ffiles%2Fresources%2F292%2Fpress130711.pdf&amp;ei=1GE7UPy8A8WV0QWh6IHwDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLQ-ZioG42Bt72NLcDCqPC1KfjnQ&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Lord Kerr in a recent supreme court judgment</a>.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/justice-and-security\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a> now going through parliament would give the government the power to decide that certain evidence in civil proceedings might cause \"damage\" or \"harm\" to the public interest, and therefore must be given in secret. It would use the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/13/prevention-terrorism-act\" title=\"\">special advocate procedure</a>, which excludes non-state parties from a hearing or from any knowledge of the secret evidence given in these <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/16/secrecy-closed-material-procedures\" title=\"\">\"closed material proceedings\"</a>. Those of us campaigning on human rights in Northern Ireland are particularly concerned about&#xa0;the impact of this legislation in our region.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland dimension is important for three reasons. First, the legislation is a breach of the common law principle of open justice, which is at least 300 years old. Second, similar measures have been trialled in Northern Ireland and led to miscarriages of justice. Third, applying this law here would add to the cover of secrecy over the past and present actions of security and intelligence agents \u2013 threatening to undermine the peace process and nurture a culture of impunity.</p> <p>The establishment of a parallel \"anti-terrorist\" justice system would lead to the kind of human rights abuses that fuelled the conflict in Northern Ireland and marginalised communities. And this legislation risks weakening the&#xa0;peace process in one crucial way. One of the gaps in that process is the&#xa0;lack of a comprehensive method of dealing with the legacy of the past, especially in terms of unsolved murders and other&#xa0;crimes. Instead there is a patchwork of&#xa0;measures, including public inquiries, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/02/northern-ireland-police-cost-of-justice\" title=\"\">historical inquiries team</a>, ongoing investigations by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the police ombudsman and inquests.</p> <p>Thankfully, the secret justice proposals do not relate to inquests. But a range of civil proceedings dealing with the legacy of the conflict would be affected, including any future judicial reviews of investigations into conflict-related deaths, challenges relating to decisions not to prosecute, and civil actions for damages that concern miscarriages of justice, cases of&#xa0;ill-treatment or unlawful killings. This legislation would in effect close off all the other legal avenues that victims or their relatives are trying to use to get at the truth.</p> <p>Many of these cases revolve around the actions of state agents \u2013 whether uniformed policemen or soldiers, or the shadow army of agents and informants recruited by a range of secret agencies during the secret war in Northern Ireland. There is a pattern emerging of covering up these activities and refusing to properly investigate cases where state agents may have been involved in unlawful killings. This pattern includes the refusal of an inquiry into the murder of the human rights lawyer Pat Finucane \u2013 the most prominent and serious collusion case admitted by the UK prime minister.</p> <p>There can be little doubt, however, that the experience of waging a 30-year dirty war within the borders of the UK has deeply corrupted the British security establishment. It is arguable that its long experience in Northern Ireland has normalised human rights abuses in the pursuit of \"counter-terrorism\". Today the dirty war is not confined to Northern Ireland but has a global theatre of operations. And, under the same lid of secrecy, a culture of impunity for the security establishment corrupts and rots the very fabric of&#xa0;democracy and the rule of law.</p>",
  "<p>Over the next week, as Republicans gather for their national convention in Tampa, Florida, we can rest assured that the Obama epithet game will be in full effect. He's a tax-and-spender; he's an inveterate expander of federal power; he's weakened America in the world; he was born in Kenya and might be a Muslim (well, you'll only hear that if Republicans pull an Akin). What they likely won't hear is the truth about why the US economy remains in mediocre shape, and who is to blame for this distressing situation.</p> <p>For that, most Americans would be wise to simply turn off the TV and pick up a copy of Michael Grunwald's exceptional new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Deal-Hidden-Change/dp/1451642326/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\">The New New Deal: The Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era</a>. Grunwald, a correspondent for Time magazine, has written what is likely the single best book to date on the inner workings of the Obama presidency and the $800bn stimulus measure (or American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) that Grunwald persuasively argues is Obama's greatest political achievement.</p> <p>That conclusion may seem odd to the casual observer of US politics. In the more than three years since it passed, the stimulus has been tagged as a boondoggle that exploded the debt and did precious little to turn around the country's economic malaise. It is derided en masse by Republicans and largely ignored by Democrats.</p> <p>But, in exhaustive detail, Grunwald points out how everything you think you know about the stimulus is wrong. While the Recovery Act created 2.5 million jobs, stopped the country's economic hemorrhaging and launched a weak recovery, its long-term, transformative impact is the real story. </p> <p>According to Grunwald, the stimulus measure was \"the biggest and most transformative energy bill in history\", and \"the biggest and most transformative education reform bill since the Great Society\". It was also a \"transformative healthcare bill\", the \"biggest foray into industrial policy since FDR\", the \"biggest expansion of antipoverty initiatives since Lyndon Johnson\", and \u2013 ironically, for a president oft-accused of raising taxes \u2013 the \"biggest middle-class tax cut since Reagan\". It rebuilt bridges and paved roads; weatherized and retrofitted homes; and spurred the move toward high-speed rail.</p> <p>It pumped an extraordinary $90bn into the clean energy industry, propelled the US battery industry and expanded rural broadband adoption. It revamped the country's unemployment system, tackled the challenges of homelessness, began the digitizing of millions of health records, and fostered education reform through the innovative Race To The Top program. It doubled renewable power generation, significantly expanded solar production and basically birthed the country's transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>In short, while Republicans blast the bill as socialist government spending run amok, the stimulus has, in just a few years, transformed America and laid the foundation for future economic growth. To paraphrase Vice-president Biden, that's \"a big fucking deal\". So, the question is: why is the first we're hearing about it?</p> <p>Although Grunwald is himself a card-carrying member of the mainstream media, he takes his fellow scribes to task on this point. By focusing on picayune stories of fraud (the stimulus was, amazingly, almost completely graft-free) and \"gotcha\" reporting on projects that sounded like boondoggles, major media outlets have largely ignored the bill's seismic impact. That, three and a half years after it was passed into law, most Americans simply have no idea what the Recovery Act wrought is a truly damning indictment of the US media.</p> <p>The other part of this story comes from across the aisle and involves the Republican party, which, with the exceptions of three senators (Collins, Snowe and Specter), voted unanimously against the bill, and which, since it passed, has repeatedly lied about its impact. Grunwald's book makes an argument that many Democrats have believed for years: that Republicans' opposition to the Recovery Act was less about ideological hostility and more about partisan politics. In a desperate effort to avoid giving Obama a political win \u2013 and cultivating the notion that it was he not Republicans who was acting as a partisan \u2013 the GOP brazenly opposed stimulus initiatives once previously supported by the party.</p> <p>Even after Obama filled the Recovery Act with Republican-favored tax cuts (which, while stimulative, are a lot less stimulative than actual government spending), it had little impact on swaying Republican senators. At the same time as Republicans were railing against the Recovery Act, they were applying for stimulus funds for their own constituents: GOP vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan is a case in point. Of course, this blanket opposition to any use of public funds as economic stimulus has continued unabated since then.</p> <p>Among those who ended up supporting the bill, the story isn't much prettier. Susan Collins is perhaps the sorriest example. A moderate Maine Republican, Collins has long cultivated an image as the sort of Republican who could reach across the aisle and work with Democrats. But in Grunwald's book, she, like virtually all of her centrist brethren, comes across as cynical, craven and more interested in casting a pose as a serious, thoughtful moderate than in actually being serious and thoughtful.</p> <p>Her position as a potential aye vote for the Recovery Act, gave Collins extraordinary leverage \u2013 leverage she exploited. She adamantly opposed new school construction in the stimulus \u2013 not because she was necessarily opposed to the idea, but because it was an effective way for her to burnish her deficit-cutting credentials. For her, and for other moderates like Ben Nelson, Olympia Snowe and a whole swath of Senate \"centrist\" Democrats, forcing Obama to reduce the stimulus below a magical number of $800bn was all about their own personal political optics; it had little to do with what was best for the country. As Arlen Specter, another of the centrist crew, said at one point:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A trillion seems scary. Even $900bn, it looks so big.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hence the final agreed-upon figure of $800bn. Heaven help the country that in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression makes policy decisions based on such ridiculous rationales.</p> <p>The result was that additional monies for programs like Head Start, healthcare for unemployed workers, high-speed rail, even preparations for a flu epidemic, all of which would have softened the economic downturn or created new jobs, were sacrificially slaughtered at the altar of \"fiscal responsibility\". While it's pretty hard to argue that even a slightly larger stimulus would have moved the country dramatically out of the economic doldrums, reading about centrist senators from both parties demanding spending cuts without any rhyme or reason, and merely to ensure that the price tag was below a made-up number of $800bn, is stomach churning. After all, the lives of real people were being affected by the political posturing of these pusillanimous centrists. Obama's then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel summed it up best:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It was all driven by Washington stupidity \u2013 not what the economy needed, just this arbitrary number of 800 [billion]. If you were at 801, you were unreasonable. If you were at 799, you were a very thoughtful person.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>All of this bring us to the present day \u2013 and why the debate over the stimulus still matters for 2012. This presidential election represents a clear choice between two very different visions about the role of government. On the one hand, there are Democrats who accept the Keynesian notion that counter-cyclical spending is essential for spurring growth and job creation in times of economic distress. On the other hand, there are Republicans who view tax cuts <em>and tax cuts only</em> as the tool for spurring economic growth and additionally are supporting massive non-defense spending cuts to the federal budget.</p> <p>Yet, the last four years have shown us the results of such contrasting policies. Until the stimulus ran its course, the US economy grew and unemployment went down, albeit haltingly. This didn't happen at a pace to put a serious dent in the downturn, but if anything, that appears the result of too little stimulus, rather than too much.</p> <p>Once Republicans were able to impose their will on the country, via Senate obstructionism and then control of the House of Representatives, they put in place more tax cuts and blocked any further government spending (even on traditional items like unemployment benefits for laid-off workers). The result will be of little surprise to austerity-bound Britons: stagnant economic growth and frustratingly high economic numbers. Indeed, the GOP's austerity policies <em>have</em> resulted in hundreds of thousands of public-sector workers losing their jobs.</p> <p>Republicans, not surprisingly, like to blame President Obama for the poor state of the US economy, but in reality, the US is living today under a Republican economy \u2013 one that comprises low taxes and curbed spending. The results speak for themselves. This is ultimately why Grunwald's book should be required reading for America's undecided voters (as well as everyone else). If you want to know what the best plan for turning around the US economy is, he has it covered.</p>",
  "<p>My mother-in-law, Ellen Nicholls, who has died aged 104, was a child of her time.

She later worked in a mill in Shipley, where the owner provided her with ballet lessons. Despite her early promise as a ballet dancer, she was never able to fulfil her potential.</p> <p>She married Sam Nicholls, a miner in Frickley Colliery. They loved going to dances together and would cycle or walk for miles to get to them. Ellen devoted her married life to supporting Sam through his gruelling shift work, and to bringing up their two sons.</p> <p>Ellen enjoyed cooking for us all and we have a letter she wrote about the Christmas cake she had sent us. It displays her wry sense of humour as she relates how she had to substitute many of the ingredients and ended up putting the rum into her tea and spilling the tea leaves into the cake mix.</p> <p>She also loved poetry; even in the week before she died she could still remember poems that she had learned off by heart at school and would recite them to her grandchildren.</p> <p>It was heart-warming to see the care that Ellen received towards the end of her life. Michelle Mottershead, the centre manager at Housing 21 Sycamore Hall, Bainbridge, where Ellen lived for some years, said: \"Ellen was simply a pleasure to know and a true character, with so many tales to tell. She wasn't afraid of saying what she wanted and she was a true perfectionist. We all respected the fact that at such a great age she would not compromise over her standards; and why should she?\"</p> <p>Sam died in 1976.

  "<p>Islamic leaders in Pakistan on Monday came out in support of a Christian girl with learning difficulties who is being held in prison, in an unprecedented public denunciation of the blasphemy law by hard-line mullahs.</p> <p>The All Pakistan Ulema Council, an umbrella group of Muslim clerics and scholars, which includes representatives from fundamentalist groups, joined hands with the Pakistan Interfaith League, which includes Christians, Sikhs and other religions, to call for justice for the girl, Rimsha, who is accused of blasphemy. They also demanded that those making false allegations be punished.</p> <p>Tahir Ashrafi, the chairman of the council, warned that the \"law of the jungle\" was gripping Pakistan, with police routinely pressured by baying mobs to register blasphemy charges, as happened in the case of Rimsha, which has made headlines around the world.</p> <p>Rimsha, 11, was charged earlier this month with desecrating the Qur'an. The issue has shocked the country's Christian population. Rimsha's own community, who were living in a mixed poor Christian-Muslim enclave in Islamabad, were driven out of their homes by a rampaging crowd.</p> <p>Rimsha's fate should become clearer on Tuesday when, following a medical examination, a report is due to be presented in court on her mental condition and her age. She is being held in a maximum security jail, where her lawyer says she is deeply traumatised and begging to be released. Her parents have also been taken into protective custody. \"We see the Rimsha as a test case for Pakistan's Muslims, Pakistan's minorities and for the government,\" Ashrafi said. \"We don't want to see injustice done with anyone. We will work to end this climate of fear.\"</p> <p>Ashrafi is also part of the leadership of the radical Defence of Pakistan Council, a coalition of Islamic organisations which includes some thinly disguised banned militant groups. The outfit campaigns against western influence and to stop Nato supplies passing through the country to Afghanistan.</p> <p>Among the other unlikely Islamist groups rallying round Rimsha is Khatm-e-Nubuwwat, which has been accused of being behind violence against another minority, the Ahmedis, an offshoot of Islam.</p> <p>\"This is the first time in the history of Pakistan that the Muslim community and scholars have stood up for non-Muslims,\" said Sajid Ishaq, chairman of the Pakistan Interfaith League. \"We are together, demanding justice, demanding an unbiased investigation. And those abusing this law should be taken care of.\"</p> <p>It is dangerous in Pakistan even to discuss blasphemy, which carries the death penalty. The law is frequently used to level false allegations in order to settle scores, with lurid tales of burning or desecrating the Qur'an levelled against religious minorities and fellow Muslims. The police and the courts are usually too afraid to investigate the validity of the claims, leading to convictions on hearsay.</p> <p>In January last year, a leading politician from the ruling Pakistan Peoples party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/salmaan-taseer\" title=\"\">Salman Taseer</a>, was gunned down by one of his bodyguards after he described the statute on blasphemy as a \"black law\" and called for the release of a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, convicted under it. Taseer's murder was condoned and even celebrated by many in Pakistan \u2013 the judge who eventually convicted his self-confessed murderer had to flee the country. Asia Bibi remains behind bars, despite the flimsiest of evidence against her.</p> <p>Pakistan's minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was also assassinated last year after he questioned the law. In 2009, after rumours of the desecration of the Qur'an, an angry mob attacked the Christians in the town of Gojra, burning at least eight alive.</p> <p>All of Rimsha's community, about 300 Christian families, are now living away from their homes, either with relatives or in makeshift shelters elsewhere in Islamabad. \"We'll never go back. We have young children. How can we go back? They won't even let us say our prayers there,\" said Zahid Pervez, whose house has been looted of its few valuable possessions. \"We will sit on the roads, for however long it takes, until we are given somewhere else to live.\"</p> <p>Another now-destitute Christian, Shaukat Masih, added: \"The fear of Gojra is in our hearts.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Free trade\" is a sacred mantra in Washington. If anything is labeled as being \"free trade\", then everyone in the Washington establishment is required to bow down and support it. Otherwise, they are excommunicated from the list of respectable people and exiled to the land of protectionist Neanderthals.</p> <p>This is essential background to understanding what is going on with the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), a pact that the United States is negotiating with Australia, Canada, Japan and eight other countries in the Pacific region. The agreement is packaged as a \"free trade\" agreement. This label will force all of the respectable types in Washington to support it.</p> <p>In reality, the deal has almost nothing to do with trade: actual trade barriers between these countries are already very low. The TPP is an effort to use the holy grail of free trade to impose conditions and override domestic laws in a way that would be almost impossible if the proposed measures had to go through the normal legislative process. The expectation is that by lining up powerful corporate interests, the governments will be able to ram this new \"free trade\" pact through legislatures on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.</p> <p>As with all these multilateral agreements, the intention is to spread its reach through time. That means that anything the original parties to the TPP accept is likely to be imposed later on other countries in the region, and quite likely, on the rest of the world.</p> <p>At this point, it's not really possible to discuss the merits of the TPP since the governments are keeping the proposed text a secret from the public. Only the negotiators themselves and a select group of corporate partners have access to the actual document. The top executives at General Electric, Goldman Sachs, and Pfizer probably all have drafts of the relevant sections of the TPP. However, the members of the relevant congressional committees have not yet been told what is being negotiated.</p> <p>A few items that have been leaked give us some insight as to the direction of this pact. One major focus is will be stronger protection for intellectual property. In the case of recorded music and movies, we might see provisions similar to those that were in the Stop Online Privacy Act (Sopa). This would make internet intermediaries like Google, Facebook and, indeed, anyone with a website into a copyright cop.</p> <p>Since these measures were hugely unpopular, Sopa could probably never pass as a standalone piece of legislation. But tied into a larger pact and blessed with \"free trade\" holy water, the entertainment industry may be able to get what it wants.</p> <p>The pharmaceutical industry is also likely to be a big gainer from this pact. It has decided that the stronger patent rules that it inserted in the 1995 WTO agreement don't go far enough. It wants stronger and longer patent protection and also increased use of \"data exclusivity\". This is a government-granted monopoly, often as long as 14 years, that prohibits generic competitors from entering a market based on another company's test results that show a drug to be safe and effective.</p> <p>Note that stronger copyright and patent protection, along with data exclusivity, is <em>the opposite</em> of free trade. They involve increased government intervention in the market; they restrict competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.</p> <p>In fact, the costs associated with copyright and patent protection dwarf the costs associated with the tariffs or quotas that usually concern free traders. While the latter rarely raise the price of a product by more than 20-30%, patent protection for prescription drugs can allow drugs to sell for hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars per prescription when they would sell for $5-10 as a generic in a free market. Patent protection increases what patients pay for drugs in the United States by close to $270bn a year (1.8% of GDP). In addition to making drugs unaffordable to people who need them, the economic costs implied by this market distortion are enormous.</p> <p>There are many other provisions in this pact that are likely to be similarly controversial. The rules it creates would override domestic laws on the environment, workplace safety, and investment. Of course, it's not really possible to talk about the details because there are no publicly available drafts.</p> <p>In principle, the TPP is exactly the sort of issue that should feature prominently in the fall elections. Voters should have a chance to decide if they want to vote for candidates who support raising the price of drugs for people in the United States and the rest of the world, or making us all into unpaid copyright cops. But there is no text and no discussion in the campaigns \u2013 and that is exactly how the corporations who stand to gain want it.</p> <p>There is one way to spoil their fun. <a href=\"http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1439/content_item/freetpp\">Just Foreign Policy is offering a reward</a>, now up to $21,100, to WikiLeaks if it publishes a draft copy of the pact.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/taliban-execute-civilians-at-party\" title=\"\">killing of 17 people</a> by Taliban insurgents in Musa Qala, the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/10-afghan-soldiers-killed-checkpoint-attack-043510948.html\" title=\"\">deaths of 10 Afghan army personnel</a> in a separate, large-scale assault in Helmand, and the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/27/world/asia/afghanistan-violence/index.html\" title=\"\">killing of two US soldiers</a> by an Afghan national army recruit could be dismissed as just another bloody day in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Alternatively these gruesome events, taken together, might sensibly be seen as another urgent warning to neglectful western politicians that their policy of gradual, go-slow withdrawal is rapidly unravelling. It is a warning they may ignore at their peril.</p> <p>Barack Obama and David Cameron have set a departure date for Nato forces of 2014. But the deteriorating security situation, the rank unreliability or underperformance of large sections of the Afghan army and police, and the fearful persistence of the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban may yet force their hand, turning ragged retreat into slow-motion rout.</p> <p>Western leaders would prefer to ignore Afghanistan. It hardly features in the US presidential contest between Obama and Mitt Romney.</p> <p>In Britain, news of each soldier's death is received with muted official regret. President Hollande of France has already washed his hands of the affair. The war has become an embarrassment, a hangover from the Bush-Blair days. More pressing issues, closer to home, now dominate.</p> <p>\"Remember the war in Afghanistan?\" <a href=\"http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/14/the_lessons_of_Afghanistan\" title=\"\">asks Stephen Walt</a>, professor of international relations at Harvard, in Foreign Policy magazine:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You know: It was the 'good war,' fought in response to al-Qaida's attack on 9/11 and the Taliban's refusal to turn them in, and subsequently justified by (1) the need to prevent future terrorist 'safe havens,' (2) the desire to liberate Afghan women, (3) the imperative to bring democracy and modern governance to an underdeveloped tribal society, and (4) as always, the need to preserve American 'credibility'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Walt suggests none of these objectives has been attained. Afghan policy is heading for the rocks, if it is not already wrecked on them, and there is scant chance that Nato will leave behind a functioning state, let alone a liberal democracy, Walt suggests.</p> <p>If the politicians are asleep at the wheel, oblivious to the dangers, the American military is not. Hence the visit to Kabul last week of the Pentagon's top soldier, General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs. His meetings with President Hamid Karzai and other top officials focused on the massive upsurge in so-called \"green-on-blue\" attacks by Afghan soldiers or police on Nato personnel.</p> <p>These \"stab-in-the-back\" attacks, allegedly orchestrated by Mullah Omar, the top Afghan Taliban leader, have reached epidemic proportions this year, with 42 foreign troops killed and dozens more injured. Eleven US soldiers have died in the past week alone. Dempsey is understood to have discussed counter-measures including an extraordinary plan for the Afghan security force, in effect, to spy on itself.</p> <p>\"Soldiers must feel that they are under the full surveillance of their leadership at all levels,\" the Afghan army chief of staff, General Sher Mohammad Karimi, said <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghans-to-spy-on-own-troops-to-stop-insider-attacks/2012/08/20/e9f93ea8-eafd-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html\" title=\"\">in an interview</a> with the Washington Post after meeting Dempsey. \"Initially, it will have a negative impact on morale, but we have to do something. We have to look seriously at every individual.\"</p> <p>But Nato commanders cannot avoid evidence that the rise in such attacks may reflect a deepening, wider hostility to the continuing foreign occupation, anger at perceived cultural affronts (such as <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/25/world/la-fg-afghanistan-koran-20120226\" title=\"\">the Qu'ran burning episode</a> earlier this year), and the continuing toll of civilian casualties caused by both Nato and the Taliban.</p> <p>According to a 2011 Pentagon analysis, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-23/-green-on-blue-attacks-show-need-for-smaller-afghan-army.html\" title=\"\">quoted by Bloomberg</a>, only about 11% of the attacks are the result of Taliban infiltration:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The majority had other causes, particularly disputes or grudges between coalition and Afghan forces \u2026 Among the causes identified in interviews with hundreds of Afghan soldiers and police officers was anger over everything from US convoy procedures, night raids and civilian casualties to widespread cursing and shooting of livestock. Even something as elemental as how to urinate while on patrol was a cultural flashpoint. US personnel, the same study found, had 'extremely negative' views of their Afghan counterparts.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Karzai and his officials blame infiltration by agents acting for Pakistan and Iran for much of Afghanistan's security problems, including Taliban atrocities like the Musa Qala beheadings. They argue their neighbours' spy agencies are intent on undermining efforts to \"stand up\" the Afghan security forces, as part of a wider struggle for power and influence in a post-2014 Afghanistan.</p> <p>Pakistan has its own Taliban problem, of course, as <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2012/0816/Taliban-attack-Pakistani-air-base-ahead-of-reported-military-operation\" title=\"\">a recent attack</a> on a military base at Minhas demonstrated. The Pakistani military is said to be preparing a big new offensive in North Waziristan, a base for militants operating in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Such an offensive is likely to greatly exacerbate Afghan security problems, at least in the short term.</p> <p>When they return from their holidays, western leaders urgently need to refocus attention on Afghanistan \u2013 before the situation spins fatally out of their control.</p>",
  "<p>It's August and they might as well stop playing now: 90 minutes into the season, it's <em>schluss</em>, <em>aus und vorbei</em>. All over. A \"relegation atmosphere\" (MoPo) has come over Hamburger SV like a cloud of toxic fumes and the accompanying newspaper stories read like obituaries.</p> <p>\"A club does away with itself, HSV have become a caricature of themselves,\" wrote Die Welt. \"Not fit for the first division,\" sniffed Hamburger Abendblatt. \"Their fiftieth year in the Bundesliga could well be their last,\" warned S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. Tabloid Morgenpost went further still: \"Sixteen weeks without the Bundesliga were not long enough as far as the Hamburg supporters were concerned. Every day at HSV without football is a good day.\"</p> <p>\"No one's ever gone down after the first game,\" argued manager Thorsten Fink on Saturday, not unreasonably. But neither a lack of perspective nor typical media knee-jerkism can be blamed for headlines such as \"naked fear\" (Morgenpost) - Hamburg's catastrophically inept 0-1 home defeat by N\u00fcrnberg was in truth only the latest low point in a painful, drawn-out decline. \"It's been a constant for two years now, there's has been no development, we haven't made one step forward,\" said midfielder Marcell Jansen with alarming honesty. \"I don't feel as if there was any progress,\" admitted sporting director Frank Arnesen.</p> <p>Fink is sticking to his \"it's all about confidence\" defence but his utterings are increasingly unpersuasive. \"We didn't believe in ourselves enough to take the lead, how can a side that's been criticised all year play well?\" he wondered. Not that criticism is the problem, however, it's the team. And those who are responsible for it.</p> <p>Jansen made the most pertinent, uncomfortable point. He understood that Hamburg needed to save money, he said, but financially lesser-equipped teams like \"Freiburg or N\u00fcrnberg were showing us how to do it\". Arnesen's ruinous work, on the other hand, has systematically down-graded the squad's capacities to the point where they were almost seen as natural relegation candidates before the first ball was kicked.</p> <p>The last remnants of the <em>ancien regime</em> - Mladen Petric, David Jarolim, Paolo Guerrero \u2013 were let go and most of the replacements don't look the part: the performances of Latvian striker Artjoms Rudnevs have been so poor in pre-season, for example, that Swedish serial non-goalscorer Marcus Berg has to lead the line once more. Per Skejlbred, signed to act as the fulcrum of the side, touched the ball a mere 33 times in 70 minutes on the pitch and won 31 per cent of his tackles. These are no so much stats as an indictment. \"It felt as if HSV played without midfield and attack,\" wrote S\u00fcddeutsche. Only Ren\u00e9 Adler in goal and, to a lesser extent, skipper Heiko Westermann performed at an adequate level.</p> <p>The nature of the 4-2 defeat against third division Karlsruhe in the cup and the unmitigated N\u00fcrnberg nightmare have made the existentialist angst that has pursued the club throughout the summer appear well-founded. \"I'm not in the mood for another season of fearing the drop\" said Jansen, knowing full well that it might happen. \"The mood is pretty bad,\" added Westermann. So bad that external help needs to be parachuted in before deadline day. In Petr Jiracek (Wolfsburg) and Milan Badelj (Dinamo Zagreb), HSV have signed two more midfielders who should improve matters in the middle of the park. Sections of the supporters and the local press also long for the return of cult hero Rafael van der Vaart. But Tottenham's demands and the player's wages make that an unrealistic prospect. In a way, that hope for a messiah figure only goes to show how steep the club's fall from grace has been.</p> <p>A difficult fixture list over the next few weeks could make the 125th anniversary celebrations at the end of September a tumultuous affair. Even if Hamburg, nick-named 'Dino' (as in dinosaur) because of their unrivalled longevity in the top flight, do survive another campaign, two rebuilds in as many years will surely require a third one, under different architects.</p> <p>Meanwhile, however, the picture's so grim that solace can't even be found in last season's running gag. After signing every Chelsea reserve bar the third deputy tea lady in 2011-12, Arnesen this summer somehow managed to miss out on Kevin De Bruyne, the most promising youngster of the current Cobham crop. The 21-year-old forward has proved an instant success since his move to the Bundesliga this summer. At Hamburg's fierce rivals Werder Bremen, no less.</p> <h2>Talking Points</h2> <p>\u2022 Mario G\u00f6tze came off the bench to give Dortmund a 2-1 win in the season's curtain-raiser against Werder on Friday night. Thomas Schaaf's men pushed the champions close after Theodor Gebre Selassie had equalised Marco Reus's opener but Klopp's men dug deep and found a great result where lesser sides might have settled for the point. Seeing Werder's Marko Arnautovic, the Austrian answer to Mario Balotelli, play so well in a wide-right position was particularly surprising, his side's lack of defensive cohesion less so.</p> <p>\u2022 Dani Schahin needed help with the lyrics of the Humba T\u00e4ter\u00e4 carnival classic that the Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf supporters wanted him to sing at the final whistle in Augsburg. Luckily, injured skipper Andreas Lambertz was able to assist the midfielder. And it's tricky stuff this, to be fair. \"Ja da gehts humba, humba, humba, t\u00e4ter\u00e4, t\u00e4ter\u00e4, t\u00e4ter\u00e4. Ja da geht\u00b4s humba, humba, humba, t\u00e4ter\u00e4,\" he whispered gently into Schahin's ear. \"It's like a holiday for this club,\" the Ukrainian-born German, a new signing from F\u00fcrth, said. There's a good chance the Fortuna contingent would have celebrated their return to the top flight after fifteen years in the nether regions regardless of the result but substitute Schahin's two beautiful strikes made being back in the big time sweeter still.</p> <p>\u2022 A regulation 3-0 win for Bayern at the Trolli stadium of plucky new boys Greuther F\u00fcrth (M\u00fcller, Madnzukic, Robben scored after a goal-less, congested first half) left little talking points, so most debate centred on off-the-pitch matters at S\u00e4benerstrasse. That loud, beeping noise that could be heard on Saturday was the sound of manager Jupp Heynckes back-tracking after confirming his departure at the end of the season in a S\u00fcddeutsche interview earlier that day. \"A new life chapter will begin in June 2013,\" the 67-year-old had told the paper, \"I didn't say that I'd would stop (coaching Bayern) then,\" he insisted in a TV interview before kick-off.</p> <p>Tied-in with those lame duck questions are tabloid reports of tensions between the coach and new sporting director. \"When all at once all the talk is of Sammer, Sammer, Sammer, it's understandable that the manager gets jealous,\" Franz Beckenbauer helpfully told Sport-Bild. The most interesting and yet predictable revelation came courtesy of an Uli Hoeness interview with FAZ, however, in which the president - who's officially not involved in the day-to-day running of the club anymore - explained how Bayern came to sign Mario Mandzukic this summer: \"He came to our attention at the Euros... It looked like [Edin] Dzeko wouldn't come off because the agents wanted so much money and everything was so complicated, so I called Kalle [Rummenigge]. What do you think of Mandzukic? He said 'hmmm'. We talked to Heynckes, he agreed as well.\" Here are Bayern's scouting strategy and their inner machinations, summed up in one paragraph.</p> <p>\u2022 Vedad Ibisevic's 88th minute penalty miss against VfL Wolfsburg was neither particularly bad nor particularly important - the problem was what came next. The ball bounced back into the Stuttgart striker's path from Diego Benaglio's save. With an open goal at his mercy, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1SgtSWytPs\" title=\"\">the Bosnian blasted it wide</a> from five metres out with the outside of his right boot. Ibisevic later disagreed that his left peg might have been the better option (\"I could have scored with anything in this situation, with my head or with the heel as well\") but admitted to \"switching off\" prematurely. \"The shooting failure joke of the season,\" screamed Bild.</p> <p>Sporting director Fredi Bobic, a former striker himself, offered a bit of perspective, courtesy of YouTube. \"These things have happened to others, you can see it on the internet, even superstars like David Beckham have slipped at the penalty spot,\" said the 40-year-old. More worst misses of the season will undoubtedly follow in due course. They're like talking cats and pancake-sized pimples, these: they don't really occur more frequently than before, it's just that instant digital proliferation makes it look that way.</p> <p>Ibisevic's evening took, it should be mentioned, took a worse turn still. Two minutes after his mishap, Wolfsburg new-boy Bas Dost scored with a header to make it 1-0 for the visitors. The unnecessary defeat could well hurt a little longer. Next week, the Swabians are up against Bayern.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Dortmund 2-1 Bremen, Gladbach 2-1 Hoffenheim, Hamburg 0-1 N\u00fcrnberg, Augsburg 0-2 D\u00fcsseldorf, Freiburg 1-1 Mainz, Greuther F\u00fcrth 0-3 Bayern, Stuttgart 0-1 Wolfsburg, Hannover 2-2 Schalke.</p> <p><a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=12\" title=\"\">Latest Bundesliga table</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/honigstein\" title=\"\">Follow Raphael Honigstein on Twitter</a></p>",
  "<p>Two years ago Danielle Brown made history by crossing over from Paralympic sport to become the first English Paralympian to win a Commonwealth Games gold medal in an able-bodied event.</p> <p>But she says the pressure on her to succeed this week when she competes in the archery contest will be much greater, and she views the Paralympics as the more prestigious event.</p> <p>Winning gold in the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games was, she says, \"an incredible moment\", but the event pales in comparison to the Paralympics. \"The Paralympics is more serious; I treat the able-bodied events more as fun,\" she says. \"The Paralympics is the most prestigious event I could compete in. I'm really proud to be part of the team.\"</p> <p>She feels irritated when she senses that people are being dismissive of the Paralympics. \"People say: 'It's great that you're competing, and taking part.' And I think, well the Paralympics isn't about giving disabled people something to do,\" she says.</p> <p>The 24-year-old Brown had a very sporty childhood; until she was 13 she was signed up for every after-school sports activity going, and spent the weekends hill walking, fell-running and cycling with her family. \"My Dad's a lunatic; he was into long-distance fell-running. That was the sort of upbringing I had. I really enjoyed sport,\" she says. \"It all got taken away from me when I became disabled.\"</p> <p>She began noticing intense pain in her feet at around 11. This then spread to her legs, and by the age of 13 the chronic pain had become so severe that she was no longer able to do any sport that involved using her legs.</p> <p>\"I've got complex regional pain syndrome in my feet, which means I'm in chronic pain all the time \u2013 so I had to give it all up. It was driving me nuts, sitting at home all the time. I wanted to do something. I didn't know about Paralympic sports and I didn't consider myself to be disabled \u2013 I didn't get diagnosed until I was 16.\"</p> <p>Her father gave her lessons as a 15th birthday present and she quickly channelled all her enthusiasm for sport into archery. Her refusal to consider herself disabled continued, and she resisted using a wheelchair until she joined the Paralympics squad, when she realised that it wouldn't necessarily represent an admission of defeat.</p> <p>\"To me it was like giving up. I don't know why I got that in my head, I decided even if I had to crawl around on my hands and knees I was going to walk. I think partly it was growing up \u2013 none of my friends were going through the disability thing. I didn't know how to deal with it,\" she says. \"I got on to the squad and the people on the squad told me 'It's not giving up, it's just managing it'.\"</p> <p>She still refuses to take any drugs to relieve the pain. \"I'm in pain all the time. I used to be on drugs, but it didn't take away much pain, and the side-effects were horrific, I felt dizzy, sick, tired. I came off them in 2006,\" she says.</p> <p>Unexpectedly the stress involved in competing in an elite competition is one of the few things that helps relieve the pain.</p> <p>\"It is an intense, burning and stabbing pain \u2026 constantly there, but it gets worse if I use my feet. Competing helps because when I'm focusing on shooting, and with the massive adrenaline rush that comes, I'm not focusing on the pain that I'm in. I suppose my archery is a relief from that,\" she says.</p> <p>Brown has combined her training with legal studies, and in 2010 she came away with a first-class law degree from the University of Leicester.</p> <p>She hasn't decided whether to go further with her law studies, pointing out that archery is more fun, and noting drily that when she listens to some of her friends talk about practising law, \"it sounds horrific\".</p> <p>She hopes the Paralympics will help improve attitudes to disability. \"I think disability is a taboo, really, a bit like racism. You never know what to say. People don't want to cause offence. But I think that attitudes are changing.</p> <p>\"I think that the British Paralympic Association has been doing a really good job at demonstrating how inspirational the athletes are.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last July, a post about a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/21/racism-row-novel-coals-pearls?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"problematic\" new book</a> came up on my Tumblr dashboard. I only paid it minimal attention \u2013 I had <a href=\"http://fuckyeah-avengers.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Avengers gifs</a> to look at, after all \u2013 but then someone else posted about it, and then another, and then another. I began to pay more attention to it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.savethepearls.com/\" title=\"\">Revealing Eden: Save the Pearls</a> is the first in a trilogy of self-published young adult novels by Victoria Foyt, in which the world as we know has drastically changed: \"the Heat\", a mysterious global happening, has wiped out most white people (the \"Pearls\" of the title). Darker-skinned people have survived this disaster thanks to their skin's melanin; they're called \"Coals\".</p> <p>Book one follows a young Pearl, Eden, who \"loathes her white skin and accepts the oppressive opinion that it is ugly, even worthless\". She wears a \"special dark coating in order to protect it from the Heat\". In an added twist, Eden must find a mate by the time she is 18, or else she will be killed. In book two, we learn that Eden's father works in a laboratory owned by a Coal (Bramford, who Eden falls in love with), where he develops the technology to enable mankind to overcome the Heat. The \"technology\" is essentially a human-animal hybrid, and Bramford becomes the first \"man-beast\" after trialling this new technology. There's also some other stuff about a terrorist Coal group, a community of near-naked rainforest-dwellers with a prophecy and some mild bestiality, too \u2013 and this is just Book One. Hoyt has also created an accompanying website to promote the book, with <a href=\"http://www.savethepearls.com/members/jamal/\" title=\"\">individual bio pages</a> to flesh out her characters' back stories. One young Coal named Jamal (sigh) notes his bucket list thusly: \"mate, turn 24, buy a new gun, become president of the FFP, destroy all Pearls\".</p> <p>It's a lot to take in.</p> <p>Foyt is hardly the first writer to use the trope of a dystopian world in young adult fiction (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a> is still doing brisk business) and for that matter, she is not even the first to do it with a twist on race: Malorie Blackman's largely excellent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noughts_%26_Crosses_%28novel_series%29\" title=\"\">Noughts &amp; Crosses</a> series does this, so we know it is possible to write a nuanced and smart book on such a foundation. I have read Foyt's book, and aside from the astonishingly bad prose, the thing that leaps out at you is the absence of self-awareness or acknowledgement of privilege. Foyt has gone for broad brushstrokes in her fictional world: from the names she's given her characters' \"races\": Coals and Pearls (oh, come on!) to the cure for all this racial strife: the creation of a black \"beast man\" (!), to the \"special dark coating\" \u2013 blackface by any other name \u2013 to the jungle-dwelling \"primitive\" tribespeople, she's gone about it all wrong. The book is littered with several \"uh, what?\" moments, as Foyt betrays her own personal biases. When the book's very premise is so steeped in privilege, it is impossible for it not to be offensive.</p> <p>Commentator Jay Smooth has a video called \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc\" title=\"\">How To Tell People They Sound Racist</a>\". In it, he talks about the \"what they did\" versus the \"what they are\" conversation. It's about separating intention from action. Foyt's stated intent was to portray the horrors of racism. There is nothing wrong with her intention, but there are huge issues with her execution. When you write about a fictional oppressed race of white people from the position of your present-day white privilege and do not acknowledge it, the results are messy. And that's what Revealing Eden is: incredibly messy. More importantly, when you receive notice from hundreds of people of colour saying so, you do not release a statement telling them they are wrong (\"how can you critique or damn a book if you haven't read it?\" she wrote. \"This kind of blind attack is exactly what creates racism. This book is meant to provoke the white community that has never experienced racism or been oppressed because they have been in the majority in this country\"), you listen, identify and acknowledge your mistakes \u2013 and do better next time. Most recently, the makers of the Twilight movies made sure to cast Native American actors in the roles of the Quileute Indian wolf pack, a deliberate move which avoided the whitewashing to which Hollywood often resorts.</p> <p>Back in February, Foyt <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victoria-foyt/interracial-relationships_b_1312303.html\" title=\"\">wrote in the Huffington Post</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What does the lack of any racial outrage or puzzlement or fervor amidst the tremendous rain of positive reviews possibly say? Conceivably, if the book had not reached the African-American community of readers, if such a category still exists, perhaps there might be some backlash. The first young African-American reader who responded to me loved the book. But then, she's the kind of free spirit who would eschew limiting herself to a single category.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Her comments remind me of Baratunde Thurston's assertion in his book, <a href=\"http://howtobeblack.me/\" title=\"\">How to Be Black</a>, that all white people need a \"Good Black Friend\" to help them through potentially problematic racial situations. Thanks to the internet, Foyt just acquired a few hundred Good Black Friends. It'd be nice if she would listen to them.</p>",

Open Road is an example of a larger company doing just this: the distributor is a joint venture between the two leading domestic theatre chains AMC and Regal (the former is being acquired by Chinese conglomerate Dailan Wanda) and has had some success this year with The Grey; not so much with Killer Elite.</p> <p>Open Road opened the action comedy Hit And Run in 10th place at the weekend and it's taken $5.9m in its first five days. While this isn't the best result in the world, much of the production costs will have been covered by international pre-sales through a company called Exclusive Media International co-run by the veteran British producer Nigel Sinclair. Pre-sales are the primary financing mechanism for the independent space and give a movie such as this a shot at a US theatrical release.</p> <h2>North American top 10, 24-26 August 2012</h2> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"\">The Expendables 2</a>, $13.5m.

  "<p>It was a dark, freezing February night this year when police officers stopped a black Ford Focus on the Forest Hill Road, near Peckham, south London. Inside were three occupants. A search revealed a loaded semi-automatic Browning gun with a bullet in the breach, the safety off and six rounds in the magazine. In the front passenger seat was the UK gangsta rapper <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giggs_%28rapper%29\" title=\"\">Giggs</a>, or Hollowman, whose real name is Nathaniel Thompson.</p> <p>All three were charged with possession with intent to endanger life. They were all found not guilty on Friday. One young man seated behind Giggs, in the back, pleaded guilty to having the gun.</p> <p>The case raises questions about how challenging it is for young men to escape their roots on the streets. Giggs grew up in deprived \"Pecknam\" (as in Vietnam), was involved in gangs and drugs in his teens and early 20s, and went to prison in 2003 for firearms offences. After prison he resolved to succeed as a rapper. His lyrics from that time are full of rage, threats and chaos: the life he knew on the streets.</p> <p>Nine years later, now a father, he's signed to XL Recordings, the label of best-selling artists such as Adele, Radiohead and the White Stripes. He won a best UK hip-hop act award in the US in 2008. His lyrics, still hard-hitting and threatening, include more mature commentary about teenage pregnancy, inner-city blight and despair. In February (when the arrest happened), his second XL album was about to come out and he was booked to perform at one of the country's largest live events, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/25/bbc-radio-one-hackney-weekend-review\" title=\"\">Radio 1's Hackney Weekend</a>, headlined by Obama White House favourite Jay-Z.</p> <p>That night, with six points on his driving licence, after a couple of drinks Giggs asked for a lift home from the Huxbear Street music studio in Brockley, where he was working. Huxbear is a new community project Giggs part-funded, with inner-city charity XLP, to give kids something to do and keep them off the streets. Given how much he stood to lose, his defence barrister argued, would Giggs, 31, drive around Peckham firing out of the window, risking 10 years in jail under an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4536358.stm\" title=\"\">indeterminate public protection</a> (IPP) sentence? The jury acquitted him.</p> <p>Many view rap music as frightening, and put guns, gangs and grime in the same bracket. Street gangs have become the latest bogeyman. The crown quoted excerpts from Giggs's songs in 2003 and 2007 to the jury at Woolwich crown court to prove he was still gang-affiliated in 2012. Was this an attempt to scare the jury? The songs are unsettling because they offer a window into a world of inner-city violence many would rather not know about. As evidence it is questionable, especially given our history of gritty, confrontational youth culture. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/dizzeerascal\" title=\"\">Dizzee Rascal</a> headlined the Olympics opening ceremony, even though his early lyrics are equally intimidating.</p> <p>Young men go off the rails in their teens; an early introduction to the criminal justice system can stigmatise them for life. Ex-offenders are often the only ones kids on the streets respect. As a result, they make powerful mentors. One former gang member I know works full-time in Lewisham turning young lives around. SOS Gangs project in Southwark has achieved good outcomes using ex-offenders to prevent young men returning to jail. Young kids in Belmarsh prison visiting hall recognised Giggs as he awaited trial, remanded in custody. But he testified that it now made him feel ashamed.</p> <p>As another poet, Larkin, wrote: \"An only life can take so long to climb / Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never.\"</p>",
  "<p>Apple will seek an injunction against the products found by the jury in its key trial with Samsung to have infringed its patents. Apple won on virtually every count, although some phones were determined not to infringe some patents; and the jury especially decided that the Galaxy Tab tablets did not infringe the \"trade dress\" of the iPad - that is, appear to be a copy. (The Galaxy Tab was determined to have infringed various of the \"utility\" patents such as the so-called \"rubber band\" patent, where when you scroll to the end of an onscreen list it seems to bounce back.)</p> <p>Apple will therefore seek an injunction against 17 phones and their variants that are sold by Samsung. It had claimed $2.5bn in damages; the jury knocked that down to $1.05bn, because - according to the foreman - they thought Apple's estimate of Samsung's margins was too large. (The jury included people with expertise in legal and engineering work.)</p> <p>How much will that hurt Samsung? <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/all-products\">According to its US website</a>, it sells 152 different mobile phones and smartphones.</p> <p>So what will its page of phones look like if Apple succeeds with its injunction? It's worth pointing out that the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Note aren't affected by the injunction - they weren't part of the lawsuit.</p> <p>However, high-profile phones such as the Galaxy S2, Galaxy S, and Nexus S (designed to Google's specification) are included. </p> <p>In a statement after the verdict, Samsung said in part: \"Today's verdict should not be viewed as a win for Apple, but as a loss for the American consumer. It will lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices. It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies.\"</p> <p>By my count, the amended list includes 39 phones described as \"smartphones\", of which 35 are Android-powered and four run Windows Phone.<br> So here's what Samsung's mobile lineup in the US will look like if Apple's injunction succeeds: (if the image isn't appearing on your platform, <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/26/1346016309171/samsung-injuncted_copy-460.jpg\">view it here</a>; note that it is very long):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395245826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/26/1346016309171/samsung-injuncted_copy-460.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram of Samsung mobile phones in US\" width=\"460\" height=\"10628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If Apple succeeds in banning infringing Samsung phones, this is what Samsung's US lineup will look like</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samsung reckons that it shipped the largest number of both mobile phones and smartphones in the past quarter. It doesn't make the figures public, but briefs analysts with the figures it offers. </p> <p>The figures for sales in the US provided by Samsung to the court surprised a lot of those analysts, because they seemed much smaller than would be expected given the briefings that Samsung had given. But it turns out that the list of smartphones in the Apple trial only seem to count for a small fraction of its smartphone and mobile phone sales in the US.</p>",
  "<p>The British prime minister wants us to <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/david-cameron-new-york-university/\" title=\"\">stop talking about the quantity of aid we give</a>, and \"start talking about what I call the 'golden thread', which is you only get real long-term development through aid if there is also a golden thread of stable government, lack of corruption, human rights, the rule of law, transparent information\".</p> <p>This is not a new wheeze: David Cameron was talking about the golden thread before he was leader of the Conservative party. Although the idea has never been set out in detail, he has described in speeches what he calls \"enablers\" of development: transparency, openness, accountability, empowerment, freedom, rule of law, property rights, absence of corruption, free media, free and fair elections, trade, flexibility and civil society. (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/9257593\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/20/opening-remarks-president-obama-open-government-partnership\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> have similar ideas.)</p> <p>These ideas may reappear in the conclusions of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/28/david-cameron-development-panel\" title=\"\">UN high-level panel on the future of the millennium development goals</a>, which Cameron co-chairs, so it's important to reflect now on whether the golden thread is good development policy.</p> <p>Critics fear it is a naive restatement of economic liberalism, which says developing countries are poor because of bad policies and weak institutions. This thinking led to the policy prescriptions of the 1980s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story094/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Washington consensus</a>, now widely regarded as a failure.</p> <p>But Cameron does not intend the golden thread as a return to the 1980s. <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/toryleadership/files/cameron_to_cps_on_mcc.pdf\" title=\"\">In a 2005 speech</a> (pdf) he framed it as economic empowerment, which he explicitly contrasted with economic liberalism. What's the difference? Economic liberalism is about removing obstacles to enable firms to be more efficient; economic empowerment is about enabling society to evolve and change more rapidly and more fairly. This is not a semantic difference: the golden thread focuses on openness, transparency, accountability and a free press, none of which was ever part of the Washington consensus.</p> <p>The golden thread fits nicely with the growing interest in \"complexity\" in development. This idea, borrowed from physics and biology, <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/multimedia/detail/1426397/\" title=\"\">is explored in my online presentation</a>.</p> <p>According to this view, <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/08/what-is-development.php\" title=\"\">development</a> is what happens when an economic, social and political system improves its ability to adapt and evolve. The enablers described by Cameron are plausible candidates for the kinds of policies that could accelerate the ability of an economic and social system to evolve. His view fits the mainstream development consensus that emphasises \"country ownership\" \u2013 that lasting change comes from within developing countries, rather than through policies imposed from outside. With its emphasis on transparency and accountability, the golden thread seeks to strengthen and accelerate those internal processes.</p> <p>But as development policy, the golden thread needs more work. It has three main shortcomings. First, it stresses free markets, jobs and growth, but not other ways to encourage positive social and economic change, such as reducing inequality, tackling the power of elites, providing social protection and ensuring a strong voice for civil society. There is a streak of laissez-faire in the choice of policies that does scant justice to the idea that societies can \u2013 and should \u2013 shape their own evolution.</p> <p>Second, the golden thread has said nothing about the need for changes to the global system, not just within developing countries. Rich countries could promote open, independent, legitimate and accountable institutions internationally; stop stitching up the appointment of top jobs; encourage companies in developing countries <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/23/uk-government-development-tax-rules\" title=\"\">to pay tax</a> to support the emergence of a social contract; and reform aid to make it less likely to undermine domestic accountability. Rich countries could promote transparency by requiring companies to publish details of their payments to developing countries, and property rights by accepting that a country's people, not illegitimate leaders, <a href=\"http://wenar.info/EIA_Clean_Trade.pdf\" title=\"\">own their natural resources</a> (pdf). Rich countries could support due process and the rule of law by closing financial havens and improving information exchange between tax and law enforcement authorities. They could promote openness and an exchange of ideas by making it easier for people from developing countries to study in their schools and universities, and by improving their immigration policies; and by ensuring that intellectual property rights do not obstruct the transfer of knowledge and ideas.</p> <p>Third, and most important, the golden thread has more to say about desirable dynamics in society than how to bring them about. We have had more failures than successes trying to nurture institutional and political reform in other countries, and efforts to transplant institutions from one situation to another generally end in failure. Understanding economic, social and political change through the lens of complexity should make us modest about our ability to engineer new systems. The golden thread lacks humility about the difficulty of affecting these changes, and risks appearing to offer itself as a universal blueprint for success.</p> <p>Cameron's golden thread fits well with the view that we should do what we can to help change occur from within, not impose it from outside. It emphasises the importance of institutions and policies that may strengthen and shape change. But it would benefit from a broader understanding of how societies change (eg attacking privilege, not just further liberalising markets), appreciation of the need for policy changes by rich countries to improve conditions for change in the developing world, and greater humility about the role that outsiders can play.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>A longer version of this article appears on the </em><a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Global Development</em></a><em> website</em></p>",

But you don't need this decision, nor any of the damning internal documents uncovered during the patent case, to realize this. Just look at the devices Samsung released in response to the iPhone - for instance, the 2010 Galaxy S, pictured above. If that's not copying, the term has no meaning.</p> <p> It's tempting, after such a sweeping verdict in Apple's favor, to conclude that Samsung's decision to mimic the iPhone was a terrible mistake. The firm will now be on the hook for at least $1bn in damages, and the judge could triple that amount. Samsung will likely face sales injunctions on many of its products, and will be forced to quickly design around Apple's patents in its current and upcoming devices, if not to pay a steep licensing fee. Other companies that took inspiration from Apple - including Motorola, HTC and, at the top of the chain, Google - will also be stung by this decision.</p> <p> But if you study what's happened in the mobile industry since 2007, a different moral emerges.

And later in the piece: </p> <blockquote> <p>Samsung's decision to copy Apple has also been inarguably good for consumers.

That would delay Amuay's restart beyond the current estimate of two days.</p> <p>More than 200 homes were reported damaged by the shockwave. Some were across the street from the refinery, which is on a peninsula in the Caribbean Sea in western Venezuela.</p> <p>Puddles of petroleum mixed with water covered roads in the area. The victims from Saturday's blast included 18 national guard troops and 15 civilians; six remained unidentified. On Sunday two of the dozens of people wounded died in hospital, a national guard general told reporters. </p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, who visited the scene on Sunday, said there were still several people unaccounted for, as well as at least 35 people still in hospital, so the death toll could rise.</p> <p>As fire continued to burn on Sunday the president angrily denied claims that a strong smell of gas experienced by residents in the days preceding the explosion could have indicated a possible failure of the complex's warning system.</p> <p>\"What you say you heard suggests something that is practically impossible in an installation of this kind, the largest refinery in the world. It is completely automatised and it has thousands of responsible workers here day and night, civilians and military,\" Ch\u00e1vez said. \"There is no way that there could have been a gas leak during three or four days and that no one did anything.\"</p> <p>People living close to the refinery have spoken of a dense fog-like cloud descending in the days before the huge explosion, which sent a shockwave tearing through the surrounding area, shattering shops and homes and littering the streets with debris</p> <p>\"The smell of gas could be normal close to a refinery, especially on a windless day like Friday, but [this] wasn't,\" said Mario Theis, who worked as operations manager in the Amuay complex for more than 30 years. \"At the first hint of a gas leak sirens should go off and all access roads get closed. It didn't happen.\"</p> <p>The cause of the blast has yet to be determined but with presidential elections only six weeks away political accusations are flying. Ch\u00e1vez has said that a gas leak that concentrated into a cloud led to the explosion, while the general manager of the Paraguana refining integrated complex comprised of the Amuay and Cardon plants, Jesus Luongo, denied any negligence of maintenance practices.</p> <p>This accident and a large oil spill in the eastern state of Monagas have revived allegations from industry professionals that safety protocols and standard maintenance practices were neglected after a general strike by the company's employees in 2002 led to the firing of more than 20,000 people.</p> <p>According to Gente del Petroleo, an organisation of retired oil executives, since 2003 there have been 79 accidents in the Paraguana refining complex, where 19 workers have died and 67 have been gravely injured.</p> <p>The blast ranks as one of the deadliest oil industry accidents in recent history, approaching the toll of the 1997 fire at Hindustan Petroleum's Visakhapatnam refinery in India that killed 56, and topping the 2005 BP Texas City refinery blast that killed 15 workers.</p> <p>The state-owned PDVSA oil company is not only the lifeline of the country's economy but in recent years has moved away from its core business to operate social and housing projects for the government on a massive scale.</p> <p>\"In my time there we knew what the objectives of the oil industry were. Now PDVSA diverts its resources into politicking\" said Theis.</p> <p>According to the blogger Miguel Octavio, citing PDVSA's official 2011 annual report, the Amuay refinery was scheduled to undergo nine maintenance shutdowns but only two were conducted because of lack of parts.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, who has called for an extensive investigation into the cause of the explosion, suggested the reporting of the event could be playing into the opposition's political agenda. \"I recommend to all those who claim this [lack of maintenance] not to speculate. This all coincides with a line of opinion being generated,\" he said.</p> <p>On Saturday morning the energy minister, Rafael Ramirez, assured Venezuelans there was enough fuel in store to satisfy domestic demands and that the Amuay refinery would be operating in a maximum of two days.</p> <p>But as the flames rose up in the night sky skeptics worried that what was already deemed a tragedy could worsen.</p> <p>\"The situation is not under control. They are waiting for the fuel to extinguish itself but the neighbouring [storage] sphere could very well be heating up,\" said Alexis Acosta, who had to flee the area because of the damage done to his house by the blast. \"The safety valves might not stand the pressure.\"</p>",

Opposition and human rights activists claimed many of the dead were civilians.</p> <p>A New York Times employee in Daraya reported seeing \"scores of bodies lined up on top of each other in long thin graves moist with mud\".</p> <p>The paper quoted a 40-year-old resident, Abu Ahmad, as saying: \"The Assad forces killed them in cold blood \u2026 I saw dozens of dead people, killed by the knives at the end of Kalashnikovs, or by gunfire. The regime finished off whole families, a father, mother and their children. They just killed them without any pretext.\"</p> <p>The claimed death toll could not be independently verified, but if confirmed, it would be the worst single massacre of the civil war.</p> <p>With the world's major powers still divided on how to respond to the bloodletting, Syria's neighbours took urgent steps to try to stop the violence spreading on to their territory. Turkey temporarily closed its borders to refugees, trapping 2,000 people trying to flee the conflict on the Syrian side of the frontier, until shelters could be built to accommodate them. Jordan appealed for more international aid for looking after more than 160,000 Syrian refugees, who it said were arriving at the rate of 2,000 a day.</p> <p>The spillover into Lebanon was being held back by a fragile ceasefire in the port city of Tripoli, where Sunni-Shia clashes broke out as a result of the abduction of Lebanese pilgrims by an anti-government militia in Syria, evoking uneasy memories of Lebanon's own long civil war.</p> <p>Egypt called for a regional peace conference, including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, both supporters of the Syrian rebels, as well as Assad's main ally in the Middle East, Iran.</p> <p>Anxiety over the risks of a regional conflagration deepened further as it became clear that the violence in Syria was intensifying, with more civilians killed. The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), an opposition network, claimed that more than 200 bodies had been found in Daraya, and activists circulated a video appearing to show dozens of bodies lined up in dimly lit rooms, described in the commentary as being in the town's Abu Suleiman al-Durani mosque.</p> <p>The government, which has rejected previous allegations of atrocities, portrayed the attack as a counter-terrorism operation. \"Our heroic armed forces cleansed Daraya from remnants of armed terrorist groups,\" the state news agency said.</p> <p>The junior foreign minister responsible for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said that if the reports were verified \"it would be an atrocity on a new scale, requiring unequivocal condemnation from the entire international community\".</p> <p>The storming of Daraya followed three days of heavy bombardment by government tanks and artillery, which the opposition said killed another 70 people. The offensive appeared to be part of a larger struggle for control of the southern fringe of the capital. Residents said that government tanks on the Damascus ring-road shelled the neighbourhoods of al-Lawwan and Nahr Aisheh late into Saturday night and that there was also heavy fighting in the Ghouta suburbs to the east of the city.</p> <p>The LCC said forces loyal to Assad had killed 440 people across Syria on Saturday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based activist group drawing information from a network of monitors across Syria, put the nationwide <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/syriaohr\" title=\"\">death toll for the day at 370, including 174 civilians</a>. If confirmed, it would be one of the bloodiest days the country has suffered since the anti-Assad revolt broke out in March 2011.</p> <p>It was impossible to verify such claims because of severe Syrian government restrictions on independent or foreign media coverage.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/15/houla-killings-un-blames-syria-troops\" title=\"\">United Nations report this month into an earlier massacre at Houla</a> found that the indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations and other atrocities were \"state policy\" and claimed Assad's forces and allied Shabiha militia were involved at the highest levels in \"gross violation of international human rights\".</p> <p>The UN inquiry found that anti-Assad forces had also committed war crimes including \"murder, extrajudicial execution and torture\" but that these abuses \"did not reach the gravity, frequency and scale of those committed by government forces and the Shabiha\".</p> <p>A new <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20295\" title=\"\">Amnesty International report on the fighting in Aleppo</a>, Syria's largest city, also found that \"the overwhelming majority of victims were killed in air strikes and artillery attacks by government forces\", but it criticised rebels for using imprecise or indiscriminate weapons like mortars and home-made rockets.</p> <p>Activists in Daraya alleged that most of the victims had been summarily executed by government troops moving from house to house. \"Assad's army has committed a massacre in Daraya,\" Abu Kinan, an activist in the town, told Reuters news agency by telephone, using an alias to protect himself from reprisals. \"In the last hour, 122 bodies were discovered and it appears that two dozen died from sniper fire and the rest were summarily executed by gunshots from close range,\" he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395261471\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/26/1345991016873/Daraya-massacre-map-008.png\" alt=\"Daraya massacre map\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daraya massacre map Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activist said he witnessed the death of an eight-year-old girl, Asma Abu al-Laban, shot by army snipers while she was in a car with her parents. \"They were trying to flee the army raids. Three bullets hit her in the back and her parents brought her to a makeshift hospital. Nothing could be done for her,\" he said.</p> <p>A thorough investigation of atrocity claims can only be carried out by the international criminal court in the The Hague if it is given a mandate by the UN security council, but that has been blocked by Russia, the Assad regime's principal backer and arms supplier, together with China. Moscow and Beijing have also vetoed resolutions threatening Assad with sanctions for non-compliance with a peace plan backed by the UN and the Arab League. The last UN monitors in Damascus left earlier this month when the security council failed to agree on a new mandate for them.</p> <p>Western officials say they have largely given up on security council diplomacy and are stepping up their assistance to the fragmented opposition, though they say that assistance stops short of weapons. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are reported to be shipping arms to rebel groups, however, as the conflict continues to escalate.</p> <p>Egypt became the latest country to offer its services as a peace broker, calling for a regional conference on the crisis, aimed at bridging the Sunni-Shia divide. The new Egyptian president, Mohammad Mursi, is due in Tehran for a meeting of more than 120 countries in the Non-Aligned Movement this week. He will be the first Egyptian leader to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>While Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have all backed the mainly Sunni Free Syria Army rebels, Iran's Revolutionary Guard forces have fought alongside Assad's forces. Syria's vice president Farouq al-Sharaa met an Iranian delegation on Sunday, according to Syria's state news agency, marking his first appearance in several weeks. It put an end to opposition rumours that he had defected.</p> <p>In the increasingly daunting search for a diplomatic solution, the UN and Arab League have appointed a new special envoy, a veteran Algerian diplomat, Lakhdar Brahimi, after the resignation of the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan. On Friday, Brahimi declared himself \"honoured, flattered, humbled and scared\" to be given the job.</p> <h2>Escalating violence</h2> <p><strong>February 1-8 </strong>More than 100 killed in shelling of Homs</p> <p><strong>March</strong> <strong>17 </strong>Bombs in Damascus kill more than 30</p> <p><strong>April 25</strong> Dozens killed in rocket strike on the city of Hama, central Syria</p> <p><strong>May</strong> <strong>10 </strong>At least 50 die in bomb attacks at intelligence building in Damascus</p> <p><strong>May 25</strong> More than 100 people, including children, killed in Houla, western Syria</p> <p><strong>June 6 </strong>Around 80 people killed at Qubair, near Houla</p> <p><strong>July 13</strong> Dozens of people killed in the village of Tremseh</p> <p><strong>July 18 </strong>Suicide bomber kills senior defence and security officials in Damascus</p> <p><strong>August 25 </strong>Regime accused of killing 200 at Daraya in suburban Damascus</p>"
