  "<p>In 2005, Lydia Cacho was approached by several police officers. They bundled her into a van and for the 20 hours it took to drive from Cancun in southern Mexico, where she lives, north to the city of Puebla she was, she says, \"tortured\". Sexual assault was threatened. A gun was pushed into her mouth. A sickening see-saw: \"I kept thinking one minute I was going to die, then that I would survive.\"</p> <p>When they arrived, a female guard told her she would be raped in jail. In fact, a network of friends, contacts and activists swung into action and she was bailed. Attempts on her life continued, and she has become well known as one of Mexico's bravest journalists. A recent estimate put the number killed there since 2006 at 67. Amid this, Cacho started work on her next book.</p> <p>This story tells you several things about Cacho and the world she works in: alleged corruption (tapes surfaced that appeared to show her arrest was orchestrated by a man she had written about, alleging he had connections to a paedophile ring), the vulnerability of Mexico's journalists, and that Cacho is not somebody who can be silenced. Her new book, Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking, is about to be published in the UK. Although she has lived with death threats for years, she took the most recent one four weeks ago seriously enough to leave the country.</p> <p>On 29 July, she received a call on her satellite radio from a man who told her she was a \"fucking bitch\" who had ignored their warnings, concluding: \"We are going to send you home in pieces.\" \"The way they interfered with my radio, it had to be someone who had the power and the means,\" she says. \"Immediately I called some security experts, one here in London, and told them. They said to get out of the house immediately. I&#xa0;called my lawyers and they said the same thing, so I did. I just took my passport and a bag and got out of there.\"</p> <p>Is Cacho frightened? If the question is obvious, the answer isn't. She sits across the table in an office in central London, utterly composed, an occasional flicker of rage behind dark eyes. \"I think it's absurd,\" she says. \"I'm telling the truth, I'm a good journalist and I have to flee my country.\" Later she says: \"I don't scare easily.\" She has been offered asylum in several countries \u2013 not just on this occasion, but in the past \u2013 but has never wanted to take it. \"I like my country. [In Mexico] really good journalists are so badly needed. It's important. I&#xa0;want to be there to see the change.\"</p> <p>Is she prepared for how long she might have to stay away? A deep sigh. \"I want to go back home, everything is there \u2013 my house, my dogs. I'm trying to find out who did it and expose them, which is the only thing I can do to save my life.\" She thinks this threat is related to her book, in which she names men who she says are involved in sex trafficking in Mexico.</p> <p>She travels to some of the world's sex tourism centres to piece together her story on the thriving global sex trade, much of it told through the testimonies of women and children. She met children rescued from sex slavery in Cambodia and Guatemala. A North American woman who told her how her \"employers\" \u2013 she thought she would be working as a singer in a nightclub \u2013 confiscated her visa and plane ticket and over several days kept her prisoner in a hotel room where she was drugged and raped by dozens of men. A woman from Venezuela, who escaped her traffickers in Mexico, was able to identify numerous immigration officials either as clients or those who had facilitated the passage of girls flown into the country. Dressed as a nun in Mexico City \u2013 the only safe way, she decided, for a woman to walk its mafia-controlled areas \u2013 Cacho saw children working as prostitutes in motels.</p> <p>Finding figures for the number of people trafficked and enslaved is notoriously difficult; in 2005, the International Labour Organisation said 2.4 million at any one time are trafficked into forced labour, with at least 43% of these forced to work in the sex industry, but it's a conservative estimate. \"The point of the&#xa0;book was to understand how the international markets are connected,\" she says. \"As a reporter, I was really frustrated, because every time I&#xa0;interviewed an expert, everyone kept telling me they're not linked, that this isn't an international business. But it is.\"</p> <p>She was threatened throughout her research. \"In Bangkok, I stayed in very nice hotels because it was the way to see the rich European clients who bring girls or boys to the hotel. I would be sitting in the bar, and have my camera with me, and someone would always come over, a&#xa0;waiter, saying, 'Be careful, don't do that, you're a journalist, right?' In Cambodia, I had to flee a casino and hide in my hotel.\" She tried to barricade herself into her room with furniture. \"I thought it was clever.\" She laughs. \"And then I thought: 'This is stupid, they have guns and I just have a chair against the door.'\"</p> <p>Before she started the investigation, Cacho says she was open to the idea of legalising and regulating prostitution, and had listened to many academics and feminists who advocated it. \"Then the more I travelled, and the more women I&#xa0;interviewed, the more worried I got,\" she says. \"I'm absolutely convinced that all forms of prostitution are just a way of normalising gender discrimination and violence against women, and women are 'trained' to become prostitutes because they are objects in a society that&#xa0;wants to have ghettoes of women who can be raped.\"</p> <p>She adds she doesn't really believe women can \"choose\" to become a prostitute: \"In order to make a choice, you really need to have opportunities and options. If you don't, you are not really choosing, you are just getting by.\" She says there isn't just the stereotypical idea of children and women who are abducted and enslaved (though these do, of course, exist); there are the women who are duped and find themselves owing thousands of dollars to the men who control them. Women, Cacho writes, who \"have been conditioned to sell their bodies, and believe prostitution is the only way for them to make a living\". In Cambodia, Cacho met a woman who runs a brothel who explained how she \"reprograms\" girls by \"normalising sexual exploitation through systematic exposure to pornography. They have to be convinced that they were the ones who chose to do this, and&#xa0;they must be constantly reminded that their lives are worth nothing.\"</p> <p>Even the women she met who were earning thousands of dollars, seemingly free to leave when they wanted, didn't convince her that sex work could be a rational and free labour choice. \"After a while, when you get in depth in an interview, they start telling you how miserable they are, how they are mistreated by clients, how they hate the&#xa0;smell of them, or the way the clients behave. They start giving you little stories that are stories of violence.\"</p> <p>She tries to knit together the links that stretch across the world. She met the former wife of a drug trafficker who described how young women were first exploited as prostitutes, then forced to work in their factories making illegal drugs, and how contacts were met in London, and were formed with gangs in&#xa0;Mexico and Cuba. Police in different countries have told her how many police, politicians and the judiciary are clients of brothels run by organised criminals. The tangle she portrays is overwhelming. The sex trade is growing, she says, in part \"because politicians all&#xa0;over the world are not addressing poverty. They are not really improving the lives of women and girls.\"</p> <p>One reason for the growth of pornography and prostitution, Cacho believes, is that while women's rights are improving in many places, \"the culture of masculinity has not changed at all\". The fact that there are men, she points out, from Europe and North America, who \"go to Mexico, Venezuela, Cambodia, Thailand to have sex with women there is telling you something\". She remembers a young man in Spain who explained he used prostitutes because he couldn't be bothered to talk to the women he met in&#xa0;his everyday life as equals. What she would love to see, she writes, is a \"new masculine revolution \u2026 a new generation of men, not warriors, not armed, not threatening divine punishment, not violent, but men who possess a strong sense of progress and justice\".</p> <p>Cacho was born into a large family in Mexico City. Her father was an engineer, her French mother a psychologist who was involved in the feminist movement. \"They way she saw the world was really enlightening for me,\" she says. \"It was shocking to live in a house in which equality was really implemented every day with my brothers and sisters, and then go out in to a country that didn't respect the rights of women.\"</p> <p>At 23, she became a reporter, and started writing about violence against women. \"My editor said, 'This is good, stick to that.' I thought, yes, this is what I like doing.\" In 1999, a man followed her into the bathroom of a bus station in Cancun and inflicted a brutal attack, in which she was raped and had several bones broken \u2013 an attack, she believes, that was \"punishment\" for her work.</p> <p>And so the threats continued, especially once she started trying to expose a paedophile ring in Cancun for her previous book, Demons of Eden (one of the men she wrote about, Jean Succar Kuri, was sentenced last year). For a time, she travelled in an armoured car and had federal bodyguards; she dispensed with them three years ago after her car was sabotaged. \"I lost a lot of friends and I&#xa0;respected that \u2013 they said they didn't want to be seen with me in public. My social life changed dramatically. You learn how to walk the&#xa0;street and be looking all the time for&#xa0;signs of somebody coming, like a&#xa0;motorcycle.\"</p> <p>The psychological toll is alleviated with therapy, yoga, and \u2013 until now \u2013 spending time in her garden with her dogs, \"getting in touch with the earth, life. I have a sense of humour. A lot of people think I'm weird because I can laugh about the worst things that happen \u2013 not when they're happening, but afterwards. I think that's healthy. You get cynical if you can't laugh.\"</p> <p>The risks are real. In April, her friend, the Mexican investigative journalist Regina Martinez, was killed. Anna Politkovskaya was also a friend; Cacho recalls they met two months before the&#xa0;Russian journalist was murdered in&#xa0;2006. She searches for the words: \"Reality. Shock.\"</p> <p>The only thing to do is to keep working. (She can't stop \u2013 yesterday, she says, she was in her hotel room forwarding a Facebook page she believes is used by a paedophile ring to Interpol.) As well as her writing, she has founded a women's shelter in Cancun; last year, it provided refuge or psychological and legal help to 30,000 women fleeing abuse. Cacho never wanted to become the story, but&#xa0;the threats on her life also bring a spotlight to her work, and to the dangers faced by her colleagues. \"I've never wanted a quiet life, otherwise I wouldn't be a reporter or an activist,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Of course, I get fed up with the politics and the corruption, but I never question my work. We are journalists because we want to change the world.\" She smiles. \"I think my job has made a&#xa0;difference.\"</p> <p><em>Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking by Lydia Cacho is published on 6 September by Portobello Books, priced \u00a314.99.

  "<h2>The Pajama Men, London</h2> <p>Physical comedy is just one of the many tools in the comic armoury of US duo Shenoah Allen and Mark Chavez, who have brought a series of fast-paced, genre-bending shows to these shores in their guise as the Pajama Men. Named after their habitual stage costume of blue flannel nightwear, the Men use mime, slapstick, character comedy, improv and a whole load of silly voices to realise their rarely disappointing live spectaculars. Although they're normally known for intricate plots and finely honed routines, this time they've discarded all that in favour of pure spontaneity. Each night will (in theory) see an entirely new show, prompted in true improv style by suggestions from the audience. Each show will see special guests from the world of comedy \u2013 so expect some top-quality cameos from the likes of Tony Law and David O'Doherty.</p> <p><em>Soho Theatre, W1, Mon to 15 Sep</em></p> <h2>Tim And Eric's Billion Dollar Movie, DVD</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395414136\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346326229612/Tim-And-Erics-Billion-Dol-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tim And Eric's Billion Dollar Movie \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim And Eric's Billion Dollar Movie </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you're not familiar with the offbeat retro stylings and gross-out humour of cult US show Tim And Eric, Awesome Show, Great Job (a product of cable network Adult Swim, home to Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Sealab 2021) then you may struggle to get on board with Tim And Eric's Billion Dollar Movie. For those willing to fully embrace the sicker side of comedy however, it's a spectacular showcase for the warped minds and subversive genius of creators Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim. The plot is simple: after a movie deal goes wrong, serial incompetents Tim and Eric take over a rundown shopping mall in the (misguided) hope this will allow them to make the billion dollars they owe their backers. But the movie's less about the story than the opportunity to introduce us to a cast of triumphantly bizarre characters, including great cameos from Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, and a host of nauseating gross-out gags \u2013 watch out for the helmet piercing and the diarrhoea bath.

A good time then for a nationwide tour from the performer that arguably started the whole vogue off: New Zealand-born Sam Wills. The Kiwi always performs with a titular strip of black tape planted firmly across his chops and his hugely imaginative act takes the tired old tropes of mime artistry and gives them a wickedly mischievous spin. While the act involves a fair amount of forced crowd participation, the accent is always on playful fun, so you won't need to worry too much about where you're sitting. It all makes for great live entertainment, and you wonder if there's scope to put the Boy in front of a wider audience. A one-off BBC3 special earlier this year indicated his potential on television, so let's hope the commissioners trust in his talents and allow Wills to bring his dazzlingly original, defiantly non-verbal humour to the small screen permanently.</p> <p><em>Artrix, Bromsgrove, Thu</em></p>",

  "<p>\"This is Abigail,\" says the farmer, pointing at a cow. \"She's like a lovely soppy labrador. I used to pick her up and carry her around.\" Archaeologist Alex Langlands is impressed. \"You've built up a real rapport,\" he says, peering at Abigail's matted cow hair and uncomprehending cow face. \"Bless her. Wonderful. Yes. Ha, ha!\" <strong>Wartime Farm </strong>(<em>Thursday, 8pm, BBC2</em>) is full of this sort of stuff. An eight-part tribute to the 1939-1945 pluck of our agricultural predecessors, it appears to have borrowed its MO from Abigail; draping its lovely soppy labradoriness over our slippers and nuzzling into our lap with its damp-nosed facts and historical bonhomie, even though it's actually a cow and, as such, has ruined the carpet.</p> <p>Wartime Farm follows in the hobnailed footsteps of Victorian Farm and Edwardian Farm, hugely successful living history series in which Alex, fellow archaeologist Peter Ginn and historian Ruth Goodman recreated the past by immersing themselves in the minutiae of daily life. Not for them the frivolous, slap-my-muttonchops-and-call-me-Fanny fluffery of the likes of Turn Back Time: The High Street. Here instead was rural history red in tooth and claw: the failed harvests, the fruitless jam-making sessions, the straining sows. As the buggered ploughs and botched pottage mounted, any residual rose-tinted sentimentality flaked off like the skin of a psoriatic shire horse. \"The past is a bastard,\" roared the subtext, \"but never mind because here's how to make a blanket out of paper and lard.\" And so it is with Wartime Farm, a winning attempt to recreate a year in the life of a busy Hampshire farm as it struggled, thanklessly, through the second world war.</p> <p>We arrive as autumn approaches from the lower fields. \"What a beautiful place,\" gasps Peter, shivering slightly in his back-to-school tank top, surrounded by waddling geese and barns sporting those neat, thatched, hairdo-shaped roofs that make them look like outdoor Beatles. In the opening episode, Alex and Peter set about ploughing a waterlogged wheat field while Ruth fits an unpleasant new kitchen floor. Experts drop by to deliver advice on iron reclamation while looking faintly embarrassed in tweed caps. There are wartime facts of the \"demands for increased productivity were such that the government instructed the nation's farmers to grow an additional six-and-a-half million acres of crops\" genus. Scattered throughout are cutaways of undulating hills and stoic ruminants filming exterior shots of sheep against a backdrop of yawning bees. Dull? Not a bit. It's Wartime Farm's simplicity, its literalness, its anti-fashionableness that makes it so likable.</p> <p>There are no orchestrated fall outs. No wry observations or whoops-a-daisy trombones to subvert the conceit for period lolz. There is unlikely to be a phone-in in episode five asking us to vote for the best wartime moustache, or a segment in which we're introduced to a new farmhand and it's Olly Murs and he's doing gun-fingers and talking about how his favourite bit in the second world war is, like, that bit with the beach. There are no journeys. Nobody gives it 110%. Instead, there is grumble-free manual labour, cheery make-doing and mending, chapped hands, pigs, a recipe for fried bananas, terrible trousers and genuine respect for the astonishing patience and fortitude of those who lived on, as Churchill put it, \"the frontline of freedom\". It's basically Blue Peter in a floral headscarf.</p> <p>Wartime Farm's sincerity and enthusiasm will make you want to pick up Abigail, carry her to Television Centre and plonk her on the desk of BBC2 controller Janice Hadlow stapled to a note that says MORE OF THIS SORT OF THING PLEASE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AWFUL. But it's probably best to just keep calm and carry on watching.</p>",
  "<p>My sister rings. \"I thought you might like to talk to him,\" she says. \"I came over after work and \u2026\" She trails off. There's a rustling in the background, a cushioned thud. \"Dad!\" I hear her calling. \"Dad come here. Not over there. Here. It's Bec on the phone.\"</p> <p>I wait, picturing him crashing around the bedroom of his care home. I thought he was too poorly for this.</p> <p>\"Hi, sorry \u2026\" My sister is back. \"He just tried to walk off but he's here now.\"</p> <p>\"Put him on,\" I say. It's been ages since I spoke to Dad on the phone. Before he got ill, he would ring all the time to relay snippets of his life. The progress of his tomatoes. How many boats he could see through his binoculars. His latest vendetta with a neighbour. Even after he was diagnosed, when he was still living at home, we used to speak regularly. He couldn't dial by then, but his carer would call and pass him over. I'd ask whether he'd had a pasty for lunch, how the weather was, what he'd done that day.</p> <p>As he got iller, his responses became fuzzier. \"Oh you know, that thing \u2026\" he'd say. \"That thing. Whatchamacallit.\"</p> <p>But since he moved into residential care, even these fragmentary conversations have dried up. When I tried to call the home, the staff kindly made it clear he was unable to talk.</p> <p>\"Hi? Dad?\" I say. He doesn't respond. But I can hear him breathing heavily, then clearing his throat in that familiar way. I imagine him staring at my sister for guidance. Trusting. Belligerent.</p> <p>\"Say hello,\" says my sister, patiently.</p> <p>\"Hello,\" sing-songs Dad. \"Hello?\" He sounds as if he's using the word for the first time.</p> <p>\"Hi, Dad,\" I say. \"How are you?\"</p> <p>I'm hoping for what was once his stock response: \"Not dead yet.\" But it doesn't come. Nothing comes.</p> <p>\"Sorry,\" says my sister, taking control again. \"I just thought because he was asking after you maybe it might work.\" She sounds upset.</p> <p>Then I hear it in the background.</p> <p>\"Wekker-weks. Wekker-weks.\" Dad is calling out his childhood nickname for me as if I might be hidden under the bed or in the wardrobe.</p> <p>\"Put him on again,\" I say. My stomach twists. He's asking after me. I didn't realise he still did that.</p> <p>My sister obeys. \"Dad!\" I try to inject my voice with enthusiasm. \"It's me! Wekker-weks.\" I hope that repeating it will make a connection in his sclerified brain. \"Wekker-weks?\" Dad sounds less certain now.</p> <p>\"How are you doing?\" I ask.</p> <p>There's a long pause.</p> <p>\"Drinking beer,\" he says at last. Then he chuckles.</p> <p>\"Really?\" I say. \"That's good, Dad.\"</p> <p>\"This way,\" he says. \"Going this way. Got to sort it out over there.\"</p> <p>\"Oh.\" I slump. Of course.</p> <p>\"That's right. Over there. Got to cut those hedges.\"</p> <p>There's a clatter as he discards the phone. I can hear him shuffling off, the slippers he wears all day slapping against lino. He says something else but I can't make out what it is. \"Sorry,\" says my sister again. \"I thought it might work.\"</p> <p>\"Don't be,\" I say. \"It was a nice idea.\"</p> <p>Our mutual disappointment thrums on the line. Another thing struck off the list. We hang up, but I replay the sound of him dredging up that old nickname. He was the only one who ever used it. It seems unlikely I'll hear it again.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Rebecca on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccahelenley\" title=\"\"><em>@rebeccahelenley</em></a></p>",

As the scope of his work has tightened \u2013 from the sprawling ensembles of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34488/boogie-nights\">Boogie Nights</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/81820/magnolia\">Magnolia</a></strong> through the intimate duologue of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/94083/punch-drunk-love\">Punch-Drunk Love</a></strong> to the all-consuming solipsism of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122167/there.will.be.blood\">There Will Be Blood</a></strong> \u2013 so his dedication to his craft has intensified, with his disdain for PR and celebrity marking him out as the most devout film-maker of his generation (as well as the owner of one of Wikipedia's most glitz-free \"personal life\" sections). His upcoming film <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146341/master\">The Master</a></strong>, a controversial look at the birth of a cult not entirely dissimilar to the Church of Scientology, should make that title inarguable.</p> <h2><strong>2 - Lynne Ramsay</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475768\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346244943089/Tilda-Swinton-in-We-Need--008.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton in We Need To Talk About Kevin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton in We Need To Talk About Kevin.

Kevin was a heavenly marriage of the source material and its Glaswegian director's long-running preoccupations (kids, death, guilt), allied to her startling, hypnotic visual sense. Making her feature debut with 1999's hauntingly beautiful <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79578/ratcatcher\">Ratcatcher</a></strong> (although a clutch of award-winning shorts preceded it), she's remained a critical darling ever since. Her forthcoming take on <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/oct/25/lynne-ramsay-moby-dick-space\">Moby Dick</a></strong> should be as powerful as it is personal. As Tilda Swinton says, \"She's the real McCoy.\"</p> <h2><strong>3 - Nicolas Winding Refn</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475769\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245051082/Ryan-Gosling-in-Drive-008.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Gosling in Drive\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Gosling in Drive. Photo: Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.Everett Collection / Rex Featu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like a patient zen archer, this is one film-maker who doesn't let fly until he's absolutely ready. Refn has made only nine films in 15 years but the end product is as singular as it is stunning. Refn's films look like nobody else's (although, admittedly, 2009's <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/132559/valhalla-rising\">Valhalla Rising</a></strong> was pretty Malick-like). From his brutal <strong>Pusher</strong> trilogy to the weird and wonderful anti-biopic <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126512/bronson\">Bronson</a></strong>, these films are more like art installations, shimmering with stylish violence and near-hallucinatory moments. Last year's <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142036/drive\">Drive</a></strong> suddenly made a whole lot of people remember his name, however. His next two projects also star Ryan Gosling: Thai boxing film <strong>Only God Forgives</strong>, and a remake of carousel-based 70s sci-fi <strong>Logan's Run</strong>. They will soon be sick of the sight of each other.</p> <h2><strong>4 - Joss Whedon</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475770\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245207782/Chris-Hemsworth-and-Chris-008.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in Avengers Assemble\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in Avengers Assemble.

Since then, Whedon has pulled off the rare trick of turning niche popularity into blockbuster success, with films that appease fanboys and fangirls alike while maintaining serious box-office traction. This year, Whedon pulled off a rare one-two by delivering not just one of the year's biggest hits \u2013 Marvel's <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\">Avengers Assemble</a></strong> \u2013 but one of its best-reviewed counter-programming titles, the postmodern horror-comedy <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146753/cabin-in-the-woods\">The Cabin In The Woods</a></strong>, which he wrote and produced. Though <strong>Avengers 2</strong> is pencilled in for 2015, his micro-budget B&amp;W <strong><a href=\"http://muchadothemovie.com/\">Much Ado About Nothing</a></strong> adaptation, shot in his own house in eight days and starring Whedon favourites, is due first.</p> <h2><strong>5 - Lars Von Trier</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475771\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245432579/Kirsten-Dunst-in-Melancho-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia.

In the past 10 years alone, he's turned out a nightmare-fuelling psychological horror, a shattering arthouse disaster movie, a fluffy Danish office comedy, an experimental documentary on the nature of creative endeavour and the first two parts of a trilogy about American culpability. His next project, <strong>The Nymphomaniac</strong>, is set to become the first film to feature both Shia LaBeouf and graphic scenes of unsimulated sex. No other director can straddle the arthouse/Hollywood divide with such audacity.</p> <h2><strong>6 - Jason Reitman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475772\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245529443/Charlize-Theron-in-Young--008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlize Theron in Young Adult\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlize Theron in Young Adult.

Caruso</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hollywood nepotism is a well-documented force for evil, inflicting upon the world horrors as wide-ranging as \"rapper\" Chet Haze (son of Tom Hanks) and Jaden Smith (son of Will). So Jason Reitman, offspring of Ghostbusters director Ivan, had his work cut out when he followed his father into the family business with the independent Big Tobacco satire <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/112704/thank.you.for.smoking\">Thank You For Smoking</a></strong>. In the seven years since, though, he's had four Oscar nominations and matured exponentially with each film, his efforts culminating in this year's devastating tragicomedy <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142806/young-adult\">Young Adult</a></strong>, which furnished Charlize Theron with a career-best role as embittered ghostwriter Mavis Gary. Next, he directs Kate Winslet in <strong>Labor Day</strong>. Ivan \"father of Jason\" Reitman, by contrast, was last seen churning out the Ashton Kutcher vehicle No Strings Attached.</p> <h2><strong>7 - Steve McQueen</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475773\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245664350/Michael-Fassbender-in-Sha-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Fassbender in Shame\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Fassbender in Shame.

What few could foresee was his talent with actors, drawing a career-defining performance from Michael Fassbender in the IRA drama <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/124579/hunger\">Hunger</a></strong> and following it with another in the sex-addiction story <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142860/shame\">Shame</a></strong>. In the flesh, McQueen is straightforward, imposing and hates pretension. His films, despite their beautifully composed tableaux, follow a similar template. His first two dealt with willpower and the lack of it, in that order, and his next \u2013 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/01/benedict-cumberbatch-twelve-years-a-slave\">12 Years A Slave</a></strong> \u2013 reunites him with Fassbender alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti and one Brad Pitt. The pressure will be on but don't expect McQueen to duck the issues on another hot-button movie.</p> <h2><strong>8 - Leos Carax</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475774\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245750075/Edith-Scob-in-Holy-Motors-008.jpg\" alt=\"Edith Scob in Holy Motors\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edith Scob in Holy Motors.

His two films in the 1990s, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/83322/amants-du-pont-neuf\">Les Amants Du Pont-Neuf</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/83326/pola.x\">Pola X</a></strong>, were respectively a hit and a miss, but his new film <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147447/holy-motors\">Holy Motors</a></strong> restored his crown as French cinema's arthouse counterpart to the mainstream Luc Besson. Often cryptic, sometimes boring, Carax nevertheless has a showman's touch, and though his films deal with navel-gazing issues \u2013 blocked artists are a recurring motif \u2013 it's hard to think of another film-maker whose work features hair-eating leprechauns, accordion blues solos and Kylie Minogue.</p> <h2><strong>9 - Edgar Wright</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475775\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245935982/Scott-Pilgrim-Vs-The-Worl-008.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Pilgrim Vs The World\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Pilgrim Vs The World</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two men and a dog who watched late-night 90s ITV comedy Asylum will have been alerted to his talents early on, but for the rest of us it was Spaced that first introduced us to Edgar Wright, as well as collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

  "<h2><strong>The 1-2-3-4, London</strong></h2> <p>With the problems at Bloc and cancellation of Underage, it hasn't been a golden year for festivals in east London. The 1-2-3-4, however, looks as if it may buck the trend, a one-dayer offering the suggestion that relevance is not about age but state of mind. The ethos starts at the top, with the two headline acts: Pete Shelley's melodic punk innovators Buzzcocks versus explosively dour Danish punk band Iceage. Earlier in the day, there's a similarly joyful generation gap. Underrated Dutch synth poppers Minny Pops come up against goth hipsters S.C.U.M, while luminaries of the post-punk funky left, such as Mark Stewart, face down young garage hairies like JEFF The Brotherhood.</p> <p><strong><em>Shoreditch Park, N1, Sat, </em></strong><a href=\"http://the1234shoreditch.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>the1234shoreditch.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>Patti Smith, On tour</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395477522\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346258874389/Patti-Smith-008.jpg\" alt=\"Patti Smith\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patti Smith.

If in the psycho-geographical map of Brooklyn there is one territory occupied by ecstatic tribal yawpers like Animal Collective and Yeasayer, Woods reside in that other, much indier, part where the likes of Crystal Stilts and Vivian Girls hang out. As their very good new album, Bend Beyond, goes some way to proving, though, Woods are no shambling 1986 refuseniks. With textures from psychedelic/folk rock and Big Star power pop, the classicism and growing accomplishment in their writing is insulated from smugness by an endearingly scruffy charm.</p> <p><strong><em>The Blind Tiger Club, Brighton, Sat; Cargo, EC2, Mon; Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, Tue; The Fleece, Bristol, Wed</em></strong></p> <p><em>JR</em></p> <h2><strong>The Jay Phelps Big Band, London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395477524\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346259079998/Jay-Phelps-008.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Phelps\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay Phelps.

But though Phelps likes phrasing on a trumpet the way a voice delivers a song, he's a 21st-century musician with a broad vision, and his eclectic big band is the proof. Phelps was the youngest bandleader to play the prestigious Vancouver jazz festival, and when he moved to London at 17, he was soon drawn by bassist Gary Crosby into the popular Jazz Jamaica, Nu Troop and Tomorrow's Warriors groups. As a founder member of the postbop quintet Empirical, Phelps has shown that his work can join up influences from Count Basie to Tchaikovsky via Afrobeat and Coltrane, with the input of the UK's most adventurous jazz players.

They fear a night of hot licks, self-congratulatory technique and long drum solos, and they're sometimes right. But these gigs, convened by guitarist and composer Ray Russell, promise the very best kind of pop-influenced jazz-making. Russell's film and TV music has won big awards both in Britain and the US and he's worked with the late, great American composer Gil Evans and big-time stars including Dionne Warwick and Art Garfunkel. Russell's early band-leading years in the 1970s were influenced as much by the free jazz of John Coltrane and Albert Ayler however, and that background has given his music a fire and edge many guitar hotshots lack.

It remains one of his finest achievements and it has continued to wear well. It arrives at the Proms this week, with the composer himself conducting in a staging by Paul Curran.

  "<p>Somewhere between the Ryanair redeyes, the Class As and the promotional T-shirts from record labels, dance music and style lost each other on the way to the club. When you see Ricardo Villalobos with his hair plastered to his sunglasses at 10am, or Addison Groove's pork pie hat gamely clinging to his head, the effect is one of mild nausea. So when Matthew Dear plays London's Boiler Room club night, with everyone else's clothing lumpen and translucent with sweat, it's a pleasure to see him imperious in an elegantly rumpled white collared shirt and gothic Teddy Boy hair. \"I like to wear well-tailored suits,\" he says. \"It's a hobby and passion of mine, and I think the stage is the perfect time to flex those desires, that muscle.\"</p> <p>He's flexing it again in a quilted number when we meet in a hotel bar to talk about his new album Beams. Cherubic even at 33, Dear is quick to smile, and folds himself in and out of chairs with origami poise. His music matches his look, blending the clean lines of electro and techno with the scuffed edges of songcraft and his heavily multitracked voice. Along with a small number of peers (Sasu Ripatti, Dan Snaith), Dear has the rare ability to make music that's simultaneously for the ears and for the rest of the body.</p> <p>After growing up in Texas surrounded by his older brother's New Order and Erasure records, followed by a short spell in Michigan and the usual moment of enlightenment at a warehouse rave, Dear started producing tracks around the turn of the century. Various aliases quickly cropped up, the most successful being Audion, his moniker for machine-tooled techno \u2013 his track Mouth To Mouth became ubiquitous in 2006 thanks to its throbbing clouds of noise and irresistible two-note bassline. But always, alongside these pure dancefloor tracks, would be albums of songs under his own name \u2013 his previous, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/aug/12/matthew-dear-cd-review\">Black City</a>, a melancholy, claustrophobic reflection on the Big Apple. \"New York City is a black hole, for this perspective,\" he says. \"Black City was being sucked into the black hole, and Beams is the tail of light shooting out the other side. New York is a living machine, it can chew you up and spit you out very easily \u2013 Beams is realising your place within the machine.\"</p> <p>The result is an album that's funkier, looser and wittier. \"I thought I'd write a little call to arms to everybody: let loose! Everything's a bit more amorphous in my life now, bubbly and gelatinous. I'm letting things ooze into different places. When you realise there's no clear path or answer, things just are.\"</p> <p>Like David Byrne, Chaz Jankel and Jez Kerr, Dear is one of white funk's great declarers, raffishly making gnomic observations like a pitch-shifted James Mason.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2367220&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2367220&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><br><a href=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2367220&amp;show_artwork=true\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to listen</a></p> <p>Beams arrives at a time when dance music is having one of its periodic upticks in American popular culture. What does Dear make of it all? \"I think it's phenomenal that all these people are getting into electronic music. I equate it to binge-drinking \u2013 they're taking in this music like they're drinking tons of alcohol, and they want it fast, they want it now, they want it intense. But do you continue binge-drinking until your late 20s? Probably not. You start saying, 'let's introduce some fine scotch'.\"</p> <p>As well as the hedonistic tracks on Beams then, there are also single-malt moments like Temptation, a song that assesses his relationship with his wife of seven years. \"It was expunging of the soul in that song: here I am, cut me with a sword, let me bleed, and I'll get back up and we'll move on.\"</p> <p>So you're becoming vulnerable for your wife? \"Yeah. Musicianship is a difficult journey, living far away, always being gone \u2013 there's this desire to be Don and Sherri, actually.\" Here he's referring to a single from his album Asa Breed (pictured above). \"Don And Sherri was about two people living in the middle of America, trudging through life, going to Walmart, doing the normal things. I'll never be that. So with Temptation, it's the relinquishing of those fears. I'm a highly emotional human being. It's always creeping in: love, sex, and relationships make up the basis of my songs.\"</p> <p>Where his music will head next is uncertain, particularly as he's left the city for the countryside of upstate</p> <p>New York, where he's living on a farm. \"I wanted land, freedom, quietness. I'll see an average of eight people a day, versus seeing 800 [in New York] \u2013 they're replaced by the bunny rabbits that come in my yard and eat clovers, there's deer that walk across my backyard, there's black bears in the neighbourhood, wild turkeys everywhere in the street. Those are my new friends!\"</p> <p>Is he going to go all Americana? \"Banjos and kick drums?\" he laughs. \"No, the good news is I can get as loud as I want there. I can crank it and make really driving electronic music, and not worry about my neighbours complaining.\"</p> <p>He says he wants to make another Audion album, but not in between other things (\"I'm not going to treat techno as this bastard little child that I tend to now and then\"), and that he wants to turn his lyrical focus outward: \"My life is what I sing about, but it is admittedly very, very narcissistic. I'd like to explore the outer, and get more creative. I have an anthropology degree \u2013 maybe this is where it's all coming from.\"</p> <p>Then there's his live band with a new, larger lineup, and Dear front and centre. \"I didn't want to force a fake ego, or invent someone I wasn't just to make it work on stage,\" he says. \"It's realising you have the ability to be a bit of a superhero on stage, and that's your time to be someone else, and project outwardly.\" So \"Matthew Dear\" isn't a persona, but rather a magnified part of you?</p> <p>\"Exactly, it's pieces of me. Emotion, sadness, the lover in me \u2013 it's all four corners of feeling.\"</p> <p><em><strong>Beams is out now on Ghostly International</strong></em></p>",
  "<h2><strong>Opening titles</strong></h2> <p><strong>1980s:</strong> It was one of the best credit sequences in television history, with a glamorous alchemy of split-screen character shots and sweeping panoramas of oil, cattle and skyscrapers. The Dallas theme tune, meanwhile, made horns sound like the soundtrack to pouring a satisfying cocktail over your cheating partner's head and marching away in triumph. YouTube it. Totally works.</p> <p><strong>2010s:</strong> In the 2012 \"continuation\" of the Ewing saga, the opening credits eschew new character intros for more scenes of oil and cattle. Back in the 1980s, oil and cattle meant money and power. Now burning oil fields suggest the Iraq wars and Armageddon. Footage of cattle is a reminder that we could instead be farted into oblivion.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> The end of the world is a total downer. 1980s la-la land it is.</p> <h2><strong>Use of matriarch</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395476798\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346251649702/Dallas-cast-season-1-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas cast season 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dallas, 1978-style. Photo: Everett/ Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1980s:</strong> Dallas built its sudsy storyline around the feuding Ewing family. Miss Ellie was the benign matriarch who spent her time watching her eldest son, JR, screw over the younger Bobby. Other hobbies included watching husbands die, remarrying on the Southfork ranch lawn, and being played by a different actor for a season. Everyone was too busy plotting to notice.</p> <p><strong>2010s:</strong> The new series pits old rivals JR and Bobby and their respective sons, John Ross III and Christopher, against each other. It smartly uses Miss Ellie, RIP, as a verbal cheat sheet \u2013 she's mentioned to give context and justify selling off Southfork to a conservation trust (nice guy Bobby's plan) or ripping it to bits for oil (big bad JR's).</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> 2012's reimagining of the matriarch as handy recap tool.</p> <h2><strong>The evil of JR</strong></h2> <p><strong>1980s:</strong> At its inception, Larry Hagman's JR was not the central character around whom everyone else line-danced. But by the series three \"Who shot JR?\" finale, 70 million Americans were hooked on his signature style of dastardly one-liners and references to anyone of the female sex as \"darlin\", usually before he gave said \"darlin\" a good seeing to.</p> <p><strong>2010s:</strong> He's back, aged 107, eyebrows based on Professor Dumbledore's, sex glint all model's own. He's still got it, drolly saying of a rival: \"Time has not been kind to that face, but I do recall the smell of brimstone and crazy.\"</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> 2012. The devil has the best lines.</p> <h2><strong>Socio-political climate</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395476799\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346251834811/Jesse-Metcalfe-Julie-Gonz-006.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Metcalfe, Julie Gonzalo, Josh Henderson and Jordana Brewster in the Dallas reboot\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Metcalfe, Julie Gonzalo, Josh Henderson and Jordana Brewster in the Dallas reboot.

They had sex too, but everyone kept their bras on, so it wasn't nearly as much fun as doing someone over for hard dollar.</p> <p>Life began and ended at the Texan border, with the odd Mexican ranch-hand tending horses.</p> <p><strong>2010s:</strong> Bobby's son John Ross Ewing is finding an environmentally friendly way to source oil. The child of a Mexican maid has grown up to be a scientist who can help John Ross. Even the Chinese get a mention as rivals. How very new world order.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> A tie. It's still all about Texan cowboys.</p> <h2><strong>The drunkenness of Sue Ellen</strong></h2> <p><strong>1980s:</strong> JR's ex-wife usually entered stage left, drunk, distressed and nicely turned out for the occasion.

  "<p>It's encouraging, really. Republicans in the US are displaying a growing inability to suspend disbelief. They convinced themselves that Sarah Palin was The Answer for quite a few years. They thought the Tea Party was The Answer for a much briefer time. Mitt Romney was The Answer for a couple of months, his running mate Paul Ryan lasted a couple of weeks and Clint Eastwood, the thrilling mystery guest at this week's Republican Convention, remained the man who could inspire a turning point \u2013 until he was several paragraphs into his&#xa0;speech.</p> <p>Eastwood interrogated an imaginary Barack Obama about his inability to solve problems caused by the last Republican government, including a failure to check with the Russians before invading Afghanistan or deal with the nation's 23 million unemployed. It was as if Eastwood had commissioned Stewart Lee to write his speech, and every phrase had to be assumed to be dripping with irony.</p> <p>Obviously, US politics being as weird as they are, none of this guarantees Obama will secure a second term. After all, there's as yet no proof Republicans are unable to suspend disbelief for the three seconds it takes to vote.</p>",

  "<p>My fascination with my family history was&#xa0;ignited by my Barbadian uncle, Trevor Ashby, a brown-skinned man with a perfectly topiaried afro, who was an executive with Coca-Cola on the island of Barbados.</p> <p>In my early teens, he began telling me stories of his and my&#xa0;mother's plantation childhood. Fascinated by his anecdotes, I started searching archives all over the world for details of&#xa0;my ancestors' births, deaths and marriages. My parents were interested but knew little. Undeterred, I badgered relatives I barely knew for information.</p> <p>The story that emerged was almost four centuries old and replete with drama, tragedy and grief: the story of Atlantic slavery in microcosm.</p> <p>In the late 1630s, my oldest identifiable ancestor, a young blacksmith called George Ashby, set sail from England to Barbados in search of a better life. The journey was difficult and dangerous; arrival no less so. Barbados was a wild land populated by a handful of unfettered young men with little to lose. Travelling across this small island meant hacking pathways through dense foliage in scorching heat, assailed by unfamiliar wildlife and bereft of familiar comforts. Life as a planter was exhausting and the crops he had hoped would make him rich \u2013 indigo, tobacco, cotton \u2013 barely allowed him to scrape a living.</p> <p>But then he and his contemporaries turned to sugar, and their life was transformed. A few centuries before, sugar had erupted in popularity, becoming known as \"white gold\". To meet demand, planters like George Ashby sought more cost-effective means of production, and replaced their indentured white servants with a more oppressed workforce: African slaves. The horrors these captives endured on their journey to the Americas \u2013 my African ancestors included \u2013 and the collateral damage of the trade, which cost millions of lives, has been numbered as one of history's worst atrocities.</p> <p>These \"forced migrants\" soon became more numerous than the white settlers who had initially colonised the island, a subjugated majority with every reason to hate their \"masters\": in&#xa0;response, a paranoid and oppressive society evolved. White and black lived cheek by jowl on the plantations, and in this state of intimate terror, bloodlines inevitably intermingled. Over generations, Ashby's family mutated from a traditionally English one, to a multi-hued one with white, brown and black faces. (His descendant, my great-great-great-great grandfather, had at least 15 slave children, all of whom lived and worked on his plantation.) Many of their descendants would, in their turn, migrate. Some, like my own family, ended up back in Ashby's original homeland.</p> <p>I realised that being able to trace my ancestors back to the 17th century was a gift that would allow me to show how one family was shaped by centuries of slavery and settlement. But it put me in a&#xa0;quandary. How would I make sense of this disturbing story for my children, for whom Barbados is an occasional holiday destination, a place of relaxation and family fun?</p> <p>My elder daughter, a blue-eyed, porcelain-skinned six-year-old, is at an age where she is asking questions, trying to make sense of her world and her family. She has great curiosity, but also a strong need to see the world as a&#xa0;safe and fair place. My younger child is a brown-skinned three-year-old who is just beginning to question why people have different colour skins, why she looks so different from her sister, and why it seems to matter to those around her. How do I explain that one branch of our family was&#xa0;enslaved by the other? How do I&#xa0;educate them about contemporary racism without distressing and dividing them? These are questions for every family of Caribbean descent, but equally pertinent for white British families, whose heritage is inextricably tied to the same history.</p> <p>At the moment, I have to confess, I&#xa0;have told them little, not least because I can still remember my own reaction when my parents explained what \"racial prejudice\" meant, and how shocked and frightened it made me feel. (That I was 11 at the time is a testament to how sheltered I was in my Caribbean milieu.) When I finally got around to explaining the idea that some people disliked others simply because of the colour of their skin, my outraged elder child sensibly declared: \"But Mama, it would be really boring if we all looked the same.\"</p> <p>Ultimately I want my daughters to understand both how history has made them, and how it is possible to step beyond the confines of historical legacy. I want them to comprehend the atrocities of the slave system and to recognise how the oppressors were even more debased by the process than their victims; hence their exploitation of their own kin.</p> <p>I want them to appreciate how the intertwined forces of sugar and slavery created the world we live in today, enriching Britain but also leading to the bigotry that means descendants of Africans remain disadvantaged in comparison to those who promoted the trade against them. I want to explain that these prejudices, still wielded today, have nothing do with the reality of black people's abilities or worth, but were developed to justify slavery.</p> <p>Slavery wasn't just about some people being vile to others, but was part of a global industry that had its own terrible logic and justification; a monument to the dangers of greed and venality.&#xa0;In part, too, I simply want my children to bear witness: to remember how slavery relentlessly dehumanised its victims, the systematic torture and violence, generating self-hatred and \"abolishing families\". Planters did not recognise or respect the family bonds slaves brought with them or chose to create. They abused the women they owned and treated the men as studs to create&#xa0;new workers. They separated black mothers from their children, sometimes to nurse white children. Black African culture and family life were smashed on the rocks of the Caribbean shores, and the impact of that is still felt 300 years later.</p> <p>I also want them to know that slaves were not just victims but survivors. I&#xa0;want to remind them that it was not the abolitionists alone who brought about emancipation, but the enslaved themselves. By the end of the 18th century, slave revolts exploded like fireworks across the English Americas; each disruption making slavery more untenable. I want them to salute the courage of these hundreds of thousands of forgotten rebels, such as the Jamaican slave-woman who declared, as she went into the fray: \"I know I will die but my children will be free!\"</p> <p>So why can't I just tell them in the words I&#xa0;have used here? Finding the way to have these conversations has another layer of complexity in my case as I have a very modern family. Neither of my children is biologically or genetically connected to me. One is my partner's birth child, the other ours by adoption. One is white while the other is of white and black Caribbean heritage. So there is no way of telling how they will relate to my family story. Will they see it as theirs&#xa0;by right or only borrowed?</p> <p>Will my black child feel she is able to claim it \u2013 because her own birth family heritage is likely to look similar \u2013 but my white child feel alienated by it, that she is tainted by association with the baddies? Does sharing this story of slavery risk introducing a fissure into our family unity, a feeling that the two white members are entwined with the oppressors while the two black members are associated with the victims?</p> <p>My daughters may wonder if they should absorb this family history at all. As the adopted one, the outsider gathered in, my younger child might feel my story isn't hers; my white daughter may reject exploring it out of shame. And how do I give them a healthy, critical loyalty to both my country of birth, where families like ours are not fully understood, and to their country of birth, where racism continues to run through the culture like a dark seam of coal?</p> <p>Of course, I am not in control of how my daughters will understand their heritage. What I say is only the start \u2013 they will receive messages from friends, school and the wider society about who they are and where they belong. They will have their own experiences of racism and will form their own identifications and allegiances.&#xa0;But right now, what their mum tells them is like the word of God, and I will be telling them that this story is theirs as well as mine; and that they are both part of this historical epic. Black as well as white people helped to found the country they live in; and we have worked and suffered and died for our place here.</p> <p>I want them to realise that who they are is the result of these earlier events and that they are the outcome of these people and what they did. So the three-and-a-half centuries of Atlantic slavery are just the early chapters of the story in which they now appear.</p> <p>I want them to appreciate that genetics is only one of the connections that link a family. Our families are connected in other ways: allegiances, traditions, preferences and a myriad other idiosyncrasies. That one of the things that binds us is our storytelling \u2013 and as a writer whose passion is creating narratives \u2013 I hope this will feel as important for my daughters as it feels for me. I want them to understand that love is more important than blood.</p> <p>For many people, inheritance is something we carry in our bodies \u2013 so that Great Uncle Claude's experiences are, in a&#xa0;very real sense, built into us. But there is another way of understanding how our heritage makes us who we are. It is as heirloom, a gift, a chronicle handed down between the generations, one that can easily be lost, discarded or&#xa0;reclaimed.</p> <p>Just as I see my non-biological children displaying my own traits \u2013 pulling faces as I do, or laughing at the same things, or dancing in the exact same style \u2013 so they can inherit my history.&#xa0; It is just another gift from me, alongside my love and devotion, should they choose to accept it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sugar in the Blood: A Family's Story of Slavery and Empire by Andrea Stuart is published by Portobello Books, \u00a318.99.

  "<p>The yellowing adoption papers, dated 1952 revealed for the first time the name of Sue Elliott's mother: Marjorie Phyllis Heppelthwaite. A quick flick through the London telephone directory turned up an address for \"Heppelthwaite, MP\" but Sue had heard enough about fraught reunions and did not want to pick up the phone. Instead, she asked a friend to write a tentative letter of inquiry on her behalf.</p> <p>After an exchange of letters, in 1991, biological mother and daughter met for the first time in nearly 40 years. Sue recalls that Marjorie was \"warm and spontaneous\" \u2013 and looked nothing like her. The two women formed a bond; Sue helped her birth mother move into sheltered accommodation close to her home in London and, rather guiltily, found herself spending more time with Marjorie than with her adoptive parents.</p> <p>Then, as Sue and her partner, Bevan, were planning a housewarming party for Marjorie when Sue received a letter from Kent County Council's department of social services. As soon as she saw the headed notepaper she guessed what it would reveal: Marjorie had given another child up for adoption and hadn't told her.</p> <p>\"Hello, is that my big sister?\" said Fiona, when Sue rang her.</p> <p>Fiona, who is five years younger and has a different biological father, had begun the search for her mother at the same time as Sue, but found her sister first. When the sisters met, before Fiona was reunited with Marjorie, they hit it off immediately. For Fiona, an only child, Sue was the big sister she had always longed for.</p> <p>Fiona's reunion with her biological mother was as joyful and uncomplicated as Sue's had been. \"I was stroking her hand and said, 'I'm so glad I've found you, I can't believe you're my mum,'\" she remembers.</p> <p>Perhaps both women found it easy to form a relationship with Marjorie because they came from loving adoptive families and neither had felt rejected by their biological mother.</p> <p>Included in both sisters' adoption files were heartbreaking letters from Marjorie to the adoption agency, begging for news of her daughters. \"She was such a Darling, and you can well imagine how very difficult it has been to give her up,\" wrote Marjorie of Sue in one letter.</p> <p>\"There was no question at all \u2013 she didn't want to give us away,\" says Sue.</p> <p>The one puzzle was why Marjorie hadn't told Sue that she had a sister.When Sue asked, all Marjorie would say was, \"I thought you'd think the worse of me.\"</p> <p>After all three women were reunited, the daughters jokingly asked Marjorie how many more of them there were. \"Oh, eight,\" replied Marjorie, and they all laughed.</p> <p>Throughout most of the 1990s, Sue and Fiona enjoyed spending time with Marjorie, treating her to her first ever plane flight \u2013 to Jersey \u2013 and also becoming increasingly close to each other.</p> <p>Marjorie died in 2000 and the sisters mourned together and scattered her ashes.</p> <p>Nearly two years after Marjorie's death, a recorded delivery letter arrived at Sue's door. When she saw \"East Midlands social services\" on the envelope, she burst out laughing. \"It might have been a mild hysterical reaction,\" she writes in her memoir, Love Child.</p> <p>Marjorie, it turned out, had a third illegitimate daughter in her 40th year, with a third man who also appeared to want nothing to do with the child, also given up for adoption.</p> <p>This baby, Hazel, was now in her 40s and searching for her mother. She was too late, but found two sisters instead.</p> <p>Nearly 10 years after that revelation, the three women, who have gathered at Sue's house to talk about their birth mother and the adoptions, seem as close as any sisters. When they met, there were no lightning bolts of recognition but Sue describes discovering each other's existence as a blessing.</p> <p>They wonder what it would have been like to grow up together \u2013 \"Sue would have been the mother figure,\" says Fiona.</p> <p>\"She would have been on our cases,\" says Hazel, laughing \u2013 but they don't feel cheated of a shared childhood.</p> <p>\"We haven't had to go through the jealousy or rivalry or bitching,\" says Fiona.</p> <p>And as Sue puts it, \"We came to this relationship with no baggage.\"</p> <p>Suddenly having sisters has not been without its challenges, however. Fiona admits she was unsettled when Hazel traced them because she went from being an only child who had found a longed for big sister \u2013 her \"happy ending\" \u2013 to the threatened middle child with a potential rival for Sue's affections. She fretted that \"Sue wouldn't love me as much\" until she realised that Hazel was \"totally open and honest. Out of all of us Hazel is most like Marge temperamentally,\" thinks Fiona. \"She's very even \u2013 she's lovely to be with.\"</p> <p>Hazel feels \"a sadness\" that she did not find Marjorie before her death. \"I would have loved even an hour with her. I would love to have seen her,\" she says, but insists she cannot regret not beginning her search sooner.</p> <p>As all three women guessed before they began their search, there would be profound implications for their adoptive families. Unlike Sue and Hazel, who knew they were adopted from an early age, Fiona was not told until she was 11. \"I have this memory of my mum saying, 'You do know you're adopted don't you?' At the time I didn't understand what adopted was but, ever eager to please, I said, 'Oh yes, I do,' and she said, 'We went to a place where we picked you because you were very special.'\"</p> <p>All three were given the \"special\" story; it was what adoptive parents were advised to do in the 1950s and 60s. While Sue and Hazel wrestled with feelings of guilt towards their parents over their search for their birth mother, they were soon reassured. Hazel's dad's first words were, \"I don't know why you didn't do it a lot earlier\"; her mum was also \"totally behind it\".</p> <p>Fiona experienced a more definite conflict of loyalty when she told her parents about Marjorie. \"It was very sad. My mum said, 'How could you do this? I feel betrayed.' I said, 'I did it because I was curious, I just wanted to know.'</p> <p>\"I remember her words: 'Curiosity has killed this cat'.\"</p> <p>Sue and Hazel's parents both handed down the expensive baby clothes that Marjorie had dressed them in on the day she gave them up, but Fiona does not know if she was given a special outfit; her mother refused to discuss it. She says her relationship with her now frail mum is \"OK\" but she feels \"saddened because I would have loved her support\".</p> <p>Fiona understands, however, that adoption was very different back then. Adoptive parents were told that the birth mother would never know \u2013 \"it was a shut door\" \u2013 and then the law changed in 1975, when adults were given the right to trace their biological parents. Her adoptive parents, says Fiona, \"felt betrayed by the system as well as by me\".</p> <p>The three sisters agree that they did not feel betrayed by Marjorie giving them up, but why did it happen three times?</p> <p>\"To give up one baby is hard enough but to give up three \u2026\" says Fiona. As Sue explains, Marjorie was not \"a silly young girl\": she was 30 when she had Sue, 35 when she gave birth to Fiona, and was so ashamed of being a single mother again at 40 that she lied about her age when gave up Hazel at 12 weeks.</p> <p>Sue wonders if Marjorie suffered from depression \u2013 she was a compulsive hoarder \u2013 and yet she found her to be a cheerful, loving person. Although Marjorie was \"flirty,\" laughs Sue, and \"liked men\" she believes that Marjorie spent her life fatally attracted to father figures, repeatedly choosing married or unavailable men. An only child, Marjorie was devastated by the early death of her mother and dutifully lived with her father until his death, despite a \"disastrous\" relationship with him. When she was pregnant with Sue, her father told Marjorie that she had made her bed and must lie in it.</p> <p>Why repeat that mistake \u2013 and why not fight to keep her children? Social workers told Sue that serial producers of illegitimate children are sometimes subconsciously trying to replace the baby they have lost. \"Marjorie was desperate to start a family \u2013 but didn't have luck. They say you make your own luck but she was dealt a poor hand and made some bad choices\".</p> <p>Her daughters agree that Marjorie was unassertive but few women were in those days. \"We tend to forget how pressing the moral imperative was in that era,\" says Sue.</p> <p>In the 1950s, abortion was illegal, the pill didn't exist, and the social stigma that sometimes still clings to single mothers today was off the scale \u2013 single mothers were \"fallen\" and babies born out of wedlock were \"bastards\". The few mothers who brought up babies without fathers rarely did so without the support of their family; Marjorie had no support.</p> <p>With today's emphasis on children's rights making it so easy for adopted people to find their biological parents, are the sisters sad they did not grow up in another time? \"Was it the wrong time for us?\" says Hazel. \"It was the wrong time for Marjorie.\"</p> <p>Given that Sue and Fiona formed such a positive relationship with Marjorie it seems another small tragedy that she still did not mention Hazel. Was she so fearful or pessimistic that she couldn't imagine a happy outcome? \"A lot had gone wrong in her life but she wasn't a naturally pessimistic person at all,\" says Sue. \"She just didn't want to bring it to the surface. It was so totally suppressed for her own self-preservation.\"</p> <p>When they first met, Fiona asked Marjorie if she ever thought about her. \"She said, 'Oh lovey, no, I couldn't. I had to shut you away. It would have been too painful. The only time I thought about you was on your birthday.'\"</p> <p>There was, Fiona and Sue agree, a resilience to Marjorie. \"I so regret not pinning her to the wall and saying, 'Now Marjorie, tell me everything you know,'\" says Sue. \"But there was part of Marjorie that was always secretive, that she didn't share with me, and I felt I had to respect that.\"</p> <p>For years Sue felt critical of the shadowy \"Peter White\" who was listed as her biological father but apparently showed no desire to help Marjorie or his child. In recent years she and her sisters have become more curious about what they may have inherited from their different biological fathers. \"It's interesting that we all took the decision to search for our birth mothers not our birth fathers,\" says Fiona. \"That's reflective of the mother-daughter bond.\"</p> <p>All three have now searched but only Fiona has discovered any information: before her father died he was a professional musician, and he appeared to lie to Marjorie, who declared he was married on Fiona's adoption form, when there is no record of a marriage.</p> <p>\"He was playing on the cruise ships and didn't want to be tied down. It was almost like he had a girl in every port,\" suspects Fiona, who as a dance teacher believes she inherited her musicality from him.</p> <p>Fiona thinks she got her love of clothes from Marjorie, while Hazel believes her \"positiveness and mental capacity to cope with things\" is similar to Marjorie; Sue shares Marjorie's dry sense of humour. \"We've all got good bits of Marjorie,\" says Hazel.</p> <p>For all the profound effect of their belated discovery of their biological mother, the sisters are clear that she never became their mum. Fiona likens her to an aunt; Sue calls her \"slightly more than a dear friend\".</p> <p>\"Our adoptive mums and dads are our mums and dads,\" says Hazel, \"and Marjorie was Marjorie.\"</p> <p>Parts of her life, they accept, will always remain a mystery. \"You have to learn to live with a number of unknowns, otherwise it eats away at you,\" says Sue. \"And it shouldn't because there are more important things to worry about.\"</p> <p><em>Love Child by Sue Elliott is published by Vermilion, \u00a36.99.

  "<p><strong>My early family life was crap</strong>,<strong> </strong>basically.<strong> </strong>My birth mother died when I was 18 months old. My father was married several times and I was very devoted to him, but he was a product of a broken family himself and was sent to an orphanage. I&#xa0;think he was carrying his own baggage and couldn't relate to anybody. I was farmed out for foster care at the age of about seven.</p> <p>It is the best thing that ever happened to me.</p> <p><strong>Before I was fostered,</strong> I didn't have any social stimulus. I had governesses, a private tutor and a nanny, but it didn't nourish my soul. I was the sort of child who would darkly sit in the corner and watch, which paid dividends when I&#xa0;became an actor. Eventually, I settled with a family on a farm in Devon in an environment that was absolutely a marriage of souls.</p> <p><strong>My new family immediately gave me </strong>the company of other children, and it knocked me back into shape. I get annoyed when people say, \"Oh well, they had a bad upbringing,\" or \"They had a bad background and that's why they behave like that.\" What happened to you in the past does not have to be the eternal stamp on your personality.</p> <p><strong>My relationship with my birth father</strong> continued after I was fostered. I had contact with him and a stepmother. When she died, I was an adult, by which point I had realised that perhaps my father wasn't quite the nice person my infant self had thought he was. We didn't really have anything in common so I just did my dutiful bits and made sure he was OK, but there wasn't an awful lot of heart there.</p> <p><strong>Despite lacking a consistent mother figure</strong> I don't feel emotionally incomplete, and I think that's because I ended up with the right people, but you could say I was at an age when I'd already been formulated. Like the Jesuits said, \"Give me a boy to the age of seven and I'll show you the man.\"</p> <p><strong>I have not felt tempted to explore my genealogy.</strong> I know who my mother was. I've got her birth certificate. I&#xa0;know she died of tuberculosis. It was during the war and they were short of penicillin, as it was used on the front more than anywhere else. She didn't have the medication that she should have had, but I also think probably she'd given up. From what I've heard from people, maybe she had given up with my father.</p> <p><strong>I started boarding school when I was fostered</strong> and it instilled all sorts of values. It became home to me once I got over the first week of crying. Boarding school was like a family and I loved it. I&#xa0;suddenly came into my own. I loved the discipline and structure, and by structure I mean who gives you that moral code and direction. I've always thought that I quite like the idea of the traditional family, but actually you can get those structures and that moral direction from any sort of family structure.</p> <p><strong>I'm very, very strongly in favour</strong> of giving people the opportunity of a family. Today, people wanting to enter the fostering system have to jump through a lot of hoops. There have to be legal parameters, but I still think a family that is not 100% perfect is better than a children's home. It's got to be. I didn't have to spend any time in a children's home, thank goodness. I&#xa0;agree with the discipline that a children's home would encourage and foster, but it is also instilling in a child that they are just something that can be put away. It's like kennelling a dog. Nobody is really caring.</p> <p><strong>I've never had any children</strong>. I felt when I was younger that I would be a lousy parent because of my background. But I think now I would have been a better parent. I've got an enormous number of surrogate kids, including distant family youngsters, which is lovely because that is giving me grandma status. But most of the surrogate kids I have, I'm a second mum to.</p> <p><em>\u2022 See Pam St Clement on </em><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/thismorning/\" title=\"\"><em>This Morning, weekdays, 10.30am on ITV1</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Chelsea have spent their summer in full-scale reinvention, a process undertaken at such lavish expense that there was an irony that they should endure the last few hours of the transfer window being scorched by a player they had once coveted. Radamel Falcao claimed the European Super Cup for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Londoners' expense here with a first-half hat-trick that, even in a contest Chelsea might instinctively have dismissed as meaningless, will have shaken the Champions League winners to the core.</p> <p>This was an ugly reality check, albeit one delivered with ruthless beauty, after all the giddy spending of the last few months and Chelsea's own sprightly start to the Premier League campaign. Instead it served to expose the defensive frailties that might undermine this team against opponents of real pedigree. Atl\u00e9tico, Europa League winners, are magical when they click with this one of their irrepressible displays until their concentration wavered, victory long since assured. The contest had actually been decided by the interval. Roman Abramovich had come to Monte Carlo hoping to watch his team hoist silverware again and set the tone for the months ahead. He must have departed with Falcao playing on his mind.</p> <p>Chelsea's centre-halves will be haunted by the memory of confronting the Colombian. The treble registered before the break was his second in five days, following three in the 4-0 demolition of Athletic Bilbao on Monday, to swell his tally in European competitions to 37 in 40 appearances. This is a player scouted extensively by Premier League clubs in the past, Chelsea included, when he would have been available at what now feels a knockdown price, but he is out of most clubs' financial reach these days. Falcao had scored the last goal of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas' glittering year at Porto to claim the Europa League in Dublin, and registered two more for Atl\u00e9tico in the final against Athletic Bilbao to win the trophy in Bucharest back in May. He has long since been prolific, with Chelsea just the latest opponents to be scarred.</p> <p>It was Chelsea's own sloppiness that invited catastrophe. Atl\u00e9tico had swarmed all over them from the start, their tempo blistering where Chelsea had sought to ease themselves into the contest. They simply could not cope, with this a defensive mess more reminiscent of the chaotic defeat suffered in this arena by Claudio Ranieri's side eight years ago. \"We were well below par and fell to pieces,\" said Gary Cahill. \"If we're honest with ourselves, everyone was below par. It was embarrassing at times and we let ourselves down. It was unacceptable.\"</p> <p>They were outclassed for lengthy periods, unable to suppress Atl\u00e9tico's attacking verve. The Spaniards' captain, Gabi, probed from central midfield while Arda Turan and Adrian L\u00f3pez glided menacingly. The speed at which Atl\u00e9tico counter-attacked was ferocious and their ability to drag Chelsea defenders out of position gave them space on which they capitalised ruthlessly. This was a slaughter at times. The weary prod against his own post by David Luiz in stoppage time at the end was the third occasion Atl\u00e9tico had struck the woodwork. By then Chelsea's back-line looked broken.</p> <p>Falcao, inevitably, had contributed the other two near misses, thumping against crossbar and post either side of his opening two goals. Not that this was an occasion to be critical. The sheer brilliance of the chances he did take drew the focus. There was a burst on to Gabi's slide-rule pass and an astute clip over the advancing Petr Cech seven minutes in, the shot placed cleverly to by-pass the retreating David Luiz as the Brazilian sought out the goal-line. His second was arguably more impressive, a stunned collection and deliciously curled left-footed finish from the edge of the box after coaxing rare space from Ashley Cole. The ball arced gloriously past the full-back, over Luiz and Cech's out-stretched hand. Even Chelsea's players might have considered a spontaneous round of applause.</p> <p>His reward was complete in stoppage time at the end of the period, Atl\u00e9tico breaking upfield from defending a corner with Arda Turan liberating Falcao behind Ramires. The shot scuttled through Cech's legs. Everything thereafter was a stroll. \"Ours was a slow start and, if you give Falcao space, he's dangerous,\" said Roberto Di Matteo. \"We should have blocked him before that. But we had a slow start and were never really in the game.\"</p> <p>The goals exchanged after the break felt incidental, messy scrambles as defensive discipline evaporated. Miranda's finish was delicate, Cahill's thumped in frustration at an evening far from enjoyed. Fernando Torres, who had hoped this might be his night against the club who had nurtured him, was reduced to one scuffed shot wide and a rousing chorus of his name from Atl\u00e9tico's vociferous fans, who will always appreciate one of their own. Yet, in Falcao, they have still a player impossible to forget.</p>",
  "<p>Five years, six weeks and one day after Derek Derenalagi was declared dead he stepped out into the Olympic stadium to a hero's welcome from 80,000 fans. They roared him on just as loudly as they did Hannah Cockroft, who won gold in theT34 100m in a Paralympic record of 18.06sec, and Sophia Warner, who came fourth in the T35 200m in a personal best time, and 18-year-old Rhys Jones, eighth in the T37 200m.</p> <p>Derenalagi did not even make the final of his event, the F57/58 discus. The crowd did not discriminate. His best effort was 39.37m, which is almost four metres down on his personal best. Only the top eight throwers got to take their final three throws and Derenalagi came 11th. Disappointed as he was, he will cope.</p> <p>Curious as it may seem, there are rules about how to report on these Games. Paralympics GB advises journalists that competitors should be \"portrayed as elite athletes first and foremost, rather than people who have overcome great adversity\". The understandable worry is that it would be patronising to focus on an athlete's back story. It is better, surely, to treat each as an individual. All of them have their own goals. For Cockroft nothing less than gold would do. As she said herself: \"I knew deep down that I could beat all the girls.\" She was almost a second and a half ahead of the silver medallist, Amy Siemons from the Netherlands.</p> <p>What Derenalagi has done to get here is so remarkable it deserves to be celebrated, not tiptoed around. He has said himself that his main ambition is to \"inspire others\", that he believes doing that would mean more than winning a gold medal. \"I want to put a smile on someone's face, especially someone who has lost a limb, who thinks they can't do anything. To inspire someone like that would be more rewarding to me than anything.\"</p> <p>Derenalagi, 32, lost his legs \u2013 they were amputated below the knee \u2013 while he was serving with the army in Afghanistan. His Land Rover was hit by an improvised explosive device. The medical staff had given up on him and were about to put him into a body bag when one of them detected a weak pulse. He spent eight days in a coma, three weeks in hospital. Now, with the help of the army's Battle Back rehabilitation program, he is a proud Paralympian.</p> <p>That is a common sentiment among the British track and field squad. The 21-year-old Aled Davies, who won the team's first athletics medal when he took bronze in the men's F42/44 shot put, said something similar. Eight years ago he had been watching the 2004 Athens Paralympics on TV, when he turned to his family and told them: \"One day I want to be on that podium.\"</p> <p>\"I didn't really recognise myself as disabled but I thought: 'That guy is the same as me. he has got what I got.' I remember telling everyone: 'I'll be on the podium one day \u2026 one day.'\" That day was&#xa0;Friday.</p> <p>Davies was born with hemimelia of the right leg, which means he has \"no ligaments, no tibia and no foot\". It is, he said, \"all held together with metal\". Like Derenalagi, Davies hopes he has inspired one or two people in similar situations. There may be other kids watching him on TV, dreaming of glory, just like he once did. \"It is all about inspiring a generation at the end of the day. I hope we can get a lot more people in the sport and make Paralympic sport a big thing in Britain. All these people here just gives a little taste of how many people are going to know about it.\"</p> <p>The atmosphere inside the stadium was, the Paralympians all agreed, unlike anything else. Shelly Woods, who finished third in her heat of the T54 5,000m, was the first Briton out into the stadium in the morning session. \"I've never experienced anything like it, it was immense.\" David Weir, going in the men's version of the same event, coasted through his own heat with insouciant ease, taking a tip from Usain Bolt's book and striking a pose as he crossed the line. The roar that accompanied his last lap was the loudest of the day.</p> <p>\"It was just incredible. As soon as I came out of that tunnel the whole stadium erupted,\" Davies said. \"They didn't know who I was. But I was competing for Great Britain and they just started screaming. And I thought then: 'Wow, it's here, let's go out and do it.'\" He reckoned that he had to slow down his technique and \"go at 75% of my effort because the crowd was carrying me so much, when I was going at 100% of my effort I couldn't control it. In that atmosphere and with that adrenaline my heart was going through the roof.\"</p> <p>Davies had been a swimmer, following his elder brother's lead, and had been on course to compete in Rio 2016. But he decided he wanted to compete at his home Games and went along to a talent identification day in 2005. \"Somehow I had a talent for throwing things about.\" He has deferred his third year of study at university to train full time for these Games, a decision that looks as if it will pay off. His main event is the discus, which takes place on Sunday</p>",
  "<p>Nuri Sahin has denied he joined Liverpool instead of Arsenal on loan from Real Madrid because he was offered a better financial package. The midfielder appeared ready to sign for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side before Brendan Rodgers persuaded the 23-year-old to move to Anfield, with reports suggesting Liverpool would pay him more.</p> <p>Sahin, who is in line to make his debut against Arsenal on Sunday after Liverpool paid \u00a35m to Madrid for his temporary services, said: \"Money? You don't know me very well if you think I would go for money. If it was about money I wouldn't be here. I had quite a lot of offers that would have allowed me to earn three times as much as I will earn here.</p> <p>\"I turn 24 next week and I don't care about money. I know that I will earn a lot of money in my career if everything goes well and it would be impossible in my situation and in my mind to put money above playing football. I could have gone to many places and earned much more than here. The only reason I am here is that I know that I can play football, I know that I have a manager who trusts in me and the way I play, and I am at a huge club. That is why I am here.\"</p> <p>Sahin, the 2011 Bundesliga player of the year with Borussia Dortmund, is clear that Rodgers's philosophy was the deciding factor. \"The manager told me about his thinking, about how his team is going to play football and about how he sees me fitting into the team,\" the Turkey midfielder said. \"We talked about football.\"</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the Real Madrid manager, was Rodgers's mentor at Chelsea when the Northern Irishman coached the academy, but Sahin denied Mourinho persuaded him to choose Rodgers ahead of Wenger: \"I know that they know each other but he didn't tell me to go here or go there. He told me about English football and said that I would love the Premier League because it is the best league in the world. I made my own mind up about Brendan&#xa0;Rodgers.\"</p> <p>Asked if it was difficult to turn down Arsenal and playing in the Champions League, Sahin said: \"It is a big challenge to take Liverpool back to where they belong. It will be difficult to get into the top four but we have such quality in the squad and with the new manager we can play some good games. The challenge for us will be to hold down the quality over 38 games, but we are here to go for it.\"</p> <p>Sahin had an on-field spat with Arsenal's Lukas Podolski during a Bundesliga match two years ago when the German played for K\u00f6ln, but Sahin said the prospect of Podolski becoming a team-mate was also not a factor in him choosing Liverpool. \"No. Definitely not,\" Sahin said. \"I don't have any problem with him. It happened on the field, two or three years ago, and that was it.\"</p> <p>Sahin drew comparisons with his time at Dortmund under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \"When I spoke to my family, I told them that Brendan Rodgers is a bit like J\u00fcrgen Klopp in the way he thinks about football. Dortmund and Liverpool are similar as well. The people are crazy about the clubs, the stadiums are fantastic and the way they want to play football with a high tempo and high-level passing is also similar, so that made my decision easier.</p> <p>\"In the first season when Klopp arrived we were sixth [in 2008-09], then the next we were fifth. Then we became champions and last season Dortmund were champions again. That's because of a long-term project and I think Brendan Rodgers will bring his mind about football to Liverpool. As a club, and with the supporters, there will be only one way and that is up.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Here the people will honour everything you do so it's a big challenge as a team. I'm not here to be a hero. As a team we can become heroes because I don't know how long it's been without playing in the Champions League \u2013 three seasons? To bring them back to those nights on Tuesday and Wednesday will be perfect.\"</p> <p>Last season was disrupted by injury for Sahin and he was unable to make an impact as Madrid won the Spanish title. \"I had a knee [problem] for three and a half months and after that I was fit,\" he said. \"The only problem was getting into the team because last season Real Madrid ended up getting 100 points.</p> <p>\"I have a lot of self-confidence to say that I can play if the manager trusts me. I'm&#xa0;not the kind of player who takes the ball, dribbles around four or five players and shoots on goal. I'm the player who likes to control the game, who likes to pass, to get the team on a tactically high&#xa0;level.\"</p> <p>Sahin was in Istanbul seven years ago to witness Liverpool's comeback from 3-0 down against Milan to win the Champions League. \"At half-time it was 3-0 and the people were crying. Then Dietmar Hamann comes on and the game changes.\"</p> <p>Sahin also did not rule put a permanent move from Madrid. \"Everyone will be happy if I have a difficult decision,\" he&#xa0;said.</p>",
  "<p>Our story of Vaughan George, charged at the end of his tenancy a preposterous \u00a3440 \"cleaning fee\" \u2013 which wasn't even carried out \u2013 is sadly indicative of practices that are rife across parts of the unregulated lettings industry.</p> <p>First-time tenants are particularly easy picking for the vultures. Shelter has uncovered numerous cases where tenants are charged hundreds of pounds for credit checks and inventories which only cost the agents a few pounds.</p> <p>We often receive letters from readers asking if the credit check fee (\u00a3150?), the inventory fee (\u00a380?), the insurance fee, the renewal fee, the checking-out fee, the cleaning fee, etc, etc, are legal.</p> <p>The latest wheeze has been to skim money from electricity and gas bills paid by tenants. Many are told that they can't switch to cheaper suppliers because, behind the scenes, the agent has struck a deal with a utility company that pays them commission.</p> <p>Such deals are on the fringes of legality. The other charges? As far as we can see, the law around lettings fees seems to be \"make them up as you go along and see what you can get away with\".</p> <p>But the Scottish government has come up with a simple and elegant solution to the endless disputes over dodgy fees. It has banned the lot of them.</p> <p>In future, letting agents and landlords in Scotland will only be able to charge tenants the rent (and deposit), and can no longer throw in all the other makey-uppy fees. This has, predictably, led to howls of outrage from the lettings industry.</p> <p>Landlords and agents will have \"no choice\" but to put rents up instead, they say. These are the same people who have had \"no choice\" but to put up rents over the past few years, despite the fact that the cost of servicing buy-to-let loans has fallen. Do they have \"no choice\" but to be greedy?</p> <p> \u2022 Bed bug infestation, blankets that stink of vomit, covers that get washed once a year \u2026 it's all in a fascinating discussion thread on <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ykc10/hotel_staff_of_reddit_what_is_something_that/\" title=\"\">Reddit</a>, a US social news website which asked hotel employees to reveal their secrets \u2013 and which has garnered nearly 5,600 responses.

  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of students will this month be moving into private rented accommodation for the first time. Meanwhile, millions of other people, unable to get a foot on the property ladder, also have little choice but to rent \u2013 sometimes into their 30s or even 40s.</p> <p>Disputes between letting agents, tenants and landlords are rife, so what can you do to make the whole process as stress-free as possible?</p> <h2>Fight the fees</h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Anyone can set themselves up as a letting agent, and most of us have heard horror stories about tenants suffering at the hands of dodgy or incompetent agents, and being hit with demands for exorbitant fees for spurious \"services\".</p> <p>The good news for those renting in Scotland is that last weekend the government <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/08/Tenants-Charges26082012\" title=\"\">banned letting agents and landlords from charging any tenant fees</a>. Ministers said the law would be clarified so that all charges to tenants, other than rent and a refundable deposit, \"will be deemed illegal\".</p> <p>But there is no sign of this being extended to the rest of the UK, so many will continue to be charged for things such as checking references, credit checks, providing an inventory, handing over keys, phone calls and postage. Also watch out for tenancy renewal fees and late payment fees. Earlier this year Shelter's Welsh arm <a href=\"http://www.sheltercymru.org.uk/media/press-release-display.aspx?Parentid=4&amp;year=0&amp;newsid=37\" title=\"\">said some agents were charging new tenants up to \u00a3600</a> in administration fees.</p> <p>Always get clear information about a letting agent's fees. Use one that is a member of a body or scheme such as the <a href=\"http://www.arla.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Association of Residential Lettings Agents</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nalscheme.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Approved Letting Scheme</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.naea.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Association of Estate Agents</a>.</p> <p>You will almost certainly be asked to hand over a deposit (usually a month's rent \u2013 sometimes more) and the first month's rent in advance before you move in. Don't pay a fee to register with an agency or for a list of properties - it's a criminal offence to charge for those.</p> <h2>Don't ignore the small print </h2> <p>Make sure you're clear about what kind of tenancy agreement you're signing. If all the people living in the property sign one agreement with the landlord when you move in, that's a joint tenancy. If each of you signs a separate one, you have separate tenancies.</p> <p>Check the agreement includes all the relevant information, such as what the rent covers (does it include bills?), whether you can leave before the end of the tenancy and how much notice you have to give, and any rules on things like pets, guests and smoking.</p> <p>\"If you have a joint tenancy, all the tenants have exactly the same rights. You are all equally responsible for paying the rent and keeping to the terms of your agreement,\" says <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Shelter</a>. \"If one tenant is not paying the rent or causing other problems, you could end up having to pay her/his share or any other costs. Your landlord may be entitled to keep the deposit if there is any rent owing or damage to the property at the end of the tenancy \u2013 even if it's not your fault.\"</p> <h2>Check how your deposit will be protected</h2> <p>Since 2007, private landlords and letting agents in England and Wales have had to use a government-approved tenancy deposit protection scheme to safeguard people's cash. A similar system began operating in Scotland in July, and fully takes effect on 13 November.</p> <p>Your landlord should protect your deposit in one of the schemes within 30 days of the start of your tenancy, and must give you details of which one they are using.</p> <p>In England and Wales, the three schemes are the <a href=\"http://www.depositprotection.com/\" title=\"\">Deposit Protection Service</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mydeposits.co.uk/\" title=\"\">mydeposits</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thedisputeservice.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tenancy Deposit Scheme</a>. In Scotland they are <a href=\"http://safedepositsscotland.com/\" title=\"\">SafeDeposits Scotland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mydepositsscotland.co.uk/\" title=\"\">mydeposits Scotland</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.lettingprotectionscotland.com/\" title=\"\">Letting Protection Service Scotland</a>.</p> <p>Each offers a dispute resolution service which landlords and tenants can use to sort out disagreements about deposits.</p> <h2>Help from mum and dad? <br></h2> <p>The landlord may ask students to provide a \"guarantor\" \u2013 usually mum or dad \u2013 who will cover costs if the rent isn't paid or the house is trashed. The crucial thing for parents to know is that if it's a joint tenancy, with a single agreement, any guarantor will also be jointly liable for overdue rent or damage caused by the other tenants.</p> <p>On his LettingFocus.com website, aimed at landlords, <a href=\"http://www.lettingfocus.com/pages/myarticles_Guarantorsintenancyagreements.html\" title=\"\">property expert David Lawrenson explains </a>that many parents of students may not realise this. \"It means that while they are comfortable with covering Toby or Amelia's share, they are not happy to cover Toby or Amelia's friends with the funny haircuts and the drug problem. [But] if the carpet that was ruined was in Toby's druggie housemate's room, you [the landlord] still have every right to pursue Toby's parents \u2013 even though it was not nice Toby's fault. And you may well want to do this if the chances of recovery are better from Toby's parents.\"</p> <p>Parents can try to limit their liability by writing it into their guarantor agreement.</p> <h2>Make sure the inventory is&#xa0;accurate<br></h2> <p>The inventory is a list of everything that's provided with the property , including furniture, carpets, curtains, appliances, crockery and cutlery. It should also record the condition everything is in \u2013 for example, existing damage or wear, such as an old stain on the carpet.</p> <p>Always make sure you are provided with an inventory \u2013 ask for one if necessary. If you're not given one, write one up yourself, get it signed by an independent witness and send a copy to the landlord. Shelter has a <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/23359/Inventory.pdf\" title=\"\">sample inventory form</a> on its website that people can download.</p> <h2>Remember the bills </h2> <p>Don't forget to factor in costs on top of the rent, such as utility bills, TV licence and internet access costs. Remember that full-time students are usually exempt from paying council tax.</p> <p>Watch out for any funny business with utility bills. Last month, research from comparison website <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com/\" title=\"\">uSwitch.com</a> showed that some landlords and letting agents are breaking the law by issuing contracts preventing tenants from switching energy supplier to get a cheaper deal. A rental contract can stipulate that tenants ask a landlord before switching energy supplier, but it can't refuse permission to switch.</p> <p>Some letting agents have struck deals with energy companies such as <a href=\"https://www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Utility Warehouse</a>, where the agent is paid commission if tenants use the firm's services. As a tenant, would you be happy knowing the letting agent was pocketing commission generated from your phone or electricity bills?</p> <h2>Safety, security and insurance <br></h2> <p>If you're renting a big place with several other people, check whether the landlord has, or needs, a <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/Privaterenting/Repairsandstandards/DG_189201\" title=\"\">\"house in multiple occupation\" (HMO)</a> licence for the property. Landlords of HMOs have extra legal responsibilities covering things such as fire safety. Your landlord must register their HMO with the council if it has five or more unrelated people sharing and is at least three storeys high.</p> <p>Make sure all gas appliances have been checked by a <a href=\"http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gas Safe</a>-registered engineer. Landlords have a legal duty to have all gas appliances in their properties inspected every year. And fit at least one smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector if they're not already installed.</p> <p>If you're a student, your parents may agree to include your possessions on their home contents insurance where this is allowed. Check the wording. If you aren't covered by your parents' policy and need insurance, shop around. There are student-specific policies but they can be poor value.</p> <h2>Housemate troubles<br></h2> <p>If things get really bad, can you force someone to leave? <a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Citizens Advice</a> says that if you're all joint tenants, you usually have equal rights to remain in the property and one of you can't be forced to move out.</p> <p>In a flatshare, you usually all share responsibility for the rent, it adds. If one person doesn't pay and it's a joint tenancy, you have joint liability and will have to cover their share and then try to get it back from them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if it's your name on the gas or electricity bill and the others won't pay, you will usually have to pay it and then pursue them for the money.</p> <h2>Keep good records <br></h2> <p>This could be vital if there's a dispute when you eventually come to move out. Useful items might include photos taken when you moved in (ideally, dated and labelled), receipts for any items you've replaced, correspondence about repairs and copies of bills.</p> <h2>When it's time to leave \u2026 </h2> <p>At the end of the tenancy you should get your deposit back within 10 days if you and your landlord agree the amount, says Citizens Advice. Your landlord can't keep your deposit because of \"general wear and tear\", adds Shelter. \"For example, if the carpet gets a bit worn out, it's probably wear and tear, but if you burn a hole in it, it's damage.\" It says tenancy agreements often state that things such as carpets and curtains must be cleaned to a professional standard before you go, but \"this does not mean they have to be as clean or cleaner than when you moved in\".</p>",
  "<p>America's worst drought in half a century, poor harvests in Russia and Ukraine, and Britain's washout early summer will all push up the costs of basic staple foods such as bread and pasta, while rising animal feed prices will send the price of meat soaring, experts are warning.</p> <p>Shoppers are already feeling the pinch, according to <a href=\"http://mysupermarket.co.uk/\" title=\"mySupermarket website\">mySupermarket.co.uk</a>, which compares prices at the major retailers. It said minced beef is up 19% over the past year, while peas, carrots and potatoes are up by 4%-8% \u2013 though some of this is due to seasonal factors. Overall, global food prices rose by 6% in July, according to the UN.</p> <p>America's searing summer, which has seen temperatures hit 43C (110F) day after day, has left the once-rich cornfields of the Midwest brown and shrivelled.

It is estimated that, in total, 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop has been destroyed.</p> <p>The impact on family budgets, already hit by a steep rise in train fares and near-record petrol prices, could be severe, with economists nervous it will further delay any economic recovery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395472365\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346410224144/Food-prices-table-001.jpg\" alt=\"Food prices table\" width=\"220\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food prices table Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while the crops are withering, speculators are rubbing their hands. At Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader, the head of its food trading business said this month that the US drought will be \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"Glencore food chief says US drought is 'good for business'\">good for Glencore</a>\" because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices. The Swiss and Jersey-based dealer in wheat, corn, oil and copper, made a profit of $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) in the first half of 2012.</p> <p>It's not just big traders that have jumped on the food price bandwagon. Small investors are being encouraged to use exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of individual commodities, and where minimum investments are as low as \u00a32.</p> <p>Trawl the internet and you'll find articles such as \"<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/777681-how-to-invest-for-the-global-food-crisis\" title=\"Seeking Alpha: How To Invest For The Global Food Crisis\">How to invest for the global food crisis</a>\" by Seeking Alpha, which claims it is home to \"savvy and inquisitive investors\".

We need to tell MEPs to vote to end excessive food speculation, and put the hunger of people before the greed of banks.\"</p> <p>A German lobby group, <a href=\"http://foodwatch.de/presse/pressearchiv/2012/rohstoff_fonds_umgebildet/index_ger.html\" title=\"FoodWatch website\">Foodwatch</a>, last month claimed success in its campaign against speculation after Commerzbank removed agricultural products from its ETF offering.</p> <p>\"It is reacting to the debate about a series of studies which show that investment in this type of commodity fund pushes food prices upwards and so contributes to the hunger crisis in many parts of the world,\" Foodwatch says. Last year, Deutsche Bank also said it would \"refrain from launching new staples-based exchange traded products this year.\"</p> <p>But Fidelity Investments, the biggest fund manager, says investors should be looking at agribusiness stocks, such as fertiliser companies and farm machinery makers, as the solution to the world's food challenges. In a recent research note \"<a href=\"https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/news-insights/21-century-themes/episode4.page\" title=\"Fidelity website\">Food: from crisis to crisis</a>\", Fidelity highlighted World Bank estimates that demand will rise by 50% by 2030. Much of that will be driven by population growth and a big shift in Asian diets to more meat and dairy products. This has a significant knock-on effect on grain demand as it takes 7 kilos to produce 1 kilo of meat.</p> <p>Fidelity reckons there could be a \"second green revolution\" as increased fertiliser usage improves yields in Africa and Asia. It tips fertiliser companies such as Potash Corp, Uralkali and Mosaic as potentially star stocks.</p> <p>Currently, British investors have a number of specialist agricultural funds to choose from including Allianz RCM Global Agricultural Trends, Baring Global Agriculture, Eclectica Agriculture, First State Global Agribusiness and Sarasin Agrisar.</p> <p>James Govan, manager of the \u00a3132m Baring Global Agriculture fund, says: \"The things we are investing in are about expanding food supply, such as fertilisers, drought-resistant seed, irrigation equipment and so on.\"</p> <p>Although volumes are down in America, farm incomes are up because of rising prices, which has sparked an investment boom. It's one reason why Govan is a holder of stocks such as tractor maker John Deere, whose share price has more than doubled over the past three years.</p> <p>But despite the rise in global food prices, the agricultural funds have had surprisingly weak performance. Baring's fund is up just 4.6% over the past year, Sarasin 9.7%, First State 6.2% and Allianz 3.6%. Eclectica's fund has fallen 2%. In contrast, the average fund in the UK All Companies sector is up about 16% over the past year.</p> <p>The hot money suggests there will be a fall in agricultural prices rather than a drought-inspired rise. According to ETF Securities, there has been an outflow of $622m from agricultural ETFs in the past year, much of it in recent months. Meanwhile, the ETFs which short agricultural prices \u2013 in other words, they bet on a fall in prices \u2013 are seeing inflows.</p> <p>Says Nick Brooks of <a href=\"http://www.etfsecurities.com/\" title=\"ETF Securities website\">ETF Securities</a>: \"Many investors built up positions in agricultural ETFs a year to 18 months ago, but have been selling this year. A lot of investors view agricultural prices as too high, are selling their long positions, and some are going short.\"</p>",
  "<p>It could all have been so different. \"If you had asked me 15 years ago what kind of food I would like to cook if I were to become a proper chef, I'd have said very fine, finessed, Michelin-starred.\" Happily for anyone who's ever eaten at&#xa0;one of Yotam Ottolenghi's five London places or cooked from his books (his first, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780091922344\" title=\"\">Ottolenghi</a>, is in Amazon's top 10 best-selling cookbooks ever), the&#xa0;Michelin-star plan unravelled.</p> <p>He did try it, on the pastry section at <a href=\"http://www.capitalhotel.co.uk/restaurantbar.html\" title=\"\">The Capital</a> in 1997 after abandoning a career in Israel as a journalist and academic, but \"I realised that that type of very structured cooking wasn't my style.\"</p> <p>By the time, two years later, he met fellow chef Sami Tamimi \u2013 like him, from Jerusalem, though from a Palestinian rather than Jewish background \u2013 he had discovered precisely what that style was. The pair, along with two other partners, opened <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/locations/notting-hill/\" title=\"\">the first Ottolenghi</a> in 2002, serving a joyous riff on the Levantine way of eating: exuberant, sunny flavours, simple but inventive combinations, and a sense of abundance and generosity.</p> <p>Success came immediately, and over the next decade they opened <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/locations/\" title=\"\">three more branches of the eponymous deli/cafe brand</a>, plus the slightly more glossy <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com/\" title=\"\">Nopi</a>. Along the way, Ottolenghi breakfasts have come to define a new blueprint for the ideal way to start a weekend, and Ottolenghi recipes the default option for aspirational dinner parties. It's also made Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients such as za'atar, freekeh and sumac, if not quite store-cupboard essentials, less likely to be confused by British home cooks with 1970s prog-rock albums. Still, while most enjoy the food-nerd thrill of using such obscure ingredients, they trigger indignant frustration in others. \"Readers complain when they can't get hold of something at their local supermarket,\" he says, \"but I always write with the home cook in mind, and often say what to use as a substitute. And if I didn't use more unusual ingredients, people wouldn't read me. Every era has its own list of ingredients that are considered exotic and then, 15 years later, they're not.\"</p> <p>His third book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780091943745\" title=\"\">Jerusalem</a> (number three in Amazon's food and drink chart even before its publication next week) offers a little less cause for consternation, because, says Ottolenghi, it features just one curveball ingredient: date syrup. \"It comes from Syria and Lebanon, and has a deep, fruity sweetness. It's great drizzled on roast veg or hummus-like pur\u00e9es.\" It's also likely that chard's ubiquity in the book will see it surge in popularity in the way cavolo nero did after the first <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780091812553\" title=\"\">River Cafe Cook Book</a>.</p> <p>The new book grew out of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017znj9\" title=\"\">a BBC documentary he filmed on Jerusalem's food culture</a>, and returning to the city that so shaped his own and Tamimi's approach to food was an important milestone. \"I&#xa0;last lived there over 20 years ago, so it was interesting to go back and look at it with the eyes of a chef. I realised I'd never been fully aware of the immense diversity of its food cultures.\"</p> <p>Similar programmes on Marrakech, Tunis, Istanbul and Tel Aviv are planned, but, disappointingly for his devotees outside London, Ottolenghi's future doesn't include new openings beyond the capital. \"How we run the restaurants, with one of the four of us visiting each location every day, I don't see how we could control quality in the same way from a distance.\"</p> <p>The way his recipes are so exhaustively tested doesn't lend itself to a hands-off approach, either. \"Every recipe has been microscopically analysed \u2013 does it need a hint less of that, a hint more of that?\" He laughs: \"I used to have a very unmediated experience of food but, because of the recipe testing, I've lost that now. I can't switch it off even when I'm on holiday.\"</p> <p>Nor, despite a decade of success, can he switch off the anxiety when he walks into one of his places and sees it's not hummingly busy, \"That never entirely goes away. I still have it, and I think it's right to have it if you're not to become blas\u00e9.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is sometimes said that a dying patient will cling to life while family members are present, only slipping away when everybody finally leaves the room. I&#xa0;have this, but with my house.</p> <p>All year long, the house shudders along in some kind of perpetual end stage, invariably choosing the two weeks we're on holiday to give up the ghost. This is when bits of it fall off, spring leaks or grind to a halt. Upon our return, it is not always immediately apparent which vital organ has packed up.</p> <p>\"Everything looks OK,\" I say, examining the ceiling for telltale stains.</p> <p>\"Electricity's on,\" my wife says. \"Water comes out of the taps.\"</p> <p>\"Good,\" I say. \"I'm having a bath.\"</p> <p>The bath water is cold. I check to see if the boiler is off, but it's raging away. But there is a familiar whining sound emerging from the system.</p> <p>\"The central heating is broken,\" I&#xa0;tell my wife.</p> <p>\"How can it be?\" she says. \"No one has touched it.\"</p> <p>\"This happened once before, many years ago.

I am to join them later, as soon I have completed a week's work and enjoyed a series of freezing showers.</p> <p>I arrive on Thursday night. The following morning, our host offers me a coffee. \"Sorry about the cup,\" he says. \"I had to run the dishwasher again.\"</p> <p>The youngest emerges from a bedroom. \"Dad,\" he says. \"Will you play tennis with me?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" I say, \"just as soon as I've...\" My phone dings in my pocket. It's a text from the oldest one, who is at a festival. It says: \"how do u put the tent up??\"</p> <p>This presents a puzzle. I packed him off with our bad tent, because I&#xa0;didn't trust him with our good tent, but I last erected the bad tent in 2007. I ring him.</p> <p>\"Peg out the floor,\" I say, \"then ring me back.\"</p> <p>By the time he rings, I am on the tennis court.</p> <p>\"OK,\" I say. \"There are, as I recall, two metal spacers that go on top of the poles between the inner tent and the flysheet.\"</p> <p>\"Nope,\" he says. \"There isn't anything like that in any of the... oh wait. Found them.\"</p> <p>When I return from tennis, our host offers me a beer, apologising for the glass, which is fogged and slightly greasy to the touch. I open their dishwasher and peer in. A familiar sight greets me.</p> <p>\"You're problem is simple,\" I say. \"Small bits of food have clogged the jets of both spray arms, resulting in incomplete rinsing. Pine nuts or puy lentils are usually to blame. It is a middle-class curse.\"</p> <p>An hour later we are holding sparkling wine glasses to the light.</p> <p>\"You've changed our lives,\" our host says.</p> <p>\"He's good at that sort of thing,\" my wife says with a slight stress on the <em>that</em>.</p> <p>Two days later, I'm back at home, staring at the central heating pump, having just accidentally stepped into another ice-cold bath. I try to recall the replacement plumber's name, thinking back to his last visit. Then I think: power off; drain down system; remove pump cover; extract impediment; close pump; refill system; power on.</p> <p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>",
  "<p>Sherry is one of those drinks that I&#xa0;really like but never quite find the right moment for, so it tends to sit at the back of the tipples cupboard for most for the year. That was until my new friend Jos\u00e9 F Ferre, a photojournalist turned food blogger at <a href=\"http://www.vinosdeandalucia.com/\" title=\"\">vinosdeandalucia.com</a>, charmed me into baking more often with it. Though I'd still leave the very dry, steely types for sipping, our beloved cream sherry (made by combining extra sweet with a dry type) has many uses in baking. From a simple syrup for soaking a fat baba in or spooning over fruit cakes, to using it instead of milk or water, sherry adds a gentle flavour that lends richness without being immediately detectable. The effect is subtle, so don't splash out on an expensive brand (though it's rarely <em>that</em> pricey). Rather, view this as a chance to make more from a neglected wine.</p> <h2>Sherry raisin bread</h2> <p>Good for breakfast toasted and simply buttered or slathered with marmalade. Yes, it's heaving with calories, but seeing as we're told that breakfast is the best time to eat like a king, then so be it. Once baked, I&#xa0;slice it and keep it in the freezer, then whip out a few slices and toast from frozen for those special mornings.</p> <p><strong>200ml medium sherry, such as oloroso dulce</strong><br><strong>200ml whole milk, plus a little extra for brushing</strong><br><strong>100g Seville marmalade</strong><br><strong>2 level tsp fast-action yeast</strong><br><strong>300g raisins</strong><br><strong>175g chopped almonds</strong><br><strong>500g strong white flour</strong><br><strong>100g rye flour</strong><br><strong>2 tsp fine salt</strong><br><strong>Oil and flour, for kneading and shaping</strong></p> <p>In a big bowl, stir together the sherry, milk, marmalade and yeast, add the raisins and almonds, and mix well. Add the flours and salt, work everything into a rough ball of dough, then cover the bowl and leave for 10 minutes. On a lightly oiled or floured surface, lightly knead the dough for a bare 10 seconds, return the dough to the bowl and leave for about two hours, until puffy and risen by half. Pat out the dough to about 2cm thick, then roll up tightly into a scroll and place seam-side down on a tray covered with nonstick paper. Cover with a cloth and leave for about an hour, until barely risen by half.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan-assisted)/390F/gas mark 6, brush the top of the loaf with milk, and cut a 1cm-deep slash along the centre. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is a good, rich golden-brown.</p> <h2>Sherry fruit bread pudding</h2> <p>The raisin bread also makes a good base for this pudding, which is lovely served barely warm with a little more sherry spooned over the top and some vanilla ice-cream. The combination of warm bread-and-butter pudding and cold ice-cream is embedded somewhere in my memory as one of the most comforting of all desserts.</p> <p><strong>75ml pedro ximenez or cream sherry</strong><br><strong>3 tsp vanilla extract</strong><br><strong>5 medium eggs</strong><br><strong>375ml milk</strong><br><strong>125ml double cream</strong><br><strong>Fruit bread (such as the one in the preceding recipe)</strong><br><strong>Butter</strong><br><strong>Sugar, to taste and finish (any sort)</strong></p> <p>Pour the sherry and vanilla into a bowl, crack in the eggs, beat until smooth, then stir in the milk and cream. Check it for sweetness, and add a little more sugar, if you prefer. Cut the bread into 1cm-thick slices, cut off the crusts, if you like, then butter the slices lightly. Cut the bread into fingers and lay these overlapping in the base of a large, deep one-litre ovenproof pudding dish. Only half-fill the dish (or even less, if you prefer a good custard base), pour on the egg mixture, press down the bread with a spoon so it softens, then leave to soak for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan-assisted)/350F/gas mark 4, dust a little sugar over the top and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the custard is barely set in the middle.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.danlepard.com/guardian\" title=\"\">danlepard.com/guardian</a></p>",

  "<p>I must have been about 14 when Reg Mead told me the legend of the lost iron age coins. I'd just joined the Jersey Metal Detectorists' Society to find out how to master the machine I'd been given for my birthday. Reg was the president, and his story really fired my young imagination.</p> <p>He told me the daughter of a local farmer had once said her father had disturbed an earthenware pot while removing a hedge, scattering old coins across his field. She recalled stumbling upon these funny little \"buttons\", which she'd take into school and swap for magazines. As soon as Reg heard her description \u2013 a&#xa0;\"Red Indian head\" on one side, a&#xa0;horse on the other \u2013 he was almost certain the coins were of Celtic origin.</p> <p>Reg didn't know exactly where to look, but he knew the general area. Over the years, we got permission to take our detectors into various fields and narrowed down the search. Though Reg was more than 20 years my senior, we became very good friends, spending hours in our free time sweeping the land.</p> <p>Over the next three decades, the legend of the lost hoard drew us together. There was only a narrow window between harvests during which we could search \u2013 perhaps 15 hours annually \u2013 but we never missed it. At the start of this year, we got permission to search a field we'd never tried before. We found nothing on the first day, but on the second my detector made a sound that was to become very familiar.</p> <p>I only had to dig down about three inches, and as my fingers closed around that first coin, I recognised its size and shape immediately \u2013 I'd seen others on display in Jersey museums. Finding one here gave me an electric charge of excitement. Breathless, I brushed away soil to reveal the familiar head with its distinctive curls, turned over the coin to reveal the horse on the other side. \"Reg,\" I shouted, \"you might want to come and take a look at this!\"</p> <p>He came bounding up from the bottom of the field. I opened my hand. \"This might be of interest to you?\" His face just lit up. \"So the story was true,\" he said, beaming.</p> <p>In all, we uncovered 61 coins over two days, all made of a copper and silver alloy. That's when we contacted the curator of archaeology at <a href=\"http://www.jerseyheritage.org/home\" title=\"\">Jersey Heritage</a>. An excruciating three months followed \u2013 the farmer who used the field was just about to plant a crop of Jersey Royals and we couldn't proceed until they'd been harvested. But in May, Reg and I returned to the field with his Deepseeker, a detector designed to locate objects at greater depths. Sweeping the area where we'd found the greatest concentration of coins, he hit the target almost straight away.</p> <p>Three feet down, Reg's spade struck something solid. He gently removed some of the loose soil and, when I sifted through it, five corroded copper discs spilled out.</p> <p>Yet we still weren't sure. Spurred by the legend, had we allowed our imaginations to run riot? When we returned with a team of professionals, we apologised in advance in case we were wasting their time. But the excavation soon revealed a great mass of coins, all stuck together. As&#xa0;the pit grew deeper, the estimate went from hundreds to tens of thousands. \"We're going to need a&#xa0;bigger hole,\" someone said.</p> <p>It seemed a trench had been dug by a Celtic tribe fleeing northern France in the first century BC, as Julius Caesar's legions advanced across Europe. The coins had simply been flung in and buried. It was five days before the hoard was hoisted from the clay it had occupied for more than 2000 years. It emerged like a huge teardrop, three feet across and five feet long, and was driven to the <a href=\"http://www.jerseyheritage.org/research-centre/jersey-archive\" title=\"\">Jersey Archive</a> for further study. The conservator called later to say he'd found a silver brooch among the coins and two neck torcs, possibly made of gold. Who knows what else might be hidden within?</p> <p>So far, it's the biggest hoard ever discovered on Jersey, and possibly the largest found anywhere. Some reports say it may be worth \u00a310m. I&#xa0;don't know if Reg and I will ever see any of that \u2013 the law for finders in Jersey has yet to be fully established. But I always promised my wife I'd locate real treasure one day, and my sons are fascinated by the finds. A&#xa0;reward would be a bonus, but simply adding something to the archaeology and history of Jersey would be enough \u2013 that's all Reg and&#xa0;I ever really wanted to do.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Chris Broughton.</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p><strong>I had a ticket to the Olympic Games on 6 August. I commute regularly by train and I saw posters, both on the train and at the station, advertising the nationalrailgamestravel.co.uk website, which offered \"exclusive fares for London 2012 Games ticket holders\". The implication from this was that, as a Games ticket holder, I&#xa0;would get a discounted fare down to London. </strong></p> <p><strong>On the website I found that an example fare from York to London was \u00a315 one way.

I was very disappointed to find that, had I waited, I could have got a return ticket to London for under \u00a370, considerably less than the \u00a390 I paid. As mentioned above I was led to believe that as a Games ticket holder, I would be entitled to a cheap fare to London if I booked in advance, but I now find that I have been ripped off.</strong></p> <p><strong>I wonder if other people have had a similar experience and whether this website should have been allowed to get away with this? </strong><em>LN,</em><strong> </strong><em>York</em></p> <p>We can understand why you thought you would get a cheaper train ticket. \"Exclusive fares\" does seem to suggest that \u2013 but, in fact, the fares are \"exclusive\" because they include extra flexibility that would not normally be allowed under the terms and conditions of travel.</p> <p>Train companies launched these fares for London 2012 more than a year ago for Olympic and Paralympic ticketholders. They are being sold via the website nationalrailgamestravel.co.uk, operated on behalf of train companies by Atoc, the Association of Train Operating Companies.</p> <p>The idea was that, for the fare you would normally pay for the cheapest tickets that require you to stick to a set train, you would also get a three-hour window to catch a different service if you were delayed. The delay could be because the event you were watching overran or simply because you chose to potter around the Olympic Park and get a later service, according to Atoc.</p> <p>You bought two single tickets via this website. One was from York to London on the 8.30am train on Monday 6 August and the other was a return on the 8pm train the same day. With your particular tickets, the looser terms and conditions meant you could have got any direct service from York that day if you changed your mind about your departure time and could have got any train back before 11pm.</p> <p>The galling thing with these tickets is that lots of people, like you, probably paid for flexibility they didn't really need. Anyone planning a day at the Games would be likely to have built in a few hours between an event and catching a train anyway.</p> <p>Having said that, we checked the prices of the exact same trains you took in August two months ahead and the cheapest fare we could find was a \u00a390 return. So, although you managed to find a cheaper, inflexible \u00a370 return&#xa0;fare closer to your departure date, we don't feel you have paid much over the odds.</p> <p>Atoc also says: \"On the very few occasions where tickets became available that were cheaper than the special Games fares, and where customers contacted us before their journey, we were able to offer them a refund or to book a standard fare and refund the difference, although these tickets did not offer the extra flexibility and peace of mind.\"</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p>The 150-nation biennial Olympiad reaches half-way at Istanbul this weekend and its fifth round can be viewed, live and free on the internet, starting 1pm on Saturday.</p> <p>Top-seeded Russia have a jinx to overcome. Moscow's team has failed to bring home its expected gold medals since 2002, a decade during which Ukraine and Armenia, currently the No2 and No3 seeds, each won the Olympiad&#xa0;twice. These repeated failures have led to the axing of coaches and players and put the onus on Russia's 2012 squad led by former world champion Vlad Kramnik to regain the crown which the all-conquering USSR greats of half a century ago took for granted.</p> <p>What went wrong? Some Russian grandmasters simply buckled under pressure in crucial games, but there is also a technical factor. Olympiad placings used to be settled by game points, favouring the USSR which could field legends like Paul Keres or Tigran Petrosian on its lower boards.</p> <p>Now the first decider is match points, which means that a slip and a 1.5-2.5 loss to a major rival can be very costly. Despite the huge field only a handful of countries \u2013 the top three plus China, Hungary, Azerbaijan and the US \u2013 have any realistic hopes of winning, so that a match defeat is magnified.</p> <p>England had a fine start with three wins. The team led by the UK No1 Michael Adams and the British champion Gawain Jones is seeded 11th, far below the silver medals of the 1980s yet well above most recent performances. Third board Nigel Short is also England delegate to the Fide congress, so will miss several matches.</p> <p>One Olympiad player who is guaranteed to provide entertainment for internet viewers is Judit Polgar. Hungary's all-time female No1 is the only woman in the top men's teams (the women's Olympiad is a separate event), and is a specialist at dispatching weaker opponents in style.</p> <p>Polgar's opening game in Istanbul did not disappoint. White was level for a while, but the master from Kyrgyzstan got the bad idea of attacking by 18 Qh4? 20 g4 and 24 g5? after which he was crushed by Polgar's central knights and rampant queen.</p> <p><strong>A Maznitsin v J Polgar</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> c4 Nf6 <strong>2</strong> Nf3 g6 <strong>3</strong> g3 Bg7 <strong>4</strong> Bg2 0-0 <strong>5</strong> 0-0 d6 <strong>6</strong> d4 Nc6 <strong>7</strong> Nc3 Rb8 <strong>8</strong> Re1 a6 <strong>9</strong> Rb1 b5 <strong>10</strong> cxb5 axb5 <strong>11</strong>&#xa0;b4 e6 <strong>12</strong> e4 Ne7 <strong>13</strong> Bf4 Bb7 <strong>14</strong> Qd2 Re8 <strong>15</strong> Bh6 Bh8 <strong>16</strong>&#xa0;Qf4 Qd7 <strong>17</strong> Bh3 Nh5 <strong>18</strong> Qh4? c5 <strong>19</strong> bxc5 dxc5 <strong>20</strong>&#xa0;g4 cxd4 <strong>21</strong> Nxb5 Nf6 <strong>22</strong> Nbxd4 Nxe4 <strong>23</strong> Be3 Nd5 <strong>24</strong> g5?

  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/junot-diaz\" title=\"\">Junot D\u00edaz</a> published his debut collection of linked stories, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571244973/drown\" title=\"\"><em>Drown</em></a>, in 1996, it appeared that the trajectory of his writing career had been set. Located in the barrios of New Jersey and the Dominican Republic, and filtered through the sensibility of a poor immigrant who made it to Rutgers University, the then 27-year-old's dispatches from his community \u2013 \"separated from all the other communities by a six lane highway and the dump\", as he said at the time \u2013 became a New York literary sensation. Prizes, commercial and critical acclaim, and attendant stories of large advances came accompanied by invitations to fancy parties and an assumption that D\u00edaz had embarked on a long and fruitful career.</p> <p>As things turned out he attended few of the literary parties \u2013 \"I discovered early that as an artist there was absolutely nothing wrong with being surrounded by people who were not dedicated to your field\" \u2013 and the money didn't last forever, not least because, far from becoming a fixture on the bestseller lists, D\u00edaz didn't produce another book for 12 years. \"Even I thought I would be a writer who put something out every year,\" he says now. \"But that's not how it worked out.\"</p> <p>However, despite the silence, his reputation, and, more surprisingly, his profile, remained strong. When<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571239733/the-brief-wondrous-life-of-oscar-wao\" title=\"\"><em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em></a> \u2013 a novel about a \"fat Dominican nerd, complete with Dungeons and Dragons dredged from my own nerd closet, which I'm sure my publishers wouldn't have expected after <em>Drown</em>\" \u2013 did emerge in 2008 it won the Pulitzer prize for fiction. This month he publishes his third book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571294190/this-is-how-you-lose-her\" title=\"\"><em>This Is How You Lose Her</em></a>, in which he returns to the characters and settings from <em>Drown</em>.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of background infidelity in <em>Drown</em>,\" he explains. \"And I knew I wanted to write another book of linked stories about the rise and fall of a cheater. I also wanted to return to the brother's cancer. He just disappears in <em>Drown</em>. You never get a sense of what happens to him.\" <em>This Is How You Lose Her</em> once again features Yunior, D\u00edaz's alter ego through whom he engages with the intersection of race, gender, immigration and class. Like D\u00edaz's brother, Yunior's brother contracted cancer, although D\u00edaz's brother survived. Like Yunior, D\u00edaz has a back problem \u2013 he constantly has to alternate between standing and sitting \u2013 as a result of delivering pool tables to pay his way through college.</p> <p>\"Our cancer stories are different, but what they share is a young person getting an early masterclass in mortality. I put the back problem in the very last rewrite having been working on that story for six years. It was the perfect punchline. The last piece of shit to throw on him. I furnish Yunior with a lot of my stuff so I don't have to buy anything new and while friends of mine can see small elements of me in him, I've spun him a little sharper to stand out more starkly. I don't go to his extremes of cruelty and nor do I have his Byronesque sensibilities. There is a lot of scepticism today as to whether memoir is real. But when fiction is done at a certain level there is scepticism as to whether it is really fiction.\"</p> <p>D\u00edaz, like Yunior, was born in 1968 in Santa Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. His father left to work in America shortly afterwards, and the family was eventually reunited in New Jersey when D\u00edaz, his mother and siblings \u2013 he is the third of five \u2013 emigrated in 1974. Just as D\u00edaz's stories straightforwardly accept that Yunior and some of his friends can be both ghetto kids and college kids \u2013 the narratives of street life are seamlessly punctuated by references to NYU, or to tenure or to Joyce classes \u2013 he says there was always \"a category anxiety around me\". Two of his siblings spent time in prison, while another has gone on to become a lawyer. \"I'm of African descent and my sister looks completely black, but I didn't look black. I was the super-nerdy kid who was also willing to fight. I love comics and SF but am hopeless with technology. I am still better with a pick or shovel, even with my bad back, than I am with computers.\"</p> <p>He says his remarkable use of language \u2013 his Spanglish is just one example of worlds colliding \u2013 was part of an attempt to unite the various parts of himself. \"I was from a very strict and conformist family, so it wasn't even permissible to cohere between home and the streets. Then came college and so on. In artistic terms it took a lot longer to work out than it should have. There are protocols in writing that are used to simplify things. It takes a while for an artist to work out that they can be broken. One of the contradictions of America's insane capitalism is that you will meet people like me who have lived in three or four worlds. Maybe it's to do with the fact that I'm straight and male, but I never saw any value in sealing off my background. I was critical, but I never felt one of the options was to entirely reject it. But it did take a long time for me to talk to my friends at home about the kind of books I read and the kind of politics I was interested in at college. It also took a long time for me to take my home into this larger and more intellectual world.\"</p> <p>At Rutgers in the late 80s and early 90s, both at college and in various bluecollar jobs, including in a steelworks, D\u00edaz was exposed to leftwing politics around race \u2013 South Africa and the LA riots \u2013 and gender. \"It was perfect for me. My father was a pro-dictatorship Dominican who fought on the side of the Americans during the invasion, but even as a kid I was super-left, although it was all a bit messed up and I was also homophobic as hell. I'm still politically radical, unfortunately. My students\" \u2013 he teaches at MIT \u2013 \"think it's hilarious. They find my leftwing ideas quaint and charming and want to have a picture taken next to me.\"</p> <p>While class and race politics were more visibly to the fore in <em>Drown</em>, <em>This Is How You Lose Her</em> is more obviously informed by feminist ideas. \"I grew up in a very segregated masculine world and I became fascinated by the way we represent ourselves in public. The disconnect between who we said we were and who we really were. There is nothing sadder than a 40 or 50-year-old man struggling with a mask that they have to be tough and constantly aggressive. I modelled Yunior's struggle on my earlier self in that it wasn't until my late 20s that I began to realise 'this shit doesn't work'. Over the 16 years this book took to write I always pictured this image of Yunior having this terrible metal mask that he is trying to tear off his face, all the while not sure whether he still has a face underneath it.\"</p> <p>He claims if you are a straight man, the litmus test of your humanity is your relationship with women. The omnipresent infidelity in the book follows Yunior from childhood, when he was dragged along on his father's \"pussy runs\", to his 40s, and the consequences of his own broken relationships take their toll. \"The entire culture leads us towards dehumanising women in our imaginations. I and my male friends could not have been as fucked-up in our relationships, or done the things we did in our relationships, if we felt that women were truly human. Because once you empathise that they are indeed human, you become incapable of hurting them. There is nothing that makes you think twice about fighting so much as getting your face broken. Yunior gets a romantic face-breaker and begins to understand what he has been doing throughout his adult life.\" D\u00edaz says he is unsure whether Yunior will return \u2013 \"I write so darn slowly it's difficult to say\" \u2013 but while the next book will definitely not be about him, \"I would want to write a more traditional novel about his crazy life.\"</p> <p>Since the long hiatus after <em>Drown</em>, D\u00edaz says he has become more comfortable with his pace of working. \"I put way too much pressure on myself for a while. It's easy to self-dramatise, but after <em>Drown</em> I went through so many relationships, so many apartments and so much fucking liquor. What a dick! But eventually you calm down.\" And, in hindsight, he sees value in the long wait. \"I know good things made it into <em>Oscar Wao</em> that simply wouldn't have come up if I'd been able to write it in six months. It does take time to see things properly.\"</p> <p>He says as a kid there were so many secrets in his family that he became attuned to looking beneath the surface of things. \"For instance we didn't know that one of our siblings was a half-sibling, but we did know that something was up. That was good training \u2013 to be in a family where you really had to keep your ears and eyes open. Then you go into the world and you see secrets everywhere in plain sight.\"</p> <p>His next book will be a \"monster, zombie, alien invasion story that my sister might read. Having a reader in mind is just a way of setting the bar high and hoping they give good marks. In this case my sister will be holding up the cards. She is a very smart person who doesn't like bullshit, so I'm trying to do something straightforward that is also intense and funny.\"</p> <p>As to the wider state of fiction he acknowledges a declining readership and that writers do not have the same general appeal they had 30 years ago. \"Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer would be on the Johnny Carson just talking about their new novels. Now you can only get on Jon Stewart if you talk about an issue raised in your novel. Spaces for contemplation and deliberation have been greatly reduced. Most people don't spend two or three hours thinking or reading. Books seem to be artefacts from a slower time.\"</p> <p>But as an editor on the Boston Review, encouraging fiction submissions from young writers, he declares himself hopeful. \"Books are surviving in this intense, fragmented, hyper-accelerated present, and my sense and hope is that things will slow down again and people will want more time for a contemplative life. There is no way people can keep up this pace. No one is happy. Two or three hours to read should not be an unattainable thing, although I hope we get to that stage without needing a corporate sponsored app to hold our hand. The utopian in me has my fingers crossed that we haven't quite figured out the digital future just yet. After all, the one thing we know about people: they always surprise.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/zadiesmith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith</a>'s new novel is oddly divided between confidence and indecision. The confidence is easy to understand, given an enviable alignment of talent and readership, which offers the possibility of being faithful to roots without being bound by them, ignoring the old rules about minorities and the mainstream, and politely rejecting the role of poster girl for post-ethnicity. The indecision is harder to account for. Uncertainty keeps on cracking the pavements and makes for a stumbling journey through the streets of the book.</p> <p>\"NW\" is north-west London, though the focus is tighter, largely on Willesden (south London being no more relevant than Tierra del Fugo). The main character in the first section is Leah Hanwell, a Willesdener of Irish descent now in her mid-30s, brought up on a council estate with a dodgy reputation, still living nearby though in relative comfort. Leah has a philosophy degree but works ingloriously in an office where powerlessness is dressed up in the language of empowerment. She is warmly teased \u2013 with an undercurrent of real resentment \u2013 by her female, African-Caribbean co-workers (and they're all female and African-Caribbean) for having laid hands on a treasure that rightly belongs to their community \u2013 her husband Michel, a francophone black man hoping to earn a better living from online investing than he has from hairdressing. The only flaw in the marriage is that Michel wants children and Leah does not, though she's never said so.</p> <p>There's a lovely rippling effect over the opening pages, with Leah's thoughts and surroundings enriching each other, rather in the manner of <em>Ulysses</em>. It begins to look as if Joyce will be the patron saint of this novel, as Forster watched over the previous one (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141019451/on-beauty\" title=\"\"><em>On Beauty</em></a>). It's a style that doesn't bed down, though. The short length of sections works against the sense of total immersion that suits stream-of-consciousness writing. There are still modernist moments, but they take the form of minor flourishes, such as Leah's wandering thoughts being presented on one page in the shape of a tree, and a monologue from Michel (to which she's barely listening) on the next.</p> <p>Leah may be a native Londoner, but she has her naive side, and falls for the standard hard-luck story (mother desperately ill in hospital, no money for a taxi) told to her by a distressed woman knocking at the door. She offers \u00a330, feeling some sort of rapport, particularly when it turns out that the two of them went to the same underperforming school. Michel and her mother make common cause in scolding her for gullibility, but even when she realises she has been scammed Leah's feelings for the con artist (name of Shar) remain conflicted.</p> <p>These tendrils of plot and situation could be trained across the trellis of various genres. A woman who wants everything but the baby her man has set his heart on? Chick lit but with deeper possibilities. An encounter with a stranger leading to an invisible criminal underworld very close at hand? London Gothic \u00e0 la <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ruth-rendell\" title=\"\">Ruth Rendell</a>, perhaps, but with convincing youth details. Smith doesn't develop these strands, but she doesn't risk cutting them loose altogether.</p> <p>Meanwhile the tempo slackens, as if a well fitted-out yacht were waiting for a breeze that never comes. Not all the secondary decisions are successful, but at least they get made. One of them is to present dialogue without inverted commas, as Joyce did (he hated those marks, calling them \"perverted commas\"), using a dash instead. This preference calls for extra clarity when it comes to demarcating the end of speeches. What to make of this, for instance? \"\u2013 I can see the magistrates' court and \u2026 a roundabout? Kids, stay close, stay in. It's like walking the hard shoulder on the motorway. Nightmare. Kennedy Fried Chicken. Polish Bar and Pool. Euphoria Massage. Glad we took the scenic route. This can't still be Willesden. Feels like we're in Neasden already.\" <em>Ulysses</em> taught readers to read sentence-fragments as signals that the barriers between inside and outside, speech and thought, were dissolving, but here the whole paragraph seems to be spoken aloud.</p> <p>There's an unpredictably changing distance in the point of view as it addresses Leah. The equivalent in a film would be jarring alternation between long shot, two shot and extreme close-up. There's even some wobble in matters of detail. Leah's mother thinks goods in Poundland can be priced at \u00a32.49, and a local chemist's does a brisk trade developing films. At one stage Leah puts a payment on an old credit card from her student days, to prevent Michel from finding out. That's quite a trick, with a card so long expired.</p> <p>The whole of the first section is defined by its resistance to genre, by what it doesn't want to be. It's like an oddly shaped inner-city park, bounded not only by chick-lit and thriller but by the modernism it aspires to. The touches of dilute Joycean play are less like new ways of looking at the world than mildly adventurous ways of organising a narrative. <em>NW</em> even abuts on the territory of the \"Hampstead novel\" (Hampstead being geographically close however socially and spiritually distant), that antique dismissive term for novels in which middle-class people alternately gloat and lament over their privileges. Leah's oldest friend Natalie invites her and Michel to dinner parties whose conversation is reproduced as a composite stream of banalities (\"Let me tell you about Islam\") and food fetishism (\"Pass the green beans with shaved almonds\"). There's a touch of bad faith here, since successful authors are rarely looking at dinner-party rituals from below the salt. The whole book is oddly queasy about the value of getting on in the world.</p> <p>In the next section the tone warms up. Inverted commas make a return, like birdless wings after some seasonal migration, bringing with them an immediate uplift in terms of readability. The main character here is Felix Cooper, a recovering addict putting his life back together and rejoicing in a recently established relationship. Encounters with his father and a neighbour sketch in a painful but not hopeless background. The dialogue can't avoid the pervasive non-interrogatives \"innit\" and \"is it\", but isn't ruled by them (\"to chirps\", meaning \" to chat up\", is lovely). Felix sets out from NW6 to W1 to inspect a derelict sports car owned by a posh boy named Tom, going cheap, but also pays a visit on impulse to Annie, an ex-lover of his based in Soho.</p> <p>It's perverse to represent Tom's point of view, without the necessary knowledge or sympathy, but Annie is the one privileged character in the book who isn't dead on the page, perhaps because she survives by performing her class status, in the hope that poshness will disguise poverty. The section about Felix's day is certainly the most successful in the book, though it connects weakly with the rest, as if this were a separate project, imperfectly incorporated.</p> <p>The rest of the book is devoted to Leah's friend Natalie. There's nothing limited about female friendship as a subject, as long as you have confidence in it. But the Leah panel and the Natalie panel simply don't line up \u2013 the hinges grind. The time scheme moves past the original dramatic set-up, the entanglement with Shar, as if it had never been important.</p> <p>This is the section that works hardest to achieve consistency of tone, but the chosen tone is an odd one, of brittle distance. The character is routinely referred to as \"Natalie Blake\", as if the writer was reminding herself not to get close. Numbered subsections suggest a series of propositions, about marginality, education, privilege, rather than a felt story. Sometimes subsections need a title to clarify an allusion, so that \"178. Beehive\" establishes, for the reader in need of clues, that the singer being described (\"this voice sounded like London\") is indeed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a>. Similar contortions of reference shroud perfectly ordinary mentions of <em>Friends</em> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\"><em>The Wire</em></a>. There's no sophisticated response to the world that excludes irony, but the irony here seems anxious and self-protective. It's in this section, where she works hardest at building a wall between character and reader, that Smith also feels the need to break through it with misjudged interventions along the lines of \"You're welcome\" and \"In case you were wondering \u2026\" The conflicts within the writer are deeper than the ones she has devised for her characters.</p> <p>The trailing plot threads aren't exactly tied off, more tucked back in. The real mystery of <em>NW</em> is that it falls so far short of being a successful novel, though it contains the makings of three&#xa0;or four.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Mars-Jones's <em>Cedilla</em> is published by Faber.</p>",
  "<p>\"We were not destined to survive. The fact is we were not destined at all. The war would take whatever it could get. It was patient. It didn't care about objectives, or boundaries, whether you were loved by many or not at all. While I slept that summer, the war came to me in my dreams and showed me its sole purpose: to go on, only to go on.\" The young soldier speaking these words is John Bartle, a private in the US army of occupation in Iraq. He is soon to witness a horrifying yet oddly casual shooting and will later be implicated in an act that, while it is committed for the best motive, will almost destroy both his mind and any lingering moral sense he may still possess on his discharge after two years of service on the battlefields of Nineveh province. His co-conspirator in that act is his sergeant, a brilliantly defined gung-ho nihilist named Sterling, about whom John feels the most disturbing kind of ambivalence:</p> <p>\"I hated the way he excelled in death and brutality and domination. But more than that, I hated the way he was necessary, how I needed him to jar me into action even when they were trying to kill me, how I felt like a coward until he screamed into my ear 'Shoot these hajji fucks!' I hated the way I loved him when I inched up out of the terror and returned fire, seeing him shooting too, smiling the whole time, screaming, the whole rage and hate of these few acres, alive and spreading, in and through him.\"</p> <p>Like his narrator, Kevin Powers was a soldier in Iraq for two years, serving in Mosul and Tal Afar. In a brief preface he says that <em>The Yellow Birds</em> began as \"an attempt to reckon with one question: what was it like over there?\" However, he quickly decided that he was unequal to that task, because \"war is only like itself\".</p> <p>This is a perennial problem in trying to describe those experiences that relatively few share: war, madness, extreme violence or suffering, spiritual visions \u2013 all of these are only like themselves. But the fact is that, while they cannot be fully conveyed in words, the work of bearing witness \u2013 to create what Powers calls \"the cartography of one man's consciousness\" \u2013 is essential; and while few will have expected the war in Iraq to bring forth a novel that can stand beside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099532811/all-quiet-on-the-western-front\" title=\"\"><em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em></a> or <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em>, <em>The Yellow Birds </em>does just that, for our time, as those books did for theirs.</p> <p>In the creation of his three principals, moreover, Powers has given us a highly sensitive and perceptive portrayal of men at war: the mysterious, vulnerable Murph and the brutal but enormously damaged Sterling are wonderfully delineated, and it is no accident that the central character's surname makes us think of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/hermanmelville\" title=\"\">Melville</a>'s Bartleby, another man numbed to the point where, in the end, all he can do is refuse to perform the few simple acts that would preserve him.</p> <p>No doubt it will seem rash to make such references in praise of a first novel, but they are difficult to resist after a close reading of this extraordinary work: the final vision alone, in which a young man's tortured and broken \u2013 but also transfigured \u2013 body is washed away by the slow current of the Tigris is both highly risky and beautifully accomplished, the mark of an artist of the first order. <em>The Yellow Birds</em> is a must-read book, not only because it bears witness to this particular war, but also because it ekes out some scant but vital vision of humanity from its shame and incomprehensible violence.</p> <p>\"The rest is history, they say. Bullshit, I say. It's imagination or it's nothing, and must be, because what is created in this world, or made, can be undone, unmade; the threads of a rope can be unwoven. And if that rope is needed as a guideline for a ferry to a farther shore then one must invent a way to weave it back, or there will be drownings in the streams that cross our paths. I accept now, though in truth it took some time, that <em>must</em> must be its own permission.\"</p> <p>\u2022 John Burnside's <em>Black Cat Bone</em> is published by Jonathan Cape.</p>",
  "<p>What is it about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/classics/9780140449174/anna-karenina\" title=\"\"><em>Anna Karenina</em></a> that gives it special status among the great novels? How&#xa0;is it that a sensational romantic tragedy of tsarist high society, interspersed with digressions into 19th-century Russian agricultural policy, written in a seemingly plain, straightforward style across 900 pages, still provokes both excitement and respect from readers as diverse as JM Coetzee, Jonathan Franzen and Oprah Winfrey, and lures Tom Stoppard to write the script for the latest of a dozen film adaptations? The book floats in some charmed section of the lake of literary opinion where the ripples from modernism and the ripples from Hollywood overlap without merging.</p> <p>It is more admired than learned from. <em>Anna Karenina</em> couldn't be less like a conventional modern novel. Instead of a barrage of metaphors describing things in terms of other things that they resemble, Lev Tolstoy seeks the precise word for the thing itself. Instead of the solipsistic modern mode of events being experienced from the point of view of a single character, Tolstoy slips in and out of the consciousness of dozens of characters, major and minor. At one point he tells us what a character's dog is thinking.</p> <p>Tolstoy doesn't believe in \"show, don't tell\". He likes to show and tell. The teller, the narrator of the book, is a formless, omniscient voice with no elaborate Rothian construct to justify his role. No first-person or free-indirect speech here. Even while we're in a character's head, it's the narrator who recounts the character's experiences through liberal use of such unfashionable phrases as \"she thought\", \"he felt\" and \"it seemed to him that\".</p> <p>Tolstoy creates a space for the narrator's independence \u2013 the narrator is close enough to the characters to rely on them for his existence, but free enough to pass unchallenged judgment on their actions, and to tell us things about them that they don't know about themselves. The most powerful passages are those where Tolstoy slows time down to note each thought, gesture and feeling of Anna and her lover Vronsky, with a third entity present \u2013 the narrator \u2013 not only lodged deep in the two psyches, but standing back to tell us the ways in which one is misunderstanding the other.</p> <p>Each time I reread <em>Anna Karenina</em>, picking my way past the attics and cellars and rusting machinery of Tolstoy's obsessions and prejudices, a new layer of his craft emerges, to the point where, for all my admiration of Joyce, Beckett and Kelman, I begin to question whether the novel form isn't too artisanal a medium for the surface experimentation of the modernist project ever to transcend the flexing of space and time that apparently conventional language can achieve in the hands of a master.</p> <p>I'd noticed before that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/leonikolaevichtolstoy\" title=\"\">Tolstoy</a>, whose characters spend so much time in Moscow and St Petersburg, barely describes these cities. Reading <em>Anna Karenina</em> again, I see that it's more extreme than that; urban buildings and landscapes are practically invisible, whereas the countryside is described in exquisite detail.</p> <p>To Tolstoy the city is a static, artificial place. It is as if he does not believe cities are permanent, as though he feels that if he ignores them, they'll go away. It turns out that everything Tolstoy cares about, everything he describes taking place outside the character's heads, is alive and moving, in the non-human world of dogs and horses and leaves as in the human world. No human action is too small to be recorded: Karenin's knuckle-cracking, Anna screwing up her eyes, Vronsky touching the ends of his moustache. The characters are always smiling, frowning, blushing, twitching, fidgeting, touching, kissing, bowing, sobbing, and deconstructing these signs in each other. They come to us alive with intentionality, describing themselves in movement, waltzing through the ballroom, trudging through the marsh after wildfowl, racing horses, cutting hay.</p> <p>As busily as Tolstoy's creations move through space, so plausibly they move through time. How hard it is in narrative fiction, be it novel or film, to represent the chaotic reality of the passage of time, when the way a person acts or thinks one moment doesn't necessarily have a direct connection to the way that person acts or thinks 10 minutes later, or the next day, or for the rest of their life. No other novelist I can think of takes the risks Tolstoy does with the readers' understanding of what his characters are by allowing the characters to be so true to the emotions of each particular moment, even when those emotions contradict the overall portrait. The most odious characters are never beyond momentary redemption, and the most admirable characters must endure patches of vileness.</p> <p>One harsh, simplistic, but not entirely inaccurate reading of <em>Anna Karenina</em> is as Tolstoy's justification of his life up to the moment when he wrote it, through the character of his alter ego, the chippy, idealistic landowner Levin (Levin = little Lev), whose journey to faith, family and contentment down on the farm acts as a counterpoint to Anna's path of extramarital passion and death in the Babylon of the urban beau monde. Yet Tolstoy doesn't spare Levin, the character with whom he is most in sympathy.</p> <p>When Levin is out shooting with a friend at dusk and summons the courage to ask after Kitty, the young woman he loves but who turned down his offer of marriage, he learns that she's still free and is seriously ill. At this moment of high drama and revelation, two woodcocks fly over, and he forgets about Kitty in the excitement of shooting the birds. \"Now, what was that unpleasant thing?\" he thinks afterwards. \"Oh yes, Kitty's ill.\" Back at the house he admits to himself that while he's glad she's still available, he's even more pleased that she's sick; serves her right, he thinks.</p> <p>It's not attractive for Levin to feel this schadenfreude towards the woman he wants to share his life with, or to have the overflight of a small game bird blot out all thoughts of her just when he's heard she might be dying. But Tolstoy has the confidence to relay these secret moments of unlove, certain \u2013 rightly \u2013 that by being true to his weakness in one particular instant in time he will make Levin more real and human without poisoning the instants of time to come, when Levin will show himself more like the man he wants to be.</p> <p>All Tolstoy's mastery of time, space and language come together in a single moment in the middle of the book, when Anna's estranged husband Alexei Karenin, a dry, stiff government minister, and her lover Vronsky, a handsome young cavalry officer, meet beside the bed where Anna lies gravely ill after giving birth to Vronsky's child. Grief-stricken and ashamed, Vronsky is covering his face with his hands; Anna orders her husband, who is also weeping, to pull the hands away and expose her lover's face. With that gesture, Anna effects a reversal in the status of the two men. Vronsky, who had despised Karenin because he wouldn't fight a duel, is now humiliated and dishonoured; Karenin, flooded with forgiveness for everyone, wins back Anna's respect. In that moment of time, with Anna seemingly dying, the transformation is quite real. But time shifts, and the old reality comes back. Anna gets better and hates Karenin more than ever for his forgiveness. Vronsky restores his honour by shooting himself (he misses). The arc of Anna's destruction resumes. In the novel there are no turning points, only points, and characters travelling through them.</p> <p>For a spacious novel so concerned with families there's a mysterious absence at the heart of <em>Anna Karenina</em>. The heroine has no childhood. She comes equipped with a son, a dull older husband, a brother, friends, a place in high society, but no past, no younger self. There is no description of how she came to be married. Her parents are, presumably, dead, and are never mentioned. She is fully formed, ready to fall in love with the dashing Vronsky.</p> <p>It's not just Anna. Most of the other principal characters have no forebears on the scene. Levin was, like Tolstoy, orphaned at an early age. Vronsky's mother is occasionally present but when we first encounter him Tolstoy quickly tells us: \"Vronsky never knew family life.\"</p> <p>Although children as characters are present only in the background (with one brief exception), the book is preoccupied with the parent-child relationship: with having or not having children, with choosing between paternal-maternal and romantic-sexual love, or working out what to tell children when they ask what life is for. And the novel is about children in a deeper way, one that speaks to the stretched-out generations of the rich world now, where people in their 20s, 30s and 40s expect to have parents who are still alive and constantly reassure each other that they are young \u2013 that they are, in effect, still children.</p> <p>Anna, Vronsky and Levin are in their early 30s, young in today's terms, but Tolstoy doesn't provide them with an earlier generation to backstop them, or to be remembered. They are obliged to stand independently as grown men and women. This means following an existing set of social rules, like Vronsky (\"One must pay one's gambling debts, but need not pay one's tailor; one must not tell a man a lie, but one may lie to a woman\"), or breaking rules, as Anna does, or inventing their own set of rules, as Levin tries to do. They can have children \u2013 they should, in Tolstoy's view, have children \u2013 but they cannot be children. However, among the principal characters, there is an intriguing exception: Stiva Oblonsky.</p> <p>It's the Oblonskys, not the Karenins, who are referred to in the novel's famous first line: \"All happy families are alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" And the Oblonskys, Dolly and Stiva, are unhappy because Stiva is screwing around. Like the other main characters in the book, like Tolstoy himself, the Oblonskys are aristocrats, with the trappings of the upper class \u2013 rank, servants, a town house and a place in the country. But they're in debt, and the country house is falling to pieces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395348627\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/8/29/1346235777271/Anna-Karenina-station-008.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Karenina station\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00a9 Focus Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where Dolly, a kind, pious, modest, anxious figure, the mother of five living and two dead children, belongs very much to the old Russia, Stiva Oblonsky, her husband, is recognisable as the caricature of a modern man. Stiva is an old Russian short form of the name Stepan, but I can't help thinking of him as a tanned guy called Steve in a pink open-necked shirt. Beloved by everyone for his charm, his healthy glow and his radiant smile, he's generous, gregarious, greedy, hedonistic, trivial, shallow, fond of gadgets and sex with non-threatening women, infantalised by fashion and marketing. He serves six different kinds of flavoured vodka at his parties. He reads a liberal paper not because he's a liberal but because it suits his lifestyle. He uses his connections to get a cushy, well-paid government job and is selling off his wife's properties cheaply, yet still struggles to afford the life he thinks he deserves. \"However much [Stiva] tried to be a caring father and husband,\" the narrator tells us, \"he could never remember that he had a wife and children.\"</p> <p>The clashes between the moralistic Levin and his friend Oblonsky, sometimes affectionate, sometimes angry, and Levin's linkage of modernity to Oblonsky's attitudes \u2013 that social mores are to be worked around and subordinated to pleasure, that families are base camps for off-base nooky \u2013 undermine one possible reading of <em>Anna Karenina</em>, in which Anna is a martyr in the struggle for the modern sexual freedoms that we&#xa0;take for granted, taken down by the&#xa0;hypocritical conservative elite to which she, her lover and her husband&#xa0;belong.</p> <p>That elite does exert a growing influence as the book unfolds, and it is true that the moralistic side of the establishment prevents Karenin showing Anna mercy. A case could be made that the unhappy family of the opening is the Russian aristocracy in the 1870s, trying to hold the line against excessive change after the grant of freedom to millions of human beings it had owned as slaves, the peasant serfs, in 1861. The principal characters in <em>Anna Karenina</em> are literally part of one big formerly slave-owning family. Levin marries Kitty, who's the sister of Dolly, who's the wife of Stiva, who's the brother of Anna, who's married to Karenin. Even Anna and Vronsky are distantly related; their cousins are married to each other.</p> <p>The tragic consequences of the pursuit of love for love's sake, in defiance of the rules laid down by one's peers and one's family, is an eternal story, and that story is in <em>Anna Karenina</em>, but that story is not, by itself, the book Tolstoy wrote. <em>Anna Karenina</em> is no <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> story of star-crossed teenagers unjustly destroyed by their elders' cruel laws, but a story of adults vexed by boundaries. It is the portrayal of a clash between an old world of rigid religious codes, duels, fixed gender roles and strict class division and a new world of divorce, separation, custody battles, women's self-determination and uncertain moral rules.</p> <p>It's not that Tolstoy sympathises with high society's mixture of moral outrage and gladiatorial blood lust over Anna and Vronsky's affair. While it's true he allows Anna not a moment of sexual pleasure, he had censors to contend with, and makes it clear how unsuitable a partner for Anna her husband is. As the book goes on, in step with Tolstoy's increasing religiosity and his disenchantment with the project, he does put an increasing and sometimes oppressive emphasis on women's role as mothers. But none of this means he ever loses compassion for or patience with the painful, intricate detail of Anna's dilemmas.</p> <p>Anna's love for Vronsky is a nobler affair than the infantile sexual consumerism embodied in Stiva Oblonsky, the emblem of modernity. Yet for Tolstoy the line between sexual freedom and sexual greed is not a clear one. He looks ahead to the era we live in now, where the dragon of sexual repression has been slain and sexual freedom prevails, and where, better as life is, we haven't rid ourselves of the reasons Anna throws herself under a train. A woman may still marry a man she doesn't love, still feel shame and guilt for having an affair with someone else, still hate him for forgiving her, still (more rarely, certainly) lose custody of her son, still find that people she thought were her friends side with the husband, and still find that the man for whom she left the husband, the man she loves sincerely and passionately, doesn't understand her at all.</p> <p>I'm not sure Tolstoy ever worked out&#xa0;how he actually felt about love and&#xa0;desire, or how he should feel about&#xa0;it. He was torn between compassion and moral rigour, between lust and self-denial, between loving his wife and being bored by her. His uncertainty is reflected in the dual portrayal of his wife in <em>Anna Karenina</em> \u2013 as the virtuous, somewhat frumpy Dolly, worn out by childbearing, like the woman his wife was when he was writing the book, and as the feisty, pretty teenager Kitty, like the woman his wife was when he married her. They must have seemed to contradict each other, yet each was true to her time; and Tolstoy, for all that he was a master of time, was only a slave to&#xa0;truth.</p> <p>\u2022 James Meek's novel <em>The Heart Broke In</em> is published by Canongate on 30 August.

  "<p>On the day of Trafalgar (St Ursula's day, 1805) Edward Pellew was certainly not abed in England. But he wasn't off the coast of Spain. Instead, he was commanding the Royal Navy's fleet in the Indian Ocean, and for the rest of his days he must surely have thought himself accursed he was not there, with Nelson. His career was honourable \u2013 in his time he was almost as famous as Nelson himself \u2013 but his life lacked the allure of an iconic victory or a poignant death, and today we have almost forgotten him.</p> <p>Shakespeare would have found satisfying material in the British navy of the Napoleonic wars. There were plenty of striking characters about, ashore and afloat, there was a genuinely heroic strain, and there was an undercurrent of what Churchill allegedly defined as the naval tradition \u2013 rum, sodomy and the lash. But this admirable biography of a good man who spent his entire life in the service \u2013 Pellew died (in his bed) as the first Lord Exmouth of Canonteign \u2013 reminds us that the whole vast construction of Hanoverian admiralty was riddled with rivalry, nepotism, jealousy, opportunism, squabbles over prize-money and petty backbiting.</p> <p>Pellew was a child of this naval culture. The son of a packet captain, he entered the navy when he was 13 and stayed with it all his life, dying in 1833 as a viscount and an admiral of the fleet. Although a large part of his career was pursued at sea, and although he took part in innumerable minor engagements, much of this biography is necessarily taken up with going-ons behind the scenes.</p> <p>Pellew was by no means immune to the prevailing navy ethos, but he played it for good as well as for bad. He was perpetually at odds with rival officers, and he shamelessly sought the patronage of the great in search of promotion or advancement, for himself and for his family. His style was sometimes graceless, and although he was often compared with Nelson, he lacked the charisma, spiced with fallible humanity, that was to endear his great contemporary to posterity.</p> <p>He certainly carried favouritism too far in wangling ships and promotions for two of his sons, who both became not very successful admirals in their time, but he generously pulled wires on behalf of a host of unrelated prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, too. He did not himself come from a privileged navy family, and he was especially understanding towards young officers of a similar background to his own. His ships' crews greatly admired him, for his kindness as for his ability, and if some of his fellow-officers loathed his guts, many others swore by him.</p> <p>Much of his sea-time was spent blockading enemies, usually French, in one sea or another, and this often meant ennui. Stephen Taylor skilfully guides us through the less exciting passages of Pellew's life, helped along by a minor scandal or two and many disagreements, and we are made aware always of the man's enviably happy family condition: if he enjoyed an occasional peccadillo on distant stations, he and his wife were successfully married for more than 50 years. He was magnanimous to his French opponents, always considerate to his men, and generally kind.</p> <p>Pellew fought minor battles in the Great Lakes (during the war of 1812), in the Mediterranean and in the Indian Ocean, but fortunately, from an aesthetic point of view, his two seminal actions come early and late in this book. The first is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_of_18_June_1793\" title=\"\">small sea-contest that made Pellew famous. It was fought in 1793</a>, at the very start of the French revolutionary war. He was a frigate captain on the Channel station, and after a fierce single-ship fight obliged a French frigate to surrender. It was the first British victory of the war, and it was the making of him. He was knighted, promoted and entertained by <a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/historyofthemonarchy/kingsandqueensoftheunitedkingdom/thehanoverians/georgeiii.aspx\" title=\"\">George III</a> at St James's Palace; he was presented to the prime minister, William Pitt, and he became a celebrity, the \"top gun\", as it were, of the dashing frigate captains.</p> <p>Numerous pages later, the French wars being over at last, we find Pellew, still thinking of Trafalgar perhaps, writing to a friend: \"I Have no chance now of being shot and buried in a clean hammock in the pure Element of Salt Water but must be content to be thrust into a dirty hole with the frogs.\" But the book ends, as it more or less began, with a spectacular triumph.</p> <p>Nobody describes a naval battle better than Taylor, and he makes the most of <a href=\"http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Naval_History/Vol_VI/P_399.html\" title=\"\">the assault on Algiers, in 1816</a>, which brought Pellew to final heights of fame. It was the climax of a campaign against the Barbary States, the semi-independent Muslim princedoms of North Africa, which had for years preyed on the sea-traffic of the Mediterranean, and held thousands of Christian prisoners in slavery for ransom. When Pellew sailed into the port of Algiers with a vengeful fleet of 23 sail, he was, it was believed, fulfilling not simply a British need, but a Christian duty.</p> <p>It was a terrific action, fought at close range between the warships and the massed guns of the fortified port, and the fury of the battle, the explosions, the fires, the devastation on shore, the whistle of the rockets overhead, was matched by the savagery of a tremendous summer hail-storm. Pellew's success was absolute, and provides a glittering conclusion to his story. The Dey of Algiers was forced into a submissive treaty, and several thousand prisoners, of many nationalities, were set free. It was no Trafalgar, of course, but it did make a lesser European hero of Pellew, and sent him to his grave loaded with the honours of&#xa0;Christendom.</p> <p>He has never been quite forgotten \u2013 his memory is said to live on in the character of Jack Aubrey, the fictional&#xa0;hero of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jan/08/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Patrick O'Brian's novels</a>, and it will certainly be revived by this fine book, which seems to me a&#xa0;flawless demonstration of the biographer's craft.</p> <p>\u2022 Jan Morris's <em>Contact!

Over the years this historic area has been the home of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Erykah Badu, Edie Brickell, Dennis Rodman, and T-Bone Walker. Oak Cliff&#xa0; gets slapped around a lot in the media \u2013 it was the home of Bonnie and Clyde, and Lee Harvey Oswald \u2013 but it has undergone a renaissance lately.</p> <p>Lockhart Smokehouse (400 West Davis, <a href=\"http://www.lockhartsmokehouse.com\" title=\"\">lockhartsmokehouse.com</a>) does the best barbecue in Dallas in my opinion \u2013 order from the counter and eat with your fingers. Bolsa (614 West Davis, +1 214 367 9367, <a href=\"http://bolsadallas.com\" title=\"\">bolsadallas.com</a>) does great modern American; and Eno's (407 North Bishop Avenue, <a href=\"http://enospizza.com/\" title=\"\">enospizza.com</a>), a pizza place and tavern, is also worth checking out. There are some cool vintage clothing and antique shops, such as Zola's Everyday Vintage (414 North Bishop Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.zolasvintage.com\" title=\"\">zolasvintage.com</a>) and DFW M'Antiques (424 West Davis Street), an antique store geared towards men that offers free beer.</p> <p><strong>Lakewood</strong> (<a href=\"http://lakewoodguide.net/\" title=\"\">lakewoodguide.net</a>) next to White Rock Lake, has a relaxed vibe that leaves you wondering if it's a suburb of Austin. You might also call it Dallas for People Who Hate the Big City. It has drawn hippies, hipsters, artists and families, creating a sense of community. A few favourite haunts include the Cock and Bull (1920 Abrams Parkway, <a href=\"http://www.cockandbulldallas.com/\" title=\"\">cockandbulldallas.com</a>) a pub that also serves the best burger in Dallas; Cosmo's Lounge (1212 Skillman Street, <a href=\"http://cosmosbar.com/\" title=\"\">cosmosbar.com</a>) a 1960s-style martini bar with excellent pizza; Arcade Bar (1825 Abrams Parkway), and the Lakewood Landing (5818 Liveoak, +1 214 823 2410, <a href=\"http://lakewood-landing.com/\" title=\"\">lakewood-landing.com</a>). It's also home to the historic Lakewood Theater (<a href=\"http://www.lakewoodtheater.com/\" title=\"\">lakewoodtheater.com</a>), which opened in&#xa0;1938, and features occasional burlesque shows and gigs.</p> <p>The Dallas Museum of Art (<a href=\"http://dm-art.org/\" title=\"\">dm-art.org</a>), the Nasher Sculpture garden (<a href=\"http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org/\" title=\"\">nashersculpturecenter.org</a>) and the Crow Collection of Asian Art (<a href=\"http://www.crowcollection.com/\" title=\"\">crowcollection.com</a>) stand together downtown in the <strong>Arts District </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.thedallasartsdistrict.org\" title=\"\">thedallasartsdistrict.org</a>).<strong> </strong>Both the DMA and the Nasher have late-night events once a month or so, with bands, movies, and food trucks.</p> <h2>Fun things to do<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395588771\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/8/30/1346346738438/M-Line-trolley-in-Dallas.-001.jpg\" alt=\"M-Line trolley in Dallas. \" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dallas's M-Line trolley </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The M-Line (<a href=\"http://www.mata.org/map.shtml\" title=\"\">mata.org</a>) is a system of four (mostly) air-conditioned and heated vintage <strong>trolley buses</strong> running 365 days a year around Dallas's vibrant Uptown neighbourhood. All rides are free, though there is a donations box.</p> <p>The <strong>Dallas skyline</strong> is well worth admiring. The bar of my favourite hotel, the Belmont (<a href=\"http://www.belmontdallas.com\" title=\"\">belmontdallas.com</a>, stylish rooms from $99), patios at Bryan Street Tavern (<a href=\"http://www.bryanstreettavern.com/\" title=\"\">bryanstreettavern.com</a>) and The Cedars Social (<a href=\"http://thecedarssocial.com/\" title=\"\">thecedarssocial.com</a>) are some of the locations affording great views. A scene in the second episode of Dallas was filmed here, with John Ross Ewing and Christopher Ewing. Or take a free elevator ride to the roof of the old <strong>Sears Roebuck</strong> building (<a href=\"http://www.southsideonlamar.com/The-Building/Past.aspx\" title=\"\">southsideonlamar.com</a>) which is now loft housing. It has the most amazing view: as you stand below it, the rooftop sign feels a bit like the Hollywood hill sign.&#xa0; The cast of Dallas actually stayed here for some portion of the filming of the series. </p> <p>But the best panorama of the city is from <strong>Reunion Tower</strong> (+1 214 741 5560, <a href=\"http://www.reuniontower.com/\" title=\"\">reuniontower.com</a>). The Big Ball on its top is synonymous with the Dallas skyline.

The 50th anniversary of the shooting is coming up and the conspiracy theorists are foaming at the mouth. I've heard that the X on the street that marks the spot where Kennedy was shot moves every year. How's that for a conspiracy?</p> <p>Adults can relive their childhood playing two-foot-high Jenga and 1980s video games at <strong>Barcadia</strong> (1917 North Henderson Avenue, <a href=\"http://barcadiabars.com/\" title=\"\">barcadiabars.com</a>). It has several nostalgic video games as well as early-20th-century arcade game skeeball, all for 50 cents a game.&#xa0;</p> <p>Lots of people come to Dallas expecting to see <strong>cowboys</strong> and are disappointed. But the cowboy is alive and well in Fort Worth (part of the Dallas \"metroplex\"), and nowhere more so than at the <strong>Fort Worth Stockyards </strong>(140 East Exchange Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.fortworthstockyards.org/\" title=\"\">fortworthstockyards.org</a>), a working Old West ranch which is touristy but fun. Go on a Friday or Saturday night to see the rodeo or catch a show at Billy Bob's, the country music club that bills itself as the world's largest honky tonk. Nearby at <strong>Sundance Square</strong> in downtown are hip restaurants and rooftop cocktail bars.</p> <p>If you'd rather hear some real <strong>Texas blues</strong>, head for The Goat (7248 Gaston Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatdallas.com/\" title=\"\">thegoatdallas.com</a>) and Brooklyn's (1701 South Lamar Street, <a href=\"http://www.brooklynjazzcafe.com/\" title=\"\">brooklynjazzcafe.com</a>) which have blues bands or open mic opportunities nearly every night.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p>Unless you're vegetarian, you can't visit Dallas without chowing down on some <strong>barbecue</strong>. Off the Bone (1734 South Lamar Street, +1 214 565 9551, <a href=\"http://offthebonebarbeque.com/\" title=\"\">offthebonebarbeque.com</a>) is best for ribs. Hispanic culture is huge in Texas \u2013 but Texans like to put our own spin on the classics, which is why we call it <strong>Tex-Mex</strong>. My two favourite Tex-Mex establishments are Desperados (4818 Greenville Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.desperadosrestaurant.com/index.php#\" title=\"\">desperadosrestaurant.com</a>), a family-owned joint with great fajitas, and Pepe's &amp; Mito's in Deep Ellum (2911 Elm Street, <a href=\"http://www.pepesandmitos.com/\" title=\"\">pepesandmitos.com</a>), which does chipotle wine sauce enchiladas I have had dreams about.</p> <p>Dallas is also big on street tacos, except they are not on the street. Fuel City (<a href=\"http://www.fuelcity-tacos.com/home.htm\" title=\"\">fuelcity-tacos.com</a>), Rusty Taco (<a href=\"http://www.therustytaco.com/\" title=\"\">therustytaco.com</a>), and Good 2 Go Taco (<a href=\"http://www.good2gotaco.com/\" title=\"\">good2gotaco.com</a>) are three of the best for inexpensive fajita, shrimp, and picadillo (ground beef with spices) tacos. All these places, especially Good 2 Go Taco, offer vegetarian and healthy options that are just as yummy.</p> <p>If meat is not your thing, try the healthy fare at the <strong>Dallas Farmers Market</strong> (1010 South Pearl Expressway, <a href=\"http://www.dallasfarmersmarket.org/\" title=\"\">dallasfarmersmarket.org</a>), a downtown fixture for six decades and now one of the largest public markets of its type in the country.

  "<p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has admitted that his relationship with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho remains distant as Tottenham Hotspur hope to forge coaching links with Real Madrid as part of their partnership agreement with the Spanish club.</p> <p>The deal was announced on Monday, when Luka Modric completed his \u00a330m transfer from Tottenham to Madrid and, together with commercial benefits, it will see the sharing of ideas on a technical level, with coaches from each club permitted to visit their counterparts.</p> <p>However, it did not sound as though Villas-Boas, the Tottenham manager, would jump at the opportunity. He worked under Mourinho, the Madrid coach, at Porto, Chelsea and Internazionale, but the falling-out that they suffered when Villas-Boas left Inter in 2009 to go it alone as a manager has clearly not healed.</p> <p>\"It's a club co-operation,\" Villas-Boas said, of Tottenham's partnership with Madrid. \"I was working for Jos\u00e9 for five years but we haven't spoken for quite some time.\" Villas-Boas was asked whether the club partnership would see him have any dialogue with Mourinho. \"I haven't got his number,\" he replied.</p> <p>Villas-Boas's focus was on the visit of Norwich City to White Hart Lane, despite the background noise that came with the finale to the summer transfer window. He is desperate for his first win at the club after the frustration of a defeat at Newcastle United and the home draw against West Bromwich Albion and said that he would consider the inclusion of the midfielder Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, whose \u00a315m signing from Fulham was announced on Wednesday. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 trained with his new team-mates for the first time on Thursday.</p> <p>\"Moussa didn't train properly on Monday to Wednesday, not only because of the transfer and the medicals but also because he got a knock in the game against Manchester United [last Saturday],\" Villas-Boas said. \"But he trained 100% with us so he is in contention. We are happy with Moussa's versatility in terms of where he can play.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas had a positive injury update on Scott Parker, reporting that the midfielder had returned to training after his achilles operation on 8 August. Tottenham had originally predicted that Parker would come back to training after the international fixtures in September, which conclude on Tuesday week. \"Parker is back to training now,\" Villas-Boas said. \"We are looking at maybe two weeks.\"</p>",
  "<p>As a user of several Virgin services \u2013 broadband, telephone and trains \u2013 I've grown used to the idea that Richard Branson thinks of me as a good bloke, a chum and a&#xa0;mate. Maybe he imagines we went to school together, stomped our feet to Jefferson Airplane, grew beards at the same time, made bets on who would shave first. Anyhow, he knows me well enough not to stand on ceremony, so it was no surprise when he dropped me an email the other day beginning \"Hi Ian\".</p> <p>Usually all Dickie wants me to do is buy stuff from him. This time, though, he was urging me to sign a petition, which he hoped would help to make the government \"see sense\" and reconsider its decision to award the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/virgin-trains-west-coast-mainline-firstgroup\" title=\"\">west coast mainline franchise to FirstGroup</a>. He stressed that \"a member of the public\" had started the petition and that it was \"completely independent\" of the Virgin Group; nevertheless, by signing I would be letting the government know \"how passionately we all feel about keeping the west coast mainline as a Virgin Trains franchise\".</p> <p>I clicked on the link and signed. The idea that I feel \"passionately\" about Virgin retaining its franchise is, of course, ludicrous \u2013 until a few years ago, I felt, if anything, the reverse. Like many travellers on the lines to London from the Midlands, the north-west and Scotland, I had had enough of engineering works, bus substitutions and cancelled trains. Standard-class seats in Virgin's much-vaunted Pendolinos were as cramped as a charter flight's; the lavatories' sophisticated electronics often went wrong; what on older trains had been a spacious buffet was now a cramped shop.</p> <p>You might have called these the physical disadvantages of Branson travel \u2013 a little unfairly because some of them stemmed from work on upgrading the line, which meant closures and diversions that were beyond his control. But the psychological drawbacks were almost as grave. You felt you were travelling inside a one-man brand: the Virgin logo with its dated notion of youthfulness splattered everywhere, as though we were the late Jimmy Savile's lads and lassies rather than elderly couples from Milngavie on their way to see daughters in Milton Keynes. The railway floated free of geography \u2013 no new London, Midland &amp; Scottish to match the regional titles of other franchises \u2013 and paid no respect to history. It cut journey times and enjoyed higher profit margins than those of most other train-operating companies, but that was largely due to public investment in new infrastructure.</p> <p>So what has made me and more than 100,000 others sign a petition to save it? The personal reasons will vary. My own are that a concessionary railcard plus some advanced online planning mean a first-class fare to Glasgow is nearly as cheap as going standard. The journey now takes only four hours 30 minutes, the trains mainly run to time, staff are competent and friendly. These things and the passage of time have evaporated most of my loathing for the word \"Virgin\" when I see it on the sides of the carriages.</p> <p>A more important reason, however, is fear of the new, of what may come next: a typically modern British anxiety and perfectly understandable, given Michael Gove and his schools, Andrew Lansley and the NHS, and the Major government that privatised the railways 15 years ago. Just before his death in 2010, historian (and railway enthusiast) Tony Judt said words to the effect that the duty of a public intellectual had once been to imagine a better society, while now his or her duty was to try to prevent a worse one. This is worth remembering.</p> <p>As a traveller rather than a public intellectual, I asked myself what could be worse than Virgin. The answer came back that Horizon could. Not Horizon the defunct package holiday company or the literary magazine edited by Cyril Connolly, but the name rumoured to be favoured by FirstGroup for the services it will take over from Branson. (Neither parliamentary debate nor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/28/virgin-trains-legal-challenge-franchise\" title=\"\">Branson's legal challenge</a> is likely to prevent it; Branson looks like a bad loser who had no problem with the rules until he lost the game.) But how will FirstGroup afford the \u00a35.5bn it must pay the government for its 13-year franchise, a sum Branson and others think the railway's income can never afford? Through growth in traffic, says Tim O'Toole, FirstGroup's chief executive: more seats, more trains, cheaper fares, more passengers. This is a&#xa0;good deal, he told the BBC, \"good for our passengers, good for the government, good for our shareholders\".</p> <p>I signed the petition soon after I heard O'Toole list his triple beneficiaries. Onwards and spectacularly upwards in a stagnant economy: an unlikely prospect for a transport business unless a hard-faced genius is at the helm. Similar promises were made when first GNER and then National Express won the east coast mainline by paying too much to a&#xa0;greedy Treasury. But that was in the boom times, and even then, as we know, the route had to be returned to public ownership. FirstGroup will almost certainly need to cut costs as well as raise revenue. With luck, the trains may be no worse than if Branson and his partner Stagecoach had held on to them and imposed their own cost-cutting, but it is hard to see how they can be better when the principle that governs franchising is \"best value\" for the public purse rather than the traveller.</p> <p>Impermanence is the franchise's other feature. Nothing lasts. No service can grow into \"an institution\", to form a&#xa0;familiar part of the landscape, a background to our lives. When a franchise changes hands, liveries and uniforms must change; such is the childish ego of the brand. Nothing is sacred, no matter how much it has been sentimentalised and celebrated by the public it serves. The red and black funnels of Calmac ferries, for example, which have symbolised a vital transport in the Clyde and the Hebrides since the mid-19th century, may be gone next year, along with Calmac itself, when the company's contract with the Scottish government comes up for renewal. Calmac is wholly owned by the Scottish government \u2013 services to the Western Isles are rarely a paying proposition \u2013 but EU law requires competitive tendering, so Calmac's assets, its ships and piers, have been transferred to a new company that will lease them to the successful bidder. At railway privatisation, rolling stock and train services were similarly divided.</p> <p>This is a complicated story (the clearest account can be found on news website <a href=\"http://forargyll.com/\" title=\"\">forargyll.com</a>), but the struggle against its probable outcome has already accounted for the <a href=\"http://forargyll.com/2012/08/statement-from-david-macbrayne-limited-on-position-of-archie-robertson/\" title=\"\">departure of Calmac's chief executive, Archie Robertson, whose resignation was announced this week</a>. Serco, the company that has made its fortune from outsourced government services, is a likely winner. It already runs the ships that sail to Orkney and Shetland after a successful bid last year.</p> <p>The departure of Calmac from the Clyde and the Minch would for many people be an unthinkable loss, of far more cultural and historic significance than the struggle between Branson and FirstGroup. Someone should start a petition. I know someone who recalls the words of Tony Judt, and will sign.</p>",
  "<p>Concern is mounting over the welfare of an American journalist reportedly detained in Syria.</p> <p>The US state department said on Friday it was trying to confirm whether freelancer Austin Tine is being held by pro-government forces.</p> <p>The Czech government, which represents American interests in Syria, said it believed the journalist to be alive and in custody, but had yet to confirm the information with Syrian authorities.</p> <p>Meanwhile the reporter's father called on Damascus to release his son and return him to the US.

  "<p>According to Michael Palin's diary for Saturday 9 January 1982, he rang his friend George Harrison at 9pm. After a few monosyllabic responses, Harrison said pointedly: \"You're obviously not a Dallas fan, then.\" Thirty years ago, in a country with only three TV channels, everyone except Palin seemed to be watching Dallas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/david-ed-miliband-labour-election\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband has said that it was his \"secret vice\"</a>, which alarmed his father, the Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, who worried he might be \"planning a future in Big Oil\". David Cameron, probably without generating similar parental alarm, watched Dallas while at Eton.</p> <p>In 1978, when the series started, America was a long way away. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2283244.stm\" title=\"\">Freddie Laker's transatlantic Skytrain had been offering cheap, no-frills flights since 1977</a>, but went into liquidation five years later. The Atlantic really was an ocean, culturally as well as geographically, and most Britons saw America only through their TV sets. For them Dallas must have seemed like a vision of otherness and excess, with big hair, big shoulder pads and big plotlines. To others it felt like a cultural invasion, US imperialism by other means. Nowadays, of course, our talent show franchises have ensured that the trash doesn't just travel one way.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jun/14/dallas-television-series-returns\" title=\"\">new series of Dallas</a>, beginning on 5 September after a 21-year break, returns to a very different cultural landscape. Philip Purser, the Sunday Telegraph's long-serving TV critic, wrote in his 1992 autobiography, Done Viewing, that \"the gravest disservice that Dallas did television was to create an appetite for flavours so strong and artificial that the palate was ruined for more subtle and natural tastes\". But this isn't quite what happened.</p> <p>Dallas was a world in which every villain was irredeemable, every emotion signposted, and everything happened for a reason \u2013 if only that it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvinAPPfyAQ\" title=\"\">all a dream</a>. But most of the successful dramas imported from the US since Dallas have been the opposite: multi-stranded, self-consciously clever narratives that demand more intellectual and emotional work from viewers and do not always reward them with clear resolutions. In his book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/02/highereducation.news\" title=\"\">Everything Bad Is Good for You</a>, the American cultural critic Steven Johnson argued that this kind of complex drama had developed to stand up to repetition, as shows were repeated on the multiplying number of channels and had an afterlife as DVD box sets.</p> <p>The prototype for this type of series was <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hill-street-blues\" title=\"\">Hill Street Blues</a>, a programme that began three years after Dallas. Dallas also had its clones, like Dynasty and Falcon Crest, but they all predeceased it. Now that we have become habituated to the subtle, natural-seeming flavours of The Wire and Mad Men, they may have ruined our palates for characters who say \"You don't care how many lives you destroy if you get what you want!\" and \"You bought me once, you can't do it anymore!\" to a swelling background chorus of woodwind and grand piano.</p> <p>In another sense, though, Dallas in its first incarnation may have created the conditions to be a success second time around. For it was one of the first shows British viewers watched with a squint, an awareness that it was addictive and absurd. This peculiarly British compromise was actually engineered by two expats: Terry Wogan and Clive James.</p> <p>On his Radio 2 show, Wogan treated Dallas as \"a weekly Eurovision song contest\" and mocked the way that the oil-rich Ewings could only afford a single telephone in the hall. In his Observer TV column, Clive James homed in on Dallas's strange, compelling details, from its southern pronunciations (<em>prarlm</em> for problem, <em>lernch</em> for lunch) to the way that Sue Ellen moved her mouth in different directions to convey emotion.</p> <p>This professionally flippant, slyly populist voice, accepting of kitsch and able to rework it into unintentional comedy, has become the default style not only of TV reviewers but also of viewers. We have learned to read programmes against the grain, to mine enjoyment from them that may never have been intended by their makers. And thanks to this, Ed Miliband may like to note, watching Dallas need no longer be a secret vice.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joemoransblog\" title=\"\"><em>@joemoransblog</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Back in April of this year, a six-year old African-American girl named Salecia Johnson had a temper tantrum at her school, the Creekside Elementary in Milledgeville, Georgia. By all accounts, it was a pretty intense tantrum that involved lots of screaming and crying, and apparently also involved some property damage as the child \"was observed biting the door knob of the office and jumping on the paper shredder\". So the school principal did what you do when a six year-old loses the plot: she called the police, who duly arrived, handcuffed the \"unruly juvenile\", and hauled her off to the local adult jail, where she remained in a holding cell until her parents could be reached.</p> <p>Salecia was ultimately released without charge and, this time, escaped a criminal record, but was apparently traumatized by the incident and <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/mother-says-6-year-old-daughter-traumatized-after-/nQTCk/\">told journalists afterwards</a> that \"it hurted\" being placed in handcuffs.</p> <p>This should be the paragraph where I tell you that the above is all a sick joke or a fantasy scenario of what could happen if our nation's schools, particularly schools where there are a lot of minority students, went down the crazy course of using the criminal justice system to enforce discipline or to sort out the behavioral problems of children. But sadly, the incident not only actually happened, but it is also emblematic of a growing trend that has been <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice/school-prison-pipeline-talking-points\">dubbed the \"school to prison pipeline\"</a>. Despite the overwhelming evidence that sending kids to jail has lifelong negative consequences for them, schools are choosing to do just that. And while, in the past, most children who get caught up in this trend have been a little longer out of diapers than Salecia was, the thinking now seems to be if you are going to put someone on track for a life in and out of prison, you might as well get them started young.</p> <p>The reliance on law enforcement in some school districts is so out of control and so misapplied that the federal government has had to step in. Earlier this month, the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/August/12-crt-993.html\">United States department of justice (DOJ) released a report</a> alleging the existence of a school to prison pipeline in a predominately African-American school district in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. In the report, the DOJ claims that children's constitutional rights under the fourth, fifth and 14th amendments are being violated, that they are being arrested and detained without cause and denied their due process rights. The DOJ summed up their findings as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The department's findings show that children in Lauderdale country have been routinely and repeatedly incarcerated for allegedly committing school disciplinary infractions and are punished disproportionately, without constitutionally required procedural safeguards. Children have also been arrested at school for offenses as minor as defiance. Furthermore, children on probation are routinely arrested and incarcerated for allegedly violating their probation by committing minor school infractions, such as dress code violations, which result in suspensions. The department's investigation showed that students most affected by this system are African-American children and children with disabilities.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>According to reports, these mostly black, mostly disadvantaged kids are ending up in detention centers <a href=\"http://eji.org/eji/node/658\">for crimes as varied</a> as dress code violations, truancy, profanity and disrespect. It's nothing short of sinister that minority children would be sent on a prison track for engaging in behavior that is pretty standard growing-up stuff. In the school I attended as a teenager, an all-girls, predominately white, convent school run by nuns, we engaged in \"criminal\" behavior similar to that which lands the kids in Mississippi and elsewhere in prison. Dress code violations such as wearing ankle socks instead of knee socks or t-shirts instead of the required button-up blouse were standard fare; talking back or out-of-turn and truancy were everyday occurrences; and even semi-serious infractions like smoking cigarettes or sneaking vodka into the classroom in a flask were not unheard of \u2013 though I plead the fifth on all the above. Yet, the nuns, bless them, managed to deal with all these \"crimes\" and misdemeanors without ever having to call the cops or send anyone to jail.</p> <p>And that was a lucky thing for us because all the <a href=\"http://www.justicepolicy.org/images/upload/06-11_REP_DangersOfDetention_JJ.pdf\">research comes to much the same conclusion (pdf)</a>: the worst thing you can do for a kid, especially for a troubled or already disadvantaged kid, is to get them started on a cycle of incarceration. It has a lifelong impact on their mental and physical well-being, their ability to complete an education and their future job prospects. Yet, the very people who are entrusted with the responsibility of preparing children for the best possible future are too frequently abdicating that responsibility in favor of teaching certain kids a harsh lesson.</p> <p>Sadly for those kids, and for society at large, the lesson they most often learn is that the system is out to get them.</p>",

It is a scandal that those suffering the consequences of the mismanagement that has led to the revocation of its licence to educate non-EU students will again be the students and staff rather than the culpable (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Ban on non-EU students leaves 3,000 at risk of deportation</a>, 30 August).</p> <p>The university management under vice-chancellor Malcolm Gillies seems to have wilfully ignored warnings of things going wrong. In 2010 I wrote to Professor Gillies expressing my concerns about what I saw as widespread failure of institutional processes. A new senior management team was essential if systems and procedures were to improve, but in fact little changed and things only got worse. The government needs to focus on finding a better way of running and regulating our universities, not punishing international students for the sins of administrators and regulators.<br><strong>Dr James Chiriyankandath </strong><br><em>Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Anyone concerned about the UK's reputation overseas and London's global status as the most popular destination city for foreign students will be dismayed at the damaging and disproportionate way in which the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> has handled its dispute with London Met over its sponsorship of students from outside the EU. Of course the agency is right to expect a high level of administrative competence from trusted sponsors, so the public retains confidence in the system. It would be justified in requiring any university found wanting to improve its procedures. But pulling the rug from beneath all the university's existing non-EU students has caused unnecessary distress to people who are here legitimately and who have invested a great deal of money in their education and, thus, in the UK.</p> <p>Moreover, it has undermined an institution that plays a vital role in London's, and the UK's, educational infrastructure. For example, London Met educates more students from ethnic minorities than all of the Oxbridge colleges put together and attracts thousands of bona fide overseas students, whose fees effectively subsidise indigenous students' education.</p> <p>The harm done to Britain's reputation in their countries of origin will inevitably affect future applications to all British universities. Foreign students contributed about \u00a38bn to the UK economy in 2009.

While it may be appropriate to penalise LMU by withdrawing its licence to admit new first-year students, it is entirely wrong to penalise students who have got to the later stages of their courses. If the courses are still running with UK and EU students, which I assume they will be, then why not allow the non-EU students to enrol and finish their qualifications? The benefits to the students and to the reputation of UK higher education will be immense.<br><strong>Dr Roger Lowery</strong><br><em>Bromyard, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am a former Metropolitan police border control officer and, while working on the controls over the years, have witnessed some amazing decisions in relation to the admission of bogus students. There should be two major barriers to bogus students \u2013 first, the visa and, second, UK border control when the student arrives. The issuing of UK visas has been subject to cost-cutting to the extent that virtually no visa applicants are interviewed. Everything is paper/email-based (a recent decision does allow prospective Pakistani students to be interviewed, owing to the complete shambles that exists in relation to UK visas in that country).</p> <p>Despite the rhetoric, a bogus student who re-enters the UK after, say, a holiday and who is discovered as bogus by the UKBF officer (for example, if he or she is barely literate) is still allowed into the UK to appeal, and is told to report back for interview and further enquiries. Many chief immigration officers have so little faith in the system that they instruct that the \"student\" be landed even though they are clearly bogus. Virtually no bogus students who are discovered in this way are ever removed.</p> <p>Yet genuine foreign students are often treated appallingly, especially in their dealings with the Home Office.

  "<p>With David Cameron's reshuffle imminent, Michael White, the Guardian's assistant editor and former political editor, and Tessa Jowell, who is soon to step down as shadow Olympics minister, discuss the point of reshuffles \u2013 and whether they change anything for the better. Emine Saner listens in.</p> <p><strong>Michael White:</strong> Because there's blood on the carpet, journalists love reshuffles but politicians \u2013 even prime ministers \u2013 don't like them. They don't like sacking people, they're not sure who they are promoting, a reshuffle sometimes has unforeseen consequences, and it makes everyone nervous. But it's great copy for us.</p> <p><strong>Tessa Jowell:</strong> That's right. If I look back over my 13 years in government, few reshuffles moved the government on in developing important new areas of policy.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> Your great political patron, Tony Blair, was as bad as any of them. The Tories had, I think, 11 transport ministers in 18 years; Blair had quite a lot, and Gordon Brown managed three. There have been 34 transport secretaries since the second world war. One of my gripes is they reshuffle people out of a job just when they're getting competent. John Reid had eight cabinet jobs in nine years.</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> Reshuffle speculation starts months before, so you have \"walking-dead\" ministers and their departments withdraw from them. I've heard stories of how civil servants will go slow on a policy that may be controversial but dear to the heart of a soon-to-be-sacked minister. It is a recipe for dysfunctional government. Different names appear \u2013 who's for the chop and who's for promotion \u2013 according to who is briefing the papers.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> A lot of that is notoriously inaccurate. All sorts of people are tipped for the sack by Cameron next week, but I bet most won't have done to them what the papers confidently say.</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> He probably doesn't yet know who is going to move to where. Probably the person who is in charge of the master board is Jeremy Hayward [the Cabinet secretary]. Most reshuffles damage the smooth delivery of policy. They tend to be organised much more on a tactical basis \u2013 short-term consideration rather than long-term policy effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> So-and-so is tired, or hit the booze, or we need to move X or placate Y?</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> All that. In the governments I served in, certainly for the first 10 years, the relationship between No 10 and No 11 was a major factor in shaping reshuffles \u2013 there had to be enough GBs to offset any promotion of TB people. Pretty far down the list come suitability, experience and aptitude for a job. That is one of the problems. It's rare, I suspect, that a prime minister gets everybody he wants in the places he wants them at the end of a reshuffle. People are not interviewed for the jobs. You could have a different approach, where members express an interest, and the people who are appointed have argued their qualification, interest and competence.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> In the old days you had to balance the left and right. Now you have to have women, north-south has become a sensitive subject, you have to have an ethnic minority representation. We haven't got to the point \u2013 in a Paralympic week \u2013 where you need a disability [representation], perhaps that will come. These are not subject to the kind of job application considerations you're talking about \u2013 a prime minister has to check all these factors regardless of whether the politician is suitable for the job, and often they clearly aren't.</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> I would like to see a more rational and modern way of overcoming the late-night scrabbling around.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> You were brought in by Brown after Blair left, and told you were losing your cabinet position and were going to be allowed to stay on as minister for the Olympics and minister for London. That must have been unsettling.</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> It was, and I thought very hard about accepting that offer, particularly Gordon's implausibility in saying: \"Of course you will come to the cabinet, but nobody will know you're not a full member.\" I&#xa0;was very clear a year later, when he did another reshuffle, that if I was staying in the cabinet it would be as a full member.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> Was it ever plausible, and would it have resolved matters, if Blair had moved Brown from the treasury and made him a more subordinate minister?</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> That question ignores the nature of the relationship between them, which few have ever fully understood, which was their interdependence. Despite all the Blairite voices saying, \"You should sack him or move him\", there was not a chance he was going to do that.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> We've talked about there being far too much churning of ministers. Apart from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/03/chris-huhne-reshuffle-opportunity-women\" title=\"\">resignations of David Laws, Liam Fox and Chris Huhne</a>, Cameron hasn't had a reshuffle.</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> Unless ministers are disastrously incompetent, stability is important to get things done. Cameron is to be commended for not using the short-term fix of a reshuffle to distract from the profound problems his government has. He has got to a point where it's unavoidable.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> What is that point? It is about authority, isn't it? It drains away if you're not seen to be the master of your house.</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> The last authority a prime minister has is the power of patronage. The risk to Cameron now is that once he has done his reshuffle \u2013 and this is the point about reshuffles \u2013 you create as many enemies as you make friends.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> A reshuffle can't save a government, but it can damage it. In 1962, Harold Macmillan, on what became known as the night of the long knives, sacked seven cabinet ministers including the chancellor. Macmillan was gone the following year.</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> It can't save a government but it can buy short-term benefit for a prime minister. The worst reshuffle is the one designed to catch the six o'clock news. More rationality, more planning, more transparency, and less macho bullying would lead to better government.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> You're about to step down from the shadow cabinet. If you were advising the class of 2005 or 2010, would you advise someone to take the job of undersecretary for paperclips in one of the less important departments? There's a pretty good case for saying, \"No thanks prime minister\", isn't there? You learn on the back benches, don't you?</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> In 1998 I made it clear I didn't want to go in to the cabinet. I knew I had more to learn. It goes back to my point about how reshuffles could be a more open process, not just the PM sitting on the phone with the door locked. People can say: \"I don't think I'm ready yet, I want to finish the campaign for \u2026 or become an expert in \u2026 and then yes, I'd like to.\"</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> Is it true the government drivers' pool always know who's going before the ministers know themselves?</p> <p><strong>TJ:</strong> About 2006, there were rampant rumours. My driver said: \"They say you're going to transport.\" I told him I'd had a conversation with Tony that left me clear there was not going to be a reshuffle. He walked into the drivers' room where the reshuffle sweepstake was up on a board and said: \"Tessa Jowell says there's not going to be a reshuffle.\" The board was wiped clean.</p>",
  "<p>The moment I stepped forward in the pond, I was in trouble. My foot sank and didn't stop. Throwing myself backwards, I landed on the very wet, prickle-strewn bank, and wondered what to do next. My left boot was perched ankle-deep on some slippery but compacted mud. Neither my right boot nor my knee could be seen. I had stepped into a sink hole.</p> <p>Dr Naomi Ewald, the leading specialist on New Forest ponds, and I had come to a complex of ponds by the Crockford Stream to check the status of <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/species-dictionary/species/omphiscola_glabra.html\" title=\"\"><em>Lymnaea glabra</em></a>, an elusive mud snail. This small, almost cylindrical snail tends to shun the company of other species and is often found in ponds that dry out from time to time. Sometimes it will disappear altogether for a few years. When I last checked several years ago, there were adults but little sign of young. On this visit, we found good breeding populations.</p> <p>The ponds themselves are of ancient origin. They were first formed centuries ago, when the lime-rich clay of the underlying <a href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/bourne.htm\" title=\"\">Headon Beds and Barton Clays</a> was opened up. This was mostly close enough to the surface to be accessible in the southern half of the forest but tiny outcrops are to be found elsewhere. Ancient rights of marl allowed commoners to dig clay from the score or so of designated pits for use as fertiliser to improve their generally thin, acidic soil, or to build cob cottages and barns.</p> <p>When marl extraction died out towards the end of the Victorian period, nature took over. The pits, in the main, flooded to become ponds. Some in the Crockford complex become connected after heavy rain, allowing species to move around. Others remain entirely separate. This may be why a few seem never to have snails while those on either side are home to several species.</p> <p>Fortunately, we had come to the end of our inspection when I sank. Extracting one's boot from a marl sink hole requires technique. The suction has to be broken by a process of twist and turn and gentle pulling, all the while trying not to remove leg from waterlogged boot. Eventually it came free and I could enjoy a relieved squelch back to the car to clean up and compare notes.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> It's difficult to avoid clich\u00e9 on a day like today. It's a new dawn. A new era. English cricket has turned the page. A new chapter is about to begin. <em>It's the first day of the rest of English cricket's life.</em> The eerily calm left-handed opening bat/captain is dead, long live the eerily calm left-handed opening bat/captain.</p> <p>Andrew Strauss has retired and, while Alastair Cook is not quite the undisputed England captain, he holds the two most significant belts. For richer or poorer, better or back-to-back Ashes defeats, his life will never be the same. He could really do with a win against South Africa today, or there's a danger this second half of the summer could turn into a bit of a nightmare for English cricket.</p> <p>With the exception of luck and a fast bowler who'll uncomplainingly deliver 10 overs off the reel into the wind, Maurice Mentum is a captain's best friend, and Cook could do with some. There are two more ODIs and two T20 matches after today. England have never before lost series in all three forms of the game to the same side during the same tour but, as a cursory glance at the sartorial statements of Hoxton's finest fashionistas will tell you, there is a first time for everything,</p> <p>As well as the hot cricket action and the oxygen of BANTER, let's make today an Andrew Strauss farewell OBO. Send in your favourite memories* (with links if possible) and tributes**; even a bit of criticism too if you wish. But no Strauss abuse, or I'll hunt you down like Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction.</p> <p><em>* <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5tfW9H4XOU#t=14m10s\">For whatever it's worth, this brief, proud embrace with Andy Flower is mine</a>.</em></p> <p><em>** One of our readers, Phil McBryde, described Strauss as \"a quiet hero in an age of noise and constant chatter\", which I thought was very nice.</em></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss</strong> and will bat first on a beautiful day in south London. Alastair Cook says he would have batted as well. </p> <p>The good news for England is that South Africa have replaced Ryan McLaren with that donkey Dale Steyn. England make two changes: Jade Dernbach and James Tredwell come in for Tim Bresnan and the rested Graeme Swann. Both sides have longish tails as a result of those changes.</p> <p><strong>England</strong> Cook (c), Bell, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Tredwell, Anderson, Finn, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Smith, Amla, Duminy, Elgar, de Villiers (c/wk), du Plessis, Peterson, Parnell, Steyn, M Morkel, Tsotsobe.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Stuff to do while you wait for play to start</strong></p> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/six-songs-of-me\">Define your life in six <strike> regrets </strike> songs</a>.</p> <p>2.

But sometimes, sometimes, in the shadows lurks a hero. \"When one thinks of great England captains,\" begins Gary Naylor, \"there's usually something that captures their greatness \u2013 Illingworth's cussedness in taking his team off the field in Australia; Brearley's degree in people, \"Well bowled Harold\" \u2013 but I'm struggling to think of something that captures Strauss. But maybe that's it. While Fred flung down the stumps to run out Punter at The Oval in 2009 and Swanny led The Sprinkler, Strauss was always there, doing one of the hardest things in sport \u2013 leading from the shadows, leaving the limelight to those who revel in it. Thanks for the memories.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Rankings watch</strong> If England win today, they jump from No3 to No1. If they don't, as Old Man Bacala said, <em>they don't</em>.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 2-0 (Amla 2, Smith 0)</strong> Jim E. Anderson will open the bowling to the grim reaper, also known as Hashim Amla. The third ball is far too straight and flicked firmly for a couple. Those are the only runs from a decent over.</p> <p>\"Most of the talk about Strauss recently has been focused around his captaincy,\" says Brough Cooper. \"It is nice to remember at times like this what a great batsman he was at times. After this summer of SA based humiliation cast your mind back to our tour of South Africa in 2004/05. His batting was awesome, hundred after hundred just kept coming. Breathtaking stuff and worth purchasing the Cape Crusaders DVD so you can relive it, on your own in your bedsit crying into your copy of Wisden.\" This is a great point. I watched that DVD recently with a friend, semi-drunkenly at 2am on a Sunday morning (How To Show A Girl A Good Time by Rob Smyth is available from all good bookstores), and we were both wowed by how swaggering his strokeplay was, particularly square of the wicket. He was taking outstanding bowlers like Pollock and Ntini to the cleaners. There was barely a single dot ball; it was amazing.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 6-0 (Amla 2, Smith 4)</strong> Graeme Smith gets down to business in the familar style with a couple of works to leg for two off Steven Finn. Finn knocked over the stumps twice in that over, but the umpires did not call dead ball on either occasion. Smith complains to the umpires, and now Kumar Dharmasena has told Finn he will call dead ball and/or put him over his knee should it happen again.</p> <p>\"Very proud to have had Andrew Strauss as my country's captain; the dignity of the man is so refreshing in this age of Premier League excesses,\" says Christopher Langmead. My favourite moment probably is his very first match. As someone (like so many on OBO) whose formative years were spent wondering how many Tests it would take the new batsmen in the side to score a fifty, to have someone come into the side and score a ton and then nearly do it again was just wonderful (as was the calm way <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RInzRZMuWLU\">he took being sawn off by Nasser\u2026</a>). Anyway, not that you're probably reading this Andrew, but thanks for everything - you gave me a moment in winning the Ashes in Australia that earlier in my life I genuinely thought that I might never see.\" <em>Probably</em> not?!</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 12-0 (Amla 2, Smith 8)</strong> Amla, beaten by Anderson earlier in the over, punches a glorious boundary down the ground. Anderson has the weary look of a man who has spent the last six weeks trying to punch a hole in a brick wall, and who now just wants to go to sleep for a while. Happy happy sleep.</p> <p>\"My enduring memory of Strauss was when I flew back from a month in Morocco during uni summer holidays of 2005,\" says William Hardy. \"I was getting a lift home from my mother who was at The Oval. I positioned myself at the bar in a pub around the corner and proceeded to get slowly but comprehensively drunk while watching Warne rip through us. Strauss made his 2nd 100 of the series, seemingly the calmest person in the country. Always thought those two hundreds in the series were somewhat overlooked. Plus, he looks like a pair of identical twins I know.\" The first hundred was in relatively pressure-free circumstances, as England were batting for a declaration, but the second definitely does not get the credit it deserves. It's been overshadowed by the events of the final day, chiefly Kevin Pietersen's astonishing 158. Remember how nervous the whole country was on that first morning \u2013 I don't know about you, but I slept about an hour and was in work by 6am \u2013 then remember the mid-afternoon collapse to Warne, and think how serenely Strauss went on to score a century of immense importance.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 18-0 (Amla 9, Smith 9)</strong> Smith works Finn through midwicket for four from well wide of off stump, and then there's a bead ball when Finn hits the stumps during his bowling action. Amla drags an attempted cut back onto his body later in the over. Like, <em>duh</em>, department: England could really do with an early wicket.</p> <p>\"Next Thursday I shall be walking seven miles round the Alnwick Castle estate as part of Emily's Big Walk to raise funds for the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group,\" says Chris Howell. \"I know that this is pretty feeble compared to the usual epic journeys that occasionally appear asking for support on the OBO, but the real journey here is the ongoing one being made by CCLG in changing Childhood Cancer from the death sentence it was forty years ago to curable in most (but still not enough cases) today. Or, if you have a vacancy for an Inspirational Cancer-Survivor story, my own journey from Leukaemia patient to Children's Cancer Doctor and Researcher. I'd be really grateful if you could publicise this.\" <a href=\"http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/HowellFamily\">Here's the relevant link should you wish to sponsor Chris.</a></p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 30-0 (Amla 20, Smith 9)</strong> This is an ominous start for England. Amla drives Anderson pleasantly through extra cover for four and flips another boundary behind square on the leg side two balls later. His wristwork is sensational. I suppose it's a bit strange, given the age-old conventions of teenage English boys, that we've never produced a batsman with such remarkable wrists.</p> <p>\"The thing that I loved about Andrew Strauss was the fact that no matter what crap was thrown at him, be it from fellow players, the informed media, retired 'legends' or OBO know-it-alls he still came across as a nice chap,\" says Phil Withall. \"Batted with sturdy resolve and, well let's face it, led England to the No1 position which I still don't believe actually happened. Mind you I wish I could have chucked my career away at his age. Oh hang on....\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 32-0 (Amla 21, Smith 10)</strong> Smith muscles a shortish delivery from Finn towards square leg, where Bell makes a fine goalkeeper-style save high to his left. Two from the over.</p> <p>\"My favourite Strauss memory: Strauss shows Sehwag how it's done, reaching 158 in a big run-chase against India in the group stages of the last World Cup,\" says Harry Tuttle. \" Not that it's the most fluent exhibition of strokeplay you'll ever see \u2013 he's dropped several times, misfields are ubiquitous (this being the nadir of India's laxity in the field) \u2013 but because it's an innings that sums up the \u2013 yes \u2013 the character of the man. He just keeps going, a (very posh) monstrous ape climbing a skyscraper made of cricket, awkwardly deflecting a hail of missiles along the way. It's an energetic, youthful innings from a batsman who seemed to get clunkier the longer England stayed at No1. I think it will become gradually harder to distinguish the madcap glory of this innings from memories of England's brief golden age, the time between the Ashes and the India whitewash when anything seemed possible.\"</p> <p>Dropped several times? Really? I can only remember the one drop, although mine is addled. There were some cracking straight drives in that knock as well, which, as Mike Selvey has pointed out many times, showed how he'd developed over the years. The only V he bothered with in his early years was an unspoken V to those who thought English batsmen couldn't take to Test cricket like a duck to the wet stuff.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 33-0 (Amla 21, Smith 11)</strong> I wasn't paying attention during that over. P45 please! \"Andrew Strauss always seemed to me to be a leader in the same mould as Captain Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" says Lorraine Reese. \"Calm, intelligent, authoritative without trying to be and someone you respect without even thinking about it. A great captain.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 44-0 (Amla 31, Smith 12)</strong> What a <em>glorious</em> Friday afternoon it is in London. On Sky, Sir Ian Botham reckons this pitch will turn, which is a bit of a concern as South Africa have about eight spinners. Amla dumps an easy pull over midwicket for four and then savages Finn to the extra-cover boundary. What a player! His patch is seriously purple right now. How do you get him out? I suppose catching the chances he offers would be a good start.</p> <p>\"Strauss was responsible for starting the glorious grind of the last Ashes series,\" says Jack Pitt-Brooke. \"That 110 in Brisbane \u2013 with England 221 behind from the first innings \u2013 was everything you could possibly want from an England captain. He set the tone, and Cook and Trott did the rest.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-1 (Smith b Anderson 18)</strong> What an odd stroke from Graeme Smith. Everything had been calm and controlled until then, with he and Amla bringing up an inevitable fifty partnership the ball before, when suddenly he gave Anderson the charge and tried to strong-arm him through the leg side. He missed completely and the ball pinged into the leg bail. That looked hideous, but then a lot of Smith's dismissals do. They usually occur when he has a huge score to his name.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 50-1 (Amla 31, Elgar 0)</strong> Dean Elgar has been promoted to No3.</p> <p>\"'Strauss' in German means either an ostrich or a bouquet (of flowers),\" says Mark Francome. \"I only knew about the ostrich bit and was very confused to attend my first wedding and be told 'die Braut tr\u00e4gt einen Strauss' (the bride is carrying an ostrich).\" Jealous bridesmaids can be so catty sometimes.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 55-1 (Amla 32, Elgar 4)</strong> Dernbach is on for Finn. Elgar bottom edges the second ball into the pitch and just over the stumps. The next ball is full, wide and driven square with an open face for four.</p> <p>\"It's another easy call,\" says Josh Robinson, \"but no less impressive for that: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vPuO5yrSAM\">that catch</a>. It's not just the athleticism of the fielding, but also the look of sheer<br>delight on his face afterwards.\" Strauss did humble joy very well, didn't he, and the warmth of his smile was extremely infectious.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 58-1 (Amla 34, Elgar 5)</strong> Anderson off, Bopara on. Slowly, inexorably, we move towards the dreaded middle overs. Bopara nips a good one past Elgar to end a quiet over; three from it.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 60-1 (Amla 35, Elgar 6)</strong> Amla bottom edges Dernbach's slower ball but it lands well short of Kieswetter. <br>\"Don't really want to follow the cricket today,\" says Mark Knight. \"It all seems too soon. I'm still in post-Strauss mourning. As for memories, I was lucky enough to be there in Napier in 2008 to watch his career-saving 177. It wasn't an elegant or attractive innings, but it was a really compelling, gutsy performance. Watching Strauss try to conquer himself as much as the Kiwi attack. All the talk about him being such a decent bloke slightly obscures the fact that, underneath, he is also a really tough cookie and that innings showed it. It's also noteworthy that, with the resignation of Strauss and the possibly permanent exclusion of KP, Ian Bell is now the sole remaining member of the 2005 team \u2013 and he was a little bit of a passenger that series. It really does feel like the end of an era and I can't help feeling a little melancholic about it all.\" Hang on, I thought it was the end of the 2010-11 era, not the 2004-05 era. When does an era end? Does an era have more than one ending? I'm confused now.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 62-1 (Amla 36, Elgar 7)</strong> Being promoted to No3 will give Elgar a bit of time to build an innings, which he didn't really have at No4 the other day. He's helped by the fact that, at the other end, Amla will score off most deliveries. He has 36 from 40, Elgar seven from 13.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 66-1 (Amla 39, Elgar 8)</strong> One slow bowler replaces another, with James Tredwell coming on for Jade Dernbach. Amla laps a couple to fine leg and then takes a single, which makes him 350 not out on this ground in the summer of 2012. Elgar survives an optimistic shout for LBW. It hit him outside the line and would have missed off stump anyway. </p> <p>\"Am I allowed two memories of Strauss?\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"The first is the catch off Gilchrist back in 2005. The first thing to be forgotten about most players is just how good they were in the field and Strauss was an exceptionally fine slip man. The second memory is from the winter of 2007/8. Strauss had been left out of the side to tour Sri Lanka and I came across him on a Bakerloo Line train. He was sat by himself looking exceedingly glum and I left him to wallow in his own misery. The cricket bag I was carrying may not have improved his mood, either.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 70-1 (Amla 41, Elgar 10)</strong> \"Most of my favourites have been covered already (was going to say the catch),\" says Mark Jelbert, \"but what is often overlooked is <a href=\"http://trakt.us/images/people_shows/2520-89956.jpg\">how good Strauss was in Only Fools &amp; Horses</a>.\" Emails as brilliantly naff as this always deserve to be published. There's no resemblance at all!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 73-1 (Amla 43, Elgar 11)</strong> England take the bowling Powerplay, and back comes Steven Finn. Not much happens. Three singles. This is a <em>belting</em> pitch. </p> <p>\"Been reading the respectful and heartwarming tributes to Andrew Strauss and they are bringing back some truly wonderful memories,\" says Peter Robinson. \"But can I just check, he hasn't died has he?\" No, but we're all going to one day. Hope this helps!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 73-2 (Amla b Dernbach 43)</strong> Hashim Amla has gone. I don't really know what to say. Do appropriate words exist for such an unimaginable occurrence? I just expected him to bat on and on for another hundred. He went for a big drive at a fine inswinger from Dernbach, bowled from wider on the crease, that took the inside edge and splattered the stumps. Dernbach celebrates wildly, but you can understand that in the circumstances. After scoring 354 runs at the Oval this summer, Hashim Amla has finally been dismissed. Is Amla over the hill? <em>Has he jumped the shark?</em></p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 78-2 (Elgar 11, de Villiers 5)</strong> de Villiers, who has also moved up the order, tickles some nonsense to fine leg for four. It was a bit too close to the diving Kieswetter for comfort, mind.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 84-2 (Elgar 12, de Villiers 10)</strong> Most new batsmen might want to play themselves in for a while, but this is a Powerplay and AB de Villiers is one of the more selfless batsmen in world cricket, so he goes straight after Finn with a glorious cover-driven four.</p> <p>\"I was at Trent Bridge on the day of Strauss's snaffling of Adam Gilchrist, a brilliant one-handed game-changer, and of course the same day as Ponting's run out by Gary Pratt \u2013 two indelible images in the mind of cricket lovers,\" says Graeme Edgar. \"I will raise a glass to Andrew Strauss this evening over the faltering England innings!\" For all the happiness of the last two years, nothing is ever going to top 2005, is it? If you haven't watched the boxset in a while, do it. You'll feel better than you ever thought you could feel.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 87-2 (Elgar 14, de Villiers 11)</strong> It's Dernbach bowling, it's Elgar bowling, and, yes, there are variations. Dernbach has an optimistic lone LBW appeal when Elgar is hit on the pad by a fine slower ball. It was missing off stump. </p> <p>\"Beard Liberation Front says beard tampering is suspected after Hashim Amla is out at the Oval,\" writes Keith Flett.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 91-2 (Elgar 16, de Villiers 13)</strong> Shaun Pollock has been a really good addition to Sky's commentary team, especially when talking about the mechanics and thought processes of fast bowling. He has just discussed his lack of a slower ball during his career; \"whenever I tried it I felt like my shoulder was going to pop out of its joint\". Jimmy Anderson returns in place of Finn. It's a fairly quiet spell, with Elgar (16 from 30 balls) trying to establish himself at the crease and in international cricket.</p> <p>\"My own Strauss memory,\" says Andrew Moore. \"I was batting in an indoor net at the Oval in with some friends while Strauss was doing a corporate net session next door. As the corporate net finished one of my friends stopped Strauss on his way out, congratulated him on his Ashes triumph and asked if he would bowl me a delivery. Strauss looked at our fleabitten ball, remarked 'What the eff is this?' and then bowled me an atrocious half-tracker way outside off stump. Still half petrified that he might be a demon pace bowler and half thrilled that the ball wasn't straight and my dignity and stumps were going to be spared, I took a disgusting swipe at fresh air as the ball sailed harmlessly past. Cricket was most definitely not the winner. As he left he ordered us to buy new balls, which we promptly did. To this day I wish I had executed a textbook Strauss-esque leave, but maybe this would have been disrespectful. Cheers Straussy for all the good times.\" It's a good job he's an avid OBO reader, with all these personal well wishes you are sending in.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 93-2 (Elgar 17, de Villiers 14)</strong> This is a great point from John Starbuck. \"How long before we begin describing Jade Dernbach as the mystery fast-medium?\" Mystery spin is <em>so</em> noughties. Dernbach is replaced by Bopara, who skids one under de Villiers' attempted cut stroke. England will feel relatively comfortable, with South Africa's twin peaks back in the pavilion, although de Villiers too has a devastating record in this form of the game.</p> <p>In other news, while we're talking about all things Strauss, look at <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/portrait-of-anthony-strauss-of-middlesex-ccc-at-lords-in-news-photo/1122861\">this picture</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/andrew-strauss-middlesex-c-c-c-news-photo/87265373\">this picture</a>.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 99-2 (Elgar 19, de Villiers 18)</strong> Cook is rotating his bowlers regularly. Tredwell beats de Villiers, whose response is a neat reverse lap for three. Later in the over he slaps a single not far wide of the diving Morgan at short midwicket.</p> <p>\"I think what marks 2005 out for me is that, for the first (and so far only) time in my life, cricket was actually of interest to normal people,\" says Andrew Jefford. \"Friends that knew I followed the sport actively sought me out at parties to find out what was happening and my opinions on how the series was unfolding. And then, almost immediately after the series ended, they went back to rolling their eyes as soon as I made the merest mention of the game. You can't feel the highs etc etc.\" Yep, exactly. It was English cricket's London 2012. July 21 2005 will always be the first date in the DeLorean.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 101-2 (Elgar 20, de Villiers 19)</strong> Have a look at this: <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;orderby=batting_average;spanmin1=01+Jan+2010;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting\">ODI batting averages this decade</a>. AB de Villiers has had a reasonable three years.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 114-2 (Elgar 26, de Villiers 26)</strong> Thirteen from the over. Elgar charges Tredwell's first ball, driving it a touch unconvincingly over mid-on for four. de Villiers gets another boundary off the fourth ball with a high-class chip on the run. He repeats the stroke next ball, and this time Bell runs round to cow corner to save a run.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 119-2 (Elgar 29, de Villiers 28)</strong> There's a bit of inswing for Bopara, who is milked for five singles.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 120-3 (de Villiers c Bell b Tredwell 28)</strong> Having lived by the chip, de Villiers dies by the chip. Not in the clogged-arteries sense; he's just chipped Tredwell straight to Bell, running round the boundary at cow corner. That is a vital wicket for England, who now have all three of South Africa's peaks back in the pavilion. It's good captaincy from Cook as well; some might have bottled it and taken Tredwell off after he went for 13 in the previous over.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 122-3 (Elgar 31, du Plessis 1)</strong> \"My favourite Strauss memory is a square cut,\" says George Young. \"No, I tell a lie, <em>every</em> square cut.\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-EOmEsDhe8#t=1m10s\">What, even this one</a>?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 122-4 (du Plessis b Bopara 1</strong> Faf du Plessis is bowled round his legs. He walked a long way across to a straight delivery from Bopara that swung just enough to beat the bat and peg back the leg stump. Bopara, not for the first time this year, is bowling an extremely important ODI spell.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 127-4 (Elgar 32, Duminy 4)</strong> Duminy times his first ball nicely through midwicket for three. \"I'm not as surprised at AB's average as I am at He Who Shall Not Be Named being half-way down the second page of that list, behind the likes of Rav Bop and Samit...\" says Jos Roberts. Pietersen had a really lean period in ODIs for about four years until he got those two hundreds in Pakistan earlier this year; he averaged 19 in ODIs in 2009, 18 in 2010 and 32 in 2011.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 129-4 (Elgar 33, Duminy 5)</strong> South Africa have a longish tail, with Robin Petersen and Wayne Parnell next, so one more wicket would put England right on top. Kieswetter and Tredwell think they have it when Duminy pushes defensively down the wrong line, but it turned too much and would have missed off stump. That turned a long way off middle stump. Tredwell, an underrated cricketer, is doing a good job here.</p> <p>\"Please enlighten me as to where in the field is cow corner\u2026\" says Lewis Draper. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/239756.html\">Here you go</a>.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 132-4 (Elgar 36, Duminy 5)</strong> Blah blah blah. Bopara now has figures of 8-0-26-1. This is all going pretty well for England.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 140-4 (Elgar 42, Duminy 7)</strong> Elgar swipes Tredwell just short of Anderson at long on. Eight from the over, all in ones and twos.</p> <p>\"Having my email described as brilliantly naff (15th over) is and will remain the height of my OBO career, and possibly life,\" lies Mark Jelbert. \"The picture research could have been better but I maintain in the right light (i.e. dim) there is a distinct likeness.\" Quit while you're behind, Jelbert.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 141-5 (Elgar b Dernbach 42)</strong> It'd be nice to see England give Finn a couple of overs here, as one more wicket would put them in a fantastic position. It's how Australia used Brett Lee so well over the years. There is a bowling change, but it's Dernbach rather than Finn to replace Bopara. And he gets the wicket with a beautiful slower ball! Elgar groped nervously at a legspinner that turned through the gate to hit the off stump. Bowled neck and crop.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 141-5 (Duminy 9, Parnell 0)</strong> Dernbach has plenty of flaws, but when he looks good he is bloody seductive. That was brilliant.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 143-5 (Duminy 9, Parnell 1)</strong> The new batsman Wayne Parnell is one of the few men who have batted both as an opener and No10 in ODIs. He can smack the ball but will probably take a few overs to play himself in. That means Tredwell can hurry through an over for just a couple.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 155-6 (Parnell c Kieswetter b Dernbach 13)</strong> A third wicket for Jade Dernbach, with Parnell caught behind. It ended an eventful over. First Parnell flicked a boundary through midwicket with a lazy class that was almost Goweresque. That prompted Cook to take out the slip and, with Botham-baiting inevitability, the next two balls were edged through the slips at catchable height for four. But Dernbach kept bothering the outside edge and his next ball, a good one that moved away, was thin-edged to Kieswetter.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 155-6 (Duminy 9, Peterson 0)</strong></p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 160-6 (Duminy 14, Peterson 0)</strong> Five from Tredwell's over. \"I'll back Mr Jelbert up if I may,\" says Nick Lewis. \"Marked similarities, particularly in chin structure. A hint of the Hapsburgs.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 165-6 (Duminy 16, Peterson 3)</strong> Peterson is hopelessly late on a yorker from Dernbach that just misses the off stump and then inside edges a slower ball <em>this</em> close to leg stump. This has been an outstanding performance from Dernbach.<br> \"I'm coming to London and have a ticket for the 4th ODI at Lord's \u2013 do they have Wifi?\" asks Cheri Powers. \"Will I be able to follow the OBO on my iPhone? Or will I have to content myself with actually seeing the match in person.\" I am less clue. Anyone know?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 172-6 (Duminy 21, Peterson 4)</strong> South Africa have to take their batting Powerplay at this stage. The camera cuts to Peter Reid in the crowd. \"Look out London, we're meeting up tonight,\" says Sir Ian Botham. Volvic chasers and Evian toddies all round. Finn, brought back for the Powerplay, errs onto the pads and is worked to the fine-leg boundary by Duminy.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 177-6 (Duminy 24, Peterson 6)</strong> England are on top at the moment, but if South Africa will feel that anything around 240 is competitive. Much rests on Duminy, who is keeping his powder dry for now, even though we are in the Powerplay. His plan will be to get a single off almost every ball and then tee off at the death. Dernbach's eighth over is milked for five singles. In an unrelated development, <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a402717/lords-cricket-ground-to-offer-free-wireless-internet.html\">it seems Lord's does have free Wifi</a>.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 179-6 (Duminy 25, Peterson 7)</strong> A good over from the returning Anderson costs just a couple.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 183-6 (Duminy 27, Peterson 9)</strong> Duminy, whipping to leg, leading edges Finn through the covers for a single, one of four from the over. \"Lord's does indeed have free wi-fi via The Cloudl,\" says Keith Flett. \"Unfortunately the bandwidth [capacity] is really only useful for pigeons to use &amp; a full capacity crowd will mean using GPRS [which works fine in St John's Wood].\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 187-6 (Duminy 29, Peterson 11)</strong> South Africa are dealing exclusively in low-risk singles, even though we are still in the Powerplay. That's inevitable with six wickets down, and they are doing it pretty well. Anderson's eighth over costs four.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 192-6 (Duminy 33, Peterson 12)</strong> The new bowler Bopara has a couple of ludicrous LBW shouts against Duminy turned down. After just one run from the first five balls, Duminy crashes an excellent back cut for four. South Africa are inching stealthily towards a decent total.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 195-7 (Duminy c Bell b Tredwell 33)</strong> Tredwell returns to the attack, and Duminy's peepers alight fatally. He charges Tredwell and slices a miserable drive straight to Ian Bell, who takes the catch running in from long-off. Or was it back from mid-off? Whatever, he's out.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 196-7 (Peterson 16, Steyn 0)</strong> \"So, Ravi's proving his worth to this side by bowling what looks like it's going to be a full stint of 10 overs before coming in at first drop,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Meanwhile, it looks like Samit's going to be a specialist No8: is he really better at that role than Luke Wright?\" Specialist No<em>7</em>. And <em>second</em> drop. But apart from that you're <em>golden</em>!</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>43th over: South Africa 196-7 (Peterson 16, Steyn 0)</strong> <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/10582.html?class=2;orderby=overs;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings\">For only the second time in 81 ODIs</a>, Ravi Bopara completes his stint of 10 overs \u2013 and he does so with a maiden to Peterson. Outstanding stuff. Bopara ends with figures of 10-1-31-1. If he gets some runs he could almost be an allrounder, etc and so honk.</p> <p>\"Tidying my office whilst following the OBO, I came across the receipt for the cheese grater that I bought my wife as an anniversary present a couple of years ago,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"You might want to include that tip in your next dating book.\" Who needs mixtapes? Mind you, in this post-Bobbitt age, isn't buying your wife a cheese grater a bit dangerous?</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 198-7 (Peterson 17, Steyn 1)</strong> Bopara is becoming a really useful sixth bowler in ODIs. Nobody who has played in five matches this year has a better economy rate, not even the remarkable Sunil Narine, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=economy_rate;qualmin1=5;qualval1=matches;spanmax1=31+Dec+2012;spanmin1=01+Jan+2012;spanval1=span;template=results;type=bowling\">who is second on the list</a>. England's offspinner, James Tredwell, is going to bowl his last over. A reverse slog-sweep from Peterson only yields a single, one of just two from the over. Good stuff from Tredwell, who ends with decent figures of 10-0-49-2.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 203-8 (Steyn b Anderson 1)</strong> Jimmy Anderson gets medieval on Dale Steyn's off stump with a superb delivery. It angled in towards off stump and then held its line to send that off stump flying. I think Steyn was beaten for pace as much as movement. Either way, it was a belter.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 204-8 (Peterson 22, M Morkel 1)</strong> \"The Incredible Pedant wakes to say that that's twice you've had batsmen hitting 'straight to' a fielder who was 'running in (or out)' or, worse, 'running round the boundary' (over 26),\" says Luke Williams. \"And cow corner/long off aren't really straight in cricket terms, so that's no excuse. Always alert, the Pedant sleeps with one eye open\u2026.\" Not if I take that eye out, Williams, not if I take that eye out.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 211-8 (Peterson 23, M Morkel 7)</strong> Crikey. Morne Morkel flicks Jade Dernbach's first ball confidently over midwicket for four. Three additional singles make it a decent over for South Africa.</p> <p>\"Another memory of Strauss is him taking over the Middlesex captaincy after Gus Fraser decided in early season he would rather share a draughty press box and the pub with wizened hacks than trudge up and down the Lord's slope to see his best slower ball rocket past his head to awaken a dozing member,\" says Phil McBryde. \"Although Strauss was next in line for the captaincy, the timing was unexpected. As it turns out, Strauss's calmness, authority and integrity were not unexpected. We survived, Strauss prospered and English cricket greeted a new hero in 2004.\"</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 211-9 (M Morkel b Anderson 7)</strong> Anderson knocks over another sucker. Morne Morkel is the sixth batsman who has been bowled in this innings. He was just beaten for pace by a quick, straight delivery bowled from around the wicket.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 211 all out (Tsotsobe LBW b Anderson 0)</strong> Jimmy Anderson pins the No11 Tsotsobe in front for a golden duck. Tsotsobe is going to review it \u2013 as the last man, he might as well \u2013&#xa0;but this looks good. Yep, he's out. It was hitting the top of middle and leg, so that's the end of the innings. Anderson ends with four for 44, while Jade Dernbach (three for 44) and Ravi Bopara (one for 31) were also excellent. Hashim Amla was top scorer yet again, though thankfully he made a mere 43 this time. That's a very good effort in the field from England, who need 212 to square the series. They should manage that. <em>Should.</em> See you in half an hour for England 188 all out (47.2 overs).</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 1-0 (target 212; Cook 0, Bell 0)</strong> Dale Steyn is going to open the bowling, a slight surprise given what Lonwabo Tsotsobe did to Alastair Cook's off stump in the first over on Tuesday. Steyn's second ball is a leg-side wide; everything else is a non-event.</p> <p>\"Strauss won,\" says David Slider. \"This may be a peculiarly American perspective, but that is the basis for judging his captaincy. Much has been said of his character, and rightly so. But would you consider him differently if his results been more modest?\" I don't think so, no. In fact you could argue the opposite \u2013 that being so successful made his innate decency even more impressive. Many serial winners are swine.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 13-0 (target 212; Cook 0, Bell 12)</strong> Tsotsobe starts from the other end. His first ball is a touch short and timed supremely through the covers for four by Bell. Bell gets a second boundary from his third ball with a thick-edged steer wide of slip \u2013 and a third from his fifth delivery, clouting a contemptuous pull over midwicket. You never know how things will pan out with Ian Bell, but since his return to the side in June he has looked a seriously good one-day opener: <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/9062.html?class=2;spanmin1=01+May+2012;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">451 runs at 64.42 with a strike rate of 88</a>.</p> <p>\"I am joining you and Selvey for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/cricket-journalism\">cricket writing Masterclass (sic)</a> on 15th Sept \u2013 any chance of some sneak homework up front so I can make a good impression on Selvey and the other Masterclassmates?\" says Howard Walwyn. \"Does he like an apple?\" For a nominal fee, just \u00a34712.94, I'll post you the whole thing beforehand. Actually I think we'll be sending you a plan anyway. As for Selve, just don't mention the Gordon Greenidge LBW that wasn't at Old Trafford in 1976. He goes the full Hulk if you tell him it was clearly missing leg.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 14-1 (Bell LBW b Steyn 12)</strong> I'm sorry. Ian Bell has been jinxed by some moron. He was plumb LBW to Dale Steyn, whipping across the line as the ball homed in on his front pad. Even though Bell walked down the pitch a touch, it was hitting leg stump three quarters of the way up. Bell made 12 from seven balls.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 15-1 (target 212; Cook 0, Trott 1)</strong> In fascinating news, that's only the second time an England batsman has made 12 from seven balls in an ODI. Obviously you'll all know that the first came from <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65252.html\">Ronnie Irani against Namibia at Port Elizabeth during the 2003 World Cup</a>.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 16-1 (target 212; Cook 0, Trott 2)</strong> Tsotsobe shrieks like a defiled cat when Cook inside edges a delivery through the vacant short leg area. Cook is yet to get off the mark, having faced 11 deliveries.</p> <p>\"Straussy moment?\" says Steve Anthony. \"The way he celebrates a ton, as if clubbing an invisible errant urchin over the head... actually always worried he might one day brain someone. Otherwise, yes a quiet hero: classy batsman and classy captain. Classy bloke all round. Strauss for ICC president!\"</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 17-1 (target 212; Cook 0, Trott 3)</strong> Faf du Plessis made 1 with the bat today, but he is always worth a few in the field and has just saved at least one with a Jonty leap at backward point. Cook is beaten later in the over, chopping over the top of a slower ball that grubs and bounces twice before reaching de Villiers. He has 0 from 15 balls and will do well to keep his job for the next game on Sunday.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 24-1 (target 212; Cook 4, Trott 6)</strong> Trott bread-and-butters Tsotsobe off the thigh through midwicket for three. Then Cook gets off the mark from his 18th delivery, working Tsotsobe off the hip for four. Tsotsobe has bowled a heap of pucky thus far.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 35-1 (target 212; Cook 10, Trott 11)</strong> Steyn almost picks up Trott yet again, with an inside edge flashing past the stumps and down to the fine-leg boundary. There's an authentic boundary off the final ball, however, with Cook flashing a superb square drive.</p> <p>\"I realise that generally the captaincy is given to a batsman, and quite often the vice-captaincy too, but as part of the new 'era' I've heard Stuart Broad's name banded around as a vice, along with Swann and Prior,\" says Jonathan Hawke. \"Am I being ridiculous in finding it odd that Jimmy A's name isn't in that mix? Is it just the fact that he's a bit older that he's not being considered and Broad is \u2013 but surely by that logic that would do for Swann too?\" Yes, good point. He clearly has a very good cricket brain. Maybe there is a perception that he is too quiet off the field, bromantic tour video diaries notwithstanding.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 40-1 (target 212; Cook 10, Trott 16)</strong> Morne Morkel is greeted with a beautiful cover drive for four from Trott, who \u2013 as he often does in both forms of the game \u2013&#xa0;has started very quickly. He has 16 from 14 balls. Cook, walking across his stumps, is <em>this</em> close to being bowled round his legs. England have had a few moments of fortune but are going well. They need 172 from 42 overs.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 41-1 (target 212; Cook 10, Trott 17)</strong> The left-armer Wayne Parnell comes on for Dale Steyn (4-0-14-1). He beats Trott with consecutive deliveries, the first a beauty that lifts and seams. Then another delivery keeps a bit low; England need to watch that.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 45-1 (target 212; Cook 10, Trott 21)</strong> Trott hustles Morkel off the hip for two, and then clips off the pad for two more. Truth be told, I'm sidetracked by the exploits of Laura Robson at the US Open. She is one set up on the No9 seed Li Na, and the second set is about to go to a tiebreak.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 48-1 (target 212; Cook 12, Trott 22)</strong> Parnell beats Cook with a lovely delivery in Geoffrey Boycott Corridor. But, as we know, what's past is prologue for Cook and Trott; they won't let these false strokes perturb them, especially as runs are coming at a decent rate. Three from Parnell's over.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 52-1 (target 212; Cook 16, Trott 22)</strong> You're all in the pub/watching the Paralympics/watching Laura Robson/watching Sky Sports News aren't you? Faf du Plessis makes another decent save at backward point when Cook launches into a cut stroke at Morne Morkel. After five dot balls, Cook dumps a pull through midwicket for four from well wide of off stump.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 53-1 (target 212; Cook 16, Trott 23)</strong> \"I'm still here,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"I thought my wife was going to be picking me up about an hour ago, but there's no sign of her. I probably should not have reminded her about the cheese grater.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 53-1 (target 212; Cook 16, Trott 23)</strong> Trott edges Morkel just short of Smith, lurking in a wide slip position. Although England are in a superb position, batting hasn't been particularly comfortable. A maiden from Morkel, and the pressure is starting to build. England have scored just 13 from the last six overs. </p> <p>\"Looky-likeys,\" says Paul Howarth. \"<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://cdn2.mamapop.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kevin-spacey-seven-7.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.mamapop.com/2011/11/cinematic-cravings-the-top-5-non-food-movies-that-make-me-hungry.html/kevin-spacey-seven-7&amp;h=270&amp;w=400&amp;sz=25&amp;tbnid=oCnWdmSLu-SoMM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=133&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dkevin%2Bspacey%2Bseven%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=kevin+spacey+seven&amp;usg=__NbZlkyOIrSJkSxBCljqboPMEUwk=&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=otBAUMGCIurB0QXapoD4Bw&amp;ved=0CCwQ9QEwAg&amp;dur=2316\">James Tredwell</a>?\" <strong>OH THAT'S RIGHT, ALL BALD PEOPLE LOOK THE SAME</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 57-1 (target 212; Cook 18, Trott 25)</strong> England give the scoreboard the kiss of life with three quick singles off Parnell.<br>\"Nah, I'm still here listening and reading,\" says Chris Drew. \"What is your take on a new opener for England? Old blood or new blood?\"</p> <p>I don't really know that much about county cricket to be honest. Root clearly has something about him and, even though it might be a year early, if it was an easier series than India away I'd be tempted to throw him in. Not India away, though. Zaheer Khan could scar him, not to mention the spinners. I don't like the idea of Trott opening \u2013 there's enough upheaval as it is \u2013 and I reckon they might take the relatively safe option of Carberry. But I don't really know. Who are the other contenders? Send your sales pitches to <a href=\"mailto:rob.smyth@theguardian.com\">rob.smyth@theguardian.com</a></p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 59-1 (target 212; Cook 19, Trott 26)</strong> South Africa take their bowling Powerplay. Nothing happens. \"Actually, Rob, I've had the gasman round checking my boiler, hence the lack of emails from me,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"I may watch Celebrity Masterchef in a bit. The party never <strike> starts </strike> stops at Sawyer Towers. I can't help feeling my Friday evenings used to be much more interesting. I'm not so much going out with a bang as with a slow, melancholy drizzle.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 61-2 (Cook c Elgar b Peterson 20)</strong> End times for Alastair Cook. He pulled a terrible short delivery from the new bowler Robin Peterson straight to deep midwicket, where Dean Elgar took a simple catch as he fell backwards. Cook never really got going during an innings of 20 from 47 balls. It's the pressure of captaincy!</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 61-2 (target 212; Trott 27, Bopara 0)</strong> The new batsman is the man Nasser Hussain calls Bow-para. \"I'm here Rob!\" whispers Rose Williams. \"Getting off my face on gin in my dressing gown at a steady pace following some major dental work. You're keeping me occupied whilst I wait for my boyfriend to return and remind me what the Sky password is so I can watch our glorious victory. Friday night woooo!\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 64-3 (Bopara c de Villiers b Morkel 0)</strong> What's happened here? Ravi Bopara is given out caught behind off Morkel but reviews the decision instantly. There was a big noise but it was a dullish noise, so I reckon he's hit the pad with his bat. This is really interesting. Hotspot shows nothing but I think you can see an edge on one of the close-up replays, if not the others. Or can you? Lord knows. I've no idea what the third umpire Simon Taufel should do here. My instinct is that Bopara isn't out, but that he must be given out because there isn't enough evidence to overturn the on-field decision. Here comes the decision: he's out! There are boos from the crowd; that's out of order. Bopara is very unhappy, and has a word with Kumar Dharmasena on the way off. It's a bad time for him to get such a controversial decision, because he really needs some runs.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 64-3 (target 212; Trott 30, Morgan 0)</strong> We'll hear more about that dismissal if England lose, but I'm not sure what else the umpires could have done in the circumstances. Hotspot's verdict is not absolute.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 66-3 (target 212; Trott 31, Morgan 1)</strong> The thot plickens: Snicko suggests there was an edge. England had a famous grievance with the third umpire Simon Taufel at Sydney in 1999 but I don't think they should have one with him here. Even if Snicko had shown nothing, he was following the correct procedure by giving Bopara out.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 69-3 (target 212; Trott 31, Morgan 4)</strong> Excellent captaincy from AB de Villiers, who has brought back Dale Steyn for a crack at Eoin Morgan. If South Africa get Morgan early they will be strong favourites. No dice in that over, which costs three.</p> <p>\"I was listening to TMS and no-one seemed to mention Alex Hales,\" says Adam Roberts. \"Is he in contention? Living abroad, I don't follow county cricket as often as I did, but with 99 in a T20 international and a big century against the league leaders, is he worth a shout?\" He could be, although he hasn't had a great season.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 76-3 (target 212; Trott 32, Morgan 10)</strong> A lovely stroke from Morgan, who charges Peterson and swipes him over mid off for four. He just plays, doesn't he? Balls to how tense the situation might be; he just plays. If only he had been able to do that in Test cricket. Later in the over he pulls out the reverse sweep for a single. England need 136 from 29 overs.</p> <p>\"We've had Snickometer for a long time now, and it's generally reckoned to be the most accurate indicator of ball hitting bat or pad/sleeve/glove because the sounds are so different,\" says John Starbuck. \"But when Hotspot came along it became the most-favoured, presumably on speed grounds. Why? Is there no way to progress Snicko so it can be used faster? Or is Big Finance involved somewhere?\" As far as I'm aware, it's a simple speed issue, but I don't really know.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 82-3 (target 212; Trott 34, Morgan 14)</strong> Morgan smashes a short ball from Parnell through the covers. The brilliant du Plessis chases it all the way and dives forward to save a single approximately 0.0004 seconds before the ball hits the boundary rope. \"Just been catching up on all the Strauss tributes and memories on this OBO,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Could I add his century at Lord's earlier this year? His sheer delight at reaching it was touching for a man so usually reserved, and the prolonged ovation the crowd gave him was a mark of just how much appreciation and affection there is for the man who led the England team to heights I'd never dreamed they could reach. A really lovely memory.\"</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 88-3 (target 212; Trott 37, Morgan 17)</strong> Morgan wasn't fluent the other night but he is playing with his usual intimidating authority here. Six from Peterson's over, and Morgan has 17 from as many balls. Damn he's good. That's right:<em> damn</em>.</p> <p>\"It's Friday and I'm Finnish, so cricket or no cricket, I was in the sauna,\" says Sara Torvalds. \"But now I'm done, all mellow and fresh, so let's have some genius big hitting from Ireland's little big man!\" Preach on sistah.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 96-3 (target 212; Trott 37, Morgan 25)</strong> Tsotsobe's first ball back is blazed over mid off for four by Morgan. He wasn't quite aiming there, and it went very high, but there was enough power behind it to get it safely over the infield. Three balls later he savages a cut stroke past backward point for four. Outstanding batting. No matter how long it takes, England simply have to find a way to make a Test player out of this bloke, because he could be devastating enforcer/initiative-seizer at No5 or No6. He is a genius.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 99-3 (target 212; Trott 40, Morgan 25)</strong> <br>\"Good to hear that other people's Friday nights aren't the heady mix of hedonism and romance that we expect from OBO followers,\" says Luke Williams. \"Personally, I'm off the pop owing to a course of superstrength antibiotics for a nasty rash \u2013 specifically Lyme disease, from an infected tick bite. My girlfriend isn't coming out and sounds totally frazzled as she's making a wedding cake (not ours) and it's not going so well, and I'm heading for the pub to play guitar and drink coffee while the Whole Rest Of The World is getting totally off its face. Bah!\" </p> <p>That sounds like a truly miserable existence. In fact, the only possible thing worse than that would be to be at work receiving an email detailing such an existence. Bah squared.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 110-3 (target 212; Trott 43, Morgan 31)</strong> Trott drives Tsotsobe through the diving Steyn at mid off for a couple to bring up the hundred, and a misfield from Morne Morkel at fine leg gives Morgan a second later in the over. There are two wides from Tsotsobe, and then Morgan threads a gorgeous cover drive between extra cover and mid off for four. His placement is outstanding. He only has 31, but this has been a masterclass in taking control of a precariously poised contest.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 112-3 (target 212; Trott 44, Morgan 32)</strong> Two from Peterson's over. \"What a mouthwatering middle order we could have of Bell, Bairstow and Morgan,\" says Russell Hope. \"Surely the best all-ginger 4, 5 &amp; 6 ever!\" And possibly the only one. Did anyone play alongside Bell and Collingwood?</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 116-3 (target 212; Trott 44, Morgan 35)</strong> Here comes the left-arm spinner Dean Elgar, who turned the ball sharply at times on Tuesday. He goes around the wicket to Morgan, who can't get the first four deliveries away but then places a nice extra-cover drive for three. That brings up a fine fifty partnership from only 59 balls.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 118-3 (target 212; Trott 45, Morgan 36)</strong> Parnell replaces Peterson (6-0-22-1) and so nearly gets the vital wicket of Morgan, who spoons a slower ball <em>this</em> far short of Morkel, running in from mid off and diving forward. His right buttock landed on the ball as he attempted to take the catch, and he's in a fair bit of pain. After a bit of treatment he'll be okay. Graeme Smith is laughing his head off, and even Morkel, one of the more amiable souls in cricket, has a half smile/half grimace on his coupon.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 120-3 (target 212; Trott 46, Morgan 37)</strong> Having seized the initiative, England can play it fairly safe now and there are just two from Elgar's over. Trott, who scored 16 from his first 14 deliveries, has made 30 from 67 since then.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 120-3 (target 212; Trott 46, Morgan 37)</strong> South Africa need Morgan. If they get him soon they still have a chance, because England have a longish tail with either Finn or Anderson at No9. Morgan misses a cut and mistimes a pull during a maiden over from Parnell; he has struggled to time it in the last few overs.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 129-3 (target 212; Trott 48, Morgan 44)</strong> Morgan releases the burgeoning pressure with a sweet six off Elgar. He came down the track to get the ball on the full and pinged it handsomely over midwicket. That's the first six of the match. A leading edge from Trott later in the over lands safely on the off side. England need 83 from 108 balls.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 136-3 (target 212; Trott 50, Morgan 49)</strong> If you need a wicket, and nobody else can help, then you'd better bring on Dale Steyn. He returns to replace Parnell, and Morgan walks across the stumps to flick him fine for four. That is lovely batting again. A single from Trott brings him to a crucial, unobtrusive half-century from 84 balls. Trott has played 50 ODI innings, and this is the 21st time he has reached fifty. That's an outrageous statistic.</p> <p>\"Have any of your readers noticed the resemblance between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/31/neil-armstrong-modest-memorial\">Neil Armstrong and Ian Bell</a>?\" says Peter Hill. \"Are they by any chance related?\"</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 142-3 (target 212; Trott 54, Morgan 51)</strong> Tsotsobe is back for Elgar. He hasn't bowled well today, and his third ball, on the pads, is flicked crisply for three by Jonathan Trott. That brings Morgan on strike, and he flicks a single to reach a high-class fifty from only 54 balls, a fantastic rate of scoring on a slowish pitch. As ever, the pleasure has been all ours. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/24598.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=start;spanmin1=01+May+2012;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">This summer Morgan is averaging 111 in ODIs at a strike rate of 103</a>. That's quite the return to form after his hideous winter. At times he makes it look offensively easy.</p> <p>\"For all the stick Trott gets is there a better batsman in pursuit of a low total than him in ODIs?\" says Peter Robertson. \"In these sort of situations when our bowling attack shows up its very soothing to have him plodding along with the minimum of fuss at No3.\" Yep. In 15 years' time, as we reflect on this golden age of English cricket, we may well find the constant discussion of Trott's place completely absurd.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 150-3 (target 212; Trott 55, Morgan 57)</strong> Steyn's first ball is full, in the slot and driven majestically over extra cover for a one-bounce four by Morgan. He is a joy to watch when he bats like this. \"I've just seen Sergio Ramos eating a bag of Cheesy Wotsits on the Seven Sisters Road,\" says Niall Mullen. \"Sorry wrong blog. Ooh look there's cricket on.\" How can you be worried about that filth when Eoin Morgan is batting? You sicken me.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 160-3 (target 212; Trott 56, Morgan 66)</strong> England have to take their batting Powerplay. Will Morgan go for it or just nurdle a few singles? That's what sets him apart; he's both a punisher and a nurdler. He flicks a low full toss from Tsotsobe behind square, with Amla doing brilliantly to save two runs \u2013 and the next ball is launched over mid off for six! Sensational stuff from Morgan. He charged Tsotsobe and blootered him over the ropes like it was the most obvious thing in the world. You can keep your exhilaratingly depraved coke orgies: <em>this</em> is how to spend a Friday night. If there's anything better in this world than watching Eoin Morgan bat like this, it certainly won't legal.</p> <p>\"Well, I've just finished my evening meal of duck sausages, chips and baked beans, followed by Stilton and a plum sponge pudding, all washed down with a decent Rioja (my wife is away on a cookery course this weekend) and I'm looking forward to rounding off the evening with the OBO, TMS and what we should now be calling a 'developing' England team,\" says John Starbuck. \"It's not always bad, though the rain is falling so heavily I doubt I'll be trimming the hedge tomorrow. What's not to like?\" You had me at duck sausages.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 167-3 (target 212; Trott 59, Morgan 70)</strong> Morkel is back into the attack. It's now or never for South Africa, and other cliches. Morgan blasts him wide of mid off for yet another boundary to bring up a hundred partnership that has been dominated almost entirely by the sparkling Morgan. He has 70 from 64 balls; England need 45 from 78 balls.</p> <p>\"Morgan is one of those players who are good to listen to even on the radio,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Never mind the eulogising by the commentators, he's middled some shots tonight so well that the loud crack of bat on ball over the airwaves is a pleasure to the old lugholes.\" His power is ridiculous for a small chap. His forearms make Popeye look like Mr Puniverse.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 172-4 (Morgan ct and b Peterson 72)</strong> This is a decent move from AB de Villiers, who has gone back to Robin Peterson. Their only hope is to get Morgan, and bringing back the spinner during a Powerplay just might tempt him into a mistake. And he has! Morgan toe-ended a slog-sweep straight up in the air, allowing Peterson to take a simple return catch. The ball slipped out of his hand as he went to throw it up in celebration, and the umpires conferred before rightly deciding he had the ball under control. Morgan waves his bat to the crowd after another storming innings: 73 from 67 balls with seven fours and two sixes.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 172-4 (target 212; Trott 61, Kieswetter 0)</strong> England need 40 from 72 balls with six wickets remaining. They have lost from better positions in the past, but it would take a real shocker for them to blow this.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 174-4 (target 212; Trott 62, Kieswetter 1)</strong> Just a couple from Morkel's over. \"I'm struggling to work out who jinxed Morgan there,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Is it me or you taking the rap for that one?\" I blame KP.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! England 176-4 (Kieswetter not out 3)</strong> Kieswetter pushes around his front pad at Peterson and survives a big LBW shout. South Africa have to review this because of the match situation as much as anything. I think Kieswetter will be okay. Yep, it was sliding down the leg side.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 182-4 (target 212; Trott 62, Kieswetter 9)</strong> Kieswetter's response to the review is to drag the next ball high over mid-on for six. Lovely shot. For all Kieswetter's imperfections, the boy hits sixes. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=sixes;team=1;template=results;type=batting\">He's already ninth of the all-time England list</a>, and all those above him have played a lot more games.</p> <p>\"Duck sausages?\" sniffs Matt Dony. \"Stilton? Specifying a particular wine? I don't want to make generalisation, but John Starbuck sounds like he might be the ideal Guardian reader. He middles class as well as Morgan middles shots. It was a joy, that innings.\" It sure was. Some people are even saying it was almost as good as a plate of duck sausages.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 188-4 (target 212; Trott 64, Kieswetter 13)</strong> Elgar returns to the attack. Trott takes a dodgy single to backward point and would have been out with a direct hit. Six from the over.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 189-5 (Kieswetter run out 14)</strong> Kieswetter hammers a full toss straight back at the bowler Peterson, who puts down a routine chance. He struggled to pick the ball up and it hit him on the arm. He's actually lucky it wasn't heading for his coupon or that could have been nasty. Not that it matters because Kieswetter is run out three balls later. Trott took a tight single to the mid-on Parnell, whose excellent throw was taken in front of the stumps by the keeper de Villiers. He demolished the stumps with Kieswetter fractionally short of his ground. I think that was Kieswetter's fault; he was ballwatching for just a second and that was decisive.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 189-5 (target 212; Trott 64, Patel 0)</strong> Twenty three runs, five wickets, 48 balls. Pulitzer please!</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 191-5 (target 212; Trott 66, Patel 0)</strong> Just two from Parnell's over, worked into the leg side by Trott. England need 21 from 42 balls.</p> <p>\"@hobokencc, www.hobokencc.com urgently need one or two gentlemen players, or gentlemen or players (we cater to ladies too) for a match in Greenwich, CT on Sunday against that bastion of Englishness, Maddogs CC.,\" says Simon. \"Get in touch on twitter or the website.\"</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 194-5 (target 212; Trott 67, Patel 2)</strong> Peterson finishes with figures of 10-0-39-2. With 18 needed, it's surely time for one last burst from Dale Steyn. </p> <p>\"Thank you Eoin Morgan,\" says Simon McMahon. \"England back to No1 in the world in ODIs. What a start to Friday night. I'm off to build The Sovereign of the Seas now. Then an exhilaratingly depraved coke orgy later. Maybe even some crisps too. Duck-flavoured ones, of course.\"</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 197-5 (target 212; Trott 68, Patel 3)</strong> A <em>huge</em> front-foot no-ball from Parnell \u2013 even bigger than Mohammad Amir's two years ago \u2013 gives Patel a free hit. Patel is almost run out off that free hit. He timed it to Elgar in the covers, who could have thrown the ball at either end with the batsmen stuck in the middle of the pitch. He went for the bowler's end, but the throw missed and Patel survived. That was very strange. The Sky commentators reckon Patel forgot it was a free hit. Bless him. He's so very talented but he'll never escape that Frank Spencer gene.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 206-5 (target 212; Trott 71, Patel 8)</strong> In 1991, on her epic meditation on ends and means, Oleta Adams famously implored: \"I don't care how you get here, get here if you can.\" England aren't exactly hurtling over the finish line \u2013&#xa0;there hasn't been a four since the 37th over \u2013 but they are getting there, drip by drip. After a few more singles, Patel gets things moving by drilling Morkel sweetly over mid-on for four. That's a fine shot, not least because it increases my chances of making the 2055 from St Pancras. Give it some humpty you pair of eejits!</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 207-6 (Trott c de Villiers b Parnell 71)</strong> There goes Jonathan Trott, and th go my chances of making the 2055. He edged Parnell straight through to AB de Villiers and departs for an excellent 71, made from 125 balls with just two fours. As usual, Trott played precisely the innings the match situation demanded.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 207-6 (target 212; Patel 8, Tredwell 0)</strong> England need five from three overs. Parnell ends with fine figures of 10-1-23-1.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>48 overs: England 215-6 (Patel 16, Tredwell 1). ENGLAND WIN BY FOUR WICKETS</strong> Samit Patel finishes the job off Morne Morkel, and England have squared the series with a good victory. They also return to No1 in the ODI rankings, until Sunday at least. Love to stop and chat but I've a train to catch. Bye!</p>",
  "<p>If there was anyone who still harboured a remaining scintilla of doubt that Paralympic sport is as brutal, raw and arbitrary as its Olympic counterpart then an extraordinary five minutes in the velodrome on Friday must have utterly removed it.</p> <p>Jody Cundy, a lower-leg amputee seeking his sixth Paralympic gold medal in his fifth Games and a strong favourite in the C4/5 1km time trial, was disqualified in controversial circumstances and exploded into an expletive-fuelled rant as he realised four years of hard training had been destroyed by the commissaire's decision.</p> <p>Having signalled that he believed the starting gate had not opened properly and raised his hand for a restart, Cundy said afterwards that it slowly dawned on him as he watched his time continue to tick round on the scoreboard that a once in a lifetime opportunity had gone.</p> <p>Cundy, who had his right leg amputated at the age of three, stormed off and \u2013 in his words \u2013 \"lost it\".</p> <p>He raged at the officials, hurled a water bottle to the floor, collapsed in a heap and then had to be restrained by his team mechanic as he advanced towards the commissaire who disqualified him.</p> <p>As he was led away from the scene and down into the bowels of the velodrome and the crowd, he railed against the decision in stark terms.</p> <p>\"I fell out of the gate because the fucking thing won't open. Yet here I am, I can't ride. Everybody else gets the fucking re-ride,\" he said, as a British official tried to calm him down and his girlfriend raced to his side.</p> <p>\"Do you know what it's like? Four years of my life. I'll never get the chance to do it. In front of a 6,000 home crowd, I'll never get this opportunity ever, ever again. Never. What am I supposed to do?\"</p> <p>Cundy and his coach, Chris Furber, argued that the gate had not opened properly due to a mechanical error, but Louis Barbeau, the technical delegate of the International Cycling Union (UCI), insisted there was nothing wrong with the gate and that the rider's wheel had slipped because he put too much pressure on the front wheel.</p> <p>The UCI refused to review the incident on television monitors and said there was no right of appeal.</p> <p>For the watching crowd, who booed the decision not to allow Cundy a restart and cheered at equal volume later when he came back to apologise, there were echoes of Victoria Pendleton's disqualification four weeks earlier when she and Jessica Varnish were disqualified from the team sprint for making an illegal changeover.</p> <p>The opacity of the rules surrounding starts, which Cundy later said needed to be urgently clarified, were demonstrated by the fact that fellow British riders Lora Turnham and Fiona Duncan were granted a restart in the morning in the tandem race after the gate was judged to have failed.</p> <p>As Cundy also pointed out, during the Olympics, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/03/philip-hindes-british0cycling-crash\" title=\"\">Philip Hindes was able to \"deck\" his bike</a> during Team GB's Olympic team sprint victory to secure a restart.</p> <p>The frustration was all the more intense because Cundy had been recording personal best after personal best in training and knew that his world record in the C4 class was faster than that recorded minutes earlier in the C5 by the eventual winner, the Spaniard Alfonso Cabello.</p> <p>\"I'm in the absolute form of my life. So I knew I was in the shape to go and win the gold medal. I got into the start gate, the gun went off and I didn't go anywhere. I instantly put my hand up to show a mishap and came off the track,\" said Cundy.</p> <p>Because the classes are combined, Cundy would also have the \"factoring\" \u2013 which reduces the times of more seriously impaired riders when two or more classes are grouped together \u2013 in his favour.</p> <p>If the pain was intense for Cundy, whose prosthetic leg was painted in a union flag to match his Stella McCartney-designed kit, then it was doubled for his watching family.</p> <p>\"As soon as I saw him sit down, I knew he wasn't going to race again. It is the only way the UCI have got of stopping him,\" said his father, Alan, one of a large group of family and friends who were there to watch, including the woman who saved Cundy from drowning when he was five.</p> <p>As he composed himself afterwards, Cundy, who won three of his Paralympic golds in the pool before following the same path as Sarah Storey and switching to cycling before the Beijing Games, said he struggled to rationalise what had just happened.</p> <p>\"I've sworn a bit more. Cried a little bit. My girlfriend was there for me, we hugged it out,\" he said.</p> <p>As if to further emphasise the slings and arrows of elite sport, while Cundy was raging outside the call room, his teammate Mark Colbourne was racing to gold in the C1 1km time trial as the crowd roared him home.</p> <p>It was Colbourne's second medal in as many days, and one of seven that ParalympicsGB have now secured in the velodrome. Cundy's teammate and rival Jon-Allan Butterworth won silver behind Cabello.</p> <p>At a hastily arranged press conference after the day's racing had been completed to apologise to \"the IPC, UCI, friends, spectators, everyone who watched\", Cundy said that, like Pendleton, he would seek redemption in the saddle on Saturday when he competes in the 4km pursuit.</p> <p>\"It's just a bike race. It's probably the most important bike race I've ever been part of. It's not often you get to compete at a home Games, in the best race, in the form of your life. That opportunity has gone now.</p> <p>\"It felt as if somebody had died, but they haven't. It's just a bike race. Although the 4km pursuit isn't my favoured event, I'm in good shape and there's no reason I can't try and make a medal final.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you're outside the United States, in Britain say, the last time you checked in Mitt Romney was the privileged, h<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgeQ_y7LMRI\" title=\"\">apless candidate born with a silver foot in his mouth</a> who had managed to screw up what should have been the easiest possible assignment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/britain-easy-date-mitt-romney-mess\" title=\"\">making nice to London on the eve of the Olympics</a> \u2013 and was surely destined to go down to defeat in November at the hands of that master rhetorician and campaigner, Barack Obama.</p> <p>If that's your view, you may want to sit down. For Romney and Obama are now locked in a bitingly tight contest, one that the Republican candidate has a good \u2013 and increasing \u2013 prospect of winning. On 7 November there is an even, maybe better than even, chance that the world will wake up to President Romney.</p> <p>This is not a verdict on Romney's speech here in Florida, formally accepting his party's nomination. That was a bland affair \u2013 even supporters called it \"workmanlike\" \u2013 which drew a tepid response in the hall. Nor did Romney reveal previously hidden gifts for oratory or suddenly show himself to be a warm, telegenic match for Obama. Instead it is an assessment of the basic political reality, one in which those defects of Romney's might not even matter.</p> <p>Start with two numbers that are horrible for Obama. The first is his poll rating, which remains stubbornly below 50%. History suggests that incumbent presidents unable to break the 50% barrier at this stage end up serving just one term. The second figure, which goes a long way to explaining the first, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-chijulyunemploymentjulyjobsreport-20120803,0,6114456.story\" title=\"\">is the statistic that puts US unemployment at 8.3%</a>. Joblessness has not stood below 8% since the month Obama took office. Again, the&#xa0;historical record is brutal on sitting presidents seeking re-election against such a bleak economic backdrop. The last one to pull it off was Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936.</p> <p>Viewed like that, the fact that Obama is even in a statistical dead-heat with Romney nationally is quite an achievement. It has come thanks in part to an aerial bombardment of TV advertising by the Obama campaign in decisive states, consisting mainly of 30-second attacks on Romney, depicting him as a corporate vulture who won't tell the truth about how much tax he pays. That such a heavy assault has only managed to result in stalemate illustrates the gravity of the president's situation.</p> <p>What's more, a serious Romney counter-attack is on the way. Under the rules of campaign finance, the Republican only gained access to his full war-chest on Thursday night, when he became his party's formal nominee. Unusually for a challenger, he is comprehensively out-fundraising Obama, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/22/news/economy/obama-romney-fundraising/index.html\" title=\"\">pulling in more than $200m in June and July alone</a>. Romney is backed too by a series of so-called Super Pacs (political action committees), officially unaffiliated bodies that are able to keep the source of their funds secret and who can spend unlimited amounts on TV commercials. Obama has some Super Pac allies of his own, but here too Romney has the advantage.</p> <p>The coming phase of the campaign holds further bright possibilities for the Republican candidate. Yes, Obama will get his moment in the sun next week as Democrats gather for their convention in Charlotte. But any momentum could come to an abrupt halt on Friday, when the latest job statistics are published.</p> <p>October brings three live TV debates between the two men, often landmark moments in a presidential contest. Of course these could go either way. If Romney stumbles so badly that he is deemed an implausible president, his bid will be over. But he is an experienced debater, battle-hardened by bruising primary campaigns this year and in 2008. And debates often help the challenger simply by putting him alongside the president, thereby granting him equal status.</p> <p>It's true that Romney is a stiff performer and cannot rival the charm and ease of Barack Obama. Likability usually matters a lot in US elections. But this could just be the year when it matters less. The case Republicans presented in Tampa was that the economy needs to be fixed and that Romney is the man to fix it. They point to a CV that shows Romney has succeeded in every task he has undertaken, whether as governor of Massachusetts or salvaging the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. So what if he can't emote and looks permanently awkward? He's a proven turnaround artist and, as his wife, Ann, said on Tuesday: <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ann-romney-tells-women-husband-us/story?id=17098633\" title=\"\">\"This man will not fail.\"</a></p> <p>Judged like this, Romney will not have to prove he's likable so much as \"acceptable\", say some of his senior allies, and that is a much lower bar. Thursday night's testimonials from church members Romney had helped as a Mormon lay pastor \u2013 telling clearly genuine stories of Romney coming to the aid of families faced with tragedy, including sitting with a dying 14-year-old boy who had asked for Romney's help drafting a will \u2013 suggest a way the candidate might clear that bar easily.</p> <p>Of course, Obama retains&#xa0;big advantages. Many Americans still like him and think well of him. They believe he has tried his best, having been dealt a tough hand by his predecessor. They credit him with the removal of&#xa0;America's number one enemy and the&#xa0;rescue of the country's car industry. As the bumper sticker has it: \"Bin Laden's dead and GM's alive.\"</p> <p>They still do not know Mitt Romney well and might yet be persuaded that he is a pampered plutocrat whose wife owns \"a couple of Cadillacs\" and who is out&#xa0;of touch, whose own&#xa0;policy reversals over the years \u2013 on&#xa0;abortion and the like \u2013 suggest a hollowness, a willingness to do or say anything to gain power.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team is probably the more skilled. The Romney crowd can still mess up: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-obama-gop-convention-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">witness the debacle of Clint Eastwood's Dada-ist performance</a> in Tampa, talking to an empty chair. The control-freaks around Obama would have taken no such risk. And the Democrats retain key demographic advantages, favoured by Americans who are black, Hispanic, young or female. The electoral map is helpful too: in the states he has to win, the president is ahead. But that will not matter much if Romney pulls even a couple of percentage points ahead. Al Gore in 2000 apart, winners of the overall popular vote tend to become president.</p> <p>Put simply, if you thought of Mitt Romney as a joke figure bound to lose in November and soon to be forgotten, think again. This election is knife-edge close \u2013 and, to state what for many around the world will be an unwelcome truth, that means either man could win.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Those who question whether Paralympic sport can ever equal the drama of its able-bodied equivalent should have spent on Friday in the London velodrome. The wooden-clad swoop could be used for another half-century and fail to reach the same emotional peaks and troughs.</p> <p>In an afternoon session lasting less than three hours the crowd first saw \u2013 and heard at some volume \u2013 Jody Cundy's anguish and rage when officials decreed that the wheel-slip which derailed his 1km time trial was the rider's fault and did not merit a restart.</p> <p>Cundy had to be carried bodily away as he ran to remonstrate with the referees. He spent the next 15 minutes wailing and cursing in an airless tunnel under the wooden track, watched by note-scribbling reporters and anxious British officials. He later apologised for his actions but claimed the starting gate which releases the bike's rear wheel was faulty.</p> <p>The debate was still raging when Mark Colbourne, who believed three years ago that he would never walk again after a paragliding crash, took gold in the 4km individual pursuit for C1 cyclists, the most severely impaired class. For good measure he beat the world record he set in the heats.</p> <p>If Cundy was at one extreme of human emotion and Colbourne at the other, Darren Kenny, holder of six golds from previous Paralympics, had the unusual experience of feeling both at once. After qualifying a disappointing fourth in an event he won in Beijing, the 42-year-old set a world record in the race-off for bronze, a time neither finalist \u2013 Britain's Shaun McKeown took silver against Joseph Berenyi of the United States \u2013 exceeded.</p> <p>Mixed emotions were the order of the day, too, for Aileen McGlynn, who began the morning with a silver in the 1km time trial for visually impaired athletes riding tandem with a sighted pilot. The 39-year-old Scot won the event in Athens and Beijing and conceded she was \"a wee bit disappointed\" with second.</p> <p>There was an element of regret, too, for John-Allan Butterworth, the RAF technician-turned Paralympian who lost part of an arm in an insurgent attack in Iraq. He was delighted with silver in Cundy's event but aware his team-mate would otherwise probably have pushed him to bronze.</p> <p>Once Britain's cycling coaches have had a lie down in a darkened room they can reflect on a decent day's medal haul of one gold, three silvers and a bronze. GB have more cycling medals than anyone, seven, but are behind Australia and China in the overall table with two golds rather than three.</p> <p>For Cundy, however, serenity is some way away and might never be attained even if he wins Saturday's 4km pursuit, his weaker event.</p> <p>The 33-year-old, who took three Paralympic swimming golds before switching to the velodrome, where he won two more in Beijing, was as close to a nailed-on favourite as the sport provides in the time trial for C4 and C5 class riders. His C4 world record is quicker than Butterworth's equivalent, in the C5 class, for less physically impaired riders.</p> <p>Several hours after his outburst Cundy apologised for his repeated, shouted swearing on learning he could not race again and for trying to remonstrate with the officials as a \"red mist\" descended. \"Much as it's an embarrassment to be carried out of the velodrome it was probably the best situation for me to be in,\" he said.</p> <p>But while cycling's governing body, the UCI, maintained that the start gate had functioned perfectly, Cundy disagreed: \"The gun went off and I didn't go anywhere. The start gate held me.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It's not the end of the world, just a bike race \u2013 probably the most important bike race I've ever been part of. It's not often you get to compete in a home Games in the shape of your life. But that opportunity's gone now. It feels like somebody's died. They haven't, they've just missed a bike race.\"</p> <p>Butterworth said he was delighted with his silver but felt for his team-mate: \"I reckon he would have won that, with the way he's been going in training.\"</p> <p>The joy was less complicated for Colbourne, 42, who has been a track cyclist for only 18 months. \"It's a dream come true for me,\" he said. \"I've loved sport all my life. Even after my accident the first thing I wanted to do was find a sport I could get into. It doesn't stop you having a life. It just depends what you want to do with your life.\"</p> <p>Kenny said he had begun slowly in his morning heat to try to protect a knee he banged against a metal post in the velodrome the previous day. This consigned him to the bronze-medal race \u2013 where he promptly broke the world record. \"I got the tactics wrong this morning. That's the easy answer,\" he admitted.</p> <p>Paradoxically the British rider with the biggest smile of the day was the only other one apart from Cundy to leave without a medal. Lora Turnham, 23, came fourth in the tandem 1km time trial, her first taste of Paralympic competition. Both she and her pilot, Fiona Duncan, said they enjoyed every minute. \"It was great,\" Turnham said. \"We did a personal best \u2014 we've never gone faster. That's got to be good.\"</p>",
  "<p>It only takes a few minutes for the eyes and ears to adjust to blind, five-a-side football, for the spectators that is. And suddenly there you are, just watching football. Not blind football, or any other appendage that might be affixed to it, just football. The soundtrack is familiar as the crowd's reactions stick faithfully to the oohs and ahhs, gasps and sharp intakes of breath that accompany any football match, on the edge of their seats as the action unfolds \u2013 albeit forcibly muted because of the \"silent while the ball is in play\" rule.</p> <p>Most strikingly of all, perhaps, is how the movements of the players on the pitch are the same. They use the same physical vocabulary, darting runs, a control of the ball that takes your breath away, deft tackles, hard shots at goal and beautifully worked passing. When there is a corner the players hunch over panting, hands on their knees, when they come away from a crunching tackle their body recoils in much the same manner. And when they score the explosion is electric.</p> <p>Such was the feeling when Dave Clarke, at 41 years of age with three golden boots to his name and one of the undisputed stars of the sport, turned beautifully in front of goal and shot low and hard to level the score at 1-1 against the World Cup runners-up Spain, in Great Britain's opening game of the Paralympics. Delighted, he twirled straight into the referee, hugged him and ran to his team-mates to celebrate accompanied by loud applause from the stands. Over the course of five World Cups and six European Championships, Clarke has scored more goals for his country than Bobby Charlton and Gary Lineker's tallies combined \u2013 now 127 goals in 140 matches \u2013 but the one accolade that continues to evade him is a Paralympic medal. After finishing fifth in Beijing \u2013 Britain's Paralympic debut in the sport \u2013 Clarke, and everyone else in the team, is determined to retire with a podium finish.</p> <p>\"We're here to win a medal,\" said the characteristically straight-talking British captain. \"The result could have been better today, but it's good enough.\" Clarke spent much of the match being subbed on and off \u2013 in line with the rules there are unlimited substitutions allowed \u2013 after colliding with Spain's Marcelo Rosado Carrasco early in the first half which meant the silver-haired Briton was forced to play with a wad of cotton wool stuffed up his nose to stem the bleeding. \"It's nothing I couldn't get up from,\" he said, shrugging off the incident as something that happens in any form of the game, \"although I think it's probably going to end up being a black eye. I tried to spin down the boards and he stepped inside and his head hit my eye. Fair play to him, though, if he'd let me through I'd have been away.\"</p> <p>Clarke's 16 years in the sport showed not only on the pitch, but in his proficiency at batting away inane questions and observations from journalists unused to reporting on this form of the beautiful game. \"At least there was no diving,\" opined one journalist. \"Ha, I don't know about that,\" said Clarke. \"Is your hearing better than most people?\" asked another. \"It's not better, we just use it,\" he quipped. \"We haven't got the interruption of sight that you lot have to put up with. We just have a better sense of what's going on around us.\" What about shooting against a fully sighted goalkeeper? How can that be fair? Cue another grin. \"It looked pretty easy didn't it? It is hard, you've got three metres by two metres to aim for, it's not a big space, is it? But if you put it in the bottom left-hand corner he won't get to it, will he. You've just got to smash it.\"</p> <p>The goalkeeper Lewis Skyers can pay testimony to that. A former Conference-level keeper for Worcester City, Skyers switched to blind football \u2013 in which fully sighted and partially-sighted keepers are used \u2013 after falling in love with the sport. \"Some of the principles of goalkeeping are the same. But it's when they're getting closer and they're bearing down on you. You want to come out of your area and can't, so you just have to make yourself as big as possible. It's mainly reaction shot-stopping. I've tried to explain it to a few friends of mine, but they couldn't quite get it into their heads. They shoot from on average about five to six yards out, and it's just reactions. That's the part of the game that I love. When they hit it as hard as they do, you can see how it goes in.\"</p> <p>Keepers play a vital role in directing the action on the pitch, shouting instructions to their team-mates. \"I've lost my voice a little bit now,\" laughed Skyers after two, 25-minute halves of yelling orders. Arguably Great Britain could employ anyone in the role \u2013 Joe Hart would be eligible \u2013 but Skyers is not sure that even the best Premier League keepers would be suitable for the job. \"In a way, they could pick whoever they wanted,\" he nods. \"We had a goalkeeper who came from a professional club. He had one training session and didn't enjoy it. He didn't last very long. It is another speciality altogether, and I'm trying to keep the shirt for as long as possible.\"</p> <p>If the profile of blind, five-a-side football in the last year is anything to go by Skyers could be in for competition after David Beckham got involved with the sport to promote it and succeeded in attracting three million youngsters to the game. \"He did a lot for us,\" said Clarke. \"I think that's fantastic that he brought blind football to the world. I had phone calls from Australia, Vietnam, the United States, all from people who found out about blind football due to him so he's done his bit.\"</p> <p>Next up Britain play Argentina, who won against Iran to top the group on Friday, before facing the lowest-ranked Iran in their attempt to progress from the group stage.</p>",
  "<p>After losing four houses to four hurricanes Melanie Martinez was arguably America's unluckiest woman. There was Betsy in 1965, Juan in 1985, George in 1998 and Katrina in 2005, ferocious storms that swept in from the Gulf of Mexico&#xa0;and wrecked each of Martinez's homes. Such was the&#xa0;peril of living on a flood plain in Louisiana.</p> <p>A few months ago the schoolbus driver's luck changed. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/garden/a-house-makeover-show-has-its-debut-on-ae-network-qa.html\" title=\"\">Hideous Houses</a>, a reality TV show on the A&amp;E channel, selected her not quite hideous but admittedly ramshackle house in Braithwaite, a rural town just south of New Orleans, for a makeover. The host, Eric Stromer (one of the sexiest people alive, according to People magazine), and his team spent a week and $20,000 transforming the Martinez home with a new kitchen, new cupboards, new appliances (including a 50in smart&#xa0;TV), even creating a new room for Melanie's passion, sewing. It aired a few weeks ago. \"They did a real good job. I loved it,\" says Martinez.</p> <p>If you were paying attention to the news last week you know where this story is going. On Wednesday 29 August \u2013 the seventh anniversary of Katrina \u2013 a category 1 hurricane named Isaac howled in from the Gulf and hit Mississippi and Louisiana. A $14.5bn federally funded bolstering of flood-control systems around New Orleans <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/30/hurricane-isaac-new-orleans-defences\" title=\"\">spared the city</a>. However, Braithwaite was sheltered only by an 8ft levee built by Louisiana's state government. Thus Martinez became \u2013 who could now argue? \u2013 America's unluckiest woman.</p> <p>\"There was a mandatory evacuation order and we were leaving, just like our neighbours,\" she says. \"We never stay for storms. I&#xa0;would never jeopardise my mom \u2013 she's 74 and needs dialysis. But my truck broke down.\" Around 2am floodwaters \"overtopped\" the levee, sending a 12ft surge through Braithwaite. The family sought refuge in the attic. \"We thought we were going to die in that house; the water was coming up so fast. My husband used a hammer to put a hole in the roof but it broke. We used our hands and feet to punch the hole.\"</p> <p>A boat rescued them along with their five kittens and three dogs. Everything else was lost. \"Now I've lost five houses to five storms. Every time a wipe-out.\" Martinez seems grateful to be alive, even perky, but knows tears will come once waters subside and she returns to a sodden wreck. \"Why live in Louisiana?\" She ponders the question. \"I was born here. It's home, home, home. But we want to move somewhere that's hilly, you know? To a house on a hill.\"</p>",
  "<p>The new leader of Britain's doctors names Nye Bevan, the chief architect of the National Health Service, among his political heroes, suggesting he is probably not the biggest fan of the coalition's hugely controversial NHS shakeup.</p> <p>Dr Mark Porter describes his personal politics as \"progressive, liberal, left as opposed to right, though not dogmatically so\" and himself as \"somebody who is imbued with a sense of social justice, rather than having the economic imperative ruling everything \u2013 a Guardian reader as perhaps opposed to a Telegraph reader.\"</p> <p>The health and social care bill saga and doctors' dispute over their pensions resulted in regular TV and radio appearances by Porter's predecessor as the British Medical Association's chair of council, Dr Hamish Meldrum. With the pensions issue still unresolved \u2013 on 21 June it prompted the first industrial action by medics since 1974 \u2013 and concerns rising about the NHS's ability to withstand a cash squeeze, rising demand and a fundamental reorganisation all at the same time, Porter's low profile will not last long.</p> <p>As the voice of the doctors' union, which has 140,000 members, Porter, a 50-year-old consultant anaesthetist in Coventry, faces two main challenges.</p> <p>First, he has to somehow extract some concessions on pensions from a government that has played hard ball on the issue. Doctors, he says, \"remain hugely upset\" at ministers' \"arbitrary\" decision to push through big changes to an NHS pension scheme that generates a \u00a32bn annual surplus and was reworked in 2008 to make it sustainable.</p> <p>Second, he has to win a battle for the hearts and minds of the public against the health secretary, Andrew Lansley that will only increase in intensity until the next election in 2015.</p> <p>The growing pressures on the NHS, its unique place in British life and its significance to all three main parties' prospects in 2015 mean the public will be able to choose between the very different Porter and Lansley visions. Neither claims the NHS is in a crisis. Both agree the NHS in England is doing surprisingly well given that more people are seeking its services just when it is facing flat budgets after the long years of Labour largesse, the job of delivering \u00a320bn of efficiency savings by 2015 and the upheaval of yet another restructuring.</p> <p>Lansley paints an optimistic picture of stable waiting times, patients' greater choice of where to have treatment driving overdue improvements in quality of care, and groups of GPs taking charge of commissioning \u00a360bn of healthcare from next April \u2013 the centrepiece of his reforms \u2013 benefiting doctors and patients. In his view, the bill was painful medicine the NHS had to swallow in order to help it provide better value for money, give patients greater control and use competition to drive up standards. Porter, by contrast, is worried. He fears that what he repeatedly calls the NHS's founding principle of \"social solidarity\", the concept of it as \"good for society [and] a comfort and security for society\", is being eroded by a combination of growing rationing of treatment, greater use of competition, more and more NHS services being provided by private firms and the service's struggle with the biggest cash squeeze in recent history.</p> <p>The imminent requirement for \"any qualified provider\" to be allowed to provide services such as physiotherapy and children's wheelchairs will threaten the future of existing NHS services and enable firms such as Virgin Care to make further inroads into the NHS's \u00a3110bn budget. Porter worries that an NHS run for 64 years on the basis of \"social solidarity\" is being replaced by one which is \"a series of transactions rather than a service that holds together\". He asks, why deliberately create a market in health services in an area when none currently exists?</p> <p>As he sips a Diet Coke in his office on the third floor of the BMA's grand headquarters near Euston station in London, Porter draws a series of ideological faultlines with coalition policy. Greater competition is not just unwelcome \u2013 the BMA wants to retain an NHS that is both publicly-funded and publicly-provided \u2013 but also \"unnecessary because there's no particular evidence that having a system which is pluralist \u2013 part-private \u2013 is necessarily better.\" Forsaking the principle of social solidarity would mean that \"you end up in a system like the United States, which many British doctors look at with a degree of trepidation\".</p> <p>That is a dramatic, arguably fanciful, comparison from a man who rarely seems to lend himself to florid, exaggerated prose. The UK and America's health systems could not be more different. Porter's argument is that, if certain damaging policies are allowed to continue, the NHS could end up resembling its counterpart across the Atlantic, where access to healthcare is not universal, citizens cannot necessarily access every kind of treatment and where charges creep in.</p> <p>Denying patients access to operations or drugs their GP believes would benefit them means that already \"there's lots of areas where bits of the NHS have been taken out of the offer [and] it's no longer a comprehensive service\", he says. Taking aim at ministers' repeated professed aim of maintaining the NHS, this passionate advocate of the health service adds that despite its constitution guaranteeing comprehensive, universal healthcare \"the idea of social solidarity is gradually being chipped away at, by the actual actions which are said to be supporting the continued existence of the NHS.</p> <p>\"The BMA is not blessed of a special forecasting ability. But we are made up of most doctors who work in the NHS, which is how we see what's happening. It's not that [the BMA believes] the entire system's going to fall over in a few months. But it's quite apparent that the nature of the offer to the public is changing and the pace of change is picking up under the dual impact of the current reforms and the spending restrictions.\"</p> <p>Porter was born into a working class, Newcastle-under-Lyme family in 1962 and was the first member of his family to go to university \u2013 \"like Neil Kinnock\".</p> <p>He is fond of quoting Labour veteran Denis Healey's dictum that every politician needs a hinterland. His, according to BMA News, includes \"a love of classical history, particularly that of the Roman empire, science fiction and political dramas\". The last of those should stand him in good stead for the inevitable tussles ahead.</p>",
  "<p>An athlete selected to represent Great Britain in weightlifting at the Paralympics was banned from the Games hours before he was due to join his team-mates in London after the Home Office refused him security clearance.</p> <p>Paul Efayena, from Peckham, south London, who had been due to compete in the powerlifting 100kg category, had previously been given a nine-year sentence for grievous bodily harm. He had declared his conviction, had the support of the ParalympicsGB team and had previously represented GB, twice in the UK and in Malaysia and Dubai.</p> <p>The Home Office approved an initial recommendation by his probation officer for him to apply to join the team but appeared to make a U-turn, forcing ParalympicsGB to tell Efayena it had lost a last-ditch appeal to accredit him.</p> <p>ParalympicsGB is backing Efayena, saying it is disappointed with the decision and looks forward to working with him in Rio in 2016.</p> <p>Efayena was released from prison in March 2011. Three months later, he was in a motorcycle accident which resulted in him losing a leg. He left hospital a month later and had a meeting with officials from the British weightlifting team, who invited him to apply to join. The application was supported by Efayena's probation officer, who supervised his licence conditions, and Efayena started training with the British team.</p> <p>Since his release, he has spoken regularly to young people on the dangers of being involved with crime. He also visits homeless shelters and hostels.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Efayena reported to the weightlifting training camp in Bath and was issued with a uniform. He was due to join his team-mates last Monday but he received a phone call on Sunday from ParalympicsGB asking him to report to its headquarters in London. There, he was told his accreditation to participate in the games had been withdrawn due to security concerns.</p> <p>Efayena said he was bitterly disappointed with his rejection after the \"amazing news\" of being selected and could not understand why the Home Office \"left it until I was practically in the village before they said no\".</p> <p>A spokesman for ParalympicsGB said it had asked for the decision to be reviewed, but had been told the original decision stood.</p> <p>He said it was disappointed with the outcome: \"We consider Paul to be an ongoing prospect for the sport and look forward to working with him and his sport in the Rio 2016 cycle.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said background checks were carried out on behalf of the London organising committee and the athlete failed the checks.</p>",

Certainly little that Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan said lingers in the memory.</p> <p>Two moments, though, stand out. One was the extraordinarily moving tribute paid to Mitt Romney by <a href=\"http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/08/30/video-transcript-pam-finlaysons-emotional-rnc-speech/#more-94348\">Pamela Finlayson</a>, one of his parishioners in Massachusetts. She described how the Romneys helped her family as they struggled with their premature daughter, and 26 years later were still caring. I'd have voted for Mitt if the election had been held when Finlayson finished speaking.</p> <p>The other was the powerful keynote <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80421.html\">addresses</a> by two governors, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Haley's speech was the most accomplished of the convention, but Martinez's exhibited a quiet confidence that singles her out as a future party leader. \"As the first Hispanic female governor in history, little girls often come up to me in the grocery store or the mall,\" said Martinez. \"They look and point, and when they get the courage, they ask 'Are you Susana?' and they run up and give me a hug. And I wonder: how do you know who I am?\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815801\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Ana Marie Cox:</strong> My favorite convention moment was actually one of the most ordinary: I had a conversation with someone. Looking for women to talk about the GOP platform with, I found a lady who was a senior-citizen black alternate delegate from Nebraska. She single-handedly embodied half of the contradictions at the center of the 2012 contest, including the fact that she was utterly gracious and willing to spend quite a bit of time talking very reasonably about issues many want to avoid. We talked about abortion, about broken families, even about Ron Paul. After a week of being reminded at every turn of the anger at the heart of the Republican message, I hope I can keep in mind the potential for real conversation once we meet each other face-to-face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815802\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/19/1334856266547/Adam-Gabbatt-byline-pic-003.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Gabbatt byline pic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Gabbatt byline pic.

These are people under 29, well educated, who believe in the Republican core of small government and lower taxes. They just happen to be homosexual.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that means that outside of groups like the Log Cabin Republicans, there isn't much of a place for them within the modern GOP. It was interesting to hear the people I spoke to put forward the idea that Republicans, as individual freedom champions, shouldn't give two hoots about what goes on behind closed doors between consenting adults. Unfortunately, the party is in such a thrall to the rightwing, God fearing base, that change is unlikely from a top down level any time soon - and while you have someone like Rick Santorum trotting around the country comparing gay sex to \"man on dog\", Republicans are unlikely to attract the kind of socially liberal members who could effect change at a grass roots level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815803\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/ewen_macaskill_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Ewen Macaskill\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Ewen MacAskill:</strong> There are two main contenders for moment of the week at the Republican convention: Clint Eastwood's meltdown on stage, and the star turn by former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>Eastwood, though an actor, offered up a rambling, at times almost incoherent, speech. He was the 'mystery guest', the element of surprise. When he took to the stage at first, it seemed to work, his appearance dramatic, against a screen backdrop of one his most popular roles The Man With No Name. Although he was cheered throughout by convention delegate at the time, the postmortem was less charitable. He ran well over his alloted slot, throwing out the schedule, meaning Mitt Romney overshot his primetime television slot.</p> <p>Rice, though well known as a speaker at foreign policy thinktanks, was not generally regarded as a politician. She was seen as primarily academic. Along with Florida senator Marco Rubio, she turned in one of the best performances of the week. She brought to life what had until that point been a listless convention, at which delegates had been milling around, barely listening to the speakers. Her best line was that she was able to rise from segregated Alabama, unable to eat a hamburger in a Woolworth store, to become secretary of state. And one day president, perhaps?<br></p> <p><strong>MaribelleFL:</strong> I will remember Marco Rubio's speech the most. Truly the best speech. The best part ...</p> <blockquote> <p>Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person. By all accounts, he too is a good husband, and a good father \u2014 and thanks to lots of practice, a pretty good golfer. Our problem is he's a bad president.</p> <p>The new slogan for the president's campaign is \"Forward.\" A government that spends $1 trillion more than it takes in. An $800 billion stimulus that created more debt than jobs. A government intervention into health care paid for with higher taxes and cuts to Medicare. Scores of new rules and regulations.</p> <p>These ideas don't move us 'Forward', they take us backwards. These are tired and old big government ideas. Ideas that people come to America to get away from. Ideas that threaten to make America more like the rest of the world, instead of helping the world become more like America.</p> <p>Under Barack Obama, the only \"Change\" is that \"Hope\" has been hard to find.<br>Now millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us by reminding us of what makes us special, he divides us against each other. He tells Americans they're worse off because others are better off. That people got rich by making others poor. Hope and Change has become Divide and Conquer.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>TheBonsaiKid:</strong> The moment Mitt Romney said \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet.\" pulling a silly face and enjoying the laughs.</p> <p>The very idea of climate change dismissed as a joke unworthy of even commenting on. It just seemed to embody the detachment from reality of the whole shebang.</p> <p><strong>sbanicki: </strong>Here is what Barack Obama and the Democrats need to do at next weeks convention. They need to explain the contrast between the Democratic parties platform and the platform revealed by the Republicans last week. While doing this, major falsehoods expressed by Republicans must be addressed.</p> <p>Obama must debunk the fallacy that the country is worse off than it was four years ago. The events causing the collapse of housing and stock markets did not happen in the fall of 2008. The fall of 2008 was when the market, and thus the country, acknowledged the devastation of home values brought about by sub-prime lending throughout the first eight years of this century.</p> <p>In the normal course of banking and finance, holders of financial assets are required to establish a reserve for losses against assets acquired. When a bank makes a car loan they immediately set up a loss reserve. No lender expects a specific loan to default on the day the loan is made. However, an experienced lender knows that a certain percentage of loans made will end up in default. He just does not know which specific loans will fail.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Over to you!

  "<p>A woman who has lived in an abandoned Welsh hillside cottage for 11 years is to challenge legislation that criminalises squatting.</p> <p>Irene Gardiner, 49, raised her family in the 500-year-old timber and stone house at Newchapel, near Llanidloes, Powys.</p> <p>Backed by lawyers in London, Gardiner is bringing a test case against the police and Crown Prosecution Service seeking assurances she will not be thrown out of the home she has inhabited since 2001.</p> <p>Her cottage, which has no electricity or running water, has been occupied by squatters for several decades.</p> <p>Last year Gardiner, who works as a puppeteer, jeweller and for circuses, tried to claim lawful possession of the property but her application failed.</p> <p>The legislation comes into force on Saturday and exposes her and her children to the immediate threat of prosecution. Under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/144/enacted\" title=\"S.144 Legal Aid Act\">section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act</a>, squatting in residential premises becomes punishable by up to six months' jail and fines up to \u00a35,000 in England and Wales.</p> <p>Like thousands of other squatters, she has been making last minute preparations in case there is a police raid \u2013 moving possessions to friends' homes.</p> <p>A significant proportion of the UK's estimated 20,000 squatters face a similar risk of criminal charges and removal from their temporary accommodation.</p> <p>The charity Crisis warned there could be a dramatic increase in street homelessness if police carry out a blitz on squats.</p> <p>Two of Gardiner's children, Hazel, 15, and Sol, 13, live with her and attend local schools. She pays her council tax.</p> <p>\"The property was vacant and abandoned when I moved in,\" she said.</p> <p>\"No one had title to it. I had been travelling around Europe in a bus and when I came back I had nowhere to live.</p> <p>\"Squatters who had stayed here suggested I move in. I've been here ever since, using candles and a generator.</p> <p>\"I'm self-employed and have never claimed housing benefit. I must have saved the government a fortune.</p> <p>\"I'm worried about what might happen now. I don't know how the police will apply the new law. I feel like it's my duty to take a test case. I have been squatting since I was 14. I have bought up four children.</p> <p>\"I have never left anywhere in a mess, never annoyed anybody. There's never been a problem. I would never squat in someone else's house. This law could make thousands of people homeless.\"</p> <p>Gardiner's case is supported by the law firm Leigh Day &amp; Co. The claim, to be lodged in the high court in London next week, alleges prosecution would breach her rights to personal and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p> <p>Ugo Hayter, of Leigh Day &amp; Co, said: \"This legislation will have impacts on the most vulnerable people in society, and will be a further burden on already strained public services.\"</p> <p>She added: \"There is existing criminal and civil law which enables property owners to swiftly evict squatters.</p> <p>\"Homeowners will derive no further protection from this new legislation. It will simply criminalise the homeless.\"</p> <p>Rosa Curling, a solicitor with the law firm, said: \"Ms Gardiner's circumstances are such that the application of Section 144 of the Act is totally disproportionate to the aim being pursued by the Secretary of State for Justice in introducing this piece of legislation.\"</p> <p>There are an estimated 720,000 empty residential properties in the UK. A report by <a href=\"http://www.squashcampaign.org/\" title=\"\">Squatters Action for Secure Homes</a> (Squash) claimed criminalising squatting could cost the government up to \u00a3790m over the next five years.</p> <p>But the justice minister Crispin Blunt told the BBC: \"We are spending \u00a3400m [over the next four years] on the homeless. Homelessness is at a 28-year low.</p> <p>\"We have a proper strategy for the homeless&#xa0;\u2026 that needs to sit alongside this measure, but this measure is about justice and fairness for homeowners who shouldn't have their homes stolen by squatters.\"</p> <p>The shadow justice minister Andy Slaughter said: \"The distress squatters can cause to families, as well as the financial damage they do, is completely unacceptable.\"</p> <p>David Salusbury, chairman of the National Landlords Association (NLA), said he was not convinced the law would have any discernible effect.</p> <p>\"The NLA would like to see landlords being able to automatically regain lawful possession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This new legislation will require the police to determine 'reasonable suspicion' in order to move quickly and remove a squatter.\"</p>",
  "<p>A New Jersey supermarket employee shot and killed two co-workers with an AK-47 assault rifle in the early hours of Friday before turning the gun on himself.</p> <p>Authorities say the 23-year-old man left a Pathmark in Old Bridge Township around 3.30am and returned a half-hour later with a handgun and the assault rifle, and wearing military clothing. </p> <p>Middlesex county prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said there were about 12 to 14 workers in the store. The man fired the rifle at the first workers he saw, killing an 18-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man as other workers hid, Kaplan said. \"I do not believe that they were specifically targeted. I believe everybody in the store was a target,\" said Kaplan.</p> <p>The gunman fired at least 16 rounds, some breaking the front windows. He then killed himself, said Kaplan, who did not release the name of the gunman or either victim.

Tyler, an infantryman, never served overseas, said Marine spokeswoman Captain Kendra Motz. She would not comment on the circumstances of his discharge.</p> <p>John Niccollai, president of a food workers union that represents some store employees, said Pathmark officials and employees told him the gunman wore military clothing and had just punched out for the night before coming back into the store and opening fire.</p> <p>Many of the employees escaped gunfire, Niccollai said, when an assistant manager, \"who I would view as a hero,\" helped many workers to get out of the store through the back door.</p> <p>Police at the scene were keeping onlookers well away from the store. A number of vehicles were in the parking lot outside, along with police vehicles.</p> <p>The store and its parking lot were closed.

  "<p>South Africa's government has in recent years taken to mimicking its apartheid predecessors, but nothing quite prepared most of us here for the decision on Thursday to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/south-african-miners-charged-murder\" title=\"\">charge 270 Lonmin miners</a> with the murder of their own colleagues through an obscure apartheid-era law.</p> <p>Fouteen days after 34 striking miners were mowed down by police gunfire in just three minutes at Lonmin's Marikana mine, the National Prosecuting Authority hauled out the \"common purpose\" doctrine \u2013 last used in 1989 against activists by an embattled apartheid government \u2013 to charge the 270 arrested mineworkers with the murder of their own colleagues.</p> <p>It is a decision that defies logic, spits at the ANC's own history of opposition to the doctrine, and has been received with incredulity across the political spectrum. So shocked are most South Africans that the minister of justice, Jeff Radebe, was forced to issue a statement on Friday asking for an explanation from the prosecutions chief.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt that the NPA's decision has induced a sense of shock, panic and confusion within the members of the community and the general South African public. It is therefore incumbent upon me to seek clarity on the basis upon which such a decision is taken,\" Radebe said.</p> <p>The charges are even more bizarre in light of an investigation published on Thursday by <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-08-30-the-murder-fields-of-marikana-the-cold-murder-fields-of-marikana\" title=\"\">Pulitzer prize-winning photographer Greg Marinovich</a> in which he claims that some of the mineworkers were shot in cold blood by police out of sight of journalists.</p> <p>\"It is becoming clear to this reporter that heavily armed police hunted down and killed the miners in cold blood. A minority were killed in the filmed event (in which) police claim they acted in self-defence. The rest was murder on a massive scale,\" he wrote.</p> <p>The last time the \"common purpose\" doctrine was used was in 1989 when a grouping dubbed the \"Upington 14\" was sentenced to hang for the killing of a black police constable by a crowd of about 500.</p> <p>Evelina de Bruin, a grandmother, spent two years awaiting the gallows despite the fact that there was no evidence that she had even touched the dead policeman. The ANC campaigned for her release then and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/30/world/pretoria-overturns-death-sentences-for-14.html\" title=\"\">her conviction was overturned in 1991</a>. She died in March this year.</p> <p>The decision to use this doctrine today seems to ignore the facts of the Upington 14 case. In overturning de Bruin's conviction, South Africa's appeal court ruled in 1991 that a crowd could not have an intention to kill, only individuals could. It said that to be found guilty of murder beyond possible doubt, an intention to kill had to be demonstrated in the case of each individual.</p> <p>At the moment the state cannot even verify the miners' addresses, let alone fit all of them into a court of law. It essentially does not even know them, yet incredibly, the state purports to know that each and every one of the 270 miners intended to get their own colleagues killed.</p> <p>The common purpose doctrine was used in the 1980s by a regime that could not investigate or police its own people. Instead, it used a heinous blanket law to bully ordinary citizens and prevent them gathering and voicing their anger. Common purpose was the last throw of the dice of an illegitimate regime.</p> <p>The ANC still enjoys huge legitimacy in South Africa. The body that took the decision to use common purpose is not the ANC, but the supposedly independent national prosecuting authority. However, President Zuma is close to the woman who heads it up and this year inexplicably and controversially expunged her husband's criminal record. It seems that the separation between our politicians and independent institutions like the NPA is becoming extremely thin. Thursday's charges are yet another incident that has left many wondering whether the party \u2013 and the government it leads \u2013 have lost the plot.</p>",
  "<p>Unrest among South African miners has spread to the world's fourth biggest gold mine.</p> <p>Bullion miner Gold Fields said about a quarter of its 46,000 workers have walked out in the first strike to affect South Africa's gold mining industry since violent protest shut down London-listed Lonmin's platinum mine nearby three weeks ago.</p> <p>Gold Fields, which is listed in Johannesburg, said 12,000 miners have been on a \"unlawful and unprotected\" strike at the KDC mine near Johannesburg since Wednesday.</p> <p>The KDC mine produced 1.1m troy ounces of gold in the year ending December 2011.

  "<p>David Cameron must ignore some of his Tory colleagues and listen to Lord Justice Leveson when the judge outlines reforms to the regulation of the press, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats has said.</p> <p>In the wake of a Times report on Friday that the prime minister is planning to give the industry another chance to improve self-regulation, Simon Hughes said that a series of scandals had shown this system has failed.</p> <p>Hughes, who received damages from News International earlier this year after his phoned was hacked by the News of the World, said: \"David Cameron would do well to ignore the calls from some in his party who for far too long have been far too close to media owners and instead listen to the judge that he appointed to look into these matters in detail. After everything we know now, the public will simply not accept the failure of this government to finally sort out this issue, which successive governments have failed to sort out before.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dem deputy leader, who accused the News of the World of \"criminal behaviour on an industrial scale\" when he settled his civil case in the high court earlier this year, spoke out after the Times reported that Cameron is preparing to reject statutory intervention in the regulation of the press.</p> <p>Sources have confirmed that the prime minister \"broadly\" believes the industry should be give another chance to improve self-regulation by making further concessions to show that the new system is genuinely independent and, critically, with editors banned from being involved in adjudications on complaints.</p> <p>However, this does not have the support of the Lib Dems, who believe self-regulation has failed.</p> <p>Hughes said the state should never regulate the content of newspapers but that new systems needed to be put in place to guard against repeat lapses in standards in the press, such as the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>\"The scandals which have been hugely damaging to the press in our country should demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that the system of self-regulation has failed,\" he added. \"Nobody is arguing that the state should ever regulate the content of newspapers but there is a strong case for a new system which will require newspapers to have the systems in place which will prevent widespread criminal behaviour and unacceptable breaches of privacy from happening again.\"</p> <p>Cameron <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/evidence/?witness=david-cameron-mp\" title=\"\">told Leveson during his testimony</a> that the future press watchdog \"can't be self-regulation, it has to be independent regulation\". But he strongly hinted he did not support full statutory regulation.</p> <p>\"It would be much better if we could deliver it without statute,\" he said, adding that the test of the new press regulator would be whether it worked for people like the parents of Milly Dowler and Madeleine McCann.</p> <p>\"The test of a regulatory system is not: does that make the politicians happier? The test of the system is: is it going to provide proper protection to ordinary families who, through no fault of their own, get caught up in these media maelstroms and get completely mistreated?\" he said.</p> <p>Lord Black, the chairman of Presbof, which funds the discredited Press Complaints Commission, is believed to be playing a pivotal behind-the-scenes role. He is also a former PCC director.</p> <p>He is close to Cameron and is co-ordinating the industry's response to Leveson, including proposed new powers of investigation and fines of up to \u00a31m for breaches of strict codes of conduct on a range of issues from privacy to accuracy.</p> <p>\"Statutory regulation of the written word would be an unacceptable impingement on press freedom,\" Black said in his submission to the inquiry. He told Leveson during oral evidence that any attempt to introduce new laws to govern newspapers would run the risk of getting \"stuck in parliamentary aspic\".</p> <p>Black also warned that a statutory system would face \"constant legal challenge to the legal decisions of a regulator\" by newspapers.</p> <p>The prime minister made clear in his evidence to the Leveson inquiry that he was wary of statutory regulation when he spoke of the dangers of \"excessive\" regulation.</p> <p>In his statement to the inquiry, he said: \"In my view, more effective regulation, independent of government, is a better option. I do not believe that direct regulation by the government or a government-appointed body would be appropriate as it would damage our democracy, inhibit a free press and indeed, it could erode the benefits of the media holding politicians to account and uncovering wrongdoing amongst politicians.\"</p> <p>The behind-the-scenes machinations come at a sensitive time. Leveson is still working on his final report and recommendations and nobody wants to be seen publicaly to pre-empt this.</p> <p>He has already expressed his \"disappointment\" that a confidential letter he sent to newspaper groups warning of potential criticism in his final report is being discussed by the press.</p> <p>He made his disapproval known after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/29/leveson-letter-press-chris-blackhurst\" title=\"\">Chris Blackhurst, the editor of the Independent,</a> went on Radio 4's The Media Show on Wednesday and claimed that Leveson was \"loading a gun\" for the newspaper industry and that his warning letter, which was sent to all main newspaper groups, was a \"point by point demolition\" of the press.</p> <p>Blackhurst said that Leveson was throwing the book at the industry and had failed to acknowledge that newspapers, not others, had uncovered scandal after scandal.</p> <p>His remarks prompted the Leveson inquiry to issue a statement on Wednesday pointing out it was legally obliged under inquiries legislation to give anyone who will be criticised in his final report written warning of that potential criticism to give them an opportunity to respond to it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/29/leveson-letter-press-chris-blackhurst\" title=\"\">The statement also said comments on his letter were a \"misrepresentation\"</a> of the facts and that by their nature such letters were one-sided.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Spain will inject emergency capital into the country's biggest ailing bank, Bankia, as it puts into place reforms to allow loss-making banks to receive eurozone bailout money.</p> <p>The move came after Bankia admitted losing more than \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.168bn) in the first half year and as the conservative government of prime minister Mariano Rajoy delayed a decision on losses to be absorbed by small investors in bailed out banks.</p> <p>The Fund for the Orderly Bank Restructuring (Frob) said Bankia's restructuring plan should be ready by October, allowing eurozone rescue money to arrive in November. \"While the restructuring process is completed, the Frob intends to inject capital shortly,\" it said. This would be an advance on the eurozone money.</p> <p>The Spanish government passed an ambitious banking law on Friday pledging once more that this would be the definitive shakeup for its finance sector that needs up to a \u20ac100bn (\u00a380bn) bailout.</p> <p>\"This brings reform of the finance system to its crowning point,\" the deputy prime minister, Soraya Saenz de Santamar\u00eda, said as the government presented its third reform in six months.</p> <p>A so-called \"bad bank\" will swallow large amounts of the toxic real estate that has brought down several Spanish banks and threatens several more. The property is left over from the housing construction bubble that burst in 2008, just as the credit crunch happened, and which lies at the root of Spain's double-dip recession and 25% unemployment.</p> <p>The bad bank will receive building plots, unfinished developments and possibly tens of thousands of unsold homes from developers who went bust or are struggling to repay loans. It will be expected to sell this stock at a profit over the next 10 to 15 years. \"It will be viable and will not post losses,\" the finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said.</p> <p>The creation of the bad bank \u2013 which the government hoped would be mostly privately financed \u2013 was one of the demands made by the eurozone countries providing the \u20ac100bn loan facility to Spain's banks.</p> <p>The law also creates a process for breaking up and winding down banks, while ensuring that small savers who invested widely in risky preference shares in banks would bear some of the losses when they are bailed out.</p> <p>The decision to use the Frob to inject capital into Bankia rather than an emergency facility set aside by the eurozone rescue fund, came as the finance ministry failed to give full details of what losses would be born by shareholders and small investors who bought hybrid preference shares in banks that receive eurozone money. Those losses may now not be made public until after regional elections in Galicia and the Basque country in October.</p> <p>De Guindos did not say what price the bad bank would pay for toxic assets, but promised a transparent system. This should be in place by December.</p> <p>\"The reform is a step in the right direction, but there is still much to do,\" said Carlos Vergara, of the IESE business school, pointing to doubts about the price the bad bank will pay for toxic assets and the names of those banks that are not considered viable.</p> <p>\"The key is at what price these assets are bought,\" agreed Jordi Fabregat of the Esade business school. \"If it is too high, then the Spanish people will end up paying for it.\"</p> <p>De Guindos said the two rounds of provisioning ordered earlier this year should ease the process of setting a price as some of the worst assets, such as building land, are now provisioned at 80%.</p> <p>Spain's banks have an estimated \u20ac184bn in toxic real-estate loans and investments, but only some will go to the bad bank.</p> <p>The law also raised core capital requirements \u2013 the level of high-quality assets banks must to hold to protect them against economic shocks \u2013 to 9%.</p> <p>With the economy shrinking at 1.3% a year, Spain is struggling to convince markets it can avoid a full government bailout.</p> <p>Money continues to leave the country, with the Bank of Spain reporting on Friday a net capital outflow for the first six months of 2012 of \u20ac220bn, against a \u20ac22bn inflow for the same period last year.</p> <p>Spanish bond yields crept up to 6.9% on Friday, just below the 7% level seen as unsustainable for sovereign borrowing costs. The crisis in Spain's regional governments was also underlined when credit agency S&amp;P cut debt-ridden Catalonia's rating to junk.</p>",

Listen here<br></a><br><strong>Hometown:</strong> Jacksonville, Florida.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Yuno (vocals, music).</p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>Some of the best songs this summer have been songs about summer, or rather songs imbued with the creeping feeling of nostalgia that occurs towards the end of August when you realise summer is almost over. We're thinking of the breathtakingly sorrowful <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpF_ggHKSdg\" title=\"\">Think About the Days</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHbKUyq5m_w\" title=\"\">Summer's Gone</a> from the recent Beach Boys comeback album, and we're thinking about Sunlight by Florida bedroom laptop boy wonder Yuno.</p> <p>His debut single as Yuno, Sunlight is three minutes and 33 seconds of shimmering indie-pop perfection, all tremulous guitar, bolstering bass and hazy, lazy vocals. In terms of chord structure and use of reverb, echo and delay, it's in the Vaccines ballpark, but it's way more layered and lovely than anything on their new album. The yearning in Yuno's voice is intoxicating and intrinsic to an appreciation of the work, even if it's more about what's implied than said. \"I'll be around, soon as I leave this town,\" he sings, and either we're hearing things or it's the soft sound of someone going quietly out of their mind with unfulfilled desire. \"And time is moving slow, as your hair starts to grow/ I'll be with you sometime alone in the sunlight,\" he goes on, virtually expiring with longing. Sunlight is the apotheosis of that whole surf-pop-goes-miserablist approach invented by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/sep/15/new-band-the-drums\" title=\"\">the Drums</a>. It's the single of the late summer, of a sad teen's endless bummer.</p> <p>It isn't the first thing we've heard by Yuno. In fact, we wrote about him last year when he was making music as the rather less pronounceable <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/18/new-band-unouomedude\" title=\"\">Unouomedude</a>. He makes a reappearance here on the grounds that a) he's assumed a new guise even if we're not exactly talking <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-ChangesOneBowie/release/2897574\" title=\"\">Changesoneyuno</a>; b) he has somewhat \u2013 but not drastically \u2013 changed musical direction, or at least smoothed away the rough edges to achieve something within blinking distance of the divine; and c) he is trying really hard to find ways to bring you his music and the music, as we've said, is so fine it deserves some support.</p> <p>Basically, he wants your money. And so if you go to <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> you can pledge a sum that will go towards the recording of his album, V, and help take the Yuno show on the road. The resourceful 19-year-old has already received the $2,000 he needed for a guitar amp, effects pedals, instrument upgrades/repairs, instrument cables, cases, accessories, and new instruments with which to record and tour. His next goal is to reach $4,500, which will enable him to \"fully realise my ideas for V and other future releases\". He adds: \"I have a lot of musical ideas, but I don't have the equipment to make all of the pretty sounds that are floating around in my head. Things like a more powerful computer, a better microphone, more instruments, studio monitors, and a better audio interface will allow me to make the sounds that I want to make, without all of my current limitations.\"</p> <p>Sound fair enough? To put things in perspective, Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy is alleged to have cost somewhere between $8-13m to produce. Fact: Sunlight is worth more than anything on Chinese Democracy. Plus, you get a free EP and a mixtape called CROUD \u2013 so-called because it features Covers, Rare, Old, Unreleased and Demos \u2013 if you become a backer. What price art? We've already pledged because, frankly, we wanted that EP, to check whether there were any other songs on there of the dolorous calibre of Sunlight. There weren't, but we're still optimistic, unlike the protagonist of the single of the late summer.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The perfect end of summer anthem\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.prefixmag.com/media/yuno/sunlight/68054/\" title=\"\">prefixmag.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> You owe us, dude.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Start spending.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to: </strong>Start kicking.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Once he gets \"Kickstarted\", there will be an EP and an album to follow in 2013.</p> <p><strong>File next to: </strong>Unouomedude, the Drums, the Wake, Oberhofer.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1174761329/yuno-is-making-a-record\" title=\"\">kickstarter.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Monday's new band: </strong>Dominic Lord.</p>",
  "<p>A little-known power enjoyed by the Queen and Prince of Wales to alter new laws is due to be exposed after the government lost a legal battle to keep details of its application private.</p> <p>The information commissioner has ruled that the Cabinet Office must publish an internal Whitehall guide to the way the senior royals are consulted before legislation is introduced to ensure it does not harm their private interests.</p> <p>The application of the controversial veto was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/30/prince-charles-offered-veto-legislation\" title=\"\">revealed by the Guardian</a> last year and has been described by constitutional lawyers as \"a royal nuclear deterrent\". Some believe it may underpin the influence Prince Charles appears to wield in Whitehall over pet issues ranging from architecture to healthcare.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2012/aug/31/ruling-royal-veto-guidelines\" title=\"\">A judgment issued last week</a> by the deputy information commissioner, Graham Smith, means the Cabinet Office has until 25 September to release the confidential internal manual. It details how the consent of \"The Crown and The Duchy of Cornwall\" is obtained before bills are passed into law and what criteria ministers apply before asking the royals to amend draft laws. If it fails to do so it could face high court action.</p> <p>In the past two parliamentary sessions Charles has been asked to consent to at least 12 draft bills on everything from wreck removals to co-operative societies. Between 2007 and 2009 he was consulted on bills relating to coroners, economic development and construction, marine and coastal access, housing and regeneration, energy and planning. In Charles's case, the little-known power stems from his role as the head of the \u00a3700m Duchy of Cornwall estate, which provides his \u00a317m-a-year private income.</p> <p>The government battled to keep the manual secret, claiming publication would breach legal professional privilege, and a spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said it was still deciding whether to challenge the ruling at the information tribunal.</p> <p>Lord Berkeley, a Labour peer who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2011/oct/30/letter-marine-navigation-bill?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">told to seek Charles's consent</a> on a marine navigation bill, said the commissioner's decision was \"absolutely right\". He said publication could shed light on a little-known procedure that allows the prince and the Queen \"to fiddle around with bills to make sure they don't affect their private interests\".</p> <p>\"People will start thinking, what the hell is going on?\" he said. \"We are in the 21st century, not the 18th century and it is crazy to think they are even trying to do this. The royal family should give up this special privilege and we should all obey the law of the land. Just because they have private estates, private incomes and land from several centuries ago doesn't mean they should have the right to interfere.\"</p> <p>The latest crack in the edifice of secrecy around Charles's influence on public life came after a legal scholar, John Kirkhope, asked for Whitehall's internal manuals on consulting the royals. He said it was \"clearly in the public interest that citizens understand how laws are made and applied as well as the circumstances in which the Duchy of Cornwall is consulted\".</p> <p>Kirkhope was researching a university thesis about the legal status of the duchy and wanted to know how ministers decided whether new laws affected the \"hereditary revenues, personal property of the Duke [Charles] or other interests\".</p> <p>The Duchy of Cornwall runs farms and industrial property, builds houses and acts as a landlord as well as taking responsibility for large areas of the natural environment in south-west England. Its interests often overlap with Charles's own in areas such as town planning where past interventions in public debate have seen the prince accused of abusing his influence to distort the democratic process.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/25/chelsea-barracks-trial-prince-charles\" title=\"\">In 2009 Charles caused a storm</a> when he stepped into the public planning debate for the Chelsea Barracks housing development designed by Richard Rogers. He privately complained to the site's owner, the prime minister of Qatar, that the design was \"a gigantic experiment with the very soul of our capital city\". Rogers was promptly sacked and the scheme redrawn in line with the prince's tastes.</p> <p>Kirkhope said evidence he had gathered suggested the process of seeking royal consent for draft bills was not a mere formality. \"The correspondence indicates that the effects of the bills are explained to the royal household, including the Duchy of Cornwall, discussions ensue and if necessary changes are made to proposed legislation,\" he said. \"Departments of state have fought to avoid releasing correspondence which gives some hint of how the process works and the Cabinet Office has resisted releasing details of the guidance which determines whether the prince as Duke of Cornwall is consulted in the first place.</p> <p>\"As a citizen of this country I have a proper interest in ensuring the process by which laws are made should be transparent and that those who are given special privileges should be accountable. That is demonstrably not the case with regard to the Duchy of Cornwall.\"</p> <p>Earlier in August Kirkhope forced the government to release edited emails showing how the Ministry of Justice consulted Buckingham Palace in 2008 and 2009 over the detail of the apprenticeships bill and how it would affect the Queen \"in her personal capacity\". As an employer of 1,200 staff the royal household stood to be affected, along with thousands of other employers. The civil servants wanted to know \"Her Majesty's intentions in relation to the bill\" before its second reading in the House of Commons.</p> <p>One email refers to a note from the Queen's solicitors, Farrer and Co, \"setting out his instructions in relation to the application of the apprenticeships bill to Her Majesty in her personal capacity\".</p> <p>The official states: \"I understand from our discussion today that it might not be possible for what they want to happen without there being express provision in the bill\".</p> <p>It echoes correspondence released last year in which a minister wrote to the prince's office requesting his consent to a new planning bill because it was \"capable of applying to ... [the] Prince of Wales' private interests\".</p> <p>Buckingham Palace and Clarence House released a joint statement in response to the information commissioner's ruling. \"The royal household understands that the Cabinet Office is considering the information commissioner's decision and next step,\" it said. \"It would not be a matter for the royal household to challenge any decision.\"</p>",

  "<h2>Archery</h2> <p><strong>ARW 1:</strong> Archers in this sport class compete in a wheelchair because their impairment includes the loss of leg and trunk function. Also, their arms show a loss of muscle strength, co-ordination or range of movement.</p> <p><strong>ARW 2:</strong> Similar to archers in the sport class ARW1, archers in this sport class have a strong activity limitation in their trunk and legs and compete in a wheelchair. Their arms, however, show full function.</p> <p><strong>ARST:</strong> This sport class includes athletes competing in a standing position and those who require some standing support because of poor balance. They either have a leg-length difference, limb deficiency or impairments that also affect their arms and trunk.</p> <h2>Athletics</h2> <p>In athletics, the sport classes consist of a prefix <strong>T</strong> (for track) or <strong>F</strong> (for field) and a number.</p> <p><strong>T/F11-13:</strong> Visual impairment. The three sport classes 11, 12 and 13 are allocated to athletes with varying degrees of visual impairment, with sport class 11 indicating athletes with the lowest vision. All athletes in the <strong>T11</strong> sport class run with a guide runner and are blindfolded. Athletes in sport class <strong>T12</strong> may also choose to run with a guide.</p> <p><strong>T/F 20:</strong> Intellectual impairment. Athletes in this class are diagnosed with intellectual impairment and meet sport-specific minimum disability criteria in 1,500m, long jump or shot put respectively. Athletes with an intellectual impairment are limited in regards to intellectual functions and their adaptive behaviour, which is diagnosed before the age of 18 years.</p> <p><strong>T32-38</strong> and <strong>F31-38:</strong> The 30s sport classes are allocated to athletes with athetosis, ataxia and/or hypertonia. The impairments typically affect the ability to control legs, trunk, arms and hands. The lower the number is, the more significant the activity limitation. Athletes in the sport classes <strong>31-34</strong> compete in a seated position; those in the sport classes <strong>35-38</strong> show a better function compete standing.</p> <p><strong>F40:</strong> Athletes with short stature compete in this sport class.</p> <p><strong>T/F42-46:</strong> These sport classes are designated for athletes with limb deficiencies. In the sport classes <strong>42-44</strong> the legs are affected, and in the sport classes <strong>45-46</strong> the arms are affected. All athletes compete standing.</p> <p><strong>T51-54</strong> and <strong>F51-58:</strong> The 50s sport classes only include athletes competing in a wheelchair, with a lower number indicating a higher activity limitation. Athletes in classes <strong>T51-52</strong> have activity limitations in both lower and upper limbs. Unlike athletes in the sport classes T51-53, athletes competing in <strong>T54</strong> have partial trunk and leg function.</p> <p>For field events, the groups are more differentiated. Athletes in sport classes <strong>F51-54</strong> have limited shoulder, arm and hand functions and no trunk or leg function. Athletes in the class <strong>F54</strong> have full function in their arms and hands. Trunk and leg function increases through sport classes <strong>F55-58</strong>.</p> <h2>Boccia</h2> <p>All players compete in wheelchairs due to a loss of leg function and trunk stability, caused by a lack of muscle co-ordination and control.</p> <p><strong>BC1:</strong> Athletes have severe activity limitations affecting their legs, arms and trunk due to co-ordination impairments. They can grasp and throw the ball and do not use assistive devices. Athletes with some leg control are allowed to propel the ball with their foot.</p> <p><strong>BC2:</strong> Players have better trunk control and arm function than the players in the BC1 and BC3 sport class. The abilities of their arms and hands often allow them to throw the ball overhand and underhand and with a variety of grasps.</p> <p><strong>BC3:</strong> Athletes competing in this class have a significantly limited function in their arms and legs and poor or no trunk control due to cerebral or non-cerebral origin. Unlike BC1 players, they use a ramp to roll the ball as they are unable to propel the ball into court. Athletes often require assistive devices to propel the ball, because they cannot consistently grasp and throw the ball.</p> <p><strong>BC4:</strong> While the sport classes BC1-3 include athletes with impairments of cerebral origin, sport class BC4 comprises athletes with impairments that have no cerebral origin and that cause a loss of muscle strength or co-ordination. Players competing in this sport class have very poor leg and trunk function, but are able to grasp and throw the ball.</p> <h2>Cycling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395499738\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346421754245/Australias-Felicity-Johns-006.jpg\" alt=\"Australia's Felicity Johnson and Stephanie Morton in the women's individual B 1km cycling time trial\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Johnson and Stephanie Morton of Australia in the women's individual B 1km time trial qualification.

Athletes with visual impairment compete on tandems with a sighted \"pilot\".</p> <p><strong>Handcycle H1-4:</strong> Cyclists in the sport classes <strong>H1-3</strong> compete in a reclined position. Athletes in the <strong>H1</strong> class have a complete loss of trunk and leg function and have limited arm function, while athletes in the <strong>H3</strong> class have no leg function but good trunk and arm function. Cyclists in the <strong>H4</strong> sport class sit on their knees and can thus use their arms and trunk to accelerate the handcycle.</p> <p><strong>Tricycle T1-2:</strong> Due to impairment affecting their balance and co-ordination, tricycle athletes cannot ride a bicycle. <strong>T1</strong> is allocated to athletes with more significant co-ordination problems or loss of muscle power.</p> <p><strong>Biclycle C1-5:</strong> Athletes who are able to use a standard bicycle. <strong>C1</strong> is allocated to athletes with the most severe activity limitation, while <strong>C5</strong> is allocated to athletes who meet the minimum disability criteria.</p> <p><strong>Tandem TB:</strong> Cyclists with visual impairment race on a tandem with a sighted cyclist sitting in the front.</p> <h2>Equestrian</h2> <p><strong>Grade Ia:</strong> Riders have severe impairments of all limbs and poor trunk control.</p> <p><strong>Grade Ib:</strong> Riders have either severely reduced trunk control and minimally impaired upper limbs or moderate impairments of the upper and lower limbs and the trunk.</p> <p><strong>Grade II:</strong> Riders have a very limited ability in both lower limbs and a good trunk balance, or milder limitations in upper and lower limbs with reduced trunk control.</p> <p><strong>Grade III:</strong> Athletes are able to walk, but have a severe impairment in both arms or have no arms, a moderate impairment of all four limbs or short stature. This grade also includes athletes with no sight.</p> <p><strong>Grade IV:</strong> Riders with impaired range of motion or muscle strength, deficiency on one limb or mild deficiency on two limbs. Riders with reduced vision or a restricted visual field compete in this grade.</p> <h2>Football: five-a-side</h2> <p>All players are visually impaired. The players have a very low visual acuity or no light perception. During the game all players must wear eyeshades. In addition, each team has a sighted, able-bodied goalkeeper, who does not need to undergo classification.</p> <h2>Football: seven-a-side</h2> <p>Competing athletes have ataxia, hypertonia or athetosis, three impairment types that are most commonly associated with cerebral palsy. Players are allocated one of four sport classes described below. To ensure fairness, each team has to have one FT5 or FT6 player on the field at all times and is not allowed to have more than two FT8 players on the field.</p> <p><strong>FT 5:</strong> Players have limitation in both lower limbs and to some degree in both upper limbs. The players have difficulty running, turning and stopping because of a lack of lower limb control.</p> <p><strong>FT 6:</strong> Players are affected by co-ordination and balance problems in all four limbs and trunk. FT6 players typically have difficulties in dribbling the ball when running, acceleration and stopping.</p> <p><strong>FT7:</strong> This sport class is designated to hemiplegic players, meaning that only one side of their body is affected, causing the players to walk and run with a limp. On the impaired side, the athlete might have problems balancing, so that often the impaired leg is used to kick the ball.</p> <p><strong>FT8:</strong> This is this sport class describes the minimum impairment eligible for seven-a-side football. You may not see the impact of impairment when watching the athlete run or control the ball. However, involuntary muscle contractions and hesitation before explosive movements do constitute activity limitations in comparison to able-bodied players.</p> <h2>Goalball</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395499739\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2012/8/30/1346339590293/The-Brazilians-stop-a-sho-002.jpg\" alt=\"The Brazilians stop a shot during the Men's Group A Goalball match\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil v Finland at the Copper Box.

In order to ensure a fair competition between the teams, all players must wear eyeshades during the game.</p> <h2>Judo</h2> <p><strong>B1-3:</strong> Judoka all have visual impairment, with a lower number indicating a higher degree of impairment</p> <h2>Powerlifting</h2> <p>Powerlifting is open to athletes with physical impairments that have a certain severity impacting on sport performance. All athletes have an impairment in their lower limbs or hips, which would prohibit them from competing in able-bodied weightlifting. All eligible athletes compete in one sport class, which should not to be confused with the different weight categories.</p> <h2>Rowing</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395499740\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346422575212/Germanys-LTA-mixed-coxed--003.jpg\" alt=\"Germany's LTA mixed coxed four\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany's LTA mixed coxed four take part in heat one at Eton Dorney. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are three classes for athletes with physical impairment:</p> <p><strong>AS:</strong> Athletes primarily use their arms and shoulders to accelerate the boat, as they have minimal or no leg and trunk function.</p> <p><strong>TA:</strong> Athletes who can use their arms and trunk when rowing, but are not able to use their legs or a sliding seat when performing the strokes. These athletes typically have good trunk and arm function.</p> <p><strong>LTA-PD:</strong> Athletes who can use their legs, trunk and arms to accelerate the boat and can use the sliding seat.</p> <p>There are three sport classes for visual impairment:</p> <p><strong>LTA-VI B1, B2 and B3:</strong> Rowers in this sport class have varying degrees of visual impairment, with B1 being the most severe</p> <p>To ensure that races are fair, rowers compete only against those in the same sport class. Consequently, there are four different events:</p> <p><strong>AS Women's single sculls </strong></p> <p><strong>AS Men's single sculls</strong></p> <p><strong>LTA Mixed coxed four:</strong> Two male and two female rowers from the sport classes LTA-PD and LTA-B1/2/3 form a team. Due to their physical strength, only two rowers in the team may have a visual impairment, and no more than one may have the sport class LTA-VI B3. All athletes with visual impairment wear eyeshades during training and competition.</p> <p><strong>TA Mixed double sculls:</strong> One female and one male rower of sport class TA form a team.</p> <h2>Sailing</h2> <p>Sport classes are different for each competition format in sailing. Sailors compete in crews of three or two, or in a single-person boat.</p> <p><strong>Three-person keelboat:</strong> Sailors are classified with a sport class from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>7</strong>, with 7 indicating the least severe impairment. Athletes with visual impairment are also classified with the same sport classes. Depending on their visual ability, they compete in sport class <strong>3</strong>, <strong>5</strong> or <strong>7</strong>. To ensure fairness, each crew is allowed a maximum of 14 points.</p> <p><strong>Two-person keelboat:</strong> One sailor has to be allocated the sport class TPA and the other one has to be classified as TPB. <strong>TPA</strong> includes athletes with more severe impairments, which are equivalent to a sport class 1 or 2 on a three-person keelboat. <strong>TPB</strong> means that an athlete only has to meet the minimum impairment criteria for sailing. Athletes of all seven sport classes of the three-person keelboat could compete in the TPB sport class.</p> <p><strong>Single-person keelboat: </strong>Athletes only have to pass the minimum disability criteria, and there is no further sport class distinction. Equivalent to the TPB sport class on the two-person keelboat.</p> <h2>Shooting</h2> <p>There are two sport classes for athletes with physical impairments. All athletes eligible for shooting have an impairment of their lower limbs and most of them compete in a seated position.</p> <p><strong>SH1:</strong> Athletes shoot with either pistol or rifle. They do not require a shooting stand, because their arms are affected by impairment to a lesser extent and allow for sufficient support of the pistol or rifle.</p> <p><strong>SH2:</strong> Athletes with a more severe impairment in the upper limbs, which necessitates a shooting stand. Unlike the SH1 class, they shoot with rifles only and not pistols.</p> <h2>Sitting volleyball </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395499741\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346416739012/Martine-Wright-celebrates-006.jpg\" alt=\"Martine Wright celebrates a point with Victoria Widdup in their Paralympics match against Ukraine\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martine Wright (centre) celebrates a point with Victoria Widdup in their women's sitting volleyball match against Ukraine.

The impairment of athletes in sport class MD is generally less severe than the impairment of athletes competing in sport class D. To ensure a fair competition between two teams, a team may only have one MD player on the court, and all other five players must be allocated sport class D.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2> <p>The sport class names in swimming consist of a prefix <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SM</strong>, or <strong>SB</strong> and a number. The prefixes represent the stroke and the number indicates the sport class.</p> <p><strong>S</strong>: Freestyle, butterfly and backstroke</p> <p><strong>SM</strong>: Individual medley</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Breaststroke</p> <p><strong>1 -10:</strong> Physical impairment where a lower number indicates a more severe activity limitation. Athletes with different impairments compete against each other but the impact of their impairment on swim performance is similar.</p> <p><strong>11-13:</strong> Visual impairment, with 11 meaning a complete or nearly complete loss of sight and 13 describing the minimum eligible visual impairment. Athletes in sport class <strong>11</strong> compete with blackened goggles.</p> <p><strong>14:</strong> Swimmers with intellectual impairment who also meet the sport-specific criteria compete in this class.</p> <h2>Table tennis</h2> <p>Players with physical impairments compete in sport classes <strong>1-10</strong>, and athletes with an intellectual impairment compete in sport class <strong>11</strong>. Athletes in the sport classes <strong>1-5</strong> compete in a wheelchair and those in classes <strong>6-10</strong> compete in a standing position.</p> <h2>Wheelchair basketball </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395499742\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346424413652/Wheelchair-basketball-Gre-001.jpg\" alt=\"Wheelchair basketball: Great Britain v Germany\" width=\"220\" height=\"265\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Britain's Terry Bywater shoots for a basket under pressure from Germany's Dirk Passiwan at the North Greenwich Arena. Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Players are allocated one of eight sport classes from 1.0 to 4.5. Sport class 1.0 describes the most significant activity limitation. All athletes compete in a wheelchair and have an impairment affecting their legs or feet that would prohibit them from competing equally in able-bodied basketball. Players are allocated one of the sport classes described below. To ensure fairness, each team of five is allowed a maximum of 14 points on the field of play at the same time.</p> <p><strong>1.0:</strong> Players in sport class 1.0 have no trunk control and thus cannot bend forward or sideways or rotate to catch and pass the ball. To keep a stable position, the backrest of the wheelchair is higher and the athletes are strapped to the wheelchair.</p> <p><strong>2.0:</strong> These players can move lean forward and rotate their body to some extent, allowing them to catch the ball within a larger radius. Like their team members in sport class 1.0, their wheelchairs have a higher backrest and strapping for trunk support.</p> <p><strong>3.0:</strong> This profile describes players whose trunk control allows them to fully rotate and lean forward, but does not allow them to lean to the sides. As they do not need sitting support, their wheelchair has a low backrest.</p> <p><strong>4.0:</strong> Players can partially lean forward and partially to the sides as well. Often players in this class can lean to one side only.</p> <p><strong>4.5:</strong> Players have no restriction in trunk rotation or leaning forward or sideways.</p> <p>An athlete can also be allocated the sport classes <strong>1.5</strong>, <strong>2.5</strong> or <strong>3.5</strong>. The activity profiles of these half-pointers fit in between those of the lower and higher class.</p> <h2>Wheelchair fencing </h2> <p>All wheelchair fencers have an impairment of their legs or feet that prohibits them from competing against standing, non-disabled fencers. There are two sport classes:</p> <p><strong>Category A:</strong> Fencers have good trunk control, allowing them to move forward and sideways when attracting their opponent or dodging an attack. Also, their fencing arm is fully functional.</p> <p><strong>Category B:</strong> Fencers either have worse trunk control than described in category A and full control of their fencing arm, or they have full trunk control and minimally reduced function in their fencing arm.</p> <h2>Wheelchair rugby</h2> <p>Players are also allocated one of seven different sport classes: <strong>0.5</strong>, <strong>1.0</strong>, <strong>1.5</strong>, <strong>2.0</strong>, <strong>2.5</strong>, <strong>3.0</strong> and <strong>3.5</strong>, described below, with 0.5 being indicating the most significant activity limitation. The total number of points on court during a game for four players may not exceed eight.</p> <p><strong>0.5:</strong> Players show significant shoulder instability and limitations in their upper arm and hand functions. Most have no trunk or leg control. The player would typically catch the ball by tapping it into the lap and throw the ball with a scoop pass.</p> <p><strong>1.5:</strong> Players have better shoulder stability and arm and wrist function. They can do chest passes, but the instability of their wrists makes ball handling difficult. Some players might have one side of their body more strongly affected than the other.</p> <p><strong>2.5:</strong> Players have good shoulder stability and arm function. They might have some trunk control. Due to their ability to flex their fingers, they can perform overhead passes, catch the ball with two hands and manoeuvre the wheelchair better than their team mates in the lower sport classes.</p> <p><strong>3.5:</strong> Least severe eligible impairment. Due to a less significant impairment of their shoulders, trunk, arms and hands, player are good ball handlers and can move quickly on the court.</p> <h2>Wheelchair tennis </h2> <p>There are two sport classes, and all players have in common that they have an impairment that affects their mobility.</p> <p><strong>Open class:</strong> Athletes who have a significant and permanent impairment of one or both legs and full arm function.</p> <p><strong>Quad class:</strong> Players have an impairment affecting their arm function, as well as their legs. This limits their ability to grip the racket and to move in the wheelchair.</p> <p>\u2022 Taken from the International Paralympic Committee's Layman's Guide to Paralympic Classification.

  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>The Obama administration's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/us-cia-detainee-prison-deaths\">aggressive, full-scale whitewashing of the \"war on terror\" crimes</a> committed by Bush officials is now complete.

This decision, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/us/holder-rules-out-prosecutions-in-cia-interrogations.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1\">says the New York Times Friday</a>, \"eliminat[es] the last possibility that any criminal charges will be brought as a result of the brutal interrogations carried out by the CIA\".</p> <p>To see what a farce this is, it is worthwhile briefly to review the timeline of how Obama officials acted to shield Bush torturers from all accountability. During his 2008 campaign for president, Obama <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Barack_on_torture.html\">repeatedly vowed</a> that, while he opposed \"partisan witch-hunts\", he would instruct his attorney general to \"immediately review\" the evidence of criminality in these torture programs because \"nobody is above the law.\" Yet, almost immediately after winning the 2008 election, Obama, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html?pagewanted=all\">before he was even inaugurated</a>, made clear that he was opposed to any such investigations, citing what he called \"a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards\".</p> <p>Throughout the first several months of his presidency, his top political aides, such as the <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/rahm-emanuel-sez-no-bush-officals-shoul\">chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel</a>, and his <a href=\"http://www.talkleft.com/story/2009/4/20/19221/2215\">press secretary, Robert Gibbs</a>, publicly \u2013 and inappropriately \u2013 pressured the justice department to refrain from any criminal investigations. Over and over, they repeated the Orwellian mantra that such investigations were objectionable because \"we must look forward, not backward\". As Gibbs put it in April 2009, when asked to explain Obama's opposition, \"the president is focused on looking forward. That's why.\"</p> <p>On 16 April 2009, Obama himself took the first step in formalizing the full-scale immunity he intended to bestow on all government officials involved even in the most heinous and lethal torture. On that date, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/16/AR2009041602768.html\">he decreed</a> absolute immunity for any official involved in torture provided that it comported with <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com.br/2009/07/immunization-program-by-digby-needless.html\">the permission slips</a> produced by Bush department of justice (DOJ) lawyers which authorized certain techniques. \"This is a time for reflection, not retribution,\" the new president so movingly observed in his statement announcing this immunity. Obama added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[N]othing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past \u2026 we must resist the forces that divide us, and instead come together on behalf of our common future.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Note how, in Obama's new formulation, those who believed that Bush officials should be held criminally accountable for their torture crimes \u2013 should be subjected to the rule of law on equal terms with ordinary citizens \u2013 were now scorned as \"the forces that divide us\". On the same day, Holder issued his own statement arguing that \"it would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the justice department.\"</p> <p>But at least this limited immunity left open the possibility of prosecuting those agents who went beyond the limits of the DOJ memos in how they tortured: in other words, those \"rogue\" torturers who used brutality and savagery beyond even what was permitted by Bush lawyers. On several occasions, Holder had flamboyantly leaked that he was horrified by what he read in certain case files about detainees who were severely injured by torture or even killed by it \u2013 there were <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/06/30/accountability_7/\">more than 100 detainees who died while in US custody</a> \u2013 and that he could not, in good conscience, simply sweep all of that under the rug.</p> <p>As a result, in August 2009, Holder <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/25/nation/na-interrogate-prosecutor25\">announced</a> a formal investigation to determine whether criminal charges should be brought in over 100 cases of severe detainee abuse involving \"off-the-books methods\" such as \"mock execution and threatening a prisoner with a gun and a power drill\", as well as threats that \"prisoners [would be] made to witness the sexual abuse of their relatives.\" But less than two years later, on 30 June 2011, Holder <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/30/nation/la-na-cia-interrogations-20110701\">announced</a> that of the more than 100 cases the justice department had reviewed, there would be no charges brought in any of them \u2013 except two.</p> <p>The only exceptions were <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43596191/ns/us_news-security/t/doj-investigate-deaths-detainees-cia-custody/\">two particularly brutal cases</a>, both of which resulted in the death of the detainee. One involved the 2002 abuse of Gul Rahman, who <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/06/world/main6368610.shtml\">froze to death</a> in a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan known as the \"Salt Pit\", after he was beaten, stripped, and then shackled to a cement wall in freezing temperatures. </p> <p>The other was the 2003 death of Manadel al-Jamadi at Abu Ghraib, who <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4977986\">died in CIA custody</a> after he was beaten, stripped, had cold water poured on him, and then shackled to the wall. It was al-Jamadi's ice-packed body which was infamously photographed with a smiling US Army Sgt Charles Granier standing over it giving the thumbs-up sign. </p> <p>A US military autopsy declared al-Jamadi's death a homicide due to \"blunt force trauma to the torso complicated by compromised respiration\". Autopsy photos showed \"lacerations and multiple bruises on Jamadi's feet, thighs and arms\", though \"his most significant injuries \u2013 five broken ribs \u2013 are not visible in the photos.\" A physician told NPR back in 2005:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'How Jamadi was shackled 'makes it very difficult to breathe because you are suspended in a very awkward position. When you combine it with having the hood over your head and having broken ribs, it's fairly clear that this death was caused by asphyxia because he couldn't breathe properly.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, those are the two cases which the DOJ this week announced it was closing without any charges of any kind being brought. Because the Obama administration has systematically blocked all other cases besides these two from any possibility of criminal charges, yesterday's decision means that <em>nobody</em> in the US government will pay any price for the systematic worldwide torture regime which that nation implemented and maintained for close to a decade.</p> <p>This is so despite the <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/06/18/41514/general-who-probed-abu-ghraib.html\">findings of General Antonio Taguba</a>, who investigated the torture regime and said that \"there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes\" and \"the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account.\" And it is done even in the face of <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/04/gen_barry_mccaffrey_ret_allege.html\">General Barry McCaffrey's extraordinary observation</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We tortured people unmercifully. We probably murdered dozens of them during the course of that, both the armed forces and the CIA.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jameel-jaffer\">ACLU's Jameel Jaffer</a> <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/aclu-on-obama-doj-announcement.html\">yesterday said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That the justice department will hold no one accountable for the killing of prisoners in CIA custody is nothing short of a scandal \u2026 the decision not to file charges against individuals who tortured prisoners to death is yet another entry in what is already a shameful record.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Beyond the disgust that these events, on their own, should invoke in any decent person, there are two points worth making about all of this which really highlight just how odious all of it is.</p> <p><em>First</em>, Obama has shielded Bush torture crimes not only from criminal prosecution, but any and all forms of accountability. Obama himself <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/us/politics/24cong.html\">vigorously opposed and succeeded in killing even a congressional investigation</a> into the torture regime at a time when his party controlled both houses of Congress. </p> <p>Moreover, Obama's top officials, as WikiLeaks cables revealed, secretly worked with GOP operatives to coerce other countries, such as <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/12/wikileaks-cable-obama-quashed-torture-investigation\">Spain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/12/08/wikileaks-revelations-that-bush-and-obama-put-pressure-on-germany-and-spain-not-to-investigate-us-torture/\">Germany</a>, to quash their investigations into the US torture of their citizens, and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/12/obama_101/\">issued extraordinary threats</a> to prevent British courts from disclosing any of what was done. And probably worst of all, the Obama administration aggressively shielded Bush officials <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/09/torture-case-tossed/\">even from being held accountable in civil cases</a> brought by torture victims, by invoking <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/09/08/obama_138/\">radical secrecy powers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2011/07/21/obama-doj-doubles-down-on-presidents-ability-to-detain-us-citizens-with-no-charges/\">immunity doctrines</a> to prevent courts even from hearing those claims.</p> <p>In sum, the Obama administration has been desperate to ensure that there will be no accountability or even that meaningful investigations ever take place. That is almost certainly due to the fact that <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/04/24/democrats_24/\">numerous high-level members of Obama's own party</a> were so complicit in these crimes. But at least equally important is this remarkable \u2013 and, it turns out, prescient \u2013 observation from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/washington/13inquire.html\">a New York Times article by Charlie Savage in December 2008</a>, on the prospect of torture investigations aimed at Bush officials:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Because every president eventually leaves office, incoming chief executives have an incentive to quash investigations into their predecessor's tenure.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Obama is motivated to shield Bush officials from accountability for their crimes in the hope that once Obama leaves office, he, too, will be gifted identical immunity from the rule of law.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, although government torturers have now been fully protected by Obama from any accountability, those who blow the whistle on such crimes <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones\">continue to be pursued by the same administration with unprecedented aggression</a>. As Friday's Times article on Holder's announcement pointedly notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"While no one has been prosecuted for the harsh interrogations, a former CIA officer who helped hunt members of al-Qaida in Pakistan and later spoke publicly about waterboarding, John C Kiriakou, is awaiting trial on criminal charges that he disclosed to journalists the identity of other CIA officers who participated in the interrogations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Here, again, we see one of the prime precepts of American justice: high-level official who commit even the most egregious crimes are shielded from all accountability; the only real \"criminals\" are those who speak publicly about those crimes.</p> <p>When Obama first announced his intent to run for president, he vowed that \"the era of Scooter Libby justice \u2026 will be over\" \u2013 meaning high-level officials will no longer be able to break the law with impunity. In mid 2008, Holder <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/08/23/will-holder-s-reckoning-on-detainee-abuse-fall-flat.html\">denounced</a> Bush's illegal torture and surveillance programs as showing \"disrespect for the rule of law\", and he vowed:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We owe the American people a reckoning.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To say those <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/At_least_not_quite_as_many_people_died_when_Obama_lied.html\">pledges have been radically violated</a> is to understate the case. Far worse, though, is that Obama officials have bolstered the warped precept at the root of so many of America's disasters: that crimes committed by and at the behest of the powerful reside above and beyond the rule of law. In so doing, they have ensured that Bush officials who authorized torture continue to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80451.html?hp=l3_b5\">command mainstream respectability</a>, while future leaders tempted to torture again have no reason whatsoever to refrain from doing so. </p> <p>This final act in the sorry spectacle has long been predictable, even inevitable. But that does not make it any less repellent.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: I was on Democracy Now this morning with Amy Goodman discussing Holder's announcement.

  "<p>A gay man in Brazil has been granted a four-month \"maternity\" leave for a child he and his civil partner adopted.</p> <p>Lucimar da Silva will be the first father in his country to benefit from a paid leave equal in length to the one granted to a mother, rather than the usual five days off work for paternity.</p> <p>When two years ago Da Silva, a banker from Gravesend in the Brazilian southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, and his partner, Rafael Gerhardt, adopted their child, the couple went to court to argue that at least one of them should be entitled to a longer period of leave.</p> <p>Brazil's social security agency has now agreed with the men that it would be discriminatory if one of them was not granted the time off. Da Silva will now take the longer leave.</p> <p>\"However unusual it may seem to grant maternity leave to a male person \u2026 this hypothesis is possible when the father takes care of the newborn,\" the agency said, according to the quotes carried by the website of the Brazilian TV network O Globo.</p> <p>This decision, however, does not set a legal precedent, according to the agency, and other gay couples seeking the same privilege in future should challenge the state individually. Lesbian couples can already have the four-month leave.</p> <p>In a landmark decision in May 2011, Brazil's supreme court ruled that same-sex partners were entitled to every legal right enjoyed by heterosexual couples.</p> <p>\"With this decision for Da Silva, our rights as citizens are more recognised by the state,\" Carlos Tufvesson, a prominent Brazilian gay rights activist based in Rio de Janeiro told the Guardian, adding that despite the supreme court's decision, there was still more work to be done because the ruling had not been respected entirely across the country.</p> <p>\"As gay activists, we don't fight to gain any special rights. We are fighting to have the same rights as any other citizen and our constitution is very clear when it states that every citizen is equal before the law,\" he added.</p> <p>In the UK, one of the two adoptive parents, who may both be the same sex, qualifies for 52 weeks' leave provided he or she has been employed for 26 weeks at the qualification date, according to Stonewall, a charity working for equality and justice for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals.</p>",
  "<p>When clubs hurl vast amounts into the transfer market they will often convince themselves that those sums are just the premiums paid on an insurance policy. Status is supposed to be secure thereafter.</p> <p>The logic is easy to follow among the well-funded managers. Roberto Di Matteo, for instance, was bound to bolster the Chelsea squad. The only issue more frightening than the expenditure is the prospect of decline if substantial sums are not spent.</p> <p>Financial fair play regulations should eventually check that impulse, but few doubted how Chelsea would conduct themselves this summer. Victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League final came in a penalty shootout. It could just as easily have gone against them and the club might currently have been telling itself that the Europa League holds a subtle charm.</p> <p>Chelsea appreciated that the lineup needed an infusion of flair. So it was with that they handed over some \u00a332m to take Eden Hazard from Lille. His immediate impact made it look as if the economics of football might have a semblance of good sense and the same might be said of Oscar, the 20-year-old midfielder who cost \u00a325m from the Brazilian club Internacional.</p> <p>There are indeed all too many examples to remind us that footballers never really come with a warranty, no matter how much is spent. It is Andy Carroll who at present reminds managers that a hefty outlay puts their reputation and even job prospects at stake.</p> <p>Indeed, the \u00a335m that Liverpool handed over to Newcastle United for Carroll would have been a prominent issue when the decision was being taken to sack Kenny Dalglish. The new manager, Brendan Rodgers, has packed off the striker to West Ham on loan.</p> <p>Investing in the transfer market is bound to be excruciating on occasion. Footballers, as with any human being, can be disoriented when they swap one environment for another. People tend to forget just how Carroll flourished with Newcastle. The 2010-11 campaign showed then that he could act as rather more than a target man.</p> <p>The first half of that season, before the January switch to Anfield, had seen him find the net against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City. There was no cause to suppose that his success depended on bullying the weak. At the time, Dalglish had not appeared eccentric or foolish in buying such a player, even if the fee itself was large.</p> <p>Managers may find it a little easier to maintain perspective in the summer than they do in the throes of mid-season anxiety, but the pressure is still there to an extent. Roberto Mancini seemed to have an array of targets at Manchester City, ranging from the seasoned Maicon at Internazionale to the young Scott Sinclair, who has arrived from Swansea City.</p> <p>The cost hardly registers with the public when clubs of outlandish means enter the marketplace, but many managers are obliged to take care. Arsenal sell well and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is practised when explaining why he does not buy at those sort of prices. Nuri Sahin, of Real Madrid, eluded him and has gone on loan to Liverpool instead, but the Arsenal manager remarked that he already had a midfielder of that sort in Jack Wilshere.</p> <p>This, of course, rather ignored the fact that an ankle injury stopped him from playing last season and he has yet to show he is ready for a return to the intensity of the Premier League. Wenger appreciates that Arsenal still have to pay off the debt incurred in building the Emirates, although that sum is under \u00a3100m after standing at \u00a3318m in 2008.</p> <p>Many managers have to be careful in their spending and Sir Alex Ferguson comes into that category. He has splashed out on Robin van Persie, but there is the shrewdness of an individual whose means were extremely limited in the early days of his career. At \u00a317m, the price paid for Borussia Dortmund's Shinji Kagawa will be a coup if he proves any sort of successor to Paul Scholes.</p> <p>Clubs will also pay readily to acquire a sense of security. At a cost of \u00a39m, Jan Vertonghen might well provide some solidity at the core of the Tottenham Hotspur defence as the new manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, goes about his work. There are interesting projects everywhere and, for instance, Martin O'Neill's effort to get a reliable contribution out of Adam Johnson, following a \u00a310m transfer from Manchester City, should be intriguing.</p> <p>Mark Hughes's project is on a larger scale than most, his total of acquisitions for Queens Park Rangers in double figures. A 5-0 loss to Swansea implied that the assimilation process had barely begun, but at least there has since been a draw at Norwich City.</p> <p>Outcomes are always difficult to predict. As managers may often complain, footballers, regardless of the cost, are as unpredictable as the rest of the human race.</p>",
  "<p>The UK Border Agency's decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-visa-revoked?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">withdraw London Metropolitan University's licence to accept non-EU students</a> has meant the suspension of study and threat of deportation for 2,000 international students, and financial crisis for a university already struggling to stay afloat. The agency's justification is London Met's \"systemic failure\" to account for the immigration status of its international students. But why has the survival of a university, whose raison d'\u00eatre is to educate, come to depend on its ability to control the UK's borders?</p> <p>One <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/lmu-student-recruitment-teaching-learning?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">London Met lecturer has written anonymously claiming</a> of his institution that: \"This is not a university that is run well. The UK Border Agency basically says as much.\" Is this what higher education has come to? That people allow an agency that has nothing to do with education to judge whether or not a university is \"run well\". She/he hopes that the agency's decision will mean the elimination of those students whose English is not up to scratch. Rather than cutting them loose, the solution to students struggling with English skills, whether home or international, is to provide them with extra support \u2013 difficult of course in a climate of budget cuts, but not impossible, and my own university is testament to this.</p> <p>It is obscene that those students already in the UK at a well-established institution will be uprooted from their homes and have their legitimate expectation to complete their studies dashed.</p> <p>The agency's move has been criticised on a number of fronts, seen as part of a wider attack by the coalition government on education institutions already suffering the effects of hikes in tuition fees and cuts to public funding. A <a href=\"http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/amnesty-for-international-students-at-london-metropolit.html\" title=\"\">petition</a> calls for an amnesty for the thousands of international students whose studies have been terminated, and urges that they be allowed to complete their studies while \"the problems at London Met are addressed\". While an amnesty for these students is absolutely necessary, a fundamental perspective is missing from the debate: universities should never have been made to play the role of immigration and border control officials. The role of universities is to educate, not to police.</p> <p>The sponsorship system devised by the border agency permits universities to accept international students on to their courses on condition that they enforce immigration controls. According to the agency, the system is based on the principle that \"those who benefit most directly from migration \u2026 help to prevent the system being abused\". It seems fair to assume that the agency is alluding here to the universities reaping the economic benefits of international students through charging extortionate fees. But universities should not be in such a poorly funded condition that they have to economically exploit international students.</p> <p>Of course the true benefit brought by international students is their contribution to the creation of a multicultural environment which enriches the learning experience and expands the horizons of all on campus. But rather than welcome these students, the message from a government fixated on immigration control, spurred on by anti-immigration groups keen to blame migrants for society's ills, is to treat them as suspected scroungers or potential terrorists. Under-pressure university administrations insist lecturers police their classes to prevent those without a valid visa entering, monitor levels of \"radicalism\" among students, and take registers to record the attendance of international students even where attendance is not compulsory. Such discrimination in the classroom goes against the ethical principles and traditions of academia, sowing mistrust and corrupting the atmosphere within universities.</p> <p>How convenient then for the government that the debate over the revocation of London Met's sponsorship licence has skipped over the fundamental problem: that government policy treats international students as cash cows and turns universities and their staff into henchmen of its invidious immigration system.</p>",
  "<p>For almost two decades, The Stage has dished out awards to actors at the <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/37167/winners-announced-for-the-stages-edinburgh\" title=\"\">Edinburgh fringe</a>. Not, it's worth stressing, for performances \u2013 but for acting. There's a crucial distinction here: obviously not all performance is acting, though acting is necessarily a mode of performance. Actually, when you come to think about it, given the melee of forms and modes in contemporary theatre and performance \u2013 particularly visible in Edinburgh \u2013 \"acting\" can look like a rather odd word.</p> <p>It's a point taken up by one of this year's judges, Honour Bayes, at her <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8831345707809&amp;ref=london&amp;preview=Y\" title=\"\">Whatsonstage blog</a> in two different posts. First, she begs the question directly, with the rather pleasing effect (presumably unintended?) of opening out a judging process that takes place behind closed doors. \"Can you give an acting award to someone for being themselves or a version of themselves?\" she wonders. \"Can you award an acting prize for astonishing physical ensemble work that favours form and structure over psychology?\" Bayes thinks not \u2013 and I think she's probably right \u2013 but, like the distinction between new writing and new work, it's another example of problematically rigid labels in an increasingly fluid, amorphous field.</p> <p>Bayes goes on to look at political theatre in <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/blog/theatre/london/E8831346229320/Honour+Bayes%3A+The+politics+of+performance.html\" title=\"\">another post</a>, distinguishing political drama pure from other forms of performance. Shows like Torycore, a piece that describes itself as \"George Osborne's budget speech delivered as death metal\", Kieran Hurley's paean to rave culture, Beats, or Valentijn Daenens's examination of rhetoric, Bigmouth, wear their \"politics much more obliquely ... finding new ways to express their anger and dissatisfaction,\" says Bayes. \"These shows tape into something lost long ago in the spin of political language.\"</p> <p>Another performance register that doesn't sit entirely comfortably with straightforward \"acting\" is improvisation. Because improv is inherently shape-shifting, it often gets bypassed by theatre critics, but it is a fascinating mode of performance; \"both written and acted simultaneously,\" says Sean London, a Los Angeles-based improviser. In a <a href=\"http://downrightupright.com/post/30337439367/commitment-at-all-levels\" title=\"\">fascinating blog</a>, London argues against received wisdom that \"the best improv scenes should look like a written sketch\". However, London feels that means \"the best improv, purportedly, ignores and attempts to hide that which makes it special\" \u2013 the thrill of watching performers flying by the seat of their pants. In other words, aren't we, as an audience, craving something that actively courts failure, teeters on the edge, sometimes falling, sometimes saving itself with ingenuity, rather than polish and perfection?</p> <p>This cropped up, intriguingly, in a fringe review of <a href=\"http://www.ayoungertheatre.com/edinburgh-fringe-review-the-showstoppers-gilded-balloon/\" title=\"\">Showstoppers</a>, who improvise musicals. The show was so slick that the reviewer in question didn't believe it was improvised \u2013 something that promptly kicked up a storm in the comment thread. Was the piece \"meticulously planned\", or just very effectively improvised? Does it matter? Interesting questions.</p> <p>Of course, it might be said, improvisation is at the heart of great acting. And great acting comes in all shapes and sizes. Check out the <a href=\"http://ghostlightchicago.blogspot.it/2008/09/poison-boot.html\" title=\"\">Ghostlight Chicago</a> blog, which several years ago featured a story so incredible that it makes you wonder if it's urban legend. At the end of a performance of a major musical (saying which one would spoil it, and it's not clear quite when or where it happened), just as one character goes to shoot another, the stage gun jammed. What on earth to do? Wrestle the other actor to the ground? Improvise a strangling? Nope. Apparently the actor tossed aside the weapon, charged across the stage and kicked his co-star in the shin, while yelling \"Poison boot!\" at the top of his voice. Now if that's not award-worthy, I don't know what is.</p>",

  "<p><strong>To coincide with the funeral of Neil Armstrong, who died at the weekend, Piers Sellers, the British-born Nasa astronaut now deputy director of the sciences and exploration directorate at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre, pays tribute.</strong></p> <p>First up, Neil Armstrong is my hero. He's absolutely iconic. He's the astronauts' astronaut.</p> <p>It's amazing when you look at what he did. The business of flying the X-15, which was basically a piece of steel pipe with a rocket on the end, was dangerous enough. Then there was the Gemini 8 which went out of control, but he managed to figure out what was going on, saving the spacecraft, his crew mate and himself. That was incredible. And then there was landing on the moon itself. This man's career, as a test pilot and as an astronaut, is completely peerless.</p> <p>But, I think, the man himself was a more complex and richer personality than many give him credit for. He was a very dedicated engineer who became a professor of engineering when he retired from Nasa. He was really interested in how science and technology influence society and the development of civilisation. He was a deep thinker, insightful, well-rounded, not your ordinary \"fighter jock\".</p> <p>I met him several times. He was a very quiet man, a little reticent, and I think he was always like that. I don't think it was just because of the whole business of being the first man on the moon.</p> <p>I remember the moon landing very clearly. Before it, I had started reading more about him. I was about 13 at the time and he was a total inspiration to me. Here was a person doing very difficult things and understanding every aspect of what he was doing. He wasn't just pulling knobs and levers, he really understood everything going on behind the dash when he was driving fighters or spacecraft around.</p> <p>I watched the moon landing as a kid in England on my little grainy black-and-white TV. There was James Burke and Patrick Moore commentating at the time. It was tremendous.</p> <p>I followed the whole thing. I had posters on the walls. I made all the Airfix models. It was tremendously exciting and it inspired me to do science and to do what I'm doing now. Before I became aware of the space programme it wasn't clear to me where science and engineering could take you. This was resoundingly interesting. And, out of all the astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Jim Lovell, for me, were the two stand-outs.</p> <p>Armstrong had so many admirable qualities; supreme skill, courage and accomplishment as well as real humility and dignity. He had respect from everybody. I remember earlier this year when he came to visit Congress to receive the congressional gold medal from President Obama with the Apollo 11 crew and John Glenn, the whole of Congress was falling over themselves to try and get near him.</p> <p>Obviously, he will forever be remembered as the first man on the moon, the first human being to put their foot on anything other than Earth. That's huge. That's his legacy. But I think for those people who are in the business of science, technology and aviation, as they learn more about him, they will find a lot to admire and to emulate.</p> <p>He was the best of the best. The man was a master.</p> <p>I saw him earlier this year and he looked great. He was looking fit and I thought he had plenty of runway ahead of him.</p> <p>His death is very sad. I know that he wanted to see people going back to the moon, and going elsewhere during his lifetime. Hopefully, that will happen sometime soon.</p> <p>He is really something for the rest of us to try and live up to.</p>",
  "<p>In the days before establishing himself as the swaggering firebrand of African-American cinema, targeting racial tensions in films such as Malcolm X and Do the Right Thing, Spike Lee nursed an unlikely ambition. He longed to sing ABC on primetime TV, just like his childhood idol.</p> <p>\"You could say I grew up with Michael Jackson,\" the director told journalists at the Venice film festival. \"I was born in 1957, he was born in '58. And when I saw the Jackson Five on the Ed Sullivan Show I wanted to be Michael Jackson. I had the Afro, the whole Jackson look. But the singing and dancing \u2013 that's where it stopped.\"</p> <p>Four decades later, Lee pays a belated tribute to his hero on Bad 25 \u2013 an exhaustive, track-by-track tour through the recording of Jackson's 1987 album and the world tour that followed. Bad was the record that saw Jackson setting out to redefine his image. The promotional videos cast him in the role of lethal jungle cat, facing down heavyweight hoodlums or tracking leggy vixens down ghetto streets - even though this was not his natural habitat. On finally catching the girl, for instance, the cripplingly shy Jackson couldn't bring himself to kiss her and opted for a chaste embrace instead. Elsewhere, director Martin Scorsese recalls the singer's horror at shooting the flagship Bad video in the projects of Harlem: \"He looked around and said, 'Do people really live here?'.\"</p> <p>Lee described Bad 25 as his \"love letter\" to Michael Jackson \u2013 a chance to accentuate the positive. \"There's been a lot of focus on the personal stuff,\" he said. \"I wanted this film to concentrate on the music. It was a chance to dig into his creative process. The film shows that Michael did not just sit on his ass. He was out there watching Bob Fosse, Gene Kelly, James Brown and Fred Astaire. He studied the greats and then made himself greater.\"</p>",
  "<p>The setting seemed rather incongruous. Michel Platini stood Uefa suited and booted on a sun-drenched terrace of a plush Monte Carlo hotel, the Mediterranean lapping gently on the shore of the French Riviera below and luxury yachts drifting across the bay behind. One might have belonged to Roman Abramovich whose Chelsea, fresh from a summer spending spree that skirts \u00a380m, were due to contest the European Super Cup on Friday night.</p> <p>The scene oozed glitz and glamour and yet it was here, in this money-drenched enclave that boasts the highest number of millionaires per capita in the world, that Uefa's president delivered his annual reminder on all things financial fair play (FFP). The implementation of a scheme rubber-stamped four years ago is under way with the implications of the rules that have attracted most attention, that clubs have to break even, already being felt. \"We wanted to revolutionise European football when we first introduced this idea,\" said the president. \"We are never going back on this.\"</p> <p>That mantra was repeated three times as if delivered for the oligarchs, American franchises and sheikhs who have transformed the face of football in recent years. Platini was speaking as clubs across Europe whipped themselves into a frenzy ahead of the closure of the transfer window. There is, Uefa insists, a uniform desire for FFP to work \u2013 both in terms of ensuring teams meet their existing debts, but also do not overstretch themselves \u2013 and yet the period since the plans were first made public has seen the continued spending of Chelsea, the eye-catching emergence of Manchester City and, more recently, Paris St-Germain, as well as clubs across Russia whose outlay on wages and in the transfer market would, at first glance, appear to fly in the face of all things FFP.</p> <p>Those clubs argue they are not spending beyond their means, pointing to commercial revenues and sponsorship deals to justify their considerable clout. But there is also the example of M\u00e1laga, a club purchased by Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser al-Thani of the Qatari royal family and who were heavy spenders last season, only for the owner's interest apparently to wane and funds dry up. There have been transfer bans, the threat of legal action over unpaid wages and a player exodus since, with this the kind of meltdown FFP is aimed at preventing. Clubs bought on a whim can be discarded and left to disintegrate just as quickly.</p> <p>\"It can happen at M\u00e1laga, it has happened at Portsmouth, it can happen everywhere,\" said Platini. \"Many people are coming into the game to make business, to make popularity ... some actually love football, but remember Uefa are there to protect [the clubs], not kill them. I just want clubs to spend money they have, not what they don't have. I've spoken to football directors, chairmen and owners from all over the world, I've spoken to Manchester City's owners in Abu Dhabi, and everybody has given their commitment to this plan. Some aren't necessarily showing it, but we have been very clear with them. We have put the structure in place to implement these rules. If clubs do not respect the rules, they will get into difficulty, whether they are from France, from Italy, from England, from Georgia ...\"</p> <p>The sanctions will range from warnings, reprimands and fines, to the deduction of points, disqualification or exclusion from competitions and withdrawal of titles. The break-even rule comes into effect from the 2014-15 season \u2013 Uefa's club financial control body is taking into account the financial years 2012 and 2013 \u2013 though the other element of FFP, the overdue payments rule where commitments have not been met to players or other clubs for transfers, has been running since last year. The Hungarian club Gyori, AEK Athens and Besiktas are already banned from European competition. Disciplinary procedures are under way against another 27 clubs, who are in the process of being informed.</p> <p>There was a criticism of national associations who allow such mismanagement to occur in their leagues \u2013 \"Sometimes the associations don't do their work and we have to come after [them]\" \u2013 though the threat of punishment, Platini suggested, is already having an effect. While Chelsea and PSG have poured money into recruitment, the average spend in the last two windows was actually well down on previous years. There was a 36% decrease in the winter window, from \u20ac613m (\u00a3487m) in January 2011 to \u20ac393m this year. Indeed, 2012's transfer spend of \u20ac2.146bn to 30 August represented only 78% of the 2008-11 average. Some might put that down to a difficult economic climate. Uefa and its president insist it is the shadow being cast by the imminent new rules.</p> <p>How, then, does a proud Frenchman react to Ligue 1 boasting arguably the richest club in the world given the money PSG has flung at Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva, Lucas Moura and Ezequiel Lavezzi? \"I'm not here to be proud or popular,\" added Platini. \"I have to do my job as president of Uefa. We take decisions that apply for English, French and Russian clubs. Perhaps I will be unpopular [in France], but they will respect me.</p> <p>\"Anyway, you think people in Paris think about financial fair play and PSG? Most people in Paris don't even know there's a club in Paris \u2026 It's not London. This is France. It's different, even if people are surprised at the amount of money PSG are paying the players. They are not used to that.\"</p> <p>That sense of shock will apply to those clubs who fail to comply in the years ahead. The message from Monaco was clear.</p>",
  "<p>Do you know why America fared so badly at Pearl Harbor, leading to the deaths of thousands of men that would draw them into the killing fields of the second world war? It's not because they were under-prepared (although they were) \u2013 it was due to the fact that they placed the entirety of their airborne defence in the hands of a single inexperienced pilot who crashed explosively into nearby buildings at every opportunity.</p> <p>Damage Inc is a second world war flight sim, giving the player control of Bobby \u2013 a pilot defending the Pacific against Japanese forces. Despite his propensity for crashing into the ground whenever he tries to shoot at anything below his level and his inability to take off without wobbling the plane around like a trolley with a broken wheel, Bobby is frequently entrusted with defending important military installations against the wrath of Japan because Bobby can slow down time.</p> <p>Pushing the right shoulder button (or one of the switches on the joystick in an arm-crossing uncomfortable position) makes time slow to a crawl, the camera zoom in, and everything including your target uncomfortably blurry. There's no limit on how much this can be used, so dogfights are often nothing more than a race to the enemy planes before hitting the magical slow-motion button and calmly blowing them away.</p> <h2>This game makes Ben Affleck look like a good actor</h2> <p>Bobby's quest for revenge and glory following the death of his brother Jimmy thanks to a Japanese attack gets fairly ridiculous quick off the bat \u2013 within an hour of the game starting, he manages to outperform the unfortunately-named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bong\" title=\"Wikipedia Link to Bong bio\">Richard Ira \"Dick\" Bong</a> , the United States' highest-scoring flying ace, with his 41st kill in the air. Despite Damage Inc's promises of realism, this game is closer to the film version of Pearl Harbor than it is to the event itself.</p> <p>It's worse-acted than the film, even, having the appearance of being made on a shoestring in an attempt to flog joysticks \u2013 the game comes boxed with a giant, reassuringly chunky joystick specifically designed for your console \u2013 as no one sounds like they've read their lines more than once. Bobby reads his words like he's a robot discovering language for the first time. It's both over-written and under-written at the same time which almost counts an achievement.</p> <p>At one point, a dramatic cutscene triggered just after my plane crashed and played all the way through without any voice acting or my plane anywhere to be seen, before the game told me I had failed the mission. When I restarted the cutscene played again, but this time it consisted of 45 seconds of footage of water glitching into the skybox with the voices of Bobby and his control tower droning on about loss and virtue before I was congratulated with mission success.</p> <p>The missions themselves get repetitive quickly and often fail to excite, which is a fair assessment of the majority of military life but not much fun to endure as a paying customer.</p> <p>The game starts off ugly and resolutely stays there. The planes, which given more budget could have been properly fetishised into gleaming, decal-strewn machines of death instead look thin and unreal. The buildings on the ground, which you're encouraged to buzz past as part of your very first mission, look grubby and low-resolution.</p> <p>The explosions are quite nice, although nowhere near the oil-leaking twisted steel pornography of Konami's Ace Combat (released last year, presumably with a lot more money behind it and a casual disregard for historical accuracy).</p> <p>All told, the production values of the game are so low as to date it almost 10 years, feeling like a game you might have played on a friend's computer or downloaded off a demo disc from the front of a PC mag.</p> <h2>What's joyful and sticky?</h2> <p>That joystick, while it's a pleasure to hold and wiggle around while you make machinegun noises and wait for the game to load, is inexact and didn't appear to even work properly. More than once it failed to navigate the menus or trigger features on the plane when appropriate buttons were pushed.</p> <p>Joysticks might be authentic, but experimenting with a standard joypad provided much easier control with all the relevant buttons in reach of fingers and much more precise control over the plane's movements with the thumbsticks. There's a reason we hold pencils at the pointy end, rather than grasping the bit with the rubber on it and jabbing it at the paper.</p> <p>That said, the big throttle control on the back of the joystick is dead fun to use and far superior to fiddling with the right thumbstick.</p> <h2>Promises, promises</h2> <p>The name Damage Inc promises more than the game can offer \u2013 that, coupled with the boxart, promises rag-tag groups of survivors, daring missions, and those really cool plane decals which feature either sharks or flames or busty pin-up ladies. Conversely, the joystick bundled in the squadron leader's edition and the assurances of realism promise a serious sim for serious people.</p> <p>But it's neither. It's on consoles, which is the wrong place for it; it's available on the PC too, but there are far better and more suitable titles for your money to be found already on release on every platform.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",
  "<p>Paul Watson, the fugitive head of international marine activism group Sea Shepherd who is wanted by the police on three continents, plans to avoid arrest by staying at sea as long as possible.</p> <p>In an exclusive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/31/paul-watson-clients-whales\" title=\"\">comment piece</a> for the Guardian, the Canadian-born environmentalist who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/26/paul-watson-skips-bail-germany\" title=\"\">skipped bail in Germany in July</a>, gives no clue to where he is except that he is in a \"safe haven\".

  "<p>A wildfire raging out of control along southern Spain's Costa del Sol has killed one man, injured several and forced the evacuation of thousands on the edge of the tourist resort of Marbella.</p> <p>More than 300 firefighters were battling the flames, which had spread several miles along hilly ground behind the coast, and 31 planes and helicopters were dumping water on the blaze.</p> <p>\"The fire is horrific, with flames 10 to 15 metres high,\" Angel Nozal, the mayor of Mijas, an inland town between Marbella and Malaga, told the national daily El Pa\u00eds.</p> <p>The charred body of an elderly man was found in a tool shed near Ojen, north of Marbella, and a man and a woman in their 50s were taken to the city's Costa del Sol hospital after suffering serious burns, the regional government of Andaluc\u00eda said.</p> <p>The fire broke out on Thursday outside the mountain town of Coin, before racing westwards through tinder-dry hilly countryside, fanned by strong winds and high temperatures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395492573\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/31/1346422273953/Malaga-wildfires-004.png\" alt=\"Malaga wildfires\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malaga wildfires Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thousands of people had to be hurriedly evacuated to a sports centre when the fire reached housing estates on the outskirts of Marbella.

Grinan said if this suspicion was proved it would be \"a criminal act\". Speaking on Cadena SER radio, Ruiz Espejo said one of the injured was in a serious condition.</p> <p>Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez, mayor of the popular whitewashed hillside tourist destination town of Mijas, said many residents had been evacuated, but strong east winds had \"fortunately for us, swept the fire westwards, towards Marbella\".</p> <p>A dry winter followed by a scorching hot summer has left much of southern Spain tinder dry. The country has seen 580&#xa0;sq miles of land burned in nearly 12,000 wildfires so far this year.</p> <p>\"This is without a doubt the worst fire we've had in Malaga,\" Elias Bendodo, president of Malaga council, told Spanish national radio. \"Thousands of people have been evacuated \u2026 Two people are definitely injured and \u2026 lots of houses have suffered damage.\"</p>",
  "<p>Each year for the last eight years, I have successfully led high-profile campaigns out of Australia to intervene against the shadowy operations of the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.</p> <p>These have been extremely dangerous operations in the hostile waters off Antarctica, against a whaling fleet backed by one of the world's most economically powerful nations.</p> <p>During this time our ships and crew have been shot at, rammed, one of them sliced in two and destroyed by a Japanese security vessel. At the same time, our tactics have been strategically designed to not cause injury or property damage and to stay within the boundaries of the law.</p> <p>Most importantly, every Sea Shepherd action has been thoroughly documented for the Animal Planet show, Whale Wars. Although this provides us with the evidence to defend ourselves against bogus accusations, it has also been a source of embarrassment for the Japanese government.</p> <p>We have demonstrated that their \"research\" whaling is nothing more than a mask for commercial operations.</p> <p>The Japanese insist that their shady whaling operations are legal. Australia and many other nations disagree. My position is that they should not be killing whales in a whale sanctuary.</p> <p>Through cutting kill quotas by blocking their lethal operations, we have reduced kill numbers dramatically, saving more than 4,000 whales and costing the whalers their profits.</p> <p>Our strategy of blocking the whaling fleet has driven this commercial whaling operation into substantial debt. They have continued to operate only because of massive government subsidies.</p> <p>As a result, in September of 2011, the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said that this was no longer about whaling but about not surrendering to Sea Shepherd, and in October, the government allocated \u00a319m from the Tsunami relief fund to the Japanese Fishery Agency for the purpose of stopping Sea Shepherd interventions.</p> <p>They immediately filed a lawsuit in the United States seeking a preliminary injunction to stop our ships from returning to the Southern Ocean. The injunction failed and the most recent Sea Shepherd campaign prevented the whalers from taking 74% of their kill quota.</p> <p>Japan had made a deal with a former crewmember after he was arrested for boarding the Japanese registered Shonan Maru #2, the ship that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/06/sea-shepherd-adygil-japan-whalers\" title=\"\">destroyed our trimaran</a>. This man was taken back to Japan and received a suspended sentence for trespassing in return for accusing me of ordering him to board the ship. The Whale Wars episode where this happens clearly shows me advising him not to board the Japanese vessel.</p> <p>The Japanese captain refused to co-operate with the Australian and New Zealand investigation into the sinking of the Sea Shepherd vessel and suffered no consequences for destroying the $1.5m boat. Yet based on false accusations, Japan is demanding my arrest. Why?</p> <p>Because they have the influence to do so and we do not have the financial resources and political power to have the Japanese captain charged.</p> <p>On 8 December 2011, Costa Rican president, Laura Chinchilla, travelled to Japan and met with Noda. At around the same time, Costa Rica made a request to Interpol for my extradition for an incident in April 2002 when Sea Shepherd had stopped an illegal Costa Rican shark-finning operation in Guatemalan waters. We did so with permission of the Guatemalan government and without injuring any of the poachers.</p> <p>Interpol had dismissed that decade-belated request, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/14/paul-watson-arrested-germany-sea-shepherd\" title=\"\">Germany decided to detain me nonetheless</a>.

  "<p>On Saturday week, 8 September, the second <a href=\"http://wigandiggersfestival.org/\">Diggers Festival</a> will take place in Wigan. Stephen Hall, one of the organisers, explains its significance to the town and his own enthusiasm:</p> <blockquote> <p>It came about because I noticed the <a href=\"http://www.192.com/atoz/business/wigan-wn1/political-parties/the-labour-party/ae01135606c75092c52c80cf771572d10e2d0f25/comp/\">Gerrard Winstanley House </a>in the town centre, and, after some research, discovered that Gerrard Winstanley was born here. </p> </blockquote> <p>Winstanley was the inspirational leader of the 17th century Diggers movement, whose members were also known as the 'True Levellers'. They were one of the first egalitarian political movements to represent the poor and those without property, and also argued for the equality of men and women.</p> <p>Winstanley's politics were driven by his own experiences. In 1630, aged 21 years old, he moved to London. He did well at first, but as a result of the abuse of power by both the King and Parliament and then the outbreak of&#xa0;the English Civil War in 1642 ,&#xa0;Winstanley saw his business ruined and in 1643 became bankrupt. His father-in-law helped him move to Cobham in Surrey, where he initially worked as a cowherd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395455255\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2011/7/21/1311243307007/A-still-from-Kevin-Brownl-002.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Kevin Brownlow's 1976 film Winstanley, showing a character in 17th-century costume\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Higgins as Digger Tom Haydon in Kevin Brownlow's 1976 film Winstanley. Courtesy of the British Film Institute</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time of the defeat of the Royalist side and King Charles' execution in January 1649, Winstanley and a group of others in a similar situation had got together to represent the voice of the common people, and especially that of the propertyless poor. Their name 'Diggers' came from their belief that the land should be available to every person to dig and sow, so that everyone, rich or poor, could live, grow and eat by the sweat of their own brows, for according to them:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The earth was made to be a common treasury for all.</p> </blockquote> <p>In 1649 Winstanley and the Diggers, who consisted of mainly poor families that had no land of their own, decided on direct action by taking over common land at St George's Hill in Surrey. It belonged to no one, and was not in use, so they started to farm it, to allow everyone who worked the land to eat. The government and wealthy landowners reacted by attacking the Diggers, destroying their homes and crops and eventually driving them from their land the following year.</p> <p>Stephen Hall believes that Winstanley's work in 1649 was inspired by the successes of Wigan clay and coal diggers \"who established their right to dig up common land to protect their livelihoods.\" He feels that this gives Wigan a claim to be \"the home of socialism\" and that Winstanley's views are as relevant today as they were in 1649, particularly given the economic situation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395455256\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/6/1315319965897/A-quote-by-Gerrard-Winsta-002.jpg\" alt=\"A quote by Gerrard Winstanley at a 'climate camp' at Heathrow in 2007\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relevant in modern times: a quote by Gerrard Winstanley at Heathrow climate camp in 2007.

As well as an exhibition detailing Winstanley's life, an actor John Graham Davies will play the Diggers' leader in a symbolic, part theatrical 'Digging re-enactment' and tree-planting ceremony.

  "<p>The thrill of a new series of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0\" title=\"\">Doctor Who</a> this time comes tempered with despair. Because tomorrow night, while the end of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/aug/15/doctor-who-asylum-of-the-daleks\" title=\"\">Asylum of the Daleks</a> will leave fans open-mouthed, there will also be one less adventure with the Ponds left to enjoy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/14/karen-gillan-doctor-who\" title=\"\">Karen Gillan</a> and Arthur Darvill leave Doctor Who at the end of this first, five-episode chunk of the new series, with Amy and Rory's fate still unclear. And, while we have grown to love Rory, the Doctor has almost always been defined by the women he travels about the universe with in non-sexual bliss \u2013 so it's time to look back on the era of The Girl Who Waited.</p> <p>It feels as though companions since the revival have found themselves described as \"feisty\" largely by virtue of being given a character. Amy was first introduced as an <em>actually</em> feisty companion; a flighty kissogram who made her grown-up debut whacking the Doctor with a baseball bat and pretending to be a police officer.</p> <p>Her choice of profession, not to mention her outfits, led the usual suspects to decry the character as \"too sexy\". But executive producer Piers Wenger was right when he called her \"feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number,\" saying that while she was probably the wildest companion the Doctor has travelled with, that didn't equate to promiscuity.</p> <p>But even that isn't the whole story. Amy is unique among companions in having had so much happen to her. More than anyone else, we have seen her develop and change. And she also is a companion of firsts: the first to have known the Doctor as a child; the first to actually jump him rather than simper at him; the first to be seen happily married. She's also the first to give birth to a murderous Timelady, and <em>absolutely</em> the first to become his mother-in-law.</p> <p>If there was a problem with Amy at first it was that she seemed a rootless collection of personality traits and enunciated sentence peaks. Plenty of people found the portrayal annoying. But that was the story \u2013 her parents had been sucked out of reality; we never got to see her at home. And that fairytale flavour <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/25/doctor-who-bbc-steven-moffat?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">executive producer Steven Moffat</a> brought along made her less familiar than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/oct/01/ihopebilliepiperdoesntret\" title=\"\">Rose Tyler</a>. But as the story has gone on, she has rounded as a character in the same way Gillan has toned down her delivery. Amy is now adored \u2013 and there are not many who can bury that much emotion about the kidnap and training-as-a-weapon of their daughter .</p> <p>All the Doctor's companions are intended to \"humanise\" him \u2013 but Amy is the companion you would want to be friends with. She'll think little of risking her life battling monsters \u2013 heck, she loves it \u2013 but she'd also bawl you out for spilling her mate's pint.</p> <p>And as Amy has matured, so has Gillan's performance. Coming from the worlds of sketch shows and modelling, her timing, sass and physical comedy were bang-on, but she took time to convince with more emotional scenes. One of the heartening things about a long story arc, such as the journey of the Ponds, is that we've seen how the gang have gelled. And what Gillan comes up with in the first episode of the new series may well make you weep.</p> <p>There is already feverish speculation about how Amy and Rory will leave. And we will come to that in time. But for now, let's sit back, and think about what Mrs Pond brought to the screen.</p>",

  "<p>Samsung has been showing off its new television sets at the <a href=\"http://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/en/\">IFA 2012</a> consumer electronics event in Berlin \u2013 and it seems super high-specs aren't enough to sell modern flatscreen HD displays anymore. You need games as well. Specifically one game in particular: Angry Birds.</p> <p>While showing off its new 75-inch LED ES9000 Smart TV, complete with internet access and specialist app store, the company revealed a new version of Angry Birds, which can be played with the television's gesture control technology. Rather like the Xbox Kinect technology, Samsung's catchily titled '<a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/2012-smart-tv/\">Smart TV with Gesture Control</a>' range all have a built-in camera that lets you control your television by wafting your arms around. For Angry Birds, you'll be able to catapult your furious avian missiles by... doing some sort of catapult gesture.</p> <p>It's interesting in the HD era, where pretty much every LCD set features variations on the same display technology, and most punters can't tell the difference anymore, manufacturers are having to become a bit more imaginative about how they differentiate their products. Turning televisions into gaming and web access devices seems to be the way ahead. Samsung's app store already boasts over 2000 applications.</p> <p>It's certainly not alone.

At the top of the West, <strong>San Jose Earthquakes</strong> host a <strong>Chivas USA</strong> side, who completed a stirring recovery on Wednesday night, but have conceded nine goals in two games. Still, it's not like the 'Quakes score many...</p> <p>Hold your nerve time - <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> and <strong>DC United </strong>face each other on Saturday night, with both their campaigns faltering at the wrong time. Ditto <strong>Vancouver Whitecaps</strong>, who've lost three in a row and must go to play-off rivals <strong>LA Galaxy</strong>, who are entering cruise control after trading in their early season clown car. Finally, <strong>FC Dallas</strong> hit their own speed bump in LA last week and things don't get any easier with the arrival of a <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong> side for whom Rosales is back to his imperious best.</p> <p>Always at their imperious best, our selection of fan reps, bloggers, podcasters, beat writers representing all the MLS sides in action this weekend. As always, they're looking back on how their team did last time out and what we can expect this week. Read what they have to say and leave your own predictions in the comments section - and join me for <strong>Columbus Crew vs Montreal Impact this Saturday at 7.30pm</strong> and Joe and I will be back with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/aug/27/mls-week-25-columbus-crew-new-england-revolution\">Five Things We Learned</a> on Monday morning - trying to make sense of it all.</p> <p><em>All time stated are EST</em></p> <h2>Portland Timbers vs Colorado Rapids, Fri 10.30pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Michael Orr</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.maofootball.wordpress.com\">Mao Football</a>, host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/soccer-made-in-portland/\">Soccer made in PDX</a> podcast:</p> <p>Last weekend, Portland Timbers got their first win in nine tries taking down Cascadia Cup rivals Vancouver Whitecaps 2-1. Darlington Nagbe scored in his third straight game and Franck Songo'o opened his Timbers account with a dipping free kick that was bungled into the goal by Joe Cannon. The three points are a first since July 3 and mark the first victory for the Timbers since the sacking of John Spencer. </p> <p>The good news extends beyond Saturday's win for Portland as 37-year old Caleb Porter was announced on Wednesday as the club's full-time replacement for interim manager Gavin Wilkinson. Though the University of Akron coach will not join Portland until December, the move comes as a welcome relief to Wilkinson and an increasingly disenchanted fan base.</p> <p>An era of good feelings is foreseeable in Portland for the first time in many weeks as a struggling Colorado Rapids side comes to Jeld-Wen Field on Friday night. Last season, the Rapids stole three points in Portland with an injury-time goal from Drew Moor. But Colorado have taken just 7 points from their past 13 games and are only two points clear of Portland on the table. With genuine momentum and an attack that has produced two goals in each of its past three games, the chance to move out of last place is set perfectly for Portland. Questions remain, particularly surrounding Kris Boyd and his future at the club, but for now, all points are good points for the Timbers.</p> <p><strong>Todd Haggerty</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.pidarmy.com\">Pid Army</a>:</p> <p>The last game was a microcosm of this season, score a goal and give up more. 15 minutes where they look good. 75 minutes where they look terrible. It's just been a tough tough season. 16 losses tells its own story and is a record high for the Rapids. As we've said before, they don't know who they are. They're still stuck between playing Gary Smith soccer and possession orientated attacking soccer under Pareja. The big signing this year has been Hendry Thomas, who'll help in stabilizing the midfield, but we're not scoring enough and he doesn't really address that. Bright spots? Tony Cascio's been fairly productive as recent Rapids draft classes have gone. Rivero has shown moments of quality as he adjusts to the league. Other than that...</p> <p>Thankfully they have Portland Timbers coming up who are looking to next year, not this year. Should be a battle of the league's finest... At this point the way the Rapids are playing you can't envision a win so a loss may be on its way.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew vs Montreal, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Ian Fraser</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>The magic is back in Columbus and Federico Higuain is the wizard. Saturday's win at home against NE and the road victory in Philly have rekindled a feeling around the Crew that was ever present in 2008. For a long time Columbus' offense has been an enigma, goals were difficult to come by and the thought of coming from 2 goals down wasn't even an option. Saturday, the Crew were able to do just that and erase a 2 goal deficit before HT only to let NE think they were going to get a draw before promptly scoring on cue again. Fast forward to Wednesday where a 10-man Crew got a late goal to turnaround a 1-0 scoreline on the road. 'Goonies never say die' in SJ but in Columbus we are 'Forever Massive', even in the 95th minute. 5 games unbeaten now with a suddenly dangerous offense (on the run or Higuain set pieces) and the playoff chase is on.<br> Higuain has been magnificent but the offensive production of Arrieta and Gaven shouldn't go unnoticed either. These guys have formed a great chemistry and the rest of the offensive cast is following suit. Saturday is a huge test, Montreal are coming in red hot too. The Crew have been playing tons of games and while they have deep midfield and forward with options to rotate in, the main catalysts Higuain and Arrieta have put in a lot of minutes in the last 2 weeks. After starting 7 straight games with the same back 4, Mendes and Williams figured the only way to get some rest is through injury and suspension. The depth in the defense is not as deep and they will be tested in this game by thier tired legs and Montreal. I know the Impact are on a roll but someting special is going on in Columbus. Not sure if it is something magical or if it is the angel they have watching over them now but I don't expect it to stop Saturday. </p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>They will not stop winning and they will not let go of any playoff hopes. A thorn in many teams' behind, the Montreal Impact took care of business again versus D.C. United, on a hot sunny day at Stade Saputom last weekend. The game started slowly for the home team but even though little space that was given to Patrice Bernier, the local hero took advantage of it. He found Di Vaio who scored a Goal Of The Week candidate and the Impact did not stop at that. With many chances throughout the game, efficiency was an issue but Bernier scored a PK to give a breather to the team. He then (yes him again) finished off D.C United in stoppage time with a long run on the left side to beat Bill Hamid: 3-0 . The quality of play was not the best for the Impact as a whole unit, but different sectors had their moments and the team pulled through.</p> <p>You would think that winning five games in a row would give you the keys to the playoffs. But the race in the East is so tight that no points can be dropped. The next game for Les Bleus will be against the Hot Team hailing from Ohio. The Columbus Crew has found momentum. Arrieta and Higuain have boosted the Crew offense, transforming a defensive sound team into a dangerous machine.</p> <h2>New England Revolution vs Philadelphia Union, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>Things are broken in New England. The squad hasn't won in 9 matches. They consistently keep finding new and unusual ways to let down the fans who actually do make the wretched trip out to soulless Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. They were up by three goals after 21 minutes, only to draw 3-3 at the end of the match. </p> <p>It took the Revs giving away 4,000 free tickets to get their attendance up to 10,495 this past Wednesday. This coming on the same week when the Portland Timbers drew over 14,000 to their RESERVE match. The toxic atmosphere around the stadium is not something that you would want a potential MLS fan to ever encounter. In it's current state, the Stadium isn't even worth the trip for the one-off family attendees that the organization so obviously covets. What is it going to take to make the powers that be wake up and take notice that the Revs are doing far more harm than good to soccer in the region? </p> <p>Sigh.</p> <p>This Saturday the Revs will likely lose (and probably again the following Wednesday). Heaps hasn't showered himself in glory either as of late. He can motivate but he can't make in game tactical adjustments. He doesn't have the experience and doesn't have the staff support to get it right in the first place very often either. </p> <p><strong>Charlie Flowe</strong>, host of <a href=\"http://worldsportsshow.com\">World Sports Show</a> and writer for <a href=\"http://www.PhillySportsLive.com\">www.PhillySportsLive.com</a>:</p> <p>The Philadelphia Union playoff run is unofficially over according to the now permanent Manager John Hackworth, but the Union have their eyes set on 3 points in New England. The last time Philadelphia picked up 3 points was on July 29 when they hosted New England. In that match Philadelphia overcame an early 1-0 deficit and Jack McInerney scored on a 90th minute header to win 2-1. New England controlled the early part of the match, but Philadelphia settled in after conceding a 12th minute goal. The Union played possession style football throughout the rest of the match and ended the game with 59% of the ball control. Philadelphia also completed nearly 160 more passes than the Revs.</p> <p>This weekend, both teams are coming off poor home results as Philadelphia gave up a 94th minute goal to a 10-man Columbus Crew and lost 2-1. While New England blew a early 3-0 lead and finished 3-3 with Chivas USA. The key match up is Philadelphia has the worst offense in the Eastern Conference with 25 goals and New England has one the worst back lines in the MLS. New England's only hope is that their star keeper Matt Reis continues to bail out the defense. Last season when Philadelphia traveled north to face New England it was the \"Carlos Show\" as the Union got early goals from former striker Carlos Ruiz (6') and now captain Carlos Valdes (24'). The match was capped off with a stoppage time goal from Union defender Sheanon Williams, a local product from Boston. Williams actually trained with the Revs for a month in 2009 but they didn't sign him.</p> <h2>Sporting Kansas City vs Toronto FC, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.downthebyline.com/\">Down the Byline</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>For the third time this season Sporting Kansas City kept a team without a shot on goal but unlike the other two games, KC only managed a draw against the New York Red Bulls. While it was a positive result in the way that KC controlled the game against the Red Bulls and kept them, with all their offensive talent (even without Thierry Henry), without a shot on goal. On the other hand it's quite disappointing because KC ended up with only 1 point from their only home game against New York. The loss of two points when KC is trying to catch San Jose for the Supporters' Shield is going to hurt.</p> <p>Sporting welcome bottom of the table Toronto on Saturday. If KC wants to be considered a candidate for the Supporters' Shield and an MLS Cup favorite this is a game they should win going away. Toronto comes in after a midweek game where they gave up 2 goals in stoppage time against Santos. KC will have to make due without two starters. Teal Bunbury is now out for the year after tearing his ACL against New York. Aurelien Collin will also miss the game due to yellow suspension after picking up a card against the Red Bulls. CJ Sapong and Lawrence Olum are the two that would be expected to replace Bunbury and Collin the starting 11. KC though has another worry ahead of the game and that's the continued transfer saga of Roger Espinoza. With plenty of teams looking at him, there's still a chance Espinoza is gone before KC take the field on Saturday. Even without Espinoza, Collin, and Bunbury though, there's enough talent on KC's roster that they should handily beat Toronto at home.</p> <p><strong>Duncan Fletcher</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wakingthered.com/\">Waking the Red</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>Last week saw Toronto FC go to Houston and come away with a very creditable 1-1 draw. The first half saw Houston dominate with their fancy 4-3-3 passing game and TFC were fortunate to be just 1-0 down, though Paul Mariner rather amusingly pronounced it \"the best we've played in a long long time\". Also interviewed at half time was Terry Dunfield, who said \"I think we've got a goal in us in the second half.\" It was Dunfield himself who stepped up and delivered on that threat, heading home when completely unmarked in the box to secure a point that an improved second half just about deserved. Still, that's 6 games without a win, and TFC very much still in last place. They followed that up with a 3-1 midweek loss to Santos Laguna that effectively killed off their hopes of qualifying for the quarter finals, and thus the season's done, with 2 months left.</p> <p>This week it's to Kansas City, who we just played in Toronto 2 weeks ago, a 1-0 defeat that ended with Kei Kamara scoring, then comparing TFC to an English lower division team, apparently Kei doesn't dig the long ball. That game saw an epic game long battle between Eric Hassli and Aurelin Collin, so the news that the French defender is suspended will hopefully make things easier on Hassli. Sporting have had their way with TFC twice this season so far, and TFC have nothing to play for but pride, so I'd expect that to continue. Another defeat, not that it matters. </p> <h2>Real Salt Lake vs D.C. United, Sat 9pm</h2> <p><strong>Matt Montgomery</strong>, <a href=\"http://underthecrossbar.com/\">Under the Crossbar</a>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>It is a strange thing when a 0-0 road draw becomes an uptick in form for Real Salt Lake, but when it comes after three consecutive MLS defeats, it's hard to imagine Jason Kreis isn't pleased. Given the problem so often for the Salt Lake side has been is in team defending, Kreis rolled out a different look for the side \u2014 the first time it's happened in anything near recent memory. With Luis Gil and Javier Morales sharing playmaking duties, and the former applying good midfield pressure, Kreis was able to pull a big chunk of time from Morales, Saborio and others \u2014 all tired after a grueling post-international-duty stretch.</p> <p>Escaping without major injuries from the match, RSL pushes forward to a home match against playoff contenders DC United with their injury problems easing up. Chris Schuler (now a \"probable\" listing, though in need of match fitness) and Jamison Olave (\"questionable\") represent big returns for a defense. This is, of course, is balanced out by an MCL injury to backup left back Kenny Mansally \u2014 you win some, you lose some, as always. With a bit of rest under their belts, Real Salt Lake may well have their hands full with United looking to ensure a chance in the playoffs. With both sides looking to make a strong statement going forward, it has potential to be the sort of late season affair both sets of fans dream of.</p> <p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p> <p>United was in the middle of a stretch of 5 games in two weeks when it visited Montreal on Saturday. So Ben Olsen rested Chris Pontius, Dwayne DeRosario, and Branko Boskovic. Not helping the situation was an illness sidelining Nick DeLeon. As such, the Impact beat a United team that just couldn't catch the breaks on the field (a PK given to Montreal and one not given to United) to compensate for a lack of sharpness. The up and down late summer swing continued back to RFK against New York. Regulars streamed back into the lineup, including Andy Najar moving back to right back to accommodate bringing DeLeon back into the lineup. Najar is a wonderful weapon in the back as he's a tremendous 1-on-1 defender and is a huge threat overlapping on wing. DeRosario scored his 100th MLS goal, but NY tied it late.</p> <p>Salt Lake City is the next stop for United. It's the only meeting of the year between these two teams, and United hasn't done well at Rio Tinto Stadium. United should roll out the same starting lineup that played against New York, for this last of 5 games in two weeks, thanks to the crazy MLS scheduling roulette wheel, United doesn't play again until the 15th of September so there will be a rest period. United needs to build on the positive possession and attack that re-emerged against NY.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Sat 10pm (TSN 2, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Brian Lynch</strong>, <a href=\"http://angelcitybrigade.net/\">Angel City Brigade</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The Galaxy back line came together at home against Dallas this week recording a shutout in a match where the Dallas offense only managed a couple of real threats. Combined with a some major defensive lapses on the part of the visitors this lead to a fairly easy 2-0 win for the team. Should Dunivant have been sent off for denying a clear goal scoring opportunity? Perhaps, and in the end he scored a goal. Poetic justice for Galaxy supporters, or a terrible tragedy for Dallas fans.</p> <p>This week the team plays Vancouver at home, a team the Galaxy have virtually owned. A win and the Galaxy put distance between themselves and the Whitecaps for the fourth spot in the Western Conference, as well as moving closing to securing the third spot and avoiding a play-in game for the playoffs. Wednesday the team played a CCL match against Puerto Rico and fielded almost an entirely reserve team, meaning the A-list team will be primed and ready for Vancouver. Of note, Edson Buddle came off the bench Wednesday night, meaning the Galaxy's attack just got a little bit stronger and deeper. I think it's safe for the rest of MLS to start hating the Galaxy again.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Massey</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.eightysixforever.com\">Eighty Six Forever</a>, Vancouver:</p> <p>The Whitecaps have lost three in a row. One of them was to the team chasing them for the last playoff spot in the Western Conference; the two were to their bitter Cascadian rivals. That... that pretty much sums it up, doesn't it? Martin Rennie's revamped roster is losing all over the place, although it's less the Whitecaps constantly crashing and more everything the opponents strike winding up in the back of the net. An awful run of suspensions, with Darren Mattocks out this week pending appeal to join Gershon Koffie (suspended for Portland) and Barry Robson (suspended for Seattle) isn't helping.</p> <p>So yes, traveling into the Home Depot Center to face the Galaxy is a tall order. Then again, the Galaxy are prone to the occasional total collapse and the last time they met, the Whitecaps badly outplayed Los Angeles despite getting only a point. So one can't rule out the upset quite yet.</p> <h2>Chicago Fire vs Houston Dynamo, Sun 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Stephen Piggott</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/\">Hot Time in Old Town</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeybrothers05\">Whiskey Brothers Aught Five</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>It appeared last week that the Fire were playing DC at just the right time - coming in on a three-match win streak and playing a team that imploded at the end of its last game. Oh how wrong we were. DC got the tactics all right against the Fire and ran out easy winners. DC packed the midfield and didn't allow Chris Rolfe any room to operate. Andy Najar had Patrick Nyarko in his pocket all game and Jalil Anibaba had a howler at right back. DC's win brought the Fire back to earth. </p> <p>Sunday's game against Houston is the biggest of the season, to date. A win puts the Fire two points clear of the Dynamo with a game in hand and gives the team a great chance of pushing for first in the East. Houston's trip to Honduras on Thursday night won't help them but I still expect a tough match. Houston's 4-3-3 is difficult to defend against, especially when you have Brad Davis and Boniek Garcia pulling the strings in the middle. The Fire need to play the way DC did against them - pack the midfield and prevent Davis and Garcia from creating while also being wary of Kandji on the left wing and set pieces where Houston are very strong. If MacDonald can hold the ball up front and the Fire can get the players forward to support him, then we could be in a for a good night. I'd be happy with a draw and a much improved performance in comparison to last week. </p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Another draw at home against a team we definitely should have beaten. I'm just not sure what to say about this one - all respect to Toronto for playing great, but that was not what we've come to expect from the Dynamo. It appears that the playoff race is going to be very tight and could come down to a point or two, if not a tiebreaker. Dropping points at home to one of the worst teams in the conference just don't work for me, but it's better than outright losing I suppose. I don't know, I'm a little vexed and trying not to be too concerned that this team might have peaked a little early.</p> <p>Sorry for the language but this week's match is going to be a bitch. The Dynamo head to Chicago for a huge game with huge playoff implications, just two days after playing in Honduras in the CCL. This will be the ultimate test of this team's roster depth and their ability to bounce back physically and mentally while traveling roughly 7,000 miles in the process. A draw against the Fire really is a must, a win would be a luxury, a loss seems in the cards. Please prove me wrong Dynamo.</p> <h2>FC Dallas vs Seattle Sounders, Sun 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Parrish Glover</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>The roller coaster ride of Dallas's 2012 season won't be ending any time soon. A brilliant week featuring three wins in eight days, including two on the road at teams above us in the table, was followed this past weekend by a frustrating loss at Los Angeles. Like Dallas, LA is a team on the rise, and they've had our number once before as the Hoops have challenged for a playoff spot.</p> <p>Lone Star supporters aren't sure which is more maddening about the recent disappointment - that the darling of the league got away with a red card challenge on the last man in the 14th minute, or that the defender who committed the offence turned out to be the eventual goal-scorer. I personally try not to lay too much on the officials, but the Galaxy get all the breaks, including a mid-season rules change that seems designed to improve LA's potential playoff route.</p> <p>The road to November football continues this weekend with a home tilt against the Seattle Sounders. A win would potentially put FCD a mere two points back of the final playoff spot with five to play (the team ahead of us, Vancouver, faces the Galaxy in LA). The road loss was a setback, and one of the few we can endure in the closing weeks of the season, but hope is not lost and supporters in the north end remain united in belief that we still have breath in a year that appeared all but lost just two months ago.</p> <p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.sounderatheart.com \"\">Sounder at Heart</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Things are about as good as they can be in Sounder-land. The offense is kicking, as Montero's hattrick puts both he and Johnson into the top 9 for MLS goals on the season. Mauro Rosales was a fringe MVP candidate in 2011, only held back by injury. Now healthy he already matches his assist total in his Newcomer of the Year season. Even the defense is good. While many seem to focus on the gaffes it is a D that does not give up goals (2nd in MLS).</p> <p>But on Sunday they face some familiar challenges. Dallas is back to being a decent team. It's almost as if losing an MVP caliber player and then getting him back is something that matters. Not only that, but the Sounders are in the middle of the longest road trip in their history, as their CONCACAF Champions League match is in Trinidad. Upon arriving in Dallas prior to the match a vast majority of the team will have flown about 6000 miles in less than a week. If there's any good news, it's that Seattle is used to travel and the weather in Trinidad is more like Dallas than the weather in Seattle. Sigi Schmid will be challenged to use his deep roster to the greatest effect. A win over Dallas will push Seattle into the 3rd spot on the overall table and gain space on the West Play-In teams.</p> <h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs Chivas USA, Sun 9pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.centerlinesoccer.com \"\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Last weekend the San Jose Earthquakes faced the Rapids and found out that they were only really Class 1 ripples. With 3 of San Jose's main starters (Steven Lenhart, Victor Bern\u00e1rdez, &amp; Jason Hernandez) out due to suspensions and a super-sub Shea Salinas sidelined with a hamstring strain, fans were a bit nervous to see how their team would show and Hunter Freeman and Marvell Wynne both were effective in shutting down Golden Boot leader Chris Wondolowski. But Saturday night San Jose, proving they are no longer that one dimensional team which must depend on Wondo for all their goals, showcased their depth with both Simon Dawkins and Alan Gordon netting braces, and Gordon assisting with Dawkins first goal. All the while, the Quakes' makeshift backline of Corrales, Morrow, Opara, Beitashour and Busch only allowed 3 shots on target, one of which was Tyrone Marshall's second goal of the season. Quakes were happy to get their 9th home win of the season, net their 52nd goal and be the first team to reach 50 points this season.</p> <p>Now it's time to turn towards Sunday's game against Chivas USA. The Goats are coming off of a 6 - 2 loss against Seattle and then a crazy midweek game in New England, where they they went down by 3 goals and clawed their way back to earn a point. Dan Kennedy has been stellar between the pipes, but various defensive gaffes have given Chivas a -15 goal differential and placed them 7th in the West. Before Wednesday evening's match, Chivas USA, as a team, had scored less goals than Chris Wondolowski. </p> <p>The last time these two teams met up it was a Mother's Day afternoon 1 - 1 draw (played without the Honduran National Team key players Victor Bern\u00e1rdez and Marvin Ch\u00e1vez). I expect that the offensive firepower of Gordon, Lenhart, Wondo, and Dawkins will keep this game interesting and high scoring; while Morrow, Bern\u00e1rdez, Corrales, Beitashour and Cronin will lock down the defense. I think another 6 - 1 rout could be in the making this Sunday night.</p> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>On Wednesday, Chivas USA went to the East Coast and tied the New England Revolution 3-3. The game started badly, as Chivas went down 3-0 just after 20 minutes, but a brace from Shalrie Joseph, returning to the stadium where he had spent nearly all of his career, helped the Goats get back into the match. On one hand, a draw was a good result considering the deficit they faced, and the fact that they haven't scored three goals in a game all year. But it was also a major disappointment, as they are squandering their games in hand and it looks like the playoffs are out of reach in 2012.</p> <p>On Sunday, Chivas travel north to take on the San Jose Earthquakes. In their first encounter, they drew 1-1, so Chivas have shown they can hang with the best team in the league this season. Can they do it twice, or maybe even grab the win? In this league, anything can happen, but Chivas' form has been awful on the defensive end lately, and that bodes ill for this match, considering the attacking firepower the Quakes possess. Still, the team is fighting for pride, dignity, and probably even their jobs at this point, so a win is certainly possible.</p> <p><em>You've read what our panel says - what do you think is going to happen in this weekend's games?

  "<p>If this was revolution, it was a remarkably calm affair. When the man sometimes billed as Spain's most dangerous leftwing politician, Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo, led his utopian army of marchers through the baking southern heat into the small town of Albolote, the biggest fuss was among those jostling for photographs beside the charismatic revolutionary.</p> <p>Riot police stood by, but the 500-odd tired, sweaty marchers simply dropped their banners, flopped under the cool trees of the town's Guaynabo Park and reached for their water bottles.</p> <p>Gordillo's reputation as a modern-day Robin Hood has grown this summer after a series of \"workers' marches\" across southern Andaluc\u00eda saw followers raid food from two supermarkets and hand it to the poor.</p> <p>Flash occupations of bank branches and an empty luxury country hotel have kept his small Andalucian Workers' Union in the headlines as debate rages about a style of direct action that attracts those seeking radical change to Spain's current diet of soaring unemployment, recession and harsh austerity.</p> <p>\"The right likes to make out that we are a dangerous bunch of criminals, a sort of modern Pancho Villa,\" bearded Gordillo said, his trademark Palestinian-style keffiyeh scarf hanging in immaculate folds. \"But that is the same strategy as always. First they criminalise you and then they try to get rid of you.\"</p> <p>After more than half a dozen arrests over three decades spent fighting for the rights of landless Andalucian labourers, 60-year-old Gordillo will not be easily put off his latest crusade.</p> <p>While the marchers ate and snoozed, staff at the Mercadona supermarket just around the corner were clearly nervous. A guard armed with a baton admitted that security had been beefed up. Armed police were parked across the street.</p> <p>Ever since Gordillo' s marchers took a dozen trolleys of food from a Mercadona in Ecija on 7 August, their presence has provoked concern that \u2013 even though they are avowedly peaceful \u2013 trouble might break out.</p> <p>\"If they are taking to give to the poor, then I think that is great,\" said Antonio Mart\u00ednez, an Albolote pensioner who applauded the marchers as they reached the midpoint of a two-day, 20-mile march.</p> <p>Prosecutors do not seem to agree. Gordillo, who has been mayor of the country town of Marinaleda for the past 33 years and is a deputy in the regional Andalucian parliament, expects to be formally charged. \"I wasn't in the supermarket, but they say I encouraged them,\" he said. He and seven others reportedly face prison sentences of up to five years.</p> <p>Gordillo and his lieutenant Diego Ca\u00f1amero insist that the supermarket raids at Ecija and in nearby Arcos were symbolic. The idea had been to highlight how, instead, the rich are now stealing from the poor.</p> <p>\"This is the biggest rip-off in the history of capitalism,\" said Gordillo. \"The banks created huge amounts of private debt which went toxic. Now they are using public money, taken from the poor, to rescue them. That is what the cuts to health and education are about.</p> <p>\"We want to show that this crisis has a human face. People are losing everything \u2013 their jobs, their homes, and some don't even have enough to eat.\"</p> <p>The marchers' ranks have now been swollen by Spaniards arriving from outside Andaluc\u00eda. \"We've spent a few days in Marinaleda, seeing how things can be done differently,\" explained Yanira Bratos, from the northern city of Aranda del Duero. \"And now we wanted to join the march.\"</p> <p>Gordillo's protest movement chimes with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/13/spain-protests-indignados-first-anniversary\" title=\"\">peaceful indignado protesters</a> who filled city squares last year. Indignado T-shirts abound, along with Republican flags and a banner bearing the face of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. \"The situation is critical and I think there is now a chance of change. The system cannot resolve people's problems,\" said Gordillo.</p> <p>Unlike other preachers of change, Gordillo has both a track record and a shop window for the movement's achievements in Marinaleda.</p> <p>His election in 1979 appalled conservatives and former Francoists in a country which, only four years earlier, had been ruled by the dictator General Francisco Franco. At a local level he has led landless labourers into occupying, and eventually winning control of, estates owned by absent aristocrats and has also overseen a system of self-built homes.</p> <p>Now Gordillo is back on the national stage. He is invited on to mainstream television debate shows and the conservative press is, once more, outraged. What has changed? \"Unemployment in Spain is 25%, but in Andaluc\u00eda it is 35%,\" he explained. \"And in some places we have visited it is close to 50%.\"</p> <p>Marchers admit they get mixed reactions. \"I have seen old women weep when we arrive,\" explained Bratos.</p> <p>In some places, however, shops are shuttered up and insults hurled. \"I don't understand why other working people have been so rude, or why some shops close,\" complained Eva Berm\u00fadez, a jobbing farm worker from Marinaleda. \"I have heard people call us thieves, bastards and sons of bitches.\"</p> <p>As Spain's recession deepens the Andalucian Workers' Union, and its methods, look set to become more popular. \"These people are peaceful,\" said Mart\u00ednez. \"But if things get worse I can see others turning to violence.\"</p>",
  "<p>As our TVs have got bigger and flatter, the one thing that's suffered has been the sound.</p> <p>The picture quality just keeps getting better and better, as the resolution keeps getting higher. But the thinner the screen, the poorer the speakers.</p> <p>Which is why the rise of the flat-screen TV has seen a boom in the sale of home theatre speaker packages.</p> <p>But the Bose VideoWave Entertainment System neatly manages to fit everything into the one box \u2013 a great-looking 1080p LCD flatscreen HDTV with a 5.1 surround-sound speaker system built in.</p> <p>OK, to be totally fair, it's not exactly a \"flat\" screen. While it's certainly not the size of an old CRT TV set (remember them?), it's nowhere near the slimline proportions of today's ultra-thin models that make Kate Moss look like John Goodman.</p> <p>The set's depth runs at a not-too-hefty 5.5in (14cm) for the 55in model and 5.9in (15.2cm) for the 46in model. The 55in screen weighs in at 60kg, with the 46in a touch lighter at 48.1kg.</p> <p>The screen resolution is 1920 x 1080p, with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a refresh rate of 100Hz. The TV does come with a stand, but despite the weight, and depth, it can be wall mounted.</p> <p>As modern TVs go, it's not going to win any design awards \u2013 the rather plain-looking black set would look quite out of place in an Apple Store. But it's when it's switched on that the Bose screen shines. The picture quality is superb, and the matte screen is reasonably non-reflective, which gives a great viewing experience.</p> <p>But with Bose, it's all about the sound, and the VideoWave's major selling point is the built-in speakers. There are seven all up \u2013 six high-performance woofers and a proprietary acoustic waveguide. The sound is amazing, exactly what you'd expect to get from a decent component home theatre system.</p> <p>The sound is crisp and clear, with plenty of rumbling base when needed \u2013 and you do get the true 5.1 surround sound experience. So the beauty of this setup is that you can get a true home theatre setup without the need for multiple speakers and wires running all over your living room.</p> <p>The VideoWave screen is simply a slave \u2013 with all those speakers inside, there is no room for a tuner, or anything else. The cabinet has just two connectors \u2013 one for the power supply, and one for the control console that runs the system.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the console doesn't have a TV tuner in it either, which means that you need to plug a separate digital set-top box into it.</p> <p>The console measures 15.5in x 9.5in x3.1in and controls all the separate components, from the digital box through to DVD and Blu-ray players as well as games consoles and even your computer.</p> <p>The control deck lets you hook up quite a bit of kit to it. The rear panel has three HDMI inputs, two high-definition component A/V inputs and one USB input. The front panel has one HDMI input, one analogue A/V input, one USB input for photo viewing only and a 1 headphone jack.</p> <p>All this is controlled by a single, stripped back remote. It has just six main buttons on it \u2013 on/off, source selector, volume control, channel change, mute and last channel.</p> <p>What it does have in the middle is a click pad, much like those on the early iPods. As you use it, all the functions appear in a frame around the edge of the screen, meaning that you never need to look away from the TV to change channel, or source, or fast forward through a movie.</p> <p>The remotes for all your other devices sync to it, making it simple to control everything with just the one device. But this is where I encountered a few problems.</p> <p>For a start, my Blu-ray player is a PlayStation 3, which uses a Bluetooth remote \u2013 and hence it won't sync to the infrared Bose controller. I also have a rather obscure brand set-top box, which did sync to the remote, but not completely \u2013 some of the functions were missing.</p> <p>I also found the touchpad a little over-sensitive, which made it hard to precisely choose a function. All of which means that I tended to use my separate remotes for TV viewing and watching movies on DVD or Blu-ray.</p> <p>Still, it's a minor annoyance for such an impressive home entertainment setup. The VideoWave even comes with an iPod/iPhone dock to listen to your music when there's nothing to watch on TV.</p> <p>The big sticking point will probably be the price \u2013 it's not the cheapest telly on the market.</p> <p>The VideoWave system with a 46in screen is \u00a33,800. The new VideoWave II system is \u00a34,700 for the 46in model and \u00a35,500 for the 55in model.</p> <p>When you consider that a standard 46in flatscreen TV will set you back about \u00a3600, then yes, it's a lot of money to pay. But if you're looking to buy a brand new HDTV along with a home theatre setup, then the Bose VideoWave is certainly worth a test drive.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Exceptional sound quality and picture; home-cinema quality without all those annoying wires.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The price; glitchy remote; the lack of a TV tuner.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bose.co.uk/GB/en/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Bose.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>TonConoboy: </strong>Is your application of myth essentially positive about humanity, or do you ascribe to the notion that myths reveal a darkness in the soul of man?</p> <p><strong>Alan Garner: </strong>Yes, to both.</p> <p><strong>GalleyBeggars:</strong> I read once that you don't like to reread your own books. First, is that right? And if so, why? Following on from that, did you have to reread The Weirdstone of Brisingamen to write Boneland? I ask particularly because I know you once said you didn't think it was a particularly good book and I'm wondering if you've changed your mind \u2026</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>I don't reread, unless I have to (eg for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338632/\" title=\"\">adapting The Owl Service</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331614/\" title=\"\">Red Shift for television</a>). Once my duty to the text is finished and it's published, I've no interest in looking at those words for the nth time. The book must find its own way. I have to move on.</p> <p><strong>BryanFerry: </strong> British oral traditions are clearly important to you. You seem to have become our most prominent curator and champion of folk tales with your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/14/collected-folk-tales-garner-review\" title=\"\">editorship of anthologies</a>, and written contributions to the field (I loved Yallery Brown). And of course your novels, both children and adult, that draw on this mythology. My question: why do you think such a big chunk of British cultural heritage has come to be so overlooked and neglected?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>Hard to answer in brief. Some of the reasons are the breaking up of rural communities and the diaspora into cities as a result of the industrial revolution; the watering down of traditional tales for use, and control, in the nursery; the appropriation by scholars, resulting in arid prose not intended for an audience. There's much more at work. Yet hope lies in the modern movement of oral professional storytelling. There's sap in't yet.</p> <p><strong>FatherHackett: </strong>The Trickster figure is important in your work (not just explicitly in the Guizer but implicitly in characters such as Tom in Red Shift and in many of your shorter works). How much of a Trickster is the Author? Where does the play of meaning and appearance end, or is it all seamless?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>The Author IS Trickster. The play of meaning and appearance should be seamless. I unwittingly spend a lot of time and energy on this.</p> <p><strong>Galabackhome: </strong>The stories are strongly rooted in the places they are set. Are these places that have special personal meaning to you prior to the story; or is it the myth associated with the place that breeds the story?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>Place comes first, and the rest is exposed, as if in an archaeological dig.</p> <p><strong>Jericho999:</strong> What do you think about Alderley Edge nowadays? Does its reputation as a Wag paradise change your feeling about the place?</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> Alderley Edge has always been a fake. Its real name is Chorley, which didn't suit the textile barons of Manchester (<a href=\"http://www.alderleyedge.manchester.museum/popup_maint.php?res_id=210&amp;img=1&amp;bg=0\" title=\"\">Lord Stanley called them \"the Cottontots\"</a>), who came with the advent of the railway in 1841. It's a place that has always attracted new money. The difference in the 19th century was that some of the commercial families were philanthropic and cultured. That doesn't apply now. The old, working and craft families, from whom I come, occupy the same geographical co-ordinates but not the same world. \"We\" let \"Them\" get on with being transient. Welsh has a definition of the kind of people to whom I belong, which translates as \"a man of his square mile\". We know our place.</p> <p><strong>Monkeynotdonkey:</strong> One of the things that really fascinated me and also slightly disturbed me when I read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780007274789/elidor\" title=\"\">Elidor</a> as a boy was the sense that the entire mythology appeared to have sprung complete and fully formed from nowhere. It didn't fit with my then quite limited knowledge of myths and legends. As I've grown up I've recognised elements of the tale in existing folklore. How important was it to create an independent mythology for Elidor, and how much of it was drawn from other sources?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>The background to Elidor is an amalgam of linked pre-existing mythological themes (all myth pre-exists), which I wove into a tapestry of story.</p> <p><strong>Imogen Russell Wiliams:</strong> I was amazed and heartened, as a great fan and fellow sufferer, to discover you had been diagnosed with manic depression during your career. How much has bipolar disorder hindered you in your work, and has it helped you at all?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>I am not qualified to comment, and it would be irresponsible of me to try.</p> <p><strong>SimonNorrton:</strong> Growing up in Cheshire, the Edge, its legend and your stories were a hugely influential part of my childhood and teenage years \u2013 as they have been for so many others \u2013 and coming back to the stories once again in anticipation of Boneland has revealed new layers of meaning for me, particularly through your <a href=\"http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/oxford-literary-festival-2010-seven-firs-and-goldenstone-account-legend-alderley-video\" title=\"\">By Seven Firs and Goldenstone</a> paper. May I take this opportunity too, to express my appreciation of your work. I've recently completed a masters degree and focused in part on fairytale and storytelling and your work has brought \"my/our\" local story that much closer to my heart. Thank you.</p> <p>I wondered how recent archaeological work at the Edge had added to your understanding of the area. I wonder if there might be a relationship between the Sleepers and the Barrows.</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> Thank you. The By Seven Firs and Goldenstone paper is the only truly original work I've done, and even there I missed an important trick, which I've now incorporated in the revised, but not yet republished, monograph.</p> <p>You've got it back to front. It was my understanding of the Edge that led, after 40 years of badgering the academics, to the proof of the archaeology.</p> <p><strong>DebbiUK:</strong> I've always wondered if Findhorn had to die because Helen broke the jug.</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>Traditionally, the unicorn can be caught only when it lays its head in the lap of a virgin. The jug is up to the reader to interpret.</p> <p><strong>AllanFrewinJones:</strong> I've been a reader of your work since I was awarded Weirdstone for good attendance at Sunday school when I was 10. I was inspired to become a writer by reading your books and I now have them on audio CD as well as in hardback. As a children's writer, I go to schools from time to time, and I always tell children to seek out your books. A friend texted me last week, asking which of your books I would recommend to a 12-year-old boy. I said, if he's interested in girls, give him The Owl Service, if not, Weirdstone. Here's my question: do you write with a specific external audience in mind, or you you write primarily to produce work that (temporarily at least) pleases and fulfills your own muse/intent? Or, to put it another way: is an external audience integral to your work?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>At the time of the writing, the external audience is unknowable and has no influence on me or the work.</p> <p><strong>Alberich: </strong>Alan, was there any specific inspiration for the Mara in The Weirdstone of Brisingamen? I've always found their first brief appearance one of the most haunting and terrifying passages in literature. And do they reappear in the third book?</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=AsS&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;biw=1646&amp;bih=917&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvnso&amp;tbnid=W7nzbw13chLWsM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://lisathatcher.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/henry-moore-art-sculpture-and-the-reclining-figure/&amp;imgurl=http://lisathatcher.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/h2_1995-600.jpg&amp;w=500&amp;h=348&amp;ei=34o_UNWgFs2QhQfDhYHwAQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=351&amp;vpy=298&amp;dur=7964&amp;hovh=187&amp;hovw=269&amp;tx=178&amp;ty=122&amp;sig=114423198638524523726&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=136&amp;tbnw=155&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=36&amp;ved=1t:429,r:8,s:0,i:98\" title=\"\">Henry Moore's sculptures of reclining women</a> scared, and still scare, me.</p> <p><strong>Palparadise: </strong>I was wondering if there are \u2013 other than Alderley Edge \u2013 subjects, areas of interest, both physical and psychological (in its loosest sense) that are important to you, particularly in regards to your writing of fiction?</p> <p>On reflection this sounds like such a horribly narrow-minded question, considering the themes and subject matter you involve your readers in. Sorry about that. What I mean to ask is whether you have any interest in taking your characters to other places, beyond folklore, beyond myth, legend \u2026 Is there a beyond? I'm not sure. Crikey, I've not made myself clear at all but I can't seem to delete my original question.</p> <p>I love your fiction; it's been/is very important to me. Thank you.</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> I find your question hard to understand. But there is no beyond.</p> <p><strong>Lord Snooty 12:</strong> I apologise for asking three questions, but you don't have to answer all of them.</p> <p>What do you think you would have done with your life if the WOB had stayed in the slush pile?</p> <p>I find it interesting that The Owl Service was published in the UK in the same month that Sergeant Pepper was released. There was clearly an enormous surge of creativity at the time. What's your verdict on the 60s?</p> <p>How many plates with The Owl Service design have you come across over the years?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>I'd have carried on writing. There is no option. It's not a job but a condition.</p> <p>I was too busy to notice the 60s, or any other decade. The genesis of an undoubted release of creativity into all areas of society was the 1944 Education Act; which enabled me to have a free education at a fine grammar school, and a free education at one of Oxford's best colleges.</p> <p>Five. The designer was recently identified as <a href=\"http://designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser\" title=\"\">Christopher Dresser</a>.</p> <p><strong>Cazzaminx: </strong>Boneland \u2013 why now? Simple question, but I've been imagining all manner of possibilities. Can't wait.</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> Because that's how long it took. The other books had to be written first. Essentially, the nine novels are all one work.</p> <p><strong>Redridinghood19: </strong>My question is about the act of writing, creating a story in your mind. Do you find that stories \u2013 the best stories \u2013 simply spring up in front of you, almost fully formed?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>Every writer has to discover their own way to write. In my case the sensation is that the stories find me. If I were to go looking (which I don't) they'd not be there. Experience has convinced me that the conscious mind is a fine editor and critic, but is entirely unoriginal. Creativity is the product of the unconscious. I \"see\", \"watch\", \"listen\", and write it down, with no intellectual planning. What happens is as new to me as it is to the reader. It's also essential, for me, to read the text aloud. If it jars the ear it will jar the mind.</p> <p><strong>Thackur: </strong>Your writing style is famously economical with words and carefully crafted. Indeed the theme of craftsmanship is crucial in works such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Book_Quartet\" title=\"\">Stone Book Quartet</a>. So is a lot of your time spent revising and honing individual sentences \u2013 do you write \"like Alan Garner\" quite naturally or is it a matter of a lot of hard graft in the workshop, chiselling away at the sentences, with a lot of words ending up on the cutting-room floor (to mix my metaphors in a very un-Garner-like way)?</p> <p>In similar vein, is a lot of the writer's art knowing what to leave out, so drawing in the reader's own imagination to fill the gaps? There's something wonderfully sinister about the unseen mother character in The Owl Service.</p> <p>I'm interested to see <a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Jodrell Bank</a> taking a central role in the new book. I've always thought of it as an unmentioned presence in Red Shift, which seems to me like a series of distorted transmissions from across great distances of time and space, picked up in (or originating from) modern day Cheshire. Has it always been as much part of your imaginative landscape as the ancient folklore, having this great device for listening to the universe sitting on your doorstep?</p> <p>Very excited about the new book \u2026 Thanks.</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>Every word has to beg for its life. Adverbs and adjectives are born guilty until proved innocent. When something is \"finished\", I cut it back, and continue until what is said can be said in no fewer words. This leads to clarity and impact, and also to an extra dramatic effect when the rule is broken and the words appear to run riot. They don't. They're on a strong leash. (There are examples of this in Boneland.)</p> <p>The reader will benefit from having to engage actively, too. If I've got it anywhere near right, each encounter with the text will provoke a creative response and interpretation in the reader that may not be there for me because I've not had that reader's experiences.</p> <p>I've lived less than a mile from Jodrell Bank for 55 years. I'd have to be made of granite for that not to have had an effect. The <a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/\" title=\"\">Lovell telescope </a>is one of the world's great works of art. And totally functional.</p> <p><strong>Sam: </strong>I've been reading Boneland and have found it a very hard read \u2013 in the best sense of that term. It's raw, vivid and hits you right in the gut, on an emotional level. I'm wondering if it was also especially difficult to write. I know writing never comes easily \u2013 but did this one hurt more than others?</p> <p><strong>AG: </strong>Thanks for the compliment that counts. Every book's the hardest yet, but this one IS the hardest.</p>",
  "<p>Zadie Smith has described local libraries as \"absolutely essential\" as campaigners in the UK battle to protect the hundreds of branches which are under threat of closure.</p> <p>Speaking on Radio 5 Live on 30 August, Smith said that she owed her \"whole life to books and libraries\". The novelist, who joined campaigners fighting to save Kensal Rise library in Brent, said that \"like a lot of kids in this country, if you don't have middle-class, educated parents you need to find ways to get books. A lot of people don't have books on their shelves. The library was the place I went to find out what there was to know. It was absolutely essential.\"</p> <p>Figures from the <a href=\"http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/about-public-libraries-news/information\" title=\"\">Public Library News website</a>, which monitors library closures in the UK, show that 245 libraries (209 buildings and 36 mobiles) are currently either under threat, have been closed or left council control over the last year, out of the UK's 4,000-plus public libraries. These range from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/leeds/2011/may/19/council-presses-ahead-with-leeds-library-plans\" title=\"\">13 branch closures in Leeds</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/districtnews/districtatog/9591842.Sunday_and_bank_holiday_opening_for_Central_Library/\" title=\"\">five in Bolton</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/communitymanagedlibraries\" title=\"\">transfer of 12 branches to volunteers in Warwickshire</a>.</p> <p>In Smith's borough of Brent, six libraries have been closed by the council, but campaigners are still continuing to fight. An appeal is underway to <a href=\"http://www.savekensalriselibrary.org/\" title=\"\">raise \u00a370,000 to save Kensal Rise library</a>, with \u00a336,128 pledged so far and a deadline of 7 September. Volunteers are currently preparing their bid for the building's owner, All Soul's College in Oxford, to see if they will be permitted to run the building as a community library.</p> <p>The novelist criticised the politicisation of the library debate. \"When we were children, you'd never imagine that you'd get into a right/left argument about the purpose and use of a library. It seems extraordinary to me,\" she said. \"I really don't find it a political argument. It's about equality of opportunity. You know you don't expect everyone to be as educated as everyone else or have the same achievements but you expect at least to be offered at least some of the opportunities and libraries are the most simple and the most open way to give people access to books.\"</p> <p>Library supporters, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/12/library-closures-protest-houses-parliament\" title=\"\">who lobbied MPs about closures in March this year along with authors including Kate Mosse and Philip Ardagh</a>, are now planning a conference this November at which they will hammer out the ways in which the battle to save libraries can continue.</p> <p>\"Libraries are vital to every society in every culture. They don't discriminate. They don't care if you are rich or poor, well read or can't read a word. Saving&#xa0;libraries&#xa0;is about more than waiting until the local council decides on cuts. Saving libraries is making sure the public&#xa0;recognise&#xa0;they should use the resources before they [are threatened]. The <a href=\"http://www.speakupforlibraries.org/index.asp\" title=\"\">Speak Up For Libraries [conference]</a> is to provide a larger voice for those who feel they are on their own,\" said campaigner Mar Dixon, who is helping organise the conference. \"The idea is to empower library campaigners (from small villages to large cities across the country) with knowledge on their rights and options to save libraries.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Bath</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Gary Gold</p> <p>Expect something very different this season. The \"Bath way\" has not won much silverware of late so their ambitious owner, Bruce Craig, has turned to the disciplined South African approach of Gold \u2013 one of the coaches associated with that great Springbok era between 2007 and 2010. Last season Bath were probably a coach short. This time Gold has a galaxy in tow, plus a trainer in Allan Ryan who will guarantee peak fitness \u2013 word is that pre-season has been tough. There have been a couple of clever front-row signings in Paul James from the Ospreys and Rob Webber of Wasps.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 8th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 8th</p> <h2><strong>Exeter</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Rob Baxter</p> <p>Can the dream continue? Why not? In fact I see no reason why the third season in the Premiership should not be&#xa0;the best yet. Given the wonderful rugby catchment area at Baxter's disposal, plus two good \"feeder\" clubs in Plymouth Albion and Cornish Pirates,&#xa0;a great match-day experience, the coach's ability to tease the best out players like James Scaysbrook and&#xa0;Haydn Thomas, plus seemingly sound finances, there is no reason why&#xa0;Exeter should not become a power&#xa0;in the land. However, this time&#xa0;Baxter has to fight on a new front&#xa0;\u2013&#xa0;the Heineken Cup \u2013 which will test his resources.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 5th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 5th</p> <h2><strong>Gloucester</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Nigel Davies</p> <p>Add Llanelli flair to the Gloucester ethos and the result could be potent. Davies, a coach whose Llanelli teams always seemed to figure in try-of-the-season footage, takes over from the more disciplined Bryan Redpath. Import Billy Twelvetrees from Leicester to play outside the fly-half Freddie Burns plus the former All Black No9 Jimmy Cowan to feed the ammunition to a lightning back line and Kingsholm should be an exciting place. Familiar faces like Luke Narraway, Al Strokosch and Rory Lawson have moved on but, like his coach, Ben Morgan has joined from the Scarlets.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 8th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 7th</p> <h2><strong>Harlequins</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Conor O'Shea</p> <p>The champions will be the team to beat and the burden will be greater. O'Shea has not gone heavily into the transfer market and increased Test demands will reflect last season's success. It is also worth remembering last season's flying start while some players were away at the World Cup. However, Quins have an academy that provides depth \u2013 the second XV are always a tough nut \u2013 and you have to admire the way they stick by their values. Teams unfamiliar with success have been known to panic and tighten up at the sharp end of the season. Quins, after a tense semi-final, took their short-passing game through to a fine win in the Grand Final.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> Champions</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 2nd</p> <h2><strong>Leicester</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Richard Cockerill</p> <p>One of the few predictions I'm prepared to make about this season is that Leicester will be involved in the Grand Final. But when aren't they? They have strengths in important areas \u2013 like tighthead prop \u2013 that other clubs would die for and have been clever in the transfer market. Once the World Cup was out of their system, Leicester were close to unbeatable last season, scoring 70 tries. That was 17 more than Harlequins and suggests a heritage that should reboot new boy Miles Benjamin's England ambitions. Mind you, there were also times \u2013 Ulster, Clermont and the Grand Final \u2013 when their defence needed attention.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 2nd</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> Champions</p> <h2><strong>London Irish</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Brian Smith</p> <p>Like a handful of clubs below the big three or four and above London Welsh and perhaps Worcester, London Irish start the season unsure what the months up to Christmas hold. Some old heads like Nick Kennedy, Bob Casey, Delon Armitage, Kieran Roche and Faan Rautenbach have left and we could also have done without the pre\u2011season injury to Joe Ansbro, who is important to our defensive plans. However, Smith is back and has made some bright signings. He is determined that youth is the way to go and he has been right before.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 7th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 10th</p> <h2><strong>London Wasps</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Dai Young</p> <p>No excuses this time. The squad are really strong, particularly in the back row and I can see them back in the top six and qualifying for the Heineken Cup. Rob Hoadley's move to coach in Japan was a loss but a second-row partnership of Marco Wentzel and Tom Palmer should guarantee plenty of lineout steals. The arrival of Stephen Jones, such a positive person, is good news for everyone at Wasps but particularly those on a learning curve. A couple of early wins and Christian Wade back on song \u2013 when he plays Wasps tend to win&#xa0;\u2013 and who knows?</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 11th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 9th</p> <h2><strong>London Welsh</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Lyn Jones</p> <p>Sides promoted from the Championship are always dealt a difficult hand, but London Welsh suffered more than most from the delays that going to law caused. They won that battle and they are going to need to win a lot more to stay up. Most of Jones's transfer targets will have gone elsewhere but he has done well snapping up Sonny Parker and Neil Briggs and deserved better luck than a fractured cheek after going for Gavin Henson. He is someone I've always rated because he has always done well by me, never being anything less than professional.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> Promoted</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 12th</p> <h2><strong>Northampton</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Jim Mallinder</p> <p>Must be looking for a home semi-final at the very least. Up front they have a huge set piece and the new boy Dominic Waldouck, whose career has stalled over the past couple of seasons, will thrive on quality ball. Saints' problem since Paul Grayson retired has been continuity at fly-half, the job being shared again last season by Ryan Lamb and Stephen Myler. Sides who succeed tend to have continuity at half-back. That said, they gave Harlequins a fright in the semi-final last season and were very much in the game until the death.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 4th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 4th</p> <h2><strong>Sale</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Bryan Redpath</p> <p>Rugby thrives on its characters, which is one of many reasons to welcome the return of Danny Cipriani after two seasons with Melbourne. Sale have never been easy to beat on a Friday night under lights but with a new stadium and players like Cipriani and a potential Lion such as Richie Gray there is every reason to suggest a real head of steam building in the north-west. The chemistry will be interesting. Redpath, back where he played, likes a disciplined style but Cipriani, with the comfort of Dwayne Peel inside him, will want to be less predictable.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 5th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 6th</p> <h2><strong>Saracens</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Mark McCall</p> <p>Saracens will see plenty of the world \u2013 Twickenham, Salford, Wembley, Murrayfield, and even the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels \u2013 before they settle in their new home at Hendon. That's not until mid-February and, for a side who pride themselves on doing the little things well, it's adding to the burden. They will also miss Andy Farrell but against that they have signed Chris Ashton, the best support player in world rugby, and Charlie Hodgson's decision to give up Test rugby won't hurt. When others are away for the autumn internationals and Six Nations, having a Test No10 available every week is good news.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 3rd</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 3rd</p> <h2><strong>Worcester</strong></h2> <p><strong>Head coach</strong> Richard Hill</p> <p>If having Phil Larder around to coach defence and stem the tries when it really mattered was the secret to safety last season, then word is that Mathieu Rourre may be the man to do the trick this time around by adding more firepower. With Phil Vickery and Nigel Redman looking after the forwards, Rourre, a long-time friend of Hill and once coach of France Under-19s and the Biarritz Academy, has been called in to inspire Worcester's underachieving attack who, to compound things, have also lost two talented wings in Marcel Garvey and Miles Benjamin.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 10th</p> <p><strong>Guardian prediction</strong> 11th</p>",
  "<p>From Saturday, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/09/bankers-protesters-squatters-cameron\" title=\"\">massively unjust</a>, unnecessary and unaffordable <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19429936\" title=\"\">new law</a> will come into force in England and Wales. In the middle of one of the worst housing crises this country has ever seen, up to 50,000 squatters who are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/squatting\" title=\"\">currently squatting</a> in empty properties across the UK face becoming criminals, and this because they are occupying abandoned residential properties to put a roof over their heads.</p> <p>Of course, we have all heard the horror stories of the innocent homeowner who \"goes out to buy a pint of milk and comes back to find their home squatted\" \u2013 and we have sympathy with this situation. But most people don't realise that such instances are extremely rare and overplayed in the media for political gain. They are also already a criminal offence, and homeowners are already strongly protected by existing legislation. One hundred and sixty leading legal figures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/sep/25/squatting-law-media-politicians\" title=\"\">wrote to the Guardian</a> to explain this point.</p> <p>In the face of this new law, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/charities-end-squatters-rights-homelessness\" title=\"\">thousands of vulnerable people</a> will possibly become criminals overnight, facing up to six months in jail and fines of up to \u00a35,000. With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/08/homelessness-jumps-repossession-unemployment\" title=\"\">homelessness rates rising</a> and the number of empty properties currently in the region of <a href=\"http://www.emptyhomes.com/statistics-2/\" title=\"\">more than 930,000</a> according to the Empty Homes Agency, we must ask: who is this law protecting? It protects unscrupulous landlords and property speculators who are keeping properties empty to up their profits. The new law encourages these properties to remain empty and is worryingly open to abuse by rogue landlords, which could mean trouble for tenants.</p> <p>96% of responses to the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/consultations/options-dealing-squatting-response.pdf\" title=\"\">government's consultation</a> didn't want to see any action taken on squatting, but the government ignored the results of its own consultation. What is the point of even having a consultation in the first place? Out of 2,217 responses, 2,126 of those were from members of the public concerned about the impact of criminalising squatting, and only 10 people bothered to write in claiming to be victims of squatting.</p> <p>On top of all this, the new law is completely unaffordable. <a href=\"http://www.squashcampaign.org/\" title=\"\">Squash</a> produced a report while the law was going through the House of Lords \u2013 after it <a href=\"http://www.squashcampaign.org/2011/10/government-bypasses-democracy-to-sneak-through-anti-squatting-laws/\" title=\"\">bypassed the normal process</a> in the Commons \u2013 which shows that this law will cost the taxpayer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/16/squatting-law-reforms-taxpayer\" title=\"\">\u00a3790m over five years</a>. The report concludes that this law alone will wipe out the entire expected costs of the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/legalaidsentencingandpunishmentofoffenders.html\" title=\"\">legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders bill</a>, which is supposed to be a cost-cutting bill.</p> <p>Unlikely bedfellows such as the <a href=\"http://www.pla.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/101553/Squatting_-_summary_of_various_responses.pdf\" title=\"\">Metropolitan police</a>, <a href=\"http://lawsocietymedia.org.uk/Press.aspx?ID=1528\" title=\"\">The Law Society</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pla.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/101553/Squatting_-_summary_of_various_responses.pdf\" title=\"\">The Criminal Bar Association</a> and numerous Homeless Charities such as <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/pressreleases.php/459/years-imprisonment-for-vulnerable-squatters-to-be-forced-through-next-week\" title=\"\">Crisis</a> have come out strongly against it and squatters know they have this on their side. We believe that possibly even the government ministers pushing this through will admit it is not popular legislation.</p> <p>So how has this all happened? The political process that has criminalised squatting in residential properties was undertaken by an elite minority who actively ignored the opinions of the vulnerable and their advocates. Using manipulative rhetoric and purposefully obfuscatory propaganda to delegitimise the experiences and arguments of opponents, they made their decisions <a href=\"http://www.squashcampaign.org/2012/03/you-know-something-stinks-when-its-only-debated-at-midnight/\" title=\"\">in the dark hours of the night</a> and in scripted performances, deploying authoritarian and discretionary power. This is a sham democracy.</p> <p>The attack against squatting has always been a rightwing ploy to defend and enhance private property rights over the human right to shelter. <a href=\"http://evictionresistance.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">New groups</a> have sprung up to support and defend squats from evictions in response to the new law, so it could get nasty in the next few weeks. Who can blame them? They have nowhere else to go.</p>",

  "<p>The older I get the more I realise that whenever society corrects one injustice it risks creating another by what it does. Two classic examples leap out of successive pages of the Guardian on Friday, one <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/31/charities-end-squatters-rights-homelessness\" title=\"\">the new law to criminalise squatting</a>, the next the fallout from the Home Office's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students\" title=\"\">decision to remove London Metropolitan University's licence</a> to recruit and teach students from outside the EU.</p> <p>Were those actions correcting injustices \u2013 or merely the vindictive responses of a Tory-dominated coalition to the kind of people it doesn't like, squatters and foreign students? There may be a touch of the latter in the calculation, hopes of easy applause lines at the coming Conservative conference. But the same could be said in reverse about a Labour government being a soft touch to abuses such as squatting and \u2013 especially \u2013 student visa fraud.</p> <p>We all know cases, admittedly the minority, where squatters have occupied people's homes when they've been on holiday, had the builders in or were renting it out while living somewhere else. The Daily Mail doesn't make up these stories, though it loves to print them. Councils and housing associations have been plagued with squatting problems for decades.</p> <p>It's just a lazy cliche to claim that all squats are in houses that have been empty for years or belong to rich foreigners who deserve to get their place trashed. Needy families have been deprived of a home because squatters have derailed building plans and gobbled building funds in court fees.</p> <p>But, as with the clampdown on London Met's poor visa management, a lot of innocents get hurt in the squeeze. As Owen Bowcott reports from a squat on Friday \u2013 it's here \u2013 the civil law against squatting, often painfully slow and open to manipulation, that is being reinforced from midnight by criminal sanctions in England and Wales: up to six months in jail and a fine of up to \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Right on cue, up pops David Cameron's ambitious housing minister, Grant Shapps, who may be making an elementary mistake by his high-profile tactics ahead of the government reshuffle, to say the law is \"shifting the scales back in favour of the homeowner\", a line from his draft party conference speech, I expect.</p> <p>He's right, but he may also be shifting them there scales back in favour of property spivs, useless councils and housing associations, and others for whom housing is merely a tradeable commodity, not a social necessity, the unemployed or casually employed, the recently divorced or mentally ill for whom a squat may be a temporary lifeline.</p> <p>One such example surfaced on Radio 4's Today, the same \"Katie\" whom Owen Bowcott interviewed. Though a criminal conviction would damage her career (she's a supply teacher doing an Open University course and voluntary work to improve her CV), she's ended up in a squat after leaving an abusive relationship. That experience may have given her the articulate skills to stand up to Today's John Humphrys better than many a minister.</p> <p>No, she insisted, squatting isn't denying an owner the right to use their property in the way that car theft is, because the owner can use the civil courts to get it back when they want it. Her squat is in a house that has been left empty for years, has no water or electricity and leaking roofs. \"The crime is surely leaving houses empty when there is a shortage.\"</p> <p>Even the chap from the property lobby was hard-pressed to get cross with her. As Bowcott's interviewees explain, the law is badly drafted and most squats are in empty buildings, occupied by people who are not making a political point, but just want somewhere to live in an era of rising rents. As licensed squats remind us all, they sometimes serve a useful purpose just by being there.</p> <p>Is evicting squatters live on 24/7 TV, some of whom will have political motives, and using up valuable police time in the process, really what ministers want? Plenty of viewers who know more about rising housing costs than the average minister will sympathise with the squatters \u2013 especially those as articulate and reasonable as Katie. It's divisive, the opposite of the August Olympics, and ministers are currently not very popular.</p> <p>What the housing policy shares with the student visa problem is that both mix a traditional social good \u2013 a decent roof over one's head, the chance of a good education as the path to a better future \u2013 with the commoditisation of both, property as a source of speculation, student visas as a lucrative instrument of illegal immigration for economic, not educational, purposes.</p> <p>The fact that universities face pressure in an era of cuts to raise their sources of income, not least from foreign students who pay more, only serves to underline how the state gets drawn into \u2013 or actively encourages \u2013 such commoditisation.</p> <p>It would be naive to deny that such tensions have always existed in some form or another. Asylum laws are sometimes abused, just as human rights laws designed to protect the innocent are sometimes abused by the very guilty \u2013 often with the help of rights-waving lawyers. End one abuse and the chances are that the new protection will be abused by the unscrupulous. That's life.</p> <p>I have no idea how chaotic London Met's visa procedures were. I know that ministers have closed down private colleges for bogus activity and note that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-recruitment-offices-india\" title=\"\">the man from a private company in Delhi specialising in finding students university places in the UK, whom Helen Pidd interviewed</a> for the Guardian, acknowledged that, while his firm was only interested in genuine scholars: \"We divide the market into two categories \u2013 the university market for genuine students and the immigration market.\"</p> <p>I can't condemn the government for trying to cut down on illegal immigration at a time of rising unemployment and public spending cuts when \u2013 so a small article in the Friday Guardian notes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/30/net-immigration-falls-slightly-216000-ons\" title=\"\">\u2013 net immigration is still running in excess of 216,000 a year</a>. But 2,700 London Met students, most of them legitimate in their search for a degree, are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-met-university-removal-from-uk\" title=\"\">now anxiously scrambling to find other places</a> as a result.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2012. The original implied that Puneet Soin, who manages the Indian office of the commercial firm Study In UK (SIUK), represented London Metropolitan University. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>When setting up a retail business, you may find that there are many issues to consider before picking a location. Are the premises suitable for your small business? Will you be too far off the beaten track? How can you check out the competition?</p> <p>There's no question about the importance of getting it right, though. After all, it's tough enough out there for retailers operating in the UK right now.

  "<p>Japan is a safe haven for global investors. So much so that the yen has soared in value.</p> <p>Government pride that the country is loved by currency traders is offset by the resulting high value of the yen. Exports are already being hit.</p> <p>On a visit to London this week, Japan's top currency official said the time may have come to intervene.</p> <p>Takehiko Nakao, vice finance minister for international affairs, said in a speech in London: \"Exports have been influenced by supply chain changes and problems in Europe, some advanced economies and also in China. And we are also suffering from a very appreciated yen ... If needed we will take very decisive action in the market, that is our stance.\"</p> <p>Nakao is upset that the euro, which once challenged the yen and dollar as a safe haven, is now considered a joke. He wants the European Central Bank to make good on a pledge to buy Spanish and Italian sovereign debt to reassure global markets that it will protect all 17 members of the eurozone</p> <p>Reuters reported that Tokyo spent a record \u00a58tn (\u00a364bn) in unilateral intervention in the currency market last autumn when the dollar hit a record low of \u00a575.31, and another \u00a51tn later in that year on undeclared forays.</p> <p>The yen has risen almost a third since 2007, Nakao said. The dollar has lost around 7.5% against the yen in the last five months alone.</p> <p>Exports of Japanese manufactured goods are already expensive compared with Chinese and Korean equivalents. A high yen compounds the problem. One of Kyocera's solar panels can set back an environmentally conscious consumer twice as much as a Chinese rival. It will have 25 years of quality control tests behind it and a longer guarantee, but the up-front cost can be the difference between a sale and no sale.</p> <p>One response by ministers has been to subsidise local purchases. Solar panels are a case in point. With nuclear out of favour, the government has embarked on a huge solar panel installation programme. It's a fantastic plan from an environmental point of view, and probably helps Kyocera's profits, but needs to be paid for.</p> <p>The Japanese have proved reluctant to agree to rises in taxes since the 1990 property crash and have only just conceded to a rise in VAT from 5% to 8%. A lack of tax revenue to fund investment has forced the government to run up higher debts. Japan's debt to GDP ratio is the highest in the developed world at more than 200%. Luckily for the government it has an implicit, unwritten agreement with Japanese families, which is that all the money they don't pay in taxes must be invested in government bonds. Thereby government spending is not financed by tax revenues but from IOUs to Japanese investors.</p> <p>But this scheme is running out of steam. The ageing population is drawing more from its pensions and savings than it is squirrelling away. Therefore the capacity of Japanese households to buy bonds is diminishing.</p> <p>Nakao says the answer is monetary intervention in the form of currency selling to drive down the price. But yet again we are listening to an official reaching for a monetary policy solution when there are more fundamental reasons for the high value of the yen.</p> <p>They need to think of another way to organise the economy than via an export drive that recycles the profits into state spending via government bond buying.</p>",

Abramovich, who remains on good terms with President Putin, said he did not owe Berezovsky anything.</p> <p>It was the biggest private litigation battle in British legal history.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/berezovsky-abramovich-summary.pdf\" title=\"\">her judgment</a>, Gloster said the case \"fell to be decided almost exclusively on the facts; very few issues of law were involved&#xa0;\u2026 The case was one where, in the ultimate analysis, the court had to decide whether to believe Mr Berezovsky or Mr&#xa0;Abramovich.\"</p> <p>Berezovsky, she concluded, was not credible. \"On my analysis of the entirety of the evidence, I found Mr Berezovsky an unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes.</p> <p>\"At times the evidence which he gave was deliberately dishonest; sometimes he was clearly making his evidence up as he went along in response to the perceived difficulty in answering the questions in a manner consistent with his case.</p> <p>\"At other times, I gained the impression that he was not necessarily being deliberately dishonest, but had deluded himself into believing his own version of events. On occasions he tried to avoid answering questions by making long and irrelevant speeches, or by professing to have forgotten facts which he had been happy to record in his pleadings or witness statements.\"</p> <p>By contrast, Abramovich, Gloster explained, \"gave careful and thoughtful answers, which were focused on the specific issues about which he was being questioned. At all times, he was concerned to ensure that he understood the precise question, and the precise premise underlying the question which he was being asked.</p> <p>\"He was meticulous in making sure that, despite the difficulties of the translation process, he understood the sense of the questions which were being put to him.</p> <p>\"Where he had relevant knowledge, he was able to give full and detailed answers; he took care to distinguish between his own knowledge, reconstructed assumptions and speculation&#xa0;\u2026 In conclusion I found Mr Abramovich to be a truthful, and on the whole reliable, witness.\"</p> <p>The judge found that the agreements between the two oligarchs were not as Berezovsky had portrayed them in his claims. \"It follows that I dismiss Mr Berezovsky's claims both in relation to Sibneft and in relation to RusAl in their entirety,\" she said.</p> <p>Speaking outside the court later, Berezovsky said: \"I'm absolutely amazed at what has happened today. I'm surprised completely \u2013 particularly because Lady Gloster took responsibility for rewriting Russian history.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he regretted bringing the legal action, he said: \"I don't regret anything.\"</p> <p>Berezovsky indicated that he might launch an appeal against the high court's decision but said he would have to speak to his lawyers first.</p> <p>\"When I came to the court I had prepared a phrase,\" he explained. \"Churchill said that democracy is bad but there's nothing better. I was going to say an English court is bad but there's nothing better. Today I have doubts about whether that's accurate. Sometimes I have the impression that Putin himself wrote the judgment.\"</p> <p>A statement issued on behalf of Abramovich said: \"There were many serious allegations made against Mr Abramovich by Mr Berezovsky, including attacks on Mr Abramovich's honesty and integrity.</p> <p>\"We are pleased that the judge has firmly rejected all such allegations and has described Mr Abramovich as a truthful and frank witness who showed a responsible and honest approach when giving evidence in this case.</p> <p>\"We appreciate that, to many people, this case has been a uniquely Russian one, and should therefore have been heard in the Russian court system.</p> <p>\"Nevertheless, Mr Abramovich has always had great faith in the fairness of the English legal system and is both pleased and grateful for today's outcome.</p> <p>\"He stated from the outset that there was no merit to the allegations made by Mr Berezovsky, and this position has now been comprehensively vindicated by the court.\"</p>",
  "<p>In front of the blackboard in a classroom in Nabari village, northern Ghana, tightly packed rows of dishevelled wooden benches give a sense of the number of primary school children crammed into this room, obediently copying the dictation by rote. They are surrounded by filthy walls and a weather-beaten corrugated ceiling.</p> <p>\"There are many pupils but only three classrooms, so they have to pair classes,\" says Memuna Sandow, district assembly woman for the towns of Wulugu, Silinga and Nabari in the West Mamprusi region of northern Ghana. \"The quality of teaching is very poor \u2013 teachers who are sent here from other places do not want to stay.\"</p> <p>\"There is very low school enrollment,\" Sandow adds. \"As well as all these problems, not all the parents can afford uniform. The children have to walk 6km to fetch water in the evenings; sometimes they are so tired they don't go to school the next day.\"</p> <p>The barriers to education highlight the complex development challenges in this rural part of Ghana's northern savannah. The area's extreme poverty led to it being handpicked as the site of the new Millennium Village Project (MVP), the integrated approach to rural development spearheaded by Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University's Earth Institute.</p> <p>The production of oil in southern Ghana has helped make its economy one of the fastest growing in the world, accelerating poverty reduction there. But the number of people living in poverty in the north has increased \u2013 by an estimated 1 million over the past 20 years. The majority of Ghana's 6 million people living below the poverty line are now in the north.</p> <p>The MVP, launched this week by Ghana's new president John Dramani Mahama and UK international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, aims to address this gap by creating a millennium villages \"cluster\" in an area that cuts across two of the north's poorest regions, West Mamprusi and Builsa. The scheme will target 34 communities with a total population of approximately 27,000 people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395904878\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/30/1346326990440/MDG--Maize-farmers-in-Nab-001.jpg\" alt=\"MDG : Maize farmers in Nabari\" width=\"140\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maize farmers in Nabari.

It is the poorest part of the country, the furthest away from infrastructure, the furthest away from the growth areas of the economy.\"</p> <p>\"This region has a number of issues,\" said David Sunbo, MVP team leader. \"There is a more than 30km journey to access healthcare, education levels are very low, and people run out of food for almost half of the year. You can drive 60km through the whole cluster without seeing any vehicles because the state of the roads is so bad.\"</p> <p>The new MVP has $18.1m (\u00a311.5m) funding from the UK's Department for International Development (DfID). The money will be provided over five years, the first time the department has offered financial support for the project, and equates to roughly $90 a person being spent annually on the ground. The remaining spending \u2013 an estimated $60 a person annually \u2013 is from other sources, including the government of Ghana, NGOs and the international community.</p> <p>\"We are trying to make clear, more than anyone has tried to be in the past, what the cost of providing primary services to lift people out of poverty really is,\" said Sachs. \"At the moment we think it is $150 per person per year, which is really a very small amount.\"</p> <p>Sachs has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/oct/19/millennium-villages-project-proper-evaluation\" title=\"\">come under fire recently</a> after critics found serious flaws in the MVP's evaluation methods and argued results were overstated or impossible to verify. In May, medical journal the Lancet was <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960824-1/fulltext\" title=\"\">forced to withdraw sections of its assessment of child survival rates</a> following criticism it overstated outcomes for child mortality. Paul Pronyk, director of monitoring and evaluation at Columbia University's Centre for Global Health and Economic Development, left the project.</p> <p>The new MVP will, for the first time, be independently evaluated. \"We are proceeding cautiously \u2013 the proof is in the pudding,\" says Mitchell. Evaluation of the project, which has conducted baseline surveys of the 34 communities within the site, and 68 control communities selected for their similarity to the project sites, has been commissioned from <a href=\"http://www.itad.com/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Itad</a>, a UK-based development consultancy.</p> <p>Part of the emphasis on evaluation is to help project organisers achieve a proven model for development that can be scaled up to encompass whole regions and even countries. But in Nabari there was scepticism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395904879\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/30/1346327060014/MDG--Jeremiah-Imoro-and-h-001.jpg\" alt=\"MDG : Jeremiah Imoro and his neighbours\" width=\"140\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremiah Imoro and his neighbours. Photograph: Afua Hirsch</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Afua Hirsch/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"I don't believe this will work,\" says Jeremiah Imoro, 32, a subsistence farmer who harvests four acres of maize every year. \"My farm is not large enough. Since my father died, I support my mother and my seven siblings, and my own wife and three children. The food I grow is not enough and there is none left to sell for cash that we need to buy things. We have to go to the forest to chop wood and sell charcoal instead.</p> <p>\"What I need is more income. If I could buy more fertiliser, pay for a tractor for ploughing, and grow more expensive crops like beans, then things would be better for me and my family.\"</p> <p>But organisers say Imoro is exactly the kind of farmer who will benefit from the project. \"We are taking a business approach to agriculture so that we are not continuously dependent on external support,\" said Sunbo. \"We are giving farmers loans to pay for ploughing, fertiliser and seeds \u2013 they will pay it back and then the amount can be given back to them the next year. We also have in place a plan to expand the facilities for irrigation.\"</p> <p>Mastering the business development needs of farmers is something Sachs admits the MVPs have struggled with, and although other projects will last 10 years, the new MVP will last only five. \"We have to speed up our work on business development,\" says Sachs. \"In other sites, it took three years to work on food production and agriculture. Here we want to move faster, bringing in important help to agriculture sooner.\"</p> <p>Many of the challenges in West Mamprusi relate to infrastructure, and the need for comprehensive irrigation, roads and electricity, things the organisers say they must rely on the government to provide.</p> <p>The project site is not connected to the national grid and, except for a tiny scattering of solar panels, has no electricity. Population growth and a lack of family planning are major issues in West Mamprusi, straining already limited food supplies and making education unaffordable.</p> <p>The MVP has modest aims to increase contraception use among married women, from 8% to 35%. Other targets are to increase the number of children sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets to 80%, halve the under-five mortality rate, and ensure 90% of children finish primary school, in line with the millennium development goals.</p> <p>Sachs is hopeful the project will show these goals can be accomplished through relatively small per capita spending. \"These are very hard, very poor places,\" he says. \"The budget is not very large, and we are trying to make a small amount of money go a long way.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 31 August 2012.

This is where IT companies are spending their money innovating, so by picking cloud you will get access to new features faster and you won't have to wait for a new version, as they will be available immediately.</p> <p><strong>Don't always feel you have to update software:</strong> If it's desktop-based software, I would say only update (and pay for updates) when you feel the new version is bringing something you really need. More than 60% of all features in most software is never used.</p> <p>As for free updates (patches), most software offers some way to accept automatic patching of the software and that way you can save a lot of time.</p> <p><em>Nick Goode runs </em><a href=\"http://uk.sageone.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Sage One</em></a><em> for Sage UK</em></p> <p><strong>Get help if you need it:</strong> Startups and small businesses are all about focus, differentiation and their customer.

For example, a web portal to allow you, your clients and your suppliers to all work together on a project may differentiate your business from your competitors.</p> <p>So if there is limited budget and the trains aren't running on time, you need to fix that.

Also, as a small company you're very vulnerable to image damage. You can only afford to lose a small number of customers.</p> <p>Security doesn't need to be hugely expensive or complicated. Here are a few simple steps: list your assets (your data), and list the threats against them. It doesn't have to be specific, for example, losing data in transit, data corruption and so on. Then work out the impact on your organisation, and list how you will treat or protect against these risks.</p> <p>For example, you run the very real risk of losing your laptop (get off the train without it, leave it in the coffee shop, having it stolen). If it's got all your customer data on it, make sure you have secure backups elsewhere and encrypt the laptop, so if it's stolen all you have lost is a laptop and not all of your customers.</p> <p><strong>Consider alternative hardware options:</strong> If you're talking about cloud-based solutions, it opens up another point: BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). Most people have personal smartphones, laptops and tablets. What if you could use them for work? It means the company doesn't have to invest in more hardware and support, the user gets to use the kit they want and it's flexible for remote working.</p> <p>Clearly there is a risk when storing company data on your personal device. Cloud-based solutions, where all of the data is stored in the cloud, make the device you are using less relevant. If you wanted to put company data on the personal device there is sandboxing technology such as DME (Dynamic Mobile Exchange).

With a mobile site, you're still waiting for a customer to choose to visit your site, but with an app and using push notification, you can generate customer interest and footfall when you need it, so it comes down to how you are using the app facilities.</p> <p>For example, if you are a baker and stock goes out of date at the end of the day, can you send an exclusive voucher to your customers in the area at 4pm telling them that for the next hour the stock is half price? A good app platform can give you that ability to react to what is happening in your business right now, and generate interest when you need it.</p> <p><em>John Antunes is the director of SME and channels for </em><a href=\"http://www.sap.com/uk/index.epx\" title=\"\"><em>SAP</em></a></p> <p><strong>Scalability is crucial:</strong> The number one piece of tech advice for someone starting a business from scratch is to invest in software or products that can grow with the business. Scalability is crucial to avoid spending money on technology that you are likely to have to replace in a year or two.</p> <p><strong>BYOD is a great option for small businesses: </strong>The cost savings for the business (the hardware costs shift to the user so the business saves money), and the increased employee satisfaction with using a device that's convenient and familiar are key to the growing need for BYOD strategies within businesses of all size.</p> <p>More SMEs are embracing flexible working and working from home. According to a recent report by Forrester, 71% of SMEs are mobile. Of course, as a result of this increase in BYOD and mobile working, businesses need to consider how applications and software can be used on employees' own devices and, as the business grows, how can plans and guidelines be implemented when it comes to BYOD in the workplace.</p> <p><em>Francesca James is the editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.techbubbles.co.uk/?www.techbubbles.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Techbubbles</em></a></p> <p><strong>Investing in a server is a great idea for larger businesses:</strong> A server can create a hub around which your business can operate and significantly improve productivity.

  "<p>After more than a century lighting up the world, the switch will be flicked off across the EU for the final time on incandescent bulbs on Saturday as the phased ban on their sale is completed.</p> <p>From 1 September, an EU directive aimed at reducing the energy use of lighting means that retailers will no longer be allowed to sell 40W and 25W incandescent bulbs. Similar bans came into effect for 60W and 100W incandescent bulbs over the past three years. The restrictions are predicted to save 39 terawatt-hours of electricity across the EU annually by 2020.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the UK government <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120522/halltext/120522h0002.htm\" title=\"\">said</a> the ban would bring an \"average annual net benefit\" of \u00a3108m to the UK between 2010 and 2020 in energy savings. But the phase-out of incandescents has been met with resistance by some users who say replacement technologies, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp\" title=\"\">CFLs</a>, halogens and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_lamp\" title=\"\">LEDs</a>, do not perform as well. Despite the substantial long-term financial savings promised, the higher upfront price of replacement bulbs has also been criticised by those opposing the ban.</p> <p>\"The phase-out has been very smooth,\" said Peter Hunt, joint chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.thelia.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Lighting Industry Association</a>. \"Concerns about poor performance of replacement bulbs have been proved wrong. The new LED replacements for halogen downlighters that have come on to the market over the past year work just as well, for example. Price is still a barrier, but that's coming down almost daily as volume increases.\"</p> <p>Hunt said \"scaremongering\" about people stockpiling incandescents to beat the ban had proved to be unfounded: \"There is no evidence to support this. Even so-called loopholes \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/9498092/Retailers-avoid-ban-on-traditional-light-bulbs.html\" title=\"\">'rough-service'</a> incandescent bulbs that a few retailers are reported to still be selling \u2013 are overplayed. The law is clear: they should not be sold for household use. It says so on the packaging. Any retailer is risking a visit from government inspectors if they continue to sell them.\"</p> <p>Before the phase-out began in 2009, an estimated 200m incandescent bulbs were sold each year in the UK. But the ban has not achieved as much of a reduction in energy use as was first hoped, said Hunt. \"There is a trend now to use more and more lighting in our homes. The popularity of halogen downlighters in homes has halted the decline in energy use. This will continue until LED downlighters become the norm.\"</p> <p>Green groups have welcomed the final stage of the phase out. Dustin Benton of the Green Alliance said: \"Whatever your view of the EU, this legislation is good news for consumers. It rewards innovative manufacturers and could cut bills by \u00a3158 per year. The government should ignore Eurosceptic opposition and help consumers to save money by regulating for efficient products.\"</p> <p>Matt Prescott, who founded the <a href=\"http://ban-the-bulb.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ban the Bulb campaign</a> seven years ago, said: \"I think the talk of widespread panic is massively overdone, and that the vast majority of the public have adjusted to using the next generation of lighting technologies with the absolute minimum of fuss and drama. Lightbulbs offer a useful and timely case study for how greater energy efficiency could be achieved in a wide variety of household appliances and even cars and houses. Laws mandating higher levels of performance work and work quickly.\"</p> <p>James Russill, technical development manager at the <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Energy Saving Trust</a> , said the ban is making a \"real difference\" to the national energy consumption: \"Fitting just one energy-saving light bulb can save you on average \u00a33 a year \u2013 and by swapping all the incandescent bulbs in your home for energy-saving alternatives you could save around \u00a330 a year from your energy bills, and 110kg of carbon dioxide.\"</p> <p>Katy Bryan, sustainability manager at Philips UK, one of the largest bulb manufacturers, said lighting consumes 19% of electricity globally: \"This poses a major challenge, in a world facing resource scarcity and climate change. Energy-efficient lighting can help and legislation that raises the profile of energy-efficient technologies, such as LED, is naturally welcomed. However, more can be done to educate consumers on the choices available to them and to ensure they understand that there is no need to compromise as energy efficiency does not have to mean poor design or performance.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's show-and-tell time with the Finnish division of Gaga's \"Little Monsters\". Anyone who throws a particularly original gift on stage \u2013 last night at the same venue there was a giant used tampon \u2013 gets to meet her after the gig. She bends down to receive a Barbie doll, bites its head off and tears a pink plastic thigh from a hip socket: \"Come on, you little slut!\" Twenty fans are selected each evening from within Gaga's latest innovation, a walled enclosure at the front of the stage known as the \"monster pit\". It's reserved for the kids who spent the night outside in sleeping bags; the ones who fail to get in hover beyond the fortifications like lepers outside a medieval castle. There's one of those too \u2013 50ft high with flashing neon lights, a sort of Disney-meets-Rick&nbsp;Wakeman affair. It takes seven hours to construct every day.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ladygaga.com/bornthiswayball/\" title=\"\">Born This Way Ball</a>, which started its European leg in mid-August after trawling Asia and Australia, is a kind of allegorical, mock-medieval mystery play that turns into a story about an alien (Gaga) persecuted by a giant hologram (also Gaga) whose name is Mother G.O.A.T. The plot is playfully designed to fold in on itself if you analyse it: straight after Bad Romance Gaga declares that when she's extracted enough art, music and love from us all, she'll come back and invade planet Earth \"as\u2026 your pop singer!\"</p> <p>The most amazing thing this woman could do right now would be to play her piano in jeans and a T-shirt. Until she does, her baroque fantasies continue to roll out with wit and an incredible lightness of touch. Costume changes (there are 18, from a repeat of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/13/lady-gaga-meat-dress-vmas\" title=\"\">\"meat dress\"</a> to the alien carapace she wears for Government Hooker) are much quicker than on the Monster Ball tour. A giant vagina appears for Born This Way and is quickly dragged, deflating, back into the castle. Even the show's sexy heavy-metal aesthetic is mainly a chance for her to turn herself into a motorbike, arms for forks, and glide around the stage face-first with a female dancer on her back.</p> <p>You really appreciate how stupid this ongoing \"Gaga versus Madonna debate\" is too. She performs Americano, a steaming, Latino melody, wearing a machine-gun bra and being caressed by half a dozen near-naked dancers. Gaga is not \"copying\" Madonna \u2013 she has virtually <em>eaten</em> the woman and is throwing up a wonderful, projectile, multicoloured arc of the stuff night after night, for all to see.</p> <p>Much of the two-hour show whirls by with the same pure physical energy <em>Oklahoma!</em> or <em>South Pacific </em>must have had 60 years ago. There are very few close-ups of her face for the first half \u2013 which will annoy millions of people \u2013 but you see something bigger in the sharp elbows and thrusting determination of the tiny figure on stage. Dissolving herself into the chorus of dancers for Telephone and Bad Kids, Gaga is upholding her promise of hard work in exchange for adoration. She's always talked like some weird public servant \u2013 \"I promise to sing and dance my ass off for you all night long\" \u2013 and at times is frankly exhausted tonight, breathing raggedly into her mic.</p> <p>Not that you worry for her, really. Can popstars even <em>have</em> breakdowns in a post-Gaga age? Britney was shocking to watch because her face said everything was fine when you knew that it wasn't; Amy was shocking because her face showed that everything was wrong. But Gaga is a robust, cartoon embodiment of all human emotion, good and bad. She's at her warmest tonight singing a new song about suicide; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHy-BiSSgC0\" title=\"\">Princess Die</a> runs through various fantasies \u2013 \"I'll do it in the swimming pool so everybody sees\" \u2013 before concluding that no death's as stylish as that of \"another dead blonde\" whose rich boyfriend proposed \"with the paparazzi all swarming around\". You wonder how it'll go down at Twickenham on Saturday. And whether a depressed teen at her feet would fully grasp the song's intended irony.</p> <p>A Little Monster drifts across the car park \u2013 she's about 18 and she's lost her friends and her ride home. Did she enjoy the show? \"The meat dress was difficult for me,\" she says thoughtfully, \"because I could actually smell it. Look, the point with Lady Gaga is she can be everything you love most in the world, and the next minute she can be everything you hate. At that moment I hated her.\" She sounds almost irritated. Then again, she's been awake since 6&nbsp;o'clock on Monday morning, and it's now 2am on Wednesday.</p>",
  "<h2>Third runway at Heathrow</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/28/heathrow-third-runway-not-solution\">The transport secretary, Justine Greening, has ruled out a third runway at Heathrow</a>, saying it is \"not a long-term solution\" to improving the UK's aviation capacity.<br> <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17940261\">newenergyspace</a></strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will be built, one way or another. The only other option is to close Heathrow and Gatwick and build a brand new airport in the Estuary, which would be a typical London-centric approach as it would block the rest of the country off and turn the M25 into anarchy.<br>Another solution is this: Build a new, large airport in the north or midlands, and get people from those areas to use those. If Heathrow is supposed to be just a 'hub' where people can change, use it for that and remove all none-connecting flights to free up slots.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17940602\">falco1978</a></strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Expansion of Heathrow would be very damaging to a large part of London's quality of life. The requirement of planes to Heathrow to land into a pre-dominant westerley wind and Heathrows location to the west of London means that a high number of planes have to low-fly over London to land. This isn't just about South West London but both North East and South East. I can imagine non-Londoners don't care but it's idiotic to have this noise-disruption over the most densely populated area of the country.<br>Whilst it may be the most expensive option the long-term best solution is for the Thames Estuary location where most noise occurs over the sea. Having this linked to London via high speed trains and Europe with the chunnel would make it accessible and as green as would be possible.<br>Why everyone has suddenly decided we're being constrained by airport capacity is beyond me... who exactly is it effecting? if it means there is a constraint on needless ecologically-damaging flying then so be it!</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17941069\">poddys</a></strong> comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Geographically speaking, a new airport east or northeast of London would just make it harder still for people west of London to get there. Living in Southampton I already discount Stanstead when looking for flights because of the long journey times to get there.<br>Logically, I would have thought that a new large airport somewhere around Newbury would (a) take the traffic pressure off London and (b) make the airport far more accessible for people from the South, Southwest, The Midlands and South Wales. You have the M4 running east/west from there and the A34 running north/south.<br>Building a humongous airport from scratch there, with a view to it replacing Heathrow in the future makes sense to me. Of course nobody is going to want one of the largest airports in the world on their doorstep, but starting from scratch this ought to give airport designers an opportunity to allow for the best design for terminals, parking, and access to and from the airport.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17941097\">richardofbirmingham</a></strong> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A wider strategic approach than a londoncentric one is needed. Trade with the developing world requires a reinvigoration of the manufacturing heartlands of the north and midlands. London will continue to be the prime tourist destination of choice and financial services is likely to remain a major earner but a rebalancing is crucial if we are to continue to prosper. This implies a shift in infrastructure investment away from the south east and London, in particular. Expansion of Birmingham International Airport combined with the direct rail link into the high speed continental system which will connect the midlands and, later, the north, is a better choice. A rail stop off facility in London will meet any capacity issue especially, as many will no longer need to travel to Heathrow from other areas.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Ghana's returnees</h2> <p>Fellow returnees provided fascinating insights in response to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/26/ghana-returnees-afua-hirsch-africa\">Afua Hirsch's piece on her own experience and the trend among Ghanaians to return to Ghana to work and live</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17910850\">huggahoddie</a></strong> posts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Afua you have written my own story. I didn't return to Ghana until my 32nd birthday last year and it humbled me to think that I was ever ashamed of my heritage. I learned about Nkrumah, Du Bois and many other pan africanists who fought to valiantly for my freedom. To think that I ever wanted to be disassociated with them because I bought into the lies the media here told me makes me sick.<br>I can't wait to go back and do what I can to build the country and get back to my roots.<br>Thank you so much for this article and thank you Guardian for letting alternative voices be heard</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17913088\">nansikom</a></strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thanks, Afua, for this excellent and informative article. As a white Brit married to a Ugandan lady with South Africa as home, my family and I have navigated similar issues to you but in a country that is still recovering from the institutionalised racism and oppression of apartheid. I recognise, however, your nuanced portrait of the complexities of African countries. I usually work in three or four other southern African countries for short periods of up to three weeks at a time every year and, while there are obviously similarities, there are also great differences. Zimbabwe is as different from South Africa as the UK is from France!<br>I think that the most important issue for Africa is however one that you didn't mention and that is the rural development. Africa is the continent that has the most under-utilised land and natural resources and the rest of the world is already getting hold of these reseources very rapidly! The greatest differences throughout Africa are between vibrant and rapidly growing cities and rural areas, still often deeply isolated, where subsistence agriculture often dominates and where poverty is at its worst.<br>Transition from communal to freehold land tenure systems is not the panacea for development that many, including the World Bank, seem to think it is. It is however vital that mixed land tenure systems are developed that both encourage inward investment for commercial agriculture while safeguarding land rights and access for the poor. The great issue of the next half century as African rural areas open up to the outside world, will be to ensure that rural development is equitable and benefits the poor.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17911503\">Shamboz</a></strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good article but my experience is slightly different. The degree to which you can truley appreciate Ghana depends like any where else on your family background and their access to money. Most Ghanaians live from hand to mouth and superstition is the mainstay of society. Attitudes to difference eg homosexuality are still archaic and many of the wealthy blame the 'lazy' poor for their own misfortune.<br>I vist regularly and have been disappointed at some of these issues. One of the problems that was being broadcast by the media was the disgraceful treatment of albinos similar to other parts of Africa.<br>Ghanaians are suspicious of people like me as they see us as a threat to the status quo. Expressing views contrary to the norm has left me feeling quite isolated.<br>It is a great country but many attitudes can be unkind and difficult to stomach.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17915493\">abowbe</a></strong> comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am also mixed British Ghanaian. I took little interest in my Ghanaian culture or heritage until my late teens. I was the black girl with a funny name in a predominantly white area (compared to being the obruni with the Ghanaian name in Ghana).I took my first trip to Ghana 3 years ago. Despite feeling permanently frustrated and overheated, and finding it difficult to comprehend some of the conservative and narrow-minded attitudes, I immediately knew it was going to be a major part of my life. Although I am not sure that I will be relocating, i'll continue to make frequent trips for personal and professional purposes.<br>My partner's story is different. Having moved to the UK as a child, he made ad hoc trips to Ghana growing up. When the recession hit and he lost his job here, he began forging links and establishing business in Ghana. He now 'commutes'.<br>I think it's great that we as second (and first) generation Ghanaians have found value and potential in our ancestral land, but we can't loose sight of the realities of life for the majority of Ghanaian people- including our family and friends. Hopefully the influx of returnees will result in greater quality of life and opportunities for local Ghanaians.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17921909\">Kwaku</a></strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Afua, Congratulations on the bold move. It's always good you have a good-paying job to live decently in Ghana. I hate to say that after trying for decades to return and even investing hundreds of thousands of our live savings in Ghana, some of us have given up. Dealing with our entrenched greedy government officials who all emerged after the PNDC era, offends our ethical principles. I am sure you know Ghana has an existing law against allowing dual citizens to participate in elected political office.<br>Ghana and African will never reach full potential as predicted compared to our Asian colleagues who studied and lived in the West due to the specific greed, envy, and direct sabotage of the few greedy men who took over Ghana in Dec.31, 1981 in a coup, which was treason.<br>Afua, as a Diaspora returning with no interest in politics, you are Okay with them. You are no threat! Yours is one of the most honest articles I have read on Ghana and Africa. Most articles fail to mention the high unemployment rates. Great job! Wishing you all the best.

However, I wish you had devoted a little more space discussing the bribery and corruption in Ghana. I think that is what undermines our efforts at development. a development that will ensure social, societal, and economic justice. Corruption starts with the lowly placed public servant; the beat cop on our streets and highways and the clerk tasked with processing your documents to register a company to the top gun at the ministry who determines whether you are awarded a contract to do business with the government. I find it suffocating. Is corruption really endemic to our culture or we just lack the moral fortitude to deal with the syndrome? I was away for over 30 years and to me the major changes appear to be the increased level of corruption and the filth in Accra.</p> </blockquote> <h2>London Met University and international students</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students\">London Met University has lost its right to recruit and teach non-EU students</a> after the government said the institution had failed in its monitoring of its international student body.

We individually lived in fear of being the one who messed up and lost us our CoS/CAS issuing licence. The Academics weren't so keen (they never enjoy admin) but when you reminded them that they could do bugger all research (and lose their grants) if half their post-docs and doctoral students disappeared overnight they suddently paid attention. It's boring and it takes time but that's just tough.<br>There may be excuses for a small number of non-compliances, and the system allows for that. However, there can be no such excuses for the systematic failure to perform the most basic checks, as there seem to have been here. How can they not even be confirming English language capability?

  "<p>The thing that still blows my mind about the internet is that through all the dramatic changes over the last two or three decades, it remains a mostly open public commons that everyone can use. There are many land ownership battles happening all around it, but it has so far withstood challenges to its shape, size, governance and its role in all aspects of our lives.</p> <p>Will that always be the case? Or are too many special interests with unbalanced power breaking down the core principles that made it our space \u2013 a shared space owned by nobody and available to everybody?</p> <p>It used to be that corporate interests were aligned with public interests on the internet. Many early pioneers thrived because they recognised how to create and earn value across the network, via the connection between things, the edges (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory\" title=\"\">read more on Graph Theory</a>). They succeeded by developing services that offered unfettered and easy access to something useful, often embracing some sort of sharing model for partners powered by revenue models built on network effects.</p> <p>These innovators were dependent on open and public participation and a highly distributed network adhering to common standards such as HTTP and HTML. The public and private interests were aligned.</p> <p>However, hypertext was designed for connecting text, not for connecting people. The standards designed for communication, such as SMTP and later XMPP were fine, but no standard for connecting people to other people achieved global adoption.</p> <p>Even backing from the web's founder for a standard called FOAF (<a href=\"http://www.foaf-project.org/\" title=\"\">The Friend of a Friend project</a>) and a Social Network Users' Bill of Rights backed by <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/michael-arringtons-revenge-11032011.html\" title=\"\">Michael Arrington</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble\" title=\"\">Robert Scoble</a> failed to lift the movement for standards in social connections.</p> <p>Without a standard the entrepreneurs got busy coming up with solutions and, eventually, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/aug/28/young-entrepreneurs-build-better-future\" title=\"\">Facebook and Twitter were born</a>. Like their predecessors, they recognised how to create and earn value in the connections between things \u2013 in this case, a network of people, a privately owned social graph.</p> <p>But the social graph they created is not an open, owner-less, public commons. Facebook is interested in Facebook's existence and has no interest in FOAF or XMPP. Industry standards are to be ignored at Facebook (and Apple, Microsoft and sometimes Google) unless they help to acquire customers or to generate PR.</p> <p>Governance is held privately in these spaces. They consult with their customers, but they write their own privacy policies and are held accountable to nobody but public opinion and antiquated legal frameworks around the world.</p> <p>Now, it's a very appealing idea to think about an open and public alternative to the dominant social networks. Many have tried, including <a href=\"http://status.net/\" title=\"\">StatusNet</a> and <a href=\"https://joindiaspora.com/\" title=\"\">Diaspora</a>. And more challengers are on the way.</p> <p>But there are harder problems to solve here that I think matter more than that temporary band-aid. We need to know why the industry failed to adopt a global standard for social networking. Will we go through this again as a market forms inevitably around a digital network of real-world things? Will it repeat again when we learn how to connect raw data?</p> <p>Can the benefits (and therefore the incentives) of ensuring contributions are owned and controlled by a platform's contributors in perpetuity be more commercially viable and legally sensible? Are there ways to support those benefits globally?</p> <p>In what ways can those who are adversely affected by centralised control of social activity hold those forces to account? Where is the balance of power coming from, and how can it be amplified to be an equal force?</p> <p>Much like the founders of the US Constitution, there were some very clever folks who codified open access to this public space we call the internet in ways that effectively future-proofed it. They structured it to reward individual contributions that also benefit the wider community. Instead of pen and paper, the internet's founders used technology standards to accomplish this goal.</p> <p>While it seems very doable to build a successful and lasting digital business that embraces these ideals, the temptation of money and power, the unrelenting competitive pressures and weak incentives to collaborate will steer many good intentions in bad directions over time.</p> <p>I don't think Facebook was ever motivated to support an open public commons, so it's no surprise when they threaten such a thing. But Twitter somehow seemed different. At the moment, it seems from outside Twitter HQ that the company is being crushed by the weight of these pressures, and so is making some bad choices over small issues that will have a big impact over time.</p> <p>It's not what Facebook and Twitter do that really matters, though. The greater concern, in my opinion, is that the types of people who originally created this global network for the rest of us to enjoy aren't being heard or, worse, not getting involved at all anymore.</p> <p>I'm not suggesting we need more powerful bureaucratic standards bodies to slow things down. Arguably, these increasingly powerful platforms are already crushing competition and squeezing out great innovations. We don't need more of that. Stifling innovation always has disastrous effects.</p> <p>What I'm suggesting is that more people will benefit in more ways over a longer period of time if someone can solve this broader organisational problem \u2013 the need to codify open access, shared governance, and other future-proofing tactics for public spaces in whatever shape they take.</p> <p>Social networking is threatening the open public network today. Something else will threaten it tomorrow. We need to work out what can be done today to fuel and secure an ongoing and healthy co-dependency between our public spaces and commercial interests.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>All manner of artists have done well out of Web 2.0. There are countless examples, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/aug/11/bo-burnham-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">comedian Bo Burnham</a> to <a href=\"http://www.pomplamoose.com/\" title=\"\">indie duo Pomplamoose</a>, of undiscovered creatives coming into prominence through canny use of online platforms. Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/justin-bieber\" title=\"\">some singing Canadian kid called Justin</a>.</p> <p>Broadly speaking though, theatre makers haven't benefited in the same way. Social networks and self-publishing might have expanded the promotional possibilities for live work, but, unlike sketches and songs, that work itself doesn't translate neatly into digital forms. Where it has, in the cases of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/apr/10/david-sabel-digital-national-theatre\" title=\"\">NT Live's screenings</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/02/bradley-manning-play-live-streamed\" title=\"\">livestreamed performances</a> by National Theatre Wales, the process has required significant resources and expertise, neither of which can be readily mustered by emerging independents.</p> <p>It's an issue of which David Jubb, co-artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre (<a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk/\" title=\"\">BAC</a>), is acutely aware: \"Obviously there are great things like NT Live, but for my money, theatre is not exploring the full creative potential of what digital engagement might be.\" However, in a characteristically forward-thinking move, BAC is hoping to change that.</p> <p>Today sees the launch of a radical new digital initiative called <a href=\"http://scratchr.net/\" title=\"\">Scratchr</a>. It is very much an extension of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2009/sep/15/work-in-progress-theatre-scratch\" title=\"\">BAC's scratch methodology</a>, whereby artists expose work-in-progress to audiences at various points in the development process and build on the feedback.</p> <p>Scratch began in 2000, dreamt up by Jubb and then artistic director Tom Morris, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2009/feb/24/tom-morris-bristol-old-vic-regional-theatre\" title=\"\">now of Bristol Old Vic</a>. An audience of 40, mostly friends of the artists involved, watched the first scratch night. Now, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/feb/24/theatre1\" title=\"\">though not without its critics</a>, scratch is used all over the world, from the Sydney Opera House to the RSC. At the BAC itself, there's now a regular and willing audience, eager for some creative involvement by proxy, and the formal development ladder has given way to a looser, more accommodating system. \"We've consciously made it a lot more flexible because a lot of work goes one step back, two steps forward,\" says Jubb.</p> <p>Together with his co-director David Micklem, Jubb started considering the possibility of a digital equivalent 18 months ago. They never intended to replicate the existing model online, but hoped to extend its possibilities, knowing, as Jubb puts it, \"that it would change, that it couldn't remain the same.\"</p> <p>\"One of the earliest realisations was that live streaming might be one of the least important aspects,\" says Jubb, who felt the shoestring that scratch inevitably necessitates would make a \"crap\" viewing experience of little benefit to either party.</p> <p>That decision saw Scratchr shift into the realm of social network. BAC dropped its initial developers, a live-streaming company, to pair instead with Carl Morris and Tom Beardshaw of <a href=\"http://nativehq.com/\" title=\"\">NativeHQ</a>, the company behind digital elements of National Theatre Wales' productions, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/apr/24/the-passion-port-talbot-review\" title=\"\">The Passion of Port Talbot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/apr/19/radicalisation-of-bradley-manning-review\" title=\"\">The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning</a>.</p> <p>The site aims to use existing online tools (YouTube, Twitter, comment boxes) \"to enable people with creative ideas to come together to share and develop them.\" To do so, says Beardshaw, who has a background in anthropology, requires some sort of incentive: \"Reciprocity is often at the heart of social interaction, so there has to be some kind of motivation or incentive for anybody to get involved and put effort into thinking about somebody else's ideas.\"</p> <p>As such, NativeHQ proposed a new element to scratch called an 'Itch', which, says Jubb, \"is pre-scratch, just an idea, maybe for a show or a radio play or a story that you can share at that inceptive stage and see if anyone wants to scratch it with you.\"</p> <p>Eventually, anyone will be able start an itch, posting it onto the site to see what feedback comes, thus fostering a community of sorts. The aim is to attract other artists interested in collaborating or producers capable of turning the itch into an actual scratch. Scratches are then documented online through a series of digital assets \u2013 videos, <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/\" title=\"\">audioboos</a>, images etc \u2013 with audience members (and other artists and producers) able to provide feedback and further ideas en route.</p> <p>On one level, Jubb believes this allows BAC to \"uncover idea and talent that it might otherwise take us years to find.\" More importantly, though, it makes scratch more than a snapshot seen mid-process, encompassing the whole process, from start to finish. \"One of the exciting things about it is that it demystifies the theatre-making process,\" Jubb added. \"Audience members can track a piece of work or an artist, enter into dialogue with those artists and come to understand how things get put together.\"</p> <p>Of course, there are concerns, not least the potential for trolling \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/04/works-in-progress-pulse-sampled\" title=\"\">presenting unfinished work is a delicate activity</a>. Done live, an unspoken social contract exists between audience and artist. Online, that could easily get lost or willfully obliterated, leaving artists vulnerable. Jubb recognises the need \"to develop a culture of behaviour\" in order to carry those \"conventions into an online space.\" Accordingly, rather than launching as a finished product with a bang, Scratchr will start softly and evolve \u2013 \"a scratch of a scratch,\" Jubb calls it. Beardshaw says there's no other way: \"When you're developing social software, you need a community to be playing with it, trying to break it.\"</p> <p>For Jubb, however, that's part of the excitement: \"Anything decent on the internet gets adopted and adapted and appropriated for different purposes. It's almost bound to happen with this.\"</p> <p>Not only will this improve the site, it also restores the flexibility of scratch that might otherwise be curtailed by the reliance on a fixed set of digital assets that won't suit every process or artist. \"This isn't going to be for everyone,\" Jubb admits. \"We're not going to force every artist at BAC to use Scratchr and loads of artists won't want to go anywhere near it. That's totally fine. It's just another tool. If it became an alternative [to live scratches in the building], it would be a disaster.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, Jubb hopes that the digital version might have an impact comparable to the initial scratch process. Not that he's counting his chickens: \"It might go absolutely nowhere or it might become a global creative tool for sharing ideas. The reality will probably be somewhere in between.\"</p> <p><em>Matt Trueman is a theatre critic and journalist \u2013 read his </em><a href=\"http://carouseloffantasies.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Carousel of Fantasies blog</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/matttrueman\" title=\"\"><em>@mattrueman</em></a></p> <p><em>Find out more at </em><a href=\"http://scratchr.net/\" title=\"\"><em>Scratchr</em></a><em> or via </em><a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Battersea Arts Centre</em></a><em> \u2013 follow BAC on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/battersea_arts\" title=\"\"><em>@battersea_arts</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In the village of Majdal Shams, about 40 miles from Damascus in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, support for President Bashar al-Assad is conspicuous.</p> <p>A Syrian flag flutters above the main square. Demonstrations backing the regime have attracted up to 5,000 people, drawn from a local Druze population of almost 20,000. Portraits of the Syrian president hang in the homes of pro-Assad activists.</p> <p>But, under the surface, there is uncertainty and dismay at what is happening in what most call \"the homeland\". A small minority of residents of the four villages populated by Syrian Druze high in the Golan have been open in their support for the uprising. But, they say, intimidation has stopped others speaking out.</p> <p>\"You have to be a fighter to survive [as an opponent of Assad] around here for the past 18 months,\" says Shefaa Abu Jabal, 26. When the rebellion began inside Syria in March 2011, a few residents of Majdal Shams organised a petition against the regime's brutal response. \"One hundred people signed it. But many said we must be loyal to the leader and asked people to withdraw their signatures.\" Under family pressure, nearly 17 signatories did so, says Abu Jabal.</p> <p>Quiet threats of social isolation followed, she says: dissidents were suddenly unwelcome at weddings and funerals. Others claim that apple farmers were warned that they might no longer be able to sell their crops in Syria if they were known to be Assad opponents; students feared they might be denied permits to resume studies in Damascus.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, a small gathering of anti-Assad activists in the main square was pelted with eggs and shoes, along with insults and curses. A restaurant, Aood al Nana, connected to an arts centre that had held an exhibition of anti-regime cartoons in May, was forced to close this month because of an unofficial boycott.</p> <p>The number of anti-Assad protesters taking to the streets has, at best, been a few dozen, says Abu Jabal. \"But they were going out in their thousands, chanting for Assad. This has isolated us more and more. We are afraid.\"</p> <p>Randa Maddah, 29, an artist who spent six years studying in Damascus, says: \"A lot of people here don't like the regime but can't speak out. Opposition is growing, but people are silent because of the mentality of the regime supporters.\"</p> <p>Abu Jabal and Maddah, along with almost everyone in Majdal Shams and its neighbouring villages, have relatives in Syria. The Golan Heights was seized from Syria by Israel in the 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognised by the international community. Few of its Druze population have taken Israeli citizenship and nearly all strongly identify themselves as Syrian.</p> <p>Until mobile phones, email and Skype became commonplace forms of communication, family members would yell greetings and news across the 1967 ceasefire line at what is known as \"Shouting Hill\", a spot on the edge of Majdal Shams where outlying village houses brush up against the boundary.</p> <p>In the years after occupation and annexation, many of the Druze \u2013 followers of a secretive splinter from Shia Islam \u2013 took part in militant actions against Israeli forces. Fathers, sons, brothers and cousins in many families have spent time in prison for such activities.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Druze population has been joined by about 20,000 Israeli Jewish settlers on the Golan Heights. Although Israel and Syria are still technically at war, the area is relatively calm. However, resentment over the Israeli occupation and identity with, and loyalty to, the homeland still figure strongly.</p> <p>This month, 86 Golan residents who were studying in Syria asked to return home early amid intensifying fighting. The students were reluctant to speak to the media about what they had witnessed, but Abu Jabal says she was told \"horrifying stories about violent attacks\" perpetrated by the regime. Maddah's sister, one of the returning students, told her of a dramatically worsening situation.</p> <p>Such accounts are dismissed by Assad supporters. \"The media is exploiting and exaggerating [events],\" says Ammad Maree, 33, who was born in Damascus but grew up in Majdal Shams. The Syrian army, he says, is \"defending the citizens and the legitimacy of the government\".</p> <p>Maree\u201a who named his three-year-old daughter Damascus, runs a website, baladee.net, which \"is now directed to support the regime\". He adds: \"I feel so hurt about what is happening [in Syria]. There is no way of expressing my feeling. But I have full trust in the Syrian leadership.\" Confronted with witness reports of shelling of civilians, he says: \"I condemn killing, but in war a lot of horrendous things happen. You have to ask why are they doing that? There must be a reason.\"</p> <p>Like others, he blames \"outsiders\", including the west, for stirring up trouble and unrest in Syria. In a home bedecked with pro-Assad paraphernalia, a 78-year-old apple grower, Salman al-Maqet, points the finger at \"conspirators\" and \"terrorists\".</p> <p>\"Before the current events, it was heaven [in Syria],\" he says, after a morning's work in his orchards. \"The ones doing the killing are terrorists \u2013 foreigners and Arabs from outside the country. The main conspirators are the west and Israel, and some of our neighbours\" \u2013 such as Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Maqet is informed about what's going on by Syrian state television. \"I only watch the homeland station. I only trust this station. Everything is under the control of the army and we are in good hands. There will be an end to this terrorism in Syria, even if it takes time,\" he says.</p> <p>The west, he says, must stop financing and arming \"the terrorists\" and end sanctions against the regime. His son, Busher, who served 25 years in an Israeli prison for resisting the occupation, similarly blames a western conspiracy to serve the interests of Israel in the Middle East. \"The only things the west cares about are oil and Israel,\" he says.</p> <p>Abu Jabal says the tension between pro- and anti-Assad supporters in Majdal Shams also has a generational dimension. \"The older, religious people are losing control. There has been huge change and they say young people have gone too far. If you want to live here, they say, you live according to our rules.</p> <p>\"The problem is not only that we are two groups, it's that they don't acknowledge my right to have different opinions. It's hard for them to accept me as a young, outspoken, educated woman.\"</p> <p>For now, most of the anti-Assad activists have retreated from the streets to Facebook and other internet forums. But, according to some, there is also clandestine activity: groups helping to smuggle supplies of food and medicines by circuitous routes into Syria.</p> <p>\"We were optimistic at the beginning,\" says Abu Jabal. But, she adds, the price of opposition is high in a small, close-knit community. \"It's a lot of pressure to handle. It's a war in this place.\"</p>",
  "<p>The American south-west has just witnessed a striking confluence of narratives. As millions of US TV-watchers popped popcorn and tucked in for the latest episode of the hit drug war drama <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.caravanforpeace.org/caravan/\" title=\"\">Caravan for Peace drove across Texas</a> telling a different story.</p> <p>Led by famed poet and journalist Javier Sicilia, the caravan is a fleet of buses, cars and campervans travelling 8,000km across the US to show how the war on drugs is tearing Mexico apart. The goal of this journey, which includes stops in 25 American cities, is to lend a human face to an epidemic of violence that is all too often portrayed as a one-dimensional conflict between crime and law enforcement. It is an ongoing disaster that unfortunately added another collection of bodies to its dead last weekend, when Mexican authorities discovered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/mexican-corpses-acapulco\" title=\"\">11 corpses along a road in Acapulco</a>.</p> <p>But it's a tough pitch. The stories being told by Sicilia and the caravan, those of the orphaned, widowed, displaced, maimed, missing and dead, are in competition with the aesthetic thrills of fictional works like Breaking Bad. While it would be unfair to frame Breaking Bad as <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/dea/\" title=\"\">DEA</a> propaganda or somehow opposed to drug policy reform, its thematic scope fits neatly into the drug warrior's rhetoric of morality and personal choice. In main protagonist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_%28Breaking_Bad%29\" title=\"\">Walter White</a>'s world, the meth market is occupied by Kierkegaardian anti-heroes with enough agency to decide their own fate. Indeed, his is a world where one's situation is predicated on individual choice, rather than economic determinism.</p> <p>The premise of Breaking Bad \u2013 that a middle-aged, educated white male would wilfully risk his life and the wellbeing of his family to become a crystal meth kingpin is, of course, the stuff of middle-class fantasy. The plausibility of an all-American drug empire has long given way to neoliberal market logic; <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/10/us-mexico-drugs-meth-idUSBRE84908820120510\" title=\"\">Mexican cartels</a> have taken over the meth business and are shipping in their precursor chemicals from front companies in China, Africa and Iraq, with lab labour often supplied by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11109404\" title=\"\">abducted migrant workers</a>. It's a highly entertaining fantasy no doubt, but it's also one that crudely uses drug violence as a flat aesthetic background for its comic-book-grade character flourishes. Whether or not the war on drugs is appropriate fodder for guiltless Sunday night entertainment is a matter of personal taste, though it would be difficult to imagine a similarly cartoonish show set in the suburbs of Damascus.</p> <p>The show is not just apolitical, it's anti-political in that it absolves politics of all responsibility and puts all responsibility on the shoulders of its characters. This makes for good TV, but it ignores the systemic conditions that allow violence to continue. In a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-hip-hop-lost-the-war-on-drugs/2012/07/13/gJQAlcsJiW_story.html\" title=\"\">recent piece</a> for the Washington Post on hip-hop and the war on drugs, American essayist Tour\u00e9 wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"When its audience was black, hip-hop embraced black nationalism, Afrocentrism and social consciousness; it was rebellious and almost always anti-drug. After the audience whitened, many MCs embraced criminality and sold the image of the criminalblackman. Black nationalism was out, embodying drug dealers was in. Hip-hop could have grown into a challenge to the war on drugs but instead accepted it as a fact of life and told bluesy, or braggadocious, stories about its part in it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's something similar going on in Breaking Bad. It's a form of pop-culture therapy that normalises drug violence and helps us to accept what's transpiring on the streets of Mexico and every major North American city as a naturally occurring phenomena. By ignoring the bit players of the war on drugs \u2013 those who, regardless of choice, still get sucked in and chewed up \u2013 it boils an extremely complex situation down to the sins of the individual. With the Caravan for Peace, <a href=\"http://drugpolicy.ca/2012/08/caravan-peace-dignity-justice/\" title=\"\">we have an antidote</a> to this severely distorted perspective. By touring with a group of people whose lives have been permanently damaged by circumstances beyond their control, Sicilia is offering an alternative interpretation of what the words \"drug war\" actually mean. A war that isn't really a war at all, but a cacophony of bad policies that has resulted in a relentless human rights disaster.</p> <p>It's the spectacle of America's bloody periphery brought to its doorstep. And above all, the Caravan for Peace demonstrates just how desperately we need a new narrative. One that gives equal screen time to the margins, because that's where most of those affected by drugs live and die.</p>",
  "<p>My friend Heinz Lubasz (known as Harry), who has died at the age of 83, was a historian of ideas who, in 1972, helped found the University of Essex's history department, which he later chaired.</p> <p>Born in Vienna, Harry gave little thought to his Jewish background until the Anschluss, when he was immediately subjected to the daily constraints heralding the \"Final Solution\", which he would later study. Harry benefited from the Kindertransport programme, spending the second world war in Britain. He flourished, but in May 1945 was called to join his parents in New York City, and undertook precarious and unhealthy work cutting industrial diamonds.</p> <p>A bout of pneumonia meant that he did his US military service in Germany not Korea, and, on demobilisation, he studied at Yale, gaining a PhD on 15th-century English law. Appointed to the history faculty at Brandeis University, Massachusetts, in 1960, Harry gave popular undergraduate courses on revolutions and fascism, being influenced by Herbert Marcuse, with whom he backed student protests against money offered to the university by the German Springer media group. Marcuse's contract was terminated, and Harry soon moved to Essex.</p> <p>During the 1970s, Harry published studies on Marx's writings of the 1840s and 1850s that challenged orthodox interpretations, and have yet to be surpassed. His 1992 essay on the misunderstanding of the term \"the invisible hand\" in the work of the political economist Adam Smith displayed equally close reading of the original. All this work employed what Harry called a \"genetic\" method, with a text being scrupulously analysed through its origins and context. This was also his approach after retirement in 1995 in seeking \"to find out what the hell the killers thought they were doing\" in the Holocaust. Against the run of recent literature, Harry believed this could not be determined, turning instead to the thoughts of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, as a philosophical tributary into nazism.</p> <p>The great love of Harry's life was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/apr/20/olivia-harris-obituary\" title=\"\">Olivia Harris</a>, with whom for 20 years he passionately shared a home, music, ideas and his fine cooking, and latterly the upbringing of their daughter, Marina. Olivia's early death meant that Harry, already 80, had to bring up an independent-minded teenager in a voluble and loving relationship. This, though, he did not do entirely alone, for Harry had a genius for friendship, drawing us all in with his deadpan style, and closing his mordant conclusions with a sparkle in his eyes.</p> <p>Marina survives him.</p>",
  "<h2>1) Manchester United 1-0 Southampton (FA Cup semi-final, 27 April 1963)</h2> <p>\"Only an outright fanatic would suggest that Manchester United are certain to beat Southampton,\" suggested the Guardian's Eric Todd ahead of this Villa Park semi-final in 1963. Saints were only a mid-table Second Division side at the time, but they were a club on an upward trajectory. United were still reeling from the horrors of Munich, and although their side was built around the British record signing Denis Law (\u00a3115,000) and a rejuvenated Bobby Charlton (recently the subject of a \u00a3300,000 bid from Barcelona), they were nevertheless battling relegation.</p> <p>\"The difference in league status counts for no more than does the fact that United have the costlier equipment,\" continued Todd. \"Southampton's Cup record is an imposing one ... United will not have things all their own way.\" Much expectation ahead of the game for Ted Bates's side, then, with their star man Terry Paine, David Burnside, George O'Brien and the flying winger John Sydenham expected to cause their more illustrious opponents bother. But they failed to turn up. Paine was \"feebly supported\" and \"not at his best\", while \"Ken Wimshurst had not the touch, Burnside was too erratic and O'Brien took his frustrations too hard\".</p> <p>\"Manchester United are fourth from the bottom of the First Division and played in a style appropriate to their position,\" sighed Todd, who added that \"Southampton are seventh from the bottom of the Second Division and also played to their league contest.\" The teams ground it out, United winning by a single Law goal, a hilariously scrappy effort: the Scottish striker attempted to head home from close range, missed the ball altogether like a drunk sticking the nut on fresh air in the car park of an Aberdonian pub, and then toe-poked the loose ball home.</p> <p>The goal had come after 22 minutes. What followed was so bad that one punter, who had shimmied up a floodlight pylon to get a better view, came down with 30 minutes still to play, preferring to be handcuffed and led away by the police than suffer any more of the fare being offered up. So, in itself, hardly a classic worth remembering. And yet along with the final \u2013 which they certainly were expected to lose against championship near-misses Leicester City \u2013 it represents a real turning point in United's history. Their post-Munich hoodoo was put to bed, and not for the last time, a game against Southampton marked the end of a lean spell and set in motion an era of great success.</p> <h2>2) Southampton 2-5 Manchester United (First Division, 27 November 1971)</h2> <p>So then George Best came, bringing domestic and European titles with him, and soon enough George Best went. The easy version of the Best story finishes at Wembley in 1968, after which United go into steady decline, the winger eventually buggering off to sample the delights of hedonism, like you wouldn't do it too. That ignores, however, a quite incredible Indian summer for the player in the autumn of 1971. An Indian summer being a preposterous description for the acts of a 25-year-old, but this is what we've been left to deal with.</p> <p>Indeed, a large proportion of Best's best \u2013 signature moments caught in the garish living colour of classic-era Match of the Day \u2013 came during this season. He scored <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow0Hbokc9F4\" title=\"\">a plasma-kneading hat-trick against West Ham</a>. He was the star man in a 2-2 draw at Anfield. He frustrated Manchester City so much in a 3-3 stalemate at Maine Road that Francis Lee found himself performing that brazen accusatory swan dive, one of the genuine slapstick moments in All Sport. He went on <em>that</em> meander against Sheffield United, left to right, shoulders as yo-yos, so repeatedly did he drop them to amble past his man, before threading the ball home. Along with a similarly excitable Law and Charlton \u2013 both ageing heroes enjoying proper pukka Indian summers \u2013 Best led Frank O'Farrell's side to the top of the tree by Christmas.</p> <p>The match at Southampton was arguably the crowning glory of the run. Saints were by now a First Division side and a decent one at that \u2013 they, and specifically Ted MacDougall, had given United a proper smack in the mouth in August 1969, a 4-1 spanking at Old Trafford \u2013 but this was old men against boys. We would be doing you a disservice if we didn't leave the description of Best's hat-trick in a 5-2 win to the Guardian's relentlessly majestic Frank Keating, who was at the Dell to witness an \"extravagant pleasure\".</p> <p>\"In the first minutes Best bent to flick Kidd's cross past Martin with less trouble than he takes over his hair any morning ... after the interval Best trapped it, shook one hip to send McGrath slithering right, the other to send Martin airily left and planted the ball precisely between them ... then Gabriel blocked Best's approach but the little man somehow squeezed it upwards and into the net with his head, off the post ... when he left the field 20 minutes from the end, he was given a standing salute [by a crowd that] was only partisan for the opening moments.\"</p> <p>O'Farrell's side fell off the pace disastrously during the second half of the season, quite literally, the older chaps in the team running out of puff around Best. But this was a performance worth remembering, yet is so often forgotten. \"Best covered up a multitude of sins,\" recalled his manager. \"After some games we won when we shouldn't have I used to say 'Thank God for George'.\"</p> <h2>3) Southampton 1-0 Manchester United (FA Cup final, 1 May 1976)</h2> <p>Hey pop kids!!! Anyone for some raging pro-United Guardian bias?!? You <em>love</em> it, you lot, don't you? Gertcha! Here goes, then, with the leader column of the Guardian on the morning of the 1976 FA Cup final between Manchester United and Southampton. \"A newspaper can sit quite comfortably astride any convenient fence and say, for example, that though Manchester United are a glamorous footballing side, nevertheless Southampton have the romance of the underdog to set alongside the talent of Channon. Or vice versa. Wembley today, however, is no occasion for vice or versa. Manchester must win. A loss will be a disaster ... Throughout the season, dismantling dour defence after dour defence, United have sent a dozen managers back to the drawing board. The repercussions, exhilarating already, will gain permanence if Manchester United gain a major trophy. Football will win if they win.\"</p> <p>Imagine if this newspaper \u2013 if any newspaper \u2013 had the chutzpah to publish something like this today. The bottom half of the internet would shear off and frisbee away into outer space, powered solely by the hot heat of disproportionate outrage, never to return. Something which may or may not give our current leader writers pause. But back in the day, opinions were tolerated in the adult fashion. David Lacey, while acknowledging the skills of Mick Channon, Jim McCalliog, Peter Osgood and Paul Gilchrist, suggested that \"evenness of talent is not Southampton's strength\" and that they would in all probability \"bow to the inevitability of Manchester's speed and accuracy ... the outcome appears to be a question of how rather than who \u2013 a dangerous presumption, as Sunderland demonstrated in 1973.\"</p> <p>A dangerous presumption indeed, as Lacey recognised after Bobby Stokes had fizzed home a late winner \u2013 destined to remain forever an offside controversy thanks to shaky camerawork \u2013 to stun Wembley and the wider world. \"There were even those who felt that a win for Southampton might be bad for football because it would mean a stifling of Manchester's ingenuity and a reaffirmation that at the last defensive methods brought the best rewards. The course of the game did not bear this out. Certainly those who had come along on a sunny May Day hoping to be enthralled by a pageant of United's talents were disappointed, but Southampton created more scoring opportunities and while their play was based on a broad defensive platform, in no way could their performance be described as negative.\"</p> <p>United's league season had petered out spectacularly \u2013 the title was in their hands at the end of March, but they ended the season trailing Liverpool and QPR after unexpected defeats to Ipswich and Stoke City \u2013 and their Cup challenge ended rather lamely too. They started off the stronger side, but were continually caught offside, losing heart quickly. Sammy McIlroy hit the bar with a header, but that was the sum total of their efforts in the final. In the first half, McCalliog sent Channon clear with a raking pass down the middle. Alex Stepney saved, but could do nothing when McCalliog repeated the trick for Stokes on 84 minutes. It would not be the last time Saints humbled United in the FA Cup \u2013 in 1992, Tim Flowers famously went on a demented pitch-long celebratory charge after his side triumphed in the first FA Cup penalty shootout involving top-flight teams, having been slightly fortunate to hold United to a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford, Bryan Robson heading home a ghost goal, unnoticed by the officials \u2013 but this was the big one.</p> <p>Southampton were welcomed back to the city by a crowd of 175,000 as their team bus wound its way through the streets for 19 miles. United, too, were whisked to a civic reception, though their nine-mile tour was rather more muted. \"With no cup to wave,\" reported the Guardian, \"United had a flat cardboard replica fastened to the front of their bus instead.\" What the paper's leader writer thought of this \"glamorous\" state of affairs is not known.</p> <h2>4) Southampton 4-1 Manchester United (Littlewoods Cup replay, 4 November 1986)</h2> <p>Unquestionably the most important defeat in Manchester United's history. Ron Atkinson's side had thrown away the league the season before; after winning the first 10 games on the bounce, they somehow managed to end up fourth in a one-horse race behind Liverpool, Everton and West Ham United. The hangover was severe; they started the 1986-87 season poorly. Abysmally, in fact: after their first nine matches, they were joint bottom of the table, having lost to Arsenal, West Ham, Charlton, Watford, Everton and Chelsea. Their only victory was a 5-1 skittering of Southampton at Old Trafford, and even then the Guardian reported that Big Ron had the look of \"a man who had just discovered a mouse in his pork pie\".</p> <p>United's form was certainly hard to swallow, though after that start they improved with back-to-back wins against Sheffield Wednesday and Luton Town, before drawing at Manchester City. But the team were still in relegation bother and still had a fragile underbelly. And in a Littlewoods Cup third-round replay at the Dell, Southampton thrashed United silly. With an ageing Jimmy Case imperious in midfield, Saints blew their visitors away. George Lawrence opened the scoring in the first half with a 20-yard smash. On 71 minutes, Danny Wallace was set up by Colin Clarke to make it 2-0. Then an 18-year-old forward called Matthew Le Tissier turned up to unveil an art piece called harbinger: he scored his first club goal with a saucy lob over Chris Turner, then added a fourth with a close-range header. Peter Davenport pulled a wholly pointless goal back for United, but Big Ron's days were numbered.</p> <p>We all know what happened next. A quick nod, though, to Fergie's first game in charge of United against the Saints. All eyes were on Mark Dennis, Southampton's robust full back, who was in hot water with the FA for repeated disciplinary problems. So it was with some surprise that Dennis was the victim in what was then the fastest top-flight sending off of all time. United's Liam O'Brien was the recipient of the red card, after 85 seconds, for splitting Dennis's shin pad. Nick Holmes put Saints ahead on four minutes, Jesper Olsen equalised in 11 and the game was momentarily stopped soon after for a spot of brawling in the stands. The remaining 75 minutes were a total non-event. Fergie's reaction to O'Brien's dismissal? \"It was a bad decision.\" Le Tissier's wasn't the last harbinger of the era, then.</p> <h2>5) Southampton 3-1 Manchester United (13 April 1996); Southampton 6-3 Manchester United (26 October 1996); Southampton 1-0 Manchester United (19 January 1998)</h2> <p>A quite amazing triptych, given Southampton's perpetual struggles against relegation during this period, and United having become firmly established as the best team in the land by some considerable distance. The first is famous for <em>those</em> grey kits. \"The players don't like the grey strip,\" claimed Sir Alex Ferguson, after his team changed into blue and white for the second half of their match at the Dell, having shipped three goals. \"They find it difficult to pick each other out. We had to change the strip.\" A much mocked act, but then sports stars have a habit of making psychological mountains out of molehills, and United's record over four matches in the shirts was nothing short of appalling: losses at Aston Villa, Arsenal, Liverpool and a draw at Nottingham Forest. And it could be argued that United's improved second-half performance in their third strip won them the title. This defeat allowed Newcastle to within three points of them at the top, the Toon with a game in hand. But goal difference was a factor at the time, and it could be argued that another 45 minutes of grey hell could have tipped the advantage from United to Newcastle and affected the sides during the run-in. Clever Fergie, even if he was making it all up on the spot.</p> <p>The most outrageous scoreline and incident-packed game is the one sandwiched in the middle. United lost Roy Keane \u2013 looking feral in a wild beard \u2013 to two yellow cards. A slightly harsh decision \u2013 he was booked for dissent, then a marginally late tackle on Claus Lundekvam \u2013 but United could have had few complains, as Eric Cantona really should have walked for an all-out kick-and-punch assault on the mountainous Ulrich van Gobbel (followed by triple pike with salchow dive to floor). Saints manager Graeme Souness, who knows a thing or two about starting rammies, showed a far-from-grudging admiration of the United striker's work: \"I saw who he was involved with. He must be very brave.\" Ten-man United threatened an outrageous comeback inspired by the tireless work of David Beckham, but at 3-2 a stunning Eyal Berkovic volley put paid to that, the first goal of four scored in the final seven minutes. Egil Ostenstad was a hat-trick hero for Saints, although one goal was later pettily taken off him and awarded to Gary Neville instead, but as usual it mattered little, for Matthew Le Tissier was the real star turn. Turning David May and Gary Pallister, he lifted a ludicrous chip up and over Peter Schmeichel. \"It might scrape into my top 10,\" yawned Le Tiss later.</p> <p>That result came off the back of United's 5-0 loss at Newcastle, and would be followed by a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea at Old Trafford. It was the first time United had lost three on the spin in the Premier League era. Eleven goals in seven days, for United it felt like the roof was caving in. But of course they regrouped to win the title easily. So it's somewhat eyebrow-raising to note that perhaps the least interesting match of these three was the one with the most repercussions for United. The third win in a row for Saints at the Dell came courtesy of an early Kevin Davies strike, augmented by a long series of Paul Jones saves. Had United won, they would have gone eight clear of nearest challengers Blackburn Rovers \u2013 and 14 points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal. As it was? \"It's given people hope, and that's a nice Christian thing to do.\" He was aware the door had been left ajar by his side, unravelling slowly without his injured pivot Keane. Ars\u00e8ne knew, but so did Fergie. Clever Fergie.</p> <h2>6) Southampton 1-3 Manchester United (22 April 2000)</h2> <p>After all that Dell misery, United deserved something from the tatty yet gorgeous old place before it was razed to the ground. And so it came in 2000, the culmination of the first proper cakewalk in the English top flight since Liverpool had waltzed to the title in 1983 with 26 days to spare. United retained their title with four games still remaining, sealing the deal on a drama-free afternoon at the Dell.</p> <p>Mesmeric as an attacking force, as they had been for the entire season, they were out of sight before 30 minutes had been played. David Beckham opened the scoring with a free kick, Phil Neville forced an own goal out of Saints stalwart Francis Benali, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer added a third on 29 minutes. Marian Pahars pulled back a late consolation, but the result was payback for an embarrassing afternoon for United earlier in the season, a 3-3 draw which saw Pahars do the unthinkable by nutmegging Jaap Stam, Le Tissier embarrass Massimo Taibi with the softest of shots and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFAGx7RDL4#t=1m10s\" title=\"\">Paul Jones make the Greatest But Most Futile save of all time</a>.</p> <p>And even then United weren't quite happy. Three days earlier, they'd allowed themselves to be hustled out of the European Cup by Fernando Redondo and Real Madrid in the European Cup. A needless defeat given the respective quality of the two sides at the time \u2013 Madrid finished fifth in La Liga that season \u2013 and one which slightly soured their celebrations. Or the celebrations of one man, at least. \"Even though we won the Premiership easily, there was a serious danger that we were fooling ourselves. We had failed to defend the Champions League ... Defeat by Real Madrid was OK, because you couldn't do it every year. Why not? Liverpool did. Real did. Juventus did. Bayern did. I kept my mouth shut. Except to family and close friends.\" No need to insult your intelligence by naming the man whose biography we're quoting from, is there?</p>",

He suggested it was a bad idea for lawyers to become presidents \u2013 Romney, like Obama, is a graduate of Harvard law school. Abraham Lincoln was also one.</p> <p>At one point, he spoke about dismissing Obama and making a change.</p> <p>\"When somebody doesn't do the job, you've got to let them go,\" Eastwood said, drawing a finger across his throat. A speech that was supposed to last five minutes lasted nearly 12.</p> <p>The Obama campaign hit back afterwards by tweeting a photo of the back of the president's chair, with Obama's head showing over the top of it, along with the line: \"This seat's taken.\" Other tweets were ruder. \"20 years ago I wanted Clint Eastwood to make my day. Now I just want him to take his pills and be grateful he doesn't need Medicare,\" said Nancy Lee Grahn, from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital\" title=\"\">General Hospital</a> television show.</p> <p>\"I can't believe I just watched Clint Eastwood turn into somebody's DRUNK UNCLE HARRY on the stage of the GOP RNC.

  "<p>Each week we look at two shops competing in the same sector, and review what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are to the best bargains on offer.</p> <p>Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing.</p> <p>To get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops.</p> <p>Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job; other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend.</p> <p>This week, we compare supermarket giants Asda and Morrisons.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.morrisons.co.uk/\" title=\"Morrisons website\">Morrisons</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> The Morrisons brand dates back to 1899, when William Morrison&#xa0;started working as an egg and butter merchant in Bradford. He expanded into market stalls in the local area and in 1958 Morrisons opened its first self-service shop in the city.</p> <p>Business boomed under the control of William's son Ken, and it purchased rival supermarket chain Safeway in 2004 in order to expand its presence in Scotland and the south of England. It currently has about 450 stores.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 10.30am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Groceries and homewares.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> My eyes were immediately drawn to an amazing display of fresh fruit and vegetables on beds of ice at the front of the store, with cold mist&#xa0;sprays built into the shelves to keep the produce fresh. Around the edge of the store were counters serving fresh fish, meats, pastries and cakes, as well as a popular salad bar. There was a dedicated area for upmarket, yet competitively priced ready meals, while groceries took up most of the centre of the store and freezer aisles occupied the rear.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Chatty. From the older woman at the deli counter to the young man at the tills, everyone seemed eager to have a natter.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> Four medium white baps for 32p.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Onions, \u00a31.05 a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash,&#xa0;\u00a31; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.99; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 530ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.65 (or two for \u00a32).</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were 22 tills in the store, nine of which were manned. Customers also had the option of using one of the six self-service tills or a small kiosk selling newspapers and cigarettes near the entrance.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> An impressive experience. Although not a vast superstore, this branch of Morrisons contained a good selection of products and had an excellent range of special offers, both on the end of the aisles and dotted around the store. Outside of food, it also had a children's clothing section as well as a small but solid range of household appliances and homewares.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 8/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.asda.com/\" title=\"Asda website\">Asda</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Founded in Leeds in 1949, Asda has since grown into a retailing behemoth. The chain operated predominantly in the north of England until an expansion programme in the early 1990s enhanced its reach. It was bought by American retailing giant Wal-Mart in 1999 and now operates about 300 UK superstores alongside a number of smaller convenience and non-food stores.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 11.45am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Groceries, clothing and homeware.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> This two-level store offered a massive range of products in a bright, airy atmosphere. The mezzanine level contained a cafe, homewares and a large clothing section, while the ground floor contained a pharmacy, home electronics and a comprehensive range of groceries.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> The checkout staff were quick and pleasant, with plenty more stacking shelves and fielding customer queries.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> A pack of four standard tins of Heinz tomato soup for \u00a32.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Onions, 90p a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash,&#xa0;\u00a31.39; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.98; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 433ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.25.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were 25 standard tills, of which 11 were manned, with a further eight self-service machines and a newspaper kiosk also available.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> Asda's store was huge \u2013 perhaps too big \u2013 taking a considerable amount of time to walk around its two levels. But that allowed it to stock a vast range of products, all competitively priced against other major supermarkets \u2013 a point the in-store advertising made abundantly clear.</p> <p>While it was busy, the store remained easy to navigate thanks to the wide aisles and good signposting on the lower level. Upstairs, Asda's non-food selection was excellent, with a wide enough range of George clothing to fill a shop of its own.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict</strong> Asda contained numerous posters detailing how much cheaper they are than other supermarkets, which generally seemed to be the case, although several products were just a penny cheaper than Morrisons and the latter came out top when it came to its special offers.</p> <p>Morrisons also outclassed Asda when it came to the range of fresh products on offer, from the impressive fruit and veg stands to the bakery and fish counter, where a dedicated fishmonger was on hand to give advice and prepare fish to order.</p> <p>Outside of food, Asda's range of clothing and electrical goods was comprehensive. This was an area where Morrisons was unable to match its rival, although a range of basic appliances and kids clothing added some variation to its store.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>In the battle of the takeaway pizza retailers Domino was king, taking 46% of your votes. Rival Pizza Hut was the preferred choice of just 20% of voters, with the remainder saying they would choose another pizzeria entirely.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17876162\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">WelshPaul</a> sang the praises of a good alternative near where he lives:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Our local independent pizza takeaway offers a superb range of toppings: capers, spinach, smoked salmon, blue cheese, anchovies and parmesan to name but a few, and their prices are always at least 3/4 those of the local Dominos a few doors down. I'm baffled why so many people opt for the Americanised pizza giants, whose pizzas are often greasy montrosities (Cheese-stuffed crust? Really?).\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17876894\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">Slowmotion</a> spoke up for Dominos' customer service, if not the pizza:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Domino's online service is really good - you get to see how your pizza is progressing (\"ah, they've just taken it out of the oven, maybe i should get out of bed now\"), delivery is quick and the staff are really friendly. i actually detest the pizza with a passion but when you're hungry and lazy it does a great job.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17881355\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">Shuggah</a>, meanwhile, liked the food:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I would go Domino's every time. They simply taste better. Pizza Hut also pretends to be a proper restaraunt serving nice food whereas Domino's do not. Their large pepperoni passion is gloriously filthy, bad and wrong. It tastes amazing and only contains about two days worth of calories. Once a year for Domino's, never for Pizza Hut.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>However, price was a recurring theme with many people saying they didn't think either chain's fare warranted the cost.</p> <p>Let us know which of today's retailers you favour, or if you aren't a fan of either or think another offers better choice or prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=503f7ddce4b00ec5b7e776f1\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=503f7ddce4b00ec5b7e776f1\"></script><a class=\"OPP-powered-by\" href=\"http://www.objectplanet.com/opinio/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><div style=\"font: 9px arial; color: gray;\">survey services</div></a> </figure>  <p></p>",
  "<p>It's fantastic that a Conservative thinktank wants to build more social homes. The big idea from the Policy Exchange is to sell off expensive social homes and use the cash it generates to build lots of cheaper ones. On the face of it this sounds good: there are loads of places where landlords have knocked down crumbling estates and replaced these with more homes of higher quality. Why not repeat this everywhere? Yet, for the first time in my life, I am criticising someone that wants to build more homes. Here's why.</p> <p>This report is a crass example of the politics of envy. It kicks off with pictures of four highend London homes. What's the point of that? The authors want you to share their disgust that council tenants live in these properties.</p> <p>I can see why some may feel jealous of those living in million-pound council homes. But why is a Tory thinktank so bothered about it? Conservative prime minister John Major created the National Lottery, and anyone can become a millionaire that way (the media pounces on winners that are benefit cheats or sex offenders). The party is also happy to offer a bung of \u00a375,000 if you buy your council house. It's hardly a constant line on unearned riches; at one time the Tories were thrusting warriors for free enterprise.</p> <p>Using council tenants as the scapegoat for a lack of council housing is bad enough, but there are other flaws with this report. Policy Exchange seems to me a bit giddy with its own genius. The author asks himself why no one has thought of sell to build before. They have; Dame Shirley Porter pioneered the idea of selling council homes and moving the homeless elsewhere. For years housing associations sold new homes to fund homes for rent, before the credit crunch got in the way.</p> <p>In another unusual step, it is the civil servants who get it in the neck for not inventing the policy. That's a bit rich \u2013 under localism it is up to each council to decide what to do. Councils now have power over their own housing revenue accounts, so they can make the most of their assets. Let's leave them to it.</p> <p>Compelling landlords to sell high value homes as they fall vacant might mean they go on sale at the wrong time. The International Monetary Fund is predicting a fall in UK house prices. As we would expect a Conservative to say, deciding when to sell should be a matter for the landlord, not central government.</p> <p>Selling off expensive homes to build more homes for rent is a good idea. There is plenty of scope to do this by redeveloping poor quality estates on high value land. By law, existing tenants have a lot of say over this. They are not going to agree to anything while the cloud of a purge of poor people in rich areas hangs over their heads. This Policy Exchange paper has done damage, slowing down house building rather than speeding it up. </p> <p><em>Alistair McIntosh is chief executive of the </em><a href=\"http://www.hqnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Housing Quality Network</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice tailored to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Tottenham Hotspur are considering whether to make a deadline-day bid for the Porto midfielder Jo\u00e3o Moutinho which, if accepted, would break the club's transfer record, although the manager Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas maintained that he could see no way of the deal happening.</p> <p>Villas-Boas remains open to the possibility of selling the defender Michael Dawson, despite the \"massive, massive blow\" of Youn\u00e8s Kaboul's knee operation that has ruled him out for four months, and the sale would raise funds for the pursuit of Moutinho, as would that of Rafael van der Vaart to Hamburg. Villas-Boas suggested that the German club had disrespected Tottenham with their opening offer.</p> <p>Jermain Defoe, meanwhile, has signed a new three-year contract at White Hart Lane to end the uncertainty over his future. Villas-Boas has said that he wants to play the season with three strikers in his squad, with one of them being the 19-year-old Harry Kane and another, Emmanuel Adebayor, who re-signed for the club on a permanent basis last week. While Tottenham pushed for Leandro Dami\u00e3o, the Brazil and Internacional No9, Defoe found a question mark against his name. But he has now agreed fresh terms to 2015.</p> <p>Tottenham have become synonymous with late drama in the transfer market but a move for Moutinho would set new standards. Villas-Boas, who worked with the player during his time in charge of Porto and has made no secret of his admiration for him, shifted in his seat when asked whether Tottenham were still in talks over him. \"At this moment, I can't tell you,\" he said.</p> <p>But he was pessimistic about the chances of a deal, pointing out that Porto always sold players at very high prices and that Moutinho had a \u20ac40m (\u00a332m) buyout clause in his contract, even if that does not preclude him from being sold for less.</p> <p>\"It's practically impossible \u2026 it's an impossible deal for the club,\" Villas-Boas said. \"You have to bear in mind that this is a player with a \u20ac40m release clause and Tottenham's most expensive signing was [Luka] Modric [for \u00a316.6m from Dinamo Zagreb]. This is a key player for club and country. You wouldn't say that you would get him at half the price and half the price is already beating Tottenham's transfer record.</p> <p>\"I have never hidden that he is a player of tremendous qualities, there are only a few players who can come in straight away to a team and have a direct impact. Only world-class players could do that and he is certainly one of them but it doesn't mean that it's within our reach.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas hopes to complete the \u00a313m signing of the Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, although the deal was in jeopardy on Thursday night when the French club accused the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, of lowering his offer by \u00a32m. The clubs had settled on the fee last Sunday but Lyon took to their official website to state that they had \"not reached an agreement with Tottenham for the transfer of Hugo Lloris\".</p> <p>The statement continued: \"Proposals submitted by Tottenham tonight are significantly distant from the one which was officially offered on 26 August and had opened up discussions between the player and the London club.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas retains an interest in the Shakhtar Donetsk attacking midfielder Willian but, again, there have been difficulties in finalising the transfer. When Villas-Boas discussed Willian, for whom Tottenham have had an \u00a311m bid rejected, he gave a positive name-check to the club's young attacking midfielder Andros Townsend who, he said, had had an \"amazing game for the under-21s against Manchester United\".</p> <p>\"We had initial contact with Shakhtar [over Willian],\" Villas-Boas said. \"Again, [they are] a club with wealthy owners, not easy to deal with. We can't say that it's over but we have approached the club and the players with contacts and, at the moment, it doesn't seem to happen.\"</p> <p>Tottenham have resorted to surgery for Kaboul as the condition of his knee had steadily deteriorated over the past three months and what Villas-Boas described as \"conservative treatment\" had not provided the answer. But Villas-Boas said that Kaboul's absence had changed nothing with regard to Dawson's status at the club.</p> <p>Villas-Boas does not want more than four centre-halves in his squad and he considers Dawson to be his fifth-choice, behind Kaboul, William Gallas, Jan Vertonghen and Steven Caulker. He made Dawson available for transfer earlier in the month, even though he knew that the prognosis on Kaboul was bleak. Tottenham accepted a \u00a39m offer for Dawson from Queens Park Rangers, only for him to turn down the move.</p> <p>\"We obviously allowed the player to have talks with QPR and [back] then, we knew about Younes's situation,\" Villas-Boas said. \"We made the player [Dawson] aware of that situation [with Kaboul's injury]. There is a problem to meet the player's expectations regarding their playing time when you have four central defenders of this calibre and one injured.\"</p> <p>Defoe announced on Twitter that he had signed his new contract and the club later said they were \"delighted\" at the development. The striker has 119 goals in 300 appearances for them. They have been less pleased, though, at Hamburg's attempt to re-sign Van der Vaart. Levy values Van der Vaart at \u00a314m and Hamburg have offered significantly less.</p> <p>\"We have had interest from Hamburg,\" Villas-Boas said, \"but for a player of Rafa's dimension \u2026 it's not something that the player deserves, an offer of that dimension.

This is what has fuelled my desire to study international relations at university and embark on a career in politics \u2013 an area that has interested me since the age of 12.</p> <p>I'm currently studying A Levels in government and politics, modern history, English language and law at Cardinal Newman College, in Preston.</p> <p>Having embraced my passion for politics, and my desire to enter the political work field, my politics teacher informed me about the Whitehall internship, which he believed would help my future prospects. When I found out about it my initial reaction was to find out more and apply.</p> <p>The aim of the internship, set up by the <a href=\"http://www.socialmobility.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Mobility Foundation</a>, is to promote social mobility and increase civil service diversity by targeting under-represented groups. It's an aim which is supported by Baroness Warsi, minister without portfolio, who showed her enthusiasm for the internship at our opening ceremony. Head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake, who fully supports this scheme and who I got to meet, has also spoken up about how important it is for the civil service to be diverse.</p> <p>From numerous applicants, 60 year 12 students were chosen to participate in the scheme. All of us were split across the different government departments in Whitehall. I was allocated to the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) where I worked in the office of Peter Schofield, director general of neighbourhoods. The department has had heavy focus in the media in recent weeks <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/may/25/mary-portas-pilot-wolverhampton-award\" title=\"\">due to the Portas pilot scheme</a>, tackling council tax fraud as well as looking how economic growth can be increased via the regeneration of cities.</p> <p>During my time at DCLG I went to a variety of meetings, shadowing both directors and director generals who were discussing how to tackle the issue of economic growth. I was also given the chance to shadow Andrew Stunnell, parliamentary under secretary of state, at a meeting and then attend a question and answer session where I was able to find out more about minister's workloads and the type of jobs they have to complete day to day.</p> <p>Having attended these meetings and met such influential people, I gained an insiders knowledge of what it was like to work for the civil service and the pressures placed upon civil servants. Furthermore, I was also able to shadow members of DCLG's legal team and also meet litigation lawyers at the Treasury's solicitors department as well visit the supreme court. The people that I communicated with have stimulated me to widen my horizons and aim high. They were all immensely encouraging and helpful, and were always willing to answer any questions that I had.</p> <p>Being in the environment that, in the future, I would like to work in was astounding. I was able to learn more about the civil service and the different career options within it. All the information that I obtained was enormously beneficial and helped me come to the decision that I would like to become a fast streamer in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office once I have graduated.</p> <p>The experience has been overwhelming, inspiring and definitely enriching and I would recommend everyone, especially those interested in politics, to apply.</p> <p><em>Endrita Salihu is 17 and studying for her A Levels at Cardinal Newman College in Preston.

  "<p>The Tate's last exhibition of pre-Raphaelite art, held in a now distant 1984, was a rather dully chronological affair. According to one critic, the treatment \"seemed to symbolise a newly conservative reading of the pre-Raphaelites\". Greenery-yallery to Laura Ashley. A press photograph shows Margaret Thatcher at the opening alongside <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hughes-april-love-n02476\" title=\"\">Arthur Hughes's <em>April Love</em></a>. With 250 exhibits this was a catch-all survey. I remember emerging from it reeling with exhaustion. It succeeded in what one might have thought would be impossible. It managed to make the pre-Raphaelites bland.</p> <p>The current exhibition will be altogether different: leaner, more thematic, more politically charged. Women will be better represented. (Not difficult, considering that only two paintings by one woman, Elizabeth Siddal, were included in 1984.) Alongside pre-Raphaelite paintings and drawings will be sculpture, photography and prize examples of pre-Raphaelite furniture and textiles, emphasising the wide reach of a movement that was fiercely revolutionary in its aims.</p> <p>So what exactly was the <a href=\"http://www.pre-raphaelitesociety.org/index.htm\" title=\"\">pre-Raphaelite brotherhood</a>? Forget the bodice-ripping TV drama <em>Desperate Romantics</em>, which belittled the pre-Raphaelites as sexual desperadoes. These were ardent, ambitious and serious artists and poets. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais were the leaders of the movement formed in 1848. The pre-Raphaelite brotherhood embodied protest. William Morris was later to describe it as a \"really audacious attempt\" to reject the prevailing academic forms of art in favour of truth to nature. It was an audacity that applied to literature as much as to painting and the decorative arts.</p> <p>They called themselves pre-Raphaelites defiantly, taking up the purist values of pre-renaissance art of the period immediately before Raphael, drawing on the past to make their own mid 19th-century artistic revolution. We need to remember these were still very young men. Holman Hunt was 21, Rossetti only 20, Millais just 19. They formed a cohesive in-group, shutting out the unbelievers. Their dazzling manifesto on the true meaning of art proved terribly obscure to both the critics and the public.</p> <p>They were clever and sardonic. Their irreverence still makes them seem curiously modern. Alison Smith, co-curator of the Tate exhibition, is surely right in seeing the pre-Raphaelites as the first modern art movement and in subtitling her show \"Victorian Avant-Garde\". They were radical in their ways of looking, viewing their subjects with an intense psychological acumen. They were radical, too, in their techniques of painting. That pre-Raphaelite super-realism was achieved through meticulous attention to detail. The artists preferred painting outside the studio, the strange and often shocking candour of their vision exaggerated by the effects of natural light.</p> <p>The brotherhood was wonderfully wilful and obsessive. In the middle 1850s Holman Hunt spent two years working in the Holy Land. The weirdest and most controversial painting he returned with was <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/pre-raphaelites/scapegoat/\" title=\"\"><em>The Scapegoat</em></a>. The background had been painted in situ on the shores of the Dead Sea, site of the city of abominations, Sodom, while the goat itself was posed back in Jerusalem, standing in a tray of salt crystals and authentic Dead Sea mud. Hunt's complex symbolism bemused and angered people. If we can compare 1850s PRBs and 1990s YBAs (and in terms of shock value we definitely can) then <em>The Scapegoat</em> finds its obvious parallel in Damien Hirst's shark.</p> <p>PRBs were avant-garde in undermining the expected. Millais's painting <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-christ-in-the-house-of-his-parents-the-carpenters-shop-n03584\" title=\"\"><em>Christ in the House of His Parents</em></a> was seen as sacrilegious on account of its extreme verisimilitude and quirkiness. The conventional saccharine quality of Victorian religious art was absent. Millais's Christ child, shown with a symbolic bleeding palm, was described by Charles Dickens as \"a hideous, wry-necked, blubbering, red-haired boy in a nightgown\" who appeared to have received a poke playing in an adjacent gutter, while his kneeling mother \"would stand out from the rest of the company as a monster in the vilest cabaret in France or in the lowest gin-shop in England\".</p> <p>The pre-Raphaelite father figure Ford Madox Brown was indignantly attacked for <a href=\"http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1956P9\" title=\"\"><em>The Pretty Baa-Lambs</em></a>, an unsentimentalised plein air painting of his raw-red-cheeked wife and little daughter, derided by one critic as \"a facetious experiment\". Brown had broken the rules of domestic guardedness. The pre-Raphaelite artists were not afraid to tackle such problematic topics as poor law legislation, prostitution or the prevailing sexual double standards. They were pioneers in the way that they embedded moral meaning within the visual message. What was startlingly unusual was their sheer conviction that art could alter society itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395471187\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346240020136/Edward-Burne-Jones-008.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Burne-Jones. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edward Burne-Jones was a neurotic teenager in Birmingham when the brotherhood was formed. William Morris was \u2013 unhappily \u2013 at boarding school at Marlborough. But in the late 1850s, when they both arrived in London, they were absorbed into pre-Raphaelite circles as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Rossetti. It was with this second generation of pre-Raphaelites that the movement reached its true maturity. Why has this not been recognised before?</p> <p>One reason is the long-prevailing snobbery among art historians and curators in giving higher status to pictures than to objects. Previous pre-Raphaelite shows have focused entirely on paintings and drawings in spite of the fact that one of the main planks of pre-Raphaelite reform was a call for unity of all the arts. The young reformers argued that architecture, furniture, wallpaper and textiles, illustrated books should stand in equal status with \"travelling pictures\", as Burne-Jones rudely termed them. These ideas were later to be widely influential on the arts and crafts movement and indeed the bauhaus, as the recent exhibition at the Barbican so brilliantly showed.</p> <p>Pre-Raphaelite politics have also been evaded. In previous surveys the political ferocity that fuelled these angry young men of mid-Victorian Britain has been considered far beyond the remit of curatorial politesse. In 1996, on the centenary of Morris's death, when the V&amp;A held a massive Morris exhibition, his socialist activities were crammed apologetically into a small corner. And yet it would be argued by those who know their Morris that politics were the very essence of the man.</p> <p>The new exhibition promises for the first time to give serious attention to the politics of art and the shimmering contradictions of a movement that combined the love of history, mythology and the classics with scientific study of natural phenomena and scathing contempt for the contemporary scene. These contradictions meet most spectacularly in the work of Burne-Jones, whose reputation, once so dire that in 1942 the Tate was able to buy <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-love-and-the-pilgrim-n05381\" title=\"\"><em>Love and the Pilgrim</em></a> for \u00a342, is now on something of a roll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395471188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346239573136/William-Morriss-four-post-008.jpg\" alt=\"William Morris's four-poster bed\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Morris's bed, with embroidery by Jane and May Morris.

Every Burne-Jones myth painting bears its own stark message, based on his bitter experience of growing up in Birmingham: the squalor caused by reckless industrial expansion, the absence of beauty in the vast majority of human lives.</p> <p>Morris too was mad on myths. While he was still at Oxford, he signed up for the Arthurian way of life, inspired by reading Southey's translation of Malory's <em>Le Morte d'Arthur</em>. He even commissioned his own Arthurian-style helmet from a local Oxford smith. Burne-Jones describes how Morris, always a cartoonable figure, got locked into it, hollering and swearing from inside. When Morris married, he built his own house, <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/redhouse/\" title=\"\">Red House at Bexleyheath</a> in Kent, as a red-brick Camelot, turreted and magical. You'll see in the exhibition the extraordinary <em>Prioress's Tale</em> wardrobe painted by Burne-Jones as a wedding present for Morris and his wife. This stood in their bedroom in the building which Rossetti described rightly as \"more a poem than a house\".</p> <p>Red House became a pre-Raphaelite powerhouse, headquarters of Morris's vociferous and marvellous \"campaign against the age\". Finding nothing in the shops that he could bear to live with, Morris brought in his brother artists to decorate Red House, working together to design and make furnishings in an early example of community arts. The style Morris espoused was the handmade, the vernacular. \"What business have we with art at all unless all can share it?\" he asked with his straightforward, almost childlike sense of fairness. The exhibition shows us some beautiful examples of Morris's designs for wallpapers and fabrics, which drew on natural motifs of birds and flowers and countryside, an aesthetic that appealed to people of all classes and indeed all cultures. He saw the point of pattern as a binder together of people of any nationality.</p> <p>What Morris loathed was waste and&#xa0;clutter, the cynical pretentiousness of 19th-century factory-made products. \"I have never been in any rich man's house,\" Morris said, \"which would not look the better for having a bonfire made outside it of nine-tenths of all that it held.\" A view that still holds good?</p> <p>Tate Britain has enlisted Mrs Morris as the exhibition's poster girl. How could it do otherwise, when Janey Morris, as depicted by Rossetti in <a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/the-collections/search-the-collection/display.php?EMUSESSID=0377d371bc4bd86c046f8295207617d5&amp;irn=163\" title=\"\"><em>Astarte Syriaca</em></a>, has come to personify the pre-Raphaelite femme fatale? The seductive gaze and bee-sting lips are in fact a bit misleading. The reality of Janey was more tentative, more practical. She liked a flirtation, certainly: after Rossetti came Wilfrid Scawen Blunt. But as a mother she was careful and responsible, as well as a skilled embroideress, a talent she passed on to her younger daughter, May. Morris, though hurt, was generously tolerant towards his wife's emotional excursions, believing that no one is another person's keeper. Janey and May together stitched the hangings for Morris's fantastical four-poster bed for Kelmscott Manor, another of the highlights of the exhibition.</p> <p>The pre-Raphaelite world saw a merging of the classes with a foretaste of the daring social flexibility we were later to experience in 1960s London. Janey Morris was an Oxford ostler's daughter. Ford Madox Brown's wife, Emma, had been the illiterate daughter of a farmer. Holman Hunt discovered his inamorata Annie Miller working as a barmaid in a pub in Chelsea and paid for her deportment and elocution lessons. Rossetti met the flamboyant Fanny Cornforth in the Strand, where she was chass\u00e9ing along cracking walnuts with her teeth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395471189\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346239739977/Mouse-by-Rosa-Brett-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mouse by Rosa Brett\" width=\"460\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Mouse</em> by Rosa Brett, c1860. Photograph: Private collection</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside the obvious excitements of sexual adventure lay chivalric attitudes of rescue and reform. The romantic image of the woman as co-worker was potent. Rossetti gave practical encouragement to Lizzie Siddal's serious ambitions as an artist. The ideal of the skilled woman in the workshop was to be a feature of arts and crafts communities from William Morris on. Recent feminist scholarship reveals how far the brotherhood was a hitherto-neglected pre-Raphaelite sisterhood as well.</p> <p>Among the many treats in the exhibition are paintings by Rosa Brett, elder sister of the better-known pre-Raphaelite landscape artist John Brett, and photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron, whose technical skills and poetic bravura in the composition of her pictures took her to the heights of pre-Raphaelite art. The exhibition gives us the rare chance to compare <a href=\"http://lizziesiddal.com/portal/elizabeth-siddal-and-tennyson/\" title=\"\">Lizzie Siddal's gawky, tender pen and ink drawing</a> <em>The Lady of Shalott</em> with <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/saxonadvent/hunt.html\" title=\"\">Holman Hunt's</a> much larger, higher-voltage, more hysterical oil painting of this favourite Victorian subject. This pre-Raphaelite masterpiece, lent by the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hertford, Connecticut, has not been seen in this country since it went on show in Bournemouth as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations in 1951.</p> <p>What makes this exhibition so important and so timely is the chance it gives us to see the hidden depths of a movement in which the artists' quasi-religious searching after new artistic standards was inextricably linked to contemporary intellectual debates and practical ideals of social reform. Look at Ford Madox Brown, represented here by his great panorama <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Brown_work.jpg/220px-Brown_work.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Madox_Brown&amp;h=155&amp;w=220&amp;sz=15&amp;tbnid=8zP8OQMRhB2JBM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=128&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dford%2Bmadox%2Bbrown%2Bwork%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=ford+madox+brown+work&amp;usg=__bY5jlloPvg-L5JS9FjDgxk2OSOM=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8_Q9UJDuL4bJ0QXyh4CgAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ9QEwBA&amp;dur=1284\" title=\"\"><em>Work</em></a>, which raises what were then stridently controversial issues on the relative value of the thinkers and the workers, the labouring classes and the employers. Brown was also the artist with the practical energy to open soup kitchens for the starving and a labour exchange for the unemployed in Manchester.</p> <p>Look again at gay pre-Raphaelite Simeon Solomon, the Jewish artist viewed by Burne-Jones as their \"rising genius\", whose promising career came to an end in 1873 when he was arrested in a public lavatory and charged with \"attempting to commit sodomy\". Tate Britain exhibits two of his works, a revealing self-portrait drawing and the beautiful androgynous oil painting <a href=\"http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1961P52\" title=\"\"><em>Bacchus</em></a>. At last we start to glimpse this lost pre-Raphaelite's potential significance as early undercover homosexual artist and interpreter of Jewish identity.</p> <p>But the absolute star of the show is Morris. A whole section, Earthly Paradise, charts what now seems his inevitable progression from the relative backwater of the artist-craftsman to the dangerous exposure of the political activist. As William Gaunt put it: \"His early attachment to King Arthur had led him irresistibly to Karl Marx.\" Here we see the ultimate example of pre-Raphaelite radicalism in action as Morris, in the 1880s, enters the mel\u00e9e of socialist revolutionary politics, finally exasperated by his role in \"ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich\".</p> <p>Here are Morris's \"<a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1894/chants.htm\" title=\"\">Chants for Socialists</a>\", rousing revolutionary choruses composed by the man who had once been the favourite poet of the bourgeoisie. Here is a fiercely argued, crudely printed pamphlet on \"<a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1890/monopoly.htm\" title=\"\">Monopoly; or How Labour is Robbed</a>\". And here is his widely influential novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fairytales/9780199539192/news-from-nowhere\" title=\"\"><em>News from Nowhere</em></a>, a vision of the future beyond the revolution, in which government buildings have been turned into a dung house and a classless, beautifully dressed and happily productive form of society has emerged. This was a book read avidly in Russia in the years before the Soviet revolution.</p> <p>All in all, this has been quite a year for William Morris. First the opening of the restored and redesigned <a href=\"http://www.wmgallery.org.uk/\" title=\"\">William Morris Gallery</a> in Walthamstow, the house where Morris spent his teenage years, and now his emergence as the noblest and most interesting of pre-Raphaelites. His ideas were precursors of our present-day concern for protecting the environment. He regarded beauty as everybody's birthright. His generous magnitude of vision, and his hatred of commercial greed and political chicanery, connects the pre-Raphaelite era to our own.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/extra/2012/aug/28/extra-pre-raphs-offer1\">Guardian Extra members are invited to a talk and private tour of the Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde exhibition at Tate Britain on 5 November.

  "<p>My copy of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/scienceandnature/9780199291144/the-selfish-gene\">The Selfish Gene</a> is the first paperback edition of 1978. Since at that time I was working on the Guardian's arts page, I suppose I bought it because it was one of those books everybody seemed to be talking about: a book that opened a new window on the world and framed the way we see life's great story. A few years later I heard a distinguished, elderly science historian rather brusquely describe it as a prime example of a metaphor out of control.</p> <p>That barb was not just misguided, but wildly unfair. Dawkins was always clever with metaphors, but his recurring imagery of a gene concerned only with its replication and survival is tightly controlled: in every chapter, we are reminded that it is a metaphor, an analogy, an \"as if\", a useful way of thinking about how behaviours, strategies and responses might have emerged from the mix of ever-renewing chromosomes and the disorderly experience of life.</p> <p>In the 30th anniversary edition, Dawkins all but apologises for the choice, offering other potential labels for the front cover. I'm glad he stuck with The Selfish Gene. To re-read it is to be reminded of what an extraordinary achievement it was. When he picked up the theme, researchers certainly knew that genes contained the instructions for protein assembly; some had found a way \u2013 laborious and inaccurate \u2013 to \"read\" a DNA sequence; and others had begun attempts to \"map\" certain genes to particular chromosomes.</p> <p>But that was about it: nobody knew for sure what a gene was, how many genes there might be, how they did what they did, or how they could affect the behaviour and preferences of an individual, or a species. The particular brilliance of the Dawkins approach is that he sidesteps such questions, and starts to work out how genes might survive to confer just enough advantage to allow their \"survival machines\" to pass those genes on to a new generation.</p> <p>That means that he can skip much of the modern technical terminology of genetics and use relatively simple language, which is just as well, because what he has to say is quite hard to understand. How could altruism have evolved? Why are sperm small and eggs large? How can predators and prey co-exist? Why does it \"pay\" to have so many, or so few, children? Does aggression always confer an advantage?</p> <p>An earlier generation of biologist-sages tended to report on ethological observations in limited populations, and from those infer something general about evolutionary pressures on social animals. This is the famous \"just-so\" story of evolution: the leopard's spots, the elephant's trunk. The Dawkins approach is very different. It doesn't matter much what life form you think of: a few sets of logical principles become enough to explain how, over time, biological behaviour must evolve to enhance the chances of that animal's survival: it did evolve, and an estimated 7bn separate surviving species are here to prove the point. And if the game plan had been any different, they wouldn't be here.</p> <p>Since individual life is short, and life on Earth is a 3.8bn year epic, what matters must be the information transmitted from generation to generation. So it's the genes that control the future: an animal is just the chromosomes' way of making another chromosome. Individual life becomes a punctuation point in the DNA's blind, automaton desire for eternity.</p> <p>Put like that, you can see why The Selfish Gene annoyed the hell out of assorted philosophers, biologists and bishops. There is a remorseless touch in the Dawkins style of argument, and though he occasionally seems to concede a point or soothe an anxiety, he doesn't really: he has already thought through all possible objections and is about to cheerfully demolish them with seemingly effortless logic. </p> <p>People used to call the Dawkins approach \"reductionist\", as if that were a synonym for heartless. In fact, there is a warm note to the story he has to tell and frequent generous acknowledgements to the researchers and thinkers whose ideas he addresses, and the excitement begins to build from the first chapters. The emergence of communication, of risk and reward strategies, of memory of the past and simulation of the future, can all be seen as logical engineering solutions achieved by trial and error: there doesn't actually have to be a \"gene for\" this or that precise behaviour.</p> <p>In the hurly-burly of life and death, altruism becomes not just desirable but inevitable, even in vampire bats; hawks and doves have no choice but to coexist; there become good reasons why populations always more or less seem to keep in step with resources; and male and female sexual behaviour naturally proceeds towards the spendthrift and cautious strategies we observe today. </p> <p>This is the book in which Dawkins introduces the theory of memes \u2013 the seemingly self-replicating pool of art and science, literature and music, knowledge, folklore and platitude that survives with each human life \u2013 and indeed coins the word itself, and fires the opening salvoes in what will become his all-out intellectual artillery assault on aspects of religion.</p> <p>The original book ends with the lovely conclusion: \"We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on Earth can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.\"</p> <p>The scholarly notes of the third edition, in which Dawkins deals with his critics and incorporates new evidence, are huge fun. One of the two additional chapters urges us all to stop reading any further and go out and buy his later book, The Extended Phenotype. I did so after first reading The Selfish Gene, but I ruefully admit that, at the time, it defeated me and I am not sure I will try again.</p> <p><em>Tim Radford's geographical reflection, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/scienceandnature/9780007255207/the-address-book-our-place-in-the-scheme-of-things\">The Address Book: Our Place in the Scheme of Things</a> (Fourth Estate) has been <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/awards/science-books/longlist/\" title=\"\">longlisted</a> for the Royal Society science book prize</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396268684\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347894767613/Cover-image-Written-in-St-012.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image: Written in Stone by Brian Switek\" width=\"140\" height=\"232\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover image: Written in Stone by Brian Switek</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Next month's book club choice is <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781848313422&amp;INTCMP=ILCBKSBTN3950\">Written in Stone: The Hidden Secrets of Fossils and the Story of Life on Earth</a> by Brian Switek, which Tim will review on Friday 12 October</em></p>",
  "<h2>What is the case about?</h2> <p>The case between Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich is the biggest private litigation battle in history. Berezovsky, the oligarch turned Kremlin critic, claims that Abramovich cheated him out of more than $5bn (\u00a33.2bn). Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, vehemently denies this.</p> <p>Their dispute arises from when both men made their fortunes in the murky Russia of the 1990s. Berezovsky says he was a partner with Abramovich in the Russian oil giant Sibneft. According to Berezovsky Abramovich later forced him to sell his interest in the company at a \"gross undervalue\", exploiting Berezovsky's falling-out in 2000 with Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Abramovich disputes this. He says he merely hired Berezovsky as a top-level Kremlin fixer and consultant because of his connections with Russia's then president Boris Yeltsin. In return for his political services, Abramovich says he funded Berezovsky's lavish lifestyle \u2013</p> <p>paying him \"more than $2.5bn\", and buying him yachts, planes and real estate in France.</p> <p>Berezovsky claims he was forced to sell his stake in Sibneft for $1.5bn when it was really worth at least $7bn. He now wants $5bn in damages from Abramovich, as well as \u00a3564m in compensation for another deal involving the Russian aluminium giant Rusal. Abramovich rejects Berezovsky's \"fantastic\" claims and says he doesn't owe him anything.</p> <h2>What did we learn?</h2> <p>The case has been heard in the commercial court in London's new Rolls building. It has been, arguably, the best free show in town. Both men were in court for much of the 12-week hearing, accompanied by bodyguards in dark shades, friends, PR consultants and blond Russian women. The two rival oligarchs also hired the best lawyers money could buy: Jonathan Sumption QC, now a UK supreme court justice, acted for Abramovich. Sumption's fee was rumoured to be over \u00a31m. Berezovsky's lead barrister is Laurence Rabinowitz QC.</p> <p>Both oligarchs faced hours of gruelling cross-examination, and accusations that they have lied about \u2013 or conveniently forgotten \u2013</p> <p>how they made their first billions. Berezovsky gave evidence in florid and sometimes ungrammatical English; Abramovich testified in Russian, with the court listening into a translation via headphones. Despite his Chelsea FC connection, Abramovich says he doesn't speak \"fluent English\".</p> <p>The legal drama also opened a tantalising window into the secretive world of Russia's super-rich. The court heard details of off-shore bank accounts, luxury cruises in the Caribbean (the pair first met in December 1994 on a yacht) and business deals done in five-star hotels.</p> <p>The biggest challenge for Berezovsky has been to demonstrate that he and Abramovich were indeed business partners; he admits their original deal was an \"oral agreement\" not made in writing but usual for the time.</p> <h2>What do they say about each other?</h2> <p>Both speak of how their friendship and collaboration in the 1990s ended in mutual disillusionment and accusations of betrayal. During the hearing neither acknowledged the other, with Abramovich sitting at one end of the courtroom with his entourage, and Berezovsky nearest the door. There was no handshake.</p> <p>In his witness statement, Berezovsky recalled how he originally had a \"very favourable view\" of Abramovich, then a \"small-scale oil trader\".</p> <p>He found him a \"very charming person\". Berezovsky attributed Abramovich's success in business not to \"intellectual capacity\" but to his knack of getting on with the rich and powerful: \"He [Abramovich]</p> <p>is good at getting people to like him, and good at psychology in that way. He is good at appearing to be humble.\"</p> <p>By 2000 the situation had changed, with Abramovich a formidable Kremlin insider in his own right, and Berezovsky on his way out and at odds with Putin. During the oligarchs' final meeting at Paris's Le Bourget airport, Berezovsky told his former friend bitterly: \"It's the last time I will meet you Roma.\" There was then no contact for seven years. Berezovsky served his writ on Abramovich after spotting him shopping in an Herm\u00e8s boutique in London.</p> <p>Abramovich, as you might expect, is now scathing about Berezovsky. He says he originally \"felt a strong emotional bond to him\" and \"previously always respected him\". Berezovsky, he said, \"did not regard me as an equal\". As time went on, however, Abramovich said that Berezovsky became increasingly \"detached from reality\", adding that there was \"something of a megalomaniac about him\".</p> <h2>What does \"<em>krysha</em>\" mean?</h2> <p>The Russian word of the trial. Literally, it means \"roof\". But it carries a kaleidoscope of other associations: an arrangement; lobbying; political services; icebreaking; physical protection from murder by Chechen terrorists and bandits; fixing; and a long-term relationship with more or less regular payments. Abramovich's case is that he hired Berezovsky to give him <em>krysha</em>. It was Berezovsky <em>krysha</em> with Boris Yeltsin that allowed Abramovich's Sibneft to win a rigged auction in 1995 for an oil company and refinery. It was this that catapulted both men from successful multi-millionaires into the billionaire league.</p> <p>The word <em>krysha</em> also features in the WikiLeaks documents released in 2010. In a cable describing corruption in Moscow, US diplomats note that Russia's FSB spy agency \u2013 former boss Vladimir Putin \u2013 offers the best <em>krysha</em> of all, extending its protective arm to Moscow's biggest mafia gang.</p> <h2>Why is the case taking place in London?</h2> <p>The international reputation of British justice as an impartial arbiter of business differences has encouraged scores of Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern businessmen to bring their disputes to company courts in London for resolution. In May, the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, spent a week in Russia urging local firms to use British arbitration and mediation services, promoting the \"UK as a centre of legal excellence\".</p> <p>Additionally, rich Russians don't trust their own legal system. It is famously susceptible to political influence \u2013 as the recent verdict against the Russian punk band Pussy Riot demonstrates. Plus, the Kremlin has pledged to arrest Berezovsky the second he sets foot on Russian soil. English law by contrast is predictable, independent and straightforward, with reasonable costs compared to New York, and a pool of willing City lawyers and experts.</p> <h2>How has the case gone down in Russia?</h2> <p>Russians have followed the case avidly. They have been enthralled by its exotic setting \u2013 London \u2013 and by the spectacular leaking of gossip from Boris Yeltsin's former court. Russians are familiar with the details of the 1990s, and the corrupt privatisation of Russia's once state-owned industries. But the case has offered an unprecedented insider insight into what really happened from those who were there, and a compelling oral history lesson.</p> <p>Russian journalists were in court throughout the trial, staying long after their English counterparts lost interest and drifted off. The liberal opposition title Novaya Gazeta likened the trial to Russia's version of WikiLeaks, and the country's leading newspapers \u2013</p> <p>Vedomosti, Kommersant, online portal Gazeta.ru \u2013 live-blogged each day. Kommersant illustrated its coverage with a cartoon, showing Berezovsky, Abramovich and the judge underneath Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament; Abramovich looks like a bearded geography teacher.</p>",

Jody Cundy takes to the velodrome in the C4 1k time trial (2pm), aiming to defend his 2008 title.

Jon-Allan Butterworth also races. In the pool, brothers Sam and Oliver Hynd go head-to-head in the S8 400m freestyle (heats 9.30am, final 5.30pm), Nathan Stephens takes time off from the javelin to throw the discus in the F57/58 competition (7.05pm) and \"Hurricane\" Hannah Cockroft races in the T34 100m (8.18pm).</p> <h2>Archery</h2> <p>10:00 Men's Individual Recurve -

  "<p>Social business was a term first coined by <a href=\"http://www.muhammadyunus.org/\" title=\"\">Muhammad Yunus</a> to describe cause-driven businesses whose success is measured by their social rather than financial impact. As a concept, it has been increasingly embraced by a range of socially driven organisations looking to establish their purpose.</p> <p>Social businesses differ from social enterprises in that they are genuinely self-sufficient and do not rely on grants and philanthropy to deliver social impact. Despite the rise of social business however, many still question whether an organisation can successfully deliver both financial and social returns.</p> <p>The social business of today has evolved from being solely based on the cause, to being profit driven as well. Such businesses are recognising that to be sustainable in today's world, they need to deliver effectively and efficiently. Having a social mission matters little to service users and customers if the end product does not meet their exacting standards.</p> <p>This philosophy is evident in many leading social sector organisations, including <a href=\"http://www.catch-22.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Catch22</a>, a 200-year-old national charity that supports young people and vulnerable adults in transforming their lives, and the <a href=\"http://www.leyf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">London Early Years Foundation</a> (LEYF), a London wide social enterprise that works to ensure that children have the best start in life.</p> <p>These businesses, though successful and leaders in their own field, continue to undergo transformation to ensure that quality services are underlined by sustainable and effective business structures. For LEYF, this has meant developing a sustainable business model that is no longer reliant upon grants and local authority subsidies.</p> <p>Catch22 has made clear their business credentials with the recent launch of a new corporate strategy and the realignment of services along business delivery lines.</p> <h2><strong>Motivations for adopting a social business model</strong></h2> <p>It is clear that these changes within both organisations have been motivated by several factors. Both acknowledge that it is no longer viable to rely on grants and government funding going forward.</p> <p>June O'Sullivan, chief executive of LEYF, states that \"charity is too finite a model for business with no sense of sustainability \u2026 due in part to limiting opportunities for new business and growth.\"</p> <p>O'Sullivan sees the transformation of LEYF into a social business as necessary if the nursery is to have a wider social impact and create a new way of providing childcare to society.</p> <p>O'Sullivan and Chris Wright, Catch22's chief executive, make clear that their organisations have always operated as businesses in their own right, regardless of legal structures, with an emphasis on both financial and social gains.</p> <p>Wright emphasises that managing a charity with a \u00a350m annual turnover and 1,200 employees requires, like any other business, requires sound investment, financial management and many tough decisions. By making clear to stakeholders its business credibility, Chris Wright hopes to attract new partnerships and investment to enable Catch22 to demonstrate that they can deliver services more effectively than current providers.</p> <p>Catch22 recently partnered with Serco in HMS Doncaster to deliver a payment by results contract aimed at reducing reoffending by 5%, which is just one example of the way in which they are seizing new opportunities to compete for business.</p> <p>LEYF has similarly been able to take advantage of opportunities available to them through their partnership and subsequent investment from <a href=\"http://www.socialbusinesstrust.org/\" title=\"\">The Social Business Trust</a>, as they look to maximise the social impact they are having across London.</p> <h2><strong>Challenges of transformation</strong></h2> <p>Transforming a long established charity into a social business doesn't come without its complexities however. One of these is the extra hurdles that social businesses sometimes face. For example, O'Sullivan suggests that it can be harder for social businesses to gain the support and finance they need to grow and develop, especially in the current economic environment. Wright also notes that there is some uncertainty about the reception that social businesses will receive from competitors and potential customers.</p> <p>Both Wright and O'Sullivan highlight mindset obstacles within the organisation and acknowledge the need for cultural change. Wright points out that many people choose to work in organisations like Catch22 because they want to \"do good\" and believe that doing good is incompatible with doing well financially. This mindset means that organisations undergoing business transformation need to invest significant resources to bring staff along the transformational journey.</p> <p>Another challenge facing social businesses as they look to grow is how to provide clear measurement and a narrative of their impact. This is an area that both LEYF and Catch22 have invested in.</p> <p>O'Sullivan feels that LEYF is now able to effectively demonstrate their social and economic impact. However, Wright notes that overall social businesses continue to find it difficult to measure and attribute impact due in part to the lack of a widely accepted way of doing it.</p> <p>Despite the challenges it is clear that, for many organisations, correctly managing the balance between financial and social returns, and shifting towards a social business, is paramount if these organisations are going to successfully operate in today's world. In the words of O'Sullivan: becoming a social business is not only essential but a duty if we are to have greater impact.</p> <p><em>David Bartram and Melanie Yap are 2012 </em><a href=\"http://www.onpurpose.uk.com/\" title=\"\"><em>On Purpose</em></a><em> Associates.

While we haven't seen it for ourselves, the 7-inch form factor of Archos's tablet also seems like a much more manageable size for a handheld gaming device than the 10.1-inch Wikipad, although the controls on the GamePad look like they're fixed, unlike those on the Wikipad, which are part of a removable gaming grip.</p> </blockquote> <p> Very hard to see how this can make any money if it's cheaper than the Nexus 7, unless it's got basically zero storage.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://advertising.twitter.com/2012/08/interest-targeting-broaden-your-reach.html\">Twitter Advertising: Interest targeting: Broaden your reach, reach the right audience &gt;&gt; Twitter</a></h2> <p>Twitter turns its attention to making money.

Under the agreement, Apple is now licensed to use some if not all of Motorola's standard-essential patents in Germany, though the parties have not yet agreed on a FRAND royalty rate, which will ultimately have to be set by German courts unless they agree on a rate prior to its judicial determination.</p> <p> This is a very significant development because it means that Motorola Mobility will have to rely on non-standard-essential patents in its efforts to gain leverage over Apple. It is enforcing one such patent (one that covers push email notifications). With standard-essential patents, it appears that the only thing Google (Motorola) can do now against Apple in Germany is to push for as high a royalty rate as possible, but even in a hypothetical worst-case scenario to Apple, the limit will be the 2.25% rate that Motorola has been demanding for a long time.</p> </blockquote> <p> Spotting that MMI has licensed the standards-essential patents requires a very careful reading of two different filings. Definitely correct, though. It would be useful to know how many of MMI's patents are FRAND, and how many non-FRAND.</p> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

  "<p>The 270 miners arrested during violent strikes in South Africa have been charged with the murder of their 34 colleagues who were shot dead by police.</p> <p>The murder charge \u2013 and associated charges for the attempted murder of 78 miners injured at the Marikana mine near Johannesburg \u2013 was brought by the national prosecuting authority under an obscure Roman-Dutch common law previously used by the apartheid government.</p> <p>The move came as the men appeared in court charged with public violence over the clashes at the Lonmin platinum mine on 16 August when striking miners armed with clubs, machetes and at least one gun allegedly charged police, who opened fire.</p> <p>Julius Malema, the former African National Congress Youth League leader, who has called for President Jacob Zuma to resign over the \"massacre\", told supporters of miners outside the courthouse that the charges were \"madness\".</p> <p>Malema, who was expelled from the ANC four months ago, said: \"The policemen who killed those people are not in custody, not even one of them. This is madness. The whole world saw the policemen kill those people.\"</p> <p>Frank Lesenyego, spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), said: \"It's the police who were shooting, but they were under attack by the protesters, who were armed, so today the 270 accused are charged with the murders [of those who were shot].\"</p> <p>More than 150 of the arrested miners have filed complaints that they have been beaten up in police cells by officers, according to the Independent Police Complaints Directorate.</p> <p>Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini said the complainants accused police of beating them with batons and fists and kicking and slapping them to force them to give the names of miners who hacked two police officers to death in a week of violence preceding the shootings. Eight other people were killed, including three miners and two mine security guards whom striking miners burned alive in their vehicle.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Pierre de Vos, Claude Leon Foundation chair in constitutional governance at the University of Cape Town, wrote on his blog that he could not imagine the NPA really believed that \"any court will find the miners guilty of murder for the killing of their comrades by the police\".</p> <p>He added: \"The NPA seems wrongly to conflate (either deliberately or out of shocking ignorance) allegations that the miners provoked the police, on the one hand, with allegations that the miners themselves incited the police to shoot at them because they had the intention to commit suicide by getting the police to kill them.\"</p> <p>Police commissioner general Riah Phiyega has faced criticism for saying that her officers \"did nothing wrong\" and acted in self-defence.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Less than one in 10 Lonmin miners turned up for work at the mine on Tuesday, the lowest level since workers returned to work following the clashes. Violence has since spread to Lonmin's other operations.</p> <p>The firm said 8% of its 28,000 workers showed up as union protests continued.</p> <p>Lonmin had initially threatened to sack striking workers.</p> <p>Malema said on Thursday that black South Africans are worse off than during apartheid and called for a campaign of nationalisation in South Africa including all iron, platinum and zinc resources.</p> <p>Staging his political comeback from a liquidated gold mine, Malema launched what he called a \"revolution in the mining sector\", according to the Independent.</p> <p>He told mineworkers not to trust the ANC government. \"Every mine had a politician inside,\" the 31-year-old said. He added that all miners should be paid a minimum of 12,500 rand (\u00a3930) a month, three times the current rate.</p>"
