  "<p>Crab cakes are an American classic \u2013 a dish born of plenty, and served simply, preferably with an ice-cold beer, on a deck overlooking Chesapeake Bay. Sure, they make them elsewhere \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/jul/03/foodanddrink.shopping2\">spiked with bird's eye chilli and lime juice in Thailand</a>; served with <a href=\"http://www.atelierdeschefs.co.uk/en/recipe/13853-causa-peruvian-chilli-and-potato-cake-with-crab.php\">cold mashed potato in Peru</a> - but nowhere are they more revered than on the east cost of the US, where they're honoured with festivals, cook-offs and, inevitably, <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-09-14/news/0909130097_1_crab-seafood-festival-cakes\">competitive eating events</a>.</p> <p>Crab cakes are a particular speciality of Maryland, as eager Wire-watchers will testify \u2013 McNulty even uses a box as a bribe in season one of the Baltimore-based drama. Interestingly, the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America suggests that the recipe dates back to the earliest European settlers, who, because of the labour-intensive nature of harvesting crab, would stretch the meagre results by using the meat in \"small fried cakes\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137103\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345559237405/Saveur-recipe-crab-cakes-002.jpg\" alt=\"Saveur recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such frugal offerings are unlikely to pass muster with today's Americans however \u2013 they rate their crab cakes on the quantity of crustacean. As Tom Douglas, the author of I Love Crab Cakes warns, \"beware the poor fellow who gets dinged for using 'too much filler,' a common reference to too many crumbs in your cake, for he shall hang his head in shame\".</p> <p>In Britain we may not enjoy the same abundance of seafood, but we do produce some great crab at this time of year, albeit of a rather more diminutive nature than they might be used to across the pond. Such a delicacy doesn't deserve to be buried in melted cheese, or overwhelmed with spices: the great thing about the American crab cake is that it really is more crab than cake. So, as our own season reaches its glut, it's time to crack open the claws and get crabbing.</p> <h2>The crab</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137104\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558975849/James-Beard-recipe-crab-c-002.jpg\" alt=\"James Beard recipe crab cake\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Beard recipe crab cake. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the UK, we don't see much of the blue crab, the American connoisseur's crustacean of choice \u2013 indeed, it's only been <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/cornwall/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8547000/8547289.stm\">sighted twice in British waters</a>. It is <a href=\"http://www.thefishsociety.co.uk/fish-detail_blue-crab-legs_10_200_0_1.html\">available online</a>, but it seemed to make more sense to use a native variety. However, the fresh picked crab I deploy first is mostly shredded too finely to work well in a fish cake of the American sort, which always call for \"jumbo lump crab\" in pieces apparently the size of a gobstopper. This just falls apart in the pan. </p> <p>If you can't find white crab meat in the necessary lumps, you'll have to do the picking yourself: get the biggest beast you can find, and work delicately, concentrating your efforts on claw meat \u2013 there's a <a href=\"http://www.shellfish.org.uk/files/3143SAGB%20crab%20recipe%20book%20final%20LowRes.pdf\">good guide here (pdf)</a>. If you're unable to find fresh crab, I have also experimented with (imported, sadly) tinned lump crab meat which, although the flavour is inevitably not so good, makes a pretty passable cake. </p> <h2>Playing a binder</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137105\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558471055/Old-Bay-recipe-crab-cake-002.jpg\" alt=\"Old Bay recipe crab cake\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old Bay recipe crab cake. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we've established, a properly proud American crab cake relies on there being as little of this as possible. The majority of recipes seem to fall into two distinct camps. The first, like the legendary food writer James Beard, chef and sustainable seafood champion Rick Moonen, Saveur magazine, and the Old Bay seasoning company, who have featured a crab cake recipe on their packaging for as long as anyone can remember, opt for something wheat based \u2013 breadcrumbs, in most cases, but there's also the option of crushed crackers, as in Saveur's, collected from <a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Maryland-Crab-Cakes\">Nick's Inner Harbor Seafood in Baltimore</a>, or flour, as in <a href=\"http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/recipe-of-the-day-crabby-crab-cakes/\">Mark Bittman's cakes for the New York Times</a>. I find James Beard's breadcrumb-based recipe, moistened with egg and a little cream, has the best texture of the lot \u2013 the crumbs give a lighter cake than the flour or crackers, which seem to give a slightly soggy effect.</p> <p>The second group, which includes a recipe from swanky New York grocers Dean &amp; Deluca's cookbook, relies only on liquid binders \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/Recipes/Crab-Appetizers-828/Perfect-Crab-Cakes-1020.aspx\">mayonnaise and sour cream in their case</a>. I find them rather wet in texture, and the flavour of the mayonnaise too assertive \u2013 the great benefit of bread and flour is that they blend into the background.</p> <p>Some recipes hedge their bets: the <a href=\"http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodlobster.html#crabcakes\">Baltimore crab-flake cakes</a> from 1932's National Cookbook start off with a bechamel, and Rick Moonen makes a sort of cooked mayonnaise base with hot oil and egg yolk, and allows this to cool before stirring in the crab and breadcrumbs. The bechamel isn't quite stiff enough to hold the cakes together well, and Rick's cakes, although fine texturally, are a bit too rich for my taste. The predominant flavour should be that of crab, rather than fat, so I'm sticking with Beard's breadcrumbs, and cutting out his double cream: an egg will do the trick just as well.</p> <h2>Flavourings</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137106\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558814422/Mark-Bittman-recipe-crab--002.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Bittman recipe crab cake\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Bittman recipe crab cake. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mustard is a very popular choice in crabcakes \u2013 the only recipe I find which doesn't include it is the oldest, which adds Worcestershire sauce instead. Wholegrain, as in the Dean &amp; Deluca recipe, looks pretty as it studs the cakes with seeds, but I think dry powder, as used by James Beard, is better than this or the Dijon in Rick Moonen and Mark Bittman's recipes \u2013 it adds heat without the vinegary tanginess of prepared mustard.</p> <p>I can't taste the yellow mustard in the <a href=\"http://www.oldbay.com/Recipes/Crab/Main-Course/Classic-OLD-BAY-Crab-Cakes.aspx\">Old Bay recipe</a>, in fact, all I can taste is this secret blend of herbs and spices, which was developed in Baltimore in the 1940s as a seasoning for the region's abundant seafood. Its packaging will admit only to celery salt, red and black pepper, and paprika, but I can also pick up nutmeg which, although I find the seasoning itself too pungent, works beautifully with the crab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137107\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558642059/National-Cookbook-recipe--002.jpg\" alt=\"National Cookbook recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">National Cookbook recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I reject both mayonnaise and Worcestershire sauce, which appear in a number of recipes including the Saveur magazine offering and the National Cookbook on the same grounds \u2013 too strident. Herbs are a nice addition however: Beard uses parsley, Old Bay \"parsley flakes\", which I assume means the dried variety, and Rick Moonen parsley, dill and chives. Like the onion he and Beard also add, I find the flavour of the chives too domineering, and I can't pick up the dill, but the pepperiness of the parsley is a nice complement to the seafood, and the white pepper in Beard's seasoning.</p> <p>Rick Moonen admits his recipe is \"a lot longer and more complicated than most of the others\" but insists that he \"made his name on these crab cakes, and they are worth every moment of effort\". The ingredients list is about three times the size of the rest, and includes sauteed red and green pepper along with the onion, fish sauce, Tabasco and lime juice. He's right: the cakes are utterly delicious, but they're not the classic dish I'm after here. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=39555261462\">Moonen's are well worth a try</a> if you're sick of simple, but I'll be sticking with mustard powder, fresh parsley, and a little nutmeg and paprika.</p> <h2>Coating and crunch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137108\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558061653/Dean--Deluca-recipe-crab--002.jpg\" alt=\"Dean & Deluca recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean & Deluca recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some recipes, like the Dean &amp; Deluca and the Old Bay crabcakes, simply leave them uncoated, but this seems a shame \u2013 a good crunchy crust provides a pleasing contrast to the soft crab meat inside. The National Cookbook and Rick Moonen use breadcrumbs (the latter my favourite panko variety), but again, this strays too close to fishcake territory for my liking. Beard's simple dredging of flour is less obtrusive, and works just as well in this case.</p> <h2>Cooking method</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137109\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345559132757/Rick-Moonen-recipe-crab-c-004.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Moonen recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Moonen recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most crab cakes are, of course, fried. Many restaurants also offer them grilled these days, however, to cater for the more health-conscious diner, an option given on the Old Bay tin, and the Dean &amp; Deluca recipe bakes and then grills them. The grilled, and baked and grilled versions, while nice enough flavourwise, lack the crisp crust of the fried variety, but shallow frying in \u00bc inch oil, as suggested by the Saveur magazine recipe, seems unnecessary. </p> <p>Although I find recipes calling for cooking in both butter and lard, and Mark Bittman goes for a mixture of butter and extra virgin olive oil, flavourless vegetable oil seems the best choice for keeping it simple. </p> <p>Rick Moonen browns his on the outside, and then cooks them through in the oven, but he works in a restaurant where the ovens are presumably on already. Heating mine up for five minutes seems wasteful when I could just make the crabcakes thinner, and cook them through in the pan. After all, this is a dish you don't want to be waiting around for.</p> <h2>Perfect crab cakes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137110\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345555811732/Felicitys-perfect-crab-ca-008.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity's perfect crab cakes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity's perfect crab cakes.

Do you prefer your crab straight from the shell, or are there other recipes which showcase its nippy charms better?</p>",
  "<p>It's a recurring social policy theme of the Blair and Brown years: for all the ambition and effort aimed at arresting toxic or antisocial habits, the poor and \"hard to reach\" remained stubbornly elusive, seemingly impervious to the government's attempts to persuade them to conform to healthier lifestyles.</p> <p>Thursday's research into health inequalities by respected NHS thinktank the King's Fund lays bare the full extent of that frustration. Middle-class, educated people heeded all the health warnings and campaigns of the Blair era; the poorest and least educated did not.</p> <p>It was not for want of trying. Rescuing us from heart disease, lung cancer, and obesity were early and passionate Labour priorities. That a working class man in the East End of Glasgow might typically live to the age of 60 while his middle-class contemporary in west London might live to 81 was an oft-cited scandal that, we were promised, would be addressed. A life expectancy target was duly set, but not reached.</p> <p>An energetic procession of public health activism marked the Blair years. Health Action Zones, Health Improvement Programmes, Healthy Living Centres. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_ban_in_England\" title=\"\">Smoking in public places</a> was banned. We were implored to eat<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/LiveWell/5ADAY/Pages/5ADAYhome.aspx\" title=\"\"> five pieces of fruit and veg a day</a>. Turkey Twizzlers were dumped from school menus in a Jamie Oliver-inspired makeover. We were bombarded with investment, legislation and exhortation.</p> <p>Some of this worked. A series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/16/advertising.uknews\" title=\"\">shocking and gritty TV ads</a> designed to emphasise the repulsive nature of smoking were said to have increased the number of people trying to give up cigarettes. A Food Standards Agency consumer education campaign resulted in average daily salt intake dropping between 2006 and 2011, inspiring nutrition expert <a href=\"http://www.fabresearch.org/1105/\" title=\"\">Professor Jack Winkler</a> to call it, perhaps hyperbolically, \"the most successful nutrition policy in the UK, and probably the world, since the second world war\".</p> <p>There was public and media grumbling about the smoking ban, introduced in 2007, but that too has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/29/smoking-ban-health-benefits\" title=\"\">judged a success</a>: since the ban, heart and asthma attacks have reduced, and more people have cut down on smoking (although there is less evidence that it has encouraged people to give up).</p> <p>In many ways, says the King's Fund, the overall impact of this hectic programme was \"a remarkable public health success story that has been lying hidden and unremarked upon\". The numbers of people who pursued \"multiple lifestyle risks\" (meaning at least three of the following behaviours: boozing, smoking, eating junk, not exercising) declined significantly over the period. Many of the professional classes were indeed persuaded to \"downshift\" their multiple bad habits.</p> <p>But not, it seems, the poor. Statistically speaking, for the unskilled and uneducated, the blueberries and jogging years have been an irrelevance. By 2008 (when the research data stops) the lowest income groups were more than three times more likely to exhibit all four types of high-risk behaviour, a significant increase on 2003. By the time Blair stood down, people without qualifications were more than five times as likely as those with degrees to be indulging in the full set of bad habits.</p> <p>This is perhaps the most frustrating part for Labour: that for all its wider achievements in public health, the risks to the health of its core communities were not arrested \u2013 and as a result, health inequalities widened.</p> <p>Blairite public health policy started with a materialist approach (\"social exclusion is public health policy in disguise\"), believing that state intervention and economic opportunity in the boom years would lift up the worst off. By the end, Blair had become disillusioned: perhaps it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jul/26/health.politics\" title=\"\">all about personal choice and the state had no role after all</a>, he mused. \"Our public health problems are not, strictly speaking, public health questions at all. They are questions of individual lifestyle.\"</p> <p>In many ways the coalition has continued this thinking. The central state's role has been semi-retired. Labour's targets have been ditched, and responsibility for tackling unhealthy lifestyles given to local authorities, who will come up with their own initiatives \u2013 although in a rare fit of centralist intervention, the government has also signalled it will introduce a minimum price for alcohol in England.</p> <p>Just as it has decided to focus Sure Start resources on the worst off, abandoning the universal aspirations of Labour, so the coalition has promised to focus public health efforts on the poorest and most unhealthy. Its approach, it says, should be judged on whether it manages to succeed in \"improving the health of the poorest, fastest\".</p> <p>The King's Fund says if it is to achieve its aims, the government needs to be smarter at working out how to engage with the very poorest, better at understanding why they drink, smoke and eat fatty food, and more perceptive about what might persuade them to change their lifestyles. It proposes a payment-by-results style approach to persuading local authorities to focus on the hardest to reach, backed up with the deployment of a network of \"lay\" health trainers (originally a Blair initiative) to provide advice and support to the incorrigibly unfit.</p> <p>Many who work in public health will remain sceptical. The hard-won successes of the Blair years were bankrolled by economic boom. As Britain suffers austerity, unemployment, debt, and rising inequality, so lifestyles will take a battering. The food banks and school breakfast clubs of Breadline Britain tell us the job of making the poor healthier is about to get a whole lot harder.</p>",
  "<p>Treasury plans to hand the Bank of England extra powers to oversee the banking system will give unelected officials too much power, one of the central bank's longest-serving former advisers has warned.</p> <p>Kate Barker said on Wednesday that the steady erosion of democratic control over regulation of the financial system would accelerate under proposals by the coalition government to create a super-watchdog in Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>She said oversight should be the job of the Treasury, based on advice from the Bank of England and other bodies involved in banking regulation.</p> <p>Echoing fears among many MPs that Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King and his successors will control an unwieldy empire of regulatory committees that could challenge the Treasury's democratic mandate, Barker criticised government plans to create a financial policy committee (FPC) alongside the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates.</p> <p>\"More policy decisions should be left in the hands of the chancellor, rather than unelected officials at the Bank of England. Mervyn King's successor will be appointed to an unduly powerful role for an unprecedented eight-year term,\" she said.</p> <p>The FPC differs from the work previously carried out at the Financial Services Authority because it aims to \"assess and steer the financial system as a whole, rather than focusing on individual organisations, which will now become the responsibility of the Prudential Regulatory Authority\", she says. For example, FPC members will have the power to restrict mortgage lending if there are concerns about a possible credit bubble, as there was before the 2007 banking crisis.</p> <p>Barker criticises the Treasury for delegating unpopular decisions to the FPC that should be made by parliament.</p> <p>In a report for the thinktank CentreForum, which has strong links to the Liberal Democrats, the long-standing MPC member warns that the MPC's remit is also flawed, because it failed to spot the looming banking crisis in the early part of the last decade. She says the MPC needs to take a broader view of the economy and have a more flexible inflation target of 1%-3%. At the moment, the central bank aims to limit inflation to 2% over a two-year cycle.</p> <p>Proposals to shift most City regulation to the Bank of England has also been criticised by the all-party Treasury select committee, which questioned the democratic processes inside the Bank of England in a report earlier this year.</p> <p>\"The coalition government has certainly sought to be radical in its approach to macroeconomic policy. But it has invented too many different bodies and not looked hard enough at what went wrong in the lead-up to the crisis. Most significantly, it has delegated too much to the Bank of England, which next year will for the first time have a governor appointed for an eight-year term, into a very powerful unelected role,\" Barker said.</p> <p>Barker's report pays tribute to the coalition for creating the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggesting it has increased the credibility of government tax and spending figures, but urges the chancellor to rethink deficit reduction if \"self-defeating\" austerity is to be avoided.</p> <p>Barker's criticism follows a call by outgoing MPC member Adam Posen for the Bank of England to take extra measures to ease credit conditions in the UK and encourage lending.</p> <p>Posen told the BBC Hardtalk programme that the double-dip recession was \"entirely predictable\" after the coalition accelerated the austerity measures adopted by the previous Labour administration. He repeated his condemnation of the Bank's governor for giving public support to the policy change at the time of the last election, though he praised him for reacting quickly to deteriorating economic conditions, especially after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US, which precipitated the banking crisis in 2008.</p> <p>Posen, who denied that the MPC's remit had created a barrier to bold action, has lobbied for an increase in the Bank's quantitative easing policy, which he said had been under-used in 2010 and 2011. He argued that an earlier expansion of QE, which involves creating money to encourage bank lending, alongside more direct efforts to promote lending to small and medium-sized businesses, would have increased consumer demand, investment and economic growth.</p> <p>In a sweeping criticism of the limited measures taken by the Bank, he said it should buy up mortgages and the debts of non-banking lenders to free the financial system from overwhelming debt burdens.</p> <p>Too often, the MPC had focused on persuading high street banks to lend more rather than considering setting up new banks with a mandate to lend, he warned.</p> <p>\"We should be buying things other than just gilts, such as bundles of private-sector debt and special bonds to finance infrastructure,\" Posen said.</p> <p>\"The funding for lending scheme set up by the Bank is a step in the right direction but I think the central bank should do more to go around the existing banking system.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 August 2012 because the original did not make clear that Kate Barker is a former rather than current member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, and the original headline described her as a \"Bank insider\".</em></p>",

He has already been disciplined for other professional failings, most recently in March 2011. The <a href=\"http://www.gmc-uk.org/\" title=\"\">General Medical Council (GMC)</a> had asked for an independent fitness-to-practice panel to strike him off the professional register for failings that included a botched postmortem, which led to a delayed murder investigation.</p> <p>The panel found Patel's 2002 reports on the death of Sally White \u2013 the first victim of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/26/ukcrime.rebeccaallison\" title=\"\">\"Camden ripper\" Anthony Hardy</a> \u2013 were \"irresponsible, not of the standard expected of a competent forensic pathologist and liable to bring the medical profession into disrepute\".</p> <p>Patel decided that White, a 31-year-old sex worker, had died of natural causes despite blood staining her clothing, bedding and a wall at Hardy's flat. Patel said she had died of a heart attack during consensual sex. This discouraged a police investigation that might have saved two of Hardy's later victims.</p> <p>In 2010, Patel was suspended from practising for three months after a panel found him guilty of misconduct or \"deficient professional performance\" in other cases. The National Police Improvement Agency, in October 2010, removed Patel from a register of pathologists who can be used in criminal investigations.</p> <p>The disciplinary process is now under the control of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, which though still part of the GMC is operationally separate from the regulator.

  "<p><strong> </strong>Ministers are considering a new wave of publicly funded housebuilding to kick-start the ailing construction industry and ease the shortage of homes.</p> <p>The housing minister, Grant Shapps, indicated his support for recommendations in a new government-commissioned report into the housing shortage which also proposes relaxing planning regulations that require developers to include social housing and allowing private investors to build on public land at no initial cost. The moves are designed to encourage a new round of construction, with taxpayers reaping the benefits when the homes are sold.</p> <p>The report, commissioned by the government from the chairman of the 3i investment group, Sir Adrian Montague, and published on Thursday, will be taken even more seriously because of the urgent need for a boost to the economy to create jobs and confidence in the private sector.</p> <p>Montague estimates that housing demand is increasing each year at double the rate at which homes are being built. \"Sir Adrian Montague's findings offer both a blueprint for achieving this goal [more housebuilding], and for setting the standards of accommodation that people should expect,\" said Shapps. \"I will be considering his recommendations very carefully.\"</p> <p>The suggestion that councils could relax affordable home requirements in planning deals for developers \u2013 to make projects more affordable when banks are reluctant to lend money \u2013 will be controversial because of the impact on people on low incomes.</p> <p>Labour said the report failed to address rocketing rents in existing homes. The shadow housing minister, Jack Dromey, said: \"As rents hit a record high in July, the government should be acting to address this problem, not looking for ways to water down existing legislation, which could make the problem worse.\"</p> <p>Mike Jones, chairman of the Local Government Association's environment and housing boards, said: \"Any strategy to boost the number of new rental homes should not come at the expense of new affordable housing, and councils will in consultation with their residents always seek to ensure a suitable balance between the need for private rental property and new affordable homes.\"</p> <p>Montague's report says the number of families renting has mushroomed from 2 million in the 1980s to 3.8 million. It says more families are staying in rented accommodation for longer before they can afford to buy property.</p> <p>He recommends that local authorities make fewer demands in return for planning permission and review conditions attached to developments that already have planning permission but have stalled over cost concerns. In return, councils could impose other conditions on owners, for example that new homes have to be available to rent for 10-21 years.</p> <p>The report says the government and local authorities could donate land or even funding to reduce the initial outlay, and so the risk, for developers, in return for a share of the profits when schemes are sold, usually to big institutions such as pension funds which want a steady return for investors.</p> <p>Montague also suggests a taskforce to co-ordinate the government's initiatives. More controversially, he rejects a \"kitemark\" for standards in rented homes but suggests a voluntary code of conduct for accommodation, energy efficiency, repairs and management.</p> <p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of the housing and homelessness charity Shelter, said: \"While we welcome the report's recognition of the need for more and better quality homes for people to rent, it misses a trick in offering nothing for the millions of people already in the sector, paying sky-high rents and living under constant threat of eviction or further rent rises.\"</p>",
  "<p>Schools across the country are reporting that students who sat GCSEs in English have been harshly marked down as the government's exams regulator, backed by the education secretary, Michael Gove, seeks to curb grade inflation.</p> <p>Headteachers representing dozens of schools in England told the Guardian that, in some cases, students had been marked down by an entire grade compared with the results that teachers had predicted.</p> <p>The results will be devastating for pupils who were expecting good grades and could trigger a loss of confidence in the exam system as students question their results when they receive them on Thursday.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told that 55 students at one school \"who were comfortably within the boundary of a C, some nearly at a B\" have now got D grades.</p> <p>The shock results follow reforms to the English exam and an order from the exam regulator, Ofqual, to end grade inflation.</p> <p>Many more schools are now likely to fall below the \"floor standard\" \u2013 a target set by the government stipulating that 40% of pupils must gain at least five good GCSE passes, including English and maths.</p> <p>Schools that fall below the target \u2013 raised from 35% last summer, when 107 failed \u2013 face being closed or taken out of local authority control and converted into academies, usually accompanied by a change of leadership.</p> <p>Headteachers receive exam results a day before students and can share them with staff. Wednesday's release triggered a flurry of concern, with schools comparing results with one another and headteachers' leaders being asked to intervene.</p> <p>Bill Watkin, operational director of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, said: \"It would appear that changes to grade boundaries have resulted in a discrepancy between predicted results and actual results in a number of schools. What I've been told is that the grade boundary change has resulted in a high number of children just below the boundary \u2026 heads are understandably focussing on the C/D boundary.\"</p> <p>Schools in Leeds and across London, Essex, Kent, Hampshire, Suffolk, Bedfordshire and Somerset have all reported problems with the English GCSE.</p> <p>The headteacher at the school where 55 children were marked down said: \"The effect upon students, who will have to be told that they did not achieve the Cs that they [would have been] so delighted to achieve, through hard work and application, will be devastating.\"</p> <p>Richard Thomas, executive director of the Association of Secondary Headteachers in Essex, said: \"I started getting concerns from schools about English results, not just in schools in challenging areas, but in some outstanding schools and schools with more comprehensive intakes \u2013 results way down on what they would have expected.\"</p> <p>Thomas blamed guidance from Ofqual to the exam boards, which, he said, had been required to adjust their grade boundaries.</p> <p>\"Schools are working on existing criteria and making predictions of student performance based on those expected grade boundaries. Large numbers of students are dropping at least a grade and there will be a lot of disappointed students, parents and teachers,\" he said.</p> <p>On the Times Educational Supplement's website, dozens of teachers left comments claiming their GCSE English results were down. One said: <a href=\"http://community.tes.co.uk/forums/t/597792.aspx?PageIndex=2\" title=\"\">\"Our results have been decimated. We're 10% lower than last year</a>. Like others, we've been hit by the double whammy of the exam and controlled assessments having raised grade boundaries \u2026 It does seem that our expected Cs became Ds and, because we're a school where most of our students are clustered around that C/D borderline, we've been hit hard. Members of my department are in a state of shock as they say they've never worked harder and this is the result \u2026 I'm very cross indeed!\"</p> <p>Another said: \"We're in a similar situation \u2013 vast majority of the cohort were C/D and would have got a C on a different exam series. I am so gutted, not looking forward to the consequences of this.\"</p> <p>New GCSEs in English, as well as new, separate papers in English language and literature, are being awarded for the first time this summer. Ofqual has put pressure on exam boards to ensure that the results are comparable to previous years. In its guidance, the regulator says that \"roughly the same proportion of students will obtain each grade as in the previous year\".</p> <p>There were claims that schools in disadvantaged areas, which have disproportional numbers of pupils clustered around the crucial C/D grade boundary, could be worst affected.</p> <p>The share of A-level entries getting the top grade fell for the first time in two decades in results published last week \u2013 26.6% of A-level grades issued this year were A or A*, a fall of 0.4% compared with last year.</p> <p>Since 2009, Ofqual, has adopted a new approach intended to contain grade inflation by comparing examiners' marking of candidates against the performance of that year group at previous exams, as well as previous years. The approach was introduced for the new AS-level specification first awarded in 2009, and the revised A-level first awarded in 2010.</p> <p>One exam board acknowledged that there was a problem brewing with this year's results.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"We understand that some students may have received results they have not anticipated and that this can be unsettling. We base our judgements on the quality of work we see in front of us, and we also draw on other data points, as stipulated by the regulatory framework, to ensure that the demands placed on students in each year to gain particular grades are consistent.</p> <p>\"Grade boundaries are therefore subject to change as we gain more information about the whole cohort performance, especially in a new specification.\"</p> <p>Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that there was \"massive concern\" about the issue amongst his members.</p>",
  "<p>David Brindle (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/20/paralympics-disabled-people-spending-cuts\" title=\"\">Disability movement at a crossroads as Paralympics arrives</a>, 21 August) underestimates the scale of the coalition's attacks on benefits and services for disabled people, and the damage they are causing to the lives of millions of people.</p> <p>The work capability assessment, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/23/gps-work-capability-assessment-scrapped?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">described by the British Medical Association as \"not fit for purpose\"</a>, was designed with the express purpose of removing thousands of people's entitlement to benefit. Reports suggest that many found fit for work after the assessments have subsequently died.</p> <p>These tests are being administered by Atos, a company whose handling of the assessments has been much criticised. It is a disgrace that such a company is sponsoring the Paralympics.</p> <p>The government, however, has responded to the controversy by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/02/atos-disability-benefit-tests?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> awarding a further \u00a3400m to Atos</a> to ensure that the number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jan/18/disability-living-allowance-data\" title=\"\">disability living allowance (DLA) claimants is reduced by 20%</a> \u2013 even though its fraud rate, at 0.5%, is the lowest for any state benefit. Many low-paid workers who qualify for DLA, and who rely on it to survive, will be forced out of work.</p> <p>It is not true that there are no disabled activists these days. We in <a href=\"http://www.dpac.uk.net/\" title=\"\">Disabled People Against Cuts </a>are committed to direct action to stop the criminalising of disabled people as \"cheats\" and \"scroungers\" by the press and government alike. DPAC, and organisations such as Black Triangle, are grassroots organisations of disabled people formed to resist and reverse these attacks.</p> <p>This new disability movement sees itself as part of a wider struggle to resist austerity. We have therefore from the outset sought to unite with the many other non-disabled people organising against the cuts. <br><strong>Ellen Clifford, Rob Murthwaite, Andy Green, Roger Lewis</strong><br><em>National steering committee, Disabled People Against Cut</em>s</p> <p>\u2022\u2008I was one of those disabled leaders instrumental in ensuring people with learning difficulties were included in disability antidiscrimination legislation and had the right to direct payments to support independent living in the mid-90s. Twenty years on, disability discrimination has become much more subtle. Could there be a correlation between the lack of disabled people in work and participating on mainstream professional courses, and the increasing use of psychometric testing based on non- disabled people's norms and experiences? Such tests are used by all sorts of agencies to distribute scarce resources, jobs, housing, benefits and alike. <br><strong>Simone Aspis </strong><br><em>Changing Perspectives</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Arguably the disability movement began in the 1960s, not the 70s, with the establishment of the Disablement Income Group (DIG). Led by the redoubtable Megan du Boisson, it rapidly became a thorn in the side of the then ministry of social security (as an official I was on the receiving end). The pressure exerted by the DIG certainly bore fruit in the 1970s, as benefits for disabled people began to be reformed.<br><strong>Robin Wendt</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008David Brindles' account reminded me of the scepticism facing the group that set up Peterborough Shopmobility 30 years ago. Although the new town development corporation was prepared to spend public money in supporting an innovation aimed at improving access for people with mobility problems, there was so little faith that it would be used that the office and store was tucked away on the 11th floor of a multistorey car park, where a discreet veil could be drawn around it when it failed. Now, with more than 350 such services operating in towns and cities across the UK, there is still no room for complacency because, although the idea is proven, the money doesn't flow as easily as in those early days and some schemes have closed due to financial difficulties.<br><strong>Les Bright</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008If, as Frances Hasler is quoted as saying, public transport is the acid test, she might not have taken great pleasure from seeing a wheelchair user abandoned at a bus stop in Hendon Lane, Finchley, a couple of weeks ago. The driver of the 143 bus was apologetic but two large buggies had taken up all the available space. Is it not time for the fold-up pushchair to make a comeback?<br><strong>Anne Hutton</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008We are looking forward to the Paralympics next week, but no mention has been made of this week's <a href=\"http://london2012.medway.gov.uk/majorsportingevents/britishtransplantgames2012.aspx\" title=\"\">British Transplant Games in Medway (23-26 August)</a>, which help to keep people fit who have had to have some kind of organ transplant.</p> <p>Last year's games in Belfast were a huge success and increased the number of donors joining the register, and if enough people did join the register there could be an end to the waiting&#xa0;lists. <br><strong>Judith and Treve Eddy</strong><br><em>Harlech, Gwynedd</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Philippa Perry's suggestion that \"special needs children\" should not be taught French, mathematics or geography (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/must-not-ignore-disabled-people-learn\" title=\"\">The person we'd like to be</a>, 21 August) made my heart sink. Disabled children continue to suffer from the tyranny of low expectations.</p> <p>My autistic nephew would like to go to a small \"special\" school, which would provide a good educational environment \u2013 but it does not teach geography, a subject in which he has a passionate interest. Thankfully, it does teach French \u2013 a subject in which he has a particular strength because his father is French. Of course, if mainstream schools catered to the full range of educational needs and diversity it would make it possible for all children to attend.</p> <p>As Ms Perry says, difference needs to be acknowledged. But this starts with listening to disabled people themselves, not trotting out third-hand stories about teachers who work with disabled people or relying on the fleeting experience of using a wheelchair while healing a broken leg. Could you allow disabled journalists, academics, psychoanalysts and pupils to speak for themselves?<br><strong>Caroline Gooding</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>There's no education in the second kick of a mule, as the former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn used to say. Even the Republican party knows that, as we can observe from its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-defiant-leaders-withdraw-support\">desperate efforts to oust Todd Akin</a> as its Senate candidate in Missouri.</p> <p>In an unprecedented display of party unity the GOP has been beseeching Akin to stand aside. It's a list that includes Rush Limbaugh, Tea Party super pacs, Ronald Reagan's cryogenically-preserved brain tissue (probably) and practically every Republican wandering past a microphone this week. When everyone from Mitt Romney to <a href=\"www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79976.html\">Sarah Palin is calling for you to go</a>, you'd have to think something was up, right?</p> <p>The GOP has learned its lesson from the 2010 midterm elections. Then the Republicans were riding a wave of electoral popularity but failed to win the big prize of control of the Senate. That was thanks to Christine O'Donnell, Sharron Angle and Ken Buck \u2013 a trio of overinflated Tea Party-backed candidates who won their party's nomination but in doing so destroyed the GOP's otherwise excellent chances of capturing seats in Delaware, Nevada and Colorado.</p> <p>Nobody in the GOP wants to repeat its 2010 mule-kicking, of weak, inexperienced Senate candidates botching millions of dollars in effort. And the stakes are even higher in 2012 since a toxic Senate candidate such as Akin can infect the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, as he threatens to do.</p> <p>But the potential 2012 damage isn't so much from Akin's views on abortion \u2013 since those are relatively mainstream within the Republican party's grassroots \u2013 as what he said about rape. And that's what Romney is desperate to distance himself from.</p> <p>Abortion of course remains a hugely <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147734/Americans-Split-Along-Pro-Choice-Pro-Life-Lines.aspx\">controversial and divisive issue</a>. Rape isn't, even if there is an antediluvian dispute about what constitutes rape. </p> <p>Let's briefly revisit what Akin said when asked about his total opposition to abortion, including those of a pregnancy resulting from rape: \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" Apart from an incredible level of biological ignorance, the phrase that terrifies Mitt Romney and the rest of the Republican party there is \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Romney already has great difficulties with women voters and inheriting a Taliban-like position on what constitutes rape isn't going to help him. Hence Romney's vice presidential running mate <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/ryan-pressed-to-explain-position-on-rape-and-abortion/\">Paul Ryan responding to a question on the term \"forcible rape\"</a> used in an anti-abortion bill he endorsed: \"Rape is rape. Rape is rape, period. End of story.\" Asked again to explain the term, Ryan replied: \"Rape is rape and there's no splitting hairs over rape.\"</p> <p>This is a neat trick for the Romney campaign to pull off. They can come out vehemently against Akin and his comments on the subject of rape, while glossing over any inconvenience of his views on abortion \u2013 and the fact that they are largely shared, in more politic terms, by many others in the GOP.</p> <p>But that point hasn't been grasped by some Democrats and some members of the media, who think they have caught up the Republicans in a trap of hypocrisy, pointing out that the Republican party platform to be adopted at the national convention in Tampa <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/08/21/718461/2012-republican-platform-to-advocate-abortion-ban-without-rape-exception/\">endorses a without-exception ban on abortion</a> and even calls for a constitutional amendment to end it entirely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Faithful to the 'self-evident' truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/paul-ryan-cosponsored-all-most-extreme-anti-abortion-bills\">Paul Ryan himself supports complete abortion bans</a>, and said today that he was \"proud\" of his <a href=\"firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/22/13416844-ryan-backed-more-than-one-forcible-rape-abortion-bill\">record on the subject</a>. It's a position in line with the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147941/Republicans-Unified-Democrats-Abortion.aspx\">mainstream of the Republican party base</a>, two-thirds of which describe themselves as \"pro-life\". Republican party activists are even more enthusiastic on the issue. That's not to say that pro-choice Republicans don't exist: the BBC's Newsnight found one to discuss Akin's remarks on Tuesday, which is like finding a dodo to talk about Charles Darwin \u2013 interesting but beside the point. </p> <p>Outside the GOP base, however, a solid <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/148880/Plenty-Common-Ground-Found-Abortion-Debate.aspx\">majority of voters support abortion being legal</a> for at least some reasons, rape and the health of the mother being the most frequently expressed ones. The Romney campaign has aligned itself with mainstream public opinion to avoid repelling independent voters on the subject \u2013 an uncomfortable pragmatic position that feeds the mistrust social conservatives already have of Romney. Which is why his campaign wants to limit the discussion about Akin to rape rather than abortion.</p> <p>As for Akin, we now have the <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/claire-mccaskill-s-political-strategy-paying-off/article_a745c5b6-9eaf-5ba0-9e32-8af5603bf86a.html\">comic prospect of his being attacked on all sides</a> by Republicans while being supported by Claire McCaskill, his Democratic opponent, who knows that if he stays in the race her slim chances of holding her seat are improved. The St Louis Post-Dispatch reports that McCaskill went so far as to say: \"I take him at his word that he realised what he said was wrong. I honestly do have sympathy for him.\" And <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071003151131.htm\">crocodiles cry when swallowing their prey</a>.</p> <p>That led to the utterly bizarre sight of Republicans attacking McCaskill for supporting <em>their</em> candidate. \"It should not be lost on anyone that some of the only voices not calling for Congressman Akin to do the right thing and step aside are Claire McCaskill and the leaders of the pro-abortion movement,\" fumed the Republican National Senatorial Committee in a statement that belongs in a parallel universe.</p> <p>Akin's calculation is that if he hangs on and the polls remain close in Missouri, then the rest of the GOP could be forced to come around and support him, because the prospect of winning a Senate seat is just too juicy for it to ignore. It didn't work for Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, but she was a crackpot with no political experience. Akin is a veteran congressman expressing a view on abortion that sits comfortably within the Republican mainstream.</p>",
  "<p>Even the most ruthless prime ministers affect dislike for cabinet reshuffles. \"I'm afraid the truth is that these events are always very bad and perhaps the worst of all the duties of a PM,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1986/dec/30/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Macmillan</a> confided in his diary in 1962 as he prepared to sack his chancellor in a reshuffle that has become infamous as the night of the long knives.</p> <p>\"I hated sacking ministers,\" Margaret&#xa0;Thatcher records in her memoirs. Tony Blair was the same. \"I hate reshuffles,\" he told Alastair Campbell in 1998. \"You just have to steel yourself, but they are horrible.\"</p> <p>Hate reshuffles though they may, modern prime ministers have managed to set their scruples to one side with drumbeat regularity. Macmillan, Thatcher and Blair all reckoned on an annual shuffle, normally at this time of year. The upshot has been a regular churn of ministers across Whitehall departments that would do credit to an exceptionally well-oiled revolving door.</p> <p>In one department, transport, there&#xa0;have been 34 secretaries of state (or equivalents) since the second world war, an average of one every two years. The Thatcher-Major governments got through 11 transport secretaries in 18 years. Gordon Brown managed three in&#xa0;three. Even David Cameron has had&#xa0;two in two years. Transport is not&#xa0;an exceptional case.</p> <p>By instinct, though, Cameron still gives the impression of not being a reshuffler. He came to power virtuously promising to try to leave ministers in place as much and as long as he could. The coalition provided an overwhelming new incentive to stick to that promise. Though Cameron retains the traditional prime ministerial power to reshuffle the cabinet, Nick Clegg possesses a formal consultative and nominating role in ministerial appointments. Reshuffles require both men to agree.</p> <p>Yet after two and a bit years at the helm of government, it would be surprising if Cameron's shuffling instincts were not now twitching uncontrollably, however virtuous his intentions may be. Though he has lost three cabinet ministers since 2010 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/29/david-laws-resignation-letter\" title=\"\">David Laws</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/14/liam-fox-resigns\" title=\"\">Liam&#xa0;Fox</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/03/chris-huhne-expected-resign-charges-speeding\" title=\"\">Chris Huhne</a> \u2013 the consequent changes have all been minimalist. In the junior ministerial ranks the continuity is, if anything, even more firmly established.</p> <p>But it isn't just prime ministerial meddling and a Commons majority that drive the temptation and the need to reshuffle. In any era, including this one, some ministers are not up to the job. Better candidates always deserve a chance to prove themselves. The iron law that says backbenchers will become fractious if their claims are persistently ignored has not been suspended. And the need to prove that a government is up to the task, and is not simply drifting and failing, never goes away.</p> <p>It is not hard to admire Cameron's wish to let ministers remain in place longer than has become the custom. And it is hard to see how any coalition could be stable without an appointments agreement like the one the Tories and the Lib Dems made in 2010. But that is precisely why the summer 2012 reshuffle, which is now expected within the next two weeks, is both really necessary and really important. The coalition, and Cameron, will have no better chance to redefine its public face before 2015.</p> <p>It is tempting to say that a government reshuffle is of fanatical interest to those involved in it (an understatement), of general interest to those who watch politics closely, and of absolutely no interest to anyone else at all, in other words, to the voters. In one sense, that is true. No one except those who are directly affected cares much who is in charge of most Whitehall departments, let alone about junior ministers. But it does not follow that a reshuffle does not&#xa0;matter more widely politically \u2013 because this one will.</p> <p>Read the Conservative press and blogs and you might suppose the only reshuffle issue is whether Cameron strengthens the Tory right in government \u2013 perhaps even preparing the way for a Boris Johnson coup before 2015. That is a midsummer fantasy which isn't going to happen. The reshuffle fate of the 2005 and 2010 intakes \u2013 more Cameronian than the right likes to admit \u2013 will matter more for the future. Remember, nevertheless, that in a parliamentary Tory party of 305 \u2013 a far cry from Blair's 418 Labour MPs in 1997 \u2013 the field of possible ministerial candidates is not enormous. In the words of Tristan Garel-Jones: \"Once you've eliminated the bad, mad, drunk and over the hill, you've got rid of a hundred.\"</p> <p>There are several ways that this reshuffle could send resonant secondary messages of great importance beyond the Tory party. Mishandle the Scotland portfolio and Cameron risks providing Alex Salmond's independence campaign, currently somewhat eclipsed, with a restorative dram. Promote Jeremy Hunt and simultaneously ditch Kenneth Clarke, and any remaining Cameron hold on liberal voters will be seriously weakened. Keep Andrew Lansley at health and Cameron hands the issue on a plate to Labour. Bring back Laws, and the Lib Dems have to decide who steps down to accommodate him.</p> <p>In the end, though, the only signal&#xa0;that matters widely is about economic strategy. The only job that counts with the public is the Treasury. This is not the worst government in our history. But it is one whose fortunes rest centrally on economic policy, whose poll ratings are bad and worsening, which this week lost the confidence of even the members of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/uk-public-finances-deficit-borrowing?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Institute of Directors</a>, and whose budget deficit is now increasing, not reducing. It is one that needs to change economic course. And this is a prime minister who has, effectively, only one shot at a significant reshuffle before 2015.</p> <p>The question that Cameron and Clegg cannot afford not to ask themselves is whether to move George Osborne. \"It will be personally terrible and I shrink from it,\" Macmillan wrote in his diary before sacking his chancellor in 1962. Half a century on, Cameron will be thinking the same thing, as other prime ministers have also done since. Most, like Blair, persuade themselves that things will all come right somehow. Sometimes they are right.</p> <p>Yet if Cameron thinks Labour can yet be stopped in 2015 then the case for Osborne to go is daring but strong. Change the policy. Change the chancellor. Put Ken Clarke or Vince Cable (or both) into the Treasury. Make Osborne party chairman. It might make all the difference in reviving confidence in the coalition. It is increasingly hard to see what else might do so.</p>",

Compass tries to follow the principle of being the change we wish to see in the world. This means that no matter the cause, the progressive left cannot deny, downplay or ridicule the seriousness of rape and sexual assault to treat women's bodies as collateral in some wider battle. Women's rights are not secondary to liberal or class politics, they are, and should be, placed at their heart.<br><strong>Ruth Lister</strong><em> Labour, House of Lords</em> <br><strong>Dr Purna Sen</strong> <em>LSE</em> <br><strong>Lee Chalmers</strong> <em>Leadership consultant</em> <br><strong>Rosie Rogers</strong> <em>National co-ordinator, Compass</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008George Galloway's attempts at clarification of his offensive video pronouncements on rape are both muddled and inept. He says \"nonconsensual sex is rape\". If a man has sex with a sleeping woman, he cannot have her consent. So on Galloway's own definition, that must be a rape. This is still more so when her consent to the original sex was allegedly subject to his using a condom, which this time he was not using. It would be interesting to know at which point, on Galloway's weird view of the law, the man's right of \"insertion\" during \"the sex game\" runs out.</p> <p>Galloway then asserts that \"Julian Assange \u2013 let's be clear \u2013 has always denied the allegations. And this has all the hallmarks of a setup. I don't believe, from what we know, that the director of public prosecutions would sanction a prosecution in Britain. What occurred is not rape as most people understand it. And it's important to note that the two women involved did not initially claim it.\"</p> <p>The fact that Assange denies the allegations does not mean that the allegations themselves, if proven, do not constitute a rape. It just means that he denies that he did what would otherwise constitute a rape. The fact that the women's account has changed does not mean that the present allegations do not constitute a rape. It just means that the present allegations are contradicted by earlier allegations, which may or may not be reason to doubt the veracity of the present allegations.</p> <p>Galloway's view of the DPP's view is as irrelevant as it is ill-informed. Most people would certainly believe that a man having unprotected sex with a sleeping woman when she has previously insisted upon the use of a condom is a rape, but their view is equally&#xa0;irrelevant. The frequent assertions that what happened would not constitute rape in the UK are simply wrong, but they are still being trotted out.</p> <p>Julian Assange may be innocent. I don't know. He may be being set up. I don't know that either. But these are matters for the Swedish legal process. He hasn't even been charged yet. What I do know is that a man protesting his innocence is not a complete defence to a crime. Still less is it a reason to assert that even if the allegations are proved, a crime never took place. <br><strong>Daphne Romney QC</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The suggestion in your editorial that the comments made by Todd Akin have anything in common with those made by George Galloway is frankly disgraceful. Akin wants to deny access to abortion even in cases of rape. This constitutes a grave attack on women's rights. Galloway was pointing out that the law requires a jury to believe that a person accused of rape might reasonably doubt that consent had been given if it is to convict and that \u2013 in the circumstances that he described \u2013 there was, in his view, no reason for such doubt. There is no attack on anyone's rights here. <br><strong>Simon McKeown</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>On a muggy July evening, hundreds of people are queueing to enter a shiny studio at the BBC's new MediaCity centre in Salford: we are all here to watch the filming of an episode of BBC1's new comedy, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/citizenkhan/\" title=\"\">Citizen Khan</a>. Created by and starring Adil Ray \u2013 more commonly known as a BBC radio and TV presenter \u2013 it also has the distinction of being the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/21/bbc1-commissions-first-asian-sitcom\" title=\"\">BBC's first Asian sitcom</a>. That's <em>ever</em>. But more on that later.</p> <p>Citizen Khan's comedy mostly takes place in the twin hubs of Mr Khan's life: the mosque and the family home in Sparkhill, Birmingham. The set is fantastically well-observed, from the clear plastic covering on the chintzy sofa \u2013 a familiar sight to many of us who grew up the children of immigrants \u2013 to the violently orange 70s-style kitchen counter tops. The next day, I meet Ray to talk about the show and its self-proclaimed \"community leader\" star. Mr Khan is an amalgamation of several people, says Ray, from \"intriguing\" relatives to the neighbours he watched and did impressions of&#xa0;while growing up in 1970s Birmingham. \"He's a Pakistani Muslim, and since 9/11, we've seen more and more characters come on TV and represent their communities, maybe not by their choosing,\" Ray says. \"Local news may well have put this person with the longest beard in front of a mosque and asked him a question about something happening 5,000 miles away. This person doesn't really have an answer to&#xa0;it but looks into the camera and goes: 'Oh, this is my time. Let me have my five minutes.' Maybe there's a bit of that to him.\" More than anything and like all of us, Ray says, Mr Khan just wants to be liked and admired.</p> <p>The character was one of several Ray created while presenting a late-night music and comedy show for the BBC Asian Network. He had a meeting with then BBC3 controller Danny Cohen, which indirectly led Ray to the door of BBC casting director Tracey Gillham. A year after their meeting he got an email: Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson were looking for people for their new show. It was Bellamy's People, a spin-off of their Radio4 spoof chatshow Down the Line. \"I did Mr Khan in front of Paul and Charlie in London and they loved it,\" he says.</p> <p>The pair gave him room to perform, he adds. \"It was all improv. They gave us topics and then we just went on location and got on with it.\" Mr Khan then went on to star in short clips for BBC Comedy, talking about topics such as the general election, cricket and Christmas.</p> <p>This has been quite a leap for someone with no real background in acting. Cheryl Taylor, former controller of comedy commissioning at the BBC, says Ray is unusual. \"He introduced himself to me, and I get quite a lot of people doing that,\" she says. \"Often, I&#xa0;think, 'Well, good luck \u2013 don't give up the day job,' because that's just the way it works. When I met Adil, I thought: 'Well, there's something about you.'\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395057057\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/22/1345652605506/Adil-Ray-010.jpg\" alt=\"Adil Ray\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adil Ray: formerly a presenter for the BBC Asian Network. Photograph: Jay Brooks/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Brooks/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The character was noticed by Mark Freeland, head of in-house comedy. \"Mark realised very quickly that [Mr Khan] was very much like the characters which are giving us our biggest laughs and biggest audiences at the moment,\" says Taylor. \"They're slightly larger than life, there's quite a lot of physical comedy involved, but they're very accessible.\"</p> <p>Initially, Ray was writing solo, in the style of a mock documentary, but when they decided to go for a sitcom format, two writers came on board: Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto, alumni of Goodness Gracious Me, The Kumars at No 42 and Armstrong and Miller. They worked on a script for the Salford Sitcom Showcase, a sort of X Factor for new shows. \"It's fair to say that Citizen Khan was the standout show in that it got commissioned as a series within 24 hours,\" says Taylor. \"Everyone had the sense that a star was being born \u2013 people started laughing even before Adil came on the set. It was really extraordinary.\" Less than a year later, they were recording in a studio. \"I think that's a record.\"</p> <p>Mr Khan doesn't look like too many lead sitcom characters I've seen, I say. \"Is it because he's brown,\" Ray asks me, before laughing loudly. Well, yes. It is the unspoken question: how, in 2012, is Citizen Khan the BBC's first British-Asian sitcom? Taylor maintains that comedy, regardless of who is in it, is hard to get right. \"We get far fewer sitcoms and long-form comedy scripts submitted by black and Asian writers,\" she says. \"And I think it's across the board in terms of sketch shows, and possibly radio. At the BBC, it's well-documented that we're very anxious to give the audiences as wide and diverse an experience as possible. But obviously, if it's a comedy, it has to be funny. The conversion rate is quite low. It's just one of those things.\"</p> <p>Ray agrees. \"Comedy is notoriously hard. I don't think commissioners can decide: 'Well, we need to have an Asian&#xa0;comedy, we need to go and find a&#xa0;black comedy.' That would be wrong and it wouldn't be very good. Things like Goodness Gracious Me, The Real McCoy and Desmond's \u2013 they were so good, so right for their time, how do you better that? You've got to find something else, other than it just being Asian or black. It's got to be strong and it's got to be character-led, and all in the right context and there's got to be a&#xa0;desire for it.\"</p> <p>Ray believes there is already a lot of programming in place for minority audiences. \"I've been working in radio for 17 years; I worked in Asian radio and television. But I think we have to be very aware of this: it's a population of 60 million, of which Asians are only two million,\" he says. \"I think sometimes we probably expect there to be more than there really should be. The majority of this country is still massively white. If you break it up proportionally, you might think, actually, we probably are about right.\" And minorities are not the only ones who yearn for something different. \"There's a certain sort of middle-class, Footlights white comedy, and it's only in recent years have we seen a return to&#xa0;more working-class comedy,\" he says. \"I think there's a whole group of&#xa0;people who perhaps aren't represented enough.\"</p> <p>The internet is changing that, although Ray cautions against getting caught in the hype machine of huge online hits. \"It's a very dangerous game. I think just because lots of people have seen something on YouTube, it doesn't necessarily translate into a fantastic TV show. In the end, it's still got to be a great character and it's got to be well written and well&#xa0;thought out and there's got to be&#xa0;a&#xa0;future to it.\"</p> <p>Citizen Khan's future already seems bright. \"I would love us to have a 10th series of Citizen Khan further down the line,\" says Taylor. \"I'd commission a second series today.\" For Ray, it's a dream come true. \"I'm so grateful,\" he says. \"Just at a time in my career when I thought I'd be presenting radio, I've had to learn something new with great people. My dream would be for Citizen Khan to run and run, for people to talk about it and reference it and connect with it. I want this family to be right in&#xa0;the hearts and minds of people of&#xa0;Britain.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/citizenkhan/\" title=\"\"><em>Citizen Khan</em></a><em> starts on BBC1 on Monday 27 August at 10.20pm.</em></p>",
  "<p>Tony Nicklinson, who wanted the courts to assure him that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/16/locked-in-syndrome-right-die\" title=\"\">a doctor who helped him die</a> would not face prosecution, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/22/tony-nicklinson-right-to-die-case\" title=\"\">has died</a> of natural causes only six days after his plea was rejected. His great fear of another 20 years or more trapped inside an unresponsive body was not realised. But he hadn't wanted to die immediately, only to have the reassurance that he could choose the moment when he did die, the moment when the indignity and discomfort of his locked-in state became too great. No one who saw his body wracked with sobs after the court turned him down could fail to sympathise with his plight \u2013 even if they, like the court, would reject his argument.</p> <p>Fifty years ago, when suicide was decriminalised, parliament was clear that helping someone to die must remain an offence. As medical advance has made living with severe disability more common, the courts have been repeatedly challenged to develop the law. The director of public prosecutions has now set out the factors that he would take into account when considering a prosecution of someone who assisted suicide. But beyond that, the courts, rightly, insist only parliament can change the law. And MPs are profoundly reluctant to tackle such a difficult issue. In 2005 \u2013 the same year that Tony Nicklinson was left paralysed and speechless by a stroke \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN04857\" title=\"\">Lord Joffe</a> tried and failed, as he did twice more. This spring a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120327/debtext/120327-0002.htm#12032752000001\" title=\"\">Commons backbench debate</a> was carefully restricted to considering only the DPP's criteria for prosecution. Parliamentarians are shirking one of their most fundamental responsibilities: to address the issues raised by changes in science and society.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN04857\" title=\"\">the debate</a> becomes simultaneously both polarised and confused. The courts have been asked to decide narrow and specific points: when, if ever, it is legitimate to assist suicide; why someone who assisted suicide might not be prosecuted while anyone who engaged in killing someone who could not kill themselves would always face prosecution. These cloud the larger debates, such as the morality of allowing someone to go to Switzerland to be helped to die but unable to access help here.</p> <p>It is not the job of the courts to consider ethical issues, to ask what message is sent to the disabled if considering extreme disability is a justification for suicide. They cannot address questions such as the protection of the frail, the quality of end-of-life care, and the fundamental issue of how life itself should be valued. These are the kind of important and difficult questions that may not have been considered by everyone in the large majority that supports the right to die. Ultimately, though, there is neither morality nor logic in acknowledging that an individual may kill themselves if they are able, but may not be helped to die if they are not. It is time to talk about dying.</p>",

  "<p>After 22 years battling against 76 counts of theft and false accounting, Britain's most notorious white-collar criminal, Asil Nadir, is on Thursday expected to be sentenced to spend most of the rest of his life behind bars.</p> <p>He has been convicted of stealing \u00a328.8m from the Polly Peck empire he built into one of the stock market's largest companies in the three years before its abrupt collapse in 1990.</p> <p>But the true scale of his fraudulent activities in the late 80s is thought to be much larger, with more than \u00a3380m secretly siphoned out of the FTSE 100 group, according to Serious Fraud Office investigators. The mountain of evidence against Nadir meant that prosecutors chose to bring evidence relating to just 13 \"sample\" theft charges before a jury during the seven-month trial at the Old Bailey, which finished on Wednesday.</p> <p>The twists and turns in the 71-year-old tycoon's story read like the chapters of a John Grisham thriller \u2013 lies, conspiracies, forgeries, controversial political donations, a ministerial resignation, as well as allegations of judicial corruption, SFO foul play and MI6 plots.</p> <p>But the most dramatic act in this protracted drama occurred on 4 May 1993, when, despite purportedly having surrendered all passports and his family posting a record bail surety of \u00a33.5m, Nadir asked Peter Dimond, a friend and pilot, to drive him to Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset and fly him to France.</p> <p>From there, Nadir travelled to Turkey and on to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus \u2013 a territory not recognised by the UK and therefore beyond the reach of the SFO. For the entire journey, he later told Turkish media, he had taken with him a gun, adding that he had been prepared to shoot anyone who tried to block his passage. It was to mark the beginning of a new lifestyle for Nadir, who, despite his great wealth and connections to the political elite of northern Cyprus, remained armed or accompanied by bodyguards throughout his 17 years on the island.</p> <p>Ensconced in his guarded mountain villa, Nadir made no effort to maintain a low profile, inviting British media to visit and regaling them with conspiracy theories about how dark forces within the British establishment had conspired to engineer his downfall by foul means. He could never receive a fair trial in Britain, he said. Reporters were shown around his palatial new home, each of them always introduced with a mischievous grin to his two parrots, Polly and Peck.</p> <p>In his early years in exile, Nadir was joined by figures alleged to have helped with the fraud and his flight from justice, including Dimond and his loyal lieutenant Elizabeth Forsyth, who had been involved in several money transfers. Both Forsyth and Dimond \u2013 eventually returned to the UK and separately found guilty for their roles in the scandal \u2013 had their respective convictions overturned on appeal.</p> <p>Another figure linked to Nadir, Michael Francis, who had a conviction for attempted murder, also found his way to northern Cyprus. He had been involved in concocting a false allegation of a conspiracy to bribe Nadir's trial judge, Justice Tucker, some months before the tycoon's flight from the UK. It was this outlandish claim \u2013 one that Francis later claimed had been made up at the behest of the SFO \u2013 that Nadir was to rely on as an explanation for his flight from justice.</p> <p>Ersin Tatar, a fellow Turkish Cypriot who had been Polly Peck's assistant treasurer, is now finance minister in northern Cyprus. He has never been charged with an offence but was named by the SFO during the trial among a list of Nadir's main helpers.</p> <p>For years, Nadir's escape was chalked up as another dismal failure by the bungling SFO. But suggestions that SFO prosecutors had let Nadir slip through their fingers were wide of the mark. In truth, the agency had bitterly opposed granting him bail, believing Nadir was a strong flight risk. Justice Tucker took a more relaxed view and Nadir was given his liberty.</p> <p>Whoever was to blame, the upshot was the same: for almost two decades it looked as though the former Polly Peck boss would see out his days basking in the sunshine of his Mediterranean hideaway, the one that got away.</p> <p>For reasons still unclear, however, that position changed abruptly two years ago when Nadir signalled in a British newspaper interview that he would be prepared to return to the UK and face justice so long as an undertaking was given not to oppose bail. The move triggered a flurry of excitement at Elm House, the SFO's London headquarters, as investigators rushed to the archives to dust down the Polly Peck files.</p> <p>In yet another bizarre twist, however, those reviewing these faded paperwork began falling ill and it quickly emerged that the documents had become contaminated with a toxic bacteria. All of the papers had to be laboriously photocopied by staff wearing protective clothing. Despite the Nadir case seeming in so many ways to be cursed, the then SFO director Richard Alderman took the brave decision to take up the challenge, agreeing to the terms on which Nadir said he would return.</p> <p>The formalities ironed out, within a few months Britain's best-known white-collar fugitive stepped of a plane at Luton airport in August 2010, accompanied by a pack of hand-picked media selected to join him for the flight. Assembled reporters were told, with customary bravado, that he had returned to battle an \"immense injustice and tremendous abuse of power\".</p> <p>\"It is inconceivable that I would steal from the company I built up \u2026 I have always said that I was innocent and that has given me the courage and the determination to come back.\"</p> <p>The impression of a man of means was maintained as Nadir, accompanied by his 28-year-old wife, Nur, was whisked away in a chauffeur-driven Jaguar with blacked-out windows to the Mayfair flat which has been his home ever since. Subject to a curfew, he was ordered to wear an electronic tag and report to a police station weekly.</p> <p>Before the trial began, Nadir, who had been granted legal aid to fund his defence, instructed his lawyers to apply for charges against him to be thrown out on multiple grounds, rehashing conspiracy theories worked up over decades on the veranda of his villa. He also claimed a weak heart had left him unfit to stand trial. Each of these tall stories were given short shrift by the court.</p> <p>For much of the 80s, Nadir was feted in the City of London as a shining example of a new generation of self-made Thatcherite businessman. At the start of the decade he had folded his Cyprus-based citrus fruit trading business into an ailing stock market-listed rag trade firm based in the East End of London called Polly Peck, in which he had taken a majority interest. There followed a string of deals that saw the group diversify further, branching out into electronics with the launch of Turkish electronics company Vestel, and later acquiring the Del Monte fruit business and taking a majority stake in Japanese firm Sansui Electric.</p> <p>Nadir became a cult figure, and every stockbroker in the Square Mile could rehearse the story: \u00a31,000 invested in Polly Peck in 1979 was worth \u00a31m 10 years later. At its peak, the group was valued at \u00a32.2bn. By the time the first cracks in the Polly Peck story began to surface, Nadir, who started in business as a schoolboy, selling newspapers and razor blades around the eastern Cypriot port of Famagusta, had built an army of fanatically loyal followers who rushed to his defence.</p> <p>A day after the SFO's first raid on the company, Polly Peck directors asked the stock exchange for trading in company shares to be suspended, adding: \"[We] wish to emphasise that the board deplores the recent attacks on its chairman.\" Forsyth also fought back against allegations, declaring : \"I think the SFO is responsible for the collapse in the Polly Peck share price \u2026 A \u00a31.5bn company was virtually wiped out in 24 hours.\" A month later, the company had imploded, owing debts of \u00a3550m.</p> <p>Perhaps the most enduring campaigner on behalf of Nadir was the then Conservative MP and Northern Ireland minister Michael Mates, who ran a high-profile campaign to highlight several procedural flaws in the SFO probe, even suggesting there might be MI6 involvement in the case. Mates insisted he had taken up the matter in the interests of justice and took no view on Nadir's guilt or innocence. Nevertheless, others noted that Nadir had been a major Tory donor, giving \u00a3440,000 to party coffers.</p> <p>Mates's position became even more difficult in the wake of Nadir's dramatic flight from justice, and he eventually chose to step down \u2013 but not before stunning his fellow MPs with a resignation speech savaging the SFO for alleged misconduct and deliberately trying to \"destabilise\" Nadir's defence.</p> <p>But Mates's campaign was undermined after it emerged he had borrowed a car from Nadir's PR adviser. A further hint at a warm relationship between the two came when it emerged Mates had given a watch to Nadir as a birthday present, bearing the inscription: \"Don't let the buggers get you down.\" Nadir later explained he had had an expensive watch removed from his wrist during a raid on his flat in Eaton Square, Belgravia, by his trustees in bankruptcy.</p> <p>During the lengthy Old Bailey trial, Mates was one of the few Nadir allies who gave evidence in his defence \u2013 although he was only able to testify in relation to peripheral issues in the case.</p> <p>At the heart of the Polly Peck fraud was a series of purported transfers to subsidiaries of Polly Peck in Turkey and Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, which the SFO's counsel, Philip Shears QC, said were disguised in order to mask the fact they were for the benefit of Nadir or his associates.</p> <p>In truth, the cash had been spirited away through a Nadir family trust in Jersey and on to Switzerland, where the money went was spent on secretly propping up Polly Peck's shares as well as bankrolling a lavish lifestyle for Nadir and his family. At trial it emerged that among the uses of stolen cash had been payments to race horse trainer Jenny Pitman, the purchase of Cypriot newspapers, a \u00a31m antique fireplace from Christie's, a Ferrari Testarossa and several Mayfair properties as well as his Leicestershire estate Baggrave Hall.</p> <p>Operations in Cyprus and Turkey, especially those of Polly Peck's carton packaging firm Unipac, came to be the main profit generators within the group \u2013 a fact that did not trouble directors or shareholders for many years. However, these were also divisions over which Nadir had almost total control, out of the prying eyes of his fellow directors. Unipac was run by Nadir's brother-in-law and was not audited by Polly Peck's accountants, Stoy Hayward.</p> <p>Nadir's fellow directors and the company's auditors were fooled into thinking money had been switched from London to subsidiaries in northern Cyprus and Turkey. Later, after serious concerns eventually surfaced, Nadir claimed that hundreds of millions of pounds flowing out of the London parent company had been matched by cash deposits put back into the group via a northern Cyprus subsidiary.</p> <p>Shears attacked these claims, suggesting they were based on lies and forgeries. He said Nadir's assertion that huge cash deposits were made by, or on behalf of, Nadir's elderly mother into an account at Industrial Bank of Kibris (IBK), a small bank privately owned by the former Polly Peck executive chairman, were implausible.</p> <p>One document purporting to be a bank slip appeared to detail a deposit of 148.8m Turkish lire denominated in 100 lire bank notes. \"Such a huge quantity of bank notes is likely to have weighed approximately 135,185kg \u2013 over 135 tonnes,\" said Shears. \"As for the space taken up by such a volume of bank notes \u2013 if all the notes were piled on top of each other they would reach something like 300 times the height of Nelson's column.\"</p> <p>Nadir spent last night in Belmarsh jail and will this morning learn how long he must serve behind bars. The SFO's director, David Green QC, last night paid tribute to the determination of his colleagues and predecessors, describing the complex prosecution relating to events up to 25 years ago as a remarkable achievement.</p>",
  "<p>In horror movies, the scariest moments usually come from the monster you can't see. So the same goes for real life, or at least online life. Over the past few years, largely out of sight, governments have been clawing back freedoms on the internet, turning an invention that was designed to emancipate the individual into a tool for surveillance and control. In the next few months, this process is set to be enshrined internationally, amid plans to put cyberspace under the authority of a largely secretive and obscure UN agency.</p> <p>If this succeeds, this will be an important boost to states' plans to censor the web and to use it to monitor citizens. Virtually all governments are at it. Some are much worse than others. The introduction <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/11/russia-internet-censorship?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">last month of a law in Russia creating a blacklist of websites </a>that contain \"extremist\" content was merely the latest example of an alarming trend. Authoritarian states have long seen cyberspace as the ultimate threat to their source of power.</p> <p>They are given succour by self-styled democracies who seek to introduce legislation enhancing the rights of authorities and security agencies to snoop. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/14/online-snooping-home-office-cost?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">British government's current draft communications bill</a> would produce a system of blanket collection and retention of all online data. As the group Privacy International pointed out in its submission to parliament: \"The technology that will be used is only currently deployed in Kazakhstan, China and Iran \u2026 subjecting citizens to the near certainty of ongoing and unremitting interference in their private lives.\"</p> <p>All governments, whatever their hue, cite similar threats: terrorism and organised crime, child pornography and intellectual property are the ones most commonly used. Unsurprisingly these, and local variants, are used by dictatorships, who need merely to point to precedents set in the west to counter any criticism with the charge of hypocrisy.</p> <p>The internet, as originally envisaged, was borderless. In theory, anyone could \u2013 if they had access to the bandwidth \u2013 find out information anywhere and communicate with anyone. The demarcation between free expression and data and identify privacy on the one hand, and the state's right to security on the other, is continually debated and recalibrated, partly due to technological advances.</p> <p>One of the most vigorous places for debate has been the<a href=\"http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/\" title=\"\"> Internet Governance Forum</a>, which since its founding in 2005 has brought together governments, private sector firms large and small, academics and members of civil society. This year's meeting in November takes place incongruously and intriguingly in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, a country with a particularly poor record on free expression and suppression of dissent.</p> <p>What matters, as the lines are drawn, is transparency and inclusivity. If the internet is to be governed more cohesively, and on a less ad hoc basis than now, then it should not be left to governments alone. There has never been a central authority, and the internet has flourished in spite of (or perhaps because of) its decentralised governance model.</p> <p>The reverse is now in prospect. In December in Dubai, a body that has existed for 150 years but few outside narrow industry circles have heard of, is seeking to take control of the internet. The<a href=\"http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"> International Telecommunications Union</a> (ITU), a UN organisation that counts 193 countries as its members, aims to add the internet to its existing regulatory roles. Its strongest supporters include regimes such as China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who submitted a proposal last September to the UN general assembly for an \"international code of conduct for information security\". Its goal is to establish government-led \"international norms and rules standardising the behaviour of countries concerning information and cyberspace\".</p> <p>These countries, and others of their ilk, have three main goals for the Dubai summit and beyond: an assertion of national sovereignty over cyber communication; a clampdown on anonymity and encryption; and a change in global governance. Not that many readers would know as much. Official preparations for the ITU are clouded in secrecy, as is the organisation's standard practice, but information has been coming out via <a href=\"http://wcitleaks.org/\" title=\"\">WCITleaks.org</a>, a website created by two techies to publish leaked documents for the meeting. The ITU describes itself as a \"multi-stakeholder\" organisation, but the claim is spurious. All the big decisions are taken in meetings in which only governments can take part.</p> <p>Lobbying (from all sides) has been taking place for months, but almost completely behind the scenes. Netizens have been shut out from this process.</p> <p>Other cultural and political messages are in play too. Some developing nations and emerging powers are galvanised by the prospect of prising jurisdiction away from the US. This is the most seductive part of their message. Since its inception, the internet has been dominated by the US, both government, corporations, civil society groups and users. This is changing fast. Access to high-speed internet via mobile will transform access to information in developing countries in coming years.</p> <p>The internationalisation of the internet is inevitable, and good. The question is not which countries are in charge, but where the power resides within countries. Control is always the first instinct of the state. The ITU summit in December marks just the start of the battle between those who wish to keep the internet (relatively) free and those who will do everything in their power to reverse the process.</p>",
  "<p>Greece's hopes of being granted more time to hit the targets imposed by its international creditors have received a setback when EU leaders refused to make a decision until next month.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/eurozone-crisis-greece-pm-samaras-cuts\" title=\"\">German chancellor Angela Merkel and Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker both warned</a> that Greece's future depended on the verdict of its troika of lenders, who will announce in September whether Athens is meeting the terms of its existing bailout programme.</p> <p>Juncker warned that Greece must cut spending and enforce meaningful structural reforms in return for ongoing aid.</p> <p>\"The ball is in the Greek court \u2013 in fact this is the last chance and Greek citizens have to know this,\" said Juncker, after discussing the crisis with Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras in Athens.</p> <p>Samaras had earlier ratcheted up the pressure on eurozone leaders by warning that the country was \"bleeding\".</p> <p>He used <a href=\"http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/antonis-samaras/griechenlands-premier-ueber-schulden-sparen-und-euroausstieg-25779000.bild.html\" title=\"\">an interview with Bild</a>, the German tabloid, to plead for Greece to be given two more years to bring its borrowings under control.</p> <p>\"We have to crank up growth because that decreases the financial gaps. All we want is a bit of 'air to breathe' to get the economy running and to increase state income,\" Samaras told Bild.</p> <p>Merkel, who will host Samaras in Berlin later this week, also refused to be bounced into a quick decision. \"We won't find solutions on Friday,\" she said during a trip to Moldova.</p> <p>Greek officials say that a two-year extension would not require a formal third bailout.

  "<p>Unlike Nelson Mandela, I left prison today in relative obscurity and without a parade \u2026 but then I was guilty of a murder. That is an inescapable fact, that my future is always resting on the fact that I killed another human being.</p> <p>So as I wend my way home, I am as reflective as I am excited. Being continually asked how I was feeling made such reflection inevitable. I don't know how I feel and I don't know how I should be feeling.</p> <p>It has been a strange life. Imprisoned at the age of 14, having pleaded guilty to killing a friend, I have accidentally become one of the longest serving juvenile prisoners \u2013 serving 32 years. Added to this is a small public profile due to my being, again accidentally, one of my generation's most vocal of critics of the prison system and its allied political machinations.</p> <p>I feel somewhat disconnected. Not disconnected in the sense that all prisoners are disconnected. My singular blog, singular in the sense of being the only regular British <a href=\"http://prisonerben.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">prison blogger</a>, has had to be maintained since 2009 at one degree removed by sending my thoughts in a letter to friends who put them online. But no; I mean disconnected in a rather less tangible way. After all, the prison system has been my enemy for all of my adult life, and his morning I awoke to the knowledge that this enemy would no longer be ever-present in my life. I now have to find a purpose in life beyond that of being a counterpoint to the carceral machine.</p> <p>In writing about my situation in prison, exploring the practicalities, policies and morality of my crime and the response to it, I took a deliberate (if naive) decision to insert myself into the public eye. My calculation was that my comments in the debate may carry a forcefulness or insight that may otherwise be lacking. Obviously, this left me open to equally public criticism.</p> <p>Criticism was to be expected. I can't commit the greatest of crimes and expect my existence, let alone opinions, to pass unchallenged. As ever, though, my greatest critics were those from within the prison system. Those in charge of controlling my daily life were extremely critical of my stance.</p> <p>My politics are old fashioned, in the stream of Hobbes, Locke and so on. There is nothing like being held by the throat by the state to make one ponder the ethics of government and the nature of the state. And so I have always, from my first days in prison 32 years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/14/prison-blogging-law\" title=\"\">challenged</a> the status quo for prisoners. Blogging is the latest manifestation of this urge to shed light upon the darkest corner of the abuses of power that inevitably come with secrecy and total control.</p> <p>The blog saw me subjected to petty retaliations by staff as well as stern lectures from governors. Almost to my last day, it was made clear to me that the blog was an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/oct/07/ben-gunn-blogging-prisoner-aop\" title=\"\">unwelcome spotlight</a> on the penal estate. It was even a brief topic of discussion at my parole hearing.</p> <p>This urge to resist abuses of power is the biggest reason for my being detained for 22 years over tariff (the minimum amount of time I had to serve). Violence and general reoffending have never been issues in my prison career; mindless compliance with inanity was my \"issue\". It continues to be a topic of concern. And yet those in charge of my life have never understood that my urge to resist abuses of power, the drive to do what I perceived as being the right thing in the face of overwhelming state power, is a flower that lives in the mud that is my crime.</p> <p>Killing another human being is the grossest abuse of power. What I did I have always perceived as being a step on the road that leads inevitably to Auschwitz. It is a part of the human heart that must always be watched, always challenged. And that is the adult I grew into. One effect of this is that I not only challenged my own attitudes and actions but those of my keepers. And while the former is welcomed, the latter most certainly was not. Many, many years of my life have been spent unnecessarily in prison for this stance.</p> <p>And now I find myself free. On my first afternoon in liberty I find myself writing this. The challenge is a perpetual one for me \u2013 while the state is no longer watching my every moment, it remains ever present in our lives, and government must always be watched with some suspicion.</p> <p>I will continue to blog. I continue to offer myself up for the inevitable brickbats. If along the way some people are encouraged to genuinely engage with the prison debate, that is a price well worth paying. And all along I have a shadow over my shoulder, my victim. I am left alive to live my life; there is nothing else that I can do. Except to live it well, to add to the sum of humanity.</p>",
  "<p>At 10am on Wednesday, Tony Nicklinson finally got what he wanted. In his Wiltshire home, surrounded by those he loved, he slipped into a peaceful death.</p> <p>Less than a week before, millions had seen him outside the high court in his wheelchair, racked with sobs. His wife, Jane, spoke to the TV cameras on his behalf, quietly explaining his distress at the refusal of the court to give him the assurance he had requested: that anyone who helped him to kill himself would not be charged with murder.</p> <p>Once she paused, to wipe away his tears. Even those who disagreed with him, including the judges, were deeply moved.</p> <p>The draft judgment of the court had a devastating impact on Nicklinson. His wife had told his lawyer, Saimo Chahal, that \"the fight seemed to go out of him\". She added: \"He said that he was heartbroken by the high court's decision that he could not end his life at a time of his choosing with the help of a doctor.\"</p> <p>Nicklinson, 58, was paralysed from the neck down, only able to communicate by interacting with a computer through blinking and moving his head. But he had one option left \u2013 refusing food. This he did. Over the weekend, he contracted pneumonia and deteriorated rapidly.</p> <p>He had made an advanced directive back in 2004, a year before a stroke paralysed his body during a business trip to Athens, refusing any life-sustaining treatment.</p> <p>In the end, he died without assistance, with Jane, his daughters, Beth and Lauren, and his sister Ginny beside him.</p> <p>He escaped going to the Swiss assisted-dying group, Dignitas, near Zurich. \"He doesn't see why the hell he should have to go to a foreign country to die in the middle of an industrial estate,\" his wife said after the court case.</p> <p>Nicklinson did not understand how the court could refuse his request for a dignified assisted suicide at home.</p> <p>When Chahal, and Nicklinson's barrister, Paul Bowen QC, visited him last week, two days after the ruling, he spelled out on his computer: \"So, we lost. In truth, I am crestfallen, totally devastated and very frightened. I fear for the future and the misery it is bound to bring.</p> <p>\"I suppose it was wrong of me to invest so much hope and expectation into the judgment but I really believed in the veracity of the arguments and quite simply could not understand how anybody could disagree with the logic. I guess I forgot the&#xa0;emotional&#xa0;component.\"</p> <p>The three judges who heard the case, Lord Justice Toulson, Mr Justice Royce and Mrs Justice Macur, said that in spite of their deep sympathy for Nicklinson \u2013 and a second paralysed man known only as Martin, who also wanted help to die \u2013 it had to be for parliament, not the courts, to decide whether to change the law.</p> <p>Any alterations would need \"the most carefully structured safeguards which only parliament can deliver,\" they said.</p> <p>They stated: \"Voluntary euthanasia is murder, however understandable the motives may be.\" Doctors and solicitors who helped someone die would be \"at real risk of prosecution\".</p> <p>Nicklinson, who had lived an active life before his stroke, playing sport and travelling around the world, found it unbearable to have to be washed, dressed and fed by carers and moved from bed to wheelchair by means of a sling. He described his life as \"dull, miserable, demeaning, undignified and intolerable\". He had been a civil engineer, working for a Greek company but based in the United Arab Emirates, where he was vice-chairman of the Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union.</p> <p>After the stroke, he was left dependent on round-the-clock care. He had said: \"I cannot scratch if I itch. I cannot pick my nose if it is blocked and I can only eat if I am fed like a baby \u2013 only I won't grow out of it, unlike a baby. I have no privacy or dignity left. I am washed, dressed and put to bed by carers who are, after all, still strangers. I am fed up with my life and don't want to spend the next 20 years or so like this.\"</p> <p>Chahal described Nicklinson as \"an extraordinary man\", who was \"gutsy, determined and a fighter to the end\". It had been a privilege to work with him, she said. \"I only wish the outcome had been different during Tony's lifetime.\"</p> <p>She said the legal action he had initiated, which asked for a change to the law of murder to permit assisted suicide, now had to come to an end, but that \"the right to die with dignity, issues Tony championed, will not be forgotten due to the light that [he] shone on them and \u2026 this important debate will continue due to Tony\".</p> <p>Martin's case will continue. His lawyers said on Wednesday they were appealing against the court's decision, which, they said, denied their client \"the opportunity to take necessary steps to end his own life\".</p> <p>Unlike Nicklinson, Martin was not asking for changes in the law on murder. His case was for an assurance of immunity from prosecution for any professional person, such as a lawyer or a doctor, who helped him to die in the UK.</p> <p>This would be like the assurance from Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, who said close family members helping anyone go to Switzerland to die would be unlikely to face prosecution on their return to Britain.</p> <p>While ethicists said Nicklinson's case would cause a spike in public opinion in favour of assisted dying, there was some strong opposition, including among doctors, regarding people not suffering a terminal illness. The Royal College of Physicians said it did not back a law change after the high court ruling. \"It remains illegal for doctors to intentionally and deliberately terminate the life of someone who is not terminally ill.\"</p> <p>A survey of RCP fellows and members in 2006 showed that doctors were not in favour of a change in the law to allow them to do this, said John Saunders, chair of the ethics committee. \"A change in the law would also have severe implications for the way society views disabled people.\"</p> <p>A tweet posted on Nicklinson's profile on Wednesday morning, which was regularly updated for him by members of his family, read: \"You may already know, my dad died peacefully this morning of natural causes. He was 58.\" Another post added his final Twitter message: \"Before he died, he asked us to tweet: 'Goodbye world, the time has come, I had some fun.' \"</p>",

Apple hasn't gone after Google, which writes the Android software, because you can only sue over the actual embodiment of (allegedly) infringing products \u2013 not just the pure software, which Google writes.</p> <p>However, legal opinion is that whoever wins, the loser will appeal and the whole procedure will move up to the court of appeal. That, however, will mean the cases will be heard in front of a judge \u2013 who may display more nous about the finer technical points than a jury. One judge, Richard Posner, has previously dismissed a case in which Apple and Motorola were suing each other, ruling that neither could prove any damage.</p>",
  "<p>Embattled Republican candidate Todd Akin hinted Wednesday for the first time that he might yet bow to the pressure to resign over the rape row that is putting at risk party hopes of taking control of the US Senate in November and disrupting its White House campaign.</p> <p>Akin, in an early morning interview with ABC, insisted he was staying in the race because he is uncomfortable with party bosses dictating who should run. But, asked whether he might yet quit, he said: \"I'm never going to say everything that could possibly happen. I don't know the future.\"</p> <p>The row over Akin's \"legitimate rape\" remark is wrecking carefully laid plans by Mitt Romney in the run-up to the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, next week.</p> <p>Campaign speeches by Romney and his vice-presidential running-mate Paul Ryan on the economy, proposed defence cuts and other issues have been lost amid the Akin row and, to a lesser extent, revelations about a skinny-dipping Republican congressman on a fact-finding trip to Israel.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, an election specialist at George Mason University, said the Republicans had been in a position to make lots of gains in the senate in 2010 but chose Tea Party candidates such as Christine O'Donnell and lost. \"This time what do we see but Akin shoot himself in the foot. It is like the Republicans do not want to win,\" McDonald said.</p> <p>New polls show Romney gained no bounce from his announcement of Ryan as his running mate and that he is running neck-and-neck with Obama. On top of that, weather forecasters are warning that tropical storm Isaac could hit Tampa next week as a hurricane .</p> <p>Akin has rejected calls by Romney, Ryan and other senior Republicans to resign as candidate in Missouri after saying in a television interview on Sunday that \"legitimate rape\" rarely leads to pregnancy, a comment that opened the way for the Democrats to renew their accusations that the Republicans are fighting a war on women.</p> <p>Republican leaders are hoping that Akin will quit if polls show a drop in support in Missouri or his hopes of funding from small donors fail to materialise. Brian Walsh, a spokesman for the Republican senatorial campaign committee, calling on him to go, said the stakes are far bigger than any one individual.</p> <p>William Kristol, the conservative writer who predicted Romney would choose Ryan, wrote in his Weekly Standard blog that Akin had given plenty of indications that he remained open to leaving the field and it was time for those close to Akin to persuade him to stand down.</p> <p>\"I have reason to believe that's now beginning to happen behind the scenes. And I suspect that by the Democratic convention, by Labor Day [September 3], Akin will have stepped aside,\" Kristol wrote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395062394\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345657029881/claire-mccaskill-missouri-010.jpg\" alt=\"claire mccaskill missouri\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Claire McCaskill had trailed Akin by about 10 points before last weekend, and she had been expected by most observers to lose her seat. Photograph: Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Missouri is top of the Republican list of most vulnerable Democratic seats. The Republicans have controlled the House since the November 2010 election and are four seats short of winning control of the Senate. Control of both chambers would allow the Republicans to throw up a series of obstacles to Obama if he was to win a second term and provide a powerful base for pushing Romney, should he win the White House, to the right.</p> <p>The Democrats have a majority of 53 to 47 over the Republicans in the Senate. There are only 33 of the 100 Senate races up for grabs in November, and most of these are safe. Only a handful are in contention, hence the importance of Missouri. After Missouri, the most vulnerable Democratic-held seats, according to political analysts, are Montana, Florida, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. And it is not just a matter of Republicans taking seats but holding ones they already have, such as Massachusetts, held by Republican Scott Brown but traditionally a Democratic stronghold.</p> <p>Brown, along with other Republicans who see the row as damaging was among the first to call for him to resign and his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Warren, issued an ad highlighting the issue Wednesday.</p> <p>Political analysts predict that if Akin remains, it will be make what should be an easy Republican victory in Missouri difficult, with some saying he is unelectable. But others see Missouri as one of the most deeply conservative states in the country, with a high proportion of Christian evangelicals and home-schoolers, and noted that initial polls showed support holding for Akin. <br>Street interviews with residents also showed a willingness to forgive him.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, professor of politics at University of Virginia, who correctly predicted Akin would not quit straight away, expects him to leave soon. \"My sense is he needs time to decompress and adjust. He was not just the candidate but likely to have been the next senator,\" Sabato said.</p> <p>He added: \"This was poorly timed for the convention. Romney and Ryan had wanted to talk about the economy. They are talking about abortion and rape. They did not plan on that.\"</p> <p>As long as Akin is in place, the issue will haunt the Republicans, in particular Ryan, whose stance on rape and abortion is similar \u2013 he is opposed to abortion even in cases of rape or incest.</p> <p>In an interview with KDKA, a CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh, Ryan denounced Akin's comments as outrageous. But when asked whether abortion should be available for women who have been raped, he was ambiguous</p> <p>\"Well, look, I'm proud of my pro-life record. And I stand by my pro-life record in Congress. It's something I'm proud of. But Mitt Romney is the top of the ticket, and Mitt Romney will be president and he will set the policy of the Romney administration,\" Ryan said.</p> <p>Romney, unlike Ryan, is prepared to accept exceptions in the case of rape and incest.</p>",

The second of four daughters, she lived with her mother Virginia in the Spanish Lake neighbourhood of St Louis, about two miles from the bridge. Julie was a volunteer for Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and her family and friends admired her for her strong sense of justice. She had a motto hanging on her bedroom wall: \u201cWho says you can't change the world?\u201d Her mother Ginna told police on the night of the incident: \u201cJulie is a very friendly, trusting and idealistic girl\u201d.</p> <p>Julie's overwhelming enthusiasm was for writing poetry and songs. As her cousin, Jeanine Cummins, puts it in her book about the tragedy, A Rip in Heaven: \u201cJulie was having a full-blown love affair with words. Her poetry was her passion; it helped her to interpret her life, to put things in perspective.\u201d It was poetry that brought Julie and her sister to the bridge that night \u2013 they wanted to show their cousin, Thomas Cummins, a poem Julie had written and that they'd painted on the bridge.</p> <p>Julie's body was found three weeks after she went missing, near Caruthersville, 297 miles downstream. She is buried in Calvary cemetery in St Louis.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-robin-kerry\"> <h2>Robin Kerry</h2> <p>A year younger than her sister Julie, Robin, 19 at the time of her death, was also studying at the University of Missouri-St Louis, in her case linguistics. She was active in the local community, helping six-year-olds with their homework after school at the local Salvation Army family haven. A strict vegetarian, her bedroom was festooned with sculptures she had made and sketches of dragons and fairies.</p> <p>Her cousin Jeanine Cummins wrote that \u201cRobin was bright and defiant. Julie was her mentor, her muse, but Robin was one hundred per cent her own person. She was the shier of the two sisters, but her quiet demeanor masked an ever active wellspring of activity in the mind. She was witty, sarcastic and passionate.\u201d The sisters' mother, Ginna, told police on the night they went missing that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p14/a59323\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cif there was a struggle, Robin would defend herself and sister and would fight to the death\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Robin's body has never been found.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-thomas-cummins\"> <h2>Thomas Cummins</h2> <p>The son of a Catholic deacon from Gaithersburg, Maryland, Tom Cummins was training to become a fire fighter when the Chain of Rocks tragedy occurred. Aged 19, he had travelled with his family to St Louis for the spring break to spend time with his cousin Julie. On the night of the 4 April he drove with Julie and her sister Robin to the bridge to see a poem that Julie had written and painted on it. After the women fell to their deaths, Cummins became the star witness in the prosecution case against Reggie Clemons and his two other black co-defendants. He testified in three separate trials that they had raped his cousins and pushed them into the river, then forced him to jump after them by threatening to shoot him.</p> <p>But police initially <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59316\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">considered Cummins the murderer</a>. Police records suggested that when they first encountered Cummins after he had sounded the alarm they were <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p1/a59324\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">puzzled by his dry and neatly combed hair</a>. Records also show that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p7/a58722\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">when he was questioned by detectives he changed his story several times</a>, at one point saying that Julie had stumbled into the river after he had unwittingly startled her by trying to hug her.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59317\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Police dropped their investigation of Cummins</a> after they corroborated his statement that four other men had been on the bridge that night. Cummins later issued a lawsuit against the St Louis police alleging they had tried to frame him for the murders \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365271-10-tom-cummins-lawsuit.html#document/p11/a59285\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">beating him and then fabricating the police reports</a>  - and he received a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p3/a59197\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">settlement of $150,000</a>.</p> <p>Today he lives back in the north-east of the US.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-daniel-winfrey\"> <h2>Daniel Winfrey</h2> <p>Aged 15, Winfrey was the youngest of the group of four men accused of murdering the Kerry sisters on 4 April, and the only white person among them. He had moved to the small town of Wentzville outside St Louis just three weeks before the incident, where he became friendly with Marlin Gray.</p> <p>At just 5 ft 6 inches, he was described as an awkward teenager, though polite and respectful. He was arrested having been implicated by Thomas Cummins as one of the four perpetrators. After interrogation, he agreed to turn prosecution witness, confessing that he had been involved in robbing Cummins and the sisters and had held down the women but had not raped them. He gave evidence in court in the three separate trials of his co-defendants in exchange for a lesser charge of second-degree murder for which he pleaded guilty and received a 30-year sentence.</p> <p>Winfrey was a key witness for the prosecution whose testimony was crucial to the conviction of Reggie Clemons, testifying he had seen Clemons rape the sisters. By his own account, though, he was not on the bridge at the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p8/a58723\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">moment the Kerry sisters fell into the river</a>. He didn't <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p9/a58724\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cknow what happened down there\u201d and he \u201cnever saw what went on after [Cummins] was put in the hole\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Winfrey was released on parole in 2007. He now lives outside St Louis with his mother. When the Guardian visited him, he said: \u201cI have nothing to say. Talk to my lawyer.\u201d</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-marlin-gray\"> <h2>Marlin Gray</h2> <p>Marlin Gray, 23 at the time, was the oldest of the four men accused of murdering the Kerry sisters. On the evening of 4 April he was driving around Wentzville when he spotted Daniel Winfrey who he had got to know shortly before, and the two of them went off to visit Gray's friend Reggie Clemons in St Louis.</p> <p>After the four were arrested, Winfrey told police that Gray had had the initial idea to go back on the bridge and accost the Kerry sisters and their cousin, alleging that Gray had said he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p12/a58904\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cfelt like hurting someone\u201d</a>. Gray also made a confession to police, but shortly afterwards retracted it, saying <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365270-8-marlin-gray-clemency.html#document/p5/a59282\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">it had been beaten out of him</a>. Winfrey and Thomas Cummins testified at Gray's trial that he had raped the women. Cummins said that Gray had threatened to \u201cpop him\u201d. But by their account, Gray had left the bridge by the time the women were allegedly forced into the river and he was found guilty of murder as an accomplice. Gray continued to insist he was innocent until 26 October 2005 when he was executed by lethal injection. Before he died, he made a final statement. He said: <a href=\"http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/gray989.htm\">\"I go with a peace of mind that comes from never having taken a human life. This is not a death, it is a lynching.\u201d</a></p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-reggie-clemons\"> <h2>Reggie Clemons</h2> <p>Born on 30 August 1971, Clemons was the youngest of six children of Roosevelt and Vera Robinson (now Thomas). Clemons had a difficult childhood, suffering from abuse on the part of his father. Vera eventually divorced Roosevelt, and remarried a church pastor, Reynolds Thomas, when Clemons was six years old. Clemons's home background stabilised, and by the time of the Chain of Rocks incident, aged 19, he was described as a compassionate and caring teenager who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p3/a58725\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">showed no inclination towards violence and had no previous criminal record</a>.</p> <p>Clemons was put on trial for the murder of the Kerry sisters on the basis of his own <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p5/a58727\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">confession to raping one of the women and on the testimony of Thomas Cummins and Daniel Winfrey</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Clemons complained two days after he had made the confession that it had been beaten out of him</a>.</p> <p>Cummins told the jury at the trial that he heard Clemons and Winfrey discussing whether he should be allowed to live or die. But neither Cummins nor Winfrey testified that they had seen Clemons push the women into the river, and the prosecution did not allege that he had done so, arguing he was an accomplice to murder.</p> <p>Clemons, who has consistently proclaimed his innocence, is being held at the Potosi Correctional Center in Missouri. He was sentenced to death on 18 February 1993 and has been on death row ever since.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-antonio-richardson\"> <h2>Antonio Richardson</h2> <p>Richardson lived around the corner from his cousin, Reggie Clemons, in a suburb of St Louis. Aged 16 at the time of his arrest, he was brought up by a succession of relatives and suffered periods of abandonment. By 15 he had a drug and alcohol problem, and dropped out of school.</p> <p>At trial, his lawyer presented the jury with evidence of Richardson's impaired mental capacity and brain damage. Richardson was the first of the four co-defendants to be arrested after police found a flashlight on the bridge that he had stolen and lost on the night of the murders. Under questioning, Richardson turned on Marlin Gray and Clemons, saying that they had killed the Kerry sisters. But at his trial Thomas Cummins, the sisters' cousin, said it was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Richardson who pushed the women in and then ordered him to jump after them</a>.</p> <p>In July 1993 Richardson was found guilty of murder, but the jury was unable to decide whether or not he should be given the death penalty. In their place, the trial judge put him on death row. He came within an hour of execution in March 2001, and two years later had his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365264-6-clemons-cert.html#document/p18/a59196\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">death sentence commuted to life imprisonment with no chance of parole</a>.

The main witness against him, Thomas Cummins, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p50/a58880\">testified that he saw a \"black hand\"</a> push his cousins into the river <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p14/a58876\">but failed to specify whose hand that was</a>. Yet in the separate trial of co-defendant Antonio Richardson, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p7/a58707\">Cummins said that it was Richardson</a> who pushed the women into the river.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Clemons <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365259-2-clemons-confession.html#document/p13/a58852\">confessed to raping Robin Kerry</a>, but <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p2/a58850\">did not confess to murder</a></strong>. He was found guilty of murder as an accomplice.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Two days after Clemons made the confession, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p1/a58855\">he retracted it</a></strong>. He told St Louis police internal affairs officers that he had been beaten, punched in the chest and had his head slammed against the wall. He alleged that after hours of being assaulted he agreed to read out a confession that police officers had written in advance, because if he had refused to do so <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p37/a58860\">\"they would have beat me some more\"</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Police photos show that Clemons looked physically fit when he was first picked up by police, but after his was interrogated <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p17/a58882\">he was reported by several witnesses to have a swollen right cheek</a></strong>. When he came before a judge for arraignment, the judge sent him to the local hospital ER for examination, where he was diagnosed with <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p17/a59198\">muscle inflammation and a swollen face</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Clemons's claims of police brutality were strikingly similar to independent complaints of police beatings <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365270-8-marlin-gray-clemency.html#document/p5/a59282\">made by his co-defendant Marlin Gray</a> and by <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p15/a59199\">Thomas Cummins</a></strong>, the main prosecution witness against him, even though the three men had no contact with each other. All three sets of complaints related to interrogations that occurred within the same police station involving the same alleged techniques of assault, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p9/a58713\">and all within the same 48-hour time span</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Clemons's complaint of police brutality was dismissed and he was put on death row, as was Gray</strong>. But when Cummins <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365271-10-tom-cummins-lawsuit.html#document/p10/a59284\">sued the St Louis police for misconduct</a> \u2013 claiming that detectives had tried to frame him for the murders and had <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365271-10-tom-cummins-lawsuit.html#document/p11/a59285\">fabricated police records</a> \u2013 he won a <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p3/a59197\">settlement of $150,000</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Clemons, a black man, was convicted of murder largely on the basis of eyewitness accounts of two men, both of whom were white and both of whom arguably had a self-interest in implicating him</strong>. <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59316\">Thomas Cummins was initially considered the prime suspect</a> , though the investigation against him was <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59317\">later dropped</a>, and Daniel Winfrey achieved a plea bargain in which he would testify against Clemons in exchange for avoiding execution himself. Winfrey was overheard saying before the trial that \"he would take any plea bargain offered\" and \"<a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p36/a58884\">say anything he had to to obtain a plea bargain\"</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>There was <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p6/a58887\">no physical evidence</a> to support the murder and rape allegations against Clemons</strong>. The human rights group the Constitution Project has shown that that three-quarters of all prisoners exonerated in the US in recent years were convicted at least in part on the basis of faulty eyewitness testimony.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Cummins changed the story he gave police several times, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366740-24-police-incident-report.html#document/p10/a59314\">police records suggest</a></strong>. His highly inconsistent account given in the records either strengthens his claim that he was beaten up by police \u2013 which in turn supports Clemons's allegation that his confession was beaten out of him, too \u2013 or implies that Cummins was an unreliable source upon whom the prosecution should not have depended as star witness.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>One of the stories told by Cummins, as related by police notes, was that Julie Kerry had stumbled into the Mississippi after <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366740-24-police-incident-report.html#document/p11/a59312\">he startled her by trying to hug her</a></strong>. \"He just wanted to hug her but she became startled, lost her balance and fell into the river,\" the police incident report records. Her sister Robin then jumped into the river to try and save her. Cummins later sued the police for alleged brutality and falsification of their notes.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>As the judicial process got under way, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p11/a58714\">Clemons was denied a state-funded defence lawyer</a></strong> because he was told that all the registered state lawyers were busy at the time.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Two private lawyers, Robert Constantinou and Jeanene Moenckmeier, were employed by Clemons's family to represent him</strong>. Moenckmeier has told the Guardian that she was given insufficient time to review boxes of evidence provided by the prosecutors under discovery. She has also complained that crucial evidence may have been withheld from her by the prosecution.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The two lawyers were going through a divorce at the time of Clemons's trial. Moenckmeier was in the process of moving to California to take a job as a tax lawyer</strong>. A separate team of defence lawyers, who processed Clemons's later clemency appeal, alleged in court documents that the original trial lawyers \"failed him at every stage of his representation\", including <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p12/a58715\">failure to review the police reports</a> up to a month before the trial. Moenckmeier denied to the Guardian that either the divorce or the move to California had adversely affected her representation of Clemons.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>A \"rape kit\" recording the results of tests on Julie Kerry's body after it was retrieved from the Mississippi was not presented to the jury in Clemons's trial</strong>, despite the fact that the allegation Clemons raped one of the Kerry sisters was an important part of the prosecution case against him. Nor was the rape kit <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366831-25-motion-to-compel-discovery.html#document/p1/a59325\">disclosed to his defence lawyers before trial</a>, even though they had specifically requested in writing to see \"all evidence from the sheriff's department, police department and medical examiner's office who investigated and examined the recovery of the body of Julie Kerry\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>When the trial started in January 1993, seven prospective jurors \u2013 all of them black \u2013 were <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p67/a58889\">improperly excluded from the jury</a></strong>. A federal judge later found that this was unconstitutional, and ruled that Clemons's death sentence <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p13/a58716\">should be commuted to life imprisonment</a> as a result. The state of Missouri managed to overturn that ruling on a legal technicality, allowing the death penalty to stand.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The final composition of the jury was two black jurors and 10 white</strong>, in a city where 49% of the population is African American.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The prosecutor in the case, Nels Moss, was <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p16/a58717\">heavily criticised after the event for his conduct</a></strong> during the trial. As court documents show, the district court that reviewed the case called his behaviour during trial \"abusive and boorish\" and \"calculated to intimidate the defence at every turn\".</p> <p>\u2022 Before the trial began, <strong>Moss was specifically ordered by the trial judge, Edward Peek, to refrain from highly contentious tactics he had deployed at the previous trial of co-defendant Marlin Gray</strong>. But as documents lodged with the Missouri supreme court show, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p47/a58890\">Moss blatantly ignored the order</a>. He did precisely what he had been told not to do: to compare in front of the jury Clemons \u2013 a 19-year-old with no previous criminal record \u2013 to the notorious serial killers Charles Manson and John Wayne Gacy. A week after Clemons was sentenced to death, Peek found that Moss's conduct had been \"willfully and intentionally committed in disobedience of the court\" and <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p16/a58718\">fined him $500 for criminal contempt</a>. But, still, the death sentence was allowed to stand.</p> <p>\u2022 According to papers filed by Clemons' appeal lawyers to the Missouri supreme court, <strong>Moss addressed the jury in impassioned terms that the <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p44/a58899\">lawyers argued amounted to inflaming the jury</a></strong>. He asked the jury to imagine a hypothetical crime in which the Kerry sisters were raped, put into a \"dark room\" and repeatedly stabbed. \"This hypothetical had nothing to do with the trial, but everything to do with Moss's goal to have an inflamed and upset jury\". Moss has declined to talk to the Guardian ahead of the special hearing into the Clemons case in September.</p> <p>\u2022 A member of the jury at Clemons's trial submitted an affidavit stating that <strong>if she had known of the discrepancies in the way the trial was conducted, <a class=\"gia-dc-inline\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p2/a58720\">she would not have voted for the death penalty</a>.</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The state boundary between Missouri and Illinois falls down the middle of the Chain of Rocks bridge, which became a matter of great legal contention at trial. Lawyers argued over the precise location of an uncovered manhole on the bridge through which the Kerry sisters and Cummins were alleged to have been forced before being pushed into the river.</p> <p>The prosecution said that the manhole lay on the Missouri side of the state line, which they used to claim jurisdiction over the case. But the defense argued the manhole had been located a few feet to the east on the Illinois side of the bridge, and that therefore the trial should have been in the Illinois courts. In the early 1990s Illinois was much less inclined to hand out death sentences than Missouri, so just a few feet could have been crucial. In fact, had the trial taken place today it would undoubtedly had been a matter of life or death: Illinois abolished the death penalty in March 2011 while Missouri<br>still has 47 death row inmates awaiting execution.</p>",
  "<p>Labour's deputy leader has called on politicians of all political parties to work together to legislate for the breakup of the Murdoch family's media empire in the UK on the eve of a keynote speech from Rupert's daughter Elisabeth at the Edinburgh International Television festival.</p> <p>Harriet Harman, declaring that \"the age of deference to the Murdochs is over\", said she wanted to make an \"open offer\" to the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to hold talks on setting tighter limits for media ownership once Lord Justice Leveson's report into press standards is published.</p> <p>She said there was a historic opportunity for politicians to legislate and it was time \"to deal with the issue of the invincibility of the Murdoch media empire\", reaching cross-party agreement in a way that she said should be about \"nobody gaining political advantage\".</p> <p>It would be appropriate for politicians \"to listen respectfully\" to the address from Elisabeth Murdoch \u2013 herself out of step with the family's response to the phone-hacking crisis \u2013 but that \"the context had changed entirely\" from when her brother James Murdoch gave the same lecture three years ago. \"This is the second time in three years we have heard from the same family,\" Harman said.</p> <p>Her speech is expected to set out a personal agenda that differs noticeably from that of her brother, who is still number three at News Corp. In 2009, James Murdoch sharply criticised the BBC and Ofcom and ended his remarks by observing that for news media \"the only \u2026 guarantor of independence is profit\".</p> <p>A fortnight after making those remarks, James Murdoch met David Cameron for breakfast at the George club in London and told him privately that the Sun, Britain's best selling newspaper, would come out and back the Conservatives \u2013 an endorsement that was made public three weeks later during the Labour party conference.</p> <p>Labour has already indicated that it believes Murdoch's News Corp \u2013 which owns the Sun, the Times titles and a 39% stake in Sky \u2013 has too much media influence. Party leader Ed Miliband told the Leveson inquiry that he believed that one company should not own the Sun and Times, which account for 37% of newspaper sales in the UK.</p> <p>However, Harman's remarks demonstrate Labour's seriousness in taking on the family-controlled media empire \u2013 and the attempt to kickstart cross-party talks on future legislation in an effort to keep the issue on the agenda.</p> <p>Reiterating the party's position, Harman said News Corp owned \"too much\" across all media, and in newspapers in particular. She said News Corp's current share of 37% was too high for any one publisher, although there was debate about where the cap should be set. The only way that News Corp could reduce its share of newspaper sales significantly would be by selling the Sun or the Times titles.</p> <p>She said she hoped to reach cross-party agreement on how to implement press reform proposals put forward by Leveson in the autumn \u2013 but added that \"we can't wind up leaving the problem of media ownership untouched\" at the conclusion of the public inquiry.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II)</strong></p> <p>Earlier this week, British lawyer and legal correspondent for the New Statesman David Allen Green generated a fair amount of attention by <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/08/five-legal-myths-about-assange-extradition\">announcing that he would use his objective legal expertise</a> to bust what he called \"legal myths about the Assange extradition.\" These myths, he said, are being irresponsibly spread by Assange defenders and \"are like 'zombie facts' which stagger on even when shot down.\" </p> <p>In addition to his other credentials, Green \u2013 like virtually the entire British press \u2013 is a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/human-rights/2012/06/desperation-julian-assange\">long-time and deeply devoted Assange-basher</a>, and his purported myth-busting was <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5936600/\">predictably regurgitated</a> by those who reflexively grasp onto anything that reflects poorly on western establishmentarians' public enemy No1. It's really worth examining what Green argued to understand the behavior in which Assange detractors engage to advance this collective vendetta, and also to see how frequently blatant ideological agendas masquerade as high-minded, objective legal expertise.</p> <p>But before getting to that, let us pause to reflect on a truly amazing and revealing fact, one that calls for formal study in several academic fields of discipline. Is it not remarkable that one of the very few individuals over the past decade to risk his welfare, liberty and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334341/WikiLeaks-Sarah-Palin-demands-Julian-Assange-hunted-like-Al-Qaeda-terrorist.html\">even</a><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/fox-news-bob-beckel-calls_n_793467.html\"> life</a> to meaningfully challenge the secrecy regime on which the American national security state (and those of its <a href=\"http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/03/un-torture-investigator-warns-uk-over.php\">obedient allies</a>) depends just so happens to have become \u2013 long before he sought asylum from Ecuador \u2013 the most intensely and personally despised figure among the American and British media class and the British \"liberal\" intelligentsia? </p> <p>In 2008 \u2013 two years before the release of the \"collateral murder\" video, the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, and the diplomatic cables \u2013 the Pentagon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/us/18wiki.html\">prepared a secret report</a> which proclaimed WikiLeaks to be an enemy of the state and <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MnYI3_FRbbQ/S64J1rmc53I/AAAAAAAACWI/wiLUSVixG5U/s1600/pentagon2.png\">plotted ways to destroy</a> its credibility and reputation. But in a stroke of amazing luck, Pentagon operatives never needed to do any of that, because the establishment media in the US and Britain harbor at least as much intense personal loathing for the group's founder as the US government does, and eagerly took the lead in targeting him. Many people like to posit the US national security state and western media outlets as adversarial forces, but here \u2013 as is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/international/middleeast/26FTE_NOTE.html?pagewanted=all\">so often the case</a> \u2013 they have so harmoniously joined in common cause.</p> <p>Whatever else is true, establishment media outlets show unlimited personal animus toward the person who, as a panel of judges <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/02/julian-assange-martha-gelhorn-prize\">put it</a> when they awarded him the the 2011 Martha Gellhorn prize for journalism, \"has given the public more scoops than most journalists can imagine.\" Similarly, when the Australian version of the Pulitzers \u2013 the Walkley Foundation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.walkleys.com/news/5131/\">awarded its highest distinction</a> (for \"Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism\") to WikiLeaks in 2011, it <a href=\"http://www.walkleys.com/2011winners#most-outstanding-contribution-to-journalism\">cited</a> the group's \"courageous and controversial commitment to the finest traditions of journalism: justice through transparency,\" and observed: \"So many eagerly took advantage of the secret cables to create <em>more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime</em>.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the American media, I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/11/30/wikileaks_10/\">long noted</a> this revealing paradox. The person who (along with whomever is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/14/bradley-manning-deserves-a-medal\">the heroic leaker</a>) enabled \"more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime\" \u2013 and who was quickly branded an enemy by the Pentagon and a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/19/joe-biden-wikileaks-assange-high-tech-terrorist_n_798838.html\">terrorist by high U.S. officials</a> \u2013 is the most hated figure among establishment journalists, even though they are ostensibly devoted to precisely these values of transparency and exposing serious government wrongdoing. (This transparency was imposed not only <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/24/wikileaks_23/\">on the US and its allies</a>, but also some of the <a href=\"http://ggdrafts.blogspot.com.br/2011/10/bill-keller-on-wikileaks-cables.html\">most oppressive regimes in the Arab world</a>). </p> <p>But the contempt is far more intense, and bizarrely personal, from the British press, much of which behaves with staggering levels of mutually-reinforcing vindictiveness and groupthink when it's time to scorn an outsider like Assange. On Tuesday, Guardian columnist Seumas Milne wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/why-us-is-out-to-get-assange\">a superb analysis</a> of British media coverage of Assange, and observed that \"the virulence of British media hostility towards the WikiLeaks founder is now unrelenting.\" Milne noted that to the British press, Assange \"is nothing but a 'monstrous narcissist', a bail-jumping 'sex pest' and an exhibitionist maniac\" \u2013 venom spewed at someone \"who has yet to be charged, let alone convicted, of anything.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the personalized nature of this contempt from self-styled sober journalists often borders on the creepy (when it's not wildly transgressing that border). Former New York Times' executive editor Bill Keller infamously quoted an email from a Times reporter <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Wikileaks-t.html?pagewanted=all\">claiming</a> that Assange wore \"filthy white socks that collapsed around his ankles\" and \"smelled as if he hadn't bathed in days.\" On the very same day WikiLeaks released over 400,000 classified documents showing genuinely horrific facts about massive civilian deaths in the Iraq war and US complicity in torture by Iraqi forces, the New York Times front-paged <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/24assange.html?hp\">an article</a> purporting to diagnose Assange with a variety of psychological afflictions and concealed, malicious motives, based on its own pop-psychology observations and those of Assange's enemies (\"erratic and imperious behavior\", \"a nearly delusional grandeur\", \"he is not in his right mind\", \"pursuing a vendetta against the United States\").</p> <p>A columnist for the Independent, Joan Smith, recently watched Assange's interview of Ecuadorean president Rafeal Correa and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/joan-smith/joan-smith-why-do-we-buy-julian-assanges-oneman-psychodrama-7869897.html\">offered up this wisdom</a>: \"He's put on weight, his face is puffy and he didn't bother to shave before his interview with Correa.\" And perhaps most psychologically twisted of all: a team of New York Times reporters and editors last week, in its lead article about Ecuador's decision to grant asylum, decided it would be appropriate to <a href=\"http://gregmitchellwriter.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/nyt-flushes-assange-charges.html\">include a quote</a> from one of Assange's most dedicated enemies claiming that when the WikiLeaks founder was a visitor in his apartment, he \"refused to flush the toilet during his entire stay\" (faced with a barrage of mockery and disgust over their reporting on Assange's alleged toilet habits, the NYT sheepishly deleted that passage without comment).</p> <p>It is difficult to think of anyone this side of Saddam Hussein who triggers this level of personalized, deeply ingrained hatred from establishment journalists. Few who spew this vitriol would dare speak with the type of personalized scorn toward, say, George Bush or Tony Blair \u2013 who actually launched an aggressive war that resulted in the deaths of at least 100,000 innocent people and kidnapped people from around the globe with no due process and sent them to be tortured. The reaction Assange inspires among establishment media figures is really sui generis.</p> <p>It is vital to note, as was just demonstrated, that this media contempt long pre-dates, and exists wholly independent of, the controversy surrounding the sex assault allegations in Sweden, and certainly long pre-dates his seeking of asylum from Ecuador. Indeed, given that he has not been convicted of anything, to assume Assange's guilt would be reprehensible \u2013 every bit as reprehensible as concluding that the allegations are a CIA ruse or that the complainants' allegations should be dismissed as frivolous or inherently untrustworthy. </p> <p>It would be genuinely nice to think that the same British government that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/13/pinochet.chile6\">refused to extradite</a> the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/victims-of-pinochets-police-prepare-to-reveal-details-of-rape-and-torture-1183793.html\">mass rapist</a> Augusto Pinochet has suddenly developed a devoted passion for ensuring that alleged sex assault offenders are brought to justice \u2013 just as it would be nice to believe that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/human-rights-critics-russia-ecuador\">sudden interest</a> in denouncing Ecuador's press freedom record was driven by some newly discovered and authentic concern in the west for civil liberties protections in South America. But as Milne put it last night with great understatement: \"such posturing looks increasingly specious.\" As he rhetorically asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Can anyone seriously believe the dispute would have gone global, or that the British government would have made its asinine threat to suspend the Ecuadorean embassy's diplomatic status and enter it by force, or that scores of police would have surrounded the building, swarming up and down the fire escape and guarding every window, if it was all about one man wanted for questioning over sex crime allegations in Stockholm?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Like those who suddenly discover the imperatives of feminism when it comes time to justify the war in Afghanistan, or those who become overnight advocates of gay rights when it comes time to demonize the regime in Tehran, or those who took a very recent interest in Ecuadorean press freedoms, these sex assault allegations -- as serious and deserving of legal resolution as they are -- are being cynically exploited as a political weapon by many who have long despised Assange for reasons entirely independent of this case.</p> <p>* * * * * </p> <p>There are several obvious reasons why Assange provokes such unhinged media contempt. The most obvious among them is competition: the resentment generated by watching someone outside their profession generate more critical scoops in a year than all other media outlets combined (see <a href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/001990.html\">this brilliant 2008 post</a>, in the context of the Clintons, about how professional and ego-based competition produces personal hatred like nothing else can).</p> <p>Other causes are more subtle though substantive. Many journalists (and liberals) like to wear the costume of outsider-insurgent, but are, at their core, devoted institutionalists, faithful believers in the goodness of their society's power centers, and thus resent those (like Assange) who actually and deliberately place themselves outside of it. By putting his own liberty and security at risk to oppose the world's most powerful factions, Assange has clearly demonstrated what happens to real adversarial dissidents and insurgents \u2013 they're persecuted, demonized, and threatened, not befriended by and invited to parties within the halls of imperial power \u2013 and he thus causes many journalists to stand revealed as posers, servants to power, and courtiers.</p> <p>Then there's the ideological cause. As one long-time British journalist told me this week when discussing the vitriol of the British press toward Assange: \"Nothing delights British former lefties more than an opportunity to defend power while pretending it is a brave stance in defence of a left liberal principle.\" That's the warped mindset that led to so many of these self-styled liberal journalists <a href=\"http://eustonmanifesto.org/the-euston-manifesto/\">to support the attack on Iraq</a> and other acts of Western aggression in the name of liberal values. And it's why nothing triggers their rage like fundamental critiques of, and especially meaningful opposition to, the institutions of power to which they are unfailingly loyal.</p> <p>* * * * * </p> <p>With that context established, let us return to David Allen Green. The attacks on those who have defended Assange's extradition and asylum arguments has depended on the disgusting slander that such advocates are indifferent to the allegations of sexual assault made against him or, worse, are \"rape apologists.\" </p> <p>The reality is exactly the opposite. I have spoken to countless Assange defenders over the last couple of years and not a single one \u2013 literally not one \u2013 is dismissive of the need for those allegations in Sweden to be taken seriously and to be legally and fairly resolved. Typifying this view is Milne's column last night, which in the midst of scorning the attacks on Assange, embraced \"the seriousness of the rape allegations made against Assange, for which he should clearly answer and, if charges are brought, stand trial.\" </p> <p>That is the view of every Assange defender with a platform that I know of, including me (one can certainly find anonymous internet commenters, or the occasional named one, making actual, horrific rape apologist claims, but one can find stray advocates saying anything; imputing those views to Assange defenders generally would be like claiming that all Assange critics want to see him illegally shot in the head or encaged for life because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334341/WikiLeaks-Sarah-Palin-demands-Julian-Assange-hunted-like-Al-Qaeda-terrorist.html\">some prominent American</a> and <a href=\"http://www.peopleokwithmurderingassange.com/the_list.html\">other commentators</a> have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRMV7zi4h_k\">called for this</a>).</p> <p>Not only Assange defenders, but also his own lawyers and the Ecuadorean government, have worked relentlessly to ensure that <em>he faces those allegations in Sweden</em>. They have merely sought to do so in a way that protects him from extradition to the US to face espionage charges for his journalism \u2013 a threat that could send him to prison for life (likely in a torturous super-max facility), and a threat only the wilfuly blind could deny is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112905973.html\">serious and real</a>. </p> <p>In their <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/wikileaks-and-the-global-future-of-free-speech.html?ref=opinion\">New York Times op-ed this week</a>, Michael Moore and Oliver Stone correctly argue that it is \"the British and Swedish governments that stand in the way of [the sex assault] investigation, not Mr Assange.\" That's because, they note, Assange has repeatedly offered to be questioned by Swedish authorities in London, or to travel <em>today</em> to Sweden to face those allegations if he could be assured that his doing so would not result in his extradition to the US to face espionage charges. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/rafael-correa-britain-julian-assange_n_1820515.html\">Time and again</a>, \"Correa said Ecuador never intended to stop Assange from facing justice in Sweden. 'What we've asked for is guarantees that he won't be extradited to a third country,' he said.\" Both <em>Britain and Sweden have steadfastly refused even to discuss any agreement that could safeguard both the rights of the complainants and Assange's rights not to be imprisoned for basic journalism.</em></p> <p>These facts \u2013 and they are facts \u2013 pose a lethal threat to the key false narrative that Assange and his defenders are motivated by a desire to evade his facing the sex assault allegations in Sweden. So these facts need to be impugned, and that's where David Allen Green and his \"myth-busting\" legal expertise comes into play.</p> <p>One myth Green purports to debunk is the notion that \"the Swedes should interview Assange in London.\" This cannot be, Green argues, because \"Assange is not wanted merely for questioning. He is wanted for arrest.\" He also echoes numerous other Assange critics by arguing that the \"he-has-not-yet-been-charged\" claim is a mere technical irrelevancy: the only reason this is true, he says, is because he must be in Sweden for that to happen.</p> <p>But back in early 2011, Assange critics were telling a much different story. Back then, they were arguing that Assange was wildly overstating the danger he faced from extradition to Sweden because the investigation there was at such a preliminary stage and he was merely wanted for questioning. Indeed, here's what the very same David Allen Green <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/02/assange-eaw-sexual-sweden\">wrote on 28 February 2011</a> when explaining the status of the investigation to his readers [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This extradition order does not necessarily mean, of course, that he will be extradited, <em>still less that he will be charged</em>, tried, or convicted. Assange may win an appeal of the extradition order, or Sweden may decide either not to continue or to <em>interview him while he remains in England</em>. However, unless some such external event intervenes, Assange will be shortly extradited to Sweden <em>to be questioned</em> about an allegation of rape, two allegations of sexual molestation, and an allegation of unlawful coercion.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Back when it suited Green, he emphasized that Assange has not been charged with any crime, that there is far from any certainty that he would be, and that extradition to Sweden is merely for him \"to be questioned\" on these allegations: exactly the \"myths\" and \"zombie facts\" which he now purports to bust. Moreover, Swedish law professor Marten Schultz, who strongly supports Assange's extradition to Sweden, has <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/justice-for-sweden\">said the same</a> [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The UK supreme court's decision means <em>only that Assange will be transferred to Sweden for interrogation. </em>It does not mean that he will be tried, or <em>even charged</em>. It is entirely possible that he will be transferred to Sweden, questioned, and released if the Swedish authorities find that there are insufficient grounds for prosecution. It is impossible \u2013 as it should be \u2013 to predict how the case will unfold.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly, as Green himself used to acknowledge, Assange at this point is wanted for questioning in this case, and has not been charged. Once he's questioned, he might be charged, or the case might be dropped. That is what has made the Swedes' steadfast refusal to question him in England so mystifying, of such concern to Assange, and is the real reason that the investigation has thus far been obstructed. Indeed, Swedish legal expert Ove Bring has <a href=\"https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5235707\">made clear</a>, in the context of discussing Assange, that \"under Swedish law it is possible to interrogate people abroad,\" but that Sweden is refusing to do so simply for reasons of \"prestige\" (he added: \"If he goes to Sweden, is interrogated, then I expect the case would be dropped, as <em>the evidence is not enough to charge him with a crime</em>\").</p> <p>Then there's the very strange argument Green makes about why extradition to the US would be more easily accomplished if he's in Britain rather than Sweden. I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-right-asylum\">previously set out</a> the reasons and supporting evidence showing the reverse is true and won't repeat those here, but let's look at what Green says to support his claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>One can add that there is no evidence whatsoever that the United Kingdom would not swiftly comply with any extradition request from the United States; quite the reverse. Ask Gary McKinnon, or Richard O'Dwyer, or the NatWest Three.</p> </blockquote> <p>The US has been seeking McKinnon's extradition from Britain for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/24/gary-mckinnon-extradition-review-hacker\">a full seven years and counting</a>; O'Dwyer also remains in England and is the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/06/richard-odwyer-extradition-opposed-majority\">popular campaign to block his shipment to the U.S.</a>; the NatWest Three were able to<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5160094.stm\"> resist extradition to the US for four full years</a>. These cases disprove, rather than prove, that an extradition demand from the US would be \"swiftly complied with\" in Britain. In contrast to the secretive Swedish judicial system, there is substantial public debate along with transparent (and protracted) judicial proceedings in Britain over extradition.</p> <p>It is true, as Green notes, that the Swedish government cannot provide an iron-clad \"guarantee\" that Assange would not be extradited to the US. That's because it is Swedish courts, and not the government, that make the ultimate decision on extradition. But both the British and Swedish governments play an important role in any extradition proceeding: they take influential positions on whether extradition is legally warranted. Under Britain's extradition treaty, it must consent to the subsequent extradition of any individual it extradites (meaning its consent would be needed for Sweden to send Assange to the U.S.), while in Sweden, the government <a href=\"http://www.firmmagazine.com/features/1179/Assange_-_what%27s_going_on%3F.html\">must formally opine</a> on whether extradition should take place (some Swedes have<a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\"> made the case</a> that the government's position would be dispositive).</p> <p>At the very least, there is ample room for negotiation. Both the British and Swedish governments could \u2013 and should \u2013 take the position that to prosecute Assange under espionage statutes for acts of journalism would be political crimes that are not subject to their extradition treaties with the U.S. or are otherwise not cognizable extradition offenses. Rather than explore any of those possible grounds for agreement, both governments have simply refused to negotiate either with Assange's lawyers or the Ecuadorean government over any proposals to safeguard his rights. That refusal on the part of those governments \u2013 and not any desire to obstruct the investigation or evade facing those allegations \u2013 is what led the Ecuadoreans to conclude that asylum was necessary to protect Assange from political persecution.</p> <p>The complainants in Sweden have the absolute right to have their serious allegations against Assange investigated and legally resolved. But Assange has the equally compelling right under international law and treaties to be free of political persecution: which is exactly what prosecuting him (and perhaps imprisoning him for life) in the US for WikiLeaks' disclosures would be. </p> <p>It is vital that both sets of rights be safeguarded, not just one. The only just solution is one that protects both. Assange's lawyers and the Ecuadorians have repeatedly pursued arrangements to vindicate all substantial rights at stake so that he can travel to Sweden \u2013 today \u2013 to face those allegations while being protected against unjust extradition to the US. It is the refusal of the British and Swedish authorities even to consider any such proposals that have brought this situation to the unfortunate standstill it is in.</p> <p>It is incredibly telling that media attacks on Assange do not even pay lip service to, let alone evince any actual interest in, the profound threats to press freedom that would come if he were extradited to and tried in the United States. In lieu of being informed about any of this, readers and viewers are bombarded with disturbing, and often quite disturbed, rants driven by unrestrained personal contempt. That contempt not only drowns out every important value at stake in this case, but also any regard for the basic facts.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: Numerous people objected that I too readily conceded the point that Swedish courts, rather than the Swedish government, are the ultimate decision-makers on extradition requests, and the Swedish government therefore cannot provide Assange with a guarantee that he will not be extradited to the U.S. <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">This article</a> by a lawyer -- who fervently believes that Assange should be extradited to Sweden -- makes the case very compellingly that the Swedish government most certainly can provide such a guarantee if it chose to [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>Extradition procedures are typically of a mixed nature, where courts and governments share the final decision \u2013 it is not unknown for <em>governments to reject an extradition request in spite of court verdict allowing it</em>. . . . </p> <p>Article 12 [of Sweden's extradition law] adds that the government may put conditions on its decision to accept an extradition request. <em>The deciding body is thus the government</em>, with an input by the Prosecutor general and a veto right given to the Supreme Court in case where the requested person doesn't accept to be extradited.</p> </blockquote> <p>The article goes on to cite the Swedish extradition law to outline two possible outcomes where the target of an extradition request challenges its validity: (1) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is not legally permissible, in which case the Swedish government is not free to extradite; (2) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is legally permissible, in which case the Swedish government is free to decide that it will not extradite for policy or other prudential reasons. In other words, the Swedish judiciary has the right to <em>block</em> an extradition request on legal grounds, but it lacks the power to<em> compel</em> extradition; if the courts approve of the legal basis, the Swedish government still retains the authority to decide if extradition should take place.</p> <p>As indicated, even if it were true that Swedish government was an unable to offer Assange a so-called \"iron-clad guarantee\" against extradition, there is still grounds to negotiate in order to have him travel to Sweden to face these allegations; given that the Swedish government clearly has, at the very least, a significant role to play in the process, its advanced position against Assange's extradition to the U.S. on the basis of WikiLeaks' journalistic disclosures would be significant. But there is at least a strong argument to make, if not an irrefutable one, that the Swedish government is able to offer precisely the guarantee that both Assange and Ecuadorean authorities have sought in order to enable him immediately to travel to Sweden to face the sex assault allegations against him. Independently, the British government is also clearly in a position to contribute to those assurances, given the need for its consent if extradition to the U.S. from Sweden is to take place. </p> <p>If one wants to find a culprit for why these sex assault allegations are not being resolved the way they should be, the refusal of these two governments even to negotiate to secure Assange's clear rights against unjust extradition is the place to begin.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE II</em></strong>: For even more compelling evidence that the Swedish government is the final decision-maker in extradition matters and does indeed have the power to guarantee Assange that he would not be extradited to the U.S. based on his journalism, see the citations in Point 3 of <a href=\"http://pastehtml.com/view/c91yw7wjy.html\">this excellent reply to Green</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.iod.com/Influencing/Press-Office/Press-releases/New-IoD-Poll-Business-leaders-delay-investment\" title=\"\">poll of members of the Institute of Directors</a> shows that business leaders think there is a low or zero chance of the economy escaping recession before the end of 2012.</p> <p>The panel, which is composed of several thousand business leaders across the country, is asked on a quarterly basis for their view of the prospects for the economy. This quarter, more than 1,000 directors took part, and the expectations of the majority (65%) are negative.</p> <p>That is worrying, not just because it may be true but because such a perspective can swiftly become self-fulfilling. A lack of economic confidence is fuelling and prolonging the current recession.</p> <p>Indeed, the poll showed 44% of respondents reported that their company had postponed investment or employment decisions so far in 2012. That means money is being saved rather than spent, and potential new jobs are not being created, because the wider economic climate is so negative. Nor is this is one-quarter blip. Well over half of those decisions are being delayed not until later in the year, but until 2013 or beyond.</p> <p>The problem is clear: a sizeable proportion of businesses do not feel able to expand in premises, technology or staff because the risks of the downturn are too great.</p> <p>Some of this will be down to international economic issues. The eurozone crisis has spooked many people \u2013 and for good reason. But that's not to say we should shrug, blame the euro entirely and do nothing. There are measures that the government can and should take to boost the morale \u2013 and the bottom-line competitiveness \u2013 of British business.</p> <p>Deficit reduction, which IoD members have strongly and consistently backed for many years, is one example. The struggle to reduce the deficit is continuing, and George Osborne is right to push ahead with it.</p> <p>But there are supply-side measures that can and should be addressed as well.</p> <p>To explore this topic, we tested IoD members' views on the effectiveness of government policies so far. Across a whole range of policy areas \u2013 from energy and transport infrastructure to tax complexity and employment regulation \u2013 the answer came back that the coalition's policies have been, on balance, ineffective.</p> <p>But measures such as simplifying the tax system or making it easier to build much-needed houses can be acted on much quicker. Despite high-profile government initiatives, according to our members the coalition is yet to make a sizeable difference.</p> <p>The fundamental lesson for George Osborne and his colleagues is that half-measures don't work, particularly when you are fighting a lack of confidence. Being bold and being radical are essential to cut through the ever-present fug of scepticism about governments in general, and to jolt people out of their current malaise about the future.</p> <p>As well as being bold, the government must resist the temptation to pretend there is one single silver bullet solution. They must attack the supply-side problem from all angles.</p> <p>So what should the agenda in front of the cabinet look like? Here are some IoD policy recommendations:</p> <p>\u2022 The government must give permission for urgently needed new airport capacity, in the south-east in particular, but possibly elsewhere as well.</p> <p>\u2022 There must be a systematic reduction of business regulation \u2013 not snipping red tapes one by one, but cutting through bundles.</p> <p>\u2022 For the Treasury to fight tax evasion at the same time as making the UK more competitive requires a drastic simplification of the tax system.</p> <p>\u2022 A proper debate \u2013 and then an actual decision \u2013 about employment law is essential, rather than the confused process of commissioning and then rubbishing the Beecroft report.</p> <p>\u2022 Progress on relaxing planning rules to allow the building of new houses, factories and infrastructure must be continued and extended.</p> <p>Radicalism is risky, but at least it brings the possibility of success \u2013 talking about radicalism but then failing to follow it up with actions is guaranteed to disappoint your supporters and frighten the nervous, without bringing any of the benefits.</p>",
  "<p>'The talented and hard-working have nothing to fear,\" says Dominic Raab, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, with just the faintest hint of menace. It is an airless, lazy day in mid-August. The House of Commons cafe is half-deserted. But Raab, firm-jawed, slightly gaunt and a rising star of the Tory right, is spending the parliamentary recess in the traditional manner of ambitious politicians: using the Westminster news vacuum to attract attention to himself and his ideas.</p> <p>Wearing jeans, the 38-year-old backbencher is talking \u2013 warily \u2013 about transforming the British workplace. He thinks current employment law offers \"excessive protections\" to workers. \"People who are coasting \u2013 it should be easier to let them go, to give the unemployed a chance. It is a delicate balancing act, but it should be decided in favour of the latter.\"</p> <p>Last Friday, a leaked fragment from a book co-written by Raab and four other Conservative MPs, Britannia Unchained: Global Lessons for Growth and Prosperity, due to be published next month, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tackle-lazy-britain-fellow-tories-tell-david-cameron-8056787.html\" title=\"\">appeared in the London Evening Standard</a>. The passage, red meat for phone-ins and columnists ever since, argued less politely for an improvement in our national work ethic: \"The British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.\"</p> <p>Further detailed revelations about the book remain forbidden by a pre-publication embargo. But having read it, I can safely say that Britannia Unchained has a brevity, pace and scope that elevates it a little above the usual pre-party-conference polemics. \"Britain is at a crossroads which will define our place in the world for generations,\" begins one of its publisher's sales pitches. \"From our economy, to our education system, to social mobility and social justice, we must learn the rules of the 21st century, or we face an inevitable slide into mediocrity.\"</p> <p>When I speak to Raab again after the Evening Standard extract, he says it gave \"a skewed and inaccurate reflection of what is in the book\". Yet over the last year he and his co-authors, all of them members of a new Conservative parliamentary faction called the <a href=\"http://www.freeenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Enterprise Group</a>, have made little secret of the harsh medicine they believe Britain needs to take. Last year, for example, Raab wrote a <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/publications/reports/q/ref-438/\" title=\"\">paper</a> for the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) \u2013 since the birth of Thatcherism one of the radical right's fiercest thinktanks \u2013 urging that \"the definition of fair dismissal should be widened ... to encompass inadequate performance ... [This] would help employers get the best from their staff.\" The paper also argued for exempting small businesses from paying the minimum wage for under-21s, the already <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/TheNationalMinimumWage/DG_10027201\" title=\"\">less-than-lavish hourly sum of between \u00a33.68 and \u00a34.98</a>.</p> <p>Raab has been an MP barely two years. Before winning a huge majority of 18,593 in one of the wealthiest seats in the country, he studied law at Oxford and Cambridge, practised in the City of London, and worked at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. He only joined the Conservative party in 2005, after the worst of its modern slump was over. Yet during our interview, it steadily becomes clearer that his confidence derives from more than this assured personal trajectory. There is also his belief that the radical right's time is coming. \"I'm a big Thatcher fan,\" he says, dropping his guard a little as the interview approaches its end. \"The coalition has done a lot of good incremental work, on the deficit and so on. Do I think we need a more decisive shift to build on what the coalition has done? The answer is a definite yes.\"</p> <p>It may come as a surprise to those who already consider the coalition a tough government, with its hairshirt rhetoric and seemingly endless spending cuts, but a growing number of Tory backbenchers, business figures, commentators and thinkers feel that the coalition \u2013 and by implication, other austerity governments across the west \u2013 is not nearly tough enough. Since 2011, as the British economy has slumped, this energetic but largely unnoticed political alliance, somewhere between a lobby group and a proper movement, has begun to show its strength.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395084848\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/22/1345651059976/Elizabeth-Truss-a-member--010.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Truss, a member of the Free Enterprise Group.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Truss, a member of the Free Enterprise Group. Photograph: Karen Robinson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since last autumn there has been the smouldering controversy about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/23/beecroft-proposals-coalition-support-criticism\" title=\"\">Beecroft Report</a>, a government-commissioned review of employment law by the powerful venture capitalist and Tory donor Adrian Beecroft. His recommendations, even more wide-ranging than Raab's \u2013 including the loosening of regulations covering the employment of children \u2013 have so far proved too contentious to be adopted by the increasingly fragile coalition. But they have become close to a sacred cause for the administration's proliferating critics in the rightwing press. Sometimes the demands for bolder government are frank: \"<a href=\"https://acs.thesundaytimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesundaytimes.co.uk%2Fsto%2Fbusiness%2FEconomy%2Farticle1036963.ece\" title=\"\">Come on Dave, be brave</a>,\" [paywall] urged the Sunday Times in May. \"A bonfire of regulation was promised, but few businesses report any relaxation in red tape.\" Sometimes the demands are more oblique: last month, a series of Daily Telegraph articles themed as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/britain-unleashed-the-future-of/\" title=\"\">\"Britain Unleashed\"</a> mixed essays on the virtues of unfettered capitalism with admiring references to other countries \u2013 usually Asian \u2013 where supposedly more red-blooded free markets operate.</p> <p>In January, the chief executive of Britain's biggest insurer Prudential, Tidjane Thiam, told the annual gathering of the global elite at Davos that across Europe, \"the minimum wage is a machine to destroy jobs.\" Speaking at the South Bank Centre in London the following week, the far-sighted BBC economics journalist and author Paul Mason interpreted Thiam's remarks as a sign of an emerging \"more radical version of neoliberalism, where we're basically, finally, told: 'The race to the bottom, to be like China, is on, and we're all going to do it. So your wages will meet the Chinese somewhere, and so will your social conditions ... abolish minimum wages, abolish social protection.\" In the audience, which had gathered to hear Mason talk about the leftwing, street-politics response to the economic crisis, not a formidable new rightwing one as well, there were a few seconds of uncomfortable silence.</p> <p>\"The European economic and welfare model \u2013 I think it's over,\" says Mark Littlewood, director of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), like the CPS a veteran British free-market thinktank reinvigorated by current possibilities. He favours cutting state spending in Britain by over a third, and leaving citizens with a \"basic safety net\". Yet he finds the coalition far too cautious. \"There has been an incredibly modest reduction in public spending. It's as if the coalition have arrived at the scene of a road accident: they've urgently applied a tourniquet to the bleeding patient, but that's it. There's no rehabilitation programme to make the patient leaner, meaner, fitter.\" In part, he blames Tory fears about their party becoming \"retoxified\": \"I've argued at the top levels of government, 'Scrap the minimum wage.' But then there's a sharp intake of breath. Anything that looks like a return to the Dickensian workhouse raises hackles. But I don't want people working in sweatshops at 5p an hour. You should sell abolishing the minimum wage in positive terms, as providing young people with a first step on the jobs ladder, as a 'jobs for all' scheme.\"</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie, editor of the influential Tory website <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>, says the coalition has placed itself in the worst of both worlds, \"talking tough but not acting tough\". Also, until late 2008, well into the financial crisis, the Tories supported increases in public spending over deficit reduction; then they abruptly reversed their position. Montgomerie argues that this opportunistic radicalism is not respected by voters, hence the government's poor poll ratings. Like Littlewood and others, he favours a more authentically bold approach, a \"rescue plan for the country\" involving much deeper spending cuts, a loosening of the planning system and reduced employee protections.</p> <p>\"It's a pretty depressing time for the Conservative party,\" says Montgomerie, \"but the thing that gives me hope is the [parliamentary] class of 2010, and all the groups they've formed. Of those groups, the Free Enterprise Group is <em>the</em> group. They're quite spiky in their opinions, but well respected by the Conservative leadership. They are George Osborne's favourites. He has spoken to them. In some ways, it helps him to have them, so he can say, 'I'm not the [government's rightwing] outrider.'\" In June, a <a href=\"http://www.exacteditions.com/read/the-spectator/23-june-2012-31697/12/3/\" title=\"\">cover story</a> on the group in the Tory house magazine the Spectator announced, \"Not since the late 1970s has there been a group of Tories thinking so hard, with such freedom, about the future of their country.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395084849\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/22/1345651169409/Priti-Patel----a-potentia-010.jpg\" alt=\"Priti Patel \u2026  a potential party leader?\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priti Patel \u2026  a potential party leader? Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Founded in October 2011, the group lists 38 supporting MPs on its website. The membership is youngish, more female and less white than the Conservative parliamentary party as a whole. It includes many of the new MPs currently identified by Tory-watchers as potential party leaders, including Raab, Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel and Elizabeth Truss. The fact that David Cameron leads a coalition rather than a Conservative administration has given the group a rare freedom to criticise government policy and suggest alternatives. Sometimes these are less fearsome than you might expect \u2013 Raab likes the French healthcare system; Truss admires the German economy \u2013 but often the foreign models cited are Asian, and the underlying message for Britons is relentless: raw capitalism is the only game in town, and you need to start working much harder. \"We can all <em>graft</em>,\" says Raab.</p> <p>The group do not expect this revolution to happen overnight. Last year, Raab and his co-authors published a predecessor to Britannia Unchained for a smaller publisher, titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/After-Coalition-Kwasi-Kwarteng/dp/1849541582\" title=\"\">After the Coalition: A Conservative Agenda for Britain</a>. \"The last 30 years of public debate in Britain has been dominated by leftwing thinking,\" the introduction rather startlingly declared, as if the transformative 18 years of the Thatcher and Major governments had never happened. On the new radical right, there is sometimes a reluctance to compare the changes envisaged for Britain to Thatcherism: partly, you suspect, because the supposed need for these changes implies that her rightwing project, to a degree, failed; and partly because she was just so divisive. \"Raab and the Free Enterprise Group are a million miles away from Norman Tebbit in the way they present their arguments,\" says Littlewood.</p> <p>Yet he and the others may have to wait longer than the next general election before implementing their vision of what you could call \"austerity max\". A Tory majority in 2015 looks increasingly unlikely, let alone one big enough to sustain a truly iconoclastic government. And would ever more radical policies really revive the party's sagging popularity? Labour leftwingers were derided in the early 80s for making exactly that argument. History proved their critics at least partly right. Also, Montgomerie acknowledges, all the coalition's austerity rhetoric since 2010 means that \"Toughness is a harder sell now [for the Tory radicals]. The government has already played the 'tough' card.\"</p> <p>Public opinion has turned flintier in recent years on welfare spending. But such a mood swing often occurs at the end of Labour administrations and the beginning of Conservative ones, and often reverses, into distaste at an \"uncaring\" government, once the British right has been in power for a few years. The popular mandate for the coalition's broader spending cuts, if it ever truly existed, has already crumbled. And on tax and capitalism in general, public opinion is, if anything, moving leftwards, as tax cheats and feckless bankers solidify into popular demons. Littlewood admits, \"There isn't yet a readiness from the British public to say, 'We've got to go back to the [rightwing] drawing board.'\"</p> <p>In radical right circles, it is strikingly common to hear comparisons between Cameron's government and that of his Tory predecessor Edward Heath: narrowly elected in 1970, briefly tough before a chaos of U-turns, replaced in 1974 by an often equally beleaguered Labour administration \u2013 before the right's big moment finally arrived in 1979, with Thatcher's election. If history repeats, which it rarely does exactly, we should expect the Unchaining of Britannia to commence in 2019.</p> <p>In the meantime, after half a decade, already, of widespread pay freezes and anxiety, and with Labour under Ed Miliband quietly accepting that they will next hold power in hard times too \u2013 \"There is a new world out there,\" the much-tipped young Labour backbencher Stella Creasy recently told this paper, \"in the next [government] spending review absolutely everything should be on the table\" \u2013 the toughening-up of Britain is arguably well underway.</p> <p>Are we a nation of idlers? I'm not sure we were completely complacent even during the fat years of the 90s. Here is Tony Blair at the 1999 Labour conference: \"All around us the challenge of change ... technological revolution ... global finance and communications ... These forces ... wait for no one and no nation.\" Perhaps it is the fate of all old nations to be told to pull their socks up by politicians.</p>",

  "<p>Palestinian leaders have accused Israel of interfering in internal Palestinian affairs and launching \"a deliberate campaign of distortion, hatred and incitement\", after the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called for elections to replace the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.</p> <p>In a letter to EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, and other members of the Middle East quartet, Lieberman accuses Abbas of heading \"a despotic government riddled with corruption\" and \"personally acting to undermine attempts to renew the peace process, despite Israeli gestures and confidence building measures.\"</p> <p>Lieberman accuses Abbas of having a \"weak standing\" among his own people and being \"uninterested or unable \u2026 to reach an agreement which would bring an end to the conflict\".</p> <p>\"General elections in the PA [Palestinian Authority] should be held, and a new, legitimate, hopefully realistic Palestinian leadership should be elected,\" Lieberman writes.</p> <p>The letter, dated 20 August, was published on Wednesday by the Israeli daily Haaretz, sparking a storm of protest from Palestinian officials.</p> <p>Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh described the text as \"incitement\" liable to create an \"atmosphere of violence and instability\".</p> <p>\"Lieberman's comments regarding elections in the PA constitute meddling in internal Palestinian affairs,\" he added.</p> <p>Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the PLO, which handles diplomatic contacts with Israel, said the letter demonstrated Israel's \"arrogance, manipulation of facts, and outright racism. Rather than complying with international law and signed agreements, the Israeli government has launched a deliberate campaign of distortion, hatred and incitement.\"</p> <p>Israel has complained previously about Abbas's refusal to restart peace talks over the continued expansion of Israeli settlements, but he has always been described as a potential peace partner.</p> <p>Officials representing Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly distanced him from his foreign minister's remarks. An aide to Netanyahu told the Guardian that the prime minister was not aware of the letter before it was sent.</p> <p>\"The letter by the foreign minister does not reflect the view of the prime minister, nor of the government as a whole,\" said the official. \"Palestinian president Abbas has created difficulties preventing the restarting of negotiations, but Israel nevertheless remains committed to continuing to try to engage with the Palestinians and of course we don't interfere in the election cycles of others.\"</p> <p>Observers of Israel's byzantine coalition politics said it was possible that the letter was released for internal political purposes, to boost the government's rightwing credentials and domestic popularity ahead of an imminent general election.</p> <p>\"This letter was not written overnight,\" said Gerald Steinberg, professor of politics at Bar-Ilan University. \"The letter says very explicitly what Lieberman has been saying to Israeli audiences, and what many Israelis believe. Lieberman has often played the role of saying things that Netanyahu may think but as prime minister is reluctant to say.\"</p> <p>But Steinberg also recalled that differences between prime ministers and foreign ministers are a long-standing Israeli tradition.</p> <p>\"This is very much part of Israel's political system,\" he said. \"The most blatant example was when Shimon Peres as foreign minister promoted the Oslo peace process behind the back of the prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin.\"</p>",

  "<p>Thousands of South African gold miners are attempting to launch a multi-million pound lawsuit against leading companies for alleged negligence that resulted in them contracting lung diseases.</p> <p>Lawyers say AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields and Harmony could face record damages if the court recognises their case as a class action.</p> <p>Charles Abrahams, a lawyer representing around 3,000 mostly former miners, filed papers at a regional court in Johannesburg on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"If the certification is granted we anticipate that this may be the largest damages suit in the history of this country, in the tens of billions of rand possibly,\" he said.</p> <p>Although no national figures exist, Abrahams extrapolates from a number of local studies that between 350,000 and 500,000 gold miners have contracted lung diseases such as silicosis and tuberculosis in South Africa in recent decades.</p> <p>\"All the studies, in broad terms, point to an absolute epidemic that has not received the attention either of the organised industry or government,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If the research is correct, you can just imagine the scale of the damages that each would be entitled to claim. Loss of past earnings, loss of future earnings, medical treatment et cetera.\"</p> <p>Silicosis is a disease with no known cure that causes shortness of breath, a persistent cough and chest pains. It also makes sufferers highly susceptible to tuberculosis.</p> <p>The lawsuit, which has little precedent in South African law, has its roots in a landmark ruling by the constitutional court a year ago that allowed miners with lung disease to sue their employers for damages for the first time.</p> <p>Abrahams began a presentation to media in Johannesburg by reading from George Orwell's essay <a href=\"http://orwell.ru/library/essays/mine/english/e_dtm\" title=\"\">Down the Mine</a>, describing the grim conditions endured by miners in 1930s Britain. He was joined by a group of miners who sang and stood in silence in memory of victims of last week's Marikana platinum mine massacre.</p> <p>Abrahams said the claim was separate but similar to that of fellow lawyer Richard Spoor, who represents about 14,000 claimants. The two cases could eventually be merged, he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for AngloGold Ashanti said: \"AngloGold Ashanti is currently reviewing the claim instituted by Charles Abrahams in South Africa's South Gauteng court today and will respond through the appropriate court procedures.</p> <p>\"Where occupational lung disease is concerned, we are focused on continually improving the health and safety of our employees and have been working to improve the management of dust underground and to reduce exposure so as to prevent incidences of silicosis. A healthier, safer workforce is central to our business ethos.</p> <p>\"While progress has been made, we recognise that silicosis-related compensation must be reviewed to address inadequacies in the system as previously identified by the constitutional court.\"</p> <p>Graham Briggs, the chief executive of Harmony, told Reuters earlier this year that the issue of silicosis was a big topic but he did not think it \"class action material\".</p> <p>Different conditions prevailed at different times in different mines, he said, and workers may have had more than one employer.</p> <p>A successful suit could collectively cost mining companies billions of dollars, according to legal and industry experts. The biggest settlement to date by the mining industry in South Africa was $100m (\u00a363.3m) in a 2003 case brought by Spoor against an asbestos company.</p> <p>In a separate court case, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/18/anglo-american-sued-miner-tuberculosis\" title=\"\">more than 1,200 former miners are suing Anglo American</a>, which denies any liability for allegedly failing to provide protection from dangerous levels of dust created by deep-level gold mining between the 1960s and 1990s.</p>",
  "<p>The death toll in the West Nile outbreak has reached 41, officials said on Wednesday, as the city of Houston said it would begin aerial spraying to combat the virus.</p> <p>America's fourth-biggest city said it would scatter insecticide from planes over a 63,000-acre area northwest of downtown after two more deaths took the local total to three this year.</p> <p>Texas is the epicenter of the country's worst West Nile outbreak of 2012, with the bulk of cases in the north. Dallas County, 240 miles north of Houston, has tracked 270 human infections, and the reported death toll in the Dallas-Fort Worth region is 18. Only two fatalities were recorded in Texas last year by the Texas department of state health services.</p> <p>A warm winter and ample spring rainfall have been blamed for the sharp rise. About half of all infections in the US this year are in Texas, but according to the Centers for Disease Control, West Nile is present in 47 states. </p> <p>An elderly woman died from the disease in Fresno, California, Fresno County, officials said Tuesday. Six people have died in Louisiana this year. Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Dakota and Oklahoma account for 75% of the cases.</p> <p>\"We're in the midst of one of the largest West Nile outbreaks ever seen in the United States,\" Dr Lyle Petersen of the CDC told the Associated Press.</p> <p>The CDC on Wednesday released figures that showed 1,118 known human cases of West Nile, including 41 deaths \u2013 a rise of 425 cases in a week and the highest number ever recorded in the US at this time of year. The true numbers are likely to be higher, since cases emerge at local and state level before coming to the federal agency's attention.</p> <p>Some areas of Dallas have been treated twice by aerial spraying since last week, and in total more than 360,000 acres were doused. \"The initial result is showing is that aerial spraying is working, with no visible side effects. We believe it was the right tactic,\" Mayor Mike Rawlings told the Dallas Morning News. He declared a state of emergency last week.</p> <p>CDC officials are analyzing data to determine how effectively the spray has reduced the mosquito population before Dallas decides whether to spray from the sky for a third time. Other cities in north Texas will use aerial spraying Wednesday night and Thursday but some have opted out.</p> <p>While Houston has used the tactic each year since 2002, Dallas had not sprayed pesticide from planes since 1966, and many residents were opposed to the tactic, fearing that the risk from the poison is greater than the danger of contracting West Nile.</p> <p>The pesticide, Duet, is a combination of synthetic pyrethroids that is approved by the Environmental Protection Agency but is harmful to beneficial insects such as honey bees, and not risk-free for humans if mishandled.</p> <p>EPA guidelines state: \"Pyrethroids can be used for public health mosquito control programs without posing unreasonable risks to human health when applied according to the label. Pyrethroids are considered to pose slight risks of acute toxicity to humans, but at high doses, pyrethroids can affect the nervous system.\"</p> <p>Vanessa van Gilder, a Dallas resident and beekeeper, organized a petition against spraying that has attracted more than 2,000 signatures. \"Truck spraying will continue \u2026 I find that very disturbing,\" she told the Guardian. </p> <p>\"Adulticide with that non-targeted approach is not effective. Larvicide is the way to go \u2013 men on the ground with adulticide in hand spraying specific areas such as storm drains. At night, mosquitoes might not be out and can hide.\"<br>She was skeptical about the Mayor's claims of success. \"I've seen reports saying that mosquitoes are at the end of their natural life cycle and that's why some have died,\" she said.</p> <p>West Nile was discovered in the US in 1999. It typically peaks between mid-August and early September and is thought to be transmitted when mosquitoes bite infected birds, then people. Most humans who are infected do not become unwell, but around one in five develop flu-like symptoms and fewer than 1% of victims may suffer neurological complications that can lead to brain damage and death. Older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.</p> <p>Health experts advise taking precautions to reduce the chances of being bitten by mosquitoes, such as using repellent from dawn to dusk, wearing long sleeves and pants and draining standing water around properties.</p> <p>Houston is employing Dibrom, also known as Naled, an organophosphate first registered in the US in 1959 that is also used on crops. It can cause severe health problems at extremely high dosages, but the EPA considers it safe for the general population when used correctly for mosquito control. Houston authorities recommend that anyone concerned about exposure stay indoors during aerial spraying, which is scheduled for 8.30pm local time.</p> <p>\"In terms of a knockdown for mosquito populations [Naled] doesn't have any parallels,\" said Joe Conlon, technical advisor for the American Mosquito Control Association. He said that studies have shown the health risks of aerial spraying paled in comparison with the danger posed by West Nile. \"The fact is it works, and that's why people do it,\" he said.</p> <p>Conlon added that the virus's impact this summer should be a wake-up call to the authorities and ordinary Americans after several relatively quiet years: \"This will tell us that it's not going away and in the right conditions it'll present itself in a large scale outbreak.\"</p> <p>He believes it is inevitable that more mosquito-borne diseases will spread to the United States from other continents. \"This is the first of many,\" he said. \"Rift Valley fever, Chikungunya \u2026 the nastiest vector-borne diseases on the planet are an eight-hour plane ride away.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Tories are coming under increasing pressure to return \u00a3440,000 in donations from the company owned by the fraudster Asil Nadir, following his conviction for stealing tens of millions of pounds.</p> <p>Party officials appeared to reject the demands on Wednesday when they said the donations had been received \"in good faith\" from the firm Polly Peck and that officials would study the court's judgment before deciding how to proceed.</p> <p>The tone of the Conservatives' statement was in marked contrast to a promise given in 1993 by Sir Norman Fowler, then party chairman, who said that the money would clearly be returned if it was proved it had been stolen.</p> <p>On Wednesday, a Conservative spokesperson said the party would study the court's judgment but declined to confirm that they would repay the cash if it was stolen property.</p> <p>\"The Conservative party has no record of having received donations from Asil Nadir.

He was cleared of three charges.</p> <p>Polly Peck International, once a large UK company, collapsed in 1990 after a Serious Fraud Office investigation.</p> <p>Via his companies, Nadir is thought to have been one of the Conservative party's biggest benefactors under Margaret Thatcher, a period in which party donations did not have to be publicly declared.</p> <p>Accountants investigating Polly Peck found that a subsidiary had made a series of donations to the Conservative party between 1985 and 1990, seemingly without the knowledge of the company's board or shareholders.</p> <p>Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck, wrote a letter \u2013 widely reported four years ago \u2013 to the party's central office claiming that \u00a3365,000 came from money defrauded from the Polly Peck empire.</p> <p>\"It is the contention of the administrator that Mr Nadir is liable to repay the sums concerned as a result of his fraud and/or breach of fiduciary duty and/or malfeasance as a director,\" the letter concluded. \"I would urge you to return the donations to Polly Peck so that the creditors can at least obtain some small measure of compensation from this unfortunate affair.\"</p> <p>The nine donations \u2013 three from Polly Peck International, of \u00a325,000 each, and six from a subsidiary, Unipac Packaging Ltd, of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 \u2013 were paid into the Conservative Industrial Fund, according to reports, and spanned the period from October 1985 to March 1990.</p> <p>An investigation into the affair by parliament in 1993 led to Fowler (now Lord Fowler) telling the home affairs select committee that the money would be returned should it emerge it had been stolen from shareholders.</p> <p>Fowler said: \"If it is proved that that money was stolen, then clearly that money will be returned. We have absolutely no intention of keeping money of that kind.\"</p> <p>But he added it would be for lawyers to decide whether the money had been stolen. He defended the acceptance of the money, pointing out that Polly Peck had been a reputable company in the late 1980s and it was not possible to check the bona fides of each donor.</p> <p>It also emerged during the select committee inquiry that the sums did not appear in the company's accounts.</p> <p>Sir John Major, prime minister at the time, had echoed Fowler's comments. \"If it proves to have been dishonestly obtained and dishonestly remitted to us then of course we will return it,\" he told parliament.</p> <p>The close relationship between the government of Thatcher and Nadir ended in the autumn of 1990. She was ousted from No 10 and Nadir was being chased by police, creditors and irate investors.</p> <p>Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, was forced to resign from Major's government after it was discovered that he had given Nadir a watch inscribed \"Don't let the buggers get you down\" just before the latter fled prior to his trial in 1993.</p> <p>The Conservative party's latest statement echoes comments made by Liberal Democrats after a court ruled that a \u00a32.4m donation received from the convicted fraudster Michael Brown had been stolen.</p> <p>After Brown was returned to a British jail in April, Nick Clegg told the BBC that the party would not be returning the cash or be seeking to compensate Brown's many victims.</p> <p>Clegg said: \"The money was received in good faith and all the controls, all the checks that should have been made were reasonably made by the Liberal Democrats at the time.\"</p> <p>The Tories have, until now, gleefully taunted the Liberal Democrats over their decision to keep stolen money.</p> <p>Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said the Tories had to honour the promises of Fowler and Major. \"Even John Major's government, which was mired in sleaze, knew they'd have to give back Asil Nadir's money if he was found guilty.</p> <p>\"David Cameron must honour the unequivocal promises the Conservatives have made to repay the \u00a3440,000 they accepted from Nadir. If he doesn't, it will show the Tory party aren't serious when they claim they want to clean up politics.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/\" title=\"\">Forbes magazine's annual list of the 100 most powerful women on the planet</a> is long on politicians, philanthropists and entertainers, but short on influential Britons, with just the Queen and JK Rowling making this year's cut.</p> <p>Leading the list for the second year running is the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, followed by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, and Melinda Gates, co-chair of the foundation that bears her name and that of her husband, Bill.</p> <p>The magazine \u2013 which refers to Merkel as the \"'Iron Lady' of Europe and the lead player in the eurozone economic drama that continues to threaten global markets\" \u2014 notes her embracing of the internet, green credentials and high public approval ratings in the run-up to next year's general election.</p> <p>Clinton, meanwhile is praised for her commitment to her job \u2013 \"this year alone she's travelled to 42 countries\" \u2013 her handling of the WikiLeaks cable crisis, and her uncompromising attitude.</p> <p>\"In November, [Clinton] urged Syrian President Bashar Assad to hand over his power and leave his country, and recently warned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to chart a different course than his militant father,\" says Forbes. The magazine said supporters were still hopeful of Clinton making a presidential bid, despite her stated determination to move out of public life at the end of the year.</p> <p>Rousseff earns her place for her ambitious plans and programmes \"aimed at eradicating dire poverty and increasing access to education, medical care and sanitation services to those in need by 2014\". The politician, whose popularity stood at 77% two months ago, tells the magazine: \"What I want my legacy to be is this country to be increasing middle class, to be highly competitive and highly educated.\"</p> <p>Next up is Gates, who has used her money and influence to challenge the Vatican over its position on birth control.</p> <p>The first lady of the US comes in seventh place on the list, below Jill Abramson, executive editor of the New York Times, and Sonia Gandhi, the longest serving president of the Indian National Congress party.</p> <p>\"More popular than her husband in this important election year, Michelle Obama's positive approval ratings register at 66%,\" says Forbes. \"The first lady keeps a high profile with her mission to end childhood obesity, her commitment to military families and her stylish fashion picks.\"</p> <p>Hovering just outside the top 10 \u2013 whose remaining spots are claimed by Christine Lagarde of the IMF, the US homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, and Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook \u2013 is \"the Queen of Media\" Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>She is far from the only cultural force to find Forbes recognition: Winfrey's friend Lady Gaga occupies 14th spot, a tribute to both her $52m earnings last year and her philanthropic work.</p> <p>Beyonce Knowles, \"actress, entrepreneur, musician\", is 18 places behind Gaga, but six places ahead of Jennifer L\u00f3pez and eight ahead of the Colombian singer-songwriter and philanthropist Shakira.</p> <p>The Queen is at No 26. \"She has been commemorating her 60th diamond Jubilee anniversary with parades, parties and by making peace throughout the realm,\" notes Forbes. \"In June she shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness during a visit to Northern Ireland that was seen as a symbol of significant easing of tensions in British-Irish relations. In lighter but similarly symbolic news the iconic clock tower of Britain's parliament building \u2013 widely, though incorrectly called Big Ben \u2013 was renamed in her honour this summer. It will be known as Elizabeth Tower.\"</p> <p>In the final quarter of the list, occupying 78th spot, is JK Rowling, soon to publish her \"first adult offering, a dark comedy titled The Casual Vacancy\". The billionaire author, says Forbes, shrewdly held onto the e-book rights of her Harry Potter novels, finally publishing them through the online Pottermore store this year.</p> <p>American-born Dame Marjorie Scardino, who runs Financial Times publisher Pearson, and who has British citizenship, is in the list at 86.</p> <p>Moira Forbes, president and publisher of ForbesWoman, said: \"These power women exert influence in very different ways and to very different ends, and all with very different impacts on the global community.</p> <p>\"So many of these women are in policy or political roles, and their influence ... is only growing so it's not surprising that someone like Merkel or Clinton would continue to be present on the list year to year.\"</p>",
  "<p>How does one go about defining a powerful woman? Forbes has an annual bash at it with its World's 100 Most Powerful Women list, the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2012/08/22/the-worlds-100-most-powerful-women-2012-this-year-its-all-about-impact/\" title=\"\">latest of which is published today</a>. The results are often a mixed bag hinting at mysterious assessment criteria. The Queen, for example, is a mainstay, despite wielding little constitutional or legislative power, while Anna Wintour, the one woman who is personally responsible for deciding which clothes we all put on in the morning, arguably has a much wider scope of influence, but no title. Angela Merkel, meanwhile, makes important economic decisions and we give little thought to her outfit choices, unlike Lady Gaga, whose influence has so permeated popular culture that she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2012/aug/09/lady-gaga-pos-louise-mensch\" title=\"\">has her own social network</a> and has beaten Aung San Suu Kyi. Louise Mensch, meanwhile, also has her own social network, but does not appear anywhere on the list, although by next year she may have \"broken America\" and, despite having forgone political power, might be well on her way to setting up a new world order (I'm already building a bunker in the garden).</p> <p>What all this listing and categorising seems to imply is that there is no one way of defining power. One needn't even be alive. If we're defining it in terms of influence, the Virgin Mary would be a strong contender. Forbes sticks to the here and now. Some women on the list are opinion formers (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/07/jill-abramson-editor-new-york-times\" title=\"\">Jill Abramson</a>, Arianna Huffington), while others hold political office (Hillary Clinton), or are married to those that do (Michelle Obama). Many on the list have fought their way to the top of male-dominated arenas, such as finance, further complicating matters because most people have no idea who they are. So, while some women seem to be on the list due to the premise that public profile and visibility constitute power, others are unseen puppeteers, pulling the strings behind the scenes.</p> <p>All this talk of power is fittingly capitalistic, of course. You could say that the power many of these women yield lies in their ability to get you and me to buy stuff, often by blending seamlessly into power structures created by men, much to the chagrin of second wave feminists. What were the shoulder pads and masculine tailoring of the 80s if not sartorial attempts to \"man up\"? Germaine Greer is oft quoted (at least by me) as having said, \"I wanted to liberate women from the vacuum cleaner, not get them on the board of Hoover.\" The feminists of the 1970s wanted a revolution, but instead they got Facebook and Oprah. And yet, telling women that they wield the \"wrong kind\" of power not only rudely undermines all the hard work they've undergone in order to claw their way to the top, but also raises yet more complicated questions, such as what exactly do you want from us, goddammit?</p> <p>I once asked someone who worked in the City why there weren't more women on the boards of Fortune 500 companies. His answer, put simply, was that in order to wield power, one must be something of an arsehole. There are fewer women arseholes, he continued, than there are male, hence the power imbalance. This theory will inevitably anger many people below the line, and though I am not condoning it, it may go some way to explaining why successful women are characterised as ruthless, power-hungry and ambitious to a fault. Perhaps, like their male counterparts, they are. Perhaps they have to be. It would be unfair to speculate too much in this regard as not one of them has ever asked me out for a drink, and is unlikely to. They might be perfectly lovely human beings.</p> <p>Another fluffy definition of power could be that it belongs to those who precipitate genuine (and hopefully positive) social change. This is problematic considering that many on the list steadfastly maintain the status quo. Those who wish to overhaul the system are unlikely to be granted accolades by the system, however influential they may be. The common factor these women share is not a desire for change, but, somewhat fittingly for Forbes, money. Money: the ability to earn it, control it (sometimes philanthropically, often not), manipulate it, and influence how others spend it. Quite simple, really.</p> <p>You or I might have very different definitions of power. We could see it as the ability to stand up to dissenters and deliver our viewpoints with clarity, bravery and authority. As having a voice in the face of life-threatening terror. Those who hold this kind of power are often lacking it in the more traditional, political sense (Aung San Suu Kyi, an exception, has achieved both). It's what Zen Buddhists might call \"inner strength\", and it is something you can hold without having status, or large earnings, or even influence. It does not corrupt, but neither does it turn a profit, hence the absence of a list. Perhaps we need to make one.</p>",

The <em>New York Times</em> photographer was born in Connecticut and started photographing for newspapers in 1996, having had no professional training. In 2000 she first travelled to Afghanistan to document Taliban oppression, and has since recorded conflicts in Iraq, Darfur, Lebanon, Libya and Congo. During the civil war in Libya last year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/mar/23/new-york-times-journalist-safety?INTCMP=SRCH\">she was captured</a> by forces loyal to Ghaddafi and held for six days, while her colleague <a href=\"http://cpj.org/killed/2011/mohamed-shaglouf.php\">Mohammed Shaglouf</a>, was killed.</p> <p><em>Veiled Rebellion</em> is the title of her exhibition showing the lives of women in Afghanistan, which opened at Newcastle's <a href=\"http://www.amber-online.com/sections/side-gallery\">Side Gallery</a> at the weekend. She visited Afghanistan three times before the fall of the Taliban, and has been back virtually every year since. In 2009 National Geographic magazine commissioned Addario to create a comprehensive photo-essay showing many facets of women's lives in Afghanistan. <em>Veiled Rebellion</em> is the result of that assignment. And it was not just Afghan women that she pictured \u2013 there are several shots of the US Marine's \"Female Engagement Team\".</p> <p>A few images show the beauty of the countryside set against the difficulties with which the Afghans struggle. In one picture (above) two women covered from head to toe in blue burqas stand on a roadside with a backdrop of the Hindu Kush mountains. It's a beautiful image, but the back story is that 20 year old Noor Nisa, with her mother, was being taken to the maternity clinic four hours drive away when her husband's car broke down. Noor Nisa's waters had broken, and her husband, who had lost his first wife in childbirth, had gone to find another vehicle. Lynsey and her driver eventually gave Noor Nisa and her mother a lift to the hospital, where she gave birth to a baby girl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395057549\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345644851603/Lynsey_Adarrio_Presidential_election_rally_Kabul_Sports_stadium_2009.jpg\" alt=\"burqa Afghanistan Lynsey Addario\" width=\"448\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lynsey Addario, Veiled rebellion.

Bibi Aisha was married by 14 to a vicious man, believed to be a Taliban fighter. To punish her when she tried to escape and was taken back to him he, with the help of several other men, cut off her nose, ears and hair. In another picture we see Shamsia Jafari, a 17 year old with a badly scarred face caused by Taliban sympathisers spraying her, and 11 other pupils at the Mirwais School for Girls in Kandahar, with acid. Almost all the girls returned to their classes, and the school is trying to raise money to buy a school bus to give them greater protection.</p> <p>One of the stranger shots was taken by the journalist with her camera inside a burqa, so we see the partially obscured and partially shaded streets of Kandahar as they would be seen by a woman wearing one. </p> <p>The undercurrent of oppression is sometimes all too visible \u2013 in one shot we see actress Trena Amiri driving her car around Kabul, with her arms, hair and face uncovered; in the background, through her car window, we see the hostile face of a man staring angrily at her. According to Addario: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even in relatively progressive Kabul, men and women glare, honk and scream at her. It provokes men in Afghanistan to see strong women. It symbolizes a freedom they just aren't comfortable with.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395057550\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345644973747/Lynsey_addario_Veiled_Rebellion__Afghan_policewomen_handle_AMD65_rifles_at_a_firing_range_utside_Kabul.jpg\" alt=\"Burqa Afghan policewomen Lynsey Addario\" width=\"448\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lynsey Addario, Veiled Rebellion.

There are also some very happy and positve scenes. In a pleasant looking park just outside Bamyan a jolly group of trainee teachers enjoy a picnic of lamb, flat bread and Pepsi. In another shot we see three Afghan policewomen firing their AMD-65 rifles at a firing range. Apparently there are only 700 female police officers among the 100,000 Afghan police force. In another we see heavily veiled women in a beautiful 1000 year old shrine in Herat. One day a week, a section of the shrine is partitioned off so women can come to pray. As Addario says: </p> <blockquote> <p>Cordoned off to create a sanctuary for women, these prayer sections seem to me like some of the safest, most intimate places in the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Veiled Rebellion, by Lynsey Addario, can be seen at Side Gallery, Newcastle, until October 13th.

In Bosnia, the fires are complicated by the fact they have swept through minefields from the Bosnian war, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/balkans-heat-wave-fuels-forest-fires-bosnia-17051965\" title=\"\">causing explosions in forest areas</a>.</p> <p>Is it a coincidence that some of the fires are in countries badly hit by the financial crisis?

In Britain, a Home Office report found around half of all arsonists are men under 18, and classified about 80% of cases as being motivated by vandalism, boredom and thrill-seeking. <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/INFD-7RZH6B\" title=\"\">Researchers studying wild fires in South Wales</a> found that impoverished areas were more likely to suffer wild fires: the 20% most deprived areas in South Wales are nine times more likely to experience wild fires than the least deprived areas.</p>",
  "<p>I'm nearly twice as old now as I was when I sat my GCSE exams, although I'm reliably informed that I look much older than that. When my friend (comedian<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jonnie.price.9\"> Jonnie Price</a>) found out I was only 30, his immediate response was 'F**k me, what happened to you?' But regardless, I remember my school exams very well.</p> <p>I didn't go to a particularly reputable school. It was your standard over-subscribed under-funded school in an economically depressed area. One time our headmaster explained that there was a new electronics factory setting up in the local area. This factory would compete with the other electronics factory already established in the area. The new factory would be likely to poach all the top employees from the old factory, he said. The old factory would then have to promote people from the factory floor to fill the vacancies. This would leave a lot of factory floor jobs up for grabs. And if we worked hard and applied ourselves, <em> we could fill those entry level vacancies!</em></p> <p>This was genuinely meant as a motivational talk; if we did our best, we could maybe get jobs pressing buttons in a factory. Nothing wrong with such jobs of course, they're necessary and honest work, but they're rarely the subject of \"reach for the stars\"-style speeches. Except in my school.</p> <p>Long story short, I was in the minority for having educational aspirations. For example, in 1998, in my school of over a thousand pupils, if you added up the A-level physics, chemistry and biology classes, you got seven students. Three of them were me. </p> <p>Infinite respect to the teaching staff, they generally did the very best they could with limited resources and in trying circumstances, but passing GCSEs and other exams with decent marks was a considerable effort for me and the others whose ambitions required this. But even so, a number of us got through with respectable grades.</p> <p>Turns out we needn't have bothered, because as numerous politicians pointed out once the national results were released, <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6027579\">exams were getting easier</a>. All that effort was pointless; we could have just glanced at our notes on the way in, scribbled down what we could remember along with some rudimentary guesswork and got a pass. No sweat.</p> <p>I remember this claim quite vividly. I was quite livid about it. I know I was a male adolescent so you might think this was my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/mar/03/1\">default mental state</a>, but I wasn't an aggressive teen. All of my hormones were seemingly used up in producing <a href=\"http://acne.about.com/od/teensacne/a/teenbasics.htm\">acne.</a> But whatever your mental state, having spent months working for something and actually achieving it, only to have some random political or media dullard dismiss it outright, it's difficult to not take that personally. </p> <p>It's GCSE results week. Results this year are not expected to change vastly compared with last year, with the percentage of A to C grades predicted to remain roughly constant (although by the time you read this blog, that prediction could be proven wildly inaccurate). Whatever happens, the proportion of students achieving the higher grades will be much higher than when the exams <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/gcses\">were first introduced</a>, and odds are it'll be too tempting to resist for some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jun/21/michael-gove-scrap-gcse-exams\">crusty old politician hoping to make political capital from trotting out the old \"exams are getting easier\" claim.</a></p> <p>Maybe exams are quantifiably easier than they used to be (but even this is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10094248\">debatable</a>). But, some may argue, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14661746\">more and more students are getting higher grades,</a> so obviously they must be. What other explanation could there be?</p> <p>There are several, actually. Is it not possible that today's children are <br>actually getting smarter? This may seem like a sweeping generalisation, but then so is the claim that \"exams are getting easier\". But check out the bizarre <a href=\"http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/flynneffect.shtml\">Flynn effect</a>, which shows that each generation is quantifiably smarter than the last, regardless of country or upbringing. </p> <p>There may be alternative explanations for this. Perhaps the incredibly detailed and constantly updated intelligence tests used<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient\"> to calculate IQ</a> are getting easier too? But today's youth have access to more information at the<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/study-as-more-teens-own-smartphones-less-are-actually-using-it-to-make-calls/\"> touch of a button</a> than previous generations had at even the most well-stocked libraries, so is it that ridiculous to assume they might know more stuff as a result? </p> <p>Alarmists argue (without much evidence) that this is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/8825655/Video-games-can-alter-childrens-brains.html\">damaging the youth of today</a>. I <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100111114/guest-post-baroness-greenfield-junk-neuroscience-and-the-danger-of-video-games/\">disagree</a>.</p> <p>Maybe the context is different? Exams didn't mean so much in the years of O-levels. My father often likes to say: \"I worked hard in school. What a Thursday that was\". He exaggerates, but he didn't get on with education. Didn't matter, he still managed to go on and do well, and end up with a son who is a prematurely aged science nerd. But in previous decades, university was more of a luxury <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7191924/University-admissions-Labours-student-drive-that-backfired.html\">than an apparent necessity</a>. And with more people in university than ever (well, until<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/09/tuition-fees-increase-15000-less-applicants\"> now</a> maybe) and a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/08/21/young-people-job-hunting-postcode-lottery_n_1815797.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\">borderline-apocalyptic job market</a>, getting a degree is less an indulgence and more of a necessity in many cases. When your long-term survival is at stake, this should motivate you to do well in exams.</p> <p>Or maybe exams really are relatively easier. Maybe <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/too-many-exams-are-ruining--childrens-enjoyment-of-learning-6284217.html\">successive</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/aug/11/politics.schools\">governments</a> who prioritise exam results over actual learning, like an angler who thinks catching a fish is less important than weighing the damn thing, have caused a gradual decrease in exam difficulty by an increasingly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/2011/oct/03/government-interference\">put-upon educational establishment</a>.</p> <p>I don't know which of these possibilities is most likely to be the main contributing factor, if any. I do know, however, that whatever reason you favour, the ones who are not to blame are the ones sitting the exams; the students themselves.</p> <p>The whole \"exams are getting easier\" bandwagon that starts rolling whenever exam results are announced is inherently toxic. Students who do well in their exams get their achievements metaphorically pissed on in the national press. Those who fail, and there are still plenty of students who do, are made to feel much worse about this. It is lucky teenagers are so emotionally stable and reasonable, or this may have some negative consequences.</p> <p>And that's one thing that is never considered in the rush to pass sweeping judgements on exam results. Even if exams are easier, this is a purely relative measure. Today's GCSE students have never sat an O-level exam, they never will. They have no idea how easy or hard they were, they weren't even taught the same material. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1558702\">Their psychosocial context</a> is completely different. To them, the exams they sit are still the most difficult assessment they have ever faced, and they are reminded of how important exams are with alarming frequency. And of course, <a href=\"http://128.95.226.115/research/sarason/files/ReactionsToTests.pdf\">stress impacts on test performance</a>. </p> <p>The structure of some long obsolete tests should be of no consequence, not used as a stick to beat them with for actually doing what is asked of them.</p> <p>If someone does something and you <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/operantconditioning/f/punishment.htm\">punish</a> them for their actions, they are unlikely to do it again. That's a well-established principle of associative learning. Rats can learn this <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14640747908400743\">extremely quickly</a>, and teenagers, whatever you think of them, are much smarter than rats. If, during the period in your life when you're distrustful of authority down <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16535-why-teenagers-cant-see-your-point-of-view.html\">to a biological level</a>, you are told your success is dependent on educational achievement thanks to the mess those in charge have made of society, and then those same people tell you that your success is actually a fluke due to circumstances you have no say in, then that is probably going to cause some resentment.</p> <p>And politicians constantly wonder why today's youth are so <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8546366.stm\">disengaged with politics</a>? Maybe it's because their first experience with politics involves being screwed over for the sake of scoring a few media points? A valuable life lesson, you may argue, but that doesn't make it right. </p> <p>Despite what politicians and the media may think, teenagers aren't completely self-obsessed passive automatons, only communicating with the outside world via text speak or happy slapping. They are aware of what's being said of them, even if it's by proxy. We're in the world of 24 hours news and the internet in your pocket, and they have every right to be pissed off. It's often said that today's youth have \"no respect\", but then they don't seem to receive any, so why would they?</p> <p>And to any GCSE or A-level students reading this: well done. Whatever your results, well done. You've achieved a lot, while those who would claim to be your superiors are screwing things up<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ed-miliband-admits-labours-mistakes-on-entry-rules-7873595.html\"> left</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191460/Britains-borrowing-soars-reeling-Osborne-plots-radical-spending-cuts.html\">right</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atfNL0_KAcs\">centre</a>. And if you see anyone running you down, it's probably because they're insecure about what you've achieved, and are lashing out as a result. Having a massive rant in a mainstream media publication is how people over 30 work out their issues.</p> <p>Kudos to you all.<br> <em>Dean Burnett tries to be \"down with the kids\" via his twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a><br></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 August 2012.

  "<p>The leading clubs in the Aviva Premiership in England and Top 14 in France are ready to organise an alternative tournament to the Heineken Cup because they feel European rugby's premier club competition is weighted too heavily in favour of the Celtic nations.</p> <p>Leinster and Munster have dominated the Heineken Cup in recent years, winning the trophy between them in five of the last seven seasons with Leinster champions three times in the last four tournaments.</p> <p>Rivals in England and France believe the success of the Irish sides is largely because they are able to rest players regularly during the RaboDirect Pro 12 campaign as qualification for the following season's Heineken Cup is a virtual formality, something that is not the case in the Aviva Premiership and Top 14.</p> <p>\"Most of the Ireland squad will not be released for the Pro 12 until rounds three or four, something they could not do if they depended on their finishing position in the league for European qualification,\" said Mark McCafferty, the chief executive of Premiership Rugby. \"The clubs in England and France have served two years' notice that we intend to pull out of Europe because there needs to be a level playing field.</p> <p>\"So far, the response from the other countries has been slow, even though we are not sabre-rattling. We have not been locked in talks and there is no meeting about the issue until the end of next month. Our view is that the qualification process needs to be changed so that it is entirely merit based \u2013 the top teams in all three leagues as well as the winners of the Heineken Cup and the Amlin Challenge Cup should make up 20 sides taking part.\"</p> <p>The English and French clubs want to ration the Pro 12 involvement to the top six teams in the league, which would run a risk of Scotland and Italy, whose teams currently qualify automatically, not being involved in a Heineken Cup campaign.</p> <p>\"I think those countries have effectively made that decision by forming the Pro 12,\" said McCafferty. \"It is like me saying that the Premiership has to provide a qualifier from the south-west. It cannot be good for the competition that you do not have the best sides qualifying. Aironi were disbanded at the end of the last season and the newly formed Zebres go straight into the Heineken Cup.</p> <p>\"Are the Italian teams ready for the Heineken Cup given their record? It is all put into perspective when some really big names are not involved and the system plays a role in the way Leinster and Munster have dominated the competition in recent years. European Rugby Cup Ltd is dragging its heels and I cannot understand it.\"</p> <p>McCafferty acknowledged that the two sides were approaching the problem from different directions. \"Some 80% of our business is the Aviva Premiership,\" he went on. \"It is what drives our revenue and gates.<strong> </strong>I understand the Pro 12 model is different, but we cannot damage our core competition for 20% [the Heineken Cup].<strong> </strong>ERC should know that we are serious and while the issue has to be resolved, everyone has to realise we cannot carry on as we are. If it is not, we would go to an Anglo-French competition and if others wanted to join us, fair enough.</p> <p>\"I feel for the Welsh regions because they are caught in the middle. They have financial issues and you cannot build a business on three home games. Ireland have a central system with the union funding everything apart from the overseas players. Wales are reliant on private money largely and they need a business with 15 home fixtures. I think changing the qualification for Europe would strengthen the RaboDirect.\"</p> <p>ERC denied that it had been slow to respond. \"We have held meetings with all our shareholders and asked them to draw up proposals which will be considered at next month's meeting. Notice was served by the French and English clubs and the French Rugby Federation at the beginning of June and it was agreed at a board meeting a few days afterwards was that we would have a workshop in September after holding briefings with everyone.</p> <p>\"We do not want to enter a war of words with Premiership Rugby, but we have been working away in the background and we are in the second phase of the consultation process.\"</p>",
  "<p>The development of academy schools has posed particular problems for education law, especially where the pupil has special educational needs (SEN). The basic law that applies to children with serious SEN is that local authorities should produce a document, called a statement, that sets out the children's needs, the help they should receive and the school they will attend. If the parents want their child to go to a particular local authority school, they can ask for the school to be named in the statement \u2013 and as long as the school can give the child the additional educational provision they need, and the placement \"is compatible with the provision of efficient education\" for the other pupils, the local authority should agree.</p> <p>Accepting children with statements does not compromise the education of other pupils. Indeed, many schools argue that the presence of pupils with a variety of needs enables other children in the class to develop a broader understanding of the community. &#xa0;</p> <p>Unfortunately, the provisions of the education acts that set this out do not apply to academy schools. As a result, a number of academies have tried to argue they should be able <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/may/24/academies-refusal-pupils-special-needs\" title=\"\">to refuse</a> some children with statements of special needs and that they cannot be forced to take them because an SEN tribunal has no jurisdiction over them. &#xa0;</p> <p>In a case our clients brought against Hackney council in east London, after their son was refused a place at Mossbourne academy, the child in question was very bright and academically able, and required minimal assistance to get round school or deal with his work. It was almost inconceivable his attendance could be anything other than an asset to the school and other pupils. Of course, if the statement issued by the local authority does not provide properly for a child's needs, then the educational experience of all children, not just the pupil with the statement, can be adversely affected. So it is important to get the statement right, and to appeal to a tribunal against a decision by a school to refuse to admit an SEN child if the statement is incorrect or inadequate.</p> <p>Academies have argued that they are not subject to the normal rules governing local authority schools. The document that governs their position is their funding agreement with the Department for Education. But the agreements for the most recent academies have, on the whole, specifically incorporated the same obligations for special needs, admissions and exclusions that apply to maintained schools.</p> <p>Mossbourne, however, has an old-style agreement that does not incorporate the provisions. Yet, through the local authority, it tried to argue not only that it was entitled to reach its own decisions on the admission of children with SEN statements, but also that this could not be the subject of an appeal to a tribunal. As a result of its arguments, our client's appeal was initially struck out.</p> <p>We then appealed to the upper tier of the tribunal, which deals with appeals on points of law. We successfully argued that the tribunal jurisdiction does apply to Mossbourne, and by implication to other academies. The upper tier decided a tribunal had the same powers as the local authority to order a school to accept a child and, if the school continued to resist, the school should appeal to the education secretary.</p> <p>As a result, parents have been able <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/20/academy-loses-challenge-special-needs\" title=\"\">to challenge Mossbourne's refusal</a> to admit eight children with special educational needs, although two of these have been adjourned. Of the six that were heard, all but one has been successful.</p> <p>While the decisions by the individual tribunals are an extremely welcome step, the important point made by the upper tier is that academies cannot shelter behind their funding agreements to avoid their obligations to pupils with special educational needs.</p> <p>What we need instead is an amendment to the current legislation to ensure that all academies \u2013 regardless of their current funding agreements \u2013 are required to operate on precisely the same basis as maintained schools on admissions, exclusions and SEN, and should be subject to the current law and guidance on these issues.</p>",
  "<p>British scientific research startup <a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/\">Mendeley</a> now has 240 third-party apps tapping into its API, querying its database of research papers more than 100m times a month.</p> <p>The company \u2013&#xa0;which was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/jul/05/mendeley-activate\">judged</a> \"most likely to change the world for the better\" at the Guardian Activate Future Technologies pitching contest in 2010 \u2013&#xa0;now has a database of 65m unique research papers uploaded by its 1.8m users.</p> <p>\"Our vision was always to share this information with the academic community to make science more transparent,\" says chief executive Dr Victor Henning. \"There is a massive demand for this type of information, but it has been locked up behind paywalls.\"</p> <p>The established companies that Mendeley is aiming to disrupt are firms like Thomson Reuters and Elseviers, who command annual fees in the tens of thousands of dollars for access to their scientific research databases.</p> <p>Mendeley's business model is similar to consumer cloud service Evernote in some ways: its most basic package for individuals is free, providing 1GB of private storage. They pay for more storage, and there are also premium plans for academic and non-academic/commercial teams.</p> <p>The company opened its API in August 2010, inviting developers to start building applications that tapped into its data. The following year, it held a \"Binary Battle\" contest to foster app ideas, and has since see monthly API calls rise sharply \u2013&#xa0;particularly in 2012, as many of those apps launched publicly.</p> <p>Examples cited by Henning include <a href=\"http://opensnp.org/\">OpenSNP</a>, which helps customers of genotyping services like 23andMe and deCODEme to upload their raw test results to its own database, then find other users with similar genetic variations, and relevant research from Mendeley's database.</p> <p>Henning also says that apps drilling into Mendeley's anonymised data on who's reading each paper \u2013&#xa0;academic status, field of research, location and so on \u2013&#xa0;are also proving popular.</p> <p>In fact, the company has made one itself: a data dashboard called <a href=\"http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/leading-universities-adopt-mendeley-data-to-accelerate-research-analytics-by-3-years/\">Mendeley Institutional Edition</a>. It helps universities analyse research activity in real-time, providing an alternative \u2013&#xa0;a complementary one \u2013 to the traditional \"Impact Factor\" system of academic citations.</p> <p>Are mobile and tablet apps a big factor in Mendeley's ecosystem? Henning says they're increasing in prominence, noting that it's now \"possible to build a thin client on a mobile device to control heavy-duty genome sequencing and the like in the cloud from wherever you are\".</p> <p>That's an ambitious one, though. More nuts'n'bolts mobile apps to access Mendeley's database of papers are more common, including apps for Android and Kindle.</p> <p>\"The main use case is people at a conference or meeting up with a colleague in a cafe or another office, thinking 'I read this paper the other day that would be perfect for this particular problem', and being able to call it up on the spot,\" says Henning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395048803\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345645964750/api-calls_copy.jpg\" alt=\"Mendeley API calls\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">API calls to Mendeley's database have increased sharply in 2012</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what now? Mendeley wants to make it easier for apps built using its API to talk to one another, and to deposit data back into the database. The company also has designs on creating what's effectively its own app store.</p> <p>\"We have an audience of nearly 2m researchers, and we want to promote the apps and help them find their audience,\" says Henning.</p> <p>\"So far, they've done all of their marketing and promotion themselves, which makes it even more astonishing that they're growing as fast as the API call figures show. We're working on a discovery mechanism for these apps to make them more visible on the site.\"</p> <p>There may be some partnerships ahead with the bigger database publishers that Mendeley has been trying to disrupt, too. Henning notes that Elsevier has already built an app to display Mendeley's real-time data alongside papers in its service, for example.</p> <p>He also hopes that opening up the world of scientific research papers will have other effects, such as surfacing relevant papers for non-scientists with particular medical conditions or research interests.</p> <p>There is also the chance to provide access to papers for researchers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the developing world: \"people on the ground in Africa and south east Asia researching solutions to hunger crises, growing food and sustainability\".</p>",

But where on earth he'd find allies today, in a world where Radio 2 playlists Blur, Elbow and the Killers, we haven't a clue. In terms of current trends, White is so off-piste his skis have gone on strike. This isn't ironic soft-rock or retro-MOR. It's just old-fashioned, as in out of date. There's no clever slant to it, and you will either warm to it or you will dismiss it as the tepid hackmanship of a bygone era. Put it this way: Pitchfork wouldn't touch it with a pitchfork, Abeano wouldn't touch it with a copy of the Beano, Stereogum would rather put gum in their stereo, and 20 Jazz Funk Greats would rather feature Al Di Meola and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDLc7kYeXTU\" title=\"\">Lonnie Liston Smith</a>.</p> <p>White \u2013 who is 24 but sounds 42 \u2013 has been likened to James Blunt fronting Coldplay. And still we can't find it in ourselves to despise him. There's something appealing \u2013 noble, even \u2013 about this character who does what so many musicians pay lip service to but eventually recoil from actually doing because it's such a risk: not giving a flying one about contemporary developments and market forces. The self-penned and self-produced Outside In is an object lesson in how to avoid the obvious. Remove that middling, piddling beat, one of the few concessions to modernity, from Black Market Red Roses and it could be a Gilbert O'Sullivan song. Even White's voice, the tone or timbre or whatever the technical word is, reeks of the pre-punk 70s. It's that creamily smooth and suavely reassuring. And we love the way the guitar solo appears to have been tacked on with super-glue.</p> <p>The lyrics are pre-postmodern, too. \"You get so quiet in the most peculiar moments, we act like we're opponents,\" he sings on Waiting to Say Goodbye. They're the kind of words you might expect to hear on a theme tune from a TV show starring John Alderton or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSVWEm_wvC4\" title=\"\">Pauline Collins</a>. You can imagine White back in the day, actually, dating the great Lynsey De Paul and making a cameo in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMFeCcgnYWM\" title=\"\">Man About the House</a> as Richard O'Sullivan's cheeky lothario chum who pops over to charm the dolly birds with his shirt unbuttoned quite low for that sexy chest hair effect.

  "<h2>WHITE HART PAIN</h2> <p>The Fiver always knew this day would come, as inevitable as the morn upon which we will nudge open the door to Granny Fiver's room to find her still and glassy-eyed in her bond@ge chair, and only marginally sadder. The Premier League has finally lost one of its teams to a breakaway league. At least, the Fiver assumes that Andre Villas-Boas is busy preparing Tottenham for life in the North London Elite Seven-A-Side Sunday Superleague, trimming his squad down to a nice round 10 in time for the big kick-off. So long Sebastian! Toodle-oo Tom! M- M... [bah!] Cheerio, Mikey! Ooh, and why not take Jermain with you?</p> <p>Yes, mere hours after Sebastien Bassong joined Norwich City on a three-year deal, Tom Huddlestone was loaned to St- [checks notes \u2026 checks internet \u2026 checks that Tom Huddlestone is who the Fiver thinks he is \u2026 gazes out the window contemplating this sorry world \u2026 dribbles a bit \u2026 shrugs shoulders] -oke City, QPR have had a \u00a39m bid for last week's club captain Michael Dawson accepted, and their interest in Jermain Defoe has gone down very nicely indeed. That just leaves Luka Modric, Rafael van der Vaart, Jermaine Jenas, Giovani dos Santos, David Bentley, Heurelho Gomes, Danny Rose and a Dad's Army board game (missing the Private Pike piece) sat forlornly on the kerb. Still, William Gallas and Jake Livermore were on hand to give Emmanuel Adebayor a warm welcome as his \"Tottenham here I come!\" tweet echoed around the canteen. That's one experienced striker, at least, and with Manchester City paying 53% of Adebayor's wages, Spurs begin life in the NLESASSS laughing.</p> <p>Switching our attention back to QPR faster than Andre Santos and a pack of chasing police cars can get down the A1 [allegedly \u2013 Fiver Lawyers], we find Mark Hughes's feverish attempts to buy an entirely new backline (and a spare to get him through that congested Christmas period) in full swing: having finished sawing a foot off the goalposts at Loftus Road, this afternoon he agreed a deal with Real Madrid for the loan of Ricardo Carvalho. Who had also been on Villas-Boas's list of people to replace Dawson \u2013 the kind of coincidence from which an inexperienced reader might expect the Fiver to be able, by now, to craft a better payoff.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p><strong>14 August:</strong> \"Has his stock risen?

  "<p>A senior member of the Bank of England has warned Berlin to be lenient with indebted eurozone countries or risk the breakup of the currency union.</p> <p>Adam Posen, who steps down as a member of the bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) later this month, said Germany's government and banks were culpable in lending to Greece, Spain and Portugal and should recognise that the debt crisis was as much a result of poor decision-making in Frankfurt and Berlin as Athens, Madrid and Lisbon.</p> <p>He said the Germans would be shooting themselves in the foot if they imposed politically destabilising austerity on Greece and other struggling countries.</p> <p>\"It is in Germany's commercial and economic interests, not just its foreign policy and idealistic interests, to restructure the debt that other countries owe them,\" he said.</p> <p>In a swipe at Angela Merkel's handling of the crisis, he argued that the German chancellor should tell the truth about the culpability of successive German governments and the negative impact from a breakup.</p> <p>Posen, a US economist, also called for the Bank of England to take extra measures to ease credit conditions in the UK and encourage lending.</p> <p>He told the BBC Hardtalk programme that the double-dip recession was \"entirely predictable\" after the coalition accelerated the austerity measures adopted by the previous Labour administration.</p> <p>He repeated his condemnation of the Bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, for giving public support to the policy change, though he praised him for reacting quickly to deteriorating economic conditions, especially after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US, which precipitated the banking crisis in 2008.</p> <p>Posen is renowned for favouring interventionist policies to support economic growth. He lobbied for an increase in the Bank's quantitative easing policy, which he said had been under-used in 2010 and 2011. He argued that an earlier expansion of QE, which involves creating money to encourage bank lending, alongside more direct efforts to promote lending to small and medium-sized businesses, would have increased consumer demand, investment and economic growth.</p> <p>In a sweeping criticism of the limited measures taken by the Bank of England, he said it should buy up mortgages and the debts of non-banking lenders to free up the financial system of overwhelming debts burdens.</p> <p>Too often the MPC had focused on persuading high street banks to lend more rather than considering setting up new banks with a mandate to lend, said Posen.</p> <p>\"We should be buying things other than just gilts, such as bundles of private sector debt and special bonds to finance infrastructure.</p> <p>\"The funding for lending scheme set up by the Bank is a step in the right direction but I think the central bank should do more to go around the existing banking system.\"</p>",

He had been refusing food since the verdict, but contracted pneumonia and \"went rapidly downhill last weekend\", they said.</p> <p>His lawyer, Saimo Chahal of Bindmans, said Nicklinson's wife, Jane, told her after the draft judgment was handed down on 12 August that \"the fight seemed to go out of him\".</p> <p>\"He said that he was heartbroken by the high court's decision that he could not end his life at a time of his choosing with the help of a doctor,\" Chahal said.</p> <p>Nicklinson, 58, died at home at 10am on Wednesday, with his wife, his daughters Beth and Lauren, as well as his sister Ginny, at his side. All had supported his legal action to be helped to die.</p> <p>Wiltshire police said Nicklinson's doctor had certified that his death was from natural causes and they were not involved.</p> <p>Chahal visited Nicklinson two days after the high court decision, along with his barrister, Paul Bowen QC. Communicating via a computer, which he operated by eye movements, he told her: \"So, we lost. In truth I am crestfallen, totally devastated and very frightened. I fear for the future and the misery it is bound to bring.</p> <p>\"I suppose it was wrong of me to invest so much hope and expectation into the judgment but I really believed in the veracity of the arguments and quite simply could not understand how anybody could disagree with the logic.

He and his wife said they would appeal. \"I believe the legal team are prepared to go all the way, but it means yet another period of physical discomfort and mental anguish for me,\" he said at the time.</p> <p>In a statement issued through his lawyers, he added: \"I am saddened that the law wants to condemn me to a life of increasing indignity and misery.\"</p> <p>Although the judge acknowledged that his case and that of another paralysed man, known as Martin, were deeply moving, he said it was for parliament and not the courts to decide if the law should be changed.</p> <p>Nicklinson was paralysed from the neck down after a stroke seven years ago. He wanted assurances from the court that anybody who helped him end his life would be free from prosecution.</p> <p>Neither he nor Martin were physically able to end their lives themselves. Neither wanted or felt able to travel far from their homes and loved ones to Dignitas in Switzerland, where death can be legally administered through a lethal cocktail of drugs.</p> <p>Chahal said that the legal action Nicklinson initiated must now come to an end, but that \"the right to die with dignity, issues that Tony championed, will not be forgotten due to the light that Tony shone on them and \u2026 this important debate will continue due to Tony\".</p> <p>She called Nicklinson \"an extraordinary man\" who was \"gutsy, determined and a fighter to the end\".

  "<p>Though one should never feel sympathy for criminals, for at root, their trade is misery, it is easy to view <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/asil-nadir-guilty-six-theft-charges\" title=\"\">the fall of Asil Nadir and the end of his incredible story</a> with a pang of nostalgia. The people who plunder large corporations these days seem to be a charmless, hachet-faced lot. Asil Nadir always seemed a little different \u2013 and then there was the bizarre troupe of characters that gravitated towards him.</p> <p>Think first of all of those who lost money to help him live the high life, because there is no such thing as a victimless crime, and Nadir siphoned millions from institutions and blameless individuals to pay off his debts.</p> <p>But think then about the way it all played out. This was crime as soap opera.</p> <p>Think of Peter Dimond, the stick-thin, very English character, whose belief in Nadir was such that he <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255831.stm\" title=\"\">willingly turned his life on its head by agreeing to fly the tycoon out of the country</a> to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus \u2013 out of the reach of the British authorities \u2013 in 1993. He was jailed for two years in 1999. Luckily for him, that sentence was overturned when his lawyers established that \u2013 technically \u2013 Nadir was not on bail when he left the country. He spent many years in exile at one of Nadir's hotels. He never doubted his friend's integrity, he told reporters. Nadir just needed time to prepare his defence. Dimond was like a supporting character in a military drama starring Kenneth More.</p> <p>Think of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/nasir-aide-is-jailed-over-stolen--pounds-400000-1343535.html\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Forsyth</a>, the home counties grandmother with the fur and the jewels and the cut-glass accent. The former head of Nadir's personal management company, she was jailed for five years in 1996 for allegedly handling stolen money and spent 10 months in jail but overturned the verdict the following year. The cost of the case against her was estimated at \u00a31m. Warm, persuasive, with the mannerisms of a Conservative party chair from Surrey, she refused to entertain any suggestion of wrongdoing on Nadir's part. She even wrote a labour-of-love book on the crimes done to him: <a href=\"http://www.alibris.co.uk/search/books/isbn/9781856851138\" title=\"\">Who Killed Polly Peck?</a></p> <p>Think too of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/24/newsid_2519000/2519201.stm\" title=\"\">Michael Mates</a>, the former Tory Northern Ireland minister, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/localgovernment/2012/05/michael-mates-seeks-nomination-for-hampshire-police-commissioner.html\" title=\"\">now a Tory candidate for crime commissioner in Hampshire</a>. He was highly respected but once Nadir fled Britain he suffered a blow from which his career never recovered. \"Don't let the buggers get you down\" was the message inscribed onto the back of a watch he sent to Nadir, a Tory donor to the tune of \u00a3500,000. Disclosure of that fact proved lethal, as did the leaking of a letter he sent to the attorney general complaining about how Nadir had been treated.</p> <p>And then of course there was the man himself, whose business and political connections in northern Cyprus allowed him to resume his life there with all the pomp of a returning prince. He owned hotels, factories, and a newspaper, and when he flew back there, he took the world's press with him. Good for him, good for the local economy. Most of the British journalists sent to find him ended up staying in his hotels like the Jasmine Court. Good for his employees; who brought into the courtyard a goat to be slaughtered and eaten to celebrate his homecoming. Good for Fleet Street. The Sun and the Star, seeing headlines at every turn, accosted the goat's owner with local currency and competed to buy it as a mascot for their readers.</p> <p>It was exhilarating for everyone, but it couldn't last. After four days being chased by the British journalists, Nadir \u2013 noting that the thrill had waned for them and for him \u2013 sought them out at the bar and bought them drinks.</p> <p>They would soon be gone; to be followed eventually by the politicians who made life on the island tolerable for him. His options for travel were limited, as were his abilities to trade and to obtain first-class medical treatment for heart and kidney ailments. He returned to Britain in 2010, having established that he would get bail and ebulliently citing his \"burning sense of injustice\". Those grievances will burn deeper now, a feeling that will be shared by all of the characters in the Nadir soap opera. Still, they have their memories.</p> <p>And they have their freedom, but not the leading player. He will spend long years in jail, and as he begins that new life he may reflect on a big miscalculation. Why did he return when he did? Well there was less political cover in northern Cyprus, and in a Turkey keen to recast itself as respecting enough of the international community to join the European Union.</p> <p>In Britain too, there was a political dimension. \"I'm hoping to get a fair trial, if this matter goes to trial, obviously,'' he said boarding the plane for London. ''That was not the case in the past.'' It was, he said, the \"right environment\" to challenge the charges levelled against him. A new government might not feel bound to follow the same hard line as governments before.</p> <p>But that was a mistake, proof perhaps that time away from Britain had dulled his perception. For whole the government changed, so too had the public's mood towards rich businessmen who live high on the hog on money derived from taxpayers and shareholders.

  "<p>I thought that The terrible thing that happened to Barnaby Brocket is a very sweet and charming story. It is by John Boyne, author of The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas, but I think this book is aimed for younger children. Anyhow, I enjoyed the book thoroughly and I think that it can be read and revelled in by boys and girls of any age. It could be a good book for adults, too!</p> <p>The book is about The Brockets, who consider themselves a normal family. Not very normal, (because that wouldn't be normal at all), but just normal. They don't want anything different, and don't like anyone different. Then Barnaby Brocket comes along, and with surprise, he defies the law of gravity and floats. His parents are horrified. They are humiliated. They are scared to go out in public! Enough is enough, and they decide that Barnaby just CAN'T stay. Released into the world, Barnaby's mission is to get home; but is that what he really wants?</p> <p>I cannot really point out anything bad about this book, and would recommend it to everyone who likes a nice, relaxing and witty read.</p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p>",
  "<p>Barely two, possibly three, weeks to go before David Cameron's predicted reshuffle, the first such unforced exercise since the general election. Yet the Whitehall rumour mill is barely generating enough power to fuel a light bulb, apart from that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/20/kenneth-clarke-cabinet-post-reshuffle\" title=\"\">old chestnut about sacking Ken Clarke</a> and the newer ones about Mayor Boris sacking Dave or Dave sacking his chum, George.</p> <p>That's partly because reshuffles usually take place in July to give ex-ministers time away from Westminster to nurse their injured dignity and their successors time to find their way to the departmental loo without help and to start reading through the paperwork before MPs \u2013 including those who thought they should have been promoted \u2013 come back to torment them. In August there's not enough gossip to turn the mill wheel properly.</p> <p>In the British system reshuffles actually took place too frequently in July under both Tory and Labour governments. Ministers need time to get on top of their difficult issues and when they are, they are often moved too rapidly to do much good. Transport and trade (now BIS) are notoriously expendable cabinet posts; while lower down the pecking order, so Chris Mullin noted sorrowfully in his diaries, the Africa minister's post changed seven times under Tony Blair \u2013 and Blair was supposed to care about Africa.</p> <p>Now it's different in several ways. Reshuffles were once two-dimensional. A prime minister had a list of middle-aged white men, usually middle or upper middle-class chaps, and had to balance factions, personalities and ideology. Most of that still applies \u2013 though ideology is mostly at a discount nowadays \u2013 but it's at least four-dimensional. Cameron has the Lib Dems to consider \u2013 a very inhibiting fact \u2013 and he also has gender (women matter!) and possibly regions.</p> <p>There was no Eton quota 50 years ago either, let alone a posh-boy quota; there is now. So unfair when George Osborne's chums in the Bullingdon Club nicknamed him \"Oik\" because he only went to St Paul's, his local independent school in west London.</p> <p>So the inability to move the deckchairs very easily in a two-party, two-gender coalition has been an overall benefit. No, don't tell me about Cameron's urgent need to sack his chancellor. Those two really are \"all in this together\" and \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/21/economy-government-borrowing\" title=\"\">as Nick Watt and team report </a>\u2013 Osborne will be forced to modify Plan A this autumn under pressure from left, right and events. He will tweak it, but not abandon it. Cameron will stand by him.</p> <p>William Hague will therefore not get his job; he will stay \u2013 unhappily, I suspect \u2013 at the Foreign Office. You can't have much of a foreign policy if you don't have much money to spend: Clem Attlee's foreign secretary, the great Ernie Bevin, understood that when he asked the miners to dig more coal.</p> <p>Who else? It's a mug's game, really. The prime minister is on holiday and may even know by now roughly what he'd like to do, but not if he can do it: it was ever thus, as even Margaret Thatcher discovered when Minister A refused to move to Minister B's job or John Patten refused Northern Ireland. The rest of us can only gossip or tip X for Y's job, a notoriously counterproductive activity for MPs and reporters alike.</p> <p>\"The best I can do to help is attack you in print,\" is what I say to over-eager wannabes. Chris Grayling and Grant Shapps, two very eager mid-ranking ministers who are being tipped for promotion (again) would be wise to keep their heads down and stop cultivating hacks. \"The Great Mentioner\", as the US version is sometimes known in Washington, has ruined many a career.</p> <p>Will Ken Clarke finally be dropped over the side at 72? As a young barrister of very modest background \u2013 his dad was a watchmaker \u2013 the current justice secretary and lord chancellor was first elected in 1970 (at 29), became a government whip under Ted Heath two years later and has been (uniquely) in every Tory government for every day of their existence ever since. His only rival, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Young,_6th_Baronet\" title=\"\">Sir George Young</a> (71), leader of the Commons, was briefly sacked by Thatcher for quasi-communism (he's a mildly liberal Etonian) before being brought back (also uniquely). The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9484990/David-Camerons-reshuffle-headache-as-Ken-Clarke-digs-in.html\" title=\"\">Sunday Telegraph reported</a> Clarke as \"refusing\" to go, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/20/kenneth-clarke-cabinet-post-reshuffle\" title=\"\">the Guardian as \"fighting\" for his (and Young's) job</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19324097\" title=\"\">BBC reports </a>Clarke as languidly denying both while saying he wants to remain in post because he has an agenda to complete.</p> <p>Clarke's been round this course so often, it must be boring. In the rightwing's cooking pot, then rescued again at the last minute. Being confident enough and disinclined to piety to speak his mind, he gets into scrapes. His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/18/david-cameron-urged-sack-kenneth-clarke-rape\" title=\"\">\"date rape\" remark</a> in 2011 has echoes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/21/george-galloway-rape-comments-respect\" title=\"\">George Galloway's current furore</a>: you can see the distinction they're trying to make, that violent sexual assault by a burglar in the dead of night is quite a different experience. It's not an acceptable thing to say in the present social climate.</p> <h2>Jazz</h2> <p>But \"relaxed\" and \"fighting\" for his job can't be true? Of course they can. He wants to stay on but will find plenty to do \u2013 he has all that hinterland in jazz, bird-watching, cigars, cricket and books \u2013 if his time is up. Ditto George Young, though I suspect the other oldster around the coffin-shaped cabinet table, Vince Cable, a slightly less youthful 69, would be more upset to be sacked because he feels he represents a counterweight in government to the neo-liberal tendencies represented by so many younger colleagues, including Nicholas Clegg. For that reason alone I expect him to stay put.</p> <p>Interestingly all three oldies are on the leftish side of most Tory arguments. Does that reflect greater wisdom and experience ? Yes, says elderly me. No, reply the Desperate <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/author/danielhannan/\" title=\"Daniel Hannan: Telegraph blog\">Daniel Hannans </a>of this world, it's generational prejudice which is out of date. We'll see. How's the supply side economic recovery coming along, Dan?</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/\" title=\"\">who exactly is in cabinet? </a>They are not household names or faces. Cheryl Gillan, the high-speed-train-bashing Welsh secretary, seems set to go, but that will barely be noticed even in Cardiff. Her likely successor, clever Maria Miller, grew up in Wales, but this may be a temporary post in transit upwards.</p> <p>Michael Gove? He'll stay put, he's the current star of the restless Tory pundits. Andrew Lansley? He's got to stay, he's the only one who understands his legislation. Jeremy Hunt? A tempting target after the Murdoch fiasco.</p> <p>Watching Hunt and Clarke give evidence on the same day to the Leveson inquiry I did the maths and realised that Ken has been an MP six times as long as Jezza. And boy, did it show. That's the real reason for keeping him in cabinet: it's the oldies who can say: \"Sorry, that won't work.\" But moving Hunt or sacking him will stir the hornet's nest too.</p> <p>I'd wager that Caroline Spelman (environment) is vulnerable, as is Lady Warsi (party chairman) except that she's a two-fer, both a woman and a Muslim one. Eric Pickles (communities and local government), anyone? No, he's more or less working-class and Yorkshire, every cabinet needs a sample. IDS? No, he cares even if he gets a lot wrong (like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/21/councils-invest-food-banks-welfare-cuts\" title=\"\">food banks</a>). Andrew Mitchell (international development)? Would you notice? But he's a symbol of defanged Toryism and (I think) a Dave chum. Crafty Lord Strathclyde (Lords)? Good question, but it no longer matters, now they've junked Lords reform.</p> <p>Another thing. Since Osborne's in the doghouse his fingerprints can't be seen on this reshuffle, so his acolytes (Matt Hancock?) shouldn't waste too much time waiting by the phone. Even before Clegg offers his two pennies' worth, it's tricky, and cabinet government matters less than it did in an era of over-mighty quasi-presidential leadership. It should matter more, so a strong cabinet matters. Even Thatcher, who started so much of the rot, knew that and liked people who stood up to her (for a time, anyway).</p> <p>One last thought. Those Tory MPs elected in 2010 and especially 2005 are no longer the patient souls of yesterday: they want jobs and want them now; they have self-belief. If they see court favourites such as Hancock, Nick Boles or Claire Perry (unlucky enough to have a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/may/27/claire-perry-new-iron-lady\" title=\"\">recent Guardian profile</a>) getting a foot on the ministerial ladder they will be cross. The Cameroons have quite enough aggro on their party management plate without creating more.</p> <p>As for Boris Johnson, ex-MP Paul Goodman offers a witty account of the angel and devil wrestling for his soul <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/08/draft-urrrggghhh-aaaarrrggghhh-an-angel-an-devil-wrestle-for-boriss-soul.html\" title=\"\">here on the ConservativeHome website</a>.

  "<p>Silly me. I dared to feel a moment of hope this week, after the idiotic Missouri congressman and senatorial candidate Todd Akin, while discussing abortion rights and why nobody should have them, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/20/missouri-todd-akin-legitimate-rape-abortion-video\" title=\"\">insisted that \"legitimate rape\", as he put it, rarely leads to pregnancy</a>.</p> <p>His fellow Republicans remarkably hastened to distance themselves from the ignoramus, and urged him to drop out of the senate race. The Republican National Committee <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/21/rnc-chair-says-akin-should-drop-out-funding-has-been-pulled/\" title=\"\">went so far as to pull funding</a> from his campaign. I dared hope Akin would prove the darkness before the dawn, the moment America's right wing would collectively snap out of it and cry: \"What happened? We've hit rock bottom! Republicans are supposed to be the party of small government, personal liberty and fiscal responsibility, remember? Not the haven for theocrats, science deniers and constant smouldering outrage at the thought of consenting adults engaging in non-procreative sexual activity!\"</p> <p>Nope. Turns out Republicans don't disagree with Akin's abortion views so much as deplore his discussing them in public. The first rule of the Medieval-Flavored Misogyny Club is don't talk about the Medieval-Flavored Misogyny Club, especially not a couple of days before GOP conventioneers announce their extremist anti-abortion plank in this year's campaign platform.</p> <p>As James Hohmann <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79945.html\" title=\"\">reported</a> for Politico:</p> <blockquote> \"Even as Mitt Romney sought to quash the furor surrounding Todd Akin's 'legitimate' rape comments, the Republican platform committee [in Tampa, Florida] approved an abortion plank that includes no exemptions for rape, incest or even to save the life of the mother. <br>\"The platform committee instead approved draft language Tuesday, calling for a 'Human Life Amendment' that gives legal protection to the unborn.\" </blockquote> <p><em>Even to save the life of the mother</em>. The anti-abortion brigades need to quit calling themselves \"pro-life\" when they're clearly \"pro-forced gestation\", because there's nothing remotely pro-life about telling a pregnant woman, \"better you die in childbirth than live childfree\". Don't mistake me for some bleeding-heart liberal, here. I've no inherent objection to the death penalty; I concur that certain actions are so evil that whoever commits them deserves death by command of the state. I just don't think being a woman with an ectopic pregnancy qualifies.</p> <p>Forced-gestation supporters never explicitly say, \"I want to control women's sexuality\". Their justification for urging pregnant rape victims to give birth, or ordering women with life-threatening pregnancies to literally drop dead, is that once the sperm hits the ovum, the resulting zygote is equal to you and me and has a right not to be aborted identical to our right not to be murdered.</p> <p>And suppose the forced gestationists are correct, and a microscopic zygote really does deserve the same legal rights as us. Would that justify banning abortions for pregnancies that can be carried to term without killing the mother? No. Even if embryos have rights identical to yours and mine, we don't have the right to demand another person's body or biological functions be used to sustain our own. Imagine you need a bone marrow or liver transplant and only one person is a compatible donor for you. Have you the right to force her to donate against her will? Can you compel another to suffer pain for your benefit? Demand a woman submit to invasive procedures on her body, if necessary to keep yours alive? Commandeer the use of all her biological systems for the greater part of a year? Of course not. You can't even force your own mother to do this. But the GOP thinks you should \u2013 at least until the umbilical cord is cut.</p> <p>Do Republicans really think this will win them the election? I'm only half-joking when I wonder if the GOP's been commandeered by secret-agent Democrats aiming to make Obama the lesser of two evils, no matter how terrible a president he is. Many Americans like me, who voted for Obama in 2008, were soon dismayed to see that on multiple civil liberties issues (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/18/tsa-mission-creep-us-police-state\" title=\"\">TSA</a>, government transparency, whistleblower punishment, drug war, drone wars, warrantless surveillance et al), he's measurably worse than Bush. Obama makes me yearn for the freedom I enjoyed under vice president Cheney and before 2009, I figured only powerful hallucinogens could ever do that. Had the GOP nominated some sane, moderate, pro-liberty candidates \u2013 <a href=\"http://jon2012.com/\" title=\"\">Jon Huntsman</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Johnson\" title=\"\">Gary Johnson</a>, perhaps \u2013 they might've had a real chance of overcoming Obama's incumbent's advantage and retaking the White House this November.</p> <p>Instead, they gave us candidates identical to Obama on every major civil liberty issue, save the two issues where they're even worse: \"You know what's really wrong with America? Too many gay people getting married, and too many straight women having sex. Vote Republican. We'll fix <em>them.</em>\"</p>",
  "<p>The bloodbath of a final episode suggested a comeback was out of the question. But television's appetite for remaking sci-fi classics of yesteryear has extended to Blake's 7, the story of interstellar renegades which came to an end on BBC1 in 1981.</p> <p>Blake's 7, which was dubbed \"The Dirty Dozen in space\", is being remade for the same US cable TV channel, Syfy, that successfully revived another 70s sci-fi show, Battlestar Galactica, in 2004.</p> <p>Doctor Who was reinvented for a new Saturday teatime audience by BBC1, but not every reboot of a fondly remembered show has been successful \u2013 ITV1's new version of The Prisoner proved short-lived despite an all-star cast featuring Sir Ian McKellen.</p> <p>It remains to be seen what form the Blake's 7 remake will take or how faithful it will be to the original. Veteran director Martin Campbell, who helmed Piers Brosnan's first outing as James Bond in Goldeneye, is set to direct the pilot.</p> <p>The reworked Battlestar Galactica took the basic plot of the original \u2013 ragtag space fleet of humans struggle for survival after sneak attack by cyborg baddies, the Cylons, wipes out their home planets \u2013 but took it in a much darker direction than the cheesy 70s source material. It found extra resonance with a new audience with its storylines' parallels with the post-9/11 terrorist threat and war in Iraq.</p> <p>Despite the shaky sets and basic special effects synonymous with many 70s TV sci-fi shows, Blake's 7 was watched by audiences of 10 million viewers in the UK and developed a loyal following which remains to this day.</p> <p>Blake's 7, about a band of escaped convicts led by Roj Blake, played by Gareth Thomas, and later Kerr Avon (Paul Darrow) who wage war on the evil Federation, may or may not offer an opportunity for a modern-day allegory or two.</p> <p>Created by Terry Nation, who was also responsible for creating Doctor Who's Daleks, Blake's 7 began on BBC1 in 1978 and ran for four series.</p> <p>It ended on a bleak note, with all of the rebels apart from Avon shot by rebel guards. The final scene, in which Avon stepped over Blake's body, raised his gun and smiled before shots rang out, suggested Avon was killed as well.</p> <p>It is not the first time the space opera has been earmarked for a TV revival. None have so far been successful, although it was revived as a series of audio dramas, some of which have been broadcast by the BBC, and books.</p> <p>Darrow wrote a novel, Lucifer, based on the series and picking up from the end of the show, suggesting Avon wasn't killed after all.</p> <p>The new version of the show, which will be produced by US TV producer Georgeville Television,.</p> <p>It will be directed by Campbell and written by Joe Pokaski, whose credits include another TV sci-fi show, Heroes.

  "<p>Hundreds of guests wanted to celebrate their friends' wedding day. Scores of Chinese police and security officials were equally determined to stop them.</p> <p>Many of the wellwishers were halted before they even boarded trains to Hubei province. Others made it as far as the venue, where almost 100 were detained and some beaten, said the bride, Wang Xifeng.</p> <p>\"I predicted the pressure and the threats when I chose this path, but I had never experienced it before. I am very scared,\" she told the Guardian.</p> <p>The path is marriage to a veteran democracy activist. Qin Yongmin's campaigns have repeatedly angered authorities; the 59-year-old was released from the latest of his three jail terms in late 2010, having served 12 years for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/dec/18/johngittings1\" title=\"\">subversion of state power after trying to register an independent political party</a>.</p> <p>In addition to the disruption of their wedding in Qin's hometown of Wuhan in May, said Wang, the couple have been detained twice and repeatedly harassed, are under round-the-clock surveillance and remain legally unwed, despite holding a ceremony, because the authorities refuse to register them and issue a marriage certificate.</p> <p>The authorities cited problems with their household registration documents, which every Chinese person needs, but Wang said officials had either failed or in some cases flat out refused to carry out the procedures needed to resolve the issue.</p> <p>Wang, 36, has now written an open letter to the United Nations asking for help. According to her account, released via <a href=\"http://www.hrichina.org/\" title=\"\">the group Human Rights in China</a>, she terminated a pregnancy because she feared that without a marriage licence she could be forced into a late-term abortion for breaching China's strict birth control laws. Although such measures are illegal in China, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/11/chinese-payout-woman-forced-abortion\" title=\"\">they still occur</a>.</p> <p>She alleged officials even pressed her ex-husband to urge her to return to him, and investigated her relatives \u2013 including her late father's first wife, who was married to him 50 years ago.</p> <p>Wang, who formerly worked at a middle school in Shanxi province, contacted Qin in February after reading about his work. She said that she was not an activist but supported democracy and human rights.</p> <p>\"We decided to get married because we have same beliefs, the same values,\" she told the Guardian.</p> <p>But they were detained shortly before their wedding and Wang was held again the following month for \"unlawful cohabitation\", she wrote, during what should have been their honeymoon. In August they detained her for a third time.</p> <p>\"Even when we leave [our] district, if we take the bus, they follow us; if we take a private car, they actually force their way into the car to go with us,\" she wrote.</p> <p>\"As soon as we leave the house, they follow us by foot, by motorcycle, or by car. During our morning jog, they not only follow us by bicycle, but they park a car along our path to watch us. Even if we sit at home all day, the authorities still position numerous people near our house. Not only do they arbitrarily detain our visitors, they also occasionally come into our home and harass us.</p> <p>\"All of this unlawful persecution is something the average person cannot even imagine, much less withstand.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the government of Honggangcheng in Qingshan district, Wuhan, where the couple live, said: \"They did not report this situation to us. I have not heard about this.\"</p> <p>Calls to the civil affairs office, which oversees marriage registration offices, rang unanswered.</p> <p>An official at the Qingshan district police branch said he was unaware of the situation but would check with other departments and respond.</p> <p>Qin stopped giving interviews in March, writing that he could not bear any further burden after repeated detentions in the previous three months.</p> <p>But would-be wedding guests echoed Wang's description of events in interviews with the US broadcaster Radio Free Asia earlier this year. One said he had been put under house arrest to prevent him attending, while another said several friends were stopped as they travelled to Wuhan from across China. A third made it to the event, but said he was beaten for taking photographs there.</p> <p>Wang told the Guardian that despite her fears and sense of insecurity, she had no regrets about her marriage.</p> <p>\"I hope I can help to take care of Mr Qin and help him with his life. It would be my great happiness,\" she said. \"We won't separate. We are and will always be together.\"</p>",

  "<p>Literature is one of humankind's greatest weapons. Books have the power to transport the reader to a whole new dimension, into a parallel world where fantasy and reality often become entwined as one. They have the power to influence our thoughts and emotions; they reach out to us and leave an impression that will shape our actions in a way that we may not even realise. Fiction has become a way of conveying a message, a means by which serious matters can be brought to light in the mind of a child in a way that continues to satisfy our urge for drama, thrills and romantic escapism.</p> <p>The Edinburgh International Book Festival event was the perfect way of highlighting the bridge built between literature and human rights. It supplied meaningful debates, tough questioning and the birth of insight into a whole new concept - the idea of using fiction to underline and explore human rights issues for primary and secondary school students. </p> <p>An expert panel of both authors and teachers came together to give an inspiring and thought-provoking discussion about the role of fiction in educating children about human rights. Each offered their own take on the subject, but all left the audience with the same feeling of enlightenment, with the whole theatre gaining the knowledge that fiction can, and should be used as a key weapon in the fight for awareness of human rights issues for children.</p> <p>All children read books because they can - in some way - relate to the words on the page. In young children picture books can awaken a sense of empathy, and understanding that certain situations should not exist in a world where everyone deserves equality and should not be denied any of their basic human rights. Even though a message may not be clearly written in black and white, or described vividly through illustration, it should still be able to shape children's thoughts and feelings concerning human rights issues. Fiction can be used to bring teenagers closer to the truth about life and the harsh reality of growing up is portrayed through a story. They can relate to the characters, building imaginary friendship between themselves and the teen protagonist also struggling through hellish teenage life. Serious issues including oppression, segregation and lack of equality are written in a way that allows the teen to develop their own opinions based on reality. Then, under the guidance of teachers and parents they can be urged to step forward and voice their protests using organisations such as Amnesty International to help make a change.</p> <p>To many young people the issues concerning human rights in their everyday lives are simply overlooked, seen in an abstract manner that does not take priority in the mind of an over-burdened teenager. But fiction is creating a new path for human rights awareness, it's the beginning of a journey where the gripping story is foremost and the deeper message is locked in the background, waiting to be opened and explored by the reader. Children's awareness over human rights issues is being deliberately targeted through literature because fiction is a way of starting a conversation, bringing normally unspoken or controversial subjects to life. The writer is able to take you to the fictitious door of an issue concerning human rights but only opening it a crack; leaving the reader to develop and discover the true and realistic problems facing people worldwide. </p> <p>The panel at the Edinburgh International Book Festival underlined the fact that reading fiction will show children that one person can make a change. This person may be the author, writing with the intention of creating awareness but, then again this person may be one teenager standing up to injustice and striving to make a difference. Surely we can learn from what we read? Our world needs people to step forward, to realise that globally people are fighting for the simple human rights which some take for granted. In reality one person alone may not be able to change the world like in the happy endings of our favourite novels, but they can act as a catalyst - a trigger which starts off an uncontrollable reaction, a reaction which could change the way we view our entire world. So why not ask yourself this the next time you put down the latest gripping novel you've been reading: how can I make a difference, how can I become the hero?</p> <p><a href=\"www.amnesty.org.uk/youth\">Find out more about Amnesty's work</a></p> <p>If you teach teens and want to find out more, <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_22658.pdf \">Amnesty has a PDF of resources</a></p>",
  "<p>\"One person can make a difference. It's the theme that runs through the stories I write and the books I cherish. It's also the foundation of the amazing work Amnesty International has accomplished over the years. Amnesty harnesses the power of ordinary people from around the world and encourages them to stand up for human rights. </p> <p>At the Edinburgh International Book Festival, I had the chance to discuss with teachers and librarians how books can serve as conversation starters on human rights, using my debut novel Dark Parties as an example. </p> <p>For me, writing fiction is an exercise in creativity and debate. I want to challenge myself as a storyteller but also consider important issues. I write not because I have the answer but because I'm interested in the question. Dark Parties asks \u2013 what would happen if a country closed its borders to people and ideas? I wanted to explore issues of personal and national identity as well as diversity and human rights. </p> <p>My 16-year-old main character Neva lives in a country that has closed itself for hundreds of years under an electrified dome. Its resources are dwindling and its citizens are dying. Neva and her best friend dream of a life outside this protective dome. They stage a rebellion and uncover secrets and lies that threaten Neva's friends, family and country. She must decide what she will sacrifice for freedom. </p> <p>I enjoy writing and reading books that entertain and explore interesting and timely issues. But there's a fine line between raising issues and preaching a point of view. Some teen books preach rather than persuade. Listed below are 10 books that strike the right balance between pace and meaning and dare their readers to think for themselves.\"</p> <p>Sara Grant was born and raised in a small town in the Midwestern United States. Dark Parties, her first young adult novel, is a dystopian thriller touching on human rights, diversity, identity, and forbidden love. Sara lives in London.

She also blogs as part of <a href=\"http://edgeauthors.blogspot.co.uk\">the EDGE</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781780620107\">Buy Dark Parties at the Guardian bookshop</a></p> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781905537327\">Nothing by Janne Teller</a> </h2> <p>Pierre Anthon stands up in class and declares \"nothing matters\". His classmates decide to prove him wrong with tragic and astonishing consequences. This book will shock you. There were moments when I wanted to put it down, moments that I swallowed back disgust at the truth being told, but it's a real meaning of life book and truly original.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099419785\">To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee</a></h2> <p>Don't be put off by adults telling you this book won the Pulitzer or that it's good literature. I'm ashamed to say I only read it a few years ago and wished I hadn't waited so long. The story is captivating and honest. Its message of equality rings as true today \u2013 and is as important \u2013 as when it was written in 1960.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780316049979\">Freaks and Revelations by Davida Wills Hurwin</a> </h2> <p>This book \u2013 based on a true story \u2013 is heartbreaking. I was absolutely sobbing by the end. Not choked up or misty-eyed but sobbing. Told in alternating perspectives, it follows two teens \u2013 one a neo-Nazi and the other gay \u2013 on their crash course to a hate crime that will change both their lives. It's tragic and yet hopeful. </p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781444001839\">My Sister Lives on the Mantelpiece by Annabel Pitcher </a></h2> <p>The voice of narrator 10-year-old Jamie leaps off the page. I loved his quirky way of looking at life. His family has been devastated by a terrorist act. The book tackles many issues \u2013 racism, injustice, and bullying to name a few \u2013 but at its heart is a wonderful story of friendship and acceptance.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781407109084\">The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins</a></h2> <p>Sure, you can take this book at face value. It's an action-packed dystopian tale of a fight to the death. But there's also a commentary on society's perverse fascination with reality television. Heroes and villains are created and lives destroyed all in the name of entertainment. </p> <h2>6. Going Bovine by Libba Bray </h2> <p>This story takes you on an ab-so-lutely bizarre quest. Cameron, a teen boy suffering from mad-cow disease; a dwarf; a punk angel; and a garden gnome, who may be a Viking god, search for a cure for Cameron's fatal disease \u2013 and the meaning of life. You will need to read this book more than once to absorb its rich layers. Get ready for a real test of your imagination and, well, your sanity!</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780552555708\">Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman </a></h2> <p>This is a Romeo and Juliet-style romance but it's so much more. Its premise turns prejudice upside down. It's one of those books that propels you to the final page but stays with you long after you've closed the book.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747570639\">A Gathering Light by Jennifer Donnelly</a></h2> <p>This is a story within a story about two young women whose lives link in the summer of 1906 at Big Moose Lake. The end of one life is revealed in letters discovered by the other. There's murder and romance, but at its core is one young writer struggling to realise her dream. I've read this book twice \u2013 once for sheer pleasure and the second time with pencil in hand. I wanted to dissect it and figure out how it captivated me in a way few books have before or since. I realised that I may be able to diagram its many plots and list its cast of characters but what Donnelly has created takes a little bit of magic.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780860685111\">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou</a></h2> <p>This is the only non-fiction title on my list. The beloved American poet recounts her tumultuous childhood. It's an inspiring story of one girl's ability to overcome racism and violence and still be able to find beauty and poignancy in the world. </p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846143830\">The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein</a> </h2> <p>Ok, this isn't a teen book. I received this picture book when I was a child, and it still touches me every time I read it. It's about one boy's love for a tree and vice versa \u2013 and unconditional love. The plot may sound strange but the book demonstrates that few words and the starkest of illustrations are necessary to capture your heart.</p> <p>And because it's difficult to stop at 10, I'd like to direct you to two other book lists. I'm part of a group of authors who create fiction for teens. We've joined forces because our books deal with important issues such as alcoholism, asylum seekers, knife crime and medical ethics. I'd recommend any book by EDGE authors. You can check out our books and our list of edgy reads at: <a href=\"http://edgeauthors.blogspot.com\">http://edgeauthors.blogspot.com</a>. Amnesty also has developed a list of inspiring books. Visit the education section of the Amnesty site for their reading list at <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/education\">amnesty.org.uk/education</a>.</p> <p>I hope these books will inspire you but I also hope you'll do more than read about rebellion.

  "<p>A week of sleepless nights, the various scenarios playing out in your head \u2013 A-level results day nerves this year were more heightened than ever for admissions teams and university marketers.</p> <p>Since the government funding of higher education institutes was cut, universities have been getting to grips with their new identity. Some have been employing a small army of brand consultants, ready for the moment students demand value for money and choose an institute based upon quantifiable outcomes and service (ie. its <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/lt/publicinfo/kis/\" title=\"\">key information set</a>), rather than cheap beer and a good male to female ratio.</p> <p>With so much effort placed upon market positioning, and getting it right when students walk in the door it's a shame that both candidates and universities were let down on results day by the very technology designed to welcome students in.</p> <p>On results day, the systems used by university staff to process student applications <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/17/clearing-thousands-students-waiting-university?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">went down for three hours in the afternoon</a>, leaving many students unable to progress beyond a verbal offer, get a clearing number or register for adjustment. After last year's track problems (the system was declared down while the higher education minister was on live television) there was pressure on UCAS to get it right. Prior to the big day we heard that improved cloud hosting would ensure the servers could scale to meet demand. As it turned out it was the back end of the system used by universities that gave way.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/\" title=\"\">On The Student Room</a>, we became aware of this issue early in the afternoon by the volume of students asking the same questions about track not updating - some of them highlighted below. Results day is an emotional time and for many that missed the grades for their conditional offer it was unfortunate that they had the uncertainty of an additional sleepless night to find out their HE fate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Does anyone else have any other advice? I feel physically sick with worry and am scared I will miss my place waiting on track updating!</p> </blockquote> <p>Technology can go wrong and often does but there was little excuse for UCAS not communicating that there were problems to students. What was needed was reassurance: that they weren't alone and that they would be able to progress, just that it would take longer (until the morning of the 17 August) to happen.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My firm [offer] was unsuccessful this morning, then managed to get a place somewhere in clearing, now I check track its reverted back to conditional? What's going on \u2013 is this an error? I need to put my clearing choice in at 5 and am starting to have a panic attack.</p> </blockquote> <p>With the lifting of the cap enabling universities to recruit unlimited students graded AAB and above, it was always going to be a challenging year for admissions teams juggling student numbers. This was exasperated by the UCAS system problems. It was unclear to students what was going on, who was at fault and who to contact to get a confirmed place at university.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I've called them [my university] and they're saying they have (released me) and that UCAS is down, then I call UCAS and they say they haven't been down? Confused!</p> </blockquote> <p>This confusion reflected badly on universities. In the new world of higher fees and market competitiveness university marketing teams will need to be understand their 'customers', use data in clever ways and ensure their reputation is upheld. This translates as taking control.</p> <p>Universities are diverse organisations. Control of internal systems and departments is a challenge for many, let alone control of the systems of an external body. Universities rely on UCAS to deliver a service on their behalf to students, to collate and provide them with important applicant data and to process students smoothly into their university. For hours on results day many universities had no control of their own admissions and their 'customers' were left in the dark.</p> <p>The application process gets more complicated every year (soon you will need a degree to apply to study a degree) and many students aren't taught by their schools and colleges how to navigate the results day process through clearing or adjustment.</p> <p>The experience of getting into university should be as polished as the experience students have been told to expect when they arrive. When this falls down a university's reputation is on the line. I suspect if there were a pot of money to throw at the technology infrastructure challenges faced by UCAS that it would have happened by now. Whether or not there is a tech upgrade, communication should certainly be improved next year so that the system is more transparent and universities can welcome students into higher education without the drama.</p> <p><em>Jamie O'Connell is marketing director of online student network, </em><a href=\"http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>The Student Room</em></a><em> \u2013 follow it on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/studentroom\" title=\"\"><em>@studentroom</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Its status as the iconic Soviet statement of anti-Nazi resistance has been tempered, over the years, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony_%28book%29\" title=\"\">by arguments</a> that the piece is as much about Stalinist oppression as the second world war.</p> <p>The power of Nelsons' interpretation lay in his understanding of the score's emotive nature and intent. This is music that demands we be thrown off balance and drawn into total identification with its world, and Nelsons, conducting with unswerving passion, achieved precisely that. Passion alone, however, can lead to flaws of pace in this work, and beneath Nelsons' energy lurked secure control of its structure and trajectory. The emotional high point, tellingly, came not during the convulsions of the first movement, but in the third, in which echoes of Russian orthodox church music suggest a ritualised outpouring of communal grief. An exhausting, elating experience, and absolutely unforgettable.</p> <p>It was preceded by <a href=\"http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/glinka.php\" title=\"\">Glinka</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruslan_and_Lyudmila_%28opera%29\" title=\"\">Ruslan and Lyudmila</a> Overture and the UK premiere of <a href=\"http://www.emilyhoward.com/\" title=\"\">Emily Howard</a>'s Calculus of the Nervous System.</p> <p>The Glinka was all fire, rapture and excitement. Calculus, in contrast, is self-consciously cool, at times even chilly. It forms the final part of a triptych inspired by the work of <a href=\"http://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/lovelace.html\" title=\"\">Ada Lovelace</a> (1815-52), a daughter of Byron and a noted mathematician. One of Lovelace's aims was the creation of a mathematical model that demonstrated how the brain gives rise to thoughts, and Howard, in response, scrutinises the nature of memory as tone clusters and percussive throbs shift in and out of focus.

  "<p>While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/11/haiti-earthquake-promised-aid-not-delivered\" title=\"\">two years have passed</a> since Haiti's traumatic 2010 earthquake, local residents still insist that crime is their top priority. Not surprisingly, violent crime prevention is also on the agenda of foreign donors and aid organisations. And yet the situation has deteriorated over the past 12 months. What is more, police and justice services are still largely out of reach for ordinary citizens, especially those living in \"popular zones\" of the capital city, Port-au-Prince.</p> <p>The seriousness of the law and order situation is not entirely lost on Haiti's leadership. But the risk is that the government and its backers may attempt to restore security through heavy-handed enforcement measures alone. This might not only make a bad situation worse, but would almost certainly gloss over chronic needs of crime victims. And while Haiti's national police and justice sectors undeniably require support, this cannot be provided at the expense of survivors and their families.</p> <p>Virtually everyone agrees that rates of violent crime have soared in recent months. This spike must be set against Haiti's <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/mcs/2010/00000026/00000004/art00005\" title=\"\">impressive gains in safety between 2007 and 2011</a>. However, Port-au-Prince's homicide rate spiralled to more than <a href=\"http://pt.igarape.org.br/haitis-urban-crime-wave-results-from-monthly-households-surveys-aug2011-feb2012/\" title=\"\">60 homicides per 100,000 people</a> by February 2012. Recent surveys conducted by the Igarape Institute reveal that despite some fluctuation, it has shifted upwards to roughly <a href=\"http://www.igarape.org.br\" title=\"\">72 per 100,000 by late July</a>. By way of comparison, the global average homicide rate is <a href=\"http://www.genevadeclaration.org/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2011.html\" title=\"\">closer to 7 per 100,000</a>.</p> <p>The geographic and demographic characteristics of Haiti's crime wave are unevenly felt. For example, residents of the capital city's slums are more than 40 times more likely to be a victim of homicide than other urban dwellers. The incidence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2011/dec/06/haiti-rape-survivor-speaks-out-video\" title=\"\">of sexual violence</a> is also especially pronounced among young women and girls regardless of what strata of society they come from. Likewise, property crime and banditry are taking their toll, particularly among the poorer populations of the capital.</p> <p>The impacts of Haiti's recent surge in crime endure long after the shooting stops. Children are especially vulnerable when a death occurs in the family; many are pulled out of school and sent to live with other families as <em>restaveks</em>, Creole for unpaid domestic servants. Since mid-2011, the average costs of a physical or sexual assault on a typical household member amounts to a fifth of their annual income. A murder results in expenses that are more than five times an average family's annual income of $1,200 a year.</p> <p>The costs of violent crime accumulate quickly. For example, burial and funeral costs average almost $5,000 per household. Nearly all of the households we surveyed take out loans to pay these costs. The interest fees charged by money-lenders are extortionate, ranging from 50% to 150% a month. Compounding all this are bribes that are regularly paid out to the police: up to a quarter of all victims of physical assault and property crimes were asked to pay a bribe to see their cases progress. The average cost of these bribes is about $16.</p> <p>Despite these alarming trends, there are some practical steps that the Haitian government and international donor community can take to arrest the costs of violence crime. A priority is a clear affirmation by the country's leaders of the gravity of the situation on the ground. This must be accompanied not with political posturing, but rather action to ensure that policing and justice provision gets to under-serviced areas. Unless this happens, criminal violence will continue rolling back meager development gains.</p> <p>The Haitian government and its supporters can also pay more attention to minimising the crippling debts generated by crime. For example, they can support low-interest loan alternatives for families who have lost their loved ones through violence. Likewise, new oversight measures can be introduced to reduce police bribery which, after a gradual decline, appears to be increasing once more. Finally, special measures can be taken to support victimised children, including with medical assistance, so that they are not traumatised for the rest of their lives.</p>",
  "<p>She could have spent the long, hot summer holiday hanging out with friends or helping at home. But instead, 15-year-old Bashaer Othman is making speeches, signing documents, chairing meetings, attending civic functions and meeting citizens as mayor of Allar, a small Palestinian town high in the West Bank hills.</p> <p>Every morning, Bashaer heads off to the municipal offices, where she has full control \u2013 except for financial matters \u2013 as part of an unusual summer experiment aimed at empowering young people.</p> <p>For two months, the regular mayor, Sufian Shadid, and his team of councillors have handed the reins of power to a group of teenagers. The adults are on hand to advise and offer guidance, but all the decisions are left to be made by the youngsters.</p> <p>\"At the beginning, people were critical because of our age,\" says Bashaer. \"But then they saw us working, and that we were tough and dedicated, and now they respect us.\"</p> <p>Bashaer is the first female mayor for the town of 9,000 residents. The regular 11-strong council includes two women, who are appointed under a quota system. But this summer, the gender balance is close to equal, with five girls and six boys serving the town.</p> <p>Halfway through her term, Bashaer has presided over a vote to set up a local fire department and establish Allar's first public park with a children's playground. She has also represented the town on a trip to Qatar. But she identifies the most important local issue as unemployment, especially among youth.</p> <p>\"If I could achieve one thing, it would be to create a project to provide as many youth jobs as possible,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Many people from Allar are crossing the Green Line [entering Israel illegally] to work,\" adds Bashaer. \"Instead of them going to work as cheap labour in Israel, we need to create jobs here.\"</p> <p>According to Mayor Shadid, the aim of the summer takeover is \"to give the young people a chance to participate in civil society and more confidence to become part of the political system in the future\". Bashaer is \"doing a great job\", he says. She has \"charisma, a strong leadership personality \u2013 and people like her\".</p> <p>The teenager, who hopes her role as mayor will encourage more women to become actively involved in public life, plans to pursue a political career.</p> <p>But, first, she intends to study international issues at university following her final two years at school. The youngest of seven children, Bashaer says her family are supporting her unusual role this summer and her ambitions.</p>",
  "<p>Hackers have demonstrated support for Pussy Riot, defacing the website of the court that recently convicted the band. The group Anonymous Russia offered an unambiguous opinion on the punks' two-year sentencing, posting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-release-new-single-video\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot's new single</a> and declaring: \"Wake up, comrades!\"</p> <p>Khamovnichesky court's website was hijacked for about three hours on Tuesday, headed with the text: \"Putin's thieving gang is robbing our country!\" In addition to slogans such as \"Free Pussy Riot!\" and \"Judges \u2013 I'd have executed them all\", the hackers reportedly linked to a video by the Bulgarian singer Azis. This was a \"rather sleazy and erotic gay clip\", according to the Russian news website Gazeta.ru.</p> <p>Officials eventually regained control of the court's site, removing the cyber-vandalism. \"Specialists are working to determine how the hacking attack was carried out,\" Darya Lyakh, their press officer, told <a href=\"http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/08/21/the_website_of_the_moscow_khamovnichesky_court_website_has_resumed_w_17532.html\" title=\"\">Interfax</a>. \"The form of the hacking attack was chosen by people with bad imagination.\" The Russian interior ministry is considering an investigation into the hack, which was reportedly carried out by a Russian chapter of the hacking community Anonymous.</p> <p>\"Of course I do not approve of hacking attacks,\" said Mark Feygin, one of <a href=\"http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/anti-putin-hackers-seize-moscow-courts-web-site-posting-calls-to-free-pussy-riot/\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot's lawyers</a> (via the New York Times), \"but [I] cannot hide genuine admiration for the daredevils from Anonymous.

During the trial of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, balaclava-clad members of the group continued to speak out, condemning the government's actions.

  "<p>Understanding how a local council works \u2013 and explaining it to citizens \u2013 can be a real challenge. But in Stoke, we have taken a different approach this year to explaining how big decisions are made at the council, and how our citizens can influence them.</p> <p>Every year, our councillors produce a short report on work they have carried out as community councillors. In local government, this is called overview and scrutiny; the central government equivalent is the Commons select committee.</p> <p>We wanted to get away from long, wordy reports, producing instead a clear summary and segments that people could delve into. So, based on some inspiring examples, including <a href=\"http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">West Sussex</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Local Government Information Unit,</a> we sat down with a designer to try and explain how overview and scrutiny works and turn the information into an infogram.</p> <p>Putting this together was a real challenge, but it was great to work with someone who knows little or nothing about what you do. Designer John Lester created it, mainly with Quark Xpress, a bit of Macromedia Freehand and Photoshop.</p> <p>The infogram has three sections: background \u2013 understanding process of overview and scrutiny; activity -what councillors have been doing; and how to take part \u2013 for citizens.</p> <p>It is a pick and mix menu, so people can pursue their own interests. Some information, such as public spend, is new, while other data is a summary from our website, for example the BIG 5 Reviews and Petitions.</p> <p>The new graphic was included in the July 2012 edition of our monthly publication for citizens, <a href=\"http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/news/our-city/\" title=\"\">Our City</a>, as well as posted online alongside details about councillors, who welcomed the fresh summary approach.</p> <p>The future? We will use the infographic in workshops to support some of our free for all 'Who Makes the Big Decisions' training open to schools, community groups, businesses and individuals as well as councillor development programme. It will help councillors explain aspects of their work to communities. We will look to use infographics in other aspects of our work in helping to promote understanding and involvement in how councils work.</p> <p><em>John Ross is overview and scrutiny manager, member services, business service directorate, Stoke-on-Trent city council</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>One fugitive from justice fights for human rights, the other for those of animals. Both have long histories of confronting governments and legions of passionate supporters. And now both have skipped bail in foreign countries to avoid extradition to much more powerful nations which they believe want to try them for political reasons. But the similarities between WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and Paul Watson, charismatic founder of radical marine enforcement organisation <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/\" title=\"\">Sea Shepherd</a>, end there.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-us-war-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">Assange is holed up very publicly in the Ecuadorean embassy in London</a> to avoid being sent back to Sweden where he faces questioning on sexual assault charges but fears he will be extradited to the US.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/26/paul-watson-skips-bail-germany\" title=\"\">Watson has disappeared after skipping bail in Germany in the face of allegations by Costa Rica</a> \u2013 strongly denied by Watson \u2013 that he endangered the lives of some of its shark finners back in 2002. The Canadian-born environmentalist who co-founded Greenpeace and has waged a 40 years' war against illegal fishing and marine destruction faced extradition requests from both Costa Rica and Japan, against whom Sea Shepherd have waged a long and bitter war over whales in the Antarctic.</p> <p>But where is Captain Watson? This week I left messages around the world for him in an attempt to invite him to write a piece for the Guardian. Oliver Wallasch, his lawyer in Germany was not taking calls, nor was the European director of Sea Shepherd. The organisation's US HQ in California referred me to <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2012/08/11/setting-the-record-straight-on-paul-watsons-status-1425\" title=\"\">his legal status on their website</a>, and Watson himself was not answering his US or European phones.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the bridge of the Sea Shepherd flagship, the Steve Irwin, took a call as it steamed off the Western Australian coast but the message was clear: \"We have no idea where Captain Watson is.\" Only his PR company said they had been in contact with him in the past few weeks, receiving several emails from him. But they, too, said they had no idea where he was.</p> <p>The best bet is that Watson is at sea \u2013 his home. Last year he told me he only spent a few days a year on land, and his lawyer last month said that he felt he [Watson] thought he could be of more use to his clients \u2013 the whales and fish \u2013 on a ship than he could in a German or Japanese prison. But if he is not on the Steve Irwin, could he possibly be on either of Sea Shepherd's <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/the-fleet.html\" title=\"\">two other boats, the Brigitte Bardot and the Bob Barker</a>? Both are thought to be in Australian waters preparing, like the Steve Irwin, for a new anti-whaling campaign in the Antarctic against the Japanese, starting in December. Neither ship could be contacted but anyway, it seems unlikely he could have left Europe without the authorities noticing.</p> <p>So could he still be in Europe? The Guardian has been told that his daughter and the head of Sea Shepherd's European office had been seen in Amsterdam. But equally, it was claimed that he may be seeking political <a href=\"http://selvavidasinfronteras.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/the-amazon-pink-dolphins-voice-chilean-senator-juan-pablo-letelier-requested-to-accelerate-political-asylum-for-sea-shepherds-captain-paul-watson/\" title=\"\">asylum in Chile</a> through senator Juan Pablo Letelier, who, it appears, has been asked to \"accelerate political asylum for Watson\".</p> <p>Much more likely is that Captain Watson will apply for political asylum, like Assange, in Ecuador, where President Correa has a strong human rights record and where Sea Shepherd has a long history of working with the national police and the Gal\u00e1pagos to catch illegal fishers and apprehend the shark mafia. The organisation was in 2005 even granted the power to arrest people believed to be fishing illegally and in 2007 Sea Shepherd donated their old US coastguard boat to the marine national park. <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20070805&amp;id=1p8_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OlYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2994,5962434\" title=\"\">Although Correa once expelled Sea Shepherd's Ecuadorean representative, Sean O'Hearn</a>, relations were patched up and Watson has been very complimentary about Correa.</p> <p>The last hint that Ecuador may be the preferred destination of Watson is that he is known to be good friends with Mariana Almeida, head of Ecuador's vibrant Life Without Frontiers ecological foundation. In a letter to a US website, <a href=\"http://www.dallasblog.com/201207311009291/dallas-blog/international-environment-mission-letter-to-dallas-blog.html\" title=\"\">she recently wrote</a> with apparent knowledge of the legal case Watson's legal team may be expecting to pursue:</p> <blockquote> \"The case of Captain Watson would also be presented to the pertinent human rights commissions and organisations and shall be placed on the agenda of the European parliament, the international agreements shall be respected and it is clear that Germany might need to explain to the European parliament the reason to accept the extradition request from a Caribbean country without an extradition agreement.\" </blockquote> <p>It's not conclusive, but Watson needs all the friends on land that he has got right now. He has proved many times that he is the master of maritime law but whether he can now outwit an array of governments led by the powerful Japanese, may define the rest of his buccaneering life.</p>",
  "<h2>1) Up for the Cup</h2> <p>It is hard to think of a logical argument in favour of Leeds winning Saturday's Challenge Cup final \u2013 and avoiding the unwelcome precedent of becoming the first team to lose this showpiece game at Wembley three times running. They would have been underdogs anyway on league positions, having lost 10 fixtures out of 25 this season whereas Warrington have won 18 and lost only six, despite a rotation policy that has contributed to surprise defeats at Salford and, last weekend, London.</p> <p>But the loss of Danny McGuire, such an influential member of the Rhinos team \u2013 best seen recently in their shock semi-final win against Wigan \u2013 with a cruelly-timed knee injury has tilted the odds even more heavily in favour of the Wolves.</p> <p>Putting the mauling they received at The Stoop to one side, they seem to be approaching the business end of the season in terrific shape to make amends for the bitter disappointments of 2011, when they were dominant from February to August only to fall one match short of both Wembley and Old Trafford.</p> <p>I am still reluctant to write off Leeds completely. They have too many outstanding players and especially leaders, most obviously in Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock, who would both so richly deserve to taste a Wembley win so late in their careers. (The same would go for Rob Burrow and Jamie Jones-Buchanan, two other stalwarts of the most successful decade in the club's history.) They also have exciting back-line talent in Zak Hardaker, Ben Jones-Bishop, Ryan Hall and Kallum Watkins, who will surely relish Wembley's wide open spaces on a warm August afternoon.</p> <p>But Warrington are also well-endowed in those categories, with the experience of Lee Briers, Brett Hodgson, Michael Monaghan and Adrian Morley in midfield, and the pace of Chris Riley, Ryan Atkins and Stefan Ratchford out wide. I've also got a sneaking feeling that Wembley might be the stage for Richie Myler to confirm that his career is back on track, two years after he was excluded from Warrington's cup final team.</p> <p>That would be terrific news for British rugby league as a whole, as gifted half-backs remain a rare commodity. And that is my main hope for the final, that these two teams do themselves justice in a Saturday afternoon, terrestrial television showcase \u2013 as Wigan and Leeds did in last year's classic final, but as the Rhinos failed to do in folding so limply against the Wolves in 2010.</p> <h2>2) What the Effingham ...</h2> <p>Rugby league's Wembley weekend is about more than one match, however. It begins on Thursday at Odsal with <a href=\"http://www.therfl.co.uk/news/article/25968/schools-ready-for-champion-finals\" title=\"\">the Carnegie Champion Schools finals</a>, involving 14 teams from 10 different educational establishments \u2013 from Castleford, Manchester, Settle, Leeds, Widnes, Featherstone, Rochdale, Wakefield and Swansea.</p> <p>Then on Friday night the focus switches to north London, where the Skolars aim to climb into the play-off places in Championship One by beating Whitehaven at the New River Stadium, in a game that will be televised by Premier Sports.</p> <p>The last attraction before the main event is the Year Seven boys final that completes the Champion Schools programme, the traditional Wembley curtain-raiser for the Steven Mullaney Memorial Match, which features a classic clash between rugby league's tradition \u2013 Castleford Academy \u2013 and expansion, in the form of Howard of Effingham, from the outskirts of Guildford in Surrey. They have beaten teams from Essex, south Wales, Staffordshire and, finally, St Cuthbert's of St Helens to get there.</p> <p>Finally next Monday night, England play France in <a href=\"http://www.whatsonmedway.co.uk/whats-on-search/wheelchair-rugby-league-international-england-v-france-at-medway-park-p882531\" title=\"\">a wheelchair international at Medway Park, Gillingham</a> (more of which later).</p> <h2>3) Rea of light, or road to nowhere?</h2> <p>The focus is already on London, with stories emanating from the Broncos. Last Friday's 62-18 win against Warrington was comfortably their best of an underwhelming season, and all the more notable as it came with a team including seven products of their own development programme, despite the absence of two more likely southerners \u2013 Tony Clubb and Dan Sarginson \u2013 through injury. Now Tony Rea, who had initially returned from Australia in a purely temporary role to lead the search for a new coach for 2012, has agreed to stay on as head coach for next season \u2013 the club is in his blood, and he just couldn't help himself.</p> <p>That is great news for London, and for rugby league in general, but the rumours that the club will be on the move again next season, probably to Gillingham, is a trickier one to interpret. Moving out of town is not ideal, obviously. But if it is the only viable financial option, then at least Gillingham offers potential, largely thanks to the remarkable progress made by Martin Coyd and the other driving forces behind the Medway Dragons community club over the last few years. Those London rugby league stalwarts who are complaining so loudly, and understandably, about the move need a reality check \u2013 if Super League rugby in the capital is not financially viable, then surely this is better than nothing?</p> <h2>4) Super League \u2013 Sting in the tail</h2> <p>So much has happened at all levels of the game since the last Set of Six, for which apologies, but it has been a busy summer. Bradford's challenge for a top-eight place, despite the financial uncertainty that has cost them six points, has been a terrific story, and reflected huge credit on Mick Potter, Francis Cummins, the rest of their coaching staff and all the players. Can they do it? Possibly, but they still have two tough fixtures against Hull and the Catalans, and that could open the door for Wakefield Trinity, whose late-season surge has been equally stirring.</p> <p>Widnes are also showing welcome signs of life towards the bottom, scrapping with London and Castleford to avoid the wooden spoon \u2013 a battle which has plenty of resonance even in the absence of the threat of relegation. It is reassuringly tricky to find a meaningless fixture in the two remaining Super League rounds after the cup final, and I would love to be at the Stobart Stadium for Widnes's season-ending derby at home to Warrington.</p> <h2>5) Championships \u2013 daring to dream</h2> <p>There were also eyecatching results in the Championships last weekend, notably Leigh's home win against a Halifax team who recently won the Northern Rail Cup in such thrilling style, and a high-scoring draw between Sheffield Eagles and Featherstone.</p> <p>Down in Championship One, Doncaster are now shaping as favourites to finish top, which would be a terrific achievement for Tony Miller, Paul Cooke and everyone else at the Keepmoat. Workington's revival has also been heartening, but their surprise defeat at a much-improved Oldham last weekend means they will have to settle for a play-off place.</p> <p>But the Rugby Football League still need to give more thought to devising a divisional structure that convinces the latent support of all these clubs that there is a viable pathway to the top.</p> <h2>6) Robbie still a Bulls man</h2> <p>Finally, a quick word for the autobiography of <a href=\"http://www.gnbooks.co.uk/books/9781905080106.shtml\" title=\"\">Robbie Hunter-Paul, which will be published this Friday</a> \u2013 an appropriate date, given the importance of the classic 1996 Challenge Cup final in forging the reputation of the explosive and engaging Kiwi. As you would expect, Robbie has plenty of terrific stories to tell, and he does so entertainingly, helped by Chris Irvine of the Times. It will be an especially poignant read for the Bradford supporters who have had to endure so much uncertainty this season, but have rallied around their club so loyally \u2013 and I suspect are now enjoying themselves more than at any time since 2005, just as Wigan's flirtation with relegation in 2006 seemed to mark a turning point for the Warriors.</p> <p>There has been some talk recently about the Bulls needing a figurehead to lead their revival, just as Trevor Foster did back in the 1960s. The passion for the Bradford club that oozes from Robbie in his book makes me wonder whether he might be the perfect man.</p>",
  "<p>Large corporations today are increasingly accepting their role as social actors. With that comes certain responsibilities to society. Some of these are spelt out in legal statutes. Companies should not exploit their workforce, for instance, or pollute the environment. But are there responsibilities that stretch beyond the law? Should companies be held responsible for how their products are used, for instance?</p> <p>To think through these issues, Guardian Sustainable Business brought together experts from the academic, corporate, non-profit and business advisory sectors. At their keyboards for the online debate were: Dr Iain Black, lecturer in marketing at Edinburgh Business School; Karen Hamilton, vice-president, sustainability, consumer goods firm Unilever; Amanda Long, chief executive, consultancy firm Corporate Culture; Dax Lovegrove, head of business and industry relations, environment charity WWF-UK; Michael Maniates, professor of environmental science and political science, Allegheny College in the US; and Carmel Mcquaid, climate change manager, UK retailer M&amp;S. Here's a summary of the main themes:</p> <p><strong>Getting on the pitch</strong></p> <p>If you were to have asked a group of corporate representatives ten years ago about the 'social responsibility' of their firm, you could have bet on some predictable replies: 'Do no harm', 'obey the law', 'give to charity', 'create jobs', and variants thereof. The extent to which expectations have moved on came through powerfully throughout this online debate.</p> <p>None of the panellists defended a socially reductive vision of business as exclusively profit-maximising machines. From the start, the consensus among the panellists was that company responsibilities go beyond the factory gate. Unilever's Karen Hamilton summed it up as follows: should companies \"sit on the sidelines waiting \u2026 or get on the pitch and start addressing the issues?\" She favours the second.</p> <p>Other corporations now concur, maintained WWF's Dax Lovegrove: \"Many leading businesses accept this and are taking action. They see their responsibilities stretching across consumer use and disposal of products, where impacts are often at their highest.\"</p> <p><strong>A preference for partnership</strong></p> <p>So companies have entered the fray, but what are the rules and where do the boundaries lie? Again, Unilever's Hamilton put it succinctly: \"Once a company takes responsibility beyond the factory gates, the only way to work is in collaboration.\"</p> <p>Take deforestation. Forests are chopped down for all kinds of reasons, be it to procure timber, grow soya beans or some other trade-oriented activity. And ultimately trade involves buyers, sellers, regulators, producers and so forth. Only by bringing all parties together will progress be made. Unilever is therefore working with WWF to bring together the main players in the soya, palm oil, sugar and other commodity industries. Through partnership and dialogue, terms of responsible production are beginning to emerge.</p> <p>The implication is that companies have a responsibility to use the influence that their buying power gives them to convene and cajole others to act.</p> <p><strong>Spheres of influence, levels of impact</strong></p> <p>Some like to think of modern mega-corporations as all-powerful entities. They're not. Powerful, yes. But omnipotent, no. Behind the panellists' talk of partnership is an implicit acceptance that corporate influence stretches only so far. Businesses are not lone agents. They require others.</p> <p>All the same, questions of corporate power and influence were shown to be important and legitimate when considering the limits of companies' responsibility. It makes no sense to hold a business entirely responsible for a problem if its part in creating that problem is only partial. Likewise, responsibility \u2013 if it's to be meaningful \u2013 supposes a power for resolution.</p> <p>Effectively what companies do is make judgement calls. Carmel Mcquaid spelt out how this works in practice. M&amp;S, where she oversees the firm's climate change activities, \"hot-spotted\" its carbon footprint across the full value chain: that's to say, it identified where its impacts \u2013 and, therefore, its responsibilities - were highest. Energy use in its own factories was the only area directly under its control, and thus easiest to target. The climate impacts of producers making cotton and food, and of consumers washing clothes, were less direct. Even so, M&amp;S still has influence in these areas and a concomitant responsibility, as its efforts to encourage best practice farming methods and clothes care prove.</p> <p><strong>Stretching back towards suppliers</strong></p> <p>Resolving indirect impact requires the engagement of suppliers. A quarter of Unilever's total greenhouse gas emissions derive from its supply chain, Hamilton revealed. \"It is easier for business to influence its suppliers than to influence consumers\", she admitted frankly. Look no further than Walmart. The US retail giant announced a new sustainability plan a few years ago and, like it or not, its global network of suppliers had to get on board.</p> <p><strong>Reaching out to consumers</strong></p> <p>Companies need to look up their value chain too. Much of the debate revolved around consumer behaviour and company's responsibility for influencing it. The most obvious step is to take unsustainable products off the shelves. Companies are wary of this so-called \"choice editing\". It rankles our \"democratic sensibilities\", consumer theorist Michael Maniates wrote. Yet he and fellow academic Iain Black didn't think that mattered too much. Mostly that's because companies choice edit all the time already.</p> <p>\"The John Lewis partnership, for example, are quite explicit that this is their role\", pointed out Black. M&amp;S's Carmel Mcquaic admitted as much, observing that her company used to have a \"product selector\". If companies are already choosing certain products according to price, quality and value, why not add in a sustainability criterion too?</p> <p>The corporate panellists instinctively preferred alternative tactics to choice editing. Redesigning products, rather than scrapping them, was one option put forward. Hamilton cited <a href=\"http://www.nike.com/nikeos/p/gamechangers/en_US/considered\" title=\"\">Nike's Considered Design</a> approach as an illustrative example. A second option centred around influencing consumer behaviour. Corporate Culture's Amanda Long pointed to <a href=\"http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/about-us/EDCA9E86306447CD91E9169E4A427B7B.aspx\" title=\"\">Anglia Water's Love Every Drop</a> campaign.</p> <p>\"The key is in commitment to invest in well-targeted customer social marketing and then working on moving them to scale\", she argued. Unilever is trying to do that through its <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/mediacentre/pressreleases/2011/five-levers-change-111123.aspx\" title=\"\">Five Levers for Change</a> strategy.</p> <p>Getting people to change their habits ain't easy though. All the panellists agreed on that. Divergence came on what to do about it. Companies just need to get smarter in how they engage consumers, the corporate practitioners argued. The academics disagreed. Educating consumers on how to act isn't enough, they argued. Consumers need to be told.</p> <p>\"The most effective environmental initiatives over the past 20 years or so have come from business and government elites pushing change from the top\", said Michael Maniates.</p> <p><strong>Government standards</strong></p> <p>In practice, that involves coming up with specific sustainability principles and then delivering on them. Companies are beginning to do this at a voluntary level, observed Iain Black. But voluntarism isn't enough, he said. Consumers need reassurance that core principles are being adhered to. \"For this to happen, we need governments involved.\" Sure, companies may be responsible for influencing consumer behaviour. But someone else needs to be responsible for ensuring that they carry out this responsibility. And that someone else, Black argued, should be the state.</p> <p>To read the whole discussion, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/factory-gates-homes-business-responsibility\" title=\"\">please click here</a>.</p> <p><em>To see the full programme of discussions, </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/lets-talk-sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><em>please click here</em></a><em>, and to register for reminders, please complete the form below.</em></p> <p><em>This article forms part of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\" title=\"\"><em>Let's talk sustainable living</em></a><em>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making sustainable living mainstream.

  "<p>Motorbikers who flout the rules about riding on bridleways in the <a href=\"http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/\">Yorkshire Dales </a>national park have had a warning: an on-the-spot fine for one of a group who decided to have things their own way in <a href=\"http://www.yorkshire-dales.com/coverdale.html\">Coverdale</a>.</p> <p>The beautiful valley looks like the last place you might encounter a traffic cop or warden but Sergeant Stuart Grainger was in the right place at the right time, somewhat like PC Nick Rowan in <a href=\"http://www.nicholasrhea.co.uk/heartbeat/\"><em>Heartbeat</em></a>, albeit the latter's patch is the equally lovely North York Moors national park.</p> <p><em>A propos </em>of which, do you know how many national parks there are in our 'grim' north of England and can you name them all? Answers at the foot of this post.</p> <p>Anyway, Grainger spotted about eight bikers ignoring signs and riding up the bridle way from Horsehouse alongside High Gill towards Fleensop. He says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I got between some of them and stopped the last two going up. The others looked back and shot off up the bridleway.<br>&#xa0;<br>I ran after one of them and grabbed hold of his backpack but he kept pulling away and I chose to let go of him rather than him falling off the bike. However, another one got stuck further up the track so I brought him back down and issued him with a \u00a330 ticket for riding on a bridleway. </p> </blockquote> <p>Good action stuff; and although opinions can wax strong on this issue, it was a deserved penalty when the balance between all the various and sometimes competing groups who enjoy the Dales is so well-preserved and regularly discussed by the national park and its users. As Grainger says of the bridleway in question:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a clear sign showing a motorbike crossed out as you turn off the main road and another attached to the gate they had to open to proceed up the bridleway \u2013 so there was a clear prompt even if they claimed they didn't know the law concerning bridleways and footpaths. The rider I stopped was from the Richmond area, so they may all have been local too.</p> <p>Luckily there were no walkers using this narrow bridleway at the time, because had there been, they would have been put in danger by this group, or, at the very least, they would have found it intimidating and disruptive. I will be contacting local trail riding groups to ask them to remind members that bridleway and footpath use is illegal and damaging.<br>&#xa0;</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395034248\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/30/1322674641706/Passenger-Train-crossing--002.jpg\" alt=\"Passenger Train crossing the Ribblehead Railway Viaduct Settle Carlisle Leeds Line Yorkshire Dales\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ribblehead's famous rail viaduct on the Settle-Carlisle line.

But there are a few who think they are above the law and can go where they want, irrespective of the damage they may cause to the land and its wildlife.<br>&#xa0;<br>We work closely with the police to patrol bridleways and footpaths that are being used illegally and we would urge members of the public to help by reporting any incidents. It is illegal to ride a car or motorbike on any public footpath or bridleway so trail riders and 4x4 users are urged to make sure they know where they can legally drive away from the metalled road.

  "<p>There's a general consensus doing the rounds in industry that if we're not careful we could quite quickly talk ourselves into another recession.</p> <p>This isn't my opinion, but the actual thoughts of thousands of manufacturing SMEs who talk to our advisers every day \u2013 in other words, the people at the coalface of our sector.</p> <p>Recent forecasts have told a sorry story of PMI figures dipping, export sales dropping and, worse still, the spectre of a painful double dip recession. The reality is somewhat different.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mymas.org/news/mas-barometer-shows-2018growth2019-still-there-for-english-manufacturers\">Results from the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS) national barometer </a>show that 53% of firms have increased turnover in the past six months, with the same number expecting an upturn in sales between now and the end of the year.</p> <p>Equally impressive, is that more than a third of manufacturing SMEs are looking to recruit and 71% of the 719 respondents questioned believe they will boost export turnover by late 2013. So much for a downturn, you might think?</p> <p>The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle, with increased enquiry levels and investment in premises and machinery both down from the previous barometer.</p> <p>Our role at MAS is to help SME manufacturers grow by giving them access to tailored advice, practical hands-on support and make them aware of relevant funding opportunities.</p> <p>We primarily do this by mobilising a team of 85 experienced advisers to work on-the-ground with companies all over England, developing strategy, new product introductions, export drives and world class manufacturing processes.</p> <p>This gives us an excellent insight into current and future trends, and the anecdotal information we are seeing firsthand currently backs up the signs of growth revealed in the barometer.</p> <p>Manufacturers are saying they are benefiting from the unprecedented \u00a34.5bn of investment flowing into the UK automotive industry. Others have been able to attract new customers through advanced engineering, innovation and world-leading low carbon expertise.</p> <p>The common thread among these stories is that SMEs have been proactive in winning this work. And this hasn't been a scattergun approach, quite the reverse.</p> <p>In today's competitive environment you need a more structured plan to target new markets, both at home and abroad, and you need to be prepared to invest to make it happen.</p> <p>This could be in new marketing material, attending trade shows, developing social media strategies or even funding the necessary R&amp;D required to take core competencies and apply them to complementary industries.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bscdiecasting.co.uk\" title=\"\">BSC (Diecasting)</a> is a perfect example of this in practice. The zinc and aluminium pressure diecaster has more than doubled its turnover since 2009, creating 20 new jobs in the process.</p> <p>When the management team embarked on this growth push they made a concerted effort to invest in new machinery, the skills of their staff and, importantly, re-branding and running a PR campaign. They 'talk the talk as well as walk the walk'.</p> <p>They also made no excuses for being a UK manufacturer \u2013 in fact they made a virtue of it and new orders soon followed \u2013 from the brewing, hydraulics and automotive sectors.</p> <h2>Exports</h2> <p>The specialist focus for this quarter's barometer was export and the results were even more impressive than many experts would have predicted.</p> <p>More than 70% of respondents believe they will increase overseas sales in the next 18 months, with one in 10 expecting turnover to increase by 50%.</p> <p>The appetite is there, but it's not without its issues. Around 40% see generating sales as their biggest challenge, followed by selecting the right agent or distributor (17%) and fluctuating exchange rates (13%).</p> <p>The latter is a game of chess that any company will find difficult to control, but there is support out there for winning work and negotiating your way through the maze that is finding someone to represent you in international markets.</p> <p>UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) is a fantastic resource that firms can take advantage of regardless of their level of export experience and the UK is well equipped with a network of embassies that offer great contacts and on-the-ground 'know-how'.</p> <p>At MAS, we are in the perfect position to help with the actual manufacturing challenges of exporting also revealed in the survey. The main threats causing management teams sleepless nights were competitive production costs (50%) and meeting international standards (14%).</p> <p>These are both business areas we've been helping SMEs with for almost 10 years by undertaking a business review and then developing an action plan to help them address key needs.</p> <p>Exporting is always a delicate subject for any company. It can be a big risk and if done without the right approach can sometimes be fatal.</p> <p>However, prepare well, identify your strengths and tap into the support on offer and it could well be the best business decision you ever make.</p> <p><em>David Caddle is area director for the </em><a href=\"http://www.mymas.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Manufacturing Advisory Service</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Everyone has a foodie fantasy and mine goes like this: I would love to live in a world where when the clock strikes four \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGQASun9d8E\">everything stops for tea</a>\". The old song conjures up a world of pantries and buttered toast, witticisms and bons mots traded over bakewell tart and freshly brewed Darjeeling, with Cole Porter tinkling on the piano.</p> <p>Naffness aside, when it comes to afternoon tea I am defiantly old-school. I have raised my little finger from <a href=\"http://www.claridges.co.uk/london-mayfair-afternoon-tea.aspx\">Claridges</a> in London to <a href=\"http://www.bettys.co.uk/afternoon_tea.aspx\">Bettys</a> in Harrogate. The <a href=\"http://www.theritzlondon.com/tea/\">champagne tea at the Ritz</a> was practically a spiritual experience for me.</p> <p>I'm not quite sure what to make of its latest incarnation, the \"gentleman's afternoon tea\". Up and down the country the traditional afternoon tea has somehow been deemed too ladylike for gentlemen. Instead, starched napkins are being smoothed down in preparation for mini fish and chips, black pudding, pork pies, scotch eggs and \"rustic\" chunky sandwiches with crusts defiantly on, presumably washed down with a vat of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2012/06/will-self-why-i-hate-builders-tea\">builders' tea</a>.</p> <p>So, less Noel Coward and more Stan Ogden then, proving once more that gender stereotypes are alive and kicking in the world of catering. Forget dainty finger sandwiches and lemon drizzle cake on fine bone china, this food so closely resembles something you might scarf at midnight after a few drinks that I'm half surprised nobody's chucked in a doner kebab as well.<br><br>At the <a href=\"http://www.chestergrosvenor.com/\">Chester Grosvenor</a> (in Chester) you can scoff \"crusty doorstep\" sarnies and \"chunky chips\". The <a href=\"http://www.radissonblu-edwardian.com/manchester-hotel-gb-m2-5gp/gbmanche/hotel/dining/opus\">Opus One</a> restaurant at the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel in Manchester forgo the cucumber sandwiches for mini fish and chips, mushy peas (which they're calling \"Manchester caviar\"), mini pork pies, mini Yorkshire puddings with beef and gravy, rustic sandwiches, scones and beer.</p> <p>Most of these menus pay homage to all things beefy and mustardy, because that's what boys like to eat, right? Well, to be fair, some do and many more would balk at spending \u00a340-50 on mimsy cakes, diminutive butties and a stodgy scone or two. Throw in (deep breath) poached oysters with bloody mary relish, seared steak, lamb and potato hotpots, mini beef burgers with mustard seed relish, rabbit and pancetta pasties, as they do at <a href=\"http://www.sanctumsoho.com\">Sanctum Soho</a> in London, followed, somewhat bizarrely, with \"a tankard of Jack Daniels\" and a cigar, and - wa-hey \u2013 now you're talking.</p> <p>My biggest gripe with this invention though is that it just isn't afternoon tea. According to <a href=\"http://www.mrsbeeton.com\">Mrs Beeton</a>, finger sandwiches for an afternoon repast should be \"dainty trifles, pleasing to the eye and palate\" and served with a collection of other delicate fancies such as melt-in-the-mouth macaroons, buttery shortbread, and fruity tea buns laced with spices. These gentlemen's affairs are really \"high tea\", a proper filling meal dished up on the kitchen (high) table after a day's work \u2013 tea, bread and butter, cakes or scones, hot, hearty foods such as rarebit and pasties and possibly cold cuts of meat.</p> <p>Are men really too butch for cake? Isn't this all a bit Yorkie-ad retrogressive? Granted, afternoon tea was supposedly invented by a woman: Anna Russell, Duchess of Bedford is widely credited for its rise in 1842 when due to the long gap between a light luncheon at noon and the typical eight o'clock dinner, she got a rather inelegant case of the munchies. The habit slowly spread through polite society.</p> <p>So in those early days was it chiefly a ladies' thing, with men making an occasional appearance? Yes, says food historian <a href=\"http://www.anniegray.co.uk/\">Annie Gray</a>, whose fascinating research shows it was the place where women negotiated their status and built alliances and friendships. By the 1870s, the occasion was drawing middle class women out of the home, where they could quaff their Earl Grey together in newly-flourishing tea houses, which, says Gray, eventually led to the suffragette movement.</p> <p>Nowadays, afternoon tea is a mainstay of the heritage trade, but that doesn't mean there isn't <a href=\"http://www.lovefood.com/journal/opinions/14656/unusual-afternoon-teas\">room for innovation</a> \u2013 the Merrion Hotel in Dublin do a fabulous <a href=\"http://www.merrionhotel.com/page.php?pid=241\">Art Tea</a> with cakes inspired by artists Jack Yeats, John Boyd and Louis le Brocquy while the Berkeley's \"<a href=\"http://www.the-berkeley.co.uk/fashionista_tea.aspx\">fashionista teas</a>\" in London are equally eccentric.

His decision to stay on will be viewed with dismay by senior members of the Republican party.</p> <p>Speaking live on the Mike Huckabee radio show on Tuesday, Akin said that he had received a large amount of support from small, grassroots supporters, including donations, and this helped counter-balance withdrawal of support from Republican leaders. \"I just misspoke one word in one sentence on one day,\" Akin said. Akin had claimed women's bodies can prevent pregnancies in cases of \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>An unusual coalition of senior and grassroots Republicans has been making a concerted effort to get him to quit, including Tea Party groups, some of which helped Akin secure victory in the primary last week.</p> <p>Under state election law, Akin would have faced no financial penalties if he had pulled out by 6pm ET on Tuesday, and the party would be free to pick an alternative. The next date for withdrawal would be 25 September, but that would require a court order to allow him leave the race. </p> <p>Leaving it until September could also mean he would face significant financial penalties, such as reimbursing the cost of reprinting ballot papers or other election material.</p> <p>But the Republicans' difficulties on abortion are unlikely to go away. On Tuesday, as the leadership turned up the heat on Akin, the party approved language in its platform calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with no explicit exemptions in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another Republican congressman, Steve King of Iowa, inflamed the row, defending Akin and suggesting that he'd never heard of a woman getting pregnant from statutory rape or incest. </p> <p><a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/steve-king-statutory-rape.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> on Monday reported that King told Iowa radio station KMEG-TV reported him saying: \"Well I just haven't heard of that being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter.\" </p> <p>The controversy has also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/paul-ryan-pro-life-akin\">focused attention on the anti-abortion views</a> of Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. </p> <p>The Missouri seat held by McCaskill is regarded by Republicans as the top target in the campaign to take control of the Senate. McCaskill, who has used the row to portray Akin as an extremist, is urging him to stay in the race. </p> <p>The Republican Senate campaign committee and conservative Super Pacs have withdrawn about $10m in financial support for Akin. The last remaining hope for Akin is to attract donations from individual donors. </p> <p>If Akin eventually quits, he could be replaced either by Jim Brunner, a businessman who came second in the primary with 30% \u2013 6% behind Akin \u2013 or Sarah Steelman, a former state treasurer, who took 29%. Brunner has already been sounding out party members about replacing Akin.</p> <p>Public Policy Polling, in a survey conducted on Monday night, showed the row has not had any significant impact on voting intentions yet. Akin is leading McCaskill 44% to 43%, almost unchanged from May when he was ahead 45% to 44%.</p> <p>It may be that the poll was conducted too soon to fully register any unease with Akin.</p> <p>As well as possible repercussions for the Senate race, Democrats also see Akin as useful in highlighting differences between the Obama-Biden ticket and the Romney-Ryan ticket on abortion. </p> <p>In the light of the row, there will be pressure to change the draft to include exceptions for rape and incest.</p>",
  "<p>I must have made a mistake. This is my first thought when the price of my booking at the Saban guesthouse in Olympos, Turkey, appears on my screen. I re-enter the details: two people, nine nights' half-board accommodation. The price flashes up again: \u00a399 per person. Admittedly, I am not travelling in the peak season (although it's only slightly more in the summer months) and the price is for \"treehouse\"-style accommodation, which from the photo looks like a shed on stilts, but I've stayed in shabbier looking dormitories that cost more. Plus the dormitories didn't come with two meals a day and what local guidebooks describe as some of the best food in Turkey. I check the reviews on TripAdvisor. All good. I check the weather report: guaranteed sunshine 300 days a year. A quick search on Skyscanner for flights to Antalya and I'm good to go.</p> <p>The ancient city of Olympos is an original Lycian settlement dating from 300BC that stretches along the southern Turkish coast. Protected by conservation laws that ban the use of concrete, Olympos is devoid of large-scale development and mass tourism. Over the last 20 or so years a village of around 20 wooden <em>pansiyons</em> (treehouse lodges) offering backpacker-style accommodation has sprung up.</p> <p>In contrast to its noisier neighbouring lodges, such as the Turkman and Bayrams, whose young guests can often be heard partying into the early hours, the Saban is known for its calmer, family atmosphere and quality food. The Saban opened 22 years ago when there were only three other pansiyons in the village. It has grown too \u2013 from three treehouses and a camping area to more than 20 treehouses, a 12-bed dormitory and several ensuite bungalows.</p> <p>We are met by Meral, whose parents opened the Saban when she was 12. Now in her thirties and with four generations of her family living on site, Meral runs the show with her two brothers Ali and Mustapha.</p> <p>\"I love my job,\" says Meral. \"I've only left Olympos twice in my life. Why do I need to go anywhere else? I have everything I need here. The sun, the food, the sea. I prefer to let the people come to me.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395029885\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/22/1345623729935/Saban-Olympos-Turkey-008.jpg\" alt=\"Saban, Olympos, Turkey\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hard day's chilling at Saban</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Charsley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Meral shows us to our accommodation, we realise there has been a mistake. A mix-up with our booking means we have been upgraded from a treehouse to a bungalow equipped with three single beds, air-con and ensuite shower-room (so small that one's top-to-toe cleaning routine can be executed while sitting on the toilet). But given what we were expecting, it feels like we've been upgraded to the honeymoon suite at the Hilton.</p> <p>Meral takes us for a stroll through Saban's gardens, along a pathway lined with dill, mint, rosemary, bay leaves and basil. There are pomegranates, lemons, oranges, grapes, mulberries, nectarines and plums. Meral picks some mulberries for us to try and a handful of mint for a guest who likes it added to his evening G&amp;T. By the time we arrive at the bar, we're so heady with the heat and aromas that it only takes one shot of raki to send us spinning back to our bungalow so we can wake in time for breakfast.</p> <p>The next day, we head to the beach with some fellow guests. Getting to the beach, recognised as one of the best in Turkey, is an adventure in itself.&#xa0; We follow a dusty road to the end of the pansiyons where an ancient winding path begins, leading to the sea. A river shaded by oleander and fig trees runs alongside. On the way we pass the ruins that line both banks of the stream, including two Lycian tombs with epigraphs translated for visitors.</p> <p>The pebble beach has hardly any shade to escape the blistering heat, so it's a relief to slip into the sea.</p> <p>If breakfast at Saban can be repetitive \u2013 watermelon, feta, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, along with an omelette cooked to your requirements by Saffi the smiling chef \u2013 dinner more than compensates: spicy clay-pot chicken casseroles, baked aubergines and peppers stuffed with lemon and mint couscous, meat <em>b\u00f6reks</em> (rich-filled pastries), Turkish ravioli, grilled vegetables bathed in yoghurt and house favourites: courgette and dill frittatas, and cheese-filled pastry \"cigarettes\". Fresh bread, salad and homemade soup, accompany every meal. Most of the fruit and veg is grown at the property, which is also home to free range chickens. The rest, along with all the meat and fish, is sourced from the nearby town of Kumluca.</p> <p>We return to the beach late that night to swim among the phosphorescence. As we move about stimulating the plankton, stars shoot from our bodies. While we create miniature galaxies beneath the sea's surface, above us real shooting stars splice through a dramatic Milky Way.</p> <p>The highlight of our holiday is a trip to the Chimaera, a series of eternal flames issuing from the hillsides of the Tahtali Dag (Mount Olympos). Burning for thousands of years, these inextinguishable natural gas flames are named after a mythological fire-breathing creature, which inhabited the mountains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395029886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345559880700/One-of-the-Chimaera-008.jpg\" alt=\"One of the Chimaera\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Chimaera on Mount Olympos.

Setting off at dusk allows us to take in the sights of the neighbouring agricultural village of \u00c7irali. Quieter but more developed than Olympos, \u00c7irali tends to attract an older crowd and families. About an hour's stroll on from \u00c7irali we reach the foothills of the Tahtali Dag and begin a 20-minute climb through forest up a well-trodden but steep and tricky path.</p> <p>As flames leap and dance from the glowing rocks, it's easy to imagine how they once conjured the legend of a fire-breathing monster.&#xa0;We find an unattended flame to huddle around, and admire our surroundings. At a nearby flame a family are preparing their evening meal, using the fire as a barbeque. Below us, a group of teenagers try to reignite a gas source with burning sticks, shrieking as the flame catches and billows towards them. From our high position the view across the valley and out to sea is made even more spectacular by a setting sun, as red as the Chimaera themselves. We stay well after darkness falls and it takes great effort to drag ourselves away.</p> <p>We return to the Saban guided by a full moon and the sound of chirruping insects.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.sabanpansion.com/indexen.php\" title=\"\"><em>sabanpansion.com/indexen.php</em></a><em>, dorms from 25TL (\u00a39) per person, treehouses \u00a310.50pp, bungalows \u00a314pp, including breakfast and dinner</em></p>",
  "<p>This year's graduates are shunning decent salaries, bonus potential and employee benefits in favour of more altruistic aims, according to research.</p> <p>Graduates are placing less importance on overall earnings and benefits than in 2011, with fewer than one in 10 (8%) saying a basic salary is in their top three considerations when applying for a job. This contrasts with almost half (45%) in 2011, according to research from management consulting firm <a href=\"http://www.haygroup.com/uk/\" title=\"\">Hay Group</a>, exclusive to the Guardian.</p> <p>Instead, graduates are increasingly interested in their ability to make a difference, with 51% naming this as a key factor in their job choice compared to just 4% in 2011.</p> <p>\"There is a perception that all graduate jobs are difficult to get, so you may as well strive for one that will make you feel happy and satisfied, rather than one that makes you feel bad, like working for an 'evil corporate',\" said Tanya de Grunwald, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Get-Graduate-Job-Recession/dp/1471642348/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345460625&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"Amazon: How to Get a Graduate Job in a Recession\">How to Get a Graduate Job in a Recession</a>. \"Graduates are not prepared to abandon their principles just because the economy is in a terrible state.\"</p> <p>Martin Allison applied to the Marks &amp; Spencer IT graduate scheme while studying a business studies degree at Glasgow Caledonian University. \"You're given exposure to all aspects of the business as well as the chance to be involved in meaningful projects,\" he said. \"Obviously not everything changes the world, but often you'll get a real sense of pride knowing that something you've done has a bearing.\"</p> <p>But the research, a snapshot of sentiment based on interviews with 600 graduates who have applied for a scheme, indicates that finding work is more difficult than it was last year.</p> <p>Just 29% of respondents said they had won a place on a graduate scheme, meaning that for every three or four graduate scheme applications only one is successful.</p> <p>Christopher Smith of Hay Group said: \"There is clearly a gap between graduates' perceptions of the job market and the reality. Although the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/july-2012/index.html\" title=\"ONS: Labour Market Statistics, July 2012\">latest labour market statistics</a> showed unemployment has started to drop and pay has increased slightly, there is still a very gloomy perception of the UK job market.</p> <p>\"Our research suggests this is starting to filter down and is affecting graduates' confidence.\"</p> <p>De Grunwald described the mood among recent graduates as \"pretty grim\". She said: \"I am concerned it is forcing them to make bad decisions \u2013 in particular, too many are signing up for expensive master's degrees simply to delay joining the workforce for another year, but without really knowing whether the qualification is a wise investment or truly valued by employers in their chosen field.\"</p> <p>A July 2012 study by <a href=\"http://www.highfliers.co.uk/download/GMReport12.pdf\" title=\"High Fliers Research: The Graduate Market in 2012 (PDF)\">High Fliers Research</a> showed that applications to graduate employers are 25% higher than three years ago, as advertised positions attract graduates from previous years as well as the latest cohort. The study showed there is an average of 73 students for each job, rising to 142 in the investment banking world and 154 in the retail sector.</p> <p>For Tessa Watts, finding a graduate job is proving a challenge. Since graduating with a law degree from the University of Exeter in 2011 she has applied to a number of graduate training schemes at major law firms without success.</p> <p>\"I do feel like it's only a matter of time before I get on a scheme, but law firms can cherry-pick at the moment: one big international firm recently selected just 15 graduates from 2,500 applications,\" she said. \"I'm really pleased even if I make it to the first round.\"</p> <p>Watts recently had four rejections in a single day. \"It can be dispiriting and demoralising. You have to be the one person who shines out from 100 applications or more. I'm not sure what I would do if I didn't have a fantastic support network of family and friends. None of my closest friends who studied law have remained in the sector, they have switched careers already.\"</p> <p>However de Grunwald said there is work for graduates beyond the traditional milkround employers. \"Graduates who take the time to do a bit more sleuthing will find vacancies that their friends will never even know about. Think about it \u2013 would you rather go for a job that 1,000 people have applied for, or 10?\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is to unveil a series of measures to promote jobs and growth as ministers move to show they have a credible economic strategy after a slump in corporate tax receipts led to higher than expected borrowing last month.</p> <p>As fears grow among senior figures in both coalition parties that George Osborne is running out of time to meet his pledge to stabilise the public finances, Whitehall sources have spoken of a co-ordinated growth push in September. There will be a particular focus on liberalising planning laws, guaranteeing more housebuilding and boosting infrastructure projects as Osborne prepares to deliver a crucial autumn statement in November that could presage even deeper spending cuts.</p> <p>The moves come as the Institute of Directors warns that the government is doing \"too little, too slowly\" to promote growth. Graham Leach, chief economist at the IoD, called on the government to do more to cut red tape and simplify employment law as a survey found that business leaders were \"battening down the hatches\" amid fears of a prolonged recession.</p> <p>In a sign of the government's radical thinking, ministers are drawing up plans to reform the Highways Agency so it can borrow money to pay for a \"horizon shift\" in spending on roads to boost the economy and reduce congestion and delays. </p> <p>The agency, which runs the network of motorways and A-roads, could be made more independent, most probably as a government-owned company or public trust, so it can borrow without increasing the public deficit. \"We have already made a lot of growth announcements,\" one government source said. \"But obviously the garden needs watering often.\"</p> <p>The moves to burnish the government's pro-growth approach came as a sharp fall in tax receipts last month led to a \u00a3557m deficit in public sector net borrowing. This compared with a \u00a32.8bn surplus in the same month last year and was way below the \u00a32.5bn surplus expected by analysts.</p> <p>The Treasury blamed a cut in North Sea oil and gas production after a fire at the Elgin platform deprived the exchequer of around \u00a31bn in tax receipts. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that Osborne may fail to meet the forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that borrowing will fall from \u00a3125bn last year to \u00a3122bn this year.</p> <p>The borrowing increase sparked unease in both coalition parties. Lord Oakeshott, the former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, said: \"How much more evidence do we need that boy soldiers firing pop guns at our recession won't work? Now we need two big bazookas - making the banks lend, with RBS nationalised, and building 100,000 more houses a year, led by desperately needed social housebuilding.\"</p> <p>From the right, the former Tory cabinet minister John Redwood called for tax cuts and spending cuts after the OBS figures showed government spending in July grew by 5.1% on the previous year, mostly on welfare payments.</p> <p>Treasury sources said the increase in borrowing was largely explained by the fall in corporation tax receipts, 75% of which was due to a drop in North Sea revenues. They pointed out that the main sources of tax revenue - VAT, income tax and national insurance - are on track or ahead of forecasts.</p> <p>\"It is a difficult environment because the global economy is weak,\" one source said. \"We have to hold our nerve and stick to our plan.\" Osborne will be waiting to hear whether the OBR decides the fall in tax receipts is temporary, cyclical, or structural. \"If it is permanent, there will be adjustments,\" a Treasury source said.</p> <p>The chancellor may have to extend planned spending cuts beyond the extra two years announced last year. He may also embrace deeper cuts, including an extra \u00a310bn in welfare spending reductions. This will not amount to a rewriting of the chancellor's \"fiscal mandate\" on the deficit because this is assessed on a rolling five-year basis, which means that no definitive judgment ever needs to be made. </p> <p>If the OBR decides that the fall in tax receipts is permanent, the chancellor could run into trouble on the second part of his mandate - ensuring that debt as a share of GDP is falling by 2015-16.</p> <p>Labour said the increase in borrowing showed the chancellor's strategy was failing. Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"This is a damning indictment of a chancellor who promised to secure the recovery and get the deficit down. His failed plan has delivered the exact opposite - a double-dip recession which is leading to soaring borrowing.\"</p> <p>The government will take the first steps in outlining its latest plans to promote growth tomorrow when it publishes a report on housing by Sir Adrian Montague. This is expected to say the government needs to lend publicly owned land to developers and relax requirements for building schemes to include social housing. Housing will be at the top of the list of growth announcements next month as ministers outline a guarantee on housebuilding. Planning laws will be liberalised, though Tory sources said there would be no threat to the green belt.</p> <p>The plans to reform highways funding, proposed by David Cameron in March, are part of longer-term thinking. A key reform will be in funding a new body to pay for ongoing operations and service its debts.</p> <p>Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"It's clear that ministers are now casting around for anything that might produce growth without thinking of the long-term consequences or value for money for taxpayers.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1902, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frederic_Still\" title=\"\">George Still</a>, the father of British paediatrics, gave one of the earliest descriptions of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), calling it a \"moral defect without general impairment of intellect\" characterised by an \"abnormal incapacity for sustained attention\".</p> <p>While the second part remains largely true, causal theories have moved on from descriptions of a \"moral defect\". Brain imaging studies in particular have shown that there are structural and functional changes that underpin ADHD symptoms, and in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22560046\" title=\"\">a paper published last month in the journal Biological Psychiatry</a>, a group at the Institute for Disorders of Impulse and Attention in the University of Southampton assess one of the newest ways of studying ADHD \u2013 by coupling brain imaging with neuroeconomics. They speculate that the condition may be associated with \"suboptimal\" economic decisions.</p> <p>At its core, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21550365\" title=\"\">neuroeconomics attempts to understand the neural basis of economic decision making</a>. All economic decisions involve an infinitely complicated set of interacting networks in the brain that adjust and implement plans that are aimed at securing a desired outcome. In children with ADHD, decision making is often compromised because they cannot wait for a reward \u2013 a phenomenon known as \"delay aversion\".</p> <p>This means that a smaller reward, received now, is often preferred over a more substantial reward in the future. Brain imaging studies have found that ADHD children have a hypersensitivity to delay that often translates into a desire to receive a reward as quickly as possible.</p> <p>An attention network that lies in the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain also seems to be underactive in ADHD children. Treatment with the drug Ritalin can increase activity in a structure that lies at the heart of this network \u2013 the dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex. This can ramp up activity in the attention network and increase the brain's ability to tolerate a delay before it receives a reward.</p> <p>In a resting state, when we let our minds wander, another very interesting network called the default mode network appears to motor along in the background. First discovered in 1995 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21713118\" title=\"\">by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin</a>, the default mode network is not only active during introspection and day-dreaming, but also deactivates as soon as we begin to attend to a task that requires a bit of serious thinking.</p> <p>In ADHD children, however, the default mode network does not seem to cut out when it should, so when they switch to a task that requires focused thought, the default mode network's activity can interfere with concentration.</p> <p>Money, attractive faces and appetising foods consistently activate a third brain network that deals with rewards: the frontostriatal network. This network weighs up the pros and cons of different choices and when it malfunctions there is a reduced ability to link rewards with actions. Memory is also important here as the brain must be able to hold different alternatives in mind so that it can fully explore the implications of different choices.</p> <p>Children with ADHD have difficulty holding different choices in mind, which in turn leads to poorer decision making. Research has shown that children with ADHD have a reduced concentration of dopamine receptors in this reward network. Again, drug treatment can help to boost its activity and improve the brain's ability to consider different choices before it makes a decision.</p> <p>But the story of ADHD is not all negative \u2013 there must be good evolutionary reasons for retaining ADHD traits in the population. Some of the positive aspects of ADHD include increased creativity and novel problem-solving abilities. Evolution needs variability and new avenues, and it is possible that those with ADHD will seek directions that would otherwise remain unexplored.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/173/abstract\" title=\"\">interesting genetic study of a Kenyan tribe</a>, researchers at Northwestern University in the US looked at the DRD4 7R gene, which has been linked with ADHD and novelty seeking. Only people with this ADHD-related gene were studied, but one group had recently settled into a community while a second group remained nomadic.</p> <p>The nomads with the ADHD-related gene were found to have a higher <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/\" title=\"\">body mass index</a> than their settled counterparts with the gene. Novelty-seeking and increased impulsivity may have helped the nomads to obtain food. The researchers also suggested that the shorter attention span conferred by the DRD4 7R gene might help nomadic children to learn more efficiently in a rapidly changing outdoor environment.</p> <p>In contrast, a similar attention span in the settled children would interfere with their learning in school. So the DRD4 7R gene may be more suitable for a nomadic lifestyle and less suitable for the sustained attention needed to make a living buying and selling goods in a village or town market place.</p> <p>All of which raises some interesting prospects for expanding these kinds of studies into the field of trading and banking for a more precise look at the neural goings-on behind some of our more spectacular financial failures.</p> <p>So what was once vaguely described in a fit of hand-waving as \"a moral defect\" is now being understood in ever more sophisticated ways as a dysfunction of many different brain networks that control decision making, memory and goal setting. As neuroeconomic and brain imaging tools shed more light on ADHD, a more subtle understanding of its symptomatology will also be vital for developing new treatments.</p>",
  "<p>'Run a successful business, change the world' is the message behind a comprehensive new practical <a href=\"http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/publicdownloads/setupaworkerscoop-lowres.pdf\" title=\"\">guide to setting up a workers' co-operative</a> from the activist network <a href=\"http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Radical Routes</a>.</p> <p>The publication, a distillation of many years' experience from within the workers' co-op movement, is appropriately enough a collective editorial effort. \"With this handbook we want to inspire you to work co-operatively, to take control over your work life and change our society for the better,\" say the authors. Workers' co-ops provide meaningful employment and benefits for their communities, rather than just generating profits for bosses or unconnected shareholders, they add.</p> <p>Cath Muller from the Leeds-based print co-op <a href=\"http://www.footprinters.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Footprint</a>, one of the members of the working group which produced the handbook, senses a new wave of interest in workers' co-operatives which she links to recent grassroots activism around issues and campaigns such as transition towns, climate change and locally-sourced food. \"People are having an in-depth political discussion about the nature of capital and the nature of work, with a view to building something different,\" she says. There's a desire, as she puts it, to grab part of the economy and reshape it in a cooperative way.</p> <p>It's a view which Stuart Field of <a href=\"http://www.alternativechoices.info/\" title=\"\">Alternative Choices</a> shares. A long-time active participant in Radical Routes, he points to the success of the sessions on running workers' cooperatives which were held last year on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral as part of the Occupy movement's actions. This interest, he says, is reflected in the high numbers (often over a hundred) who attend the quarterly Gatherings of the Radical Routes network, weekend meetings of active members of housing and workers' cooperatives which have been taking place since the late 1980s. The <a href=\"http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/the-next-gathering.html\" title=\"\">next Gathering</a> takes place later this month [17-19 August] at a housing co-op in rural Shropshire.</p> <p>One of the workers' co-operatives active in Radical Routes is <a href=\"http://birminghambikefoundry.org/home.html\" title=\"\">Birmingham Bike Foundry</a>, set up two years ago and now operating from shop premises in Stirchley. The co-op sources and sells second-hand bikes and bike parts, undertakes bike repairs and also runs bike maintenance and cycling training courses, with the dual aim of promoting the social and environmental benefits of cycling and of providing its four co-op members (all in their mid- to late-20s) with employment where there is no boss in charge.</p> <p>There's a strong radical and anti-capitalist motivation behind their co-op, combined with an understanding of some of the issues which can arise. \"We believe that co-operatives could be a useful tool for building a post-capitalist society. Being in a co-operative is not inherently radical. Rather than eliminating the contradictions of capitalism, co-ops internalise many of them,\" says the Bike Foundry's website.</p> <p>Chris Tomlinson, one of the four co-op members, says that they are operating in a market economy against their wishes, but that they still need to ensure that their business is financially sustainable. The group produced a business plan before starting, undertook market research and took advice (including from the conventional business advice service). At present, much of the surplus they are generating is being retained to build reserves and the policy at present is that members only take out what they need to live. \"At the end of every month we work out how much money people need, and we pay wages on that basis,\" Chris says.</p> <p>He argues strongly that co-operative working can result in better decision making. \"I think you're less likely to make stupid errors if</p> <p>important decisions are taken together,\" he says. He also points to the principle of mutual support between co-operatives, and says that his own co-op has benefited both from its participation in Radical Routes and from advice from other co-ops.</p> <p>Radical Routes's newly published workers' co-op handbook is an extended version of an earlier guide which appeared nine years ago. This edition includes detailed advice on business planning, ways to raise capital, financial management, and collective management. The legal structures section has been extensively updated, and covers both Companies Act and Industrial &amp; Provident Societies Act options. There is also recognition of the co-op's obligations as employer towards individual co-op members, with a section which looks at the need in coops to have adequate procedures to cope with any disciplinary and grievance issues. An appendix includes a model employment contract.</p> <p>Radical Routes itself can demonstrate some considerable achievements, not least the creation of its own social investment loan fund <a href=\"http://www.rootstock.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Rootstock</a>, which currently has about half a million pounds either invested in co-ops or ready for investment. Rootstock, which began in 1991 with a \u00a34,000 loan to a Sheffield housing co-op, claims never to have had to write off any bad debts, a result according to Stuart Field of the principle of cooperation operating between coops. \"Banks call in the lawyers when things go wrong. Radical Routes arranges for people in other co-ops to help when they're a problem. It's mutual aid, that's what it's all based on,\" he says.</p> <p><em>Andrew Bibby is a professional writer and journalist</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/blog/serp-crowding-shrinkage-its-not-your-imagination\">SERP Crowding &amp; Shrinkage: It's Not Your Imagination &gt;&gt; SEOmoz</a></h2> <p>For a significant number of searches, Google now only offers 7 results that aren't Google-related (eg YouTube, News). So what can you do about it? Let SEOMoz tell you: </p> <blockquote> <p>In a word: nothing. This isn't an SEO-related change, where an on-page or link-profile tweak might change your SERP back to 10 results. This is an algorithmic volume knob Google can turn and we can't, right or wrong. My best advice is to spot-check the SERPs for your main keywords. Don't just rely on rank-tracking tools - they may tell you that you're in the #8-#10 spot, but they won't tell you whether your SERP cut off after #7. </p> </blockquote> <p> The important point being that if you're not on the first page of results, then 89% of searchers (as of 2005; quite probably more now) won't see your link.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/261096/apple_warns_customers_to_be_cautious_of_sms_after_flaw_cited.html\">Apple warns customers to be cautious of SMS after 'flaw' cited &gt;&gt; PCWorld</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>\"Apple takes security very seriously,\" the company says in its statement. \"When using iMessage instead of SMS, addresses are verified which protects against these kinds of spoofing attacks.\"</p> <p> \"One of the limitations of SMS is that it allows messages to be sent with spoofed addresses to any phone, so we urge customers to be extremely careful if they're directed to an unknown website or address over SMS,\" it adds.</p> <p> Pod2g explains that the SMS flaw allows the sender of the message to enter an address on its reply line that's different from the address that appears on its \"from\" line.</p> </blockquote> <p> Aren't there SMS gateways that allow such spoofing that have been around for ages?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20120820PD229.html\">Supply volume of 7.85-inch iPad to reach 4m units starting in September &gt;&gt; Digitimes</a></h2> <p>Apply salt: </p> <blockquote> <p>Supply volume of Apple's 7.85in iPad is estimated to reach 4m units per month starting in September in order to prepare for demand from year-end holidays, according to sources from the upstream supply chain.</p> <p> Rumors are circulating in the IT market that Apple will launch its 7.85in iPad in October with a thinner screen frame to allow the device to feature a bigger display area than other competing products and will also feature a resolution similar to that of iPad 2.</p> </blockquote> <p> It's like a Rolf Harris picture.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-hollywood-encouraging-onine-piracy\">How Hollywood Is encouraging online piracy &gt;&gt; Scientific American</a></h2> <p>David Pogue: </p> <blockquote> <p>if you don't make your product available legally, guess what? The people will get it illegally. Traffic to illegal download sites has more than sextupled since 2009, and file downloading is expected to grow about 23% annually until 2015. Why? Of the 10 most pirated movies of 2011, guess how many of them are available to rent online, as I write this in midsummer 2012? Zero. That's right: Hollywood is actually encouraging the very practice they claim to be fighting (with new laws, for example).</p> </blockquote> <p> But those films (Fast Five, Hangover 2, Thor...) are available on DVD, and have been for some time. Is there something magical about being able to stream a film that renders it immune from piracy? Or is piracy fuelled by people who want to watch a film as soon as - or even before - it's released, for the lowest price possible? After all, the list of pirate downloads doesn't include Disney classics like Snow White - yet they aren't on streaming services. So \"not on streaming\" isn't the whole story.

As the Gawker breach demonstrated, such password reuse, combined with the frequent use of e-mail addresses as user names, means that once hackers have plucked login credentials from one site, they often have the means to compromise dozens of other accounts, too.</p> <p> Newer hardware and modern techniques have also helped to contribute to the rise in password cracking. Now used increasingly for computing, graphics processors allow password-cracking programs to work thousands of times faster than they did just a decade ago on similarly priced PCs that used traditional CPUs alone. A PC running a single AMD Radeon HD7970 GPU, for instance, can try on average an astounding 8.2 billion password combinations each second, depending on the algorithm used to scramble them. Only a decade ago, such speeds were possible only when using pricey supercomputers.</p> </blockquote> <p> (Thanks @tehgreatgonzo for the link.)</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.pcgamesn.com/article/why-i-m-uninstalling-windows-8\">Why I'm uninstalling Windows 8 &gt;&gt; PCGamesN</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>This isn't an exhaustive list, but it is an exhausting list of reasons why I'll never touch Windows 8 again.</p> </blockquote> <p> He really, really doesn't like the desktop experience.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://iconfactory.com/home/permalink/2379\">Twitterrific: New Rules, Same Road &gt;&gt; Iconfactory</a></h2> <p>Twitterrific was one of the first third-party apps for Twitter: </p> <blockquote> <p>For the past several months, we've been working on a major update to Twitterrific that we're very excited about.

It wants to comply with a court request that Assange should be sent to Sweden for questioning. Assange's supporters have tried to discredit the allegations, saying they are part of a plot to extradite him to the US.</p> <p>Senior politicians in Ecuador have implied much the same. Correas added his voice but said the case needed to be answered. \"I don't want to judge allegations that have not been proven and would not, in any case, be considered a felony in Latin American, too,\" he said. \"It has never been the intention of the Ecuadorean government for Julian Assange not to respond to those allegations.\"</p> <p>Ecuador has proposed interrogations by Swedish investigators on embassy property and has said it would support Assange going to Sweden if it could get reassurances from the UK government that he would not then be extradited to the US.</p> <p>Critics say this is grandstanding for domestic political reasons. Correa \u2013 already Ecuador's longest serving president for a century \u2013 will contest an election early next year. Although his support rates are high, one of his least popular moves has been to assert greater control over the media through lawsuits, referenda and closures of radio stations. Providing a haven for Assage \u2013 a champion of whistleblowers \u2013 may be designed to offset these negative perceptions.</p> <p>During the Q&amp;A on Tuesday Correa addressed this issue and defending an offensive against TV, radio and print. \"Don't let yourself be fooled by what's going. There is this image of the media as being about Woodward and Bernstein and Watergate and the struggle for freedom of expression. But that isn't the case here.\" </p> <p>The reality, he said, was more like the the novel Pantanle\u00f3n y las Visitadoras by Mario Vargas Llosa. \"Instead of grabbing the news they are blackmailing people. The press in Latin America is totally corrupt,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>One of Africa's most powerful and divisive leaders, Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, has died of an undisclosed illness, raising fears of a regional power vacuum.</p> <p>David Cameron was among the world leaders who paid tribute to Meles, a towering political figure who shaped modern Ethiopia in his own image. The country is now one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and among the United States' closest allies on the continent. But human rights groups condemned Meles as an authoritarian strongman whose 21-year rule was marred by rigged elections and the persecution, imprisonment and torture of critics.</p> <p>Meles, 57, died in a hospital in Brussels on Monday after contracting an infection, authorities said. The prime minister had not been seen in public for about two months, and speculation about his health increased after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">he failed to attend a meeting of African Union heads of state in the capital, Addis Ababa, last month</a>.</p> <p>Thousands of mourning Ethiopians descended on the centre of the Addis Ababa as his body was flown back from Brussels.</p> <p>His demise raises the prospect of political turmoil in Africa's second most populous country. Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga, said: \"One fears for the stability of Ethiopia upon his death, because you know that the Ethiopian state is fairly fragile and there is a lot of ethnic violence \u2026 I don't know that [Ethiopian politicians] are sufficiently prepared for a succession: this is my fear \u2013 that there may be a falling out within the ruling movement.\"</p> <p>Hailemariam Desalegn, 47, appointed deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in 2010, will be sworn in as prime minister after an emergency meeting of parliament, said Bereket Simon, the communications minister. On Tuesday, state TV showed pictures of Meles against a soundtrack of classical music. Thousands of mourners thronged outside the airport in Addis Ababa as they awaited Meles's coffin, some holding portraits of the late prime minister and placards that said \"We will continue what you have begun.\" Groups of women dropped to the ground ululating and sobbing.</p> <p>One mourner, Rosa Betemariam, who had been living and working as a dental nurse in the US, said: \"I am devastated. I am visiting Ethiopia after not having been home for 20 years. I am overcome by joy and sadness. I am so sad at his passing but also amazed at what Meles has done for this country. I cannot recognise this city. His vision as a leader has transformed Ethiopia.\"</p> <p>Sitting in a khat bar, where people chew the narcotic leaf, Abraham Getachew, an engineering student, said: \"As a human being, I am upset at the news of his death. But I am not sad that we have lost him as a leader. We do not feel that we have benefited from his leadership. Seventy per cent of students cannot find employment. We want to play a part in the development of Ethiopia but we have not been afforded this opportunity.\"</p> <p>There were numerous tributes from within Africa and beyond. The African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, said: \"The death of Prime Minister Meles has robbed Africa of one of its greatest sons.\" Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said: \"Meles Zenawi was an economic transformer, he was a strong intellectual leader for the continent.\"</p> <p>Cameron described Meles as \"an inspirational spokesman for Africa\" on global issues. \"His personal contribution to Ethiopia's development, in particular by lifting millions of Ethiopians out of poverty, has set an example for the region,\" the British prime minister said.</p> <p>The US viewed Meles as a strong security partner in the war on militant Islamism and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid over the years. US military drones that patrol east Africa, especially over Somalia, are stationed in Ethiopia. At the end of 2006, Somalia's UN-backed government asked Ethiopia to send troops into Somalia to try to put down an Islamist insurgency. Ethiopian troops moved in and captured Mogadishu, but the Somali population rebelled against what it saw as an occupation and Ethiopian forces withdrew in 2009.</p> <p>Ethiopia again sent troops to Somalia in early 2012 as part of an increased international effort to pressure the al-Qaida affiliated group al-Shabaab.</p> <p>On Tuesday al-Shabaab welcomed Meles's death. \"We are very glad about Meles's death. Ethiopia is sure to collapse,\" spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage told Reuters.</p> <p>Human rights groups have long denounced Meles's government for its use of arbitrary detention, torture and surveillance of opposition members. Under a 2009 anti-terror law more than 100 opposition figures have been arrested; the government insists it is tackling rebel groups that have links with al-Qaida and Eritrea. More than 10 journalists have also been charged under the law, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p> <p>Claire Beston, Amnesty International's Horn of Africa researcher, said: \"The 21 years of Meles Zenawi's rule were characterised by ever-increasing repression and widespread human rights violations. \"His government stamped out dissenting voices, dismantled the independent media, obstructed human rights organisations and strangled political opposition.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Ethiopia's jails are packed to the seams with suspected political opponents - from urban intellectuals to rural farmers. Torture and ill-treatment are commonplace. State resources, assistance and opportunities have been broadly used to control the population. Tens of thousands of Ethiopians were forced to flee the country during his rule.\"</p> <p>Critics saw Meles as paying only lip service to democracy. Opposition members accused him of rigging the 2005 election and, when demonstrations broke out, security forces killed at least 200 people and jailed thousands. Almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won an unprecedented number of seats in parliament was jailed for life for treason.</p> <p>In 2010, Meles won a further five years in office while receiving a reported 99% of the vote in an election that the US and other international observers said did not meet international standards.</p> <p>Meles' legacy will be debated. Under him, Ethiopia recorded improvements in education with the construction of new schools and universities. Women gained more rights. In the mid-2000s Ethiopia experienced strong growth, tripling in size in 15 years, which won Meles plaudits. The International Monetary Fund in 2008 said Ethiopia's economy had grown faster than any non-oil exporting country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>But many Ethiopians complain that his close business ties with China did not translate into more jobs. Ethiopia remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 85% of employment. Per capita income is only about $1,000 - about $3 a day.</p> <p>Henok Beyene, an artist, said: \"Meles was an autocrat. Ethiopians have no experience of democracy, we have only ever experienced leadership from autocrats. Zenawi's genius was in how he controlled the minds of his people. He led everyone to believe there was no alternative to his leadership by creating a climate of fear and intimidation.\"</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, an MP, with whom he had three children. State TV said funeral arrangements would be announced soon.</p>",
  "<p>The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, has sharply criticised the BBC and other public bodies for trying to hide their use of covert surveillance powers without any judicial oversight or transparency.</p> <p>Responding to research by the campaign group Big Brother Watch, Pickles said it was \"simply unacceptable\" for publicly funded bodies including the BBC, Ofsted and Royal Mail to use powers in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to spy on the public and then try to avoid any accountability.</p> <p>The research shows that 345 local authorities across Britain have carried out a total of 9,607 covert surveillance operations over the past three years, equating to nearly nine a day using powers intended to combat serious crime and terrorism.</p> <p>The Big Brother Watch report says the powers have been used to tackle problems such as TV licence evasion, trading standards offences, benefit fraud and flytipping, as well as less serious issues.</p> <p>It cites 26 councils that have used Ripa powers to spy on dog owners suspected of not clearing up their pet's mess, and seven that have mounted surveillance operations to test whether the smoking ban was being breached.</p> <p>Kent county council is the most enthusiastic in its use of Ripa investigations, according to the research, mounting 315 operations in the past three years.</p> <p>Legislation introduced by the coalition government will mean that from November local authorities will have to get the approval of a magistrate to use their Ripa powers before mounting a covert surveillance operation.</p> <p>Pickles, in a foreword to the report, said the legislation was needed to curb the \"overzealous town hall bureaucrats\" who have used the powers for trivial issues.</p> <p>\"Councils seriously abused and overused their snooping powers, for matters as trivial as spying on garden centres who sell pot plants; snooping on staff for using work showers; or monitoring shops for unlicensed parrots,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Seven public bodies refused to respond to Big Brother Watch requests under the Freedom of Information Act to disclose why or how often they had used Ripa powers. A further 13 public bodies, including Jobcentre Plus, the Driving Standards Agency and the Gambling Commission, confirmed they had used the powers.</p> <p>The BBC, Ofsted, Royal Mail, UK Border Agency, the Prison Service and UK Trade and Investment refused to make any disclosure, citing an exemption that the information would prejudice a range of law enforcement functions and activities.</p> <p>Pickles said these public bodies should be transparent about why they used the powers. \"It is important that the public can have faith that surveillance powers are being used only in those situations where serious crimes are taking place and only when there are no less intrusive alternative routes of investigation,\" he said.</p> <p>\"That's why we need robust accountability of all state bodies, not just local authorities, to ensure these state powers are not used without proper justification, and I welcome Big Brother Watch's continuing scrutiny and challenge.\"</p> <p>Nick Pickles, of Big Brother Watch, who is not related to the minister, said: \"It is unacceptable for public authorities to keep secret the details of why they are spying on the public and to use these powers without ever seeking a court's approval.</p> <p>\"Judicial approval for spying on us should be the norm, not the exception, and the public have a right to know why and how these powers are being used.\"</p> <p>The Local Government Association said rogue traders, loan sharks and benefit fraudsters have been caught and prosecuted using evidence gathered from surveillance: \"Without these powers it would be much harder, and in some cases impossible, to bring offenders to justice,\" said the LGA's Mehboob Khan.</p> <p>A TV Licensing spokesperson said the BBC used the Ripa powers only to detect licence evaders: \"It is only used as a last resort once other enforcement methods have been exhausted.</p> <p>\"The reason we do not release more details on how and when it is used is to ensure people without a valid TV licence don't use this information to their advantage when attempting to avoid detection.\"</p>"
