  "<p>Three men were arrested on Monday after a police raid on a property in Brighton \u2013 in what is believed to be the first test of new legislation that makes squatting a criminal offence.</p> <p>Sussex Police dismantled barricades and entered the building in London Road following what the force said was the expiry of a 1.50pm deadline by the owner for suspected squatters to vacate the premises.</p> <p>Inside, police in protective gear found three people who had glued themselves together around a joist in the loft and two others had gone on to the roof.</p> <p>Two 22-year-olds and a 29-year-old were taken into custody while two other men, who were on the roof of the building, made their way down and were not arrested, according to police.</p> <p>While squatting was previously treated as a civil matter, new legislation that came into effect at the weekend has created a new offence punishable by up to six months' jail and fines up to \u00a35,000 in England and Wales.</p> <p>Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP for Hove and Portslade, who has campaigned for a change in the law, welcomed the raid on Monday and said in a statement on his website that squatting is \"a huge problem\" in Brighton &amp; Hove. He claimed that there had been \"numerous instances of this organised and frequently menacing behaviour blighting the lives of ordinary people.\"</p> <p>\"I have been campaigning since my election to have squatting criminalised, so it is encouraging to see justice finally served,\" he added.</p> <p>The change in the law affects only residential, not commercial, premises. In a circular sent to judges, courts and the police, the Ministry of Justice confirmed that what are commonly known as \"squatters' rights\" \u2013 preventing forcible entry to an occupied building \u2013 would become redundant in relation to residential premises.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/01/mother-challenge-anti-squatting-legislation\" title=\"\">A legal challenge against the law</a> is being prepared by a mother of four, Irene Gardiner, who has lived as a squatter in a cottage in Newchapel, near Llanidloes, south Wales, for the past 11 years.</p> <p>The 49-year-old, who shares her home with her two youngest children, Hazel, 15, and Sol, 13, fears she could face prosecution after the change in the law.</p> <p>Gardiner said that she has paid council tax since moving into her home while lawyers acting for the charity shop worker have said they believe any action taken against her would be in breach of the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>The housing minister, Grant Shapps, said last week: \"No longer will there be so-called squatters' rights. Instead \u2026 we're tipping the scales of justice back in favour of the homeowner and making the law crystal clear: entering a property with the intention of squatting will be a criminal offence.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK Border Agency faces intense criticism from MPs for causing chaos in the student visa system with a \"poorly planned and ill thought-out\" change in the rules for overseas students.</p> <p>The agency's failings meant an extra 50,000 people abused the system, coming to Britain to work rather than study, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/pac\" title=\"\">Public Accounts Committee</a> (PAC) said.</p> <p>The committee of MPs said in a report published on Monday that the UKBA had enforced new rules for overseas students in 2009 before controls were in place. The result was a \"difficult and costly\" three years as the agency tried to amend the rules to clamp down on abuse.</p> <p>It removed controls such as spot-check interviews of students entering the country, the PAC says. But it did not make the new electronic system, showing a student had been sponsored by a licensed sponsor, mandatory until 2010. Instead, it and relied on sponsors' letters that were \"easily forged\".</p> <p>The report has been published a week after London Metropolitan University was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/taskforce-london-met-international-students\" title=\"\">stripped of its right to teach and recruit students from outside the EU</a>, after audits found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to stay in Britain.</p> <p>The UKBA said there was no proof that a significant proportion of international students at London Met had satisfactory English. In more than half of the cases the university did not know whether students were attending lectures.</p> <p>The decision affects up to 2,700 overseas students, as the university can no longer teach its current international students after losing its licence.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons on Monday, immigration minister Damian Green said: \"UKBA found systemic failures that meant that London Met had not been able to ensure the appropriate admission and tracking of students from abroad.\"</p> <p>The government accused the university of \"failing to address serious and systemic failings\" identified six months ago.</p> <p>Officials will start writing to affected students on 1 October, giving them 60 days to leave Britain or find another university to complete their studies.</p> <p>Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The image around the world is one that is really quite appalling because it suggests that overseas students may well be deported from this country because of a decision made by UKBA for which there is no detail given as to the basis of that decision.\" Many of the university's buildings are in the MP's Islington constituency.</p> <p>The Home Office, through UKBA, introduced Tier 4 of the points-based system of skilled migration in March 2009.</p> <p>It was intended to control the entry of students from outside the EU who come to the UK to study. Under Tier 4 of the system, students have to be sponsored by an educational institution which is licensed by UKBA.</p> <p>Responsibility for testing whether applicants are likely to comply with their visa conditions has been transferred from the UKBA to the sponsoring institution.Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the PAC, criticised the way the new system was introduced.</p> <p>She said: \"The result of the UKBA's poorly planned and ill-thought out course of action was chaos: an immediate high level of abuse of the new system and a surge in the number of student visas.</p> <p>\"In 2009 the number of migrants who abused the student route to work rather than study went up by as much as 40,000 to 50,000.\"Hodge said legitimate international students make a valuable contribution to the UK economy, and the UKBA had a responsibility to reduce burdens on those who do come here to study.</p> <p>But she said UKBA had also been \"unacceptably slow\" to react to a surge in the number of people who abuse student visas.The MP said: \"Even where it has been told by colleges that so-called students are not studying, it has been unacceptably slow to act.</p> <p>\"The UKBA must take urgent enforcement action to remove them. This would also send a message to other would-be migrants that the student route is not an easy option for those with no intention of studying.\"</p> <p>Responding to the PAC report, the immigration Minister said in a statement:</p> <p>\"This government has introduced radical reforms in order to stamp out abuse and restore order to the uncontrolled student visa system we inherited.</p> <p>\"Our hard-hitting new measures are beginning to bite - we have already seen the number of student visas issued drop by 30% in the twelve months to June 2012, compared with the same period in 2011, and recent enforcement action has seen four hundred student overstayers leave the London area and return home.\"\"Tough new rules have seen 500 fewer colleges being able to sponsor international students, and last week London Metropolitan University's licence to teach non-EU students was revoked after it failed to address serious systemic failings.</p> <p>.</p>",
  "<p>Russian oligarchs' taste for British justice helped London lawyers rake in a record-breaking \u00a35bn of profits last year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/humiliation-boris-berezovsky-battle-oligarchs?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich may have won his battle against $6.5bn (5bn) of claims by exiled oligarch Boris Berezovsky</a>, but the legal fees associated with the case are expected to top \u00a3100m.</p> <p>When the lawyers have totted up all the hours spent on the four-month long High Court battle it is expected to rank among the most expensive cases to have been fought in London courts. And Abramovich vs Berezovsky is just one of a slew of oligarch battles making their way through London's legal system, and turning the lawyers involved into multi-millionaires.</p> <p>In a few weeks the High Court will hear the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/oleg-deripaska-litigant-criminal-court?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> next round of a legal battle between Oleg Deripaska, the Russian billionaire friend of Lord Mandelson, and Michael Cherney, a Uzbek-born businessman</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/16/arrest-warrant-kazakh-billionaire-mukhtar-ablyazov\" title=\"\">This year Kazakh billionaire Mukhtar Ablyazov fled from the UK after the court found him guilty of lying about his vast fortune during one of the world's biggest world's biggest ever fraud trails. </a>Ablyazov, who lied about his ownership of a \u00a317m house on The Bishops Avenue in north London, known as London's \"millionaires' row\", is now a fugitive from UK justice.</p> <p>Mark McAteer, national editor of Legal Business magazine, said the Russian legal battles have helped push the profits at top 100 law firms in the Capital to more than \u00a35bn for the first time ever.</p> <p>\"Litigation for Russian clients has been a massive source of revenue for a number of firms \u2013 both big firms and boutique firms,\" he said.</p> <p>McAteer said Russians prefer to have their cases heard in the UK because \"they approve of the system of usually having a fair playing field and we have very good judges and lawyers\".</p> <p>The lawyers are also very well paid. Research by Legal Business shows that on average magic circle firm Slaughter &amp; May's 723 lawyers bill clients for \u00a3620,000 in fees every year.</p> <p>McAteer said seven or eight of London's big law firms paid their partners more than \u00a31m each last year. \"There are partners paid a lot more than that with individual deals and bonuses, but you won't be able to work out how much,\" he added. \"It's accounting so whether [what law firm's publish in their accounts] is a true reflection is a question.\"</p> <p>The Legal Business survey shows combined profits for the top 100 London firms increased by 8% to \u00a35.4bn last year. Revenue rose by 17% to \u00a317.7bn, but the figure is flattered by a number of internal mergers which distort the figures.</p> <p>DLA Piper is London's biggest law firm in terms of revenue, raking in \u00a31.4bn a year, ahead of Clifford Chance on \u00a31.3bn and Linklaters on \u00a31.2bn. The top 100 law firms employ more than 100,000 people.</p> <p>In addition to new Russian business, McAteer said, the growing number of technology patent disputes, including Apple's fight against Samsung for copying its iPhone, have also been big money-spinners.</p>",
  "<p>The head of Foundem, the British search engine company which first triggered an antitrust investigation into Google by the European commission, <a href=\"http://www.searchneutrality.org/google/all-roads-lead-to-remedies\">has warned</a> that the search engine company faces \"a tsunami of follow-on litigation\" if it does not alter its search results in a negotiated settlement.</p> <p>Shivaun Raff, co-founder and chief executive of the company, said that Google's need to avoid huge lawsuits from companies affected by its previous dominance means that Joaquin Almunia's antitrust division at the EC is \"in a far stronger bargaining position than many commentators realise. Anyone suggesting that Google will get away with superficial remedies \u2026 is almost certainly mistaken.\"</p> <p>Almunia began an antitrust investigation into Google's dominance in search in November 2010, and after a series of meetings with chairman Eric Schmidt, in May 2012 issued an ultimatum to the company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/01/google-european-commission-search-results\" title=\"\">setting out four areas where the EC felt Google was abusing its dominance</a>, and giving it weeks to respond. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/02/google-eu-antitrust-case\" title=\"\">Google did so on the last day of the 2 July deadline</a>.</p> <p>Almunia is soon expected to announce more details about the progress of discussions with Google. In July the search giant wrote to him offering a number of tweaks to various elements of its business in Europe, after he set out a number of fields \u2013 especially Google's apparent favouring of its own properties such as YouTube \u2013 in which the EC was seeking remedies to Google's dominance.</p> <p>Raff said that if Google cannot agree a \"settlement agreement\" with the EC \u2013 without recourse to the courts \u2013 Almunia would have to force it through the courts. That could lead to an \"infringement decision\", which would in turn open Google up to lawsuits from companies including Foundem, Ciao and especially its arch-rival Microsoft.</p> <p>\"Unbeknownst to its shareholders, Google's increasingly anti-competitive practices have been quietly accruing billions of dollars of antitrust liabilities,\" Raff said.</p> <p>However, by settling with the EC, Google would avoid any admission of guilt and such lawsuits.</p> <p>Foundem alleged in its complaint in November 2009 \u2013 updated in February 2010, and finally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/30/google-foundem-ec-competition-rules\" title=\"\">acted on by the EC in November 2010</a> \u2013 that Google has favoured its own products while pushing rivals' down its search engine pages.</p> <p>On the key question, of search, Raff suggested that Google could modify its results to use \"clear and conspicuous labelling\" for its own products, as it does with adverts, allied to a requirement to \"crawl, index and rank its own services in exactly the same way [as] everyone else\".</p> <p>For other issues being considered by the EC, including the \"scraping\" of answers from sites which then appear in search results \u2013 obviating the need to click on a link and give the site traffic \u2013 Raff said that services such as price comparisons, flight search links and mortgage comparisons should have to be treated as separate services, rather than \"answers\", as Google presently does.</p> <p>But she said that a key element used by Google to knock out spam sites from its index \u2013 identifying sites with a high proportion of \"copied\" content which are intended to deliver users to other websites \u2013 also hits \"vertical\" search companies such as her own. That must be prevented, she added.</p> <p>Raff said that the EC appears to have decided already that Google broke antitrust law by pushing its own products ahead of rivals': \"the settlement procedure being offered to Google (under Article 9 of the EU Antitrust Regulations) can only be used in cases where the commission's investigation has already concluded (albeit provisionally) that an infringement has taken place.\"</p> <p>The upshot, she added, is that the remedies \"are likely to have a dramatic impact on Google's power to stack the deck in its own favour. The success or failure of Google's secondary services, in travel search, price comparison, social networking, and so on, will once more depend on its ability to innovate, rather than on its ability to hijack the traffic of its competitors.\"</p>",
  "<p>The focus may have been on a more experienced team-mate but at Greenwich Park a new star of Paralympic dressage was born. Natasha Baker finished an astonishing Paralympic debut with a second gold in the freestyle event, to add to her individual championship gold.</p> <p>Taking to the competition arena in her diamant\u00e9-studded helmet, the newcomer \u2013 who cannot control her horse Cabral at all with her legs and instead relies on her seat and voice \u2013 gave a Paralympic record-breaking performance to take gold.</p> <p>Baker, who at 22 is the baby of the Great British para-equestrian team, was considered too internationally inexperienced to take part in the team event. But the European-championship winner topped the grade II field in every event \u2013 team test, individual championship and freestyle \u2013 with the type of scores that will surely see her challenging for that place at Rio 2016.</p> <p>When she spoke after the best ride of her career, which earned a score of 82.800, the smile simply refused to leave her face. \"To do two personal bests at a Paralympics, that's pretty special, isn't it?\" she said. \"I just wanted to do my best \u2013 I did and thank God that best was 82%,\" she said.</p> <p>But the Spanish-influenced routine had not gone entirely to plan, she explained. She got behind her own music so had to improvise, not that the enraptured audience holding their breath in the stands would have known. \"I might improvise a bit more often,\" she said.</p> <p>Baker, who has permanent nerve damage to her spine caused by a virus caught when she was 14 months old, is unable to feel her legs. But she walked a few steps on to the podium with the help of her mother and a walking stick, waving the latter to acknowledge the crowd.</p> <p>The silver medal went to Germany's 46-year-old Britta Napel, who has come second to her friend Baker in three events in these Games, while bronze went to another German, Angelika Tabert.</p> <p>After the medal ceremony, as the riders made their way out of the arena, Napel, in a standard wheelchair, held on to the back of Baker's motorised chair to get a free ride back to the stables.</p> <p>Baker, who said she could not wait until Rio, said she felt she had been on an important journey during her first Games. \"I think I have developed as a rider and I really think I have developed as a person, I feel ancient now after the past six days,\" she said. She had also been surprised by her horse, whom she calls JP. \"I've learnt a lot more about JP, I never imagined he'd come here and be so settled.\"</p> <p>Cabral's owner, Christian Llandolt, explained the genesis of his stable name. \"He is Polish-bred, so when I bought him we were scratching our heads to find the big Polish export \u2013 and we ended up with Jean-Paul,\" he said. \"And maybe someone today looked on us \u2013 so it worked.\"</p> <p>After winning her first gold of the Games on Saturday Baker said Lee Pearson \u2013 who missed out on matching Tanni Grey-Thompson's 11 gold medals after taking bronze \u2013 had inspired her when she watched his performance in Sydney as a 10-year-old. Asked if she had any messages for children in the same situation, she said without hesitation: \"Do it. Follow your heart and follow your dreams and don't let anything hold you back.\"</p>",
  "<p>Robin van Persie has followed the manual to the letter, apart from the bit about taking penalties properly. In the quest to win acceptance from his team-mates at Manchester United, the \u00a324m striker has helped himself by scoring goals that have been spectacular and valuable.</p> <p>At Southampton on Sunday, when his hat-trick brought about the 3-2 comeback win, some of his flicks and polished work took the breath away. It is the knowledge, however, that there is another side to Van Persie's game that has been noted with approval inside the dressing room.</p> <p>\"He is a fighter and he is not scared to play a hard game as well,\" said the captain, Nemanja Vidic, who knows a thing or two about hardness. \"We like him at United for that, I think. Away from home against Southampton he is not scared to receive the ball and have defenders on top of his back. This is important if you want to be top goalscorer here.\"</p> <p>Talent means nothing without bravery and the very best put themselves unflinchingly in harm's way. Cristiano Ronaldo's reputation at United was for the flashier things but the kicks that he took during his six years at the club were always acknowledged, not least by the manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>The backs of Van Persie's legs throbbed at times on Sunday, particularly when the Southampton defender Jos Hooiveld scythed through him to concede the second-half penalty that Van Persie botched with a failed chip. But he had the last laugh at full time after his two late goals and he could blow kisses, wave and stick up his thumbs at the United support, who bounced and belted out his name in song.</p> <p>Van Persie's first goal was a celebration of chest control and left-footed power; the second showcased his ability to react quickest inside the area and the third was the pick of the bunch, a well-timed run followed by an angling of his body in mid-air to direct a header into the far corner.</p> <p>\"When you are a good player,\" Vidic said, \"it is easier to adapt [to a new club] but I think his desire to score plays a big part. You want to play nice football and have good touches and play nice \u2026 it's good but I think that desire he showed to score his goals, this is top-class.\"</p> <p>Van Persie's desire is part of the strength of his character, which was in evidence at St Mary's. He had missed three chances before the penalty but he did not allow it to prey on his mind as he sought the final flourish. He shares his relentless will to win with Ferguson, who reached 1,000 league games on his United watch at Southampton. It is already possible to see Van Persie as the archetypal Ferguson player.</p> <p>\"The manager is an inspiration for us,\" Vidic said. \"Every year he has that hunger to win. He has set up that mentality in the dressing room. It is no coincidence that Manchester United have won so many games in the last minute \u2026 this is what the manager is asking from the players, to always go for the win. You are never happy with the draw. You are always going to the end and you never stop.\"</p> <p>Van Persie paid tribute to Paul Scholes, a 61st-minute substitute on Sunday, for pulling the strings in the fightback. Scholes sent Van Persie through for one of his missed chances almost immediately and the Dutchman described him as \"the man of the match\". Yet it was encouraging to see how Michael Carrick's probing and the intelligent variation of Antonio Valencia's crossing also led to opportunities for Van Persie.</p> <p>Ferguson persuaded the directors at Old Trafford to break with policy and pay a large fee for a 29-year-old. The manager's legacy is assured and, at the age of 70, he will not be in charge for ever. He wanted the finished article, a player to make an immediate impact and, with four goals in two starts, Van Persie is up and sprinting. If he can maintain his fitness, the possibilities feel exhilarating.</p>",
  "<p>Arguably the greater concern for Brendan Rodgers in his thwarted pursuit of Clint Dempsey was not the lack of money shown by Liverpool's owners but their lack of trust. Its absence before the third Premier League game of Rodgers's reign as manager is the principal reason the Anfield soap opera has started even earlier this season.</p> <p>When Rodgers was unveiled as Kenny Dalglish's successor on 1 June he had successfully, after three rounds of talks with John W Henry and Tom Werner, ensured he would be a manager left to manage. So he thought. Plans for a sporting director had been shelved, there would be no ominous figure such as Louis van Gaal for the rising young coach to contend with and he \"would be in charge of football matters\".</p> <p>Prophetically, in light of Friday's non-event of a transfer deadline day at Liverpool, he elaborated on that optimistic day: \"I am better when I have control. I am not a power freak. But my point is that I need to feel that I can manage in terms of the team and I have a direct, clear line through to the owners. Once that becomes hazed and grey, for me there is a problem.\" It was hardly the radical overhaul of English football management that Fenway Sports Group had envisaged for Liverpool but a sensible compromise by owners wanting a clean slate under Rodgers nonetheless.</p> <p>Fast forward to last Thursday night. The Liverpool manager has let Andy Carroll join West Ham United on loan with no replacement secured and, having negotiated a passage into the Europa League group stage with an aggregate victory over Hearts, makes a late-night phone-call to Boston to outline the case for Dempsey again. Rodgers was well aware of FSG's preference, to use the contents of Henry's letter of appeasement to Liverpool supporters, for \"a self-sustaining pool of youngsters imbued in the club's traditions\" and not \"expensive, short-term quick fixes that will only contribute for a couple of years\". He was also conscious of the owners' fears, having squandered a fortune on Carroll, Stewart Downing, Jordan Henderson and Charlie Adam under Dalglish and Damien Comolli. Hence, for example, his refusal to bow to Gylfi Sigurdsson's wage demands before the Icelandic midfielder ended up at White Hart Lane.</p> <p>But having slashed the wage bill and recouped roughly a third of his \u00a329m transfer spend through transfer and loan fees, and with only Luis Su\u00e1rez and Fabio Borini left as a strike force, he had reason to believe FSG would deliver a 29-year-old scorer of 23 goals last season who was desperate to join Liverpool. They responded by offering Fulham less than the fee already agreed with Aston Villa \u2013 whether it was \u00a33m as Fulham claim or Liverpool's \u00a34m, it was still less than Villa's \u00a35m plus add-ons \u2013 and undermined Rodgers' judgment at a stroke. It once again raises the question of who is advising FSG?</p> <p>Given that Henry's first appointment as principal owner was Comolli, whom he quickly promoted to director of football, it is clear the advice has been questionable from the start of FSG's reign almost two years ago. \"There are operational things we need to sort out,\" said Rodgers after Sunday's defeat by Arsenal.</p> <p>The club's transfer dealings this summer were not helped by Manchester City placing Dave Fallows on gardening leave once he had accepted the job of Liverpool's head of scouting and recruitment and some suspect FSG pays more heed to the data provided by the head of analytics, Michael Edwards, than the opinions of the club's manager.</p> <p>Henry's open letter reads like a check list of the criticisms received on Twitter since Friday and demonstrated the acute sensitivity of the Liverpool hierarchy. The rift between owners and manager is not irreparable far from it, but taking flak via social media in Boston is nothing compared with what could befall Rodgers on the touchline at Anfield should Friday's inaction take its toll.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron should scrap a planned vote to reduce the number of MPs by 50, Nick Clegg said as he accused the Conservatives of failing to uphold the coalition agreement on House of Lords reform.</p> <p>In a statement to MPs after abandoning plans to reform the Lords last month, the deputy prime minister also rejected out of hand modest changes to the upper house proposed by the former Liberal leader Lord Steel of Aikwood.</p> <p>Clegg briefed MPs on the government's decision to shelve reform of the House of Lords after attending a meeting of the \"quad\" group of senior ministers \u2013 himself, the prime minister, George Osborne and Danny Alexander \u2013 to discuss the government's new plans for economic growth. The deputy prime minister told MPs that abandoning Lords reforms has opened up space in the parliamentary programme for bills to provide \u00a340bn to guarantee infrastructure projects and \u00a310bn for new house building.</p> <p>Clegg said: \"The prime minister and I will be making some announcements shortly on how we will use this opportunity of a gap, an unexpected gap in the legislative timetable, in order to push forward things which will help to create growth and jobs in our economy.\"</p> <p>The deputy prime minister also spoke to the prime minister last week about Lib Dem appointments in tomorrow's ministerial reshuffle. David Laws, former chief secretary to the Treasury, is expected to return to government as an education minister. Whether he can have a roving brief across general government policy in the Cabinet Office is under discussion. Jo Swinson, Clegg's parliamentary private secretary, is also expected to be promoted.</p> <p>Clegg hopes the return of Laws will strengthen his team in government amid unease in the party about his leadership. Lord Oakeshott, the party's former Treasury spokesman in the Lords who is a close ally of Vince Cable, called last week for Lib Dems to consider a change in \"strategy and management\".</p> <p>Senior Lib Dems are saying Cable, who let it be known over the summer that he would be available if Clegg stood down, is \"on manoeuvres\". The business secretary's case is helped by a poll in the Independent which shows the party would enjoy a four point bounce if he became leader. The ComRes/Independent poll put support for the Lib Dems at 14% under Clegg. When respondents were asked how they would vote if Cable were leader, this increased to 18%.</p> <p>Clegg showed his impatience with Oakeshott when he joked to MPs that he wished the peer would retire. \"Having seen the coverage of the views of one or two members of the other place from my party, I can think of one or two I hope would take early retirement,\" he said.</p> <p>But he also hit out at the prime minister as he said the Lib Dems are no longer bound to support government plans to reduce the size of the House of Commons from 650 to 600 MPs because of Cameron's failure to deliver sufficient Tory support for Lords reform. The plans are on the statute book but cannot be implemented until there is a final vote in the Commons.</p> <p>Clegg was asked by John Spellar, a former Labour defence minister and a scathing critic of the Lib Dems, how the plans to shrink the Commons could remain on the statute book. Clegg responded: \"The primary legislation remains in place. There is clearly \u2013 it is not rocket science this \u2013 no agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrat parties in the coalition agreement to repeal that primary legislation. So it stands. I happen to agree with him that, given that the final vote is a foregone conclusion, we might as well not push it to a vote.</p> <p>\"But, perfectly understandably, other members of the government want to push it to a vote. I have made it crystal clear what my position and that of my Liberal Democrat colleagues will be when that vote occurs.\"</p> <p>Clegg was scathing about Lord Steel's proposals. These would extend a voluntary retirement scheme, require expulsion of peers convicted of criminal offences and those who do not not appear in the house. He said: \"Any scrutiny of that draft bill will show that it will barely trim at the margins the size of the House of Lords. By its own reckoning it doesn't actually do what it purports to do: which is to dramaticallyt reduce the size of the House of Lords. While I have a great deal of respect for the considerable amount of time and effort Lord Steel has put into this, my own view remains that there is no surrogate for democracy.\"</p>",

A comparison with the last BBC adaptation \u2013 with Judi Dench and Ronald Hines in 1964 \u2013 shows just how much more conservative Britain's political culture has become since the 60s. And that does not bode well for the country's future.</p> <p>Tom Stoppard's version is undeniably more conservative than the Ford Madox Ford novel. In Parade's End, Ford showed how the smug and exploitative ruling elites \u2013 \"Church! State! Army! HM Ministry! HM Opposition! HM City Man!\" \u2013 had brought Britain to bloody and ruinous war.</p> <p>His principal character, Christopher Tietjens \u2013 a very deliberate combination of country gentleman and imperial statistician \u2013 blends two of the three ruling \"castes\": those of the old warrior aristocracy and the technocratic sage. As a classic paternalistic Tory, Tietjens naturally despises the third caste \u2013 that of the commercial merchant.</p> <p>But for Ford himself, all three castes were deeply culpable. Certainly, Ford has some sympathy for Teitjens \u2013 a fundamentally decent character. But before wartime traumas erode his ingrained certainties, he is shown to be deeply complacent and unthinkingly arrogant. By 1922, when Ford embarked on the novel, he had become seriously disillusioned with this Tory type; he had, as he said, \"arrived at the stage of finding the gentleman an insupportable phenomenon\".</p> <p>Stoppard's Tietjens, however, is a much more positive figure. True, Stoppard gently satirises his stuffiness. But he empathises with him and approves of his view that \"'parade' stands for a certain way of conducting yourself, a bearing, a stance to do with integrity, dignity and not being swept away by commercialism or nationalism\". Benedict Cumberbatch, the lead actor, goes even further, gushing: \"I completely fell in love with Christopher Tietjens, the most long-suffering and adorable character I've ever played.\" His portrayal is worlds apart from Hines's 1964 Blimp, and certainly from the \"insolent, indolent\" figure that Ford had envisaged.</p> <p>Politically, then, the Parade's End of Stoppard is not too different from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/25/downton-abbey-series-three\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a>: gently Tory. But unfortunately this is all too predictable in times like these. For the last time we saw such an epidemic of Tory nostalgia was in the 1930s. After the merchant-driven Wall Street crash of 1929, the conservative-voting middle classes faced a frightening world of social and international conflict. They rejected a failed commercialism, and sought instead a return to an imaginary world of idealised hierarchy \u2013 paternalistic, yet free of the old aristocratic warmongering that had brought them the suffering of the trenches.</p> <p>This was the politics that produced the largely Conservative-Liberal coalition of tweedy country gent <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/baldwin_stanley.shtml\" title=\"\">Stanley Baldwin</a>. The appeal of David Cameron's coalition with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats in 2010 was very similar: it promised a \"nice\", stable hierarchy, without City shysters and Blairite wars. Since then the Conservatives have badly blurred the message, as Cameron's \"big society\" has given way to George Osborne's brazen, if bumbling, bankophilia. So today it is in culture rather than politics that we find most evidence of a yearning for Gentle Toryism \u2013 in the popularity of costume dramas and the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137858/king-s-speech\" title=\"\">The King's Speech</a>, and in the remarkable resurgence of royalism.</p> <p>But such cosy conservatism was not the answer in the 1930s, nor is it today. For Baldwin's Con-Libs failed to solve Britain's main problems \u2013 unemployment and gross inequality. It was the post-second world war alliance of the sage and the economically egalitarian worker that brought the real global recovery, not the gentleman: by creating welfare states, giving more power to labour and controlling merchants \u2013 most importantly in international finance \u2013 governments succeeded in investing in growth while creating a more economically and socially equal society.</p> <p>We cannot return to that system today, and nor should we. It had its own fatal flaws, breeding an arrogant elite of technocrats, and excluding women, ethnic and sexual minorities. And it was the rigidity of technocratic politics that provoked the student revolutions of the 1960s and fuelled the merchant backlash of the 1980s. Any new political settlement must be more culturally inclusive. Even so, only a new, remodelled worker-sage compact can bring equality, and manage an increasingly complex global economy.</p> <p>So far, the prospects do not look good. Our leaders are still in thrall to merchant values and terrified of the bond markets. Any efforts to control finance and save the environment need serious international co-operation, and that is in short supply. Workers, meanwhile, are weakened by unemployment and competition from low-wage developing economies.</p> <p>But that does not mean we have to be satisfied with a TV diet of Tory Never Never Lands in the meantime. For a cultural alternative is easier to achieve than a new political economy. The extraordinary reception of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle's extravaganza</a> of ward sisters and steelworkers showed how popular \u2013 and inventive \u2013 a social democratic culture can be.</p> <p>The BBC should commission from both left and right, as well as from centrists like Stoppard. But it also has a responsibility to challenge stodgy, conventional wisdom rather than simply pandering to it \u2013 even if that means raining on our post-Olympics parade.</p>",
  "<p>London's Paralympic Games have been notable in many ways: brilliant performances, full-house stadiums \u2013 testimony to the enduring armchair passions of a nation that effectively invented the modern spectator sport \u2013 and now even a bespoke high-profile cheating row. When it comes to highly skilled, highly physical team competition, the best is perhaps yet to come, with wheelchair basketball set to enter its knockout stages after Monday's round of decisive final group matches in front of a large and boisterously partisan crowd at the North Greenwich Arena.</p> <p>This is a brilliant sport, one that invariably surprises the novice spectator not just with its refined skill levels \u2013 the net-fluttering field goal, the veering dribble \u2013 but also with its sheer concussive physicality. Court-side it even has its own smell, the mild tang of burning rubber that rose intermittently as first Great Britain's women and then the men's team secured their passage to the knockout stages, albeit in contrasting fashion.</p> <p>Britain's men emerged in the early afternoon to full-throated cheers from a three-quarter full house inside this cavernous arena \u2013 once the wretched Millennium Dome, now a kind of dandified cinema complex and this summer put to good use as a brilliantly atmospheric sporting arena.</p> <p>These are rare Paralympians indeed, an impressively mobile and powerful collection of athletes practising one of the elite disciplines of these Games. Wheelchair basketball is one of the more distinct sports here, one that stands apart from being simply a parallel discipline to an Olympic sport. It has a purity: as with the high-intensity sport of wheelchair rugby these are unreservedly the best people in the world at this. Three weeks ago North Greenwich was also the venue for Olympic basketball, the same lacquered boards trod by the celebrified multimillionaires of the NBA. But this is an expert discipline in its own right, a sport that requires instinctive control of its own two-wheeled apparatus and which has evolved to stand in its own right.</p> <p>There was an edge to this match with ParalympicsGB needing to beat Japan to ensure they progressed automatically to the play-offs. For Japan, who needed to win by an improbable 21 points to secure their own passage, the main threat would come from their most famous player Reo Fujimoto, who has averaged 18.5 points a game, second in the competition only to the wonderful Patrick Anderson of Canada. As befits his star status Fujimoto emerged last as the teams were introduced, raising his own thrum of excitement among the Japanese contingent in the bleachers.</p> <p>The stands themselves were smothered in union flags, a giant-sized bunting effect on a more intense scale than anything seen here during the Olympics, and joined during the Japanese anthem \u2013 which sounds a lot like the incidental music from an epically sombre spaghetti Western \u2013 by a smattering of Japanese flags around the hoardings.</p> <p>To rousing cheers Great Britain took the game to Japan straightaway, their opening basket after 40 seconds greeted with a rapturous roar. As with wheelchair rugby, originally known as Murderball, this is effectively a contact sport. A juddering collision after two minutes left Great Britain's Abdi Jama in a heap in the centre of the court.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards Fujimoto, an imposing bulldozer of a man, scragged Ade Orogbemi spectacularly on the left flank, before streaking downfield and using his reach to plonk another two-pointer in off the backboard. Great Britain, though, were simply more mobile, covering the court with great speed, passing the ball better and by the start of the second quarter easing clear of their opponents. By the end of the second quarter the lead was a comfortable 46-24.</p> <p>Half-time can be a gruelling affair. As for the Olympics the arena is again equipped with an in-house MC of prolific inanity, his imprecations sandwiched between the usual migrainous blurts of robot-voiced pop jollity. This is a younger crowd, though, and a more surprising one, too. In the midst of the half-time capering a small girl plucked seemingly at random from the audience serenaded the entire arena over the PA system with, not just a chorus, but every single word of Rolf Harris' Two Little Boys, a performance received in reverent silence and applauded thunderously at the end. It might have been unbearably mawkish. Somehow it was instead an unreserved triumph.</p> <p>If the British men were making certain of their progress to the quarter-finals, the women had already secured their own place in the knockout phase, albeit doing so while losing 67-50 to Canada. Helen Freeman top-scored with 18 points for the British team and Katie Harnock reeled off 20 for the Canadians but, in truth, it was all rather by the by as under the rules of the competition four out of five teams in each pool qualify for the next phase, a most forgiving of formats. Perhaps, as with the men, the women's tournament would benefit from streamlining.</p> <p>This is a sport that has put more thought than most into providing a level playing field. The classifications are finely poised but relatively clear. Athletes with an impairment to at least one leg are eligible to compete, with degrees of physical function beyond that rated from 1.0 (low function) to 4.5 (high) and the combined pots of the five players on court must not exceed 14. Different class players get chairs of different heights, introducing a secondary engineering function to a sport that does not come cheap. The average cost is \u00a33,500 for a titanium chair that is expected to last not much longer than six months.</p> <p>It makes for an involvingly intricate sport of minute and rarefied angles. As the final hooter sounded on the men there were prolonged, flag-fluttering cheers for an entertaining 71-55 victory for Great Britain, the players, bruised and exhausted, leaving the arena to mass high-fives for a coterie of junior fans leaning over the tunnel wall.</p> <p>As Fujimoto gave a series of apparently endless and unremittingly detailed interviews to the massed Japanese TV crews gathered in the bowels of the arena, the British players departed to await the evening results and discover the identity of their quarter-final opponents on Wednesday. Murray Treseder, Great Britain's Australian team coach, was typically bullish. \"We have to be at our best and, if we are, we will certainly represent the nation very proudly and show the bulldog spirit.\" On this evidence that much at least seems a given.</p>",

  "<p>Bruce Willis, the movie star, may or may not be amazed that he's not allowed to bequeath his Apple iTunes music collection to his children. A <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2197248/Bruce-Willis-fights-leave-iPod-tunes-family-Actor-considering-legal-action-Apple-battle-owns-songs-downloaded-iTunes.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\">Daily Mail story</a> alleging this has apparently been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmaHeming/status/242631258310594562\">disowned by the actor's wife</a>.</p> <p>Whether the story is true or not, it nonetheless highlights one of the largely unspoken \u2013 and outrageous \u2013 realities of the digital age: ownership is disappearing.</p> <p>Publishers of books, music and movies have always wanted a world in which consumers of these media must pay again and again for the privilege. And as content moves into digital formats, the entertainment is moving within legal if not technical reach of that goal.</p> <p>The Mail's story quotes a lawyer making a key point:</p> <blockquote> <p>Lots of people will be surprised on learning all those tracks and books they have bought over the years don't actually belong to them. It's only natural you would want to pass them on to a loved one.</p> </blockquote> <p>Natural, maybe, but a violation of the onerous <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html\">terms and conditions</a> that Apple, Amazon and the other \"sellers\" of digital content impose on their customers. Despite promotional language \u2013 in giant letters \u2013 with the words \"buy\" and \"purchase\", you are only buying a <em>license to use</em> the material yourself, and legally that's all. So, who inherits your library, <a href=\"http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-08-23/finance/33336852_1_digital-content-digital-files-apple-and-amazon\">under today's system</a>? Nobody, and that's just wrong.</p> <p>Now, Willis can easily ensure that his MP3s will be usable by his children. All he has to do is move the files onto an external hard disk and hand it to one of them, which he could do with a CD or vinyl-record collection. I would stress one of his daughters, because even though I consider current copyright laws an abomination, I also believe that transferring the material to more than one person would violate the spirit of copyright.</p> <p>If you think Apple's MP3 terms of service are bad (they are), they're no worse than Amazon's, which also pretends to sell music. In fact, you're only renting it. (As the holder of a small number of Amazon shares, I'm dismayed by the company's kowtowing to corporate interests this way, but understand that it, like Apple, has little choice given the entertainment giants' clout.)</p> <p>There's no indication in the Mail story that Willis wants the same transfer rights for any movies he's downloaded and stored in his iTunes archive. Most likely, he owns the DVDs and/or Blue-Ray disks and would just hand them over. Perhaps he's fine with the digital rights management (DRM) that \u2013 though laughably easy to break \u2013 prevents re-use of movies and TV shows in the same way that unprotected music, which is now the norm, easily allows.</p> <p>Not all publishers put DRM or huge restrictions on their material. I'd encourage people to buy from them whenever possible, and encourage the right thing by voting with your wallet.</p> <p>The situation with books is just as bad as with videos. Amazon, through its overwhelming Kindle ebook market share, puts huge restrictions on what you can do with what you've downloaded. And because the major book publishers have insisted on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/23/ebook-price-swindle-publishing\">pricing that amounts to a swindle</a>, given the fact that you can't resell or even give away a Kindle title, buying books from major publishers for the Kindle is plain idiotic. A court case is likely to change this equation, but the bottom line with the Kindle is simple: the books last as long as you do and essentially no longer, unless someone takes over your personal Amazon account.</p> <p>In a way, Willis is fighting the last war. The entertainment industry is rapidly steering us all toward a stream-from-the-cloud model, in which we buy the right to watch or listen or read, but where the rights are limited in time and device. This pay-per-view world would make even Willis's dilemma moot, because he'd never own anything \u2013 which makes it the most dangerous model of all for users of digital content. I use some cloud services, but I buy and back up (legally or not) the things I want to keep.</p> <p>Since the publishers, record labels and movie studios are unlikely to permit sanity in the digital marketplace, and given lawmakers' propensity for following the industry's dictates in passing increasingly draconian copyright laws, it's up to the rest of us to come up with solutions. Music, as noted, is relatively easy though technically not allowed \u2013 and you can be sure that the entertainment magnates are working on ways to thwart even family hand-me-downs. Using software such as the brilliant <a href=\"http://handbrake.fr\">Handbrake</a>, meanwhile, it's relatively simple to convert DVDs and remove the DRM for backup purposes, or whatever else you might consider appropriate. Even Kindle and other e-formatted books can be made more user-friendly, though as far as I can tell, this is less simple.</p> <p>Note that I am not suggesting that you post your music or videos online for just anyone to download. I believe in copyright as a principle, but I believe even more that we should have at least the right to back up and transfer what we've paid for.</p> <p>One of the more innovative fixes I've heard of is to create a legal entity that buys the music/movie/book licenses, and then to put that entity under the control of your heirs. If this was easy and inexpensive, it would make at least some sense. But one guesses that the entertainment industry would either quickly find a way to stop this \u2013 probably by forcing Apple, Amazon et al to change license terms \u2013 or promote new legislation banning the practice.</p> <p>The greatest hypocrisy of the publishers and their allies in this situation is their insistence that \"intellectual property\" is the same as physical property, which is a lie. They create vast rights for themselves, and then they ensure that buyers have no property rights whatever when it comes to the items they've purchased in turn. When I buy a physical CD or book or DVD, I can sell it or give it away \u2013 pass along the container with its content.</p> <p>To disallow this in the digital age is the industry's greatest desire \u2013 and a gigantic screw-you to its customers.</p> <p><em>* This article has been updated from an earlier version in light of the comments made by Bruce Willis's wife regarding the original Daily Mail story</em></p>",
  "<h2><strong>Unforgettable: The&#xa0;Sweeney</strong><br>8pm, ITV1</h2> <p>\"We're the Sweeney, son, and we haven't had any dinner.\" Flashback to the 1970s, when a young John Thaw \u2013 the guv'nor with the one-liners \u2013 and his partner, a younger Dennis Waterman, would charge around London in a Ford Consul nicking villains. The Sweeney was hard-hitting, violent TV for the time, and realistic in that the coppers were willing to bend the law and quick with their fists. This documentary looking back at the series features Waterman, Thaw's widow Sheila Hancock and Ray Winstone, who stars in the upcoming big-screen adaptation. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2><strong>Voices of a Generation</strong><br>8pm, Sky Arts 1<br></h2> <p>In which actor/knight Michael Gambon discusses his career. Born in Dublin, Gambon trained as a tool-maker, then discovered his vocation after joining an amateur theatre group. A key break came when Laurence Olivier invited him to join the National Theatre for its first season. Much of the rest of what follows is more familiar \u2013 TV stardom, his turn as a mobster in The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover and twinkle-eyed mentordom as Dumbledore in the Harry Potter flicks \u2013 but no less worth hearing about. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2><strong>Accused</strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Accused winds up its four parts with a characteristically grim tale following events in a young offenders' institution. The suicide of an unstable inmate (Robert Sheehan) leads to an inquiry in which two prison officers (Ewen Bremner and Anna Maxwell Martin) back each others' stories to cover up their negligence. The leads are excellent, while the returning John Bishop continues to show his versatility. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>The Midwives</strong><br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Like 24 Hours In A&amp;E, The Midwives understands that pointing cameras at genuine medical drama rarely fails to deliver compelling television. The final episode of this series follows the midwives into the homes of new parents to make sure they're feeding and clothing their children correctly. The admiration one might already have felt for the midwives swells further as they counsel parents struggling with responsibility, as in cases such as those confronted tonight, where the mother is alone, or they speak the language hesitantly, or have disappeared entirely. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Falling Skies</strong><br>9pm, FX<br></h2> <p>Season finale time, and while this rather uneven show's future is still uncertain, they certainly gave it their best shot, leaving us with something that improved as it went on. While there's still dialogue that clunks and far too many contrived plot turns, the rebel factions \u2013 both human and \"skitter\" \u2013 have made everything much more interesting. Was it too little too late, though? In this final episode, more about the alien masterplan is uncovered, a weakness in their chain of command is spotted and, in a rare upbeat moment, Tom and Dr Anne receive good news. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2><strong>Suburgatory</strong><br>9.30pm, E4<br></h2> <p>It's Thanksgiving in Suburgatory but the spirit of the season has deserted Tessa, who isn't relishing the prospect of spending her holiday in the ever-so twee Chatswin. So she tricks the preening Dallas Royce (Curb Your Enthusiasm's Cheryl) into taking her into Manhattan for lunch, where she finds her father George in a compromising position. The stage is set for a showdown at the Royce family's culturally insensitive celebration lunch. The mix of the surreal and the standard sitcom zingers sits a little uncomfortably, but there are still flashes of inspiration. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p>",
  "<p>Much has changed since the wannabe prime minister David Cameron pledged to give a third of his first government's jobs to women, thereby ending what he called the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/mar/02/women.gender\" title=\"\">\"scandalous under-representation\"</a> in parliament. Not least the fact that, once in Downing Street, he promptly appointed just five women to his 23-strong cabinet. There may be a female home secretary in Theresa May, but at 22%, the UK ranks 57th in terms of female parliamentary representation, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cfwd.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Women and&#xa0;Democracy</a>.</p> <p>Since the coalition came to power there has been the leaked internal memo about the Tories' \"problem with women\", the appointment of an unelected woman to give the feminine perspective to Number 10 and economic policies that see female unemployment at a 25-year high.</p> <p>Will Cameron make amends with his first major cabinet reshuffle, expected shortly? And, if so, how much will it matter? We ask several leading feminist thinkers:</p> <h2><strong>Natasha Walter <br>Author and director of Women for Refugee Women</strong><br></h2> <p>\"Clearly, the reshuffle gives the government an opportunity to put some more female faces into those rows of grey men. I'm sure that the women who have been mentioned as possible new ministers \u2013 from Jo Swinson to Claire Perry, Maria Miller to Helen Grant \u2013 will prove quite as competent and articulate as the men they replace. But will they be able to bring any commitment to greater equality and justice into this government? That would mean creating a change of direction rather than a change of personnel, and nobody is suggesting that is on the cards.\"</p> <h2><strong>Susie Orbach <br>Psychotherapist, writer&#xa0;and campaigner</strong><br></h2> <p>\"As every agency I can think of that helps women is being decimated by the coalition I'm not sure how much the reshuffle matters. The health service, work and education are at the forefront of the most appalling attacks by the coalition. They are not going to do the things that need to be done: raise the minimum wage, provide proper childcare, education and training. This is an ideological government and they use language to cover nefarious doings.</p> <p>\"I do feel strongly though that Lynne [Featherstone, equalities minister] should stay. She has taken body image to the UN and has also fought for gay marriage. I also think Jo Swinson [Liberal Democrat MP] should be moved in. Both have worked well together.\"</p> <h2><strong>Bea Campbell <br>Writer and campaigner </strong><br></h2> <p>\"It is important to have more women in cabinet because presence is important. Coalition leaders should know that the cabinet is woefully short of women, that it needs to be representative, and should get on with it and make it so. They won't of course.Coalition women MPs don't seem to understand the importance of the Equality Act \u2013 and the statutory duties to pay 'due regard' to equality in all policymaking - including the budget. We should hear no more about women ministers 'nagging', no more behaving like subordinates, and lamenting their lack of power. They've got more power than the rest of us. Coalition women MPs should be asking themselves: do they want to participate in the worst government for women since the second world war? They should make their government do something very straightforward: the right thing.</p> <h2><strong>Ceri Goddard <br>Head of Fawcett Society</strong><br></h2> <p>\"The reshuffle is a golden opportunity for the prime minister to boost the presence and influence of women in British politics. Ninety years after women first got the vote, the nation is run by a cabinet made up of more millionaires than women. Women are bearing the brunt of austerity measures in terms of cuts to benefits and services. If you're not at the table, you're on the menu. Other countries fare much better, even when it comes to cabinet-level posts \u2013 indeed, Sweden, Switzerland and France all have equal numbers of men and women in their cabinets. Why can't we?\"</p> <h2><strong>Holly Dustin<br>Director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition</strong></h2> <p>\"First and foremost we'd like to see more women in Cabinet and government to ensure that women's lives and experiences are better reflected in policy-making. There are some great women in both parties who deserve promotion such as Lib Dem Jo Swinson who has been a long time supporter of our campaign to end violence against women in the UK, as well as Margot James, Jane Ellison and Helen Grant on the Conservative backbenches who also speak out about this issue. Theresa May has long-championed work on violence against women and leads this as Home Secretary. It is difficult to see who else in Cabinet at present would do this if she were moved.\"</p> <h2><strong>Rowan Harvey <br>Women's Rights Advocacy Advisor, ActionAid UK</strong></h2> <p>\"No one could doubt that Andrew Mitchell [development secretary] has genuinely come to understand how central women are to development efforts. If he were to move on in the reshuffle, recent initiatives, including the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning, are hopefully part of a process that his successor will continue Central to this should be a scaling up by DFID DFID should also scaleas well as scaling up work to combat violence against women.\"</p> <h2><strong>Jenny Jones <br>Green party member of&#xa0;London Assembly</strong></h2> <p>\"A reshuffle is a chance for some bravery. It's time for even the Tories to acknowledge that women still don't have their fair share of jobs, power, or responsibility. Yet whether or not Lynne Featherstone, who has disappointed many feminists who wanted more gumption, is replaced with Jo Swinson who voted for raising the upper limit on university tuition fees despite advocating free education for most of her career, I'm not sure. Why not find the ideas first and then the right people to push them&#xa0;through? Even I, a lifelong feminist, could just about stomach a man as equalities minister, if he advocated and&#xa0;made happen the Norwegian law of&#xa0;40% quota for women on company boards.\"</p> <h2><strong>Julie Bindel <br>Writer and activist</strong><br></h2> <p>Lynne Featherstone, the most seniorLiberal Democrat woman, should be moved out of government by Cameron. Much as it pains me to say, the Lib Dems are worse than the Tories even when it comes to tackling violence against women and girls. Featherstone also toes the party line that decriminalizing prostitution would help to eliminate the abuse within the industry, despite evidence to the contrary from the Netherlands and elsewhere. I cannot think of one woman in either the Conservative or Lib Dem party who has any sense of how to promote equality for women, so would opt for Alistair Burt to do the job. From what I hear he has been good on tackling discrimination towards asylum seekers. It is a stark choice.</p>",
  "<p>The storm arrived at the Venice film festival on Monday lunchtime. Thunder cracked, bunting billowed and the walkways ran with water. If festival director Alberto Barbera required a fitting backdrop for his promised tougher, more urgent slate of pictures, the conditions could not have been more perfect. The mood had been set by back-to-back morning screenings of Something in the Air, a heady tale of leftist insurrection, and Disconnect, in which cyber-culture was cast as the villain. The day's other films told tales of abandoned children, the Libyan uprising and the parlous state of the US housing market. Even inside the cinemas, there was little shelter from the storm.</p> <p>On taking over the festival this year, Barbera signalled a contrast to the 2011, when Madonna had dominated the press coverage with her widely-ridiculed royal drama W.E.</p> <p>Barbera vowed that the 69th Venice film festival would be more about substance and less about celebrity. The programme combines a more streamlined main competition \u2013 18 films as opposed to 23 last year \u2013 with a greater representation for female film-makers, finding room for an unprecedented 20 women directors in the event's various sections.</p> <p>\"Instead of trying to become bigger, like most other festivals, we are going the other way by becoming more relevant and exclusive,\" Barbera explained this week. \"There is no automatic entry to Venice \u2013 not even for established film-makers.\"</p> <p>Something in the Air, Monday's main competition title, was a period drama that spoke to the present, turning the clock back to the dog-days of student protest in early-70s France. Olivier Assayas's semi-autobiographical drama spotlights the brick-throwing exploits of the VLR (Vive le Revolution) activists, before the onset of adulthood takes its members in different directions. The bittersweet ending anticipates what the director sees as a growing disillusion in the decades that followed. \"The youth of today is more reasonable,\" he claimed. \"Everyone is radical but, alas, they stand for nothing.\"</p> <p>But the American actor India Salvor Menuez \u2013 one of the film's ensemble cast \u2013 claimed that the drama found echoes in the activism of today. \"With the Occupy movement you can see a lot of the same discontent that you see in the film,\" she argued. \"Perhaps the approach is more confused among the youth of today. But the feeling is still there.\"</p> <p>By contrast to Assayas's history lesson, Disconnect could have been torn from current headlines, dishing out a cautionary tale of cyber-bullying and identity fraud. \"We tried to make a film that is topical and speaks directly to the issues that face all of us every day,\" said the film's director, Henry-Alex Rubin. \"Technology and social media were supposed to bring us together. But they sometimes end up pushing us further and further apart.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, there have been mixed fortunes for the two most hotly-anticipated pictures at this year's festival. Where Paul Thomas Anderson's 1950s-set drama The Master made its debut to rapturous applause, Terrence Malick's To the Wonder \u2013 an elliptical account of a romance turned sour \u2013 bowed out to a chorus of boos.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the response will hurt To the Wonder's chances of winning the festival's crowning Golden Lion award this weekend: the director's previous work, The Tree of Life, weathered a similar barrage at last year's Cannes film festival and still went on to take the top prize.</p> <p>But as the festival enters the final straight, insiders are predicting that The Master remains the film to beat. Partly inspired by the life of scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, Anderson's picture has earned rave reviews and thus fear appears to be sidestepping the controversy of its torrid subject matter.</p> <p>At a packed press conference, the director admitted that he had screened the film to the Hollywood actor Tom Cruise, an ardent advocate of scientology who acted in Anderson's 1999 film Magnolia.</p> <p>\"Yes, I have shown him the film and yes, we are still friends,\" the director said. \"The rest is between me and Tom.\"</p>",
  "<p>Is Bruce Willis just like the rest of us? Did he, too, click on \"I Agree\" without reading the small print when buying music on iTunes? It has been reported that Willis is cross that he isn't legally entitled to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/03/bruce-willis-apple-itunes-library\" title=\"\">bequeath his digital music collection</a>, held on his \"many, many iPods\", to his children when he dies.

Whatever the truth, it raises an interesting issue.</p> <p>\"A lot of people will get a similar shock when they realise this is the situation,\" says Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns for digital rights. \"There will soon be a lot of upset customers, not just for Apple, but also for Amazon and all the other companies selling digital content, such as books, which operate these licence agreements. We have no rights over the digital goods we buy. The laws were written to prevent piracy, but treat everyone as a thief.\"</p> <p>Joshy Thomas, an intellectual property lawyer, says that most iTunes users probably don't realise that when they pay for content all they're actually doing is paying for an assurance they won't be sued for having that file on their computers. \"Say I own a horse. I can give you permission to ride it every Tuesday, but it is still my property. It also doesn't mean your child has permission to ride it every Tuesday after your death. This is the situation as it stands. Apple could fix this tomorrow, though, by simply changing its small print.\"</p> <p>Thomas says the issue of who owns our \"digital footprint\" has been growing for a while now: \"People are just starting to talk about this. For example, what happens to our Facebook page when we die? Or our email archive? Willis needs to tread carefully, though. By forcing a change in licensing agreements, he could potentially rob his fellow artists of income. Apple is only the middle-man here.\"</p>",
  "<p>Les Ebdon sounds as if he is about to tackle an unexploded bomb. The new director of the <a href=\"http://www.offa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Office for Fair Access</a> (Offa), designed to ensure that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds get a decent chance to attend university, speaks hesitantly and softly.</p> <p>I was told by a former colleague of \"a tendency to speak first and think afterwards\". Ebdon has a reputation for provocative comments about, for example, medical schools, which he once described as \"full of very earnest young people from middle-class backgrounds\" who wouldn't serve in working-class areas. But now he talks like a malfunctioning speak-your-weight machine. For past indiscretions he pleads amnesia on a scale pioneered by Rupert Murdoch's executives. As vice-chancellor of <a href=\"http://www.beds.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Bedfordshire University</a>, he once stood (unsuccessfully) for the presidency of Universities UK, a position normally held by heads of posher universities, on a \"change you need\" platform. What change? What did his manifesto say? \"I can't remember.\" Nor can he remember <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/sep/21/tuitionfees.students50\" title=\"\">a Guardian questionnaire</a> he completed in 2004 in which he described Offa as \"a complete red herring\".</p> <p>You can't blame him. Few subjects arouse such passions in Britain as suggestions that children of middle-class parents may be cheated out of university places by oiks from the lower orders with inferior A-levels. Offa was created by Labour to placate its backbenchers when universities were first allowed in 2004 to charge variable fees, raising the danger of students from poor homes being deterred from entering elite institutions, particularly Oxford and Cambridge. Most Tories think it should be abolished.</p> <p>When Vince Cable, the Lib Dem business secretary, and David Willetts, the dampish Tory universities minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/09/vince-cable-university-access-tsar\" title=\"\">appointed Ebdon as director</a>, Tory backbenchers were furious. The vice-chancellor of an old-established redbrick or even of a former polytechnic with a conventional spread of degrees might have been acceptable. But Ebdon's Bedfordshire has no history, no physics, no foreign languages. It specialises in media studies, sports coaching, computer games, nursing, social work, fashion and similar new-fangled subjects. Worse, the A-levels typically required for entry are the second lowest in the country and it recruits more than 99% of its students from state schools, 70% from backgrounds that qualify them for financial aid.</p> <p>A torrent of press abuse followed. Ebdon was a \"grey-minded, platitude-spouting, pro-tokenism trundler\" (Mail), \"the epitome, the creme de la condensed milk of the cult of educational mediocrity\" (Telegraph). When they ran out of insulting adjectives, newspapers noted shapeless suits and loud ties and trained fire on Bedfordshire's \"dumbed-down\" courses. Having questioned Ebdon and struggled (it reported) \"to get a clear picture of [his] strategy\", a select committee of MPs tried to block his appointment. Cable refused to budge, despite being accused by one Tory MP of \"moving the agenda of social engineering forward and the agenda of merit backward\". This week, Ebdon starts work.</p> <p>I met him as he was moving out of his offices in Luton, headquarters of Bedfordshire University. The abuse must have been bruising and demoralising? \"It was tough, but it made me even more determined to do the job. It's an important job.\"</p> <p>How is it important? \"It's important to people who aspire to university; to universities, which need access to the full pool of excellence; and to the country which, in a competitive world where we need brains and creativity, must encourage youngsters from every background.\"</p> <p>How will he set about this important work? \"Universities are autonomous organisations that control their own admissions. Offa's job is to see that they set themselves challenging targets for widening entry. They have \u00a3800m to spend on access programmes \u2013 summer schools and so on \u2013and it's important that we evaluate them, see which are working and share good practice.\"</p> <p>Which all sounds sensible and consensual. But what it amounts to in practice causes furious debate. As Ebdon says, the proportion of students from poor homes is increasing across the university system \u2013 \"if we took average figures, we could pat ourselves on the back\" \u2013 but not in the elite universities, which lead to the most highly paid, prestigious and powerful jobs. If anything, the chances of a disadvantaged student, relative to an advantaged one, getting to a top university have deteriorated. Ebdon emphasizes the importance of raising aspirations among state-school pupils and teachers. \"A lot of teachers don't encourage even their brightest pupils to go to the most selective universities,\" he says. He was the first member of his family to attend university and he knows how often ordinary people say \"university is not for the likes of us\".</p> <p>But, I suggest, they have a point since, as a <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/elite-schools-dominate-admissions-to-top-universities/\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust report</a> revealed in 2008, a third of all admissions to Oxbridge are from just 100 schools, only two of them comprehensives (in name only), with Westminster, Eton, St Paul's Girls and Winchester accounting for more than 150 Oxford entrants each year. No amount of \"outreach\" can make that a less daunting prospect for a student from a northern comprehensive. Wasn't something more dramatic needed, such as setting quotas for state-school pupils or requiring lower grades from their pupils, thus allowing the numbers from under-privileged backgrounds to reach a critical mass?</p> <p>Ebdon ruled out quotas: \"Universities want academic excellence and they should look at academic indicators.\" He was more sympathetic to \"using contextual data\", which means accepting lower grades from applicants from disadvantaged areas or struggling schools. \"Where it's based on sound research, which shows the data helps to identify potential, it should be used.\" At Bristol, as Offa reported in 2010, students from \"low-performing\" schools, accepted with grades ABB rather than the AAAs required of other applicants, \"are likely to perform equally well once admitted\". But, Ebdon says, research at Cambridge is \"less compelling\", possibly because of the statistical effects of its narrower range of A-level scores. That, I suggest, is another example of how a bold solution is needed: nobody can know how disadvantaged students perform at Oxbridge until significant numbers get places. Ebdon says only that he will tell each university \"to develop your own strategies to meet the particular challenges you face\".</p> <p>Even if Ebdon favoured quotas, he lacks powers to impose them. Indeed, some doubt he has any effective powers, which explains why several other vice-chancellors turned the job down. \"I saw it as having a very marginal impact, particularly under the present government,\" said one. \"Les has set himself up,\" said a supporter of widening participation who also declined the job. \"Almost anything he does will upset Oxbridge while being far from what I would want.\" Ebdon spoke to the MPs' committee of using \"the nuclear option\" \u2013 limiting what a university can charge in annual fees \u2013 but does not demur when I point out that the cold war showed that a nuclear option can never be used. \"Offa has never used any sanctions. But there have been some strong negotiations and I would expect that to continue if universities don't set themselves challenging enough targets or don't meet them.\"</p> <p>Ebdon was born in north London in 1947. His parents became Baptists after his father, a local authority accountant, \"had a very profound conversion experience\" and Ebdon himself is a Baptist lay preacher. When he was six, the family moved to Hemel Hempstead new town in Hertfordshire. A sickly child who constantly went down with bronchitis, he flourished in the cleaner air. He went to the local grammar school and then to Imperial College, London, where he took a BSc and PhD in chemistry. His first lecturing job took him \u2013 partly because of altruistic instincts towards the developing world \u2013 to Makerere University, Uganda, during Idi Amin's rule. He returned home after two years, because \"my mother was very ill and reports of what was happening in Uganda caused her considerable anxiety\".</p> <p>He moved into what were then the polytechnics, lecturing at Sheffield and later Plymouth. His research output was prodigious, totalling 270 papers, which put him in the top 10 of the world's most cited chemists, and he got \u00a32.6m in research funding. He acknowledges the help of doctoral and post-doctoral students, many of whom, he says, came from unpromising backgrounds and \"it was then I realised there's a lot of potential out there that our universities don't reach\". He became deputy director at Plymouth (deputy vice-chancellor when it achieved university status) and, from 2003, vice-chancellor at Luton University, then considered a bit of a joke or, as Ebdon puts it, \"a very challenging situation\". But he transformed a \u00a3134m deficit into a healthy surplus and, with an extra campus in Bedford and a name change to University of Bedfordshire, increased student numbers from 3,000 to 25,000.</p> <p>He is hailed in the university sector as a success, recognised by his accession to the chairmanship of the Million+ universities group. True, Bedfordshire languishes in the lower half of league tables (82nd out of 116 in one, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2012/may/21/university-league-table-2013\" title=\"\">103rd out of 120</a> in another), but it beats several former polys and a post-1992 university was never going to challenge the Durhams and Exeters. The Quality Assurance Agency issued a critical report in 2005, but warmly praised academic standards and students' learning opportunities four years later.</p> <p>So was the university unfairly denigrated in the controversy over Ebdon's appointment? When I mention how newspapers sneered at several courses, Ebdon first says they were inventions. And it is true that none of Bedfordshire's students takes a degree in either of the Mail's favourite targets, breastfeeding counselling, and beauty therapy and spa management. But as Ebdon then explains, the university validates diplomas in those subjects, offered respectively by the National Childbirth Trust and a local FE college. Moreover, they are listed online among Bedfordshire's undergraduate courses and it is nowhere stated explicitly that they are studied elsewhere. One suspects that the university and its vice-chancellor have sometimes been a touch too keen to promote a reputation for inclusivity.</p> <p>Ebdon, I think, is driven by religious faith and good intentions, not by politics. Unlike Bill Rammell, the former minister who succeeds him at Bedfordshire as vice-chancellor, he has no formal Labour connections. But the select committee \u2013 though influenced mainly by the prejudices of its Tory majority \u2013 perhaps had a point when it deemed him wrong for the job. After all, he has often been as dismissive of elite universities as they and their supporters are of him. As chairman of Million+, he argued that ministers concentrated too much on Oxbridge. They should, he said, build up new universities, which had a record of admitting students from diverse backgrounds and launching them into leading export industries such as biosciences, computer games and creative arts.</p> <p>Ebdon, said one former colleague, was \"far and away the best spokesman the post-1992 universities ever had\". It remains to be seen if he has sufficient conviction and political skills to be an equally effective advocate for getting disadvantaged students into Oxford and Cambridge.</p>",
  "<p>Arms outstretched, mouth open wide with sheer delight and disbelief, it was for many the abiding image of the Olympics: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18912882\" title=\"\">Mo Farah sailing to his second gold medal victory</a>, to the roars of a newly adoring nation.</p> <p>For members of the UK's Somali community it was, by all accounts, a particularly special moment. Like many Somali children arriving in the UK's schools, Farah had battled with a language barrier. He had struggled academically, been taunted by classmates for his outsider status, and was prone to getting into fights. Now he was being embraced as a British hero.</p> <p>\"I was overwhelmed,\" says Mubarak Ismail, a volunteer mentor to Somali children in Sheffield. \"I felt so happy; it was incredible, unbelievable. The young people were even more excited. They were talking a lot about how we were like him; they like to see someone they can be proud of. They were all putting his picture on their Facebook pages, texting each other saying: 'Did you see Mo?'\"</p> <p>Teachers and community workers hope they'll be able to harness that enthusiasm and confidence in their efforts to address the long-standing problem of Somali pupils' underachievement. The Department for Education's statistics on attainment aren't broken down into ethnic groups beyond broad categories like \"Black African\", so there is no national data on how Somali pupils are faring.</p> <p>But in 2010 a report for the then <a href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/DCSF-RR226.pdf\" title=\"\">Department for Children, Schools and Families</a> estimated that while the 2007 national figure for pupils getting five GCSEs at A*-C including English and maths was 45%, for Somalis it was just 24%.</p> <p>Their achievement levels were much lower than the Black African average, the report said. In Sheffield, Ismail says, there are individuals achieving high grades, but on average Somali attainment still lags behind other groups.</p> <p>\"Mo will be a talking point in schools this term, especially in those with significant numbers of Somali pupils,\" says Asha Ali, a Cardiff teacher and the founder and director of <a href=\"http://www.sef-cymru.com/\" title=\"\">SEF Cymru</a> , a voluntary organisation that has offered out-of-hours educational support for young Somalis for 12 years. \"He's such a great role model and ambassador for young Somalis \u2013 he has put them on the map in a positive way.\"</p> <p>At SEF Cymru, Ali will be encouraging teachers to build work on Farah's achievements into lessons, and getting pupils to create displays celebrating \u2013 and sharing \u2013 his success. \"The main message has to be that determination and hard work gets you where you want to be,\" she says.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.springfield.sheffield.sch.uk/\" title=\"\">Springfield primary school</a> in Sheffield, where 30-35% of pupils are Somali, the headteacher, Beth Stevenson, is envisaging assemblies exploring Farah's background. \"His life journey is such a good story to support kids in just sticking at it,\" she says. \"He left Somalia to make a new life, and that's what most of my families are here for. He conformed to the stereotype quite a bit, in having language difficulties and getting in trouble \u2013 but he absolutely broke through that.</p> <p>\"But it won't just be what we can teach them, it will be about what family experiences they bring. It's very important that the kids can reflect. We will probably have a display up asking 'who is this man, where has he come from, what can we learn from him?'. We can talk to children, but they need to learn it for themselves.\"</p> <p>Young Somalis can often feel in limbo in the UK, Ismail says, especially when some members of the older generation have dreams of returning to Somalia. \"They will see [from Farah's success] that they belong to this country, that they need to achieve things here,\" he says. \"That's very important.\"</p> <p>At the offices of the <a href=\"http://www.islingtonsomalicommunity.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Islington Somali Community</a> (ISC) organisation in Finsbury Park, north London, staff believe work like theirs \u2013 providing extra lessons in maths, English and Somali language, and helping parents to understand the British education system \u2013 has contributed to improved attainment in recent years. Young Somalis there who are about to go to university say they had no issues at school.</p> <p>But problems persist, says Abdullahi Awale, a tutor at the centre who works with primary school pupils \u2013 often because parents don't have the English language skills, time or education to help children with homework. They may not realise the value of after-school clubs either. Without that input, it's easy for children to fall behind.</p> <p>\"You see some pupils in year 5 who still don't understand year-2 or -3 work,\" Awale says. \"Pupils lose self-confidence in class; they don't have much ambition. They think they can't learn. They say 'it's hard, I can't do it, I hate it'.\"</p> <p>A lack of role models can also be a problem: \"If they don't see teachers and staff from their country they might feel they can't do well. I had one boy saying 'my father is a taxi driver so I'll be a taxi driver'.\"</p> <p>Respondents to a <a href=\"www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1210847.pdf\" title=\"\">Department for Communities and Local Government</a> study on the Somali community in England, published in 2009, identified a lack of role models, especially male ones, as one of the key causes of crime among young Somali men, with boys described by many in the community as a \"lost generation\".</p> <p>The children who do well are those who've had teachers motivating and supporting them, Ismail says \u2013 as did Farah, whose athletic talents were spotted and nurtured by <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/london-2012-legacy-mo-farah-1234952\" title=\"\">PE teacher Alan Watkinson</a>. But he says many young people feel they're not given enough encouragement to aim high.</p> <p>\"Teachers have a great role to play,\" he says. \"The problems are when they are overburdened \u2013 they've got so many things to deal with at the same time.\"</p> <p>Omer Ahmed, the director of the <a href=\"http://councilofsomaliorgs.com/\" title=\"\">Council of Somali Organisations</a>, says the best thing about Farah's new status is what it will do for the self-confidence of young Somalis, battered by media coverage linking their community to bogus benefit claimants, terrorism, pirates and famine.</p> <p>\"It's got to the stage where some Somali kids are trying to deny that they're Somali because of the embarrassment, and that has been more damaging for them than anything else.</p> <p>\"The most powerful image wasn't Mo Farah crossing the line \u2013 it was watching British society celebrating a young Somali man wrapped in the Union Jack.\"</p>",
  "<p>A man suspected of being part of a plot to rip off a Colombian drug gang at gunpoint was killed by an armed police officer who shot him six times in seconds without issuing an oral warning, an inquiry has heard.</p> <p>The officer known only as E7 opened fire less than one second after pulling alongside a car carrying Azelle Rodney, 24, who was in a rear seat.</p> <p>A public inquiry chaired by a former high court judge, Sir Christopher Holland, began on Monday into the shooting which took place on 20 April 2005 in Mill Hill, north London.</p> <p>Rodney's family have fought a seven-year battle for a public and full inquiry into his death. The authorities had previously said this would not be possible because the intelligence used by law enforcement came from intercepts, whose disclosure to lawyers and the family was claimed to be unlawful.</p> <p>The police operation followed intelligence from Customs and Excise that a gang would stage an armed heist against Colombian drug pushers on the streets of London, and steal their class A drugs.</p> <p>The sensitive intelligence in this case, was one of the reasons that the last Labour government and then the current Conservative-led coalition considered introducing so called \"secret inquests\".</p> <p>The intelligence in the Rodney case was passed to the Metropolitan police, which decided against arresting the men before they were in possession of firearms because they would not have sufficient evidence to prosecute them. Internal police documents made public on Monday show senior officers believed they needed to confront the gang once they were in possession of weapons to best reduce the danger to the public and to officers.</p> <p>The case raises several issues about police use of deadly force, including whether police can open fire without seeing a suspect threatening them with a weapon, and the role of intelligence in a firearms officer's mind when assessing the level of threat posed by a suspect.</p> <p>An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission exonerated the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was no criminal case for police to answer.</p> <p>Opening the inquiry, Ashley Underwood QC, said officer E7 pulled alongside side Rodney as part of a hard stop by police, forcing the Volkswagen Golf he was travelling to halt as officers in three cars boxed the suspect's vehicle in.</p> <p>Underwood said: \"Within less than a second of the car containing the officer coming to a halt, he opened fire with a carbine. He fired eight shots rapidly. Of these, six shots hit Mr Rodney. He was killed more or less instantly.\"</p> <p>Underwood said weapons were recovered from the silver Golf. One could not fire and was located under some yellow plastic on the rear seat. A pistol was recovered from the vehicle's rear footwell, wrapped inside a scarf inside a rucksack containing four rounds, and thirdly, in the same rucksack was a gun that looked like a key fob which contained two rounds of ammunition.</p> <p>Internal police documents about the operation say it was possible the gang that police believed Rodney was part of might have been armed with a machine gun.</p> <p>Tests carried out for the inquiry show that E7 had sight of Rodney for 0.88 seconds before starting to fire.</p> <p>Two men in the car were later convicted for firearms offences.</p> <p>Rodney's mother, Susan Alexander, was in court to hear the evidence, with family members leaving briefly when gruesome photographs of the aftermath of the shooting were shown.</p> <p>The dead man's family fought plans for an inquest into the death to be held, in which secret evidence would be withheld from them and their lawyers.</p> <p>Underwood praised Ms Alexander's \"dignity\" and her \"reasonable and positive approach\" which helped the inquiry navigate complex legal obstacles to get started.</p> <p>Underwood also praised the Met for their assistance and help in providing documents to explain the planning of the operation and its tactics.</p> <p>Firearms officers will testify in coming weeks, as will intelligence officers. Their evidence will be open to the public but their identities will be protected.</p> <p>The inquiry heard that one option considered was arresting those suspected of planning the heist for lesser offences. Rodney was a suspect in an earlier serious assault but this was not known to officers trying to stop what they considered was an imminent armed robbery.</p> <p>The inquiry continues, and is expected to last 10 weeks.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/aug/16/classicalmusicandopera.edinburgh2006\" title=\"\">Calixto Bieito</a>'s rehearsal room is in a state of chaos. A huge pile of soil has been tipped over the floor; actors writhe and squirm through the mulch beneath a blasted tree festooned with red balloons. It looks like a cross between a garden centre, a children's party and one of Samuel Beckett's bleaker visions.</p> <p>It is in fact the setting for Bieito's latest work, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3f9b4NFM7s\" title=\"\">Forests</a> \u2013 a piece for which the unpredictable but often brilliant Catalan director has scoured the works of Shakespeare for every mention of a wood, a copse or a bosky glade, and cut-and-pasted them into an epic, arboreal mash-up.</p> <p>Forests isn't quite Shakespeare. Then again, critics argued that Bieito's infamous staging of Macbeth, seen at the Barbican in 2003, wasn't quite Shakespeare either. Bieito rarely approaches any text without taking his scissors out. \"It's not a crime\", he said. \"I'm not a doctor, cutting off arms and legs. It's only a play\". Bieito's reputation was sealed when the curtain rose on his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8omChPHURU\" title=\"\">2002 English National Opera production of Verdi's A Masked Ball</a> to reveal a row of 14 men sitting in a public lavatory with their trousers around their ankles. Since then he has recast Mozart's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/sep/29/arts.artsnews\" title=\"\">Don Giovanni as a gun-toting junkie</a> and turned his Abduction from the Seraglio into a blood-soaked splatter opera with singer-on-singer urination and a necrophiliac climax.</p> <p>Now 48, he shows no sign of slowing down. Last January he produced a version of <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/02/over-the-top-with-calixo-bieito/\" title=\"\">Weber's Der Freisch\u00fctz in Berlin</a> which required a leading tenor to remain naked throughout, while his version of Camino Real in Chicago departed so radically from Tennessee Williams's script that the New Yorker's critic complained: \"<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/theatre/2012/03/26/120326crth_theatre_lahr?currentPage=2\" title=\"\">It's a bit like crushing a Mercedes into a block of steel and calling it a luxury car.</a>\"</p> <p>Yet even his detractors generally admit that Bieito's productions display fierce intelligence and a highly original stylistic vision. It is simply the expression, he says, of his Catalan background. \"My black humour comes from Cervantes. My surrealism comes from <a href=\"http://www.luisbunuel.com/\" title=\"\">Bu\u00f1uel</a>. My images come from Goya, and my terror came from being taught by Jesuits. I learned to live with fear from a very early age.\" He turns out to be a thoughtful and courteous figure who conducts rehearsals in a voice that rarely rises above a murmur. One actor warms up with a handstand, which leads the director to suggest that he deliver his next speech upside-down. Another member of the Anglo-Catalan cast struggles to meet the demand that she recite a Shakespearean sonnet while playing Handel's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TGKJ9MgCOQ\" title=\"\">Arrival of the Queen of Sheba</a> at the same time: \"It's impossible\" she says, after several tries.</p> <p>\"You will do it,\" Bieito insists.</p> <p>\"You crazy Catalan bastard.\"</p> <p>\"Thank you.\"</p> <p>It's meant in jest, though there does seem to be a degree of perplexity as to what Forests is supposed to be about. (Bieito says that the work does have a thematic structure, but it is not important for the audience to understand it.)</p> <p>So what inspired this strange Shakespearean medley in the first place? \"There was a two-year period in which I did Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear in five different languages,\" Bieito explains. \"I said after King Lear I would stop. But when Birmingham Rep asked me to do this project, they told me I could do anything I liked. So I read Shakespeare again.\"</p> <p>All of it? \"All of it. I found myself reading themes. I became fascinated with how often Shakespeare's characters go into the forest. In Shakespeare, the forest can be many things: a place of self-discovery, a place of magic, a place of darkness. I tried to shape this work as if it were a symphonic poem. You don't have to understand the whole plot. What matters is the strength of the images and the music of the text.\"</p> <p>In lieu of a conventional storyline, Bieito has conceived the work in three parts corresponding to paradise, purgatory and the inferno: \"The first part is about childhood and innocence. The second part is about the loss of that innocence and man's discovery of the brutality within himself. The final part is a crazy fantasy of violence and destruction, a descent into the apocalypse.\" There will be blood? \"Yes. I don't understand why people get so scandalised by this. Shakespeare's theatre was full of poetry, full of blood, full of violence.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395599040\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/3/1346692749275/A-scene-from-Calixto-Biei-008.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Calixto Bieito's Forests\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Calixto Bieito's Forests.

There's also reference to Timon of Athens' woodland hide-out, where the hero, driven to madness by the ingratitude of his so-called friends, declares that \"our Commonwealth has become a forest of beasts\".</p> <p>Does Bieito perceive a parallel between Timon's disaffection and the current economic crisis?</p> <p>\"Absolutely. Timon is the allegory of&nbsp;what happens when the money vanishes. We revert to animal instinct. There is no morality.\" What of his own country? He sighs. \"I am worried about Spain. Spain is a very unhappy country. The problem&nbsp;is more than just economic. It's the problem of a country which refuses&nbsp;to&nbsp;accept the last century of its&nbsp;history.\"</p> <p>After 11 years as artistic director of Barcelona's most venerable theatrical institution, the Teatre Romea, Bieito resigned two years ago to form a new, flexible, non-building-based organisation, <a href=\"http://www.bitbarcelona.com/en/the-project/\" title=\"\">Barcelona Internacional Teatre</a>. Forests is the first BIT production to originate in Britain: Bieito hopes it won't be the last.</p> <p>\"I feel welcome here, even when people boo me,\" he says. Even the critical drubbing bounces off. \"I don't think too much about it. There are far more important things to worry about \u2013 such as the situation in my country.

  "<p>An investigation is expected to continue on Tuesday into the cause of a fire at Luca Cumani's stables in Newmarket on Monday that required the attendance of more than 30 firefighters. No horses or humans were injured though it took some hours for the fire to be brought under control after smoke was spotted billowing from under the tiles at his Bedford House yard.</p> <p>Suffolk fire and rescue service reported that the fire was still being contained at 4.30pm, more than five hours after fire engines arrived at the scene, but an hour after that the relieved trainer announced that it was \"over and done with\". \"There's no major damage,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It affected the roof over a section of our stables but all the horses there were relocated in good order and no one was hurt. There was no drama or trauma, the fire services responded very promptly. We've just lost a section of the roof.\"</p> <p>Asked as to the cause of the fire, Cumani said: \"There are speculations about that but I don't want to speculate. We'll have to see what the fire service have to say.\"</p> <p>The trainer made a point of tweeting his thanks to the firefighters for \"an incredibly quick response and effective action\". His assistant, Olly Williams, tweeted a series of pictures of the fire and said that, had it taken hold one hour later, during the yard's lunch break, \"no one would have been there to get the horses out\".</p> <p>Cumani's yard was believed to have been the target of arsonists in 1997, when it caught fire on consecutive nights, though he said on Monday that the cause of those fires had never been proven. The trainer has owned the yard at Bedford House for more than 30 years, during which time it has enjoyed consistent success, housing two Derby winners among other high-profile horses.</p> <p>Mount Athos and Quest For Peace are due to represent the trainer in November's prestigious Melbourne Cup, a race he has twice come within inches of winning. He said on Monday that both horses were due to enter quarantine next week.</p> <p>Johnny Murtagh's relationship with the trainer John Oxx appears undamaged by last week's news that the rider was fired from his post as first jockey to the Aga Khan. Oxx said on Monday that, while he cannot book Murtagh for the Aga Khan's horses, he will continue to use him on runners belonging to other owners, including Born To Sea in Saturday's Irish Champion Stakes</p> <p>\"He was not retained by anybody other than the Aga Khan, so he is effectively a freelance now,\" the trainer said. \"He can choose what he wants to ride, but hopefully he'll be on a good few of ours for the rest of this season.\" Murtagh has been out of action since 12 August, when a bone beneath one eye was fractured in a pre-race accident but Oxx reports that he has been riding work and hopes to be passed fit to ride on Tuesday or Wednesday. \"I think he'd quite like to ride on Wednesday [at Gowran Park], so he is nice and sharp for the weekend.\"</p> <p>The Irish Champion appears likely to attract a high-quality field, a dozen potential runners standing their ground at Monday's entry stage, half of them from the Aidan O'Brien stable, whose main representative is likely to be St Nicholas Abbey or Imperial Monarch. It is a decade since the race was last won by a horse based in England but the betting is headed by two from Newmarket, Nathaniel at 13-8 and Snow Fairy at 3-1.</p> <p>The chance to see what will probably be the final outing by another of Newmarket's finest, Frankel, has boosted advance sales for Ascot's Champions Day on 20 October, to the point where Premier Enclosure tickets sold out on Monday. Officials at the track report that \"plenty\" of tickets remain for the grandstand area but that sales are expected to reach 30,000 at some point this week.</p> <p>Extra capacity will be needed to accommodate extra racegoers beyond that point and Ascot staff are due to consider their options on that score later this week.</p> <p>British racing is to renew its experiment with matinee racing, some eight years after a handful of Saturday meetings were held early in the hope of attracting betting shop punters placing their football coupons at that time. Six matinee fixtures will be held on Fridays from 21 September to 26 October, the action starting at around noon.</p> <p>The fixtures are among 10 additional meetings staged to make up for the loss of so many cards since June during the unusually wet summer. Betting data will be examined after they have taken place and will guide officials as to whether more use should be made of matinees in future.</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic national convention in Charlotte culminates with Barack Obama's acceptance speech on Thursday night. Before then, the convention will feature a mix of fresh and familiar faces. Here are six worth watching:</p> <h2>Julian Castro: the rising star</h2> <p><strong>Why he is there:</strong> appeals to crucial Latino voters in swing states</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602326\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346686134224/Julian-Castro-004.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Castro\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Castro.

Their mother Rosie is a longtime political activist.</p> <h2>Eva Longoria: the Hollywood glamour</h2> <p><strong>Why:</strong> combines star power and immigration reform message</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602327\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346686090224/Eva-Longoria-004.jpg\" alt=\"Eva Longoria\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eva Longoria.

The Emmy-winning actor is the daughter of a Mexican American family that lived in Texas long before it was subsumed by the US. Longoria has spoken out in favour of liberal immigration reform, and against the draconian anti-immigrant laws enacted in Arizona.</p> <h2>Elizabeth Warren: the liberal lion</h2> <p><strong>Why:</strong> support for grassroots favourite in critical election battle</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602328\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346686021951/Elizabeth-Warren-004.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Warren\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren.

Warren's calls to restore sanity to the financial system and stiffer regulations for Wall Street saw her passed over as head of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But she bounced back by winning the Democratic nomination to contest the US Senate seat in Massachusetts held by Republican Scott Brown.</p> <h2>Bill Clinton: the political rock star</h2> <p><strong>Why:</strong> erstwhile opponent turned trusted ally able to woo independent voters</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602329\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346686320062/Bill-Clinton-and-Barack-O-004.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

After Republicans in Congress barred Fluke from speaking at a hearing on contraception and healthcare reform, Democrats invited her to a high-profile event. That aroused the fury of talkshow host Limbaugh, who attacked the law student as a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\". The ensuing outrage cost Limbaugh an apology and a string of dropped advertisers, and made Fluke into a national figure.</p> <h2>Martin O'Malley: the 2016 hopeful</h2> <p><strong>Why:</strong> popular state governor as high-profile party leader</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602331\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346693491968/Martin-OMalley-004.jpg\" alt=\"Martin O'Malley\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin O'Malley.

Hillary Clinton's job as secretary of state keeps her away from Charlotte, but Martin O'Malley, the governor of Maryland, is in the front-rank of candidates if she decides not to run. O'Malley made his name as a crusading mayor of Baltimore and in 2006 ousted the Republican incumbent as governor. He comfortably won re-election in 2010 in an otherwise tough year for Democrats, and boasts liberal stances on gay marriage and taxation.</p>",
  "<p>Two universities had their licenses to admit overseas students temporarily suspended after the UK Border Agency discovered problems with the enforcement of visa rules, ministers have said.</p> <p>London Metropolitan University was stripped of its highly trusted sponsor status last week after checks by UKBA found breaches of visa rules. Audits found that of a sample of 101 overseas students at London Met, a quarter had no leave to remain in the UK.</p> <p>UKBA carried out a further sample check of 600 overseas students at London Met, which found problems in 60% of cases, MPs were told.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons in response to an urgent question about London Met, the immigration minister Damian Green said that both of the other institutions had resolved their problems and were no longer suspended.</p> <p>The minister said London Met's case was more serious. He said: \"UKBA found systemic failures which meant that London Met had not been able to ensure the appropriate admission and tracking of students from abroad.\"</p> <p>Allowing London Met to continue awarding visas would have undermined the visa regime, Green added.</p> <p>\"Institutions must comply with the rules, whether they sponsor 10, 100 or 1,000 international students. This includes having a system to check that students have the right visas to study in the UK and monitoring the attendance of students,\" the minister told MPs.</p> <p>\"Education providers have to meet strict standards ensuring they provide high quality education and take their immigration responsibilities seriously.\"</p> <p>Officials will start writing to affected students on 1 October, giving them 60 days to leave the UK or find another university to complete their studies. The decision leaves 2,700 foreign students at London Met facing deportation.</p> <p>The government accused the university of \"failing to address serious and systemic failings\" identified six months ago.</p> <p>Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, who tabled the Commons question, said the London Met decision would deter foreign students from studying in the UK.</p> <p>\"The image around the world is one that is really quite appalling because it suggests that overseas students may well be deported from this country because of a decision made by UKBA for which there is no detail given as to the basis of that decision.</p> <p>\"Every university in this country has cause to be concerned by this decision from UKBA.\"</p> <p>Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said Labour supported the crackdown on bogus courses but warned the government needed to support legitimate students.</p> <p>He said: \"We need to foster an international reputation for high value education, not undermine it.</p> <p>\"The government has acted at the most disruptive time of year in the most disruptive way - yet more ministerial incompetence. Legitimate international students bring in \u00a33.3bn in to this country's economy.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats also criticised the move. Mike Crockart, MP for Edinburgh West, accused UKBA of \"heavy-handed, rhetoric-induced action\".</p> <p>But Green said the decision to act against London Met was the \"opposite of rhetoric\". He said: \"Instead of years of immigration ministers from the previous government talking tough and acting weak, we now have a government that is acting tough as well.\"</p>",
  "<p>Another night, another gold, another world record \u2013 and just her second of the day \u2013 for the phenomenon that is Ellie Simmonds. If her first win on Saturday night was a draining duel against the American Victoria Arlen then this, her fourth Paralympic gold, was a remorseless display of power and nerve.</p> <p>A savage acceleration in the final freestyle leg of the SM6 200m medley took her home almost nine seconds clear of Germany's Verena Schott, who in turn pipped Britain's Natalie Jones to silver.</p> <p>For Simmonds it is almost becoming routine. Her four-medal target remains on course, to be resumed on Tuesday in the 50m freestyle where Arlen again awaits, with the set complete on Saturday in the 100m freestyle.</p> <p>\"I knew I was on form this morning,\" she said of her world record in qualifying, from which she knocked off another second and a half on Monday night. \"Tonight, I'm just so excited, so pleased and so happy.</p> <p>\"It's the biggest event of my life and I just want to go out there and do my best in every race.\" And she is far from done yet. \"At this point I need my privacy, I need my space and just need to focus on my races. I've got my 50 free tomorrow so I'll just be focusing now.\"</p> <p>Simmonds has become used to various adjectival flourishes in her direction but perhaps the most succinct was provided by Jones, her team-mate and bronze medallist here. \"She's flippin' hard, she's just hard. I knew it wasn't going to be gold but Ellie's just streets ahead of me. I do try my hardest but I can't compete with her, I really can't.\"</p> <p>It was said wistfully, without a trace of bitterness. Jones is 27 and has achieved her ambition of a medal at these Games. Simmonds is 17 and patently improving with each race.</p> <p>It is one of the curiosities of Paralympic competition that athletes of such startlingly different physical attributes find themselves together on the start blocks. Most of Simmonds's opponents tower over her as they line up, and on Monday night her 4ft frame was sandwiched in lane four between two relative amazons in Jones and Schott. Perhaps this is why a five-year-old Simmonds took to swimming with such precocity. She recalls in her early memories of the sport a fiery determination to keep up with able-bodied schoolfriends and such was her progress that her first selection for a senior British squad came at the age of 12. Less than two years later she was a double Paralympic gold medallist.</p> <p>If being born with achondroplasia ordained a life of looking upwards to others, in the pool she can literally and figuratively stare rivals in the eye. Last night she was a piranha among dolphins and watching her strip away a deficit in the final leg, after the Ukrainian Oksana Khrul had built up a significant lead, was to reinforce the perception of a predator in the Paralympic pool.</p> <p>The frenzied thrash of freestyle is her natural metier but the four disciplines of the medley provide a much stiffer challenge. Simmonds's backstroke is not bad, but the sinuous lower-body movement that propels a swimmer through the butterfly and breaststroke leaves her at a natural disadvantage to a much taller rival. She was fifth after the butterfly, picked up one place during the backstroke, and after 150m still had a full two-second deficit to Khrul.</p> <p>\"It is scary when you see Oksana, who's a great breastroker, go in front of you but I know my advantages, and I know that I'd normally overtake her on the front crawl,\" she said. \"I go out there and I control my race, I talk with Billy [Pye] my coach beforehand about what my race tactics are so I just go out there and swim the best that I can.\"</p> <p>It seemed cruel in the extreme on Khrul, so strong in the butterfly and breaststroke but for whom lack of movement in the arms renders her a sitting duck at the finish. By way of comparison, Khrul swam her final leg in 56.23sec, Simmonds in 39.87.</p> <p>Along with Oscar Pistorius (well, until Sunday night anyway) and David Weir, Simmonds is the undoubted face of the Games. She does not, however, embrace the limelight and gives the impression of prizing her focus \"in the bubble\" above all else. A chance-your-arm question concerning whether she would \"like to have a pool party with Prince Harry\", in attendance here along with David Cameron, who presented her medal, was met with a puzzled look that suggested keeping up with the papers has not been a priority.</p> <p>Even to approach four golds will require similar tunnel vision, with Arlen and her old rival, the Dutch swimmer Mirjam de Koning-Peper, looming large.</p> <p>\"I'm just going to focus on myself,\" she said. \"I'm trying to keep myself in a bubble from the outside world. I've got my own targets and my own aim is to go out there and do personal bests.\"</p> <p>She has abstained from Facebook and Twitter during the Games, but news of the nation's reaction has nonetheless begun to filter back. \"Apparently 3.3m people watched my race [for her first gold] which is amazing not just for me but for getting the Paralympics out there and hopefully people out there will get inspired by us and get into sport. It's great that people are watching the Paralympics.\"</p> <p>They are and, more and more as the Games progress, they are watching Ellie Simmonds.</p>",
  "<p><em>Steven Hassan joined the Unification Church in the 1970s and was a member for more than two years. He now works </em><a href=\"http://www.freedomofmind.com/\" title=\"\"><em>as a counsellor</em></a><em> and has written books about cults and their techniques.</em></p> <p>I consider myself to be an independent thinker. I was an advanced honours student. I had skipped eighth grade. I cycled across the US when I was 16. I did not think I was vulnerable to being brainwashed by a cult.</p> <p>I was 19, and it was the beginning of the spring semester at college when three women, dressed like students, asked if they could sit at my table in the cafeteria. They were kind of flirting with me. I thought I was going to get a date.</p> <p>At some point they said they were part of a student movement, trying to make the world a better place. I said, \"Are you part of some sort of religious group?\" They said no. They also didn't say they were celibate and that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/moonies-sun-myung-moon-dies\" title=\"\">Reverend Moon</a> was going to match people and tell them when they could have sex. If they had, I would have said: \"You're crazy, leave me alone.\" I say this to highlight the point about deception: people don't knowingly join cults.</p> <p>Little did I know, within a few weeks I would be told to drop out of school, donate my bank account, look at Moon as my true parent, and believe my parents were Satan. I didn't even believe in Satan until I met the group.</p> <p>I hadn't heard of the Moonies and I&#xa0;didn't know about Moon himself until several weeks into my indoctrination. These new people picked me up on a Friday evening and drove me to a very expensive mansion, which turned out to be one of their headquarters. As we were driving through the gate, they said: \"By the way we're having a joint workshop with the Unification Church.\" I said nobody had told me about a workshop, or a church. They did the classic mind control technique \u2013 they turned it around and made it my issue. \"What's the matter?\" they said. \"Are you closed-minded?'</p> <p>I was put in a dormitory and couldn't sleep. I was planning to get out of there the next day, but morning came and I was told I had missed the van. They said I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't stay, and talked me into a 40-day separation, where I shouldn't communicate with my friends or family. </p> <p>Each evening we had to write feedback. At the end of the last day I remember writing: \"I am too blown away to write anything now.\" My mind was exploding. At lectures, they had \u00adintroduced the idea that all of human history was culminating, that God was sending the messiah and that the third world war was going to \u00adhappen in the next three years. What did I want to do? Did I want to be part of this great and glorious thing, or did I want to be selfish and go back to my little life?</p> <p>Within three months I was a cult leader. I got very deeply involved, and I&#xa0;got to the point where I was being told to think about what country I wanted to run when we took over the world.</p> <p>I was with the Moonies for two-and-a-half years. I worked 21 hours a&#xa0;day, seven days a week \u2013 in prayer for between one and three hours. Then I would spend the rest of the day doing PR or lectures for the group, recruiting and fundraising. Everyone on my team was told they had to raise a minimum of $100 a day, otherwise they wouldn't be allowed to sleep, and as a good leader, if they couldn't sleep, then I couldn't either. When I crashed a van into the back of a tractor trailer, I had gone three days without sleep.</p> <p>They gave me tapes of Moon's speeches to listen to in hospital when I was recovering from the crash, but you can only do that for so many hours in the day. Out of the controlled environment, I really missed my younger sister. I&#xa0;called her and told her I had been in an accident. She told the rest of my family</p> <p>They hired former members to do an intervention with me. It was a very difficult experience because I was programmed to fear Satan and anyone who criticised Moon. I thought it was a test of my faith and I was convinced I&#xa0;hadn't been brainwashed.</p> <p>My father started to weep at one point and said: \"What would you do if it was your son who had dropped out of college, cut off contact?\" I could feel he was was genuinely concerned about me, but it didn't mean I wanted to leave, or didn't think Moon was the Messiah. He asked me to listen to them for the next five days, and at the end if I still wanted to go back he would take me. I wanted to prove to them I wasn't brainwashed, but on the fifth day, as soon as I allowed the thought that Moon was a liar into my consciousness it was like a house of cards falling down. I was horrified.</p> <p>I didn't do anything for three months after the deprogramming. I just tried to work out who I was and what I believed. After three months, I realised I wanted to go public and expose it, which I have been doing ever since, writing books about how these groups work, and working as a therapist to protect people.</p> <p>Now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/moonies-sun-myung-moon-dies\">Moon is gone</a>, I'm \u00adconcerned that the cult will start generating \u00adstories about how he walked on water and raised dead people. My fear is that for the sake of the \u00adfranchise they will come \u00adtogether and promote Moon as a&#xa0;great being.<br></p>",
  "<h2>Oscar Pistorius came second in the T44 200m. So what's his problem?</h2> <p>The South African has been worried about the length of his rivals' prostheses for some time. Six weeks before the Paralympics began, he took the unusual step of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/03/oscar-pistorius-blade-length-ipc\" title=\"\">personally phoning the IPC's director of communications</a>, Craig Spence, to report rumours that a particular competitor was running with illegally long prosthetic limbs. The IPC investigated the runner in question \u2013 who was not Alan Oliveira, the 20-year-old Brazilian who stunned Pistorius to win gold in the 200m \u2013 and assured Pistorius that his rival was not flouting the IPC's regulations. The IPC says it believed that was the end of Pistorius's complaint but shortly before the Paralympics began, one of Pistorius's PR team warned the IPC that the South African would go public with his unease over the prosthesis rules during the Games. Oliveira's blades are legal, according to the IPC \u2013 but the Brazilian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/03/alan-oliveira-taller-blades-pistorius\" title=\"\">had them lengthened</a> recently.</p> <h2>What are the IPC's regulations for prostheses and blades?</h2> <p>Prostheses are \"adaptive equipment\" according to Peter Van de Vliet, the IPC's medical and scientific director: they are designed to restore a loss of function, not artificially enhance body length or performance. As <a href=\"http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120831090842500_2011_2012_IPC_Athletics_%2BRules_Regulations_updated_Mar%2B2012_0.pdf\" title=\"\">its rules</a> make clear, the IPC is committed to preventing the use of prostheses that lead to an \"unrealistic enhancement of stride length\".</p> <h2>How does the IPC calculate the acceptable lengths of prosthetic legs and feet?</h2> <p>Since 2007, the IPC has used a formula to calculate the permitted length of prostheses for its athletes. For double amputees such as Pistorius and Oliveira, this is based on measuring each athlete's body and arm span, and using this data to estimate their overall height if they had legs. Athletes are allowed prosthetic limbs and feet that make them up to 3.5% taller than their estimated height including the blade at the end of their prosthesis. Many able-bodied athletes are unusually long-limbed and this margin allows for natural variations in body types as well as the fact that athletes stand taller \u2013 on their toes \u2013 when they run.</p> <h2>Is this formula controversial?</h2> <p>Not until this week. According to Van de Vliet, athletes are routinely measured to check they are within the regulations, and to his knowledge there has never been a complaint about the current system.</p> <h2>How do Pistorius and Oliveira match up?</h2> <p>Pistorius runs at 1845mm (just over 6ft) but could under the IPC rules extend his prosthesis so he would stand 1935mm tall. For all the controversy over Oliveira's apparently height-enhancing prostheses, the Brazilian is not pushing at the upper limit of the IPC's rules. He now runs at 1810mm but could still extend to 1845mm under the IPC's formula.</p> <h2>Pistorius has stuck with the 'Cheetah' blades he is familiar with. Is he now at a disadvantage because of a sudden leap in prosthetic technology?</h2> <p>Both Pistorius and Oliveira use blades made by the same manufacturer, <a href=\"http://www.ossur.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ossur</a>. Athletes can use prostheses made by any manufacturer but Van de Vliet says there has not been any recent technological revolution. Pistorius has stuck with his blades because he has declared he is happy with them but also because he fought so hard to get them approved by the <a href=\"http://www.iaaf.org/mini/oly12/index.aspx\" title=\"\">International Association of Athletics Federations</a>. If he switched blades for the Paralympics, he would be open to accusations that he believes that they can, in fact, confer a physical advantage.</p> <h2>What advantage could a runner gain from longer prostheses?</h2> <p>Pistorius has claimed that Oliveira's extended prostheses gave him longer stride lengths and helped him record \"ridiculous\" times \u2013 and beat the South African in the 200m. According to <a href=\"http://www.sportsscientists.com/2012/09/oscar-pistorius-counting-strides-as.html\" title=\"\">one blogger's count</a>, however, Pistorius took 92 steps in the race to Oliveira's 98 steps. Of course, Oliveira's stride may well now be longer than it was before he extended his Ossur running feet but his victory was not built on a longer stride length than Pistorius's.</p> <h2>Do longer prostheses make athletes quicker?</h2> <p>They can, by increasingly the stride length, but it is not as simple as that. Shorter prosthetics can, in theory, also give a runner an advantage over longer-limbed rivals: making him or her quicker out of the blocks at the start. The IPC agrees that more research is needed on the impact of different protheses over the duration of a race and has already agreed to meet Pistorius and discuss his concerns. Its formula for prothesis length may well be changed before Oliveira can defend his 200m title in his home country in 2016. The battle over the blades is far from over.</p>",

We are not asking people in the ESA Wrag to do anything different but we have proposed changes to the regulations as we move towards universal credit. The regulations are still to be discussed in the House [of Commons].\"</p> <p>As the measure would go through parliament as a statutory instrument, it would normally be expected to be approved without a vote.</p> <p>Charities have warned that stripping Wrag claimants of 70% of their allowance risked \"devastating\" consequences for people's health, especially since a good number of those currently being sanctioned have little understanding of why they are being punished.</p> <p>The draft letter warns: \"From 3 December 2012, the law is changing and you could lose more money, for a longer period of time, if you do not:</p> <p>\u2022 Attend and take part in work-focused interviews, without a good reason.</p> <p>\u2022 Carry out work-related activities that your adviser asks you to do, without a good reason.\"</p> <p>Under a heading titled: What is the change?, the two-page letter goes on to explain that there will be increased penalties and punishments for those \"who do not take the actions requested by the adviser\".</p> <p>The letter says: \"Employment and Support Allowance payments could be reduced by \u00a371 a week until you take the required actions. After that your payments will also be reduced for an additional one, two or four weeks. The number of weeks will depend on whether you have had your benefit reduced in the previous 52 weeks.\"</p> <p>The plan to increase the penalty for the sick and disabled follows earlier revelations that the government wants to bring in unpaid and unlimited work experience placements for those in ESA Wrag group.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/feb/17/disabled-unpaid-work-benefit-cuts-documents\" title=\"\">DWP PowerPoint presentation to charities</a> late last year explained that unpaid work experience without any statutory time limit would be a \"supportive measure\" where suitable to \"personal circumstances\".</p> <p>Following that meeting, the government passed <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/5/section/55/enacted\" title=\"\">clause 55 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012</a> to legally permit officials to make the sick and disabled in the Wrag group do work experience as a condition of their benefit claim.</p> <p>The DWP has now told the Guardian the department has yet to finalise plans on unpaid work experience for the sick and disabled but did not rule out their introduction by 3 December.</p> <p>Paul Farmer, chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, warned that the increased sanctions could devastate people's mental health.</p> <p>\"It is important to remember that people in the work-related activity group have been assessed as unfit for work \u2013 they are not at full health and are still very vulnerable,\" he said. \"They face significant barriers to return to employment and need support rather than the threat of sanction.</p> <p>\"Whatever an individual's health problems, slashing their benefit is only going to exacerbate the strain they are already under. The additional stress and anxiety incurred by the sanction \u2013 worries about paying for bills, rent and even food \u2013 risks devastating their mental health.\"</p> <p>He added that advisers did not have \"enough mental health expertise\" to understand the complexities of mental health issues and that if introduced, unpaid work experience backed up with the threat of sanctions would also \"risk damaging people's mental health\" and push them even further away from the workplace.</p> <p>Gillian Guy, the Citizens Advice chief executive, said lots of cases had already cropped up where benefit sanctions were applied \"inappropriately, often causing great hardship\".</p> <p>\"People have their benefits cut with little or no warning or explanation or understanding of what they failed to do.</p> <p>\"If people who are judged to be too ill or disabled to work are to face having all their benefit stopped for failing to stick to their agreement, it's essential that it's absolutely clear what has been agreed, and that&#xa0;this is reasonable given their health condition or disability,\" she said.</p> <p>\"With much harsher sanctions&#xa0;being brought in&#xa0;it's urgent that the government&#xa0;starts monitoring how sanctions are used and the impact on claimants and their families,\" she added.</p>",
  "<p>The Leveson inquiry into press standards helped drive the number of defamation cases against British newspapers and broadcasters to a five-year low in the 12 months to May 2012, according to a leading legal publisher.</p> <p>Research by Sweet &amp; Maxwell showed a 36% year-on-year drop in the number of reported defamation cases against newspapers and broadcasters to 27: a trend they partly attributed to a more cautious approach by editors during Lord Justice Leveson's public inquiry into the ethics and practices of the media.</p> <p>\"Public scrutiny following the eruption of the phone-hacking scandal is leading to a lower appetite for risk for some media outlets,\" said Korieh Duodu, a partner at specialist media law firm David Price Solicitors and Advocates. The number of reported defamation cases against all publishers, including online blogs and websites, fell 15%, year on year, to 71 in the year to May.</p> <p>Sweet &amp; Maxwell said that the number of defamation cases involving celebrities was down to seven this year, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/12/morrissey-receive-apology-from-nme\" title=\"\">Morrissey's settled action against NME</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/25/charlotte-church-people-libel-payout\" title=\"\">Charlotte Church's payout from the People</a>. The Thomson Reuters-owned publisher said that the fall in defamation cases is also partly down to a change in tactics by prominent figures, who have used privacy injunctions to prevent potentially damaging stories seeing the light of day.</p> <p>\"The use of privacy law by celebrities and other high-profile individuals has certainly increased over the last few years, with individuals using these new legal threats to try and stamp out negative stories before they arise,\" Duodu added.</p> <p>In December last year, Sweet &amp; Maxwell reported that there had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/dec/05/privacy-press-intrusion\" title=\"\">50 privacy cases launched in the 12 months to May 2011, compared with 43 in the same period the previous year</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>When I told people in New York I was moving to Chicago last year, they generally spent the first five minutes telling me how lucky I was. They emoted about \"the lake\" \u2013 Lake Michigan \u2013 which marks the city's eastern boundary; the eclectic skyline; the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture; the affable locals; the jazz scene; and the vibrant, self-sufficient neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Then they'd spend the next 10 minutes explaining why they would not be coming to visit me for seven months of the year. They'd recall their wasted hours at Chicago O'Hare airport, where they missed their connection because of bad weather, and threaten you with winds so chill they'd freeze you from the inside out.</p> <p>But the year I have been here has not been typical. It's been unseasonably warm throughout most of the past year, and I have seen shirtsleeves in October and sandals in April. But the clement weather has brought its own problems. Because when the sun is shining, people go out. And when people go out in Chicago, it transpires, they are more likely to get shot. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/us/rate-of-killings-rises-38-percent-in-chicago-in-12.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">murder rate</a> for the first half of the year was up 38% on last year \u2013 which was not a great year \u2013 meaning that, by June, fewer US forces were killed in Kabul than <a href=\"http://uptownmagazine.com/2012/06/chicago-homicide-rate-worse-than-kabul-la-and-nyc/\" title=\"\">murdered here</a>. Over May's Memorial Day weekend alone there were 43 shootings and 10 murders.</p> <p>\"Chicago is a different beast when it comes down to the issue of violence,\" <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/29/nation/la-na-nn-bloody-chicago-weekend-20120529\" title=\"\">Tio Hardiman</a>, director of <a href=\"http://ceasefirechicago.org/\" title=\"\">CeaseFire Illinois</a>, a violence prevention group, told Frontline. \"You have outbreaks of violence the same way you have outbreaks of diseases in countries throughout the world. Some people are going to sleep in Chicago thinking about who they're going to shoot the next day.\" At a meeting on traffic awareness at my son's day-care centre, one of&#xa0;the parents asked whether school outings would still pass the site of a recent shooting.</p> <p>\"We must talk to the children about how to handle situations like that,\" said the principal. \"Because the big problem in those situations is that they panic.\"</p> <p>Panic in the presence of gunfire in broad daylight, I thought, was a perfectly rational response. The problem wasn't the panic but the shooting. On the way home I saw posters on the window of the youth club at the top of our street saying: \"Stop Killing People.\" It seems like the kind of suggestion you wouldn't need a poster for.</p> <p>Every major US city has, at some time, gained a particular reputation for dysfunctionality, usually related to crime, violence, corruption or insolvency (and occasionally all four). But Chicago is not any city. It's Obamatown. Pictures of the president are everywhere \u2013 barbershops, diners, nail salons and bodegas. He smiles down from the foyer of the college that houses the day-care centre only to peer out again amid the stick-men pictures and spidery penmanship on the wall of centre itself.&#xa0;</p> <p>Whenever the first family come back for a break or a family event, traffic jams with pride. Not long ago, I saw a bumper sticker in my neighbourhood \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/crossn81/4516948800/\" title=\"\">Oromos for Obama</a> \u2013 expressing support from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group: now that's micro-marketing.</p> <p>Obama, needless to say, is not responsible for this mayhem. True, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rahm-emanuel\" title=\"\">current mayor</a>, Rahm Emanuel, was his first chief of staff. (His second was William Daley, son of one former Chicago mayor and brother to another.) But Emanuel has been in for little more than a year and Obama only served three terms as a state senator in the city \u2013 when the murder rate was much lower \u2013 before doing four years as senator for Illinois. Nonetheless, of all the places where this shape-shifting president has lived \u2013 Hawaii, Indonesia, New York, Boston \u2013 this is the place he is most closely identified with (unless you are one of those stubborn Republicans who still believes he is really from Kenya). It's where his campaign headquarters are and where, on that unusually warm November night four years ago, he strolled out on to a stage in Grant Park to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/06/uselections2008-usa\" title=\"\">claim his place in history</a>.</p> <p>As the first president for several decades to be associated with a big city,&#xa0;he is particularly vulnerable. For regardless of how many <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/169083/aurora-another-mass-killing-shocks-america-why\" title=\"\">mass slayings</a> may occur in suburbs and how much crystal meth may be distributed in rural areas, cities remain the principal repository for the nation's anxieties. All the national woes are evident here. The abandoned shoes outside the door&#xa0;across the hallway from my son's friend's apartment are testament to a housing market only now bouncing back. The queues at the local food banks keep growing. The <a href=\" http://www.idph.state.il.us/health/infant/infmortrace.htm\" title=\"\">mortality rate</a> for black infants is on a par with the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html\" title=\"\">West Bank</a>.</p> <p>It is widely believed that it was to avoid scenes of rioting in his home town that Obama abruptly moved the G8 summit from Chicago to Camp David. It's also thought to be the reason that Emanuel now seems keen to compromise in the face of an impending teachers' strike that is due to start next week (that and the fact that the overwhelming majority of the city support the teachers).</p> <p>And so it is with Chicago that Obama is tarred by opponents, who have come to refer to the city not as the third-largest in the country but as an <a href=\" http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-chicago-politics-20120722,0,3228644.story\" title=\"\">epithet</a>. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney described Obama's attacks on his record as a venture capitalist at the private equity firm Bain Capital as \"Chicago politics at its worst\". Former Bush <em>consigili\u00e8re</em> Karl Rove, who knows a thing or two about political smears, called the attacks the \"gutter politics of&#xa0;the worst Chicago sort\". Romney surrogate John Sununu, who recently insisted Obama should \"learn how to be an American\", previously said: \"Can you imagine coming out of Chicago politics, where 'politician' and 'felon' are synonymous? You've got two governors in prison today.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395628515\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/3/1346686403281/A-Chicagoan-campaigns-aga-010.jpg\" alt=\"A Chicagoan campaigns against shootings in the city\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young Chicagoan campaigns against the wave of shootings that is blighting her city. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not quite true. One of those imprisoned Illinois governors, Republican George Ryan, was not from Chicago. And while Obama lived in the city and practised politics there, he was hardly a product of its political culture \u2013 indeed, as a community organiser he was most often trying to confront it from the outside.</p> <p>The attacks also seem to be aimed at Chicago's past rather than its present. The Republicans aren't slating the city for its gun crime (they are against gun control) or the teachers' dispute (they loathe teachers' unions) but the place the city occupies in the national imagination, where crime and politics are ostensibly deeply intertwined.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"When their ideas of today's middle class are rooted in the JR Ewing family on the remake of Dallas,\" said Emanuel, \"it's no surprise their idea of Chicago politics comes from watching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(TV_series)\" title=\"\">Boss</a>. They need a reality check on both fronts.\"</p> <p>This is not quite true either. The city's history of machine politics, where patronage was far more important than policies or ideology, does stretch back a long way. In 1948, <a href=\"http://www.mikvachallenge.org/the-mikvas/\" title=\"\">Abner Mikva</a>, originally from Milwaukee, famously went to the local Democratic party to try to sign up to help campaign for Adlai Stevenson for governor and Paul Douglas for Senate. The local committeeman asked him: \"Who sent you?\"</p> <p>\"Nobody sent me,\" said Mikva. \"I just want to help.\"</p> <p>\"We don't want nobody that nobody sent,\" said the committeeman and sent Mikva away.</p> <p>But the legacy of those years still lingers. A <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21548264\" title=\"\">report</a> earlier this year by Dick Simpson from the University of Illinois at Chicago, revealed that Chicago boasts the most convictions since 1976 in the country. Since then, more than 1,500 elected officials, appointees, government employees and some private individuals have been convicted of corruption in Illinois' Northern District \u2013 the judicial zone that includes the Chicago metropolitan area.</p> <p>Politics here is about as raw as it gets in the west. Rod Blagojevich, a fomer Illinois governor and a Chicago native, <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/dec/07/rod-blagojevich-illinois-corrupt\" title=\"\">was caught on tape</a> trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by Obama when he won the presidency. \"I've got this thing and it's fucking golden, and I'm just not giving it up for fucking nothing. I'm not gonna do it.\" For this Blagojevich got 14 years in prison, the fourth of the last eight governors to end up behind bars in the past 50 years.</p> <p>The notoriously profane Emanuel (nicknamed Rahmbo) once mailed a dead fish to a pollster whom he accused of costing his candidate an election. When he was inaugurated, he said: \"I&#xa0;am not a patient man. I will not be a&#xa0;patient mayor.\"</p> <p>For most of the postwar period, Chicago politics was also a family affair. For 43 of the last 56 years before Emanuel took over the city was run by just two men, father and son, with the same name \u2013 Richard Daley. The father and, to a much lesser extent, the son doled out jobs and released funds to those who did their bidding and punished those who did not. </p> <p>In 2005, <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/aug/13/usa.garyyounge\" title=\"\">a&#xa0;judicial inquiry</a> found the city council had been granting jobs to people who were ostensibly interviewed while dead or serving in Iraq. The fact that, a year later, Daley Jr was re-elected with a whopping 72% tells you something about how many Chicagoans view these matters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395628516\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/3/1346686132918/Man-in-Obama-Eats-Here-T--010.jpg\" alt=\"Man in \"Obama Eats Here\" T-shirt\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man wearing a restaurant T-shirt that proclaims the city's pride in the president.

Corruption by itself will not cause a mayor in Chicago to be defeated. It has to be coupled with other issues, such as poor services or high tax increases.\"</p> <p>It is this attitude that makes Chicago such an endearing city to me despite all&#xa0;the obvious flaws. Its citizens display a remarkable ability to convert its insecurities into a positive local identity. As corrupt as the Daleys may have been there was never any suggestion that they were in it to line their own pockets or that they weren't generally driven by their passion for the city. Mayors are more likely to be fired here for not clearing the snow than interviewing dead people because Chicagoans appreciate leaders who get things done and can deliver. That doesn't make the corruption excusable. But it explains why it's not definitive.</p> <p>There is a healthy disdain for the self-referential arrogance of the coasts. When people talk about midwestern hicks or the flyover states, Chicagoans, not unreasonably, feel they are also disparaged. \"A lot of Chicagoans are sensitive to the accusation that their city is too provincial,\" explains Mike Dumke, an investigative reporter for the Chicago Reader. \"We're the third-largest city in the country by size. But&#xa0;they fear we're a distant third in influence.\" But unlike many New Yorkers, they love their city in its own right, not because they think it's better than anywhere else.</p> <p>And there is a general sense that City Hall is cleaning up its act. When I&#xa0;was visiting schools recently, most principals emphasised that all attempts to buck the system are futile. \"I couldn't even get my daughter into this&#xa0;school. There's no such thing as the&#xa0;'Chicago Way' any more,\" said one, using the shorthand for the kind of corruption particular to the city.</p> <p>None of this compensates for the sense of insecurity when a shooting takes place at the top of your block \u2013 as it did recently \u2013 or when your five-year-old asks to cycle a different way to school because \"people over there keep getting arrested\".</p> <p>But it makes it liveable. Because all the things New Yorkers referred to in their first five minutes are still true. Cycle alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Shore_Drive\" title=\"\">Lake Shore Drive</a> in the early morning and you will pass black church groups jogging, Asians playing cricket and the tinkling of masts in the&#xa0;marina. All this with the lake lapping at your feet and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock_Center\">John Hancock Centre</a> looming ahead. Whether I will feel quite the same next winter is another matter.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012 to make clear that the Chicago teachers' strike is scheduled to start next week, not on the first day of the Democratic national convention. The original also referred to the John Hancock Tower, which is in Boston, rather than John Hancock Centre.</p>",
  "<p>For years it seems impregnable, then suddenly the citadel collapses. An ideology, a fact, a regime appears fixed, unshakeable, almost geological. Then an inch of mortar falls, and the stonework begins to slide. Something of this kind happened over the weekend.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/tony-blair-iraq-war-desmond-tutu?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Desmond Tutu wrote that Tony Blair should be treading the path to The Hague</a>, he de-normalised what Blair has done. Tutu broke the protocol of power \u2013 the implicit accord between those who flit from one grand meeting to another \u2013 and named his crime. I expect that Blair will never recover from it.</p> <p>The offence is known by two names in international law: the <a href=\"http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=aggression\" title=\"\">crime of aggression</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/crimes-against-peace/\" title=\"\">crime against peace</a>. It is defined by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles\" title=\"\">Nuremberg principles</a> as the \"planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression\". This means a war fought for a purpose other than self-defence: in other words outwith articles 33 and 51 of the UN Charter.</p> <p>That the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/iraq-war-inquiry\" title=\"\">invasion of Iraq falls into this category looks indisputable</a>. Blair's cabinet ministers knew it, and told him so. His attorney general warned that there were just three ways in which it could be legally justified: \"self-defence, humanitarian intervention, or UN security council authorisation. The first and second could not be the base in this case.\" Blair tried and failed to obtain the third.</p> <p>His foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told Blair that for the war to be legal, \"i) there must be an armed attack upon a state or such an attack must be imminent; ii) the use of force must be necessary and other means to reverse/avert the attack must be unavailable; iii) the acts in self-defence must be proportionate and strictly confined to the object of stopping the attack.\" None of these conditions were met. The Cabinet Office told him: \"A legal justification for invasion would be needed. Subject to law officers' advice, none currently exists.\"</p> <p>Without legal justification, the attack on Iraq was an act of mass murder. It caused the deaths of between 100,000 and a million people, and ranks among the greatest crimes the world has ever seen. That Blair and his ministers still saunter among us, gathering money wherever they go, is a withering indictment of a one-sided system of international justice: a system whose hypocrisies Tutu has exposed.</p> <p>Blair's diminishing band of apologists cling to two desperate justifications. The&#xa0;first is that the war was automatically authorised by a prior <a href=\"http://www.un.org/Docs/scres/2002/sc2002.htm\" title=\"\">UN resolution</a>, 1441. But when it was discussed in the security council, both the American and British ambassadors insisted that 1441 did not authorise the use of force. The UK representative stated that \"there is no 'automaticity' in this resolution. If there is a further Iraqi breach of its disarmament obligations, the matter will return to the council for discussion as required in paragraph 12.\" Two months later, in January 2003, the attorney general reminded Blair that \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1441\" title=\"\">resolution 1441 does not authorise the use of military force without a further determination by the security council</a>\".</p> <p>Yet when Blair ran out of options, he&#xa0;and his lieutenants began arguing that 1441 authorised their war. They are&#xa0;still at it: on Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19454562\" title=\"\">Lord Falconer tried it out on Radio </a>4. Perhaps he had&#xa0;forgotten that it has been thoroughly discredited.</p> <p>The second justification, attempted again by Blair this weekend, is that there&#xa0;was a moral case for invading Iraq.&#xa0;Yes, there was one. There was also&#xa0;a moral case for not invading Iraq, and this case was stronger.</p> <p>But a moral case (and who has launched an aggressive war in modern times without claiming to possess one?) does not provide a legal basis. Nor was it the motivation for the attack. In September 2000, before they took office, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century\" title=\"\">project run by future members of the Bush administration</a> \u2013 including Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz \u2013 produced a report which said the following: \"While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.\" Their purpose, they revealed, was \"maintaining American military pre-eminence\". The motivation for deposing Saddam Hussein was no more moral than the motivation for arming and funding him, two decades before.</p> <p>But while the case against Blair is strong, the means are weak. Twenty-nine people have been indicted in the international criminal court, and all of them are African. (Suspects in the Balkans have been indicted by a different tribunal). There's a reason for this. Until 2018 at the earliest, the court can prosecute crimes committed during the course of an illegal war, but not the crime of launching that war.</p> <p>Should we be surprised? Though the Nuremberg tribunal described aggression as \"the supreme international crime\", several powerful states guiltily resisted its adoption. At length, in 2010, they agreed that the court would have jurisdiction over aggression, but not until 2018 or thereafter. Though the offence has been recognised in international law for 67 years, the international criminal court (unlike the Rwanda and Yugoslavia tribunals, which hear cases from before they were established) will be able to try only crimes of aggression committed beyond that date.</p> <p>The other possibility is&#xa0;a&#xa0;prosecution in one&#xa0;of the states (there are at least 25) which have incorporated the crime of aggression into their&#xa0;own laws. Perhaps Blair's&#xa0;lawyers are now working through the list and cancelling a few speaking gigs.</p> <p>That the prospect of prosecution currently looks remote makes it all the more important that the crime is not forgotten. To this end, in 2010 I set up a&#xa0;bounty fund \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.arrestblair.org/\" title=\"\">www.arrestblair.org</a> \u2013 to&#xa0;promote peaceful citizens' arrests of&#xa0;the former prime minister. People contribute to the fund, a quarter of which is paid out to anyone who makes an attempt which meets the rules. With our fourth payment last week, we've now disbursed more than \u00a310,000. Our&#xa0;aim is the same as Tutu's: to de-normalise an act of mass murder, to keep it in the public mind and to maintain the pressure for a prosecution.</p> <p>That looked, until this weekend, like&#xa0;an almost impossible prospect. But when the masonry begins to crack, impossible hopes can become first plausible, then inexorable. Blair will now find himself shut out of places where he was once welcome. One day he may find himself shut in.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p> <p><em>A fully referenced version of this article is available at </em><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\"><em>www.monbiot.com</em></a></p>",

Three months from now, the young Syrian mother will give birth again, this time in circumstances that are less life-threatening but characterised by destitution, misery and choking swirls of sand in a relentless wind.</p> <p>Home for Abu Zaid, 29, her husband and their four young children \u2013 and thousands of other refugees from the violence in Syria \u2013 is now a desert tent city in northern Jordan. Days are dominated by a wearying and unwinnable battle to keep the sand at bay and the fear of losing a child among the near-identical rows of flapping tents and thousands of displaced youngsters.</p> <p>But at least the Abu Zaids have escaped the horrors of Dael, north of Deraa. They left the town around six weeks ago, part of a stream of people fleeing across the border to Jordan. In the past week or two, that stream has become a river of desperate humanity: mainly women and children, moving under the cover of darkness, clutching only their fear, each other's hands and the odd plastic bag of possessions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395595099\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/3/1346688946261/Syrian-refugees-001.png\" alt=\"Syrian refugees\" width=\"460\" height=\"455\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian refugees Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zataari refugee camp, opened by the Jordanian government at the end of July to house 500 people, has swollen to a population of more than 26,000. Two-thirds of them are children, of whom around 5,000 are under the age of four. Five hundred are \"unaccompanied minors\" \u2013 youngsters who made the perilous journey without their parents, and who are now dealing with the pain of separation along with new privations and the traumas they left behind.</p> <p>Official expectations are that Jordan's refugee population will grow by up to 10,000 a week. The Jordanian government says there are a further 140,000 Syrian refugees crammed into towns and villages close to the border. Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq have also seen huge influxes of refugees, with thousands more still trying to leave Syria.</p> <p>At Zataari, conditions are wretched despite sterling efforts by humanitarian organisations. Sand and dust whipped up by the wind sweeping across the nine-square-kilometre site cause respiratory problems. Newly erected tents are swiftly coated in a layer of sand, turning their colour from white to brown within a day or two. Sand is in children's hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, under fingernails; eyes are rimmed red; voices hoarse.</p> <p>Only 40% of the camp has electricity. There is one latrine per 50 refugees. For now, the desert sun beats down on the exposed ground for 12 hours a day, but within weeks night temperatures will plummet and winter will bring driving rain and freezing winds.</p> <p>The Jordanian army maintains a heavy presence inside and outside the camp. Refugees are not allowed to leave without special permits. Less than two weeks ago, a protest by camp inmates over conditions and frustration at the tight security was quelled by teargas fired by soldiers.</p> <p>Bulldozers, earth movers, water tankers, delivery and garbage trucks rumble continuously through the camp's entrance, a serious hazard to hundreds of people milling around aimlessly. The United Nations agency for refugees, UNHCR, acknowledges the camp's problems but insists the priority is to get infrastructure in place for the existing population and the refugees expected in the coming days and weeks.</p> <p>The high proportion of children in the camp presents particular challenges. \"Many children coming across [the border] are traumatised and some are injured,\" says Pip Leighton of the UN children's agency, Unicef. \"There is huge psychological stress. Many of them have seen things that no adult should see, let alone a child.\"</p> <p>Agencies such as Unicef and Save the Children are offering specialist counselling and therapeutic activities. \"These kids are telling stories that are pretty frightening,\" says Hedinn Halldorsson of Save the Children. \"Some have been in hiding for months. Many are waking in the night, crying. Some children are panicking when they hear the planes [from a nearby Jordanian military base] overhead.\"</p> <p>In many cases, fathers have stayed behind in Syria in the hope of protecting property and caring for livestock. \"Separation is traumatic,\" says Halldorsson.</p> <p>Humanitarian agencies have set up designated play areas, and are working on establishing schools within the camp. \"But some days we do nothing but help parents search for lost children,\" says Rae McGrath of Save the Children.</p> <p>Abu Zaid says that, whatever the problems of the camp, it is better than what the family left behind. \"I was very afraid \u2013 the shelling was all around us. All the time the children were terrified and not sleeping,\" she says. \"This is not how we are used to living. We're adjusting. But the children have started playing again. At home, they were locked inside the house.\"</p> <p>Miriam, 11, who has been at Zataari for two weeks after fleeing from Sawara with her mother and five siblings, says she has no idea how long the family will stay. Her father stayed behind to take care of the family's cows. \"I'm worried about him,\" she says.</p> <p>Abed, 12, from Deraa, was smuggled through the mountains at night with his mother, three brothers and four sisters. \"I was scared,\" he says, but adds: \"Here we feel safe.\"</p> <p>Most of the refugees cross the border east of the official \u2013 but now closed \u2013 crossing at the town of Ramtha. The nightly numbers hit a peak of 3,300 last week; a subsequent drop is attributed to the period of a full moon.</p> <p>Most of the women and children are smuggled under the protection of rebels; some men bring their families and then return to Syria. The refugees are brought in buses to the camp, usually arriving while it is still dark. After registration and a meal, families wait to be allocated a tent.</p> <p>\"We're all just about keeping ahead of the problem,\" says Leighton. \"But if there was a massive influx, we would have significant challenges.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Daily Telegraph has successfully defended a libel claim over an article about the Duchess of Cambridge's hair, which was heard by an independent arbitrator rather than a high court judge.</p> <p>The Telegraph was threatened with a libel action by the owner of the London-based hairdressing salon Richard Ward Hair &amp; Metrospa over an article published on 4 July headlined: \"Is it scissors at dawn for the royal crimpers?\"</p> <p>The article carried an interview with James Pryce, the stylist behind Kate Middleton's hair for the royal wedding, who left the hairdressing salon in acrimonious circumstances last year.</p> <p>Richard Ward complained that the article portrayed Pryce as having exclusively designed Middleton's hair for the big day when, in fact, nine others had been involved. He also said the article libelled his salon as vindictive employers who had \"stitched shut\" Pryce's lips to prevent him talking about his celebrity clients. However, the independent arbitration scheme found that the article was not defamatory.</p> <p>The libel case broke new legal ground because it was tried before two lay assessors and the experienced media lawyer, Desmond Browne QC, rather than the high court in London. The Telegraph and Ward agreed to settle the dispute through Early Resolution, a scheme set up by the former Times lawyer Alastair Brett as an alternative to costly high court hearings.</p> <p>David Price QC, who acted for the Daily Telegraph, said the case took little more than a month to resolve, without witnesses giving oral evidence.</p> <p>\"Any way of quickly deciding whether something is defamatory or not before it gets to court has to be commended,\" he said of the scheme.</p> <p>Legal experts said the new scheme was a more cost-effective avenue for newspaper groups, compared with the fees involved in high court disputes. The scheme is understood to have cost the Daily Telegraph around \u00a34,000 to use, not including legal fees.</p> <p>The claim was tried through writing only, with the assessors and Browne judging the case on written submissions rather than oral representations from lawyers. Lord Justice Leveson has repeatedly expressed his interest in an early resolution scheme during his inquiry into press standards.</p> <p>David Banks, the media law expert and co-author of McNae's Essential Law for Journalists, said: \"It's a way forward, which I assume many newspapers would be very much in favour of because it reduces the withering costs of libel actions. Claimants would also want a speedy settlement, they don't want issues dragged through the courts, and so one would hope this is a road both sides can carry on down.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 September 2012 to reflect the fact that Richard Ward did not sue the Daily Telegraph for libel before going through independent arbitration.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

This fact, we're told, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/12/christmas-congo-electronic-companies\" title=\"\">ties US consumers directly to villagers</a> in the volatile, resource-rich eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</p> <p>Our insatiable demand for electronic devices is keeping brutal militia groups in business, goes the now familiar story, and cleaning up the mineral trade is the key to peace. This narrative, simple yet deeply controversial, has provided fodder for newspaper columns and galvanised campus and consumer groups across the US to demand \"conflict-free\" gadgets. Long-ignored by Washington, it has helped push eastern Congo centre stage.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/conflict-minerals-supply-chain-legislation\" title=\"\">July 2010, a provision</a> (<a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/speccorpdisclosure.shtml\" title=\"\">section 1502</a>) was added to the gargantuan <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2Fabout%2Flaws%2Fwallstreetreform-cpa.pdf&amp;ei=2ZFEUIqpJITT0QWytYBI&amp;usg=AFQjCNGj12VcoYHuakKquosc4ObHaJE_bw\" title=\"\">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a>, requiring US-listed companies to investigate and disclose whether the tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold used in their products comes from the DRC or a neighbouring country. But now that the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/\" title=\"\">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has finally released long-overdue rules to implement what is known in eastern Congo as \"Obama's law\", the story seems anything but simple.</p> <p>Analysts and observers are still poring over the SEC's 356-page <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf\" title=\"\">\"conflict minerals\" rule</a>, and comments continue to trickle out. But don't expect much celebration. Industry groups will continue to groan about the cost and difficulty of conducting detailed investigations of their complex supply-chains. Others have questioned whether it's appropriate to task the US capital markets regulator with humanitarian and foreign policy concerns.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.enoughproject.org/news/sec-adopts-conflict-minerals-rules-chamber-threatens-lawsuit\" title=\"\">Enough Project</a> and <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/\" title=\"\">Global Witness</a>, NGOs that led the charge for \"conflict minerals\" legislation, have issued relatively cheerless reactions. Both take issue, for example, with the SEC's decision to allow companies to describe the origin of their products as \"undeterminable\" for two to four years, depending on the company's size. Proponents of this \"phase-in\" period say it's necessary, given the time and effort required to mount such complex inquiries. Advocates say it's unacceptable, given immediate needs.</p> <p>Much seems to hinge on the definition of \"manufacturing\", and on the judgment of SEC regulators as to who and what is covered by the rules. So far, mining companies and some major retailers that simply affix their brands to third-party manufactured goods appear exempt.</p> <p>The contrast between the emotive campaigning around \"conflict minerals\" and the unglamorous work ahead is stark: the SEC's rules are only about disclosure. How much capacity will the agency have to review these reports? How involved will campaigners get in the important but tedious task of monitoring disclosures? This is complex stuff, demanding far more than signing a petition or calling a senator.</p> <p>Still, few seem to doubt the Dodd-Frank regulations will have an impact on the profits armed groups extract from the mineral trade. But will it end the violence, as promised?</p> <p>Critics argue that the focus on cleaning up the mineral trade \u2013 in itself, a noble aim \u2013 has simplified a complex conflict. In <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1425843/\" title=\"\">a paper published by the Centre for Global Development</a> earlier this year, Laura Seay, professor of political science at Morehouse College in Atlanta, argued there is no reason to believe that armed groups won't just find other sources of revenue. The idea that they fight because of minerals, or the money they make selling them, is historically inaccurate, she says. Instead, Seay offers a series of reports that suggest Section 1502 has already put entire Congolese communities out of work as companies look for minerals elsewhere.</p> <p>If the \"conflict minerals\" story has put eastern Congo on the international agenda, it has done so at a significant cost, <a href=\"http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/111/443/202.full\" title=\"\">argues Columbia University professor S\u00e9verine Autesserre</a>. In exchange for attention, Autesserre says the issue has diverted attention from other key issues: poverty, corruption, land conflicts, the reform of local institutions. It has hindered the search for a comprehensive solution, she argues, leaving us instead with a series of poorly conceived technical responses.</p> <p>There's little doubt that those who led the charge for \"conflict minerals\" legislation understood the complexities of the conflict in eastern Congo and few would argue that foreign firms should, however indirectly, continue to bankroll \u2013 and profit from \u2013 the activities of militia groups. But was it right to simplify the message and use stories of rape and sexual abuse to push it through?</p>",
  "<p>Several of you took me to task for suggesting last month (in passing in a note about the West Midlands origins of balti cooking) that the ubiquitous Chinese dish 'chow mein' was invented in the United States. Surely, I was told, the dish I was after was chop suey, not chow mein. For example, Rob W. insisted that chow mein was an authentic Chinese menu item, since the words mean 'fried noodles' in both Mandarin and Cantonese. With respect, as we say, that argument is a non sequitur. For <em>balti</em> is a word found in both Urdu and Hindi, meaning a pail or bucket, but that is not evidence that balti cooking was first practised in the Indian subcontinent, because it wasn't. </p> <p>I would not for a moment deny that the Chinese-style dish of meat or chicken, stewed with bean sprouts and other delicious things, that we all know as chop suey originated in the United States and I would never dream of using the argument that chop suey means 'mixed bits' in Cantonese to suggest the contrary. But chow mein is defined by no less an authority than Collins as 'a Chinese-American dish'; Chambers has it as 'a Chinese-style dish, served with fried noodles; and the Oxford Dictionary of English has it both as 'a Chinese-style dish' and dates its invention to the late 19th century. Taken together this seems to suggest that chow mein was not traditionally eaten down the centuries by either Mandarin or Cantonese speakers on the Chinese mainland. Its origins would seem to have been in post-gold rush San Fransisco's Chinatown. But I should be delighted to be contradicted by anyone who actually knows about the subject.</p> <p>It raises, though, a question about how many ethnically-styled, now globalised dishes did not in fact originate in the area with which they are associated. The thin pizzas of Pizza Express presumably owe more to Italian immigrants in the United States than they do to Italy itself. And I am reliably informed that 'spaghetti with meat balls' was an invention some time around 1955 at the original Spaghetti House in Goodge Street, London W1. If there were enough other examples of this gastronomic genre, perhaps at some point I could persuade one of our setters to construct a puzzle around the theme. </p> <p>_____<br>A correspondent tells me that, over the years, he and his mother have submitted quite a number of completely correct Saturday prize puzzles, but have yet to win a prize. He wonders whether there are some undeclared rules that govern winning entries. For example, does the solution have to be filled in very neatly, or in capital letters only, or with no scribblings in the margins? The answer is that there are no such undeclared rules and that, provided the solutions are entered legibly (it matters not whether that be in ink or pencil), each correct entry should have the same random chance of winning. The process is simple. All the entries (by post and by fax) go to the same mailing house in Birmingham. The staff there select randomly a small sample, which is sent to the Guardian's offices in London on Friday afternoon. There the entries are checked to weed out any that contain errors and the first five (or the first 10 with Araucaria's bank holiday specials) are declared as that week's winners. _____<br>From time to time I get cries for help from solvers who cannot get a puzzle on the website to print on A4 paper.

  "<p>This weekend <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/criminalising-squatting-poor-rich\">a new law</a> came into force that makes squatting \u2013 the occupation of empty buildings by otherwise homeless people \u2013 a criminal offence. Previously a lesser civil offence, the new law confronts squatters with the possibility of a \u00a35,000 fine or six months in prison, with ministers declaring that this will shut the door once and for all on squatters while helping protect \"hard-working home-owners\".</p> <p>Some newspapers might periodically report on groups of squatters who have (often very temporarily) moved into a plush mansion in one of London's richer districts. The mundane reality, though, is that squatted buildings are more often than not council properties that have been neglected \u2013 less desirable places in less desirable areas. What ministers have overlooked in their research is that squatting is born out of necessity. It is about individuals or small localised collectives assuming the management and maintenance of assets within their neighbourhood. It is \u2013 dare I say \u2013 an expression of the \"big society\".</p> <p>The other overlooked fact is that squat culture is the great unspoken patron of the arts in Britain. Seeing and hearing references to the Clash and the Sex Pistols during the Olympics ceremonies was a reminder that illegal squatting enabled these bands to exist in the first place \u2013 as it did with more recent bands like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/17/return-of-levellers\">the Levellers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/jul/30/libertines.popandrock\">the Libertines</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/apr/06/the-king-blues-g20-protests\">the King Blues</a>, all of whom regularly threw gigs in their new homes.</p> <p>But squatting is more than just punks climbing through back windows. There is a long and rich tradition of squatting in Britain, especially in London, a city with a shortage of accommodation and extremely high rental and property prices. Whether driven by political commitment or financial necessity, squatting has permeated pop culture at all levels. Richard Branson once squatted a building, though it's not something he likes to talk about. Bob Geldof, too, lived in a squat and busked his way around London. No squatting, no multimillion-pound famine relief a decade later? Who could say.</p> <p>Less obviously anarchic representatives of the rock establishment including Eric Clapton, Sting, Mark Knopfler, Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox were all resourceful enough to put a roof over their heads when the situation demanded it.</p> <p>Boy George famously squatted in a five-storey Edwardian residence on London's Great Titchfield Street in the late 70s and early 80s and still managed to look fabulous even without access to running water or a working toilet. Posters of Bowie and strategically hung Chinese umbrellas covered up the damp patches. Throw Seal, the Shamen, Depeche Mode, My Bloody Valentine and Stereolab into the mix and it's obvious that squatting and creative industries go hand in hand. </p> <p>I have some experience of squatting. As a 21-year-old graduate, I secured a job at the now-defunct Melody Maker. I had nowhere to live, no benefits and no money to pay rent. So I moved into a squat called <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/for-the-oldest-squatters-in-town-eviction-is-just-not-cricket-1173558.html\">Oval Mansions</a> in London. With 60 flats and its own thriving art gallery, it was one of London's most notorious squatted buildings, long abandoned by Lambeth council. The award-winning artist Gillian Wearing squatted there before me, as did Ian Dury, who dubbed the building Catshit Mansions and wrote most of his best songs there. The experimental electro duo Pan Sonic were also in residence, alongside teachers, social workers and many others.</p> <p>The tenants maintained the building for nearly three decades \u2013 doing what the council should have been doing \u2013 until someone at Lambeth realised they were sitting on a property goldmine. In 2001, the squatters were evicted, the building sold to developers and a two-bedroom, cat-shit free flat will now<a href=\"http://www.winkworth.co.uk/sale/property/KEN110481\"> cost more than half a million pounds</a>.</p> <p>This most rightwing of rulings marks a dark day for the homeless and the poor \u2013 and for British pop culture.</p>",
  "<h2>Glue for gold</h2> <p>Oscar Pistorius's <a href=\"http://www.ossur.com/?PageID=13462\" title=\"\">Flex-Foot Cheetah running blades</a>, made by the global orthopaedic firm Ossur, always promised to be the most photographed piece of equipment at the Paralympics. And interest has only intensified following his loss to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/sep/03/oscar-pistorius-stride-length-oliveira\" title=\"\">Alan Oliveira</a> in the 200m \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/03/paralympics-oscar-pistorius-angry-loss\" title=\"\">his angry complaint that the length of the Brazilian's blades should not have been permitted</a>.</p> <p>\"In prosthetics, everything is open to interpretation,\" says Donna Fisher, of Ottobock, which make blades for Germany's Heinrich Popow and Australia's Kelly Cartwright. \"The longer the blade is, the longer the stride can be. And the blade acts like a spring, so the longer you make the lever-arm, the more you get from that. But every person is different \u2013 it's impossible to come up with a rule that applies to everyone.\" Pistorius argued that he \"couldn't compete\" with OIiveira's stride length, though<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/interactive/2012/sep/03/pistorius-oliveira-paralympics-2012-interactive\"> analysis shows the South African took fewer strides</a>.</p> <p>The point of running blades, of course, is to replace an athlete's calves and feet. But what about their spiked shoes? Running spikes are difficult to attach to a smooth, hard carbon-fibre blade. So until February, Pistorius had to spend hours scuffing his up and gluing on new spikes before each race. The balance was different each time.</p> <p>To solve the problem, <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670487/how-nike-made-track-spikes-for-oscar-pistorius-s-carbon-fiber-blades\" title=\"\">Nike, one of his sponsors, developed a detachable cushioned pad of spikes</a>. Designer Tobie Hatfield spent months watching slow-motion footage of Pistorius running on a pressure-sensitive treadmill in Ossur's Iceland HQ. Through this, he learned more about the ideal number of spikes (11) and where to put them. There's soft foam at the back of the pad, where Pistorius's stride begins, and a harder type at the front where it ends. Gluing time is now down to 15 minutes per leg. Jerome Singleton, Pistorius's rival in the 100m, is also sponsored by Nike, so he'll be running in a pair as well.</p> <h2>Formula One wheelchairs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395595845\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/3/1346681416406/Para2---5000m-gold-medall-010.jpg\" alt=\"Para2 - 5,000m gold medallist David Weir\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goodbye upholstery ... 5,000m gold medallist David Weir.

The shape and structure of the chairs, the materials they're made from, the athletes' riding position, clothes, helmets and even the straps they use to hold themselves in place \u2013 all these things are constantly being scrutinised and improved. And following a big push from UK Sport and its sponsors, British times have come down by as much as 10% in the past two years.</p> <p>\"It's an evolution,\" says Dan Chambers, a designer at <a href=\"http://www.draftwheelchairs.com/draft-at-the-paralympics/\" title=\"\">Draft wheelchairs</a>, which supplies the British team as well as some of its competitors. \"Athletes like these get a new chair every year, so each time there's the chance to make small changes. In the last couple of years, a lot of work has been done to increase the stiffness of chairs. Flex is not wanted, because it misaligns the wheels, which makes them scrub on the track and lose energy.\"</p> <p>Aerodynamic work has also been important. Wheelchair racers such as Shelly Woods (who came eighth in the 5,000m but still has the marathon and other distances to come) and David Weir (who took the 5,000m gold) have <a href=\"http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/articles.aspx?index=775\" title=\"\">had their shapes scanned and analysed by computers</a>, and have <a href=\"http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_045874/bae-systems-helps-paralympic-athletes-go-for-gold-with-technology-boost?_afrWindowId=null&amp;baeSessionId=TnGLQ9VNn493c7vSfpMpXgGxVsSyhkQhL27dYXs53nmSD2f1s5jP!-1218524554&amp;_afrLoop=414832906062000&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=wlcpo9dh_4&amp;baeSessionId=LFp1QGBJxQXDX1162BqqZYhh1nkq19VMLVLnJgHkgvJF0nh2psTw!92979655#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26baeSessionId%3DTnGLQ9VNn493c7vSfpMpXgGxVsSyhkQhL27dYXs53nmSD2f1s5jP%2521-1218524554%26baeSessionId%3DLFp1QGBJxQXDX1162BqqZYhh1nkq19VMLVLnJgHkgvJF0nh2psTw%252192979655%26_afrLoop%3D414832906062000%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D25qx725px_4\">even been blown about in wind tunnels</a> \u2013 all to reduce drag. The results have helped them select helmets and clothing, and have strongly influenced their seating. \"They've all been rotated forwards,\" Chambers explains, \"which reduces their frontal area.\"</p> <p>For these games, the new chairs have a solid aluminium plate beneath the athletes' knees, which allows smoother airflow than the old cloth upholstery. Each competitor also has a bespoke welded seat gripping their lower body. \"There is a chair that's been developed through all the wind-tunnel testing, which is a very nice stiff light carbon-fibre one,\" adds Chambers. \"But that's for the next Olympics.\"</p> <h2>Straps, stirrups and seatbelts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395595846\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/3/1346681624138/Para3---discus-thrower-De-010.jpg\" alt=\"Para3 - discus thrower Derek Derenalagi with his specially designed stool.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strapped in ... discus thrower Derek Derenalagi with his specially designed stool.

Olympic throwers rely on nimble feet as well as upper-body strength to wind up, throw, and then recover. Try sitting in a chair while throwing a discus and you'll almost certainly fall over \u2013 and if you throw as hard as Derek Derenalagi, the former British soldier who lost his legs in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan five years ago, you'll probably break a bone as well.</p> <p>Paralympic rules allow competitors to use any chair or frame they want, as long as they can assemble and dismantle it within a certain time limit. Alison O'Riordan, Derenalagi's coach, was unhappy with his throwing frame, however, so she contacted the charity Remap, who build customised equipment for disabled people. A Remap engineer watched Derenalagi training and then <a href=\"http://www.remap.org.uk/remap-case-studies/derek-paralympian-discusthrowe.html\" title=\"\">designed an extremely strong but lightweight padded stool</a>. Four straps secure it to the ground, two seatbelts hold Derenalagi on top, and stirrups give his prosthetic feet purchase.</p> <p>It is far from complicated, but it is precisely what Denelagi needs, holding his lower body in place while allowing the rest of him to move. \"I can use what is left of my leg muscles and my core muscles to keep control, and also to generate power,\" he says. Although Derenalagi didn't get a medal in these games, in June his chair helped him to gold at the European Championships, beating the reigning world champion in the process.</p> <h2>Crash, bounce, wallop</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395595847\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/3/1346681832468/para4--Great-Britain-take-010.jpg\" alt=\"para4- Great Britain take on Germany at wheelchair basketball.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'The chairs get absolutely smashed' ...

The player can be substituted and the chair repaired, if that is possible, but it often isn't.</p> <p>As a result, design in this area focuses on the trade-off between strength and weight. Sheen has conducted a lot of stress analysis, using 3D simulations to determine the strongest frame and, after years of making titanium chairs, has switched to a high-grade aluminium model for these games.</p> <p>\"It's much lighter,\" he explains. \"Essentially, that means it's easier to push. It also makes it a bit more responsive, so you can turn and manoeuvre better.\" The British teams, who at time of writing were both still in contention, have had the new chairs for a year now and love them. At the Paralympic World Cup in May, the women took gold, and the men silver. So there's room for improvement, but not a lot.</p> <h2>The unsinkable stool</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395595848\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/3/1346682079736/para5-Danielle-Brown-in-a-010.jpg\" alt=\"para5 Danielle Brown in action.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mud-proof ...

When she was 16, she defeated a field of able-bodied competitors at the national junior championships, using just an adapted piece of old bicycle frame to prop her up.</p> <p>As an adult, she approached Loughborough university's Sports Technology Institute to ask if they could do better. They could. The trouble with the bike frame was that it lacked stability, and had a tendency to sink into the mud. <a href=\"http://sti.lboro.ac.uk/Danielle-Brown.aspx\" title=\"\">So Steve Carr and a team of engineers redesigned it</a> with a broader base, wide feet, and a locking setup and alignment system, to help her find consistency in her position \u2013 even outdoors.</p> <p>Within a week of using the new stool, Brown had beaten her personal best. The following week, she broke the world record, and subsequently broke it again to win gold at the 2008 Paralympics. In 2010, she became the first disabled athlete to represent England in a mainstream event when she was part of the team that won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. If she wins Tuesday's semi-final, consistency will indeed be what she's found.</p> <h2>A leg of honour<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395595849\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/3/1346682282465/para6-010.jpg\" alt=\"para6\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedal power ....

  "<p>The Christian girl who was allegedly framed for blasphemy by her local mullah has been hailed as a \"daughter of the nation\" by one of Pakistan's most senior Islamic clerics, who also vowed to guarantee her safety if she is eventually released from prison.</p> <p>The heavyweight support for Rimsha Masih from the chairman of the All Pakistan Ulema Council, a grouping of Islamic clerics, is being seen as a remarkable turn of events in a country where individuals accused of insulting Islam are almost never helped by powerful public figures.</p> <p>In a fiery press conference at a central Islamabad hotel, Hafiz Mohammad Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, flanked by other senior clerics, demanded all the organs of the Pakistani state come together to investigate the circumstances surrounding the arrest last month of a girl who it is claimed has Down's syndrome.</p> <p>He also lambasted Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti, the imam from the Mehrabadi slum neighbourhood on the edge of Islamabad, who was accused over the weekend of tampering with evidence in order to ensure the girl's conviction.</p> <p>\"Our heads are bowed with shame for what Chishti did,\" Ashrafi said.</p> <p>He later said Chishti was merely the front man for other individuals \"behind the scene\" who wanted to stoke local antagonism against the Christian minority in the area in order to force them to flee.</p> <p>\"I have known for the last three months that some people in this area wanted the Christian community to leave so they could build a madrasa there,\" he said.</p> <p>Ashrafi said he would divulge more information about the people behind the alleged effort to construct an Islamic seminary on the properties vacated by the Christians at a later date.</p> <p>The cleric, who has in the past been associated with the Defence of Pakistan Council, which includes members of banned militant groups, was speaking hours after a judge's decision to further delay a bail hearing for Rimsha until later in the week.</p> <p>Lawyers acting for Malik Hammad, a man from Rimsha's neighbourhood who claims to have caught her carrying away the charred remains of a book that included verses from the Qur'an, said they could not conduct a trial because the Punjab Bar Association was holding a one-day strike.</p> <p>However, the case against Chishti continued to grow after two more witnesses recorded statements implicating the mullah in a plot to strengthen the case against Rimsha.</p> <p>The imam was accused late last week by his own deputy, Hafiz Mohammad Zubair, who told police that after Chishti was presented with the burnt refuse spotted by Malik he added two pages from the Qur'an.</p> <p>\"I asked him what he was doing and he said this is the evidence against them and this is how we can get them out from this area,\" Zubair told a Pakistani television station.</p> <p>It is the first time in a blasphemy case that someone has ever been arrested for fabricating evidence \u2013 although it remains unclear why it took more than two weeks for Zubair to come forward with the incriminating statement.</p> <p>Gabriel Francis, a lawyer at Pakistan's supreme court, said the atmosphere of fear surrounding the blasphemy law probably deterred him.</p> <p>\"It is very hard to come forward when in previous cases a governor and a minister were killed for speaking out,\" he said, referring to Shahbaz Bhatti, a former minorities minister, and Salman Taseer, the former governor of the Punjab. Both men were assassinated last year after they infuriated extremists by publicly criticising the blasphemy laws.</p> <p>On Sunday, Ashrafi said he had been moved to speak out after reading reports that Rimsha had Down's syndrome, a condition that also affects Ashrafi's 15-year-old son. He said the Ulema Council would guarantee Rimsha's security from vigilantes or extremists if she was released.</p> <p>\"It would be against the honour of the country to send someone out of Pakistan due to non-provision of security at government level,\" a joint statement by the Ulema Council and the Pakistan Interfaith League said.</p> <p>However, Ashrafi said there was no need to change or repeal the law \u2013 despite campaign groups claiming it is wide open to abuse and allows people to be sentenced to life imprisonment on the basis of threadbare evidence that is often never challenged in court.</p> <p>\"There is no problem with the law \u2013 only the implementation of the law is the problem,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Aleksandr Georgievich Semenov patented an efficiently disgusting weapon system. Using his method, soldiers inside an armoured tank, under battle conditions, can dispose of their biological waste products in an unwasteful way: encasing those materials, together with explosives, in artillery shells that they then fire at the enemy.</p> <p>Semenov, residing in St Petersburg, can and does brag of having Russian <a href=\"http://www.fips.ru/cdfi/Fips2009.dll/CurrDoc?SessionKey=T0QGJ21R3JHZJ7BHHGUH&amp;GotoDoc=1&amp;Query=1\" title=\"\">patent #2399858</a>, granted in 2009, officially titled Method of Biowaste Removal From Isolated Dwelling Compartment of Military Facility And Device or Its Implementation.</p> <p>As patents go, it's of modest length: 12 pages, with only two technical drawings. The original document is mostly in Russian. The prolific inventor (he has about 200 other patents), sent me a full translation into English.</p> <p>Figure 2 seems, at a glance, unremarkable: a cutaway side view of an artillery shell in its cartridge, tipped with a screw-in \"nose cone\". There's a large charge to (in Semenov's description) \"burst\" the shell, and a small charge to trigger that burst. The shell itself contains \u2013 indeed is mostly \u2013 a compartment for the payload.</p> <p>Figure 1 is larger and more complex, showing the entire tank in cutaway side view. A single crewman perches inside. Beneath him, an empty shell collects the waste that emerges from his anus.</p> <p>Here's how the patent describes the scene, with numbers referring to specific items in the drawing:</p> <p>\"A military man (3) puts the wastes (8) into the capacity (7) directly (fig.1) or in two steps. After it's complete or, if it is necessary, incomplete filling the capacity is tightly sealed by the cover.\"</p> <p>The key action is in one sentence: \"The gun charged with special projectile is targeted on a safety zone or on any enemy target which is worth for catching it.\"</p> <p>As the projectile leaves the tank, it removes what would eventually have become a source of stinking misery for the poor soldiers who, in combat, could be forced to remain sealed inside their vehicle for several days.</p> <p>That misery transfers directly, forcefully away through the air, smacking into and dabbing onto the enemy.</p> <p>This method of warfare aims to kill the enemy's spirit and psyche. The patent conveys this fact in spirited, if not belletristic, language:</p> <p>\"Except damaging factors, significance of which is secondary in this case, the military psychological positive effect takes place: comprehension of the facts of 'delivering' and distribution on enemy territory (on equipment and uniform of an enemy) by the staff as well as the opportunity of informing other soldiers and the enemy about it. As a result, in addition to the basic purpose reaching (full wastes removal) additional military-psychological and military-political effects are achieved.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize</p>",
  "<p>Dredd, which arrives in UK cinemas later this week, has had a chequered path to production: director Pete Travis was <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/10/director-drama-heats-up-on-dredd.html\" title=\"\">reportedly locked out of the editing suite at one stage while screenwriter Alex Garland finished the film</a>. The pair later issued a statement in which they denied Travis had been ousted and put to rest rumours that Garland might seek a co-director's credit. Nevertheless, the whole affair hardly invited optimism.</p> <p>Whoever's stamp is on the final cut \u2013 and Travis was missing from the special screening I attended last week in London, while Garland held centre-stage \u2013 there are no signs that the film has suffered from the lack of a unified vision. In fact there is nothing muddled or vague about the second adaptation of the <a href=\"http://www.2000adonline.com/\" title=\"\">2000 AD</a> comic strip Judge Dredd to hit cinemas (after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/60739/judge-dredd\" title=\"\">1995's misfiring Sylvester Stallone vehicle</a>). It is the very definition of a lean, direct, no-holds-barred action movie \u2013 albeit a stylish and atmospheric one \u2013 so much so that some might even leave the cinema wondering if the creative team could have spent a little more time getting under the skin of their hero.</p> <p>As 2000 AD aficionados will know, that would have been an error. Dredd, which takes place in a sprawling future megalopolis of 800 million people policed by all-powerful Judges, is refreshingly free of the angsty navel-gazing that usually accompanies big-screen comic book instalments, and that's just as it should be. Mega-City One's best known lawman (here played by a Clint Eastwood-channelling Karl Urban) never was your traditional Marvel/DC-style superhero, with a love interest, a private life and a secret list of hangups. If anyone ever did manage to lift that famous helmet and peer through the windows to his soul, they'd be highly unlikely to discover even the merest flicker of doubt or uncertainty. Dredd-style justice means making a split-second decision and sticking to it, even if that means consigning a \"perp\" to serve the rest of his or her life in a solitary jail cell known as an \"isocube\". You never look back.</p> <p>Following that breezy but brutal mantra to the letter, Garland and Travis have given us a tight, 95-minute movie that leaves no time at all for the narrative to get swamped in expansive ideas or emotional intrigue. At one point, after we have witnessed epic scenes of giant buildings being blown apart, criminals splattering on the pavement after 80-storey drops and spectacular gun battles between the law and the bad guys, someone asks Dredd what he's been up to that day. \"Drug bust\", comes the functional, typically understated reply. The film feels like the extended pilot episode of a really, really good TV series, and that's absolutely fine: it leaves plenty room for the second and third instalments to grow in scope and stature should the first movie prove a success.</p> <p>Where Dredd exceeds expectations is in its realisation. The drug bust in question centres on a gargantuan tower block ruled by villain Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), who rules with an iron fist while hooking up the inhabitants with (apparently) high-quality supplies of the intoxicant slo-mo. Smoking this stuff causes the user to experience a time-stretched haze in which a second feels like an hour, and so on and so forth. This dreamy, opaque existence is extended to and borrowed for the film's atmospheric sequences, which are peppered with wonderfully washed out musical interludes from Scottish composer Paul Leonard-Morgan. At key moments the very fabric of the universe seems to split and bulge at a molecular level, vividly shifting and refracting before the viewer's eyes. It's brilliantly ambitious stuff that adds a real touch of otherworldly class.</p> <p>Urban's Judge Dredd doesn't just borrow his gruff brogue from Eastwood: there's a measured minimalism and brooding scorn of unnecessary fuss there too which recalls the latter's best work. Olivia Thirlby is also strong as the psychic rookie Anderson, based on the comic's Psi-Judge Anderson, though again there's not a lot going on under the hood. In fact there are no real grandstanding performances in Dredd, no scenery chewing and little bombastic chest-thumping. It is a long way from the over-the-top, Paul Verhoevenesque sci-fi satire one might have expected, but what it lacks in larger-than-life villains \u2013 a staple of the comics \u2013 and futuristic silliness (there are no fatties or mutants to be seen) it makes up for with elegant cinematography and cerebellum-twisting special effects.</p> <p>\"So far, the response from Dredd fans that have seen the film has been very positive,\" Garland told me afterwards. \"But actually, they were supportive of the film from day one. I read the 2000 AD message board throughout the production, and always felt they were on our side.\"</p> <p>Early reviews suggest that the critics are also supportive. The film, a British production from DNA Films, currently has a 100% \"fresh\" rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, though from a small 12-review sample. Fingers crossed that fans of hard-hitting science fiction will come out to see it, because a world in which more movies like Dredd hit our multiplexes would be a future I think we'd all like to live in.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article was amended on 4 September. The original stated that Dredd was released next month. In fact it is released this Friday, the 7 September</p>",
  "<p>Fire climates \u2013 places with little rainfall, lots of wind and long spells when it is hot and dry \u2013 are perfect for some species. Woodland giants like the sequoias of the west coast of North America release seed when their cones are heated to temperatures that only fire can reach. A lodgepole pine may hold its cones for half a century until the right conflagration comes along.</p> <p>Big trees like firs, spruces and sequoias that live for 1,000 years or more can be extraordinarily resilient to heat and flame. When a forest fire reaches the canopy, gases burn at around 1000C. In such a life span, an individual tree might survive several so-called \"century fires\" (confusingly these great fires occur every 200-300 years).</p> <p>Forest fires are also part of the cycle of pioneering microbial life forms and fire beetles \u2013 the latter have fire detectors hundreds of times more sensitive than the kind installed in our homes \u2013 rush to fires when they sense them.</p> <p>We can marvel at the brilliance of life that can adapt to thrive in such astonishing ways, while acknowledging the odd vulnerability to a changing climate of our own species.</p> <p>For good reason, the <a href=\"http://www.coastsalishgathering.com/\" title=\"\">Coast Salish people</a> of the Pacific Rim lived in fear of forest fires. The fires were embodied in some of their most terrifying spirits and gods. Neither they nor myriad animals of the woods could survive a century fire. Escape, if possible, was the only solution. Yet the way that great fires spread once established makes escape unpredictable at best. Burning missiles from the main fire shoot out to create satellite fires. These then combine into one immense, furious furnace. Great areas ignite spontaneously at a certain tipping point, the temperature for the combustion of plant matter.</p> <p>At a much greater scale, with global warming, we now risk triggering a sequence of system-shifting events. Think of this more as an \"aeon fire\" than a century fire, in which we default to an unpredictable new, more hostile climate, very different to that in which human civilisation evolved. It will take millennia to shift back to a more convivial world, if indeed such a reversal ever occurs.</p> <p>What informs the optimism of some, and perhaps the complacency of others, is that like life in general, we are incredibly innovative. There's an assumption that whatever happens, we'll sort things out. But now, having adapted to one climate with all its weather-related slings and arrows, we're going beyond its cycle of normal variation. If we don't stay on the right side of the combustion point for irreversible warming effects, we don't know if, or in what shape human civilisation will continue.</p> <p>One reason for the success of trees, point out the American conservationists David Suzuki and Wayne Grady, is their collective nature: \"No tree is an island; it is a communal citizen and derives \u2026 benefits from cooperation, sharing, and mutual effort.\"</p> <p>The tiny, purposeful hummingbird can be seen all around the forests of the northern Pacific Rim. Its industry was noted by First Nation people who passed on this story.</p> <blockquote> \"A fire had begun in the forest and was in danger of raging out of control. Terrified, many of the animals fled before it took over. But the hummingbird flew to the nearest water, collected a droplet and flew back to the fire dropping the water onto it. As she flew back and forth to protect her habitat, first the bear, and then the owl, the snake and cougar each called out: 'Bird, what are you doing?' The hummingbird answered them all in the same way: 'I am doing what I can'.\" </blockquote> <p>Next month is the halfway point in our countdown to when the odds shift against us in the likelihood of staying on the right side of the climate threshold. To celebrate optimism and \"doing what I can\", we will mark it by publishing some of the best ideas for change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jul/02/lead-climate-predicament\" title=\"\">that were submitted through this column to the Guardian</a>, and examples of specially commissioned articles from people who lead their own fields and are changing their own lives.

  "<p>It used to be so easy: your photographs filled up boxes and albums; your CDs, books and films filled up shelves; your thoughts and ideas filled up notebooks and diaries, and when you died there were physical things to be distributed among your family and friends.</p> <p>Technology has changed the way we keep and share our memories, and also the way many of us own our books and music. News that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/03/bruce-willis-apple-itunes-library\" title=\"Bruce Willis to fight Apple over right to leave iTunes library in will\">Bruce Willis is reportedly considering legal action against Apple</a> to make sure he can leave his virtual record collection to his daughters will have surprised anyone who thought their online possessions were theirs to dispose of as they choose. So what rights do you have over the accounts and goods that exist only virtually?</p> <p>\"Across the world the law is in a state of flux \u2013 it hasn't evolved to keep up with innovation in digital content,\" says Jas Purewal, interactive entertainment and digital media lawyer at Osborne Clarke. \"It is set up to deal with physical goods, and it is not clear therefore what the position is with social network accounts, iTunes accounts, your subscription to Netflix, and so on.\"</p> <p>There are not yet statutory laws around ownership of virtual goods, nor is there case law. The EU is looking at consumer protection in this area, but nothing has yet been passed, so Purelaw says it is being left to the providers of content to decide what they will allow consumers to do with items they buy and share online. He says there are promising signs judges recognise that virtual content can be owned like physical content, citing the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12357005\" title=\"BBC: Hacker faces jail over poker chip theft\">2011 case of a man jailed for stealing online poker chips</a>.</p> <h2>Music and films</h2> <p>You might be surprised to find that in most cases you are effectively leasing the content, not buying it. This is because you are generally being sold a licence to use the song or film, not the item itself. Where the music is downloaded on to a device you can leave that to someone, but you cannot leave instructions to share out the holdings in your iTunes account after you are gone.</p> <p>When it comes to the account's contents, \"from a legal perspective there is nothing to leave,\" Purewal says. He works with online entertainment companies and says: \"I can't think of any digital content providers who freely and openly allow the passage of ownership from one person to another.\" Either the terms and conditions will explicitly rule out sharing downloads, or will use language which implicitly rules against it.</p> <p>Workarounds are possible: you could share your password and other account details with your family or even the person who will execute your estate, but you will be taking a risk as the content provider could suspend the account. But if US courts do decide iTunes has to allow users to pass on licences, this whole area may be opened up.</p> <h2>Books</h2> <p>As with music and films, when you die your virtual library will die with you. Amazon tells Kindle users: \"The purchase and download of digital content from Amazon.co.uk, including content from the Kindle Store, is associated with the Amazon.co.uk account used to make the original purchase. As a result, Kindle content cannot be shared like a physical book.\"</p> <p>So you can't move a book from one device to another, and you won't be able to split up a collection of books between family and friends. You could leave the device holding your collection to someone else, but if they needed to access the account for any reason they could run in to difficulties. Again, you cannot leave it to someone else with complete certainty.</p> <h2>Social media</h2> <p>\"Most social media account holders are bound by their terms of business, and it is common for executors to be unable to access a deceased's customers account,\" says Nick Rhodes, associate solicitor at Blacks Solicitors. \"The service providers seem reluctant to allow access as the accounts contain personal data about the deceased and fear breaching privacy rights. There is no established legislation or cases dealing with the release of personal data to executors.\"</p> <p>Facebook's terms and conditions include the line: \"You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission\", which effectively rules out handing over your account when you die. However, it will let your family turn your page into a memorial page, provided they provide proof of your death.</p> <p>Twitter says that when you sign up it \"gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software\", which implies an account cannot be transferred. It seems unlikely it would pursue an individual for logging into a relative's account after their death, but there are inactivity rules. Your account will not stay around forever if nothing is happening with it.</p> <p>Yahoo!, which owns the photo-sharing site Flickr as well as running a webmail service, also states that users are granted \"personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right and licence\" to use its software. It also makes it clear in its terms and conditions that it reserves the right to shut down inactive accounts. This is worth bearing in mind if you want to pass on photos which you are storing online \u2013 the account holding them could be deleted one day.</p> <p>Despite these rules some companies are trying to trade on the idea that people may want to leave their accounts to their families when they die. <a href=\"http://www.Loccit.com\" title=\"Loccit homepage\">Loccit</a>, for example, offers to pull together your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare accounts to create an online version of \"the secret shoebox of photos and memories we used to keep as children\".</p> <h2>iCloud</h2> <p>Apple is very clear about ownership of iCloud accounts. It states in its terms and conditions: \"You agree that your Account is non-transferable and that any rights to your Apple ID or Content within your Account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate your Account may be terminated and all Content within your Account deleted.\"</p> <h2>Emails</h2> <p>English law states that the copyright of emails and other material stored online forms part of people's estates, and should therefore pass to executors. However, lawyers say internet service providers do not always allow access. There can also be jurisdictional issues where ISPs may be based in a different country to where the user lived.</p> <p>Rhodes says anyone worried about their digital legacy should \"have a will stating that chosen executors have the right to access social accounts and digital assets, and to direct the executors on how the accounts and assets shall be dealt with.</p> <p>\"If the executors still meet resistance from the online providers then they could apply to court for an order allowing them to deal with everything in accordance with the will.\"</p> <p>However, he says it remains to be seen how a court would react.</p>",
  "<p>If the financial crisis put an end to the golden age of company takeovers, no one bothered to tell the beer industry \u2013 the world's biggest breweries continue to have an insatiable thirst for empire expansion.</p> <p>Heineken has just taken a big step towards completing the latest money-spinning deal as it gained the approval it needs to buy Asia Pacific Breweries, makers of Tiger beer, for up to \u00a34.1bn. It comes two years after it bought Femsa Cerveza, makers of Sol beer, in Mexico for $7.6bn (\u00a34.8bn).</p> <p>The Dutch brewer is not alone \u2013 last year rival SABMiller, which makes Peroni and Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell among others \u2013 snapped up Foster's for a cool \u00a37.5bn.</p> <p>And in 2008 a \u00a333bn merger created the world's biggest brewer by putting together Anheuser-Busch and InBev \u2013 a megadeal that united Budweiser, Beck's, Stella Artois and Hoegaarden.</p> <p>Heineken's new-found taste for Asian and Mexican beer is not hard to understand. As people get richer in the emerging markets of Latin America, China and Africa, the drinkers of Europe and North America become increasingly irrelevant to the global brewers.</p> <p>In Africa some in the industry believe the continent could soon outgrow both North America and Europe. Only last week SABMiller opened a multimillion-pound brewery in Nigeria.</p> <p>But the biggest cash cow, as in so many industries, could be in China, where the popularity of beer has increased rapidly alongside the traditional desire for spirits. The country already accounts for one in four pints sold worldwide, double that of the US, and could account for 40% of total worldwide sales by 2016.</p> <p>Twenty years ago the Chinese barely touched beer, drinking an average of just 12 pints per person each year. By 2001 that consumption had nearly trebled to 32 pints; last year it was 63. By 2021 the number of pints consumer per head is expected to increase to 93.</p> <p>Ian Shackleton, from Japanese bank Nomura, said recently: \"Historically, China has had a strong 'spirits culture', with consumption skewed towards the Chinese traditional spirit baijiu. Beer, as a proportion of total alcohol, increased from 21% in 1997 to 51% in 2011, with the beer category growing at the expense of local, cheap spirits.\"</p> <p>AB InBev is expected to generate 6% of its group profits by 2021 from China, compared with just 1% last year, while SABMiller \u2013 which owns a 50% stake in China's most popular beer, Snow \u2013 will take 19% of its profits from the country. It currently takes 2%.</p> <p>The Heineken deal for Asia Pacific Breweries is important enough that the Dutch firm has increased its initial offer to buy out its joint venture partner Fraser and Neave (F&amp;N), after ThaiBev's billionaire owner, Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, made a counter bid.</p> <p>Heineken and F&amp;N formed a partnership in 1931 and jointly control a majority stake in Singapore-based Asia Pacific. The&#xa0;Dutch brewer wants to buy out F&amp;N's&#xa0;40% stake to increase its far east business interests and eventually take full control of the company. It currently has a 42% stake.</p> <p>An offer of S$53 (\u00a326) a share has been approved by F&amp;N's board and will be put to shareholders. However, 40% of those shareholders are rivals ThaiBev and Kirin, with the latter already trying to derail the bid by offering S$55 a share, causing Heineken to increase its initial S$50 a share bid.</p> <p>ThaiBev \u2013 maker of Chang beer \u2013 knows how important the deal is for Heineken, which needs the new markets to reduce its reliance on a poor-performing European region.</p> <p>Analyst John Mullane, from Dolmen Stockbrokers, explained: \"This deal is a positive development for Heineken because they have been overexposed in a weak European market, and behind the curve in exploiting growth opportunities in emerging markets.</p> <p>\"The fact they are willing to pay such a high premium shows how keen they are to expand in these markets and how important it is for them.\"</p> <p>Alcoholic drinks analyst at Euromonitor International, Zsuzsa Szilagyi, agreed.</p> <p>She said: \"There are very few targets left to acquire, which is why it is very important for Heineken, because it doesn't have its own presence in the region.</p> <p>\"The leading players are building their presence very smartly. There is sluggish growth in mature markets at the moment, so companies have to find growth prospects elsewhere.\"</p> <p>Despite their fast-growing appetite for beer, Chinese and African drinkers do have some catching up to do if they are to drink their European counterparts under the table. Admittedly, the Chinese do have some catching up to do if they are to be anywhere near the same league for drinking compared to their European counterparts.</p> <p>In terms of consumption per person, nine of the top 10 nations are in Europe \u2013 and the 10th is Australia.</p> <p>Topping the list is the Czech Republic, where an unnerving 244 pints are drunk each year on average by individuals. Ireland comes second with 195, followed by Germany with 186 pints.</p> <p>But drinking habits in Europe are changing. John Mullane from Dolmen said: \"Consumers are becoming more discerning and want higher quality and craft beers. Big breweries are recognising this and are likely to be looking at craft beers for expansion.\"</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jun/24/american-craft-beer-hippest-hops\" title=\"\">sales of craft beers</a> brewed usually by independent breweries on very small scales, have had double digit percentage increases, with Europe catching up.</p> <p>James Watt, co-founder of the Scottish craft beer firm <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/about\" title=\"\">BrewDog</a>, said companies such as his are tapping into an area that drinkers feel has been missing.</p> <p>He said: \"I think there has been a lack of choice in the UK for the last 30 to 40 years from industrial beers from monolithic brewers and we're trying to fill that gap.</p> <p>\"There has been an explosion in craft beers in the US and I think that will happen over here. People want to know how their beer is made and what's gone into it.\"</p> <p>But Watt is clear that Aberdeenshire-based BrewDog, which was started in 2007 and now has more than 60 employees and a turnover of \u00a312m, is not for sale. \"I'd sooner shoot myself in the head than sell to the big breweries. It would be like the Clash selling out to the Spice Girls.\"</p> <p>However, it won't stop the likes of Heineken, SABMiller and AB InBev continuing to reshape the beer-brewing landscape and with combined revenues of nearly \u00a350bn a year don't expect them to stop spending any time soon.</p>",

  "<p>Fears over violent unrest spreading in South Africa's mining industry grew on Monday after a police shooting at a gold mine left four workers in hospital, including one critically injured.</p> <p>The incident came as the first group of miners was released from custody following the Lonmin platinum mine massacre, in which police gunned down 34 of their colleagues.</p> <p>Rubber bullets and tear gas were used against about 60 mineworkers at the Gold One mine at Modder East near Johannesburg. Police said they were trying to disperse a group of about 200 sacked mineworkers who were attacking reinstated colleagues.</p> <p>Gold One said an illegal blockade began at around 6.30am, preventing about half of its employees from returning to work. \"The group did not present any memorandum of demands,\" a spokesman said. \"The group blocked all access in and out of the mine and threw stones at vehicles attempting to gain access to the operations.</p> <p>\"The South African Police Service (SAPS) addressed the group extensively, informing them that the gathering was illegal and requesting them to disperse. The group refused. At approximately 11.30am the SAPS had to use teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the group. Access to the Modder East Operations has since been re-established.\"</p> <p>Captain Pinky Tsinyane, a police spokeswoman, said four people had been taken to hospital, one of whom was critically injured.</p> <p>As South Africa still comes to terms with what has been described as the lowest point since the end of racial apartheid, anxiety over contagion in the mining sector has been compounded by a wildcat strike by 12,500 miners at Gold Fields' Kloof Driefontein Complex gold mine.</p> <p>Frans Baleni, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, <a href=\"http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/mining/2012/09/03/platinum-mine-revolt-shifting-to-gold-sector\" title=\"\">told South Africa's Business Day newspaper:</a>: \"The issues at Marikana are overflowing. It's quite clear that this wave of new developments on the platinum mines is coming down on us at the gold mines.\"</p> <p>Opposition accused the government of failing to tackle the wider crisis. Sej Motau, shadow labour minister for the Democratic Alliance, said: \"Labour unrest has been spreading across the mining sector following the tragedy at Lonmin's Marikana mine.\"</p> <p>Protests have been reported at Royal Bafokeng's Rasimone platinum mine, Anglo American Platinum's Thembelani mine, Eastern Platinum's Crocodile River mine and Gold Fields' Kloof Driefontein Complex gold mine, Motau added.</p> <p>\"By focusing all her efforts on establishing a peace accord at Lonmin's Marikana mine, the minister [Mildred Oliphant] is simply reacting to the most immediate symptoms of an underlying dysfunctional labour regime.\"</p> <p>As the government, unions and British-owned Lonmin resumed talks on the \"peace accord\", the first group of 42 miners was released after the dropping of fiercely controversial murder charges against them. The jubilant men, released on warning with no need for bail, sang apartheid-era struggle songs and said they were eager to get home to their families.</p> <p>The workers were among 270 arrested for public violence last month after the police opened fire on a group of protesters, killing 34 of them and wounding 78.</p> <p>Debate over what happened on the day of the massacre continues to rage. Greg Marinovich, a Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist, has published an investigation suggesting that 14 workers died some 300m away from the main site of the bloodshed. Some appeared to have been shot at close range, he argues.</p> <p>\"It is becoming clear to this reporter that heavily armed police hunted down and killed the miners in cold blood,\" he wrote on <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-08-30-the-murder-fields-of-marikana-the-cold-murder-fields-of-marikana\" title=\"\">the Daily Maverick. </a>website. \"A minority were killed in the filmed event where police claim they acted in self-defence. The rest was murder on a massive scale.\"</p> <p>In another <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-09-02-marikanas-small-koppie-14-dead-300-metres-away-from-wonderkop-why\" title=\"\">report published on Monday</a>, Marinovich claimed that individuals close to various arms of the official investigation have approached the Daily Maverick, verifying the main thrust of his argument.</p> <p>Police are also facing allegations that arrested miners were tortured in custody. On Monday officials announced that a preliminary report from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate had been handed to police minister Nathi Mthethwa.</p> <p>\"Government is concerned about allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees arrested in connection with the Marikana incident,\" said Collins Chabane, minister in the presidency.</p> <p>\"The investigation is ongoing and the minister will receive a final report with recommendations as soon as it is finalised. The minister has accordingly assured the public that should the investigation point out to any violation of the detainees by any police officer; the full might of the law will take its course.\"</p> <p>Chabane, who chairs the inter-ministerial committee dealing with the aftermath of the Marikana massacre, also sought to reassure foreign investors that South Africa is not in disarray.</p> <p>\"The tragic incident at Marikana is not a reflection of the business environment in South Africa,\" he said. \"Government remains in control of the situation and law and order continues to prevail.\"</p> <p>A group of civil society organisations \u2013 including Amnesty International, the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, Section 27 and the Marikana Solidarity Campaign \u2013 described the Marikana massacre as \"a defining moment in our history and cannot be allowed to pass without establishing the full truth, ensuring justice and providing redress for the victims and their families.\"</p> <p>It added: \"We are outraged by the emerging evidence of targeted killings at Marikana. The Marikana massacre and the subsequent callous responses of both Lonmin and several representatives of the state violate the very spirit of our constitution.\"</p>",
  "<p>When you've stared down the barrel of a gun nothing scares you any more and Joaqu\u00edn Caparr\u00f3s has stared down the barrel of a gun. Quite literally. More than 700 games into his managerial career, after years of coaching on the sand pitches of <em>regional</em> and <em>tercera</em>, five years in <em>segundas</em> A and B, and a decade in <em>primera</em>, he finally left Spain for Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax in Switzerland in July last year. Less than five weeks later and still unpaid, he was back again after the club's Chechnyan owner Bulat Chagaev burst into the dressing room after a game and threatened players and staff. While surrounded by bodyguards and armed with a gun.</p> <p>Caparr\u00f3s had only been back in the country 24 days when he was offered another job, this time at Real Mallorca. No one with a gun and a bunch of heavies here, but it wasn't exactly easy. Mallorca had had seven presidents in four years, shareholders were at each others' throats, jostling for control, and potential buyers circled. At times it was truly nasty; all too often, it reached the coach. Michael Laudrup had just walked after his assistant Erik Larsen was sacked for calling the club's vice-president and majority shareholder Lorenzo Serra Ferrer a \"bad man\" amid accusations of print assassins for presidential hire. And his predecessor Gregorio Manzano had ended up in court against the former r\u00e9gime.</p> <p>Some on the board threatened to walk if the director general did not. They didn't but very soon the Nadal family did, led by the tennis player Rafa and his uncle Miguel-Angel, the former Barcelona and Mallorca defender, who had been Laudrup's assistant and was caretaker coach. They later sold their shares but it solved little. Boardroom battles were exacerbated by the presence of the administrators. In the summer of 2010 Mallorca had lost their European place under Uefa rules and getting another one looked like a pipe dream. In 2010-11 they had finished a solitary place off relegation and now, amid the uncertainty, they had lost three games in a row. They sat 15th; again the fear was relegation.</p> <p>Fear? What fear? It didn't even matter that Caparr\u00f3s is a <em>sevillista</em> and Serra Ferrer a <em>b\u00e9tico</em> \u2013 \"the original odd couple,\" as the coach put it. On Saturday night, just under a year on from Caparr\u00f3s's arrival, Mallorca moved to the top of the table with a deserved 1-0 win over Real Sociedad. They have beaten Espanyol and drawn at M\u00e1laga. It was only for a night \u2013 Barcelona took the lead back on Sunday with a nervy 1-0 win over Valencia \u2013 and Caparr\u00f3s dismissed it as little more than \"anecdotal\" but this is not simply coincidence.</p> <p>This is the coach who took Recreativo de Huelva up from the Second Division B and won promotion to the first division with Sevilla, then taking them to eighth place; who took Athletic into Europe and to a first Copa del Rey final in 25 years. His detractors insist that he had to depart for Sevilla and Athletic to reach their full potential and to play the kind of football that truly delighted the fans; his defenders insist that he laid the groundwork that Juande Ramos and Marcelo Bielsa built upon. That their success is partly his.</p> <p>Caparr\u00f3s took over at Mallorca last September and did not win in seven but bit by bit he imposed his authority on the team. Threatened by relegation (although their position was not quite as dramatic as it was portrayed), they were safe with four games to go when they beat Zaragoza 1-0 and by the end of the season, they had lost just eight of their 31 games under him. When Mallorca travelled to the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u on the last day of last season they had won seven of their previous 11 and still had a chance of qualifying for Europe. Unthinkable a few months earlier. During his spell in charge, Mallorca were the country's fourth best side. And then in the summer, Mallorca did what Mallorca do: they sold their best players. Ivan Ramis headed for Wigan and Chori Castro went to Real Sociedad. In total, nine players departed. It still didn't matter.</p> <p>Caparr\u00f3s lives his football intensely. \"My blood is at boiling point,\" he announced before one derby. It always is. He parades up and down the touchline, tracking the linesman, heading the crosses, screaming and shouting, barely able to stand still. During one game when he was coach of Athletic Bilbao he allowed Canal Plus to fit him up with a heart-rate monitor. His heart reached 170 beats per minute. That intensity is the keynote of his teams. \"If we don't play at 100%,\" he said this weekend, \"we're nothing.\"</p> <p>Players describe Caparr\u00f3s as extremely charismatic; as funny as he can be furious. He connects well with his players: Daniel Alves still credits Caparr\u00f3s with making him and Jes\u00fas Navas says he is \"everything\". It was he who made Julio Baptista, signed as a defensive midfielder, into a forward. The result? Fifty goals in two seasons. He has studied journalism and understands not only how to keep the media on side but also how to deliver messages. Dressing-room walls get covered with press cuttings and the team join in a huddle before every game. He has always insisted on having players that carry his demands onto the pitch: Pep Mart\u00ed, his leader at Sevilla, is at Mallorca now and the Portuguese centre-back Jos\u00e9 Nunes, now in his eighth season at the club, leads from the defence.</p> <p>Then there are the kids. Iker Muni\u00e1in, Adri\u00e1n Lopez, Sergio Ramos, Jes\u00fas Navas and Markel Susaeta all made their debuts under him. And in times of financial crisis \u2013 Mallorca must repay \u20ac4.5m a year to their creditors \u2013 that is vital. Of Mallorca's starting XI on Saturday, Ximo, Nsu\u00e9, Pina, and Pereira all played at Mallorca B. Pedro Bigas, another youth teamer, was his staring centre-back for the opening two games.</p> <p>When he was at Athletic Bilbao, Caparr\u00f3s made a tougher, more aggressive player <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/sep/21/athletic-bilbao-fernando-llorente-la-liga\" title=\"\">out of Fernando Llorente</a>. It is something he does with all of his players. His training is focused on unity, competitiveness and defensive solidity. On getting it right, over and over. His sessions, another says, are \"not especially groundbreaking\". Yet they are intense: three sessions a day during pre-season. Players return from the summer and do not see a ball for a week. It is all about physical condition. And then, step by step, comes the ball. His teams play on the break, aggressive and swift. Set plays are worked on carefully, repeated constantly. They're not always pretty but they are pretty effective. There were eight draws last season and of Mallorca's 12 league wins under him, six of them were 1-0. \"He is not exactly a lover of good football,\" one insider puts it, \"but the results are not chance.\"</p> <p>It was 1-0 on Saturday too. Mallorca resisted Real Sociedad in the first half and blitzed them in the second. They have now won their past four home games after going in level at half-time. Pina controlled the midfield, Pereira was quick and direct, the defence solid, the goal just a matter of time. When V\u00edctor Casades\u00fas scored, it was deserved. They could have had more and they still may. Mallorca lost players as always in the summer but this time the coach had a major say in the construction of the squad. Javi M\u00e1rquez signed from Espanyol, Geromel from K\u00f6ln, and Concei\u00e7ao from Figurense. The transfer window closed with the arrival of Gio Dos Santos from Spurs. On Saturday there was already a hint of them evolving into a more attacking side; with the new arrivals, that appears more plausible. For the first time in years, the squad may be better this season than it was last.</p> <p>Mallorca are second, their highest position for five years \u2013 and even then they had lost it by week three in 2007-08. They will not stay there. But this is about more than that. Caparr\u00f3s's character, that combination of humour and charm with determination and seriousness, has pervaded the club, imposing a kind of consensus upon it. His direct, fearless approach has blown away doubts even as there were many. It has protected the dressing room from external problems and, with the results, reinforcing his authority. It has brought the unity which has always been his obsession. How long it will last is another issue but a certain sense of <em>sporting</em> stability pervades at last: even the opposition recognise that they are heading in the right direction on the pitch. Fans, despite clashes with the club, largely agree. So does the media.</p> <p>For the first time in a long time, Real Mallorca have a coach who doesn't have a pistol pointed permanently at his head.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Real Madrid beat Granada 3-0 and Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice. He didn't celebrate either of them. The reason? He is, he says, \"sad\". After the game, he appeared in the mixed zone and spoke to the media. This is what was said:</p> <p>\"Why didn't you celebrate?\"</p> <p>\"Maybe I am a bit sad.\"</p> <p>\"Why are you sad?\"</p> <p>\"People know why.\"</p> <p>\"Because of Iniesta [winning the Uefa player of the year award]?\"</p> <p>\"No, not because of that. There are more important things. That's past. I'm OK. Anyone of the three of us [Ronaldo, Iniesta, Messi] could have won it. He deserves it.\"</p> <p>\"Is it something to do with the club, then?\"</p> <p>\"I'm not going to say anything else. People know why.\"</p> <p>\"Personal or professional?\"</p> <p>\"Professional.\"</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>\"Why do you say the people know? Which people?\"</p> <p>\"People inside the club. They know. I can't say anything else.\"</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>\"Is this a passing irritation? How do you feel?\"</p> <p>\"I don't know. We'll see.\"</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>\"Why are you [sad]?\"</p> <p>\"I'm not saying anything else.\"</p> <p>Ronaldo's words sent everybody bonkers. It was the perfect storm for Spain's Sunday night shows \u2013 an excuse for everyone to shout and argue and put forward theories. According to one radio station, Ronaldo had even gone so far as to meet with Madrid's president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, on Saturday and tell him that he was not happy and did not want to stay at the club. What they did not say, oddly enough, was <em>why</em>. Has his dressing-room relationship with other players broken down? His relationship with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho? Is this a contractual battle (he has not renewed his current deal)? Is he annoyed at the treatment of his friend Kak\u00e1?</p> <p>Why so sad?</p> <p>\u2022 Sevilla got a penalty against Rayo and Alvaro Negredo stepped up to take it. As he did so, fans ever-so-politely reminded him that he is from Vallecas, began his career with them and should miss it. He did. When Sevilla got another one Ivan Rakitic took it instead. And also missed.</p> <p>\u2022 A man down and 2-0 down, Levante produced the performance of the weekend with a 3-2 win over Espanyol \u2013 finally clinched with a 90th-minute own goal.</p> <p>\u2022 Barcelona are still top, the only team with three wins from three. Not that they were very good against Valencia. And, here's news: Messi didn't score.</p> <p>Results: Celta 2-0 Osasuna, Zaragoza 0-1 M\u00e1laga, Deportivo 1-1 Getafe, Mallorca 1-0 Real Sociedad, Rayo 0-0 Sevilla, Athletic 2-0 Valladolid, Levante 3-2 Espanyol, Madrid 3-0 Granada, Barcelona 1-0 Valencia; Atl\u00e9tico v Betis postponed to 26 September.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29\" title=\"\">Latest La Liga standings</a></p>",
  "<p>For the two technology bloggers from India, it looked like a dream invitation from the electronics giant Samsung: it would pay for their flights and accommodation to cover the IFA trade fair in Berlin, where the season's biggest tech announcements are made, under an outreach programme called <a href=\"http://samsungmobilers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">\"Samsung Mobilers\"</a>.</p> <p>But the dream turned sour when Clinton Jeff and a colleague were told on arriving that they would be issued with uniforms and expected to work as staff on the booths \u2013 showing off new Samsung products to the press, rather than writing about them.</p> <p>And when the duo protested, Samsung withdrew their funding \u2013 leaving them stranded thousands of miles from home without a plane ticket back, nor means to pay their hotel bill. They were saved when a representative from Nokia, the Finnish phone company, stepped in to help the pair, sorting out flights and hotel costs.</p> <p>Though Samsung said there had been a \"misunderstanding\", the Guardian has established that France Quiquer\u00e9, a French technology blogger, has <a href=\"http://int13.net/france/blog/i-won-a-contest-to-go-to-the-london-olympic-games/\" title=\"\">levelled a similar complaint</a>, which the Guardian has established is also against Samsung.</p> <p>The incidents have exposed a dark underbelly to technology reporting and blogging \u2013 in which companies offer rewards to bloggers, who often do not acknowledge that they are writing posts not for their news value to readers, but because they want to get free products and even trips. Not disclosing such motives is against Advertising Standards Authority rules laid down in 2009, as well as the consumer protection law, as shown by a <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consumer-enforcement/consumer-enforcement-completed/handpicked_media/\" title=\"\">2010 investigation</a> by the Office of Fair Trading against a company called Handpicked Media.</p> <p>Quiquer\u00e9, who has been a \"brand ambassador\" for Samsung since 2010, was told she had won a competition to come at the company's expense to the Olympics in London in August, along with a group of bloggers. She went expecting to be a guest at events, because Samsung was a major sponsor of the Olympics, for which it paid more than $100m.</p> <p>Instead the group found that the six-day trip involved barely any visits to events. Instead they were meant to create promotional videos and photos, and fill out daily reports on what they had done. They were also instructed to upload videos of promotional events to their personal YouTube accounts \u2013 an instruction that Quiquer\u00e9 resisted strongly. She says that by the end of the five-day trip she saw two events \u2013 a table-tennis semifinal and a volleyball eliminator. \"We didn't have the chance to see the Olympic stadium or participate [in] other festive events related to the Olympics,\" Quiquer\u00e9 complained. \"The most embarrassing thing is the surreal feeling of being trapped.\"</p> <p>All the bloggers were part of Samsung's \"Mobilers\" programme, a multi-country PR scheme described in the UK as \"an exclusive network of bloggers who are first in line to trial and review the latest Samsung products, for free!\". The scheme is aimed at bloggers seen as influential by Samsung. They are encouraged to write posts about Samsung products \u2013 with subjects suggested multiple times a week \u2013 for which they earn points towards \"rewards\".</p> <p>But the Guardian has established that many of those who blog in this way do not acknowledge that they are receiving rewards for doing so \u2013 contravening the law.</p> <p>The plight of the Indian bloggers was <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/\" title=\"\">first exposed by technology news site The Next Web</a>, which calls the Mobilers programme \"Samsung's fanboy factory\" (a \"fanboy\" being an uncritical supporter of a brand, group or team). However, the pair have been criticised by peers, who said Jeff and his colleague were naive and misunderstood the communications from Samsung India.</p> <p>Jeff and his companion blogger from India, who does not want to be named, were members of the Samsung India Mobilers programme. But they were shocked by their experience at IFA, one of the world's biggest technology shows. They insist they had told Samsung that they would only travel if they could work as independent journalists and look at other companies' stands at the show. Such opportunities are rare for Indian bloggers; they had thought that the quid pro quo would be to get early views of new Samsung products which they could blog about \u2013 thus satisfying themselves and Samsung.</p> <p>However, Samsung representatives at the show insisted that they had agreed to be \"promoters\" of the product, which entailed wearing a uniform and showing off the products at its booth. When Jeff and his colleague declined to take part, they say, a Samsung India representative told them that they would be brought back immediately, unless they agreed to appear at a Samsung event wearing company T-shirts.</p> <p>After doing that, Jeff talked to a friend who contacted Nokia, which agreed to pay the duo's plane flights and hotel costs without, Jeff says, requiring any coverage or mention in return.</p> <p>Samsung said in a statement: \"Samsung Mobilers is a voluntary community of active Samsung mobile device users, who are offered the opportunity to participate in our marketing events across the world. At these events, all activities they undertake are on a voluntary basis. No activities are forced upon them.</p> <p>\"We regret there was a misunderstanding between the Samsung Mobilers coordinators and the relevant blogger, as we understand he was not sufficiently briefed on the nature of Samsung Mobilers' activities at IFA 2012. We have been attempting to get in touch with him. We respect the independence of bloggers to publish their own stories.\"</p> <p>The Mobilers marketing programme is open to bloggers, though Samsung determines who takes part. In the UK, it has more than 50 members in the scheme, and dozens more in every other country where it runs.</p> <p>Members are given \"missions\" in which they are asked to promote products or features.

Some bloggers have had a lot of pressure on this score, with some brands asking for refunds or withholding payment if a blogger discloses a freebie or payment on a post.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the course of three days in late August, I travelled from Courtroom 600 in Nuremberg, Germany, where an international military tribunal tried 21 top Nazi leaders in 1945-46, to Courtroom 2 at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Courtroom 2 is the site of proceedings against Khalid Sheik Mohammed and the four others accused of masterminding the attacks on 11 September 2001. The contrast could not be more stark.</p> <p>At Nuremberg, the US government insisted on a trial \u2013 in the face of strenuous opposition from the British and Russians, who wanted to summarily execute the most senior Nazi party members. Washington demonstrated a commitment \u2013 not without shortcomings in the course of the trials \u2013 to the uncharted path of international prosecution for monstrous crimes. In Guant\u00e1namo's Camp Justice, on the other hand, the US government is restricting the exercise of basic fair trial rights guaranteed by international and US domestic law.</p> <p>While denigrated by some critics simply as \"victor's justice\", the Nuremberg trial marked a stunning turning-point in using law to punish the most egregious crimes. It also laid the foundation for the still-evolving system of international justice, in which those responsible for mass atrocities are increasingly being held to account under law. Unlike Nuremberg, because of its expected unfairness, the 9/11 trial is unlikely to serve history as a positive reference point.</p> <p>In Courtroom 600 at Nuremberg, which I visited while attending a conference about an international justice institute at the site, I saw the wooden benches that Herman Goering and others occupied in the dock. These men, once seemingly omnipotent, believed they could exterminate millions without consequence. Their passage from power to prosecution signaled an unprecedented shift in international practice to bring to justice even the most powerful. I saw where Goering disputed the evidence against him, sparring with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Jackson\">Robert Jackson, the US supreme court justice</a> who served as America's chief prosecutor in Nuremberg. Such exchanges are fundamental to a fair trial in an adversarial proceeding. At Nuremberg, three of the accused were acquitted.</p> <p>The Nuremberg tribunal staff made herculean efforts to make the trial visible worldwide, using newsreel footage, to underscore the importance of a <em>public</em> trial. Unknown, in its day, this initiative drove home the importance of projecting the trial sessions far beyond the courtroom.</p> <p>At Guant\u00e1namo, however, the rules curtail essential rights of the defense to rebut incriminating evidence. The military commissions there allow hearsay evidence, which international tribunals permit as well. But at Guant\u00e1namo, the circumstances around which much of the evidence was obtained are considered a national security matter and even the defense lawyers, with top secret security clearance, are denied access. The prosecutor may introduce evidence the defendant has no way to challenge.</p> <p>Moreover, at Guant\u00e1namo, everything the so-called \"high-value detainees\" say is presumed classified. So, if the 9/11 defendants speak up about torture in custody, or their lawyers try to, the audio feed from the courtroom is immediately cut off and the information will never appear in the public record. These rules effectively pre-empt the confrontation at the core of due process in an adversarial trial.</p> <p>Further, an important legacy of Nuremberg was the permanent documentation of Nazi crimes; suppressing evidence in Guant\u00e1namo will prevent creation of a definitive historical record.</p> <p>In addition, in Courtroom 2 the prosecutor has a power unknown in US federal court or any international tribunal: the prosecutor can unilaterally veto a defense attorney's decision to call a witness. A defense lawyer who wishes to summon a witness must first get the prosecutor's consent. If the prosecutor says no, the lawyer must argue its merits with the prosecutor in front of the judge. This unfair allocation of power between prosecution and defense directly violates an essential fair trial principle, known as \"equality of arms\", and locks in a prosecutorial advantage that undercuts a vigorous and effective defense.</p> <p>A fair trial of the 9/11 accused at Guant\u00e1namo would renew Nuremberg's powerful example of justice being done and being seen to be done. Instead, the Obama administration, despite improvements in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Commissions_Act_of_2009\">2009 Military Commissions Act</a>, is departing from the farsighted example of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman.</p> <p>Worldwide, there is a growing awareness of the efforts that have succeeded in bringing some of those accused of the world's worst crimes to justice: Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian wartime leader; the former Liberian President Charles Taylor; and the former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. The Guant\u00e1namo trial will be compared with these proceedings. While policymakers in Washington have advocated fair trials for those implicated in ethnic cleansing and the use of rape as a weapon of war, gutting due process guarantees at Camp Justice will undercut US credibility in pressing for justice elsewhere.</p> <p>A flawed trial at Guant\u00e1namo will debase the United States' better practices and devalue US government commitments to accountability for serious crimes from Syria to Sri Lanka. Nuremberg created a powerful positive precedent; Guant\u00e1namo has the potential to mar that achievement with the stain of hypocrisy.</p>",
  "<p>A homeowner is being questioned by police after he shot two suspected burglars at his remote house in Leicestershire.</p> <p>The 35-year-old man and his wife, 43, were arrested after the break-in in the Welby area, near Melton Mowbray, in the early hours of Sunday.</p> <p>It is understood he took a legally owned shotgun and shot two of the four intruders before calling police. He and his wife were arrested in Melton on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Neither had been injured. The arrested man's mother said the couple's house had been broken into before. \"They have been robbed three or four times,\" <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4517831/999-horror-at-farm-as-couple-are-held-for-shooting-burglars.html\" title=\"\">she told the Sun. </a>\"One of them was quite nasty. They have not been injured but property has been stolen.\"</p> <p>Paramedics treated a man with shotgun injuries after the couple called police at about 12.30am, Leicestershire police said. It is understood that a second call was made by one of the suspected burglars. Later, a second man was treated for shotgun injuries after presenting himself at Leicester Royal Infirmary. The two men, whose injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, along with two others, were all arrested at the hospital on suspicion of aggravated burglary.</p> <p>The case has echoes of previous incidents that prompted debate on the amount of force householders should be permitted to use to protect their property. The case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/tonymartin\" title=\"\">Tony Martin</a>, who was given a life sentence for murder for shooting the 16-year-old burglar Fred Burras in the back at his remote Norfolk farm in 1999, became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, as he won the support of a number of politicians, commentators and members of the public. On appeal, his murder conviction was changed to manslaughter, for which he served three years in prison. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/20/appeal-court-frees-man-burglar-attack\" title=\"\">Another notorious case was that of Munir Hussain</a>, a millionaire businessman who beat an intruder with a cricket bat, leaving him with brain damage. The intruder had kidnapped Hussain's family and held them at knifepoint. Hussain was initially jailed for 30 months before the court of appeal replaced the sentence, in 2010, with 12 months' imprisonment suspended for two years. Shortly after he was freed, amid calls by Tories for a change in the law to strengthen the rights of householders who tackle burglars, David Cameron said that intruders<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/7104132/David-Cameron-burglars-leave-human-rights-at-the-door.html\" title=\"\"> \"leave their human rights outside\"</a>. The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said at the time that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/28/starmer-law-change-rejection\" title=\"\">the current law was working well</a> and did not need changing.</p> <p>A Leicestershire police spokeswoman said: \"A 35-year-old man and a 43-year-old woman were arrested in Melton on suspicion of GBH and four men aged 27, 23, 31 and 33 were arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary on suspicion of aggravated burglary.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain has assured Ecuador that Julian Assange has a double guarantee that he cannot face extradition from Sweden to the US if he were to face the death penalty or his human rights were to be breached.</p> <p>In a written statement to MPs, the foreign secretary, William Hague, said it was a \"matter of regret\" that the government of Ecuador had decided to offer asylum to Assange after Britain offered a series of assurances to Quito.</p> <p>Britain is seeking to extradite Assange to Sweden, where he faces allegations of sexual misconduct. The WikiLeaks founder, who sought protection in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in June, has been granted asylum by Quito on the grounds that he could face extradition from Sweden to the US where, it is feared, he could face the death penalty for his role in publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked US government documents.</p> <p>Hague told MPs the double guarantee meant Assange could only be extradited to the US from Sweden if both Britain and Sweden believed he would not face the death penalty and his human rights would not be breached.</p> <p>The foreign secretary said: \"Both the United Kingdom and Sweden are signatories to the European convention on human rights and the British government has complete confidence in the independence and fairness of the Swedish judicial system. As we have discussed with the government of Ecuador, the United Kingdom and Sweden robustly implement and adhere to the highest standards of human rights protection.</p> <p>\"The suggestion that Mr Assange's human rights would be put at risk by the possibility of onward extradition from Sweden to a third country is also without foundation. Not only would Sweden \u2013 as a signatory to the European convention on human rights \u2013 be required to refuse extradition in circumstances which would breach his human rights, but the authorities in Sweden would also be legally obliged to seek the United Kingdom's consent before any extradition to a non-EU member state could proceed.</p> <p>\"Our consent may only be given in accordance with the international conventions by which the UK is bound, including the European convention on human rights, and also our domestic law. In practice, this means that the United Kingdom could only consent to Mr Assange's onward extradition from Sweden to a third country if satisfied that extradition would be compatible with his human rights, and that there was no prospect of a death sentence being imposed or carried out.\"</p> <p>The foreign secretary expressed disappointment that Ecuador decided to grant asylum to Assange after officials had explained the guarantees to Quito in detail.</p> <p>\"It is a matter of regret that instead of continuing our discussions, the foreign minister of Ecuador announced on 16 August that Ecuador had decided to grant diplomatic asylum to Mr Assange&#xa0;\u2026 We wish to continue our dialogue with the government of Ecuador. We believe that our two countries should be able to find a diplomatic solution. We have invited the government of Ecuador to resume, as early as possible, the discussions we have held on this matter to date.\"</p> <p>In his statement, Hague did not repeat his warning to Ecuador last month that Britain could invoke the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 to arrest Assange inside the embassy.</p> <p>Hague simply told MPs: \"Throughout our exchanges, we have noted that the rights of diplomatic missions conferred by the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations come with responsibilities. Article 41 of the Vienna convention sets out the obligations of diplomatic missions to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state \u2013 in this case the United Kingdom. These include the duty not to impede the due legal process of that state.\"</p>",
  "<p>Brendan Rodgers has decided against a remarkable return to Liverpool for Michael Owen despite a striker shortage that prompted John W Henry, the club's principal owner, to write an open letter to supporters that appears to condemn the manager's pursuit of Clint Dempsey.</p> <p>Liverpool's manager and owners are at odds over the failure to sign a replacement for Andy Carroll on transfer deadline day and Rodgers has considered the virtues of signing Owen, and other free agents, as back-up to Luis Su\u00e1rez and Fabio Borini, his only first team strikers until the window reopens in January. However, it is understood Owen's age \u2013 32 \u2013 fitness record and lack of regular football during three seasons with Manchester United have discouraged the Liverpool manager.</p> <p>Rodgers would rather promote a youngster from within the club's academy as cover for the next four months, despite the risks and pressure upon himself after Liverpool's worst start to a season since 1962, than take what he considers a retrograde step in signing a player who left Anfield eight years ago.</p> <p>The manager's stance coincided with Henry taking the unusual move of defending Fenway Sports Group's transfer dealings in an open letter to supporters. Henry and Liverpool's chairman, Tom Werner, have faced the most hostile criticism of their near-two year reign since failing to sign a striker on Friday. Rodgers had hoped to replace Carroll with Dempsey but FSG would not offer above \u00a34m for the 29-year-old, who ultimately joined Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a36m.</p> <p>Fulham claim Liverpool offered only \u00a33m for the USA attacker while a deal for Daniel Sturridge collapsed due to the striker's insistence on a permanent transfer. The Liverpool manager, who has claimed finances were a factor in Carroll's departure, wanted a loan move before committing to a permanent deal for the Chelsea striker. \"Spending is not merely about buying talent,\" Henry wrote. \"Our ambitions do not lie in cementing a mid-table place with expensive, short-term quick fixes that will only contribute for a couple of years.\"</p> <p>That comment reflects the rift that has developed between Liverpool's owner and manager in recent days, though Henry describes Rodgers as a \"talented young manager and we have valued highly his judgment about the make-up of the squad\". The former Swansea City manager was granted control of all football matters upon his arrival at Anfield in June, having resisted FSG's attempts to install a sporting director such as Louis van Gaal before accepting the job, and has found his judgment undermined on Dempsey.</p> <p>Having spent almost \u00a330m on new players this summer, albeit with almost \u00a310m recouped in sales and loan fees and with the Liverpool wage bill slashed under Rodgers, Henry defended FSG's overall work in the window. He said: \"I am as disappointed as anyone connected with Liverpool Football Club that we were unable to add further to our strike force in this summer transfer window, but that was not through any lack of desire or effort on the part of all of those involved. They pushed hard in the final days of the transfer window on a number of forward targets and it is unfortunate that on this occasion we were unable to conclude acceptable deals to bring those targets in. \u2026</p> <p>\"But a summer window which brought in three young, but significantly talented starters in Joe Allen, Nuri Sahin and Fabio Borini as well as two exciting young potential stars of the future \u2013 Samed Yesil and Oussama Assaidi \u2013 could hardly be deemed a failure as we build for the future. Nor should anyone minimise the importance of keeping our best players during this window. We successfully retained Daniel Agger, Martin Skrtel and Luis Su\u00e1rez.\"</p> <p>Henry reiterated claims that FSG are still dealing with the fallout from the near-ruinous Liverpool ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Joe Cole, handed a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract by the former Liverpool managing director Christian Purslow, remains on the club's books, for example. But he accepts that FSG has itself erred in the transfer market, sanctioning a \u00a3120m outlay on new players under the former manager Kenny Dalglish and the ex-director of football Damien Comolli only to sack Dalglish after one full season in charge.</p> <p>\"We are still in the process of reversing the errors of previous regimes,\" he adds. \"It will not happen overnight. It has been compounded by our own mistakes in a difficult first two years of ownership. It has been a harsh education, but make no mistake, the club is healthier today than when we took over.\"</p>",

  "<p>It is a decision one imagines the legendary Hollywood star might well have embraced: <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/appeals-court-rules-marilyn-monroes-image-public-estate-367160\" title=\"\">Marilyn Monroe, according to a new legal ruling, belongs to everybody</a>.</p> <p>A US federal court said on Thursday that Monroe's estate was wrong to pursue photo libraries and other organisations that use her image without permission or payment on T-shirts and other memorabilia. It all stems from a decision made almost half a century ago by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36223/some.like.it.hot\" title=\"\">Some Like It Hot</a> star's legal representatives in the wake of her 1962 death. Faced with a grand tax bill from the Californian authorities if they registered her final abode in the state, they chose to list the actor's official domicile as New York, where Monroe had a second home, because the latter did not charge estate taxes.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a move that saved Monroe's heirs millions of dollars at the time could now end up costing them far more. New York does not share California's generous laws regarding control of dead celebrities' images, and last week's hearing ruled in favour of those who believe the actor's estate has, for decades, been wrongly extracting a fee each time Monroe's image is used.</p> <p>The issue came to light when the estate took a number of photo libraries to court in the middle of the last decade for selling her image on without permission. Several courts, noting that Monroe's official final abode was New York, opted to abide by that state's statutes and threw out the cases. The legal battle continued up until last week's decision by the <a href=\"http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/\" title=\"\">federal ninth circuit court of appeals</a>, despite efforts by the state of California at one point to retrospectively award rights to the estate via a change in the law. That position now appears to have been reversed.</p> <p>\"This is a textbook case for applying judicial estoppel,\" wrote Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw in her ruling on Thursday. \"Monroe's representatives took one position on Monroe's domicile at death for 40 years, and then changed their position when it was to their great financial advantage; an advantage they secured years after Monroe's death by convincing the California legislature to create rights that did not exist when Monroe died. Marilyn Monroe is often quoted as saying, 'If you're going to be two-faced, at least make one of them pretty.'\"</p> <p>In a footnote to its ruling, the court pointed out that Monroe once foresaw the battle over rights to her image and its outcome. \"We observe that the lengthy dispute over the exploitation of Marilyn Monroe's persona has ended in exactly the way that Monroe herself predicted more that 50 years ago,\" <a href=\"http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/08/30/08-56471.pdf\" title=\"\">reads the judgment</a>. \"'I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.'\"</p>",

He's stepped off,\" said David Hopkins, university professor, Outward Bound trustee and international mountain guide waiting at the bottom to unhook the abseilers. \"That's the hard bit. Can you imagine how hyped he must be? He must be so in the zone.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395580248\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/3/1346673742858/Prince-Andrew-on-the-desc-009.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Andrew on the descent of the Shard\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Andrew on the descent. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the royal posterior edged closer and closer, another little black dot appeared above it. Ffion Hague, the trust's deputy chairman, in her own words \"not a sporty type\", was beginning her descent. \"God, she's brave,\" muttered a TV producer as the camera zoomed in and a media helicopter hovered alongside.</p> <p>And so it went throughout the day. John Caudwell, 59, possessed of a mobile phone fortune and a fear of heights, donned a Spider-Man outfit. Sir Chris Bonington, 78, conquerer of Everest and the Eiger, strolled it.</p> <p>In all some 20 were abseiling from the 87th floor to the 20th, while others were completing different stages.</p> <p>Some half-hour after setting off the duke made it to the 20th floor, his shoes squeaking audibly on the glass. \"I'm not even going to say that was a piece of cake,\" he said. \"I will never do it again.\"</p> <p>So had he been scared at all? \"I was scared at the top,\" he admitted, saying the morning mist had made the windows wet with condensation. \"I slipped the whole way down the first section.\"</p> <p>What did his parachuting mother think of it all? She had been \"entirely happy\" when he last spoke to her about it at Balmoral, he said.</p> <p>\"It's a long way down. But it's a fantastic view of London,\" added the former Royal Navy helicopter pilot, concluding: \"Yes, I feel very good. I think I'll go and have some breakfast now.\"</p> <p>The abseils were completed in three stages \u2013 a 32-metre descent, followed by a changeover of rope for the next 175 metres, and a second rope change for the final 32 metres. It could not be completed in one single abseil because a 300-metre rope was too heavy to carry.</p> <p>Each abseiler had two ropes, one to grip and another secured to their safety harness. Organisers insisted it was safe, with ropes attached to the superstructure of the building and the operation overseen by the Royal Marines. All of which did little to calm nerves.</p> <p>\"It was exhilarating and terrifying in about equal measure,\" said Hague, admitting \"my comfort zone is so far away just now I can't even see it\".</p> <p>She said: \"The thing you notice first is the silence. The sounds of the city are very distant. It's just you, a breath of wind, and it's very disconcerting to see the birds flying beneath you. Then, about half way down, the wind kicks in and you can hear the platform announcements from London Bridge station. That's very surreal.\"</p> <p>The hardest bit was \"coming off the edge, no doubt\".</p> <p>\"It's a very, very scary thing, but once I relaxed enough to control the rope properly, have a smooth glide, then I could have a look around. It was fabulous. I saw the Gherkin like a little spot in the far distance.\"</p> <p>Caudwell's descent was briefly interruped about 20 metres from the end for his family to take photographs. \"Stop there, stop there,\" shouted his son Jacobi, eight, leaving him hanging around the 25th floor mark. \"I just want to get down,\" his father shouted back.</p> <p>\"That was broadly terrifying, but sort of terrifying, fantasy fun,\" Caudwell said on completion. But it had done little for his vertigo. \"I think I'm even more scared. I think it was kill or cure and I don't think the cure's worked,\" he laughed. He was so nervous beforehand, he blocked it from his mind until the last possible moment. \"As we were driving here in the car, my lad said: 'Oh there it is, daddy. Right up there.' And I said: 'I don't want to know.'</p> <p>\"It's not till you get the gear on, it starts dawning on you what you've got to do.\"</p> <p>No such nerves for Bonington. \"It is a whole sight easier abseiling down glass than it is rock and snow with the wind whistling around your ears.\" he said.</p> <p>Details of how to sponsor participants can be found at <a href=\"http://www.descentoftheshard.com/\" title=\"\">www.descentoftheshard.com</a>.</p>",

I can clearly remember sitting in a maths lesson, reading whichever one I was most recently obsessed with under the desk, trying desperately to finish it before the end of the class because I'd promised I'd give it back to its owner (who hadn't read it and who was waiting crossly at the desk behind me).</p> <p>I was reminded of my fixation by the comments on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/30/sweet-valley-francine-pascal-interview\" title=\"\">my Sweet Valley High piece last week</a>: yes, lots of you were fans of the Wakefield twins too, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Horror\" title=\"\">Point Horror</a> and Pike were brought up again and again by readers. I did read Point Horror \u2013 The Lifeguard, The Baby Sitter, basically the RL Stine ones \u2013 but it was Pike who I loved.

I think I'm going to track down some of his 80s paperbacks which I so loved back in the day, and which I always had to snaffle from friends or borrow from the library rather than own.

  "<p>Hibu, the troubled publisher of the Yellow Pages, fell a precipitous 48% to 0.64p on Monday morning, on fears that shareholders will be wiped out if a group of banks take control of the company.</p> <p>The Sunday Times reported over the weekend that Hibu's creditors are on the brink of appointing US restructuring firm Houlihan Lokey to advise on a debt-for-equity swap. That would likely leave shareholders with very little value, which explains why the shares are now trading at less than 1p.</p> <p>On Monday, the company declined to comment but earlier this month it said it would form a committee of lenders \u2013 including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 to find a way of reducing the company's \u00a32.2bn pile. Then last Friday, Hibu said the lenders had granted the company a waiver that would prevent any breaches of its lending covenants.</p> <p>Previously known as Yell Group, Hibu changed its name in July in an attempt to reinvent itself as a digital services provider. But the company continues to groan under the weight of its debt, which is more than 100 times its market value. Much of the debt was amassed during an ill-advised shopping spree, which saw Hibu buy up rivals in Spain, America and parts of Latin America in order to expand its global footprint.</p> <p>Now Hibu is being forced to write down the value of many of these acquisitions, resulting in a \u00a31.2bn loss in the year to March. Although the Yellow Pages itself still makes profits of about \u00a3300m a year before interest payments, they are declining by about 20% a year, as consumers increasingly turn to the internet to find local services and phone numbers.</p> <p>Last year, chief executive Mike Pocock and finance director Tony Bates were brought in to turn the business around and sort out the company's debt. Hibu's workforce of some 13,000 people will be hoping they succeed.</p>",
  "<p>The Andy Roddick story refuses to quit. In another hugely entertaining piece of high theatre, the fiery-eyed American won through to the quarter-finals by beating the affable Italian Fabio Fognini and declared: \"This whole process, I'm not trying to over-think it. I'm enjoying it.\"</p> <p>He revealed his dodgy serving shoulder gave him trouble when he got out of bed in the morning but not even that can make Mr Grumpy frown. \"It's not great But it's good enough. I got max a week of tennis left, so it's good enough for that.\"</p> <p>This is a man who seems more comfortable with his surroundings on the eve of leaving the sport than he ever did when in his pomp. The snarl is gone. He even smiled when he won. He nearly cried. In fact, he probably did cry. Andy Roddick is letting the facade drop and it's not a bad look.</p> <p>Fognini gave him a decent workout, but now Roddick's got Juan Martin del Potro, who won here in 2009. From here, it gets serious.</p> <p>If, against all odds, he carries the dream to its logical conclusion (logical to Roddick, that is), he will have a few friends to thank.</p> <p>\"I'm comfortable out there,\" he said. \"I'd be an idiot not to use the crowd right now. It's a huge advantage. Each match is almost like it's another memory. I'm certainly going to use them.</p> <p>\"It was loud out there, about as loud as I remember. They definitely established themselves out there. It was a lot of fun.\"</p> <h2>Memories of Jimbo</h2> <p>If you admire what Roddick is doing at the US Open, just turned 30 and already officially retired, think back to the deeds of Jimmy Connors, from the start to the finish of his remarkable career.</p> <p>It is 42 years to the day since Connors, full of bristling energy under that distinctive mop, shoulders hunched, eyes on fire and wearing those ridiculously tight shorts, barrelled into New York for the first time, on his 18th birthday. When Britain's Mark Cox dumped him out in the first round who, except the man himself, could be sure he would be around for a long time after that?</p> <p>Fast-forward to 1991, when Jimbo gatecrashed his favourite tournament again after recovering from a bad wrist injury. He was ranked 194 in the world and given no hope of surviving more than a match or two, but he came back from two sets and 0-3 in the third to beat Patrick McEnroe in the first round, then swept aside Michiel Schapers and the tenth seed Karel Novacek to reach the final 16. There, on his 39th birthday, exactly 21 years since Cox beat him in the first round, he met 24-year-old Aaron Krickstein and, over four hours and 41 minutes, won a memorable five-setter to reach the quarter-finals. A few days later, he did this against the Dutchman Paul Haarhuis in one of the sport's great rallies:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9AuBGmLw1ZY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9AuBGmLw1ZY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>..<br>Connors won in four sets but had nothing left against Jim<br>Courier in the semis and the amazing journey was over. But it was some<br>trip. Nobody worked a crowd like Jimmy Connors \u2013 not even Roddick.</p> <h2>In the swim</h2> <p>Sam Smith, British No 1 for three years in the late Nineties, has plenty of good memories \u2013 and she left this tournament with another. Now commentating astutely for Sky, she said on air she would swim in the fountain outside the venue if Laura Robson won three matches here.</p> <p>When Robson duly delivered, becoming the first British player to reach the fourth round of a major since Smith in 1998, Sam was determined to pay her forfeit. With the media in tow, she was thwarted by local officials who said she did not have the necessary permit for such activity \u2013 but, we can reveal, she sneaked back later and the deed was done.</p> <p>Had Laura beaten Stosur, next on the starting blocks was Annabel Croft</p> <h2>See ya later, Lleyton?</h2> <p>The little Aussie battler, Lleyton Hewitt, went down fighting (he knows no other way) but gave not indication of following Roddick into retirement after his four-set loss to the fourth seed David Ferrer.</p> <p>How much does he love tennis? Check <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/my-new-left-foot-lleyton-hewitts-radical-surgery-revealed/story-fnbe6xeb-1226367415352\">this on how he is now playing with a bionic toe, but risked never being able to play again with radical surgery</a>.</p> <p>He said on his way out he will play the Davis Cup in Germany in a fortnight and four more tournaments this year, but there was no mention of the R word.</p> <p>He's done a complete round of majors this year on wild cards and, no doubt, will get another one at home in Melbourne in January. How long can he rely on the goodwill of tournament organisers? It won't do the ratings any harm. He is, after all, eight years younger than Connors was in that epic 1991 campaign at Flushing Meadows.</p> <h2>Standing your ground</h2> <p>Fans of confrontational tennis might like to catch the fourth-round contest on Monday between Tomas Berdych and Nicolas Almagro, first up in the Louis Armstrong Stadium.</p> <p>They clashed famously at the Australian Open when the Spaniard banged a volley directly at Berdych, who did not take kindly to this breach of tennis etiquette and refused to shake hands with his opponent at the end of the match.</p> <p>To my mind, the greater crime was Berdych's. For a start, the custom of refusing to physically inconvenience an opponent, to the detriment of your own point-scoring chances, has always seemed daft. Second, he should have had the good grace to accept the apology Almagro proffered.</p> <p>That said, Berdych, 50-1 before this tournament, might be worth watching in the second week.</p>",
  "<p>News about Peter Jackson's ever-expanding Hobbit project continues to appear. Last month he announced that \"the richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins,\" by translating it into three movies. Over the weekend, Warner Bros confirmed that the three films will be titled An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again.</p> <p>The Hobbit is a shorter book than even The Fellowship of the Ring alone, and it tells a pretty snappy story, with a more upbeat, playful tone than The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is debatable whether the novel could reasonably be stretched to two films, and so responses to the news that it will now be stretched much further are pretty mixed. Some fans are glad at the project of more time spent in Middle Earth, and are pleased to hear that Jackson will incorporate material from the appendices to LOTR. Others are not so glad, and you can read fan responses on Jackson's Facebook page, as well as on a whole bunch of other movie sites.</p> <p>The critique is pretty simple \u2013 Jackson and his team are stretching a simple story beyond reasonable limits to make more money from ticket sales. Harry Potter was the first franchise to split books, turning the Deathly Hallows into two separate movies. Although there was some creative rationale for the split \u2013 Deathly Hallows was a long book, and it meant we got two tonally distinct movies \u2013 it's also true Warner Bros probably increased its grosses by many hundreds of millions in the process. Other franchises, including Twilight and The Hunger Games, have since followed suit. Jackson, though, seems to be taking this idea to extremes, and many fans are up in arms at what they see as a blatant cash grab.</p> <p>I'm not sure I agree this will be a total bust: I generally like my blockbusters slow and introspective, so this change may work for me as a viewer. I'm also not sure money is the only factor. In fact, I think something much more dispiriting has motivated the decision: creative stagnation.</p> <p>Jackson started out as a director of low-budget horror movies in New Zealand. Although he came to Hollywood in the late 1990s, he had never had any major hits, and his background meant he was an unusual figure to take on a property as big as LOTR. But Warner Bros and New Line took a chance on him, and were rewarded with a remarkably successful series of films \u2013 successful at the box office, but also successful as creatively daring and accomplished movies.</p> <p>Since then, though, Jackson has struggled to recreate the success. His long-gestating King Kong made money, but was also bloated and oddly shoddy (for example, the original soundtrack was dumped weeks before release, and a bland generic score took its place, which undercut many of the film's intended emotional beats). The Lovely Bones has its supporters, but it was a critical and commercial failure.</p> <p>Jackson continued to work as a producer, and following a protracted battle for the rights, he had hoped to oversee The Hobbit in that position. When Guillermo del Toro dropped out, Jackson took the director's chair, and we end up back where we were 10 years ago \u2013 with one key difference. When Jackson took on LOTR, he was an ambitious outsider with a daring project. Now he is an established director on his uppers, revisiting past glories in lieu of anything better to do. Directing The Hobbit is arguably a sign that Jackson is out of ideas. His other projects haven't quite delivered in various ways, and so he has returned to terrain he covered successfully back in the day.</p> <p>It's hard to see how making The Hobbit could be considered a positive step for Jackson. However, splitting the story into three separate films takes the moribund self-absorption of the project to entirely new levels. It looks as if Jackson is running entirely on empty, pushing this side project to ridiculous extremes because he has nothing else to offer.</p> <p>Who knows, the movie(s) might be good, and I might have to eat my words. While it may be maddening for those who see cold, hard profit as the prime motivation behind The Hobbit, it looks sad rather than venal to me. Jackson used to be a genuinely capable and interesting figure, with a particular talent for pioneering technical accomplishments (his decision to film in 48fps is the most compelling thing about The Hobbit). It sounds crazy to say, in light of the visionary epic fantasies he has created, but surely he could choose more creatively ambitious projects than this. Tolkien seems to have created the idealised past of Middle Earth in order to escape a confusing present. It's a shame to see Jackson doing the same.</p>",
  "<p>On Exmouth Market in central London, there is a blue tent by the side of the road. Look closer and you will see that the side of the tent is daubed with the words \"Jesus, help me\". Crowds bustle by on their way to and from work. But if you stuck your head inside, you would be greeted by the earnest face of Abdul Rahim Dehdozorgi.</p> <p>Dehdozorgi has not eaten for more than 30 days. He is hungry. His movements are slow and deliberate. If you doubt his resolve, then look closely at his lips. They are sewn together with fishing wire.</p> <p>Dehdozorgi's hunger strike is in support of his old pastor in Iran, an evangelical named Youcef Nadarkhani who was condemned to death by hanging in 2010. His crime? Apostasy \u2013 leaving the religion of Islam for another.</p> <p>Christianity is protected by Islamic law, and even though apostasy is a crime in sharia, it is not actually illegal in Iran. However, it can be punished by a court of law under the auspices of upholding a religious ruling.</p> <p>Nadarkhani argued in his trial that he had never been a Muslim, and thus could not be an apostate. The fact is that practising Christianity, especially international Protestantism, is often viewed as seditious in Iran. Proselytising for a religion that holds so much sway in the west is perhaps akin to advertising communist meetings in McCarthy-era America.</p> <p>Nadarkhani was held for four years in a notorious jail for political prisoners. He was given many chances to renounce his faith, but he steadfastly refused. Dehdozorgi described Nadarkhani's house church to me, the joy he had found there, and the persecution they faced. He claimed he could no longer practise Christianity safely in Iran.</p> <p>The form of Christianity to which Nadarkhani converted Dehdozorgi is not uncontroversial. The \"Jesus Only\" movement, that rejects the notion of the trinity for a unified theology of Christ, is seen as a cult by many other Christians. Even Iranian Christian news agency Mohabat News published an article complaining that \"the cult has caused untold damage to the cause of the gospel in Iran\".</p> <p>Whether his interpretation of Christ is orthodox or heretical, Dehdozorgi is clearly prepared to sacrifice the only thing he has left, his life, for his God. It is faith that made Dehdozorgi brave, but it is the British Home Office that has ensured he has nothing to lose. He is seeking asylum here and in the UK it is illegal for asylum seekers to work while their cases are being processed. Perhaps it is hoped that destitution will convince refugees to go home. Many, like Dehdozorgi, are simply unable to go home. He was living on the streets for more than three years before he began his hunger strike.</p> <p>The story has a precedent. In 2011 two Iranian brothers sat in a tent in central London and declared a hunger strike, sewing their lips together to display their resolve. They were in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/21/iranian-hunger-stikers-sew-lips-uk-deportation\" title=\"\">national papers</a> and on television after a week.</p> <p>Dehdozorgi, however, has been largely ignored by the papers. Why? I could offer a tentative answer: the 2011 strike was secular, squarely aimed at the Border Agency. Dehdozorgi's protest is clearly religious. Many people will read the religious symbolism on the side of his tent as a mark of insanity.</p> <p>The intensity that the story of a 2,000-year-old execution arouses in people like Dehdozorgi is interpreted by some as dangerous irrationality. Even to those of us who disagree, Dehdozorgi's striking bravery is disturbing; perhaps he is determined to martyr himself here, as London grinds past without a second glance.</p> <p>Passers by quicken their pace in the effort to scrub his mournful image from their field of vision. The Iranian government is likely to do the same. Dehdozorgi's eyes are glazed with tiredness, but he is determined. He is prepared to die fighting this small battle for religious freedom in his country, whether this world pays him any mind or not.</p>",
  "<p>Alongside Bioshock, Borderlands is the most interesting, multifaceted shooter of the last decade. It's not just the cunning mix of gameplay components \u2013 the incendiary FPS thrills of Halo, the joyous loot-grabbing of Diablo \u2013 it's the way in which it constructs a world that is at once fanciful and alien, but also hugely redolent of our own. As Christian Donlan put it so eloquently in <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-05-borderlands-2-preview-the-right-to-bear-arms\">his Borderlands 2 preview</a> for Eurogamer, Borderlands wasn't just made in America, it <em>is</em> America, with its vast open spaces, its factionalism, its love of fine weaponry. Borderlands is funny but it means something. </p> <p>And in the forthcoming sequel, where players once again become scavengers looking for treasures on the wasteland planet of Pandora, there is a renewed sense of anti-establishment satire. The antagonist is Handsome Jack, the CEO of the evil Hyperion Corporation, looking to clean out this dustball of all its weird clans and bandits. With your improvised weapons and lawless communities, you're the Old West, standing in the way of the railroad of capitalist progress. </p> <p>But yeah, it's also funny, and Handsome Jack has been designed more for humour than to provide some sort of evil nemesis in the traditional gaming mould. </p> <p>\"Ahhh, can't we just have fun?!\" groans Gearbox co-founder Brian Martel, exactly on cue. </p> <p>We're sitting in a tiny meeting room in the business centre at Gamescom and the conversation has turned to the other shooters that were around at the time Borderlands was released; all those earnest military blasters with their cardboard cutout spec ops soldiers and dead-eyed patriotic fervour. </p> <p>\"Games can be so serious, whether it's about soldiers in the Middle East or some megalomaniacal guy trying to take over Earth,\" he continues. \"We've all played through those scenarios so many times! That's one of the fun things about Borderlands: the guys making the game are having as much fun as the players. And it's different every time \u2013 we haven't seen all the weapons in the game, it's impossible. It's almost like a hobby \u2013 it's what games should be\". </p> <p>Weapons are the engine of the Borderlands experience. As in the first title, players will be able to pick up modular guns constructed from a series of random parts, all with different specs. The thousands of possible firearms should end up suiting every individual playing style. </p> <p>There are several fictional manufacturers in the game, each with its own identity, marketing and approach to design. While Vladof promotes its Kalashnikov-style high-fire-rate sub-machine guns with revolutionary zeal, Maliwan pushes its high-tech blasters as artworks in the gallery of war. Gearbox has even produced promotional videos for all the weaponry \u2013 you can find them all on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/2KGames\">2K Games' YouTube page</a>, and they're worth a look, if only for the ridiculous care and detail that's gone in to them. </p> <p>This is all both functional and an intrinsic element of the game's satirical approach. The guns are corporate culture exerting itself on the people, right? \"Yes, that's part of it,\" says Martel. \"I refer to our designer, Matt Armstrong, as the head of the weapons division at Gearbox. In the first game we didn't quite get the identity right with the manufacturers; this time we wanted to create a more compelling sense of brand affinity. You get people who love their Nikes and others who say, 'I love Adidas!' - there's that rivalry. We see it with Apple and Android - I saw someone the other day who had a sticker on their car of an Android eating an Apple. </p> <p>\"Matt wanted to get that with these gun manufacturers. He wanted gamers to get to the point where they'd go and buy a T-shirt that said Maliwan on it. I think he's done a pretty good job of that. And then Kevin Duke, who was core in the conceptualisation this time round for the weapons, really took that to heart. He and the art director Jeremy Cook really worked to ensure that when you saw a weapon lying on the ground you'd know the manufacturer, you'd know it was a Jakobs\". </p> <p>Cleverly though, Gearbox is also messing with that whole idea of brand loyalty. \"Yes, Matt wanted to make it so that underlying in the design, you'd sometimes need a gun that you didn't care about to beat certain creatures,\" says Martel. They're challenging you: brand vs gameplay \u2013 which will win out when it comes to the crunch?</p> <p>So the guns explore brand evangelism, but also the corporate machinery behind it. \"What was cool to me is that the team was really determined to make that a pervasive element,\" says Anthony Burch, who joined Gearbox as a writer in 2010 after Randy Pitchford became a fan of his hilarious web series, <a href=\"http://www.heyash.com/\">Hey Ash, Watcha Playing</a>. \"It wasn't just like, we'll have a couple of funny commercials \u2013 no, all the guns are going to look and feel different and embody different gun fantasies, for want of a better phrase. As a consequence, you get that it's a dystopian game \u2013 even in the farthest outer wastelands you can't escape corporations, they're still the ones running the show and they don't necessarily have your best interest at heart. </p> <p>\"There great some great moments when I was writing commercials for different gun manufacturers and we'd have conversations like, 'okay, which of these corporations would sell me out and kill me if there was profit in it?' And we came to the conclusion that they'd all sell me out, it was just a question of who would do it quickest. None of them are good, you can't side with corporations. It's that idea of keeping everything dark and harsh and a little bit on the edge.\"</p> <p>This sense of authenticity, of a functioning logical world, exists throughout the game \u2013 even to the point where the team has invented technologies to explain genre conventions \u2013 like the enormous inventories characters carry around and re-spawning when players die. </p> <p>\"We wanted to turn the mechanics and paradigms within the genre into things that felt correct for science fiction,\" says Martel. \"And one thing that's under-appreciated about Borderlands is the bits of sci-fi we've done. For example, our concept of digistructing [a technology that allows items to materialise from digital blueprints] - that came out of the fact that the characters can't possibly hold all the guns they're carrying; I mean, where do they go? So we had this idea of an infinite storage deck represented by the holsters - when the character reaches for it, the gun creates in their hands. And that ties into the New You stations, which recreate you at the spot where you die. We were also consistent with the creature design: we asked, what is the commonality between them? So they all have this sideways mouth thing. It all feeds into the game\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395582800\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346421695931/bl2_1.jpg\" alt=\"Borderlands 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For Burch, what's important is that the humour \u2013 like the corporate messaging \u2013 is a pervasive part of the experience. It's not just the odd daft piece of throwaway dialogue, or a funny new enemy. It's in everything. \"What's cool about how we've designed the gags in the game is that they inhabit more than just one part,\" says Burch. \"There are a lot of funny lines, but there are also quests that are <em>about</em> comedy, delivered through gameplay or structure. We'll take what you expect will be a two-hour quest with lots of interesting gameplay, and make it a five-minute quest with no interesting gameplay just to screw with your expectations. </p> <p>\"And the ideas can come from anywhere. We have a designer who said to me, 'I really like Top Gun, can we have a quest that's just about Top Gun?', I was like, 'What?! Yes! Why would I ever say no to that!?'\" So there's a homoerotic topless volleyball sequence in Borderlands 2? \"Yes,\" replies Burch. \"Yes, we have that. I'd like to say we're the first non-Dead or Alive game to have a topless volleyball scene\". A noble aim.</p> <p>After two years at Gearbox, Burch says that he's learned a lot about humour in games. \"Yeah, in a weird way I appreciate how difficult it is, but at the same time \u2013 and this is going to sound stupid \u2013 I think it's easier than a lot of people make it out to be. You can count the number of funny games on one hand, but what's really interesting about that is, in most games, the gameplay itself does tend to be funny; it doesn't take itself seriously. Sure you have games like Shadows of the Colossus and Bioshock that are about big moral choices, and the mechanics reflect that, but for a vast majority of the time, you have games that are just, 'blow up all these heads and get experience points!', which is inherently not serious, it is funny. </p> <p>\"I felt very blessed to work on a game like Borderlands that embraces all that \u2013 that understands it's all about shooting psycho dwarves in the face with guns that fire lightning. It understands that this is the charm of the game and doesn't shy away from having its tone and narrative reflect that\". </p> <p>Key to the successful implementation of humour into Borderlands is the team approach; the fact that every element of the game serves a common purpose. \"Any schmo can write a joke, but 90% of the joke is in the delivery; that goes double for games,\" says Burch. \"What I found really amazing is that, if any of my jokes work at all, it's because the designers are so damn good at what they do \u2013 they'll find the exact spot where the combat has just ended and there's a lull, and they'll make sure the punchline happens when it doesn't screw anything else up or occlude any of the other dialogue. Or if we're going to play around with the mechanics like having a gun that fires something funny, it has to have some gameplay value. It's a game above everything else, you have to find ways to implement humour without compromising the fun of the game.\"</p> <p>But timing is almost impossible in games, isn't it? You never know what a player is going to do next. \"That's totally true,\" says Burch. \" And we knew that if you're going along a path through this map in a reasonable way trying to follow objectives then we can put a comic moment in there\u2026 but there's truly nothing stopping you from going, 'ah fuck it, I'm leaving', and while we had a set up for a joke right here and assumed that five seconds later the pay off would play, you could just say, 'nope' and go, and you come back an hour later and you've forgotten the set-up. We're like, alright, that happens, it's a bummer \u2013 but we'll just throw a whole bunch more jokes at you\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395582801\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346421919023/Screen_Shot_2012-08-31_at_15.02.23.png\" alt=\"Borderlands 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At the same time, there is that underlying darkness. Pandora is a nightmarish hellhole, where everything in the environment \u2013 the plants, the animals, the locals, they all want to kill you; its mutated clans and bandit groups are the stuff of rural horror \u2013 the unknowable psychopaths of The Hills Have Eyes and Deliverance. </p> <p>\"When I came on to the team, I knew the games, but I wasn't one of the people who helped build the world or understood the tone,\" says Burch. \"So one of the things that Jeremy Cook, the art director, made sure I knew, even as we expanded the Borderlands universe, was that any goofy wacky moments should still be anchored in something more serious, or more meaningful. For example, Tiny Tina, this wacky crazy character, has a really sad backstory. There's a bunch of stuff about Handsome Jack that's really goofy and OTT, but he does some very dark stuff. </p> <p>\"Thematically, a lot of the things we play with are like the song from the first game, No Rest for the Wicked \u2013 well, <em>the player</em> is the wicked one, it's not something you're used to being called \u2013 usually you're the hero of light who saves us all! </p> <p>Handsome Jack refers to himself as the hero and you as the bad guy and we play around with that a lot \u2013 but in a tongue in cheek way. We don't actually want you to be thinking, 'oh God, it's so awful I killed all those midgets' No, it's fine they were throwing grenades at you. One of the things we made sure to do at the beginning of the game was, you're going along with Claptrap, fighting a bunch of bandits and when you kill them all your character says, 'What have we done?! These were people with lives, with families! ... Nah, I'm just fucking with you, screw those guys!' It puts you into the right frame of mind: this a game where those things don't matter, where you don't feel guilty. Even if it doesn't resonate as a theme or a philosophical point in itself, it's useful as a counterpoint. You need the straight man in a comedy routine \u2013 it gives you a license to be goofy\". </p> <p>Which brings us back to Handsome Jack, the lynchpin in the Borderlands 2 story. The key to him is, he isn't a standard video megalomaniac \u2013 he's a child. A gamer. \"Initially he was a rival vault hunter,\" says Burch. \"It was you and him basically racing to the treasure \u2013 like Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Ark. We knew from the very beginning we wanted a strong villain, we're super into Portal, Bioshock, System Shock \u2013 all those games have really strong antagonists that propel you through the narrative. </p> <p>\"But he went through a bunch of iterations. Next he was going to be the owner of an evil gladiatorial arena, and then eventually we decided on the head of Hyperion. I'm really curious to see how people react, he's a very unusual villain, he's a very immature guy. I wrote him as a 16-year-old GTA freak who has got to 99% completion and is almost at 100% and the fact he can't find that last item is pissing him off! He's a kooky guy.\" </p> <p>And later, I'm talking to Brian Martel about the humour, the way the team seems to enjoy pushing it, and the way the game's audience laps it all up. It is an interesting community. And Borderlands is all that's great, all that's creative and cathartic about games and game design. Did they plan for that? Did they know we'd get it? </p> <p>\"In many ways, Borderlands is an indie game that got lucky,\" he shrugs. \"It's like that indie band that you love and you're both pleased that they're successful, but also thinking, hey, that's mine. We can't believe people love this as much as we do \u2013 but, in the end, maybe that passion comes through\u2026\"</p> <p><em>Borderlands 2 is released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 21 September</em></p>",
  "<p>There are some dramatic fallers among the small-caps this morning, while the markets themselves are slightly up.</p> <p>Phoenix IT plunged 34% to 139p after the cloud computing services provider said it had uncovered accounting irregularities over a number of accounting periods.</p> <p>The company said it appears that certain control processes in the finance division at its Servo site in Leeds have been \"repeatedly and deliberately circumvented\".

  "<h2>1. Don't ignore it<br></h2> <p>Forecasting can seem quite an easy thing to put off, or indeed not do at all. In an economic downturn, just keeping afloat takes up enough energy. However, it is critical to know what's coming around the corner says Rodney Schwartz, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.clearlyso.com/\" title=\"\">ClearlySo</a>, the organisation that helps social entrepreneurs: \"A lack of a cashflow forecast is a recipe for certain disaster \u2013 whatever the long-term prospects, they mean zero the day the firm runs out of cash.\" Without a rigorous set of projections, says Schwartz, \"a strategy is just a bunch of words\".</p> <h2>2. Know what you're doing</h2> <p>Start with the basics, suggests Stuart Crook, <a href=\"http://www.wellersaccountants.co.uk/about-us/partner-profiles\" title=\"\">partner at Wellers accountants</a> in Oxfordshire: \"The business plan is the common sense side: does our idea make sense? Where do we sit in the market? Forecasting is how to deal with cashflow, VAT, PAYE etc. You may see X thousand in your bank account and think you're OK, but if you take into account the fact that VAT is paid quarterly, suddenly the cash balance looks a hell of a lot worse. All those things need to be in the forecast.\"</p> <h2>3. Know your audience<br></h2> <p>While forecasting should be done as standard practice, sometimes it is also necessary for specific reasons such as raising finance from the bank or from external investors. \"The underlying process [of forecasting] is the same, but the communication is different depending on the audience\", says Rachel Carrell, CEO of<a href=\"https://www.drthom.com/\" title=\"\"> DrThom</a>, a small business of around 20 employees. The company was founded in 2002 to help people unable to visit their doctor.</p> <p>\"We don't change assumptions based on the audience,\" Carrell adds. \"But sometimes we do need to categorise things differently. One group recently wanted to understand how our asthma service was going to develop, for example, so we needed to pull that out of the overall numbers and list it separately.\"</p> <h2>4. Know your market<br></h2> <p>Forecasting isn't based on your business performance and predicted performance alone, but also that of the market around you. You need to know your customer base and competition, inside out. <a href=\"http://www.matrixsee.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Matrix</a> was founded in 2003 as a startup, and has since grown to become a leading supplier of energy management services.</p> <p>Simon Oldfield, finance director at Matrix, explains that to \"enable us to build long-term trust and relationships with our customers and financial backers, it has been essential for us to articulate a clear vision of how we expect the market for energy management services to develop ... this has involved extensive research, business planning and financial forecasting, all of which needs to be kept up-to-date.\"</p> <h2>5. Be flexible <br></h2> <p>While forecasting is difficult in the best of times, these are not the best of times. Oldfield informs that in energy management, \"we've noticed many companies have delayed decision-making because they're uncertain about the future and this has, at times, made it difficult to predict exactly when orders are going to be placed and contracts signed.\"</p> <p>In other words, there needs to be flexibility built into any business forecast. And while large businesses talk of five, 10 or even 20-year business plans, Crook argues these are less useful for small businesses. \"The further ahead that you forecast the less meaningful it is in my opinion ... in the real world, some people pay on 30 days and some at 90, and the forecast will need amending every week/month.\"</p> <h2>6. Use all the tools at your disposal<br></h2> <p>There are specific types of business forecasting software available, such as Sage. But most small businesses tend to stick with programmes they know, such as Excel. Rodney Schwartz at ClearlySo advises: \"The simpler the better \u2013 one of the best is just a projection of the bank balance; this is a basic tool in cashflow forecasting.\"</p> <p>Oldfield explains that Matrix's business forecast \"is supplemented by a variety of short-term tools, including an annual budget, individual sales targets and monthly re-forecasts of revenue and cashflow ... We've also introduced business routines whereby staff take individual responsibility for planning and forecasting and monitor actual performance against what was predicted.\"</p> <h2>7. Be realistic<br></h2> <p>When forecasting, especially for the benefit of an external investor, there is a natural tendency towards optimism. Be wary of that, says Mike Cherry, policy chairman at the <a href=\"http://www.fsb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Federation of Small Businesses</a>. \"You need to forecast not just the expectations of the best scenario but also the worst scenario if sales go through the floor. People often over-egg it for external investment ... [but] being realistic about what your aspirations are is pretty fundamental to getting their support. They will certainly be able to see through anyone who is over-optimistic or the if figures don't stack up.\"</p> <h2>8. Control your credit<br></h2> <p>Rachel Carrell at DrThom says: \"Poor credit control can throw your forecasts off dramatically. As the business grows, you can deal with small 'lumps' as they are naturally smoothed over by the sheer scale of the business. Big lumps remain a problem!\"</p> <p>It's one of the biggest issues that Crook finds clients struggling with: \"If a supplier has got poor credit controls then they won't chase you, won't threaten with legal letters or charge you interest. People pay those that shout the loudest because they don't want their credit rating to be hurt.\" Make sure you shout the loudest when it comes to money owed to you. And keep close contact with your own credit rating too, as the reverse also applies.</p> <h2>9. Know your interest rates<br></h2> <p>Small businesses need to keep abreast of the various interests rates they pay, and forecast accordingly. \"Businesses will typically have an overdraft, a loan, some hire purchase on equipment, but they don't necessarily compare the interest rates they have\", says Crook. \"When you have funds, you need to look at where it's best to apply those funds, and what's the cheapest way of doing it.\"</p> <p>One strategy can be to offer cashback or a discount to clients who pay invoices on or before time, suggests Crook. \"If you get your money in quicker then you're not incurring the overdraft interest rate \u2013 it might make strategic sense to offer that discount.\"</p> <h2>10. Don't get too obsessed<br></h2> <p>Despite the importance of forecasting, don't forget that the most important thing is actually running your business well. When asked if the best businesses are always the best forecasters, Mike Cherry says not necessarily: \"I think the best businesses are very much focused around their teams and getting the right product to the right customers on time. At the end of the day it comes down to value and service \u2013 those are the two keys to success, rather than cost per say. Be customer-focused all the time and don't let your eye off the ball.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>A Gaza man has died after setting himself alight, apparently in protest over his family's dire living conditions.</p> <p>Mohamed Abu Nada, 20, died on Sunday from injuries sustained a few days earlier when he poured petrol over his body at the morgue of Gaza City's Shifa hospital and set himself alight.</p> <p>His father told reporters in Gaza that his son wanted to draw attention to the family's poverty. \"I asked my son to go and look for a job, because I don't have a job and we don't have any source for living,\" said Abu Mohamed Abu Nada.</p> <p>Father and son reportedly argued before the incident.</p> <p>The family live in al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City. Two-thirds of Gazan families became refugees in 1948 and they are generally among the poorest in Gaza.</p> <p>\"This case illustrates so tragically the wider sense of desperation which the blockade has engendered,\" said Chris Gunness, spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. \"The humanitarian situation in Gaza is becoming increasingly dire, with the prospects of a prosperous and dignified life dwindling with every day.\"</p> <p>Hamdi Shaqqura of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said the news of the young man's suicide did not come as a shock. \"It is not the first time. In the past there have been several suicides for the reason of economic hardship,\" he said. \"The ongoing chronic closure imposed on the Gaza Strip has had a devastating impact on all aspects of life.\"</p> <p>The situation was particularly hard for young people, said Shaqqura. \"There are thousands and thousands of new graduates in the streets with no hope of finding a job, no hope of travelling abroad and no hope of building careers and lives.\"</p> <p>The unemployment rate in Gaza is 29%, and rises to 58% among young people aged between 20 and 24, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Eight out of 10 households are dependent on some kind of aid, and 39% of the 1.6-million-strong population live below the poverty line.</p> <p>Overcrowding, lengthy and frequent power cuts, unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation and inadequate medical care are features of daily life in Gaza for much of the population.</p> <p>A UN report released last month forecast a rise in the population to 2.1 million by 2020. \"The substantial population growth will thus add some 500,000 people to a living area which is restricted and already heavily urbanised,\" said the report, <a href=\"http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=1423\" title=\"\">Gaza in 2020 \u2013 A Liveable Place?</a> \"The challenges which confront the people of Gaza now will only intensify over the coming years.\"</p> <p>Israel enforced a tight blockade of Gaza for four years after Hamas took control of the area in June 2006, banning most imports, exports and the movement of people. Although it eased the blockade in 2010, there are still heavy restrictions on importing construction materials, exporting almost all goods and the issuing of permits to leave Gaza via Israel.</p> <p>Suicide, which is forbidden under Islam, is rare in Gaza despite operations by suicide bombers during the second intifada.</p>",
  "<p>Robin van Persie apologised for his fluffed penalty against Southampton but his dramatic late goals that completed a hat-trick made amends, as Manchester United came back to record a dramatic 3-2 win.</p> <p>In the 67th minute, with United trailing 2-1, Van Persie tried to be too clever with a chipped kick from the spot and the Southampton goalkeeper Kelvin Davis saved it. But the Holland striker, who had scored United's first equaliser in the 23rd minute, converted from close range on 88 minutes before he headed the winner in the second minute of injury time.</p> <p>\"I don't know what I was thinking with the penalty,\" Van Persie said. \"I wanted to hit it hard like I always do. At the last second, I just changed somehow, maybe it was my brother or something. It wasn't good enough. It was a bit of a down and then afterwards, we were a bit lucky with the 2-2 and then at the end, a dramatic 3-2.</p> <p>\"I'm quite disappointed about the penalty. I ask a certain standard from my game. When you are 2-1 down, you can't take a penalty like that. It is me to blame. I don't know what went wrong, something went wrong big time and I'll have to work on it.\"</p> <p>Van Persie's hat-trick took him to 100 Premier League goals as Sir Alex Ferguson reached 1,000 league games on his managerial watch at United. Van Persie did not accept that he had saved his new team and he singled out the substitute Paul Scholes for special praise.</p> <p>\"I have to say a big thank-you to Paul Scholes, when he came on everything was ticking,\" Van Persie said. \"Every single pass he hit was the right one. Everyone felt that, I certainly did. For me, he is the man of the match.\"</p> <p>Ferguson agreed. \"I thought when Paul Scholes came on, it changed the game completely,\" he said. \"I thought we were well out of it until Scholes came on. His vision and consistency of passing gave us complete control again.</p> <p>\"It was a matter of scoring the goals and Robin van Persie has come up with two very important goals. I was surprised [about the penalty] because every time I have seen him take one, he has rattled it in the corners. He made up for it though. He has four goals in two starts and that's a great statistic. And he'll get better.\"</p>",
  "<p>The biggest argument against the idea that the Xbox 360's hardcore audience will take to Kinect games \u2013 at least on this generation of consoles \u2013 is the lack of precise control it offers. Kinect is, in a word, flaky, and ultimately an absolute anathema to core players who demand tight controls and a lethal degree of accuracy in the games they're prepared to invest in.</p> <p>Iron Galaxy's Wreckateer does its best to sidestep this problem by playing up to Kinect's weaknesses. This is essentially a shooting game in which an inaccurate shot needn't necessarily spell doom for the player, since they can control their projectile to some degree once they've fired it. It's also impossible to judge a shot's impact on its target ahead of time, but we'll get to that in a moment.</p> <p>Wreckateer is an easy enough pitch to get your head around: in essence, it's Angry Birds in 3D. Except instead of firing a variety of birds at little green pigs in structures made out planks of wood and concrete, players fire a selection of projectiles out of a ballista at little green goblins in castles. The object of the game is to reduce as much of the buildings to piles of rubble as possible, while hitting the odd floating target along the way.</p> <p>The controls are simple enough; players reach forward so their avatar grabs the firing mechanism of the ballista and then, when prompted, they step forward making their avatar step into a semi-circle marked out on the ground. They then take a step back and watch as their avatar draws back on the ballista.</p> <p>The level of accuracy offered in each shot is impressive; the player can measure the trajectory of each shot in inches, by nudging a tad to the left or right, or stooping and straightening. Once the player is satisfied with how they've lined up their shot, they fire it by lifting their arms so they're perpendicular to their body.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395572150\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/3/1346665131310/Wreckateer2-008.jpg\" alt=\"Wreckateer2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wreckateer lets you control over a projectile once it is airborne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once the shot is airborne, the camera switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to influence the direction of their missile. There are a variety of projectiles available including bog-standard rocks, boulders that splinter into four smaller stones, exploding rocks and stones that speed up once activated while in flight. By slapping the air in front of them, players can coax their missiles a little to the left and right or up or down. They activate any special ability their boulder has by raising both arms.</p> <p>There's one projectile in the game's arsenal that allows the player a greater degree of control while in-flight: the Flying Shot. Once they've launched, players can raise their arms to cause a pair of wings to open, and they can then guide the Flying Shot with a greater degree of control and finesse by ducking and weaving their body. This allows them to pilot the Flying Shot through openings, hitting targets and parcels of explosives that are dotted around the target buildings.</p> <p>Players have three types of medal to aim for in each level: gold, silver and bronze. As one would expect, earning a gold in the early stages of the game is absolute child's play, but The Wreckateer ramps up the difficulty as time goes on. It soon becomes apparent that the game awards points based on the player's ability to hit certain targets or detonate the aforementioned packs of explosives to cause the maximum amount of damage in the targets.</p> <p>While this all sounds pretty straightforward, it's actually pretty tricky to pull off and this is entirely down to the lack of control the Kinect module offers. As The Wreckateer's difficulty increases, players will find their efforts at scoring a gold medal continually thwarted by Kinect misinterpreting their movements. Success, then, starts to hinge on a combination of timing and luck, and in the more challenging stages of the game, this can lead to some highly frustrating moments (and a lot of swearing).</p> <p>This lack of precision doesn't make The Wreckateer unique among Kinect titles \u2013 nor does the requirement that before purchasing it, players need to ensure they have enough space in their living room to duck and weave about with their arms outstretched. In all fairness, Wreckateer is easily one of the strongest titles made for the Kinect module, but it's not good enough to transcend the device's weaknesses.</p> <p>It also doesn't help that, once players have played the game for about an hour, they've discovered pretty much everything it has to offer. The level design is rather unmemorable overall, and the game doesn't really have anything along the lines of a plot or a series of unlockables to keep players engaged in the long-term. It works all right as a party game, but in that context its imprecise controls are part of the fun.</p> <p>There's a lot to like about The Wreckateer; it's a fun, if slightly lightweight offering, and its Kinect controls are well implemented. But as good as it is, The Wreckateer won't win over anyone who isn't already convinced by Kinect. It looks like players may have to wait for the next generation of consoles before that's even possible.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",
  "<p>It often begins before you've even finished your holiday \u2013 a miserable, panicky feeling in your gut reminding you that you'll soon be returning to work. No one enjoys going back to the grindstone after a fun-filled break, but is there any way to prevent all the energy and optimism you felt while lying on a sun lounger from evaporating overnight? Try our simple tips to massage your re-entry to the workplace.</p> <h2><strong>1. Take an extra day off</strong></h2> <p>Rather than coming back from time off and heading straight to the office, take an extra day's leave for personal admin and, should you have travelled, to recover from your journey. \"If you take a Monday off, a four-day week to ease you back in is a much more bearable prospect,\" says Daniel Callaghan, who runs his own business, <a href=\"http://www.MBAandCo.com\">MBAandCo.com</a>. </p> <h2><strong>2. Prepare well</strong></h2> <p>Callaghan suggests people scan their emails before going into the office, and consider phoning a colleague for a catch up and to avoid any nasty surprises first morning back.</p> <p>Anna Bastek, who runs her own firm <a href=\"http://www.wolfestone.co.uk\" title=\"Wolfestone Translation website\">Wolfestone Translation</a>, says: \"Before coming back to work I categorise my emails on the BlackBerry, and delete all spam. This helps save time on my return for the real business issues of the day.\"</p> <p>The downside of this is that you might find something negative has occurred in your absence, which could sour the final night of your holiday.</p> <h2><strong>3. Take it slowly</strong></h2> <p>Ease yourself into work gently rather than diving in headfirst without a plan. When you first get back make a to-do list so you have an action plan from which to work. This should comprise a short list of realistic tasks to be done in the first day or two, as well as a list of longer-term projects you need to manage.</p> <p>\"I always try and keep my diary clear for my return,\" Bastek says. \"No external meetings are arranged for the first couple of days to give myself time to catch up. Telling people you are unavailable, or going to a quiet room to go through the workload, are two strategies I use for getting back up to speed after a break.\"</p> <h2><strong>4. Hit the delete key</strong></h2> <p>Barney Jones at <a href=\"http://www.xlntelecom.co.uk/\" title=\"XLN Business Services website\">XLN Business Services</a> suggests you move all the emails you received while you were away into an archive folder: \"You could easily spend hours trawling through them, finding problem after problem that has either long since been resolved or forgotten. Instead, copy the emails for reference to an archive folder along with any pre-holiday mail and wait \u2013 people will always chase you for important things, especially if you set an out-of-office autoreply while away.\"</p> <p>If you have to laboriously check every email then make sure your boss understands that is what you are doing, so you don't end up trying to check them while taking on new work.</p> <h2><strong>5. Keep your out of office on</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Don't be too trigger-happy in turning an out-of-office message off, because once you do people will know you're back and will begin chasing you. \"Instead of being on the back foot, why not leave it running for an extra day and spend the extra time on more strategic planning?\" Jones suggests.</p> <h2><strong>6. Make a change</strong></h2> <p>A new project that differs from your regular work could have the dual effect of inspiring you with a fresh challenge as well as indicating to your superiors you have returned to work with a positive, ambitious attitude.</p> <p>Jones suggests you spend two hours without a computer to think about the new, post-holiday you. \"Think, what are the key priorities you should have between now and Christmas? What do you need to change that will make a big difference? Where have your energies been wasted in the past? Write these big ideas down in capital letters on a post-it note and stick it somewhere prominent.\"</p> <h2><strong>7. Book more time off</strong></h2> <p>Many people book their next break the second they get back from their current one. It's much easier to throw yourself into a period of hard work if you have something to look forward to.</p>",

  "<p>I'm marking my return from holiday by serialising the second and updated edition of <em>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial.*</em> It has several new chapters, along with revisions to previous chapters. </p> <p>I am beginning with my contribution, an afterword that seeks to place phone hacking in some sort of historical perspective. Before I do that, let me draw your attention to two statements made to the Leveson inquiry:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Let me assure you the British press is vastly better behaved and disciplined than when I started in newspapers in the seventies. Then much of its behaviour was outrageous. </p> <p>It was not uncommon for reporters to steal photographs from homes. Blatant subterfuge was commonly used. There were no restraints on invasions of privacy. Harassment was the rule rather than the exception.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That was Paul Dacre, Daily Mail editor, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/12/paul-dacre-leveson-speech\">addressing one of the pre-inquiry seminars in October last year.</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"Over the years unethical practices such as reporters entering hospitals pretending to be relatives of a patient to get a story have thankfully ceased.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That was Mazher Mahmood, former News of the World investigations editor, <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Witness-Statement-of-Mazher-Mahmood.pdf\">in his first witness statement to the inquiry in December last year.</a></p> <p>Both were owning up to bad behaviour by journalists in the past in order to suggest that things had got better. But my afterword, while largely accepting the truth of their statements, has a different slant...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395567421\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/3/1346657132255/Hacking.book.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"219\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The interception of private voicemail messages was not an isolated incident that arrived out of nowhere. It was not an aberration, as most of the current editors of popular newspapers would wish us, and the Leveson inquiry, to believe. </p> <p>It should be viewed instead as the culmination of an historical process stretching back many years and, at the same time, as a consequence of the mode of ownership of our press. </p> <p>When I first entered journalism in the early 1960s, working on a local newspaper in a highly competitive news area on the fringes of east London, I became aware that some less than scrupulous reporters were prepared to bend the rules in order to obtain stories and/or pictures. Not that there were any rules as such. </p> <p>In those days, there was no industry written code of behaviour, nor would there be until 1991. When I joined the National Union of Journalists it was pointed out that it had a code, which seemed reasonable enough. But I can never remember anyone quoting it, and certainly not at the college where we apprentices studied once a week to gain our proficiency certificates.</p> <p>We were learning our trade on the job and within our offices ethical guidelines were largely set by individual editors. They relied on some rough-and-ready assimilation of custom and practice to guide their decision-making. </p> <p>I am happy to report that my first editor was anything but a rogue, and I am sure that the rest of my colleagues in our tiny office also acted honourably.</p> <p>We got to know of instances, admittedly rare, where reporters on rival newspapers did things of which we disapproved. One rarely attended magistrates' court, for example, but dared to write reports based on briefings from those of us who did. </p> <p>A couple of boastful reporters told of \"borrowing\" pictures when interviewing bereaved people, though I readily concede that this practice is much disputed and has gained urban myth status.</p> <p>Certainly, there were instances of composing quotable quotes because interviewees were often inarticulate or tongue-tied. I own up to that. And I recall impersonating a pop group manager in a telephone call in order to trap an impresario suspected of taking back-handers when booking bands.</p> <p>My initial direct experience of unethical journalistic behaviour occurred when I moonlighted at a London news agency. On my first shift I was sent to cover a house fire in which an elderly former actress had perished. </p> <p>The bad-tempered news editor gave me the name of a policeman I would find at the house and told me to approach him out of earshot of his colleagues so that he could hand over a \"collect photo\". I thought little of it until I arrived at the scene and quickly ascertained that the officer had removed it from the house. </p> <p>Did I hand it back? Of course I didn't. Did it concern me? Not a jot. It just seemed to me then, barely 18 years old at the time, that I had moved into the world of grown-ups. I certainly didn't pay the officer and have no idea whether any money changed hands later. He was clearly friendly with the news editor, asking me to pass on a message about their meeting soon for a drink.</p> <p>In subsequent shifts I came to realise that the news agency used the services of an \"earwigger\", a person employed to listen in to police radio calls, arguably an illegal activity. </p> <p>It meant that reporters sometimes arrived at incidents simultaneously with the police. Many years later, when writing my history of the British press, I discovered that the London Evening News scooped the opposition to break the story of the Great Train Robbery in 1963 due to a tip from an earwigger.</p> <p>The news agency, and all Fleet Street news desks at the time, traced people by using what were called \"reverse telephone directories\". These were supposed to be restricted to police and emergency services. </p> <p>Though it was said to be against the law to own them and use them I never heard of any action being taken. The real lesson here is that many journalists thought they were illegal and were completely untroubled by the fact. </p> <p>It was, if you like, part of an unwritten code. Journalists believed they had special rights. I grew to understand that we operated to our own rules. I cannot remember ever talking about the freedom of the press but I guess our elders and betters would have used that justification if pushed. Then again, nobody did push.</p> <p>Living inside the journalistic bubble, especially at a time of even greater official secrecy and bureaucratic opacity than exists today, inured us to criticism. We tended to admire those reporters who indulged in outrageous stunts to obtain stories. These were \"operators\", people who always managed to get the story their editors wanted. </p> <p>Reporters on national Sunday newspapers of the 1950s were noted for their scoop-getting exploits. The great and the good of popular journalism, including editorial overlords such as the Mirror group's Hugh Cudlipp, liked nothing better than to tell stories of ethically suspect escapades.</p> <p>A website called GentlemenRanters.com is a goldmine of veteran reporters' reminiscences about dodgy practices, including the composing of fake expenses, another example of journalistic illegality that we all considered totally harmless - just a bit of fun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395567422\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/3/1346657732936/phpvYlAXyAM.jpg\" alt=\"fly\" width=\"460\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Reporters were only too happy to get up to all sorts of tricks to obtain stories (as Dacre and Mahmood told Leveson). Some of them might well be regarded as unethical and even illegal. Reporters dressed in white coats to get into hospital wards. They routinely blagged information in telephone calls to bureaucrats. They had little respect for privacy.</p> <p>Photographers thought nothing of trespassing. The cheque books were opened regularly. Meanwhile, back in the office, editors were requiring sub-editors to \"improve\" quotes and stretch heavily angled stories almost to breaking point. And all of this was common before we reached the watershed of the Profumo affair in 1963, a defining moment in the history of press misconduct.</p> <p>Amid a feeding frenzy, people's privacy was invaded. They were pursued and harassed. Much of what was published was wildly inaccurate, misleading and distorted. There was invention on a grand scale. People who had been convicted of crimes were paid by newspapers. Even trial witnesses were promised money, on occasion just before they were about to give evidence. </p> <p>Newspapers competed to publish ever more sensational stories under lurid headlines. There was an obsession with sex and spies, much of it fanciful. The subsequent censures by the regulator of the time, the Press Council, were treated with scorn by editors.</p> <p>The News of the World's editor published an article attacking the Press Council for failing to appreciate that the revelations had been in the public interest.</p> <p>The episode reinforced, yet again, the feeling that journalists need not<br>concern themselves with ethics. They had a privileged position in society<br>because they were acting on behalf of that society. </p> <p>In 1973, the News of the World's leading investigative journalist, Trevor Kempson, was responsible for the resignations of two junior Conservative ministers, Lords Lambton and Jellicoe, because of their liaisons with prostitutes. </p> <p>In Lambton's case, the newspaper had paid the prostitute and her husband to obtain photographs taken through a two-way mirror. Though the newspaper's editor was too nervous to publish, Lambton suspected that it would and resigned his post as air minister.</p> <p>Both the News of the World and The People promptly published the story. Their public interest justification, that Lambton's actions constituted a threat to national security, was found to be bogus. </p> <p>In Jellicoe's case, an inquiry concluded that there had been \"nothing in his conduct to suggest that the risk of indiscretions on these occasions was other than negligible.\"</p> <p>For years afterwards, Kempson, a well-known pub raconteur, loved to tell how he concealed a microphone in the nose of a teddy bear on the prostitute's bed. Kempson carried out many investigations involving sexual indiscretions and was regarded as something of a hero among News of the World colleagues, especially by newcomers who were eager to emulate his success.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> The dark days of the 1980s, the Diana years and the rise of celebrity journalism</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September</p>",

Allegations of brainwashing which were common in the 1980s have rarely been heard since.</p> <p>Moon was born in what would become North Korea in 1920 to a family that followed Confucian beliefs, but when he was 10 years old the family converted to Christianity and joined the Presbyterian church.</p> <p>Moon said he was 16 when Jesus Christ called upon him to complete His work. He said he resisted twice before finally accepting the task.</p> <p>He was jailed for five years by the North Korean government in 1948, but escaped in 1950 when his guards fled as United Nations troops advanced. He was an active anti-Communist throughout the cold war.</p> <p>Moon founded the church in 1954 amid the ruins of South Korea and promoted a mixture of Christianity and his own conservative, family-oriented teachings. He preached new interpretations of lessons from the Bible, and fused elements of Christianity and Confucianism \u2013 outlining his principles in his book, Explanation of the Divine Principle, published in 1957.</p> <p>In later years, the church built a business empire that included the Washington Times newspaper, the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, Bridgeport University in Connecticut, as well as a hotel and a car plant in North Korea. It acquired a ski resort, a professional soccer team and other businesses in South Korea, and a seafood firm that supplies sushi to Japanese restaurants across the United States.</p> <p>In 1982, the church sponsored the American film Inchon, about the Korean war.</p> <p>Moon began rebuilding his relationship with North Korea in 1991, when he met the country's founder, Kim Il Sung, in the eastern industrial city of Hamhung. In his autobiography, Moon said he asked Kim to give up his nuclear ambitions, and Kim responded that his atomic programme was for peaceful purposes and he had no intention to use it to \"kill my own people\".</p> <p>\"The two of us were able to communicate well about our shared hobbies of hunting and fishing. At one point, we each felt we had so much to say to the other that we just started talking like old friends meeting after a long separation,\" Moon wrote.</p> <p>He added that he heard Kim tell his son: \"After I die, if there are things to discuss pertaining to north-south relations, you must always seek the advice of President Moon.\"</p> <p>When Kim died in 1994, Moon sent a condolence delegation to North Korea, drawing criticism from conservatives at home. Kim's son and successor, Kim Jong Il, sent roses, prized wild ginseng, Rolex watches and other gifts to Moon on his birthday each year. Kim Jong Il died late last year and was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un. Moon sent a delegation to pay respects during the mourning period for Kim Jong Il.</p> <p>The church leader also developed good relationships with conservative American leaders, including Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Senior. However, he was found guilty of tax evasion in the United States, where he lived for 30 years, and served 13 months of an 18 month sentence.</p> <p>As he grew older, Moon quietly handed over day-to-day control of his multibillion-dollar religious and business empire, companies ranging from hospitals and universities to a ballet troupe.</p> <p>His youngest son, the Rev Hyung-jin Moon, was named the church's top religious director in April 2008. Other sons and daughters were put in charge of the church's business and charitable activities in South Korea and abroad.</p> <p>After ending his first marriage, Moon wedded a South Korean, Hak Ja Han Moon, in 1960. She often was at Moon's side for the mass weddings.</p> <p>Their youngest son told the Associated Press in a February 2010 interview that Moon's offspring do not see themselves as his successors.</p> <p>\"Our role is not inheriting that messianic role,\" he said. \"Our role is more of the apostles, where we share \u2026 where we become the bridge between understanding what kind of lives [our] two parents have lived.\"</p> <p>Moon is survived by his second wife and 10 children.</p> <h2><strong>Marriage lines</strong></h2> <p>The Reverend Sun Myung Moon's mass weddings were a central aspect of the Unification Church. He conducted his first in Seoul in the early 1960s, and the \"blessing ceremonies\" grew in scale over the years. A 1982 wedding at New York's Madison Square Garden, the first outside South Korea, drew thousands of participants.</p> <p>\"International and intercultural marriages are the quickest way to bring about an ideal world of peace,\" Moon said in a 2009 autobiography. \"People should marry across national and cultural boundaries with people from countries they consider to be their enemies so that the world of peace can come that much more quickly.\"</p> <p>In 2009, Moon married 45,000 people in simultaneous ceremonies worldwide in his first large-scale mass wedding in years, the church said.</p>",

Fiona Nicholson, a home education consultant based in Sheffield who gave evidence to the committee in 2010, told the <em>Guardian</em>: </p> <blockquote> <p>The state is coming into family life and trying to regulate it. It is an extraordinary invasion of the family.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The home education community was generally alarmed and upset, and began a fightback that made history when 70 MP's presented 120 constituency petitions opposing changes qualifying the right to home educate.</p> <p>Another northern home-edder, Denise McCallum, told the select committee:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Badman proposals would destroy the things we have achieved in North Yorkshire. A lot of home educators in North Yorkshire have withdrawn from engagement with the council in protest.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> The children, schools and families committee concluded that it was:</p> <blockquote> <p>unsafe for the Badman review to have reached such a strong conclusion about the relative risks of a child being home educated or school educated. The proposals in the children, schools and families bill run into difficulty in their conflation of education and safeguarding. </p> </blockquote> <p>Now the Government is at mid-term, and suddenly attention has turned again to home education. For a myriad of reasons \u2013 dissatisfaction , religious observance, and philosophical belief\u2013 more and more families are rejecting mainstream provision. Home-edders fall broadly into three camps: for some it is an alternative to mainstream, others feel forced into it by a failure of mainstream to meet their children's needs, and the third group value it as a way of educating in accordance with faith. Whichever the reason, this broad church feels strongly about the right to 'educate otherwise'.</p> <p>The Ishaq siblings, three with special educational needs, were assumed to be home educated after they disappeared from mainstream school. Home education carried the can for what were actually multiple agency failings. Birmingham city council officials visited to assess the family; children's social care did not follow up a referral from Khyra's school; police concluded that the children were safe during a welfare visit. </p> <p>As with Baby P and Victoria Climbie, various visits and opportunities to instigate statutory powers were missed. Would increased powers over home education have saved this little girl's life, when agency <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jul/27/khyra-ishaq-home-education-safeguards-call\">failings were identified </a>as the crucial factor contributing to her death?</p> <p>To what extent should the state be empowered to monitor the home educated child? </p> <p>In 2010, Labour was keen to emphasise that there was a need to build positive relationships between local authorities and home-educating families. Now, two years later, the committee is taking evidence from home educators who are concerned that there is evidence of Badman by the back door. </p> <p>Education Leeds advised that powers should be introduced to compel parents to provide written information at least annually on the educational provision they are making for their children and ensure that the child is present at an annual meeting with the LA. Current policy attempts to ensure these conditions are met.</p> <p>In 2009, North Yorkshire relations with home educators were cited as evidence of good practice in relations which the council had built over a number of years with home-edders in the county. North Yorkshire had adopted a policy of non-intrusive, non-judgmental intervention which had paid off with greater numbers engaging with advisers. The authority published a termly newsletter, met regularly with home educators and arranged opportunities for home educating children to sit exams externally. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395556810\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/2/1346603041156/Homeschool2.jpg\" alt=\"home education\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home education offers families dissatisfied with mainstream provision the opportunity to tailor education to their children's needs, interests, and abilities.

North Yorkshire's latest policy requires home education advisers to 'ensure the safety, welfare and education of the home educated child' - a considerable expansion of the established interpretation of existing legislation.</p> <p>The North Yorkshire elective home education (EHE) team now aims to maintain contact with all families on an annual basis and, if families are in agreement,makes a visit to establish that a suitable education is being provided. Where there is lawful refusal to engage with the LA, the EHE team aims to resolve the situation and to re-engage the family wherever possible with maintained education - a move hardly likely to build positive relations.</p> <p>North Yorkshire regards hard-to-engage families as 'an ongoing challenge' in a recent summary report to the council's young people's scrutiny committee. There is currently no requirement for families to register home education or to respond to enquiries about suitability of education provided.

Sadly the government have not recognised this and are driving for a more aggressive system.</p> </blockquote> <p>The question that many home educators are asking is: who, or what is driving that campaign.</p> <p><em><strong>Anne Czernik</strong> is a freelance photojournalist specialising in activism in the north of England.</em></p>",
