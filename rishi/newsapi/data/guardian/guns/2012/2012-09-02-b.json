  "<p>After three days of Paralympic competition the athletics stadium finally has its Mo Farah moment. A day that began brightly for the British team was threatening to slide into anticlimax until David Weir pushed a tactically perfect T54 5,000m race, tracking the leaders throughout before a surge from the final bend took him to gold.</p> <p>The 80,000 crowd roared the 33-year-old Londoner home beyond his long-time rival, Australia's Kurt Fearnley, keeping the noise at deafening levels for an exultant lap of honour. The reception made him \"the proudest man on the earth\", said Weir, who won GB's only two athletics titles in Beijing, in the 800m and 1,500m, along with bronze in the 5,000m and 400m. \"You dream about things like this,\" he said, still beaming. \"Winning on your home turf is extra special. I'm a London lad.\"</p> <p>The day began promisingly with Stef Reid taking silver in the T42/T44 long jump \u2013 the vagaries of the classification system meant she leaped 90cm further than the gold medallist, Kelly Cartwright of Australia \u2013 closely followed by Aled Davies winning the F42 shot put.</p> <p>After the disappointment of Shelly Woods finishing eighth in the women's T54 5,000m the crowd rose as Graham Ballard led almost throughout his men's T36 100m final, only to be overtaken at the last by Russia's Evgenii Shvetcov a few metres from the line. Ballard said of his silver: \"It was a fantastic race. I'm a bit disappointed I didn't get gold but I couldn't have done any better. It was just so close.\" It was the 33-year-old's best Paralympic result, after the bronze he got in the 200m equivalent in Beijing.</p> <p>Soon afterwards Libby Clegg, accompanied by her sighted guide, Mikhail Huggins, took a hugely popular silver in the T12 100m. It was quite a day for the Clegg household as shortly beforehand her brother, James, took bronze in the Aquatics Centre in the men's S12 100m butterfly.</p> <p>But as the evening session wore on, with the Chinese and Russian anthems seemingly on repeat during an endless sequence of medal ceremonies, there were no more home victories. Reid had a chance in the T44 100m of improving on her silver but finished a hugely disappointing eighth.Hers was the penultimate race, leaving the home supporters' hopes pinned on Weir, who won a record-equalling sixth London marathon in April.</p> <p>He did not disappoint. Sitting in the lead group throughout, and often in the pacesetter's direct slipstream, Weir coped with a series of late attacks by Switzerland's Marcel Hug to peel round the final bend with a spurt of speed which saw him close out Fearnley, who won the event in 2004 and is aiming at a third straight marathon gold, and France's Julien Casoli in bronze.</p> <p>\"I just knew I had to sit on Marcel's wheel because he was the fastest guy in the field. So I've sat on his wheel and waited for the perfect moment,\" said Weir, adding that he had tried as much as possible to block out the \"quite scary\" crowd noise.</p> <p>\"It was a tough race. Marcel had a lot of speed behind him. I just had to race really well. I was in great form coming into this. All the other races I've done this year was just preparation for this. Winning the London marathon was a fantastic achievement but I've always said that from September onwards everything I do is purely for this competition. Just because I want to win on my home turf.\"</p> <p>Asked about his emotional state, Weir replied: \"You don't need to ask me that really. It's the best feeling ever.\"</p> <p>He begins the defence of his 1,500m title first thing Monday. Weir said: \"I've got to be out of my room by 7am. I just hope doping control are quick or I'm there all night. I just hope I can get to sleep. I'm experienced enough to do it. I'll be OK. I'll still talk to the doctors, hope they can help, knock me out a little bit.\"</p> <p>There will be debate as to whether Reid should also be celebrating gold. Mixed-classification events are a vexed issue for the Paralympics, especially as some, like the long jump, are adjusted for impairment while others, for example track races, are not. They exist because some classifications do not have sufficient numbers. But, as Reid pointed out, Sunday's final had 16 entrants.</p> <p>The 27-year-old, who competed in Beijing for Canada, the country where she was brought up by parents from Glasgow and Darlington before accepting an offer to switch allegiances, described the mixed classification as \"quite a controversial area\".</p> <p>\"It's tough but now's not the time to get upset about it,\" said Reid. \"Kelly was a great competitor, she jumped amazingly. She deserved it and hopefully in the future it will be reviewed again but I think today was just about celebrating. The reality is if you jump far you will win, and so no complaints.\"</p>",
  "<p>Israel is \"pillaging\" the natural resources of the Dead Sea which lie in occupied Palestinian territory in violation of international law, a report which singles out the cosmetics firm Ahava for criticism.</p> <p>According to the Palestinian human rights organisation al-Haq, the \"appropriation and exploitation of Palestinian land and natural resources in the occupied Dead Sea area by Israeli settlers and companies \u2026 meet the requirements of the crime of pillage\".</p> <p>Its report, Pillage of the Dead Sea, says Israeli restrictions on planning and movement \"have severely hampered the ability of Palestinians to use and access their land and other natural resources in the region. The presence of settlers who directly utilise and profit from the Dead Sea wealth has severely exacerbated this situation and contributed to the over-exploitation of the area, resulting in severe environmental damage.\"</p> <p>Almost two-thirds of the western shore of the Dead Sea lies within the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. The remaining area is in Israel, and the eastern shore is in Jordan. At the lowest point on Earth, 410 metres below sea level, the inland sea is a magnet for tourists keen to float in its salt-saturated waters and for industries which extract its minerals.</p> <p>Ahava Dead Sea Laboratories, which manufactures and markets beauty products based on Dead Sea minerals and mud, is located within the Israeli settlement of Mitzpe Shalem in the West Bank. It is licensed by the Israeli government to mine Dead Sea raw materials. According to al-Haq, almost 45% of its shares are owned by Mitzpe Shalem and another Israeli settlement on the Dead Sea shore, Kalia.</p> <p>Within two decades of its launch in 1988, Ahava's annual global sales had reached almost $150m (\u00a395m). The company has been the target of boycott campaigns by anti-settlement activists, which contributed to its decision to close its store in Covent Garden, London, a year ago.</p> <p>The al-Haq report says Ahava is \"unlawfully utilising the Palestinian natural resources of the Dead Sea area for its own economic profits and therefore can be considered directly responsible for the pillage of the occupied territory's natural resources in clear violation of customary international law\".</p> <p>However, in a letter circulated in 2010, Ahava said: \"The mud and minerals used in Ahava's cosmetic products are not excavated in an occupied area. The minerals are mined in the Israeli part of the Dead Sea, which is undisputed internationally.\"</p> <p>Ahava did not respond to a request for comment on the al-Haq report.</p> <p>The land along the Dead Sea shore was classified as \"Area C\" in the 1993 Oslo accords, in which Israel has full military and administrative control. Much of the land has been declared or registered as \"state land\", which has \"dispossessed Palestinians of extensive portions of the Dead Sea land, effectively depriving them of the possibility of benefiting from [its] natural resources,\" according to the report.</p> <p>Al-Haq says \"Israel is openly in violation of its obligations under international and humanitarian law as an occupying power \u2026 because it is encouraging and facilitating the exploitation of Palestinian natural resources and actively assisting their pillaging by private actors.\" It cites The Hague regulations and the statute of the international criminal court.</p> <p>In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said that, under the Oslo accords, Israel had territorial jurisdiction that includes land, subsoil and territorial waters in Area C. It \"therefore would be entitled to licence a company to excavate mud in that area if it chose to do so\".</p> <p>The al-Haq report calls on the European Union to adopt restrictions on the import of Israeli products originating from settlements, and urges cosmetic retailers to provide clear information about the origin of products they sell to allow consumers to make an informed choice about purchases. <strong> </strong></p>",

However, this was just a scheduling quirk, perhaps deliberate.</p> <p>In a fitting illustration of Britain's increasing struggle to remain track cycling's top dog, the final race in perhaps the loudest and most dramatic of the venues at London 2012 saw China edge ParalympicsGB's team sprinters out of gold by six hundredths of a second.</p> <p>It was agonising for Darren Kenny, Rik Waddon and John-Allan Butterworth, the last of whom now has three second places in his first Paralympics. They broke the world record in their heat, to see China to go four thousandths of a second quicker. GB beat that new mark in the final, only for their opponents to go faster still in the three-lap race.</p> <p>Waddon, 35, who won a silver in the 1km time trial in Beijing, admitted that he had allowed himself to dream about winning gold in London. He said: \"We've done a staggering time but we got beaten by another nation. It's something you can't control. It's good competition. The crowd were loving it. We dominated in Beijing but the others have stepped up. We were sort of expecting that. We can only go for Rio now.\"</p> <p>The final day of racing at the velodrome was, by any standards, a stunning success for the British riders: three medals events bringing in a gold, two silvers and a bronze. This left Britain on top of the track medals table again, with five golds, the same as China, and 15 medals in all.</p> <p>But the country's Paralympian cyclists are not judged to normal measures. While in Beijing they won fewer medals, 13, there were 12 golds. Here, it was five.</p> <p>The fifth and final gold was guaranteed shortly after lunch when both pairings in the men's tandem sprint won through to the final.</p> <p>The event is arguably the most thrilling of any in the velodrome \u2013 the cat and mouse slow-fast-slow-sprint tactics of the individual sprint somehow carried out by two sets of legs in unison.</p> <p>The final was vindication for Anthony Kappes, who, with his sighted \"pilot\", the former Olympic rider Craig MacLean, lost the chance to defend his Beijing 1km time trial title on Saturday when their chain slipped on both their two permitted chances to start the heats.</p> <p>The pair dismissed Neil Fachie and his pilot, Barney Storey \u2013 who went on to take gold in the time trial \u2013 2-0 in the best of three sprint final.</p> <p>Kappes, who is 39, reported that he had spent Saturday feeling \"like the cat's died or something\". He said: \"You don't get many opportunities. Yesterday we blew it. Not our fault, but still. Today was a chance to demonstrate what we can do. Can't complain.\"</p> <p>The diminutive Fachie and his hulking pilot, who with their helmets on resemble an absurdly fast father and son team, accepted they were well beaten. \"Those guys were better than us. There's no doubt about it,\" Fachie said.</p> <p>Defeat in the team event had some consolation, a silver lining for Kenny. The 42-year-old's second place medal makes him the most decorated Paralympian cyclist, ahead of Australia's Christopher Scott, who won six gold medals, two silver and a bronze from 1996 to 2008.</p> <p>\"Chris is one of the nicest guys I know, and he's a big hero of mine,\" Kenny said. \"It's nice to finally nudge him out of the way.\"</p> <p>While he will be 46 by the time of the Rio Games, Kenny said he hoped to be there: \"It's sunny there, of course. Why wouldn't I? Just buy me a plane ticket and I'll be there. I'll start preparing tomorrow if you like.\"</p> <p>Butterworth, meanwhile, now has three silver medals in his debut Games. \"Silver again,\" he said, contemplating the giant, shiny trinket around his neck, \"But we couldn't have done any more than we did.\"</p> <p>He would probably be well advised not to share his woes with Lora Turnham, who with her sighted pilot Fiona Duncan picked up her second consecutive fourth place, this time in their preferred event, the tandem pursuit.</p> <p>If only making the bronze medal race was bad enough, they were then beaten by fellow Britons Aileen McGlynn and Helen Scott, themselves smarting from silver in Friday's tandem time trial, for which they were the clear favourites.</p> <p>Turnham, 24, pointed out that she had already endured two fourth places, at the 2009 world championships: \"I found it really annoying then, and it's even more so now.\"</p> <p>She will be consoled by Fachie, her boyfriend for the past two years. Asked why so many track riders seem to end up dating each other, Turnham had an endearingly frank reply: \"We see so much of each other, and we don't get social lives as we're always training. Where else are we going to meet people?\"</p>",
  "<p>Leicester City is not Ian Holloway's happiest hunting ground. \"I've not won there for years,\" he said before taking Blackpool to the King Power Stadium on Saturday evening, \"and I'm fed up of that.\" He was even more fed up after City had ended Blackpool's 100% start to the Championship season with a 1-0 victory, though his club still top the table. At the final whistle he stormed down the tunnel. The rant was yet to come, as well as the handshake with City's Nigel Pearson. \"If it looked rude, I apologise,\" said Holloway later.</p> <p>In fact he won nine matches at Leicester in 2007-08, when he was City's manager for six months \u2013 not enough to prevent them dropping into the third tier for the first time in their history. \"It was like my worst nightmare,\" he said. \"But I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing at Blackpool without what happened to me at Leicester.\"</p> <p>What he has done at Blackpool has been one of the wonders of the game's greedy world. With a chairman, Karl Oyston, who refuses to play the agents' game or to pay outlandish wages, he has in three years given them a Premier League season between Championship final play-offs. At the same time Bloomfield Road has been developed for greater things. Whatever fans think \u2013 in 2001 they were in the fourth tier, in 2007 the third \u2013 they have a local owner, in or out of jail, who has backed the club for 25 years. Leicester, meanwhile, report a \u00a315m loss and \u00a327.5m loans from their Thai owners at 8% interest.</p> <p>None of this was on Holloway's mind after City's win, though he did recall that in May's Wembley play-off \"we almost beat West Ham on four times our budget.\" His grievance here was the penalty award by Mike Jones for an adjudged push by Tiago Gomes on Jamie Vardy shortly after half-time. \"The boy's blatantly dived. If someone's pushed, they don't go up in the air. The ref's made a human error and he shouldn't be allowed to.\" His thrust was that the fourth official, with access to TV replay, could with superhuman power overrule his colleague in five seconds.</p> <p>\"If the fellow in the red shirt did his job as well as we did ours, we'd have got a point,\" Holloway went on. \"Someone of his quality and experience shouldn't be influenced by the crowd.\" The crowd were, indeed, up in vocal arms. Just before, as the Foxes reprised their flying start of the first half, Jones had declined penalties for challenges by Stephen Crainey and Neal Eardley and ruled out a \"goal\" by Andy King when two team-mates, behind the outstanding goalkeeper Matt Gilks, were not interfering with play. \"I wouldn't mind if they had scored those,\" Holloway said.</p> <p>Blackpool were always playing catch-up in terms of control and only in the latter stages of each half did they bring Thomas Ince into threatening play. At the end of the first-half Barry Ferguson hit a post. At the end of the second they were playing 4-2-4 with typical Holloway gung-ho.</p> <p>Harking back, the manager noted how tight decisions go to the big club and Blackpool \"officially\" lost out on nine points in the Premier League when two more would have kept them up. But here they are a big club, top of a pile in which six points cover 23 clubs with 42 games to go. For once it was a case of mixed messages not metaphors, plenty vented nothing gained. For Holloway it seldom is at Leicester.</p>",
  "<p>For the past 15 years Miguel Guerra has been living in the shadows as an undocumented Latino immigrant in the US. He kept out of view, avoided public places and never spoke his mind to anyone outside his immediate family.</p> <p>Not any more.</p> <p>Under a blazing North Carolina sun, Guerra joined almost 50 other undocumented Latino immigrants on a Sunday in a park on the outskirts of Charlotte, the North Carolinan venue of this week's Democratic national convention. It was in effect a mass coming out ceremony.</p> <p>For the past six weeks the group has been riding across the American south in a converted Greyhound bus bearing the slogan: \"No Papers No Fear\". They have stopped in about 20 cities in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia before arriving in North Carolina, holding rallies and confronting anti-Latino prejudice along the way.</p> <p>\"We're no longer afraid to say we are undocumented,\" Guerra declared.</p> <p>For a busload of unauthorised immigrants to ride openly through some of these areas is no joke, even in 2012. Several of the states \u2013 notably Arizona where the journey began, Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia \u2013</p> <p>have been at the forefront of the push across the southern states to tighten immigration laws with the express intention of driving out thousands of illegal Latinos back to Mexico.</p> <p>Guerra knows firsthand how perilous the journey was. Early on in the ride he and three other members of the No Papers No Fear group held a civil disobedience protest outside the courthouse in Phoenix, Arizona where Sheriff Arpaio, the controversial architect of harsh policing methods against undocumented Latinos, was at that time on trial for alleged civil rights abuses.</p> <p>Guerra, 36, was arrested, paradoxically handed over to Arpaio's own police department, which in turn passed him to the immigration authorities. He was detained for three days and is still immersed in deportation proceedings. Had he known that he would be arrested and potentially deported, he insists he still would have gone ahead with the bus ride. \"They want to criminalise me, but we are showing that I'm not the criminal, Arpaio is.\"</p> <p>Would he still think the protest was worth it should he be deported back to Baja California, the region of Mexico from which he came aged 21 to try his luck in the US? \"Yes. At least I know I played a part in history here, and can leave with my head held high.\"</p> <p>Organisers of the bus ride, from a coalition of the National Day Laborer Organisation, Puente and other groups, designed the journey to begin in Arizona, the state that led the anti-illegal immigrant offensive with its notorious law SB 1070. They decided to end the trip at the Democratic national convention in Charlotte, rather than in Tampa where the Republicans convened last week, because they hoped to have more impact attempting to influence the Democratic debate.</p> <p>There have been sparks during the six weeks of the ride. After the arrests in Phoenix, there was further confrontation with police in Knoxsville, Tennessee, where riders carried out a protest outside the office of Sheriff JJ Jones, who has plans to implement a deportation program known as 287(g).</p> <p>Four were arrested, including two undocumented people, though they were later released.</p> <p>The bus also stopped in Sylva in the west of the state of North Carolina. The organisers of the ride had heard that the sheriff there, Jimmy Ashe, had been erecting check points outside Latino neighbourhoods in the area where the police, backed up by immigration officials, were conducting random searches of papers.</p> <p>When the bus riders asked local Latinos to join them in rallying outside the sheriff's office, they were told that the inhabitants of Sylva were too scared of retribution to speak out in public. But by the end of the protest, many local residents had come and joined the rally.</p> <p>\"That was a microcosm of this whole bus tour is about,\" said one of the organisers, Marisa Franco. \"It's about taking the risk and showing that speaking out is more effective than hiding in the shadows.\"</p> <p>Natally Cruz, one of the riders, said that when she first joined the bus she was frightened about what would happen to her. Now 25, she came to Arizona from Mexico when she was eight years old and has lived there without authorisation ever since.</p> <p>She will be applying for deferred action under President Obama's new executive order that will allow young Latinos aged 15 to 30 who are studying in college to postpone any threat of deportation for two years and gain work permits. She is grateful to Obama for that, but calls on the president to extend the reform to include older members of her family, six of whom who have faced deportation and one of whom is currently in detention.</p> <p>She recalls the moment she joined the first sit-down protest at the start of the bus ride. \"I was scared of what they would do to me. But once I sat down and started to shout out I felt a great surge of energy \u2013 it was like a heavy stone I'd been carrying on my back had been lifted off me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Our boys were in white, Argentina in navy blue. Much was expected of the totemic No7 if qualification from a tense group stage was to be sealed. It was not Sapporo 2002 but the Riverbank Arena at London 2012, watching the captain, David Clarke, inspire Britain's blind five-a-side football team against a very familiar foe.</p> <p>After a barnstorming opening 15 minutes from the Argentinians, Britain asserted control. But a tight match of few chances failed to yield a winner and finished goalless. Dave Clarke's five will go into the final group match against Iran, who went out of the competition after losing 2-0 on Sunday to Spain but displayed enough flashes of brilliance to suggest they will pose a threat. \"We've never taken a point off Argentina in the 16 years I've been playing them. It's a brilliant feeling to have caught them up and caused them some issues today. We're very happy with a point,\" said Clarke, who yearns for a Paralympic medal to cap a career that has yielded 127 goals and taken in five World Cups.</p> <p>Argentina's coach Martin Demonte was disappointed: \"Obviously we wanted to win to secure our place in the next round. Great Britain are a great team and they have done a lot of work obviously and their work contributed to that result.\"</p> <p>After 10 minutes the British guide \u2013 who stands behind the opposition goal to yell instruction \u2013 shouted: \"This isn't good enough guys.\" It is one of the side effects of the need to remain silent during play, punctuated by cheers and yells whenever the ball leaves the pitch, that you can hear the admonishments of coaches and players.</p> <p>Clarke, winning his 141st cap, admitted afterwards that the opening quarter of an hour was poor, with Lucas Rodr\u00edguez and the captain, Silvio Velo, causing particular problems. \"I felt like a rabbit on three legs, every time I tried to turn one way they went the other,\" he said. But Britain's coach, Tony Larkin, took advantage of the limitless substitutions to bring on the midfielder Robin Williams for Daniel English and Darren Harris for Clarke, who described the changes afterwards as \"brilliant\".</p> <p>Instructed to press higher up the pitch, the British side slowly took control and squeezed the life out of their opponents. Argentina's best chance came from the penalty spot \u2013 one of four on the pitch. Once three fouls have been committed during a 25-minute half, the next triggers a penalty from a mark slightly further from the goal than the regular penalty spot.</p> <p>Velo, who was about to take the kick, was substituted in favour of Luis Sacayan, a specialist penalty taker, who duly missed. Sporting as the crowd were trying to be, they could not resist cheering when he sent it wide.</p> <p>If Argentina started with fluid attacking play, requiring a fine early save from the sighted goalkeeper Dan James, the stereotypes were carried through to the formations. Great Britain started with three defenders on the pitch and a lone striker. Argentina started with one man in defence, two diminutive, tricky midfielders and Velo up front.</p> <p>Blind football can be a brutal game. Tacklers are required to shout \"voy\" to warn their opponent of their direction of approach, but player after player ended up on the brightblue astroturf. Clattering into the boards, Rodr\u00edguez was spectacularly taken out after 14 minutes by Clarke. The favour was returned with interest just after half-time when English was led from the field with blood streaming from his nose.</p> <p>Great Britain turned the screw in the second half but, despite having the territorial advantage, were unable to make the breakthrough. Perhaps the best chance came via a sudden yell from James of \"David, middle, now\", a long throw and a chance that Clarke narrowly failed to convert. In response Argentina's forward, David Peralta, cut across the British defence and flashed a shot just wide of James's left-hand post.</p> <p>The guide plays a crucial role, standing behind the opposition goal, shouting and tapping the post to give the players a sense of where it is. In earlier matches the guides from Iran and China were booked for getting too carried away. But the goalkeeper, too, must spend most of the match yelling at his players, getting them into position and warning them of impending danger.</p> <p>James, formerly on Exeter City's books, met his blind team-mate Keryn Seal six years ago at his local gym and began playing the game. Seal was perhaps the best British player on show, spending the entire match on the pitch and seizing control of the midfield. James's was the dominant voice, cajoling and berating those in front of him in a West Country burr. \"It's all about the tone you use. You're trying to give as much information in as little amount of time as possible,\" he said.</p> <p>While much is familiar, some of the normal rules of watching football are inverted. Stunning close control and spectacular dribbling are par for the course, with Zinedine Zidane style \"roulettes\" a particular favourite. Almost as soon as they receive the ball, players are surrounded by two or three opponents and must work their way out of the tightest of corners.</p> <p>The weighted ball with a rattle inside spends 95% of the time on the floor. Long balls are a rarity and a defence-splitting pass on to the boards that enclose either side of the pitch is one of the tactics that can yield success. Union flags fluttered and whole families in their matching Team GB leisurewear screamed themselves hoarse at the finish, which set up a traditionally nervy final encounter with Iran.</p> <p>Clarke may be on the verge of retirement but he paid tribute to the performances of Lee Brunton and Roy Turnham, younger players who have come through the blind football academy in Herefordshire, as evidence of a bright future.First, though, he wants that medal - and that means beating Iran on Tuesday. \"I can't tell you how much the guys want to get this semi-final place. We may not be full time professionals but we act like it,\" said the 41-year-old. \"We are absolutely determined to make it. The support from the British people, in person and on Twitter, is just incredible. The spirit, the number of people, the enthusiasm. Great Britain has really bought into this and the support is just unbelievable.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Horizon: How Small Is the Universe?</strong><br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Following on from last week's How Big Is The Universe?, tonight's Horizon documents the quest to discover the most minuscule objects lurking in the infinite wilderness. The programme hears from scientists looking to uncover multiple dimensions and evidence of parallel universes. Novelist Peter De Vries once suggested that the universe is like a safe to which there is a combination, but the combination is locked in the safe. Lucky for us, then, that cosmologists are so determined to crack the cosmic strongbox. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>A Mother's Son</strong><br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>Struggling through reed beds, and bleeding from a fatal wound, a teenager is in distress. \"I'm sorry,\" she says. Curious last words. So begins a psychological drama that, initially at least, spins around the issue of whether mother Rosie (Hermione Norris) can trust her own child, Jamie (Alexander Arnold). Underpinning a sense of things not being quite as they appear, Rosie's family is uneasily fused with that of her new partner Ben (Martin Clunes). Worth a look, though suspending disbelief may help at points.

This week, bumptious community leader Mr Khan (co-writer Adil Ray) plans a networking meeting with local businessmen. First, however, he must take his 80-year-old mother-in-law on a predictably fraught shopping trip. As per, the show combines old-fashioned sitcom pratfalls with telling satire: \"I'm not an immigrant!\" blusters Khan. \"Immigrants are eastern Europeans, coming over here and taking the jobs from Pakistanis.\" <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>The Treasures Of Ancient Rome</strong><br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Certain statements have become so ubiquitous, it's easy to overlook how much they shrivel under even a cursory inspection: \"There are no second acts in American lives\"; \"The Romans didn't do art\". In the first part of this new series, Alastair Sooke sets out to debunk the latter, explaining how the Romans pioneered a new realism in sculpture (perfecting \"the inner workings of the mind through an understanding of physiognomy\" as Antony Gormley says), while the emperor Augustus used art to build an empire. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2><strong>Ross Kemp: Extreme World</strong><br>9pm, Sky1</h2> <p>In the first of a new series, Kemp and his flak jacket visit Karachi, Pakistan, where a voluntary ambulance corps is already on to its third cemetery.

  "<p>David Cameron is to embark on a major reshuffle of his government at all ranks, from cabinet members to lowly junior ministers, in an attempt to rejuvenate the coalition as it struggles to kickstart the economy.</p> <p>As MPs prepared to return to parliament on Monday for two weeks before the party conferences start, the prime minister was finalising plans for a much wider than expected reshuffle to put in place the main ministers for the second half of the parliament in the runup to the general election.</p> <p>Cameron is expected to embark on his first big reshuffle, possibly tomorrow, to allow voters to digest a series of policy announcements over the weekend that were designed to show the government was redoubling its efforts to promote economic growth.</p> <p>In a sign of how the Tories are prepared to rethink strategy, as the economy struggles to break out of a double-dip recession, George Osborne announced that he now supported an extra runway in the south-east of England, possibly at Heathrow .</p> <p>\"We need more runway capacity in the south-east of England,\" the chancellor told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1.</p> <p>The Tories have agreed with the Liberal Democrats to set up a commission to try to broker a cross-party agreement on a new runway that would be built after the next election. This is designed to ensure coalition unity \u2013 and unity within the Conservative party for the moment \u2013 and to give the Tories the option of going into the next election with a pledge to build a third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>As David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2196870/DAVID-CAMERON-Hard-work-moral-good-dumbing--It-time-stop-dithering-thats-holding-Britain-back.html\" title=\"\">declared in a Mail on Sunday article</a> that the government had more to do to make Britain more competitive, Osborne announced the government would:</p> <p>\u2022 Guarantee \u00a340bn in infrastructure projects and \u00a310bn in housing developments. A bill on this will be rushed out in the next few days with a view to it entering the statute books next month.</p> <p>\u2022 Create a small business bank to beef up lending to small enterprises.</p> <p>\u2022 Speed up planning with a new economic development bill \u2013 including raising the possibility of building on green belt land.</p> <p>In his BBC interview, Osborne brushed off questions about the reshuffle. \"You can ask David Cameron about the reshuffle,\" the chancellor said. \"I'm absolutely clear that the economic team in the government, which starts with the first lord of the Treasury, [the prime minister], is totally focused over the coming months on getting the economy moving.\"</p> <p>But Osborne is one of a handful of people intimately involved in the changes. All the main figures in the cabinet \u2013 Osborne, William Hague and Theresa May \u2013 are expected to remain in their posts. The prime minister is said to be resisting pressure from some Tories to do a job swap between Osborne, the most unpopular member of the government, and Hague, who is more popular.</p> <p>But there will be other departures at all levels. Kenneth Clarke, 72, has been fighting hard against plans to demote him from his post as justice secretary to replace Sir George Young as leader of the House of Commons. Clarke has been a continuous presence on the Conservative government frontbench since 1972.</p> <p>Cheryl Gillan, 60, the Welsh secretary who is strongly opposed to the high-speed rail link that is due to pass through her Chesham and Amersham constituency, is expected to return to the backbenches. Maria Miller, the minister for the disabled, Chris Grayling, the employment minister, and Grant Shapps, the housing minister, are all being tipped for promotion.</p> <p>The former Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the treasury David Laws will return to the government. Nick Clegg told the Guardian last week that he would like Laws to advise him on economic policy and on early intervention for toddlers in an attempt to prevent social problems and disadvantage later in people's lives. It had been thought that Laws would work alongside Oliver Letwin in the Cabinet Office policy \"engine room\".</p> <p>This is now looking less likely because it would mean creating an extra Lib Dem ministerial post.</p> <p>Laws could instead become a minister in the education department and have an informal role across government.</p> <p>Government sources are indicating the shakeup, which is expected to focus mainly on the Tory side of the government, will be more than \"tinkering\". One government source said: \"David has deliberately waited until pretty much the midway point of the parliament before embarking on this reshuffle because he wanted ministers to bed down. But now it is time to make changes.</p> <p>\"The reshuffle will be much more wide ranging than people think. This is not so much about putting the election fighting team in place. It is more about putting in place the strongest government for the second half of this parliament.\"</p> <p>The prime minister wants to embark on the reshuffle in the first week of the two week-long pre-conference parliamentary session, which begins on Monday. But he is understood to want to wait until Tuesday to ensure voters focus on the growth announcements outlined by Osborne.</p> <p>A new bill, to be published this week with the aim of turning it into law by next month, will allow the government to use Britain's low borrowing rates to guarantee the \u00a340bn in infrastructure projects and \u00a310bn for underwriting housing projects.</p> <p>This is designed to answer Labour calls for increased borrowing to boost demand on the grounds that the government's tough deficit reduction plan has created low borrowing costs which, in turn, allow the government to increase the amount it can use to underwrite projects.</p> <p>Infrastructure projects will take longer to implement. But the \u00a310bn in housing guarantees could be implemented quickly, providing much needed housing and helping to boost demand.</p> <p>The small business bank is designed to complement other government initiatives such as the enterprise finance guarantee. But ministers hope that it will improve lending to small and medium sized enterprises in the way that the Small Business Administration does in the US and the KFW Bank does in Germany.</p> <p>The new economic development bill is designed to speed up planning. \"We need to cut through the thicket of red tape,\" one source said.</p> <p>In a nod to traditionalists, who fear that the green belt will be covered in concrete, the government will not revisit its National Planning Policy. Existing powers will be used to allow developments on \"brownfield sites\" in the green belt in return for designating countryside outside the green belt.</p>",
  "<p>Santi Cazorla offers a two-footed, subtly skilful rebuke to those critics who claim Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has lost his touch in the transfer market . Equally importantly, a creator described as a cross between Liam Brady and Cesc F\u00e1bregas appears sufficiently talented to serve as an on-field airbrush, smoothing out the imperfections in other areas of Arsenal's class of 2012-13.</p> <p>Admittedly the impressive Abou Diaby enjoyed a key ball-winning role for the visitors but Wenger's \u00a312m acquisition from Mal\u00e1ga created Arsenal's first goal before scoring the second himself. It was Cazorla, deployed in a central role behind Olivier Giroud in a 4-2-3-1 formation, whose smart link play enabled his new side to dominate possession and control the tempo for prolonged periods.</p> <p>Far too brainy to be cowed by Liverpool's embryonic pressing game, he ensured that what the home manager, Brendan Rodgers, terms as the \"transition\" \u2013 the phase of play when his side are striving to reclaim the ball \u2013 was frequently considerably longer than intended.</p> <p>Like Rodgers, Wenger is a \"conviction coach\" who, refusing to have truck with the pragmatic tactics and \"consensus\" politics of many managerial peers, sticks to his slick passing, sensible spending principles come rain or shine.</p> <p>As the trophy-less years have accumulated, Arsenal's manager has sometimes seemed a bit of a prophet in the wilderness but, much more of this, and his cynics may start revising some gloomy pre-season predictions.</p> <p>Certainly watching the impressive Lukas Podolski \u2013 all intelligent, diligent, running in a wide-left role \u2013 meet Cazorla's clever pass before scoring his side's first goal of this Premier League campaign, Wenger must have suddenly felt reassuringly warmed by Anfield's weak afternoon sunshine.</p> <p>The pain inflicted by the loss of F\u00e1bregas and, more recently, Robin van Persie \u2013 not to mention Nuri Sahin's decision to join Liverpool on loan from Real Madrid \u2013 was temporarily at least diminished by his new 5ft 6in Spaniard.</p> <p>\"We saw very quickly that Cazorla was not going to take six months to settle,\" Wenger said. \"And we know Podolski is deadly when he gets a chance.\" Blessed with what coaches call \"soft feet\" \u2013 because they cushion and caress the ball so well \u2013 and sharp vision, the former is the sort of player fans struggle to take their eyes off.</p> <p>From Giroud's viewpoint this could only be a good thing. Long before Cazorla had assuaged Wenger's anxieties \u2013 not to mention ruined Jos\u00e9 Reina's afternoon \u2013 by scoring Arsenal's second goal, their lone striker had appeared a weak link.</p> <p>It is all very well boasting a remodelled defence which has gone three games without conceding, but memories of Van Persie will keep rearing their head if the ball persists in bouncing off Giroud like this. Forget the glorious first-half chance missed by the French forward, if only his hold up play had been a bit better much good work from Cazorla, Diaby and Mikel Arteta would have reaped even greater dividends.</p> <p>These are, of course, early days and expectations are, as Wenger puts it, very high. Giroud must be given a decent chance to adapt to a new football culture but it is impossible to resist the thought that a move for Andy Carroll on Arsenal's part last week might not have been quite as left-field as it sounds. Alan Pardew, Newcastle United's manager, sees shades of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the England centre-forward and what better habitat in which to coax them out of him than The Emirates?</p> <p>While Liverpool loaned Carroll to West Ham, Arsenal twice attempted to sign Yohan Cabaye from Newcastle before the transfer window's closure but Wenger surely did not need the France playmaker. Indeed, with Jack Wilshere scheduled to make his long awaited return from ankle and knee injuries next month, midfield looks the Gunners' strong suit. Here it was sufficiently rich for Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott to be named as substitutes while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's frequent struggles to get beyond Jos\u00e9 Enrique barely mattered.</p> <p>\"There's quality and a fight for places in our midfield,\" said Wenger, \"and Wilshere's looking very good in training.\"</p> <p>Carl Jenkinson's encouraging emergence at right-back \u2013 even if Raheem Sterling did give him a couple of frights \u2013 has helped ensure that a defence protected by Vito Mannone, Arsenal's third-choice goalkeeper, also appears a more robust department than expected.</p> <p>\"It's encouraging,\" Wenger said. \"It's early and football often offers lessons in humility but I'm confident we have good potential.\"</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, the manager who forecast the Eurozone crisis before many politicians and economists is finally poised to remind everyone that football clubs can occasionally win trophies <em>and </em>make money.</p>",
  "<p>Congratulations to Allyson Pollock for her relentless campaign against the destruction of the NHS by the government (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/27/nhs-privatisation-toxic-world-healthcare\" title=\"\">The toxic world of globalised healthcare</a>, 28 August). Many people do not realise what an extraordinary service it was. Not only did it offer unlimited care to everyone without charging more to those who used it most, which no private organisation could ever do, but its consultants offered patients genuinely impartial advice on what treatment would be best, rather than recommending the treatment which would make them the most money.</p> <p>Patients are the most vulnerable consumers in the world, given that they cannot possibly evaluate what treatment they really need for themselves in such fast-moving and highly technical fields such as medicine and surgery. By the same token they are ripe for exploitation by commercial companies, which is why healthcare costs as a proportion of GDP are so much higher in the US than here, despite the fact that only very basic treatment is available over there to those who cannot pay.</p> <p>It would be far better for us to keep the NHS and restrict the range of treatments available, using recommendations by Nice as a basis for national decision-making rather than to marketise the service and tell patients that they must pay for anything the NHS \"cannot afford\", which is obviously the thin end of a wedge. Live-now-pay-later schemes such as PFI merely transfer costs, plus profits for the firms involved, to future generations and are similarly a national disgrace.<br><strong>Dr Richard Turner</strong><br><em>Harrogate, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Geographical disparity in medicines and treatments will only get worse now the Andrew Lansley health bill has become law. Your report (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/28/scorecards-nhs-inequality-over-drugs\" title=\"\">'Scorecards' to end inequality over NHS drugs</a>, 28 August) describes how currently it is up to primary care trusts across the country to decide when to permit access to new and/or expensive drugs. Once clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) take over completely next April, it will be up to them to make these decisions. CCGs are \"local doctor\"-led and it is they who will&#xa0;control usage and expenditure (both in their own prescribing in primary care and in their commissioning of treatment by hospitals).</p> <p>There is thus an inherent conflict of interest (making clinical decisions while at the same time controlling treatment budgets) operating in the new arrangements. At least PCTs had some neutrality in their decision-making. The only way to tackle the problem of variations in CCG expenditure on new medicines now will be for the centre to intervene \u2013 hence the \"scorecards\" that the Department of Health says it intends to introduce. The centre rules yet again despite Lansley's avowed intention to devolve power to doctors at the frontline. Some of us predicted this months ago.<br><strong>Gillian Dalley</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008It is good that the new chair of the BMA is opposed to Lansley's so-called reforms of the NHS in England (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/bma-leader-nhs-privatisation\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 1 September), but the time is soon coming when BMA members must put their money where their mouths are. Through their role in the new CCGs, doctors have a unique opportunity to shape the NHS and keep it public.</p> <p>There are some simple guidelines for them to follow. Do not accept into CCG membership any doctor who has a direct interest in a private health firm or out-of-hours service. Do not use any private firm or consultancy in running the CCG. Do not contract for the provision of services with any private medical firm or social enterprise.

  "<p>I was driving recently when a strangled gurgle erupted from the rear seat, where my eight-month-old daughter Esme might have been choking to death. This guttural \"uurrrgh-blurrgh\" continued for a heart-stopping second before she returned to her happy \"ah-ba-ba-ba\" song but I was shaken up&#xa0;by the incident to the extent that I&#xa0;signed up for a first aid course.</p> <p>For many of us, first aid knowledge is a bit like our recall of amazing scientific facts down the pub \u2013 bewilderingly vague. I never really gave my ignorance a second thought until I realised that as&#xa0;a father of twins it would be horrific if something went wrong and I couldn't do anything about it.</p> <p>Above the sinks in the Red Cross Norwich centre's toilets is a helpful guide to washing your hands \u2013 in 11 steps. Thankfully, the charity's<a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/What-we-do/First-aid/Children-first-aid/\" title=\"\"> first aid for babies and children</a> is not nearly so complicated. Attending the training day with me are nine others, including four young teachers and a grandmother. Our topics of study are every parent's worst nightmare: bleeding, embedded objects, burns, sprains and strains (phew, a benign one), fractures, raised temperatures, seizures, meningitis, severe allergic reactions, head injuries, swallowing harmful substances, vomiting and diarrhoea.</p> <p>We begin with the building blocks: checking for breathing, the recovery or&#xa0;\"safe position\" and, if they are not breathing, baby CPR. Red Cross trainers say that those memorable <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Vinnie Jones CPR ads</a> for the British Heart Foundation, as well as footballer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/15/fabrice-muamba-bolton-retirement-football\" title=\"\">Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest</a>, have raised an awareness of <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Accidents-and-first-aid/Pages/CPR.aspx\" title=\"\">cardiopulmonary resuscitation</a>, but the technique is different for children under a year old.</p> <p>The eerie training mannequins \u2013 dolls and torsos of young children \u2013 are officially known as Resusci Annies, but our Red Cross trainer, Diana MacDonald-Steele, refers to them as Tommy. First we have to call Tommy's name, tap his feet and put our cheek to his mouth to see if he is breathing. If so, the \"safe position\" is to hold him close to you in a cuddle but keeping his head lower than his bottom. If he is not breathing, we must begin CPR by tilting back the head with one finger on his chin as if he is \"sniffing the air\", as MacDonald-Steele puts it, to ensure his airways are clear, and then begin CPR with five one-second \"rescue breaths\", putting our mouths over his mouth and nose.</p> <p>\"You've got to think you are huffing on a window,\" says MacDonald-Steele, as we hunch over our prone babies, which have plastic tubes to send our breath into their chests. After the rescue breaths, we quickly place two fingers on Tommy's chest and give 30 firm compressions at the rate of two a second. Then we give two more rescue breaths, and repeat this cycle three times, continuing until the medics arrive. With older children, the process is the same but we must pinch their nose and huff into their mouth, and the compressions are done with a firm hand rather than two fingers.</p> <p>First aid classes at school passed me by and, embarrassingly, I can't recall exactly how to put a child or an adult into the <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Accidents-and-first-aid/Pages/The-recovery-position.aspx\" title=\"\">recovery position</a>. \"Wave-prayer-pockets-knee\" is how MacDonald-Steele encourages us to remember. \"If&#xa0;you leave them on their back, you leave them to die,\" she says. It suddenly strikes me how banal the difference between life and death is.</p> <p>Choking is probably every new parent's most common anxiety, especially when Esme's twin Camilla shoves everything from soil to remote controls into her dainty mouth. I put Tommy over my knees, holding his jaw between thumb and forefinger, and give him five tentative taps on the back. MacDonald-Steele reminds us that this is one of the most resilient parts of the body, and what's a bit of bruising when a life is at stake? Ninety-nine per cent of the time, five back blows will dislodge the choking object, says our trainer. If not, we must turn Tommy on his back with his head lower than his bottom and perform five chest thrusts, a bit like CPR but with the fingers directed up to the throat.</p> <p>Head injuries must be a close second to choking. \"If you took a child to hospital every time they banged their heads, you'd move in there,\" says MacDonald-Steele. There's no magic rule: we're told to sit the injured person down with a cold compress and monitor them for signs of potential internal damage include drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, fluid in ears or nose and&#xa0;dilated pupils.</p> <p>As we are whisked through these demonstrations, it becomes obvious that this stuff is easy to remember and, like the best philosophy, all fits together. Old myths die hard, however. \"My mother used to put butter on my burns,\" says MacDonald-Steele, rolling her eyes. These days, there's one clear rule: put the burnt bit under a cold tap for a full 10 minutes \u2013 not 30 seconds. Burns don't need creams but should be gently wrapped in clingfilm.</p> <p>Other changes to old-fashioned wisdom include never inducing vomiting if a child has swallowed a toxic substance (doing nothing except calling for medical help is the best thing to do), and never tilting the head backwards to stop a nosebleed: instead, tip the head forwards, pinching the soft end of the nose, and releasing to check for bleeding every 10&#xa0;minutes. After 30&#xa0;minutes of bleeding, call for help.</p> <p>\"Never be afraid to dial 999,\" says MacDonald-Steele. \"First aiders shouldn't go beyond their limitations \u2013 no <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Tracheostomy/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">tracheostomies</a> with Biros, you know what I mean?\"</p> <p>I know what she means.

  "<p>Britain has allowed key members of Egypt's toppled dictatorship to retain millions of pounds of suspected property and business assets in the UK, potentially violating a globally-agreed set of sanctions.</p> <p>The situation has led to accusations that ministers are more interested in preserving the City of London's cosy relationship with the Arab financial sector than in securing justice.</p> <p>Hosni Mubarak, the ousted former president, was sentenced to life in jail in June. A six-month investigation, conducted by BBC Arabic and released in conjunction with the Guardian and al-Hayat, a pan-Arab newspaper, has identified many valuable assets linked to his family and their associates that have not been frozen.</p> <p>These include luxury houses in Chelsea and Knightsbridge and companies registered in central London. One member of Mubarak's inner circle has even been permitted to set up a UK-based business in recent months, despite being named on a <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/public_notice_egypt_220311.pdf\" title=\"\">British Treasury sanctions list</a> (pdf) of Egyptians who are linked to misappropriated assets and subject to an asset-freeze.</p> <p>In response to the investigation, the Foreign Office said it was working closely with its Egyptian counterparts to hunt down Mubarak regime assets. The Treasury, which has a dedicated unit tasked with implementing financial sanctions, said it was confident it had acted properly. Both departments said they could not comment on individual cases.</p> <p>The revelations will embarrass British ministers, who have previously expressed support for the Arab uprisings and vowed to take \"decisive action\" to track down and return illicit funds taken out of Egypt.</p> <p>Yet 18 months on from the downfall of Mubarak, publicly-accessible records from Companies House and Land Registry indicate that the fortunes of regime figures convicted of embezzling money from Egypt remain at least partially on UK soil and untouched by British authorities.</p> <p>The problem is compounded by the apparent lack of political will in Egypt when it comes to chasing former regime assets \u2013 a situation which some experts attribute to the continued influence of major players from the Mubarak era.</p> <p>Egypt's government is currently pursuing a lawsuit against the UK Treasury for dragging its heels on asset recovery.</p> <p>\"This is a collective crime from both the British and Egyptian governments,\" said Dr Mohamed Mahsoob, a public investigator who led enquiries into Egypt's \"stolen billions\" and who has since been appointed to the country's new cabinet.</p> <p>\"The UK is one of the worst countries when it comes to tracing and freezing Egyptian assets,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The British are saying that they need official requests from the Egyptian government before they take any action and that until this happens they are allowing the free movement of assets and the closure of certain accounts of companies beyond UK borders, to be reinvested elsewhere under different guises in order to prevent it from being retrieved.</p> <p>\"This is pure political profiteering that doesn't reflect the concept of British justice and democracy that we teach in Egyptian universities.</p> <p>\"The UK is doing nothing less than bleeding Egyptian assets, which can only be to the detriment of the Egyptian nation.\"</p> <p>An aggressive free-market reform programme instituted by the Mubarak regime in the 1990s and 2000s saw previously state-owned companies and landholdings shift into the hands of private businessmen at an astonishing rate. Prominent \"big sharks\" within the ruling NDP party \u2013 including Mubarak's playboy son and assumed successor Gamal \u2013 amassed huge riches. Popular anger with the scale of corruption was a driving force behind Egypt's revolution.</p> <p>As political shockwaves from Egypt's upheaval spread throughout the region, Britain's political leaders scrambled to realign themselves with the revolutionaries.</p> <p>David Cameron declared that the UK government was a friend of the Egyptian people and ready to \"help in any way we can\".</p> <p>Three days after Mubarak's downfall, with popular pressure to recover Egypt's 'stolen billions' mounting in the street, the interim government in Cairo requested that western authorities freeze the assets of several former regime members who were suspected of embezzling public funds and hiding them in property and business interests.</p> <p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, told MPs the request would be co-operated with, and government ministers promised \"firm, decisive and prompt action\".</p> <p>Yet although Switzerland took only half an hour to begin freezing Egyptian regime assets following Mubarak's overthrow, the UK took 37 days to follow suit \u2013 a delay which critics say could have allowed assets to be liquidated and illicit funds to be moved offshore.</p> <p>And while Switzerland has frozen almost \u00a3500m of suspect Egyptian assets, the UK has frozen less than a fifth of that and returned none of it to Egypt.</p> <p>Meanwhile nearly half of Egypt's population lives below the poverty line, and the country's government has just requested a controversial \u00a33bn loan from the IMF to help stabilise its economy.</p> <p>Professor Mark Pieth, one of the world's leading authorities on cross-border asset recovery, said the revelations were not surprising.</p> <p>\"As a citizen I would be outraged,\" he told the BBC. \"But as a lawyer I would say it doesn't astonish me that much because I'm not sure that the rules on so-called PEPs [Politically Exposed People] are really fully implemented in the UK. The state is not bending over backwards yet to help.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Egypt had a strong relationship to the west, and quite a strong relationship to the UK for that matter.</p> <p>\"I'm thinking especially of all sorts of Arab banks with their subsidiaries in the City of London. If you go for a walk in the City you can see them \u2013 I'm pretty sure that Egyptian cronies of the Mubarak family and members of that system felt quite comfortable depositing money in the UK.</p> <p>\"It's probably cosier to bring your money to your friends at an Arab bank in the City of London.</p> <p>\"[For the British government] Egypt's military generals are probably still a guarantor for safety whereas the new parliament and the new president are probably looked on with reservation.</p> <p>\"I would expect Britain is careful not to squarely go against the remnants of the old regime.\"</p> <p>Public records show a number of apparently unfrozen UK-based assets linked to Egyptian regime figures, some of whom are now in jail in Cairo for economic fraud. Gamal Mubarak was on a list published by the Treasury in March 2011 detailing 19 Egyptians whose assets were to be frozen.</p> <p>Yet MedInvest Associates, a London-based investment firm of which Gamal was a director, has never been frozen. Gamal subsequently stepped down as director and in February MedInvest was quietly dissolved voluntarily, potentially allowing its assets to be transferred abroad beyond the reach of investigators.</p> <p>Gamal Mubarak is also heavily linked with a \u00a310m London home round the corner from Harrods department store.</p> <p>The Knightsbridge house is named as Mubarak's place of address in his company filings for MedInvest and listed as the Mubarak family home on the birth certificate of Gamal's daughter, born in London in 2010.</p> <p>But the property has not been frozen for investigation. Gamal is now in jail in Cairo, awaiting verdict on money laundering charges.</p> <p>Another figure on the Treasury's sanctions list has actually been allowed to open a new business in the UK. Naglaa el-Ghazarley, wife of former tourism and housing minister Ahmed el-Maghrabi \u2013 now serving a five-year jail sentence in Egypt for corruption \u2013 registered Essential Designs by Nejla last November, almost eight months after the UK promised to freeze her assets.</p> <p>The company's registered address in Chelsea also remains unfrozen. Tim Daniel, a lawyer specialising in asset recovery, said it was \"extraordinary\" that someone on the sanctions list could begin trading in the UK in this way.</p> <p>Judge Assem el-Gohari, the official in Egypt's ministry of justice responsible for tracing stolen funds, insists that he has challenged the UK authorities over their inaction, but was told in response that British investigators need more information to proceed.</p> <p>\"The British government is obliged by law to help us but it doesn't want to make any effort at all to recover the money.

It is simply not possible for the UK to deprive a person of their assets and return them to an overseas country in the absence of a criminal conviction and confiscation order.</p> <p>\"We are therefore working closely with the appropriate authorities in Egypt to help them understand the legal process and how to work with it effectively and efficiently, including through expert-to-expert contacts in the UK and Cairo, the signing of a memorandum of understanding on intelligence sharing with the Egyptian financial intelligence unit, and increased police-to-police intelligence co-operation.\"</p> <p>Andy Slaughter, the shadow justice minister, said the evidence unearthed by the investigation showed that the UK government is \"effectively turning a blind eye\" to money stolen from the Egyptian people.</p> <p>\"Twenty minutes work by officials could have identified very substantial assets belonging to the old Egyptian regime.

  "<p>Oh I see, <em>that</em>'s the secret. There was a warning on the BBC previews website where I watch programmes in advance: keep the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0\" title=\"\"><strong>Doctor Who</strong></a> (BBC1, Saturday) secret until transmission or suffer the consequences (extermination by Dalek,&#xa0;I&#xa0;imagine). It's the Doctor's new companion. We totally knew it was her, though, nice Jenna-Louise Coleman off Emmerdale, didn't we? But we weren't expecting her arrival until Christmas. Steven Moffat, who wrote this episode himself, has pulled a fast one, sprung Christmas \u2013 well, her \u2013 on us early.</p> <p>Crucially, there's an overlap. Naughty Doctor. Remember when you were still in the dating game and the next one was already lined up before the last one was completely over? (I&#xa0;was always the last one, if I'm honest.) Well, Amy Pond \u2013 Karen Gillan \u2013 is still very much around. And I'm pretty sure I still have feelings for her. Not hapless, hopeless Rory, he can go (via Dalek, Weeping Angel, who cares?). But I've always carried a sonic screwdriver for Amy Pond. Billie Piper too, seeing as this seems to be honesty time.</p> <p>What about this Clara Oswin girl \u2013 the character Coleman plays \u2013 then? Well, she is undeniably rather lovely, in her red dress. In distress too, imprisoned alone on the Asylum of the Daleks, a&#xa0;dumping-ground planet to which the&#xa0;Doctor's mortal enemies send the psychotic and insane among them. Can&#xa0;there be anything scarier than a&#xa0;million mad Daleks?</p> <p>Oswin deals with what looks like a&#xa0;hopeless situation practically \u2013 by boarding up the doors, hacking into the&#xa0;Daleks' systems, and blasting out Carmen. Like it. She doesn't just know shit about computers, she's classy. You&#xa0;wouldn't catch Amy Pond listening to Bizet, would you? Never mind Doctor Who; I'm beginning to think Amy Who?</p> <p>Plus Oswin is a domestic goddess too: she bakes. The Mary Berry effect has reached even the Asylum of the Daleks. Souffl\u00e9s, mmmm. Oh, it's burnt, well she can work on that. And the souffl\u00e9 is mainly an elaborate and roundabout way for Moffat to shoehorn a laboured pun in. Eggs terminate. Pfff. Eggs actly.</p> <p>The laboured pun \u2013 yeah, like I can talk! \u2013 and the exciting new arrival aside, this is a lovely episode, overflowing with Moffatism and, well, Doctor Who-ness. It fizzes along, sparkling with life, warmth and wit. It&#xa0;looks good (love the Parliament of Daleks). It's scary \u2013 <em>quite</em> scary (maybe there is something scarier than a million mad Daleks. I'm thinking those Weeping Angels are. How about two million \u2013 or a billion \u2013 of them?). It's loopy \u2013 how can the Doctor possibly get out of this one \u2026 oh, like that. And because I'm a bit fuddled and firmly in&#xa0;my 40s, I find that a lot of the time I&#xa0;don't understand what the hell is going on. What, so Oswin is a demented Dalek too? Oh, that seems a pity, and how's that going to work out when she gets the side-kick job full-time?</p> <p>The M1A2 Abrams tank, subject of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mn5n6\" title=\"\"><strong>Richard Hammond's Crash Course</strong></a> (BBC2, Sunday), is possibly the nearest thing our own planet has to a Dalek right now, with its big lethal prong and its capacity for killing. Its nickname, too \u2013 Whispering Death \u2013 could easily be the title of an episode of Doctor Who.</p> <p>The Hamster (he did actually use to&#xa0;be Jeremy Clarkson's pet, did you know?) is not so moved by this machine's ability to exterminate human life, though. To him, it's a big boy's toy. 1500 horse power, more than a Formula One car, phwoar; top speed of 45.1mph; 120mm smooth-bore main gun; 240 calibre machine gun \u2026 hey this is like playing Top Trumps. Only it's Richard (I can't quite bring myself to call him the Hamster \u2013 it conjures up Hollywood rumours) who's playing.

  "<p>Mitt Romney failed to achieve a bounce from the Republican convention, according to a poll published Sunday, lifting Democrats' spirits as they arrived in Charlotte for their own gathering.</p> <p>Although Obama's campaign team played down the chances of Obama securing a poll bounce from the Democratic convention, beginning Tuesday, it is privately hoping he can open up a significant lead after months in which the two have been tied in the polls. The White House election is on 6 November.</p> <p>Television coverage of conventions usually guarantees a poll bump, but the Republican convention was disrupted by hurricane Isaac, and the convention itself was relatively subdued.</p> <p>Polls put Romney ahead by two percentage points on Thursday and, after delivering a competent but uninspired speech on Thursday evening, one point on Friday.</p> <p>By yesterday, a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll showed Obama with a narrow lead, 44% to 43%.</p> <p>But Obama faces his own problems this week, with his own convention cut down from four days to three because of a cash shortage, unhappiness among the party's main financial backers \u2013 the unions \u2013 and widespread disillusionment with his presidency.</p> <p>Furthermore, like the Republicans last week, he is facing problems with the weather.</p> <p>Six things to watch for this week:</p> <h2>1. Obama's stadium appearance.</h2> <p>Thunderstorms are forecast for Charlotte this week, which shouldn't be a problem Tuesday and Wednesday when the convention is being held indoors. </p> <p>But the weather could be a problem on Thursday, when Obama is scheduled to end with a rally at the 73,000-seat Bank of America stadium.</p> <p>Bank of America itself is an unfortunate name to be associated with, given the unpopularity of bankers, but the Democrats have yet another problem.</p> <p>The big question is whether Obama still has the drawing power that he had in 2008 to fill the stadium. Republicans question whether he is capable of it, suggesting the stadium smacks of delusions of grandeur, just like the Greek columns backdrop he used for his 2008 Denver convention speech, also in a stadium.</p> <p>The Democratic organisers were unequivocal this weekend, insisting that it will be filled to capacity, and that, in the event of rain, they have a contingency plan.</p> <p>\"We're confident we'll be full,\" Jen Psaki, an Obama spokeswoman, told the Hill magazine. \"We have a great ground operation in North Carolina and we've registered more voters than any other state. Our goal is to leave North Carolina better than we came in.\"</p> <h2>2. Bill Clinton's keynote speech.</h2> <p>Other than Obama's speech formally accepting the party's presidential nomination, the main attraction among the speakers will be Bill Clinton's keynote address on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The former president, still one of the best-loved figures in the Democratic party and one of the best orators in US politics, had harsh words for Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries and caucuses, and he has a tendency to say \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 what he really thinks when questioned by journalists.</p> <p>But the former president is also a party loyalist, meaning he will almost certainly praise Obama. He also has a personal interest in winning over the convention, preparing the ground for another possible run by wife Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>He remains one of the best political orators in the world, and could help lift Democrats who feel Obama has not done enough.</p> <h2>3. Other speakers.</h2> <p>Apart from Clinton, speakers who will attract attention during the week include First Lady Michelle Obama, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, former presidential candidate John Kerry, San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, and, via a video link, former president Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>There will be a lot of media attention around Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida who has switched sides to back Obama. There will be a lot of media interest too in Sandra Fluke, the student denounced as \"a slut\" by conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh when, in testimony to Congress, she spoke about the availability of contraception. She is to deliver a speech from the platform, a chance to highlight differences between the Democrats and Republicans in their approach to women's rights.</p> <p>There is a slot too for Elizabeth Warren, fighting to win back from Republican Scott Brown the Massachusetts senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy. A victory for her could help the Democrats retain senate control.</p> <h2>4. Unions unhappy with North Carolina.</h2> <p>Tampa turned out to be a bad choice for the Republicans, given it was the middle of the hurricane season. Charlotte too is a gamble for the Democrats and, like Tampa, may turn out to be a mistake. The thinking was that North Carolina, though it went to Obama in 2008, was an extremely close race, and that holding the convention in Charlotte would help buttress Democratic chances in November.</p> <p>Since the decision was made, polls show North Carolina has returned to the Republican fold and is no longer regarded as a toss-up state.</p> <p>Furthermore, Charlotte could be a mistake \u2013 even though it seems to be a more pleasant place to visit than Tampa \u2013 because the decision has angered unions.</p> <p>North Carolina is a 'right-to-work' state, one of those that introduced legislation that severely restricts union rights. The unions have scaled back their involvement in the convention, abandoning most of the rallies, parties, concerts and other events they fund, and only sending small delegations.</p> <p>Richard Trumka, leader of one of the biggest union groups, the AFL-CIO, in a letter to other union officials, wrote: \"We will not be making major monetary contributions to the convention or the host committee for events or activities around the convention.\" The money would be channelled instead to political grassroots activities elsewhere.</p> <h2>5. Disillusionment among party activists.</h2> <p>There is disillusionment too among the party grassroots, where a feeling persists that Obama should have done more during his first term, especially in the first year when the Democrats controlled both the Senate and the House.</p> <p>These activists are disappointed that he has not fulfilled campaign promises such as the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention center.</p> <p>The question this week is how many people are prepared to go out and work for Obama \u2013 knocking on doors, canvassing, and otherwise getting the vote out.</p> <p>The Republicans are banking on more of their base being fired up than that of the Democrats. They might prove right, but it could also be that Democrats will be sufficiently motivated by the prospect of a Romney presidency to come out anyway.</p> <p>Events in Charlotte may help demonstrate how widespread the disaffection is among the party grassroots.</p> <h2>6. Public disenchantment with Obama's presidency.</h2> <p>Beyond avowed Democrats, there is a wider disenchantment among voters. </p> <p>The biggest issue among the electorate is the sluggish economy, with unemployment stuck at just over 8%.</p> <p>No matter how good a week Obama has in Charlotte, the latest unemployment figures come out the morning after his convention speech, and economists are not expecting any major positive change.</p>",
  "<p>This was a clash between two managers who promote a similar brand of football: quick, short passing, clever attacking movement and a high defensive line. But while Liverpool offered possession without penetration and a poor defensive shape, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side were impressive when breaking quickly and admirable in their organisation without the ball.</p> <p>There were two obvious tactical differences between the sides. The first was the level of pressing. Arsenal stood off and focused on getting into an organised shape behind the ball, with two banks of four remaining both narrow and compact, preventing Liverpool playing quick passes through the centre of the pitch.</p> <p>On the other hand, Brendan Rodgers's side were more energetic when out of possession, closing down high up the pitch. Luis Su\u00e1rez started the pressure, using his boundless energy to charge towards Arsenal's defenders on the ball. This was more effective when he closed down the right side of Arsenal's defence \u2013 Carl Jenkinson and Per Mertesacker were less reliable on the ball than Kieran Gibbs and Thomas Vermaelen and Liverpool won the ball high up the pitch, creating some promising situations in the final third early on.</p> <p>The second contrast was the format of the three-man midfields. Brendan Rodgers wanted his trio to be fluid \u2013 Steven Gerrard, Nuri Sahin and Joe Allen could all, in theory, play in any of the three midfield roles and there was plenty of rotation. If one of the players was high up the pitch and could not receive a simple pass, he would drop deeper to collect the ball, and another midfielder would move higher up the pitch in response.</p> <p>Arsenal's trio was more structured. Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby worked as a unit while Santi Cazorla stayed in an advanced position, close to Olivier Giroud. Last week against Stoke, the Spaniard kept dropping deep to help retain possession, which was unnecessary as his role was conflicting with Arteta's. Here he played as more of a classic playmaker.</p> <p>Whereas Liverpool's three midfielders played short passes in front of Arsenal, Cazorla's positioning meant his side could be more incisive and cut through Liverpool's midfield immediately. The nature of the midfields contributed to the opening goal \u2013 Cazorla put himself between the lines and received the ball in space, while Liverpool's midfielders were all high up the pitch. Here, Liverpool missed Lucas Leiva \u2013 the Brazilian is an expert at positioning himself intelligently in that zone, defending the width of the pitch by himself.</p> <p>Cazorla exploited Liverpool's weakness between the lines excellently, and although he was nominally playing in the centre of the pitch, he was especially prominent because of his willingness to move into wider positions to receive the ball in space. He added the second after a run from a central position towards the left, around the outside of the Liverpool central midfielders into a position where no one took responsibility for tracking him.</p> <p>Cazorla first emerged at Villarreal, where he was used as one of the central attacking midfielders in a 4-2-2-2 system, encouraged to create centrally yet also provide width when needed. He has retained that habit for lateral drifts and this will be vital in Arsenal's linkup play this season, helping to form triangles and keep the passing quick and purposeful.</p> <p>The tactical battle barely changed as the game went on; the onus was on Rodgers to transform the match, but his bench was particularly uninspiring. Stewart Downing \u2013 who Rodgers has said may be used at left-back this season \u2013 was the closest to an attacking option. Arsenal's shape remained consistent and they collected their third consecutive clean sheet.</p> <h2>Ferguson searches for right combination</h2> <p>With no central midfielder signed in the transfer window, Sir Alex Ferguson is still trying to find his best combination in the centre of the pitch. In the 3-2 win over Southampton, Tom Cleverley and Michael Carrick were paired together, but both Ferguson and hat-trick hero Robin van Persie acknowledged that the side's performance really improved when Paul Scholes replaced Cleverley after an hour.</p> <p>The Carrick-Scholes combination clearly remains United's best when they're in control of a game, but does it have the necessary battling qualities without the ball? It hasn't been a problem in the past, but there's a more attacking tilt to United's play this season \u2013 with an extra forward deployed on the wing instead of a wide midfielder, and Shinji Kagawa as the No10 with few defensive responsibilities. Carrick and Scholes will increasingly have to win their own battles in the centre of midfield, and playing a physical attacking midfielder against them might be the best approach for opposition coaches.</p> <h2>Van Persie benefits from heading practice</h2> <p>All three of Van Persie's goals came following crosses from wide areas into the penalty box, and Manchester United have played 96 crosses so far this season, more than any other side in the league. Their closest challengers are Newcastle, who have attempted 75.</p> <p>Van Persie's winner was scored with his head, an area of this game he's put effort into improving over the past couple of years. At the start of 2011, realising that his role at Arsenal was now that of an out-and-out striker, Van Persie stayed behind after training each day to practise his heading, making him more of an all-round goalscoring threat and developing a good relationship with Theo Walcott. He's not a player you'd naturally associate with getting on the end of high balls, but his movement across defenders and pure heading technique has become excellent, so Antonio Valencia's old-fashioned touchline-hugging wing play won't go to waste this season.</p>",
  "<p>Housing is at the heart of the economic crisis, and getting housing right will be part of its answer. It is also one of the toughest of political quandaries, one whose obvious answer is so unpalatable that no government has had the courage to face it. The quandary is this: housing costs too much, but for millions of people, security depends on the value of their bricks and mortar.</p> <p>A generation are being <a href=\"http://media.shelter.org.uk/home/press_releases/shelter_appoints_new_trustees/stagnant_economy_will_mean_record_numbers_renting_their_homes\" title=\"\">priced out of homes</a> so that their parents keep the value of their principal asset. It is not surprising that the politicians' solutions \u2013 whether it's the hints this weekend from the<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2196948/Cameron-roars-Im-mouse-launches-battle-plan-revive-ailing-economy.html\" title=\"\"> prime minister</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/george-osborne-deregulation-planning-laws\" title=\"\">chancellor</a> of easier planning laws, or the implementation at the end of last week of a law that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/charities-end-squatters-rights-homelessness\" title=\"\">criminalises squatting</a> \u2013 are little more than populist window dressing that will make no real difference to the fundamental problem. And while attempts to magic a simple answer are rational short-term politics, they risk damaging the prospects of a realistic debate and ultimately a long-term solution.</p> <p>Plainly, more homes are needed, particularly in the south-east. But the reason for the catastrophic decline in the number of new ones being built is not only the tight planning regulations or an overprotected green belt. Builders aren't building on land for which they have planning permission now because they can't sell the houses they've built already. They can't sell the houses because mortgages are still hard to come by and people are still fearful of getting into more debt. So lending is still <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/20/mortgage-lending-up-historically-low\" title=\"\">two-thirds below its 2007 peak</a>. And builders won't bring down their prices because it would compromise their investment in expensive land and expensively built homes.</p> <p>The shortage of homes people can afford means young couples are delaying having children. At the current rate, one in four will be priced out of home ownership by 2025. To fill the gap, the private rented sector is expanding fast. But it needs better, <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/making-institutional-investment-private-rented-sec/\" title=\"\">longer-term tenancy agreements </a>in place if it is to become a valid choice for families, and it needs to find ways \u2013 as the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/aug/23/montague-review-private-investment-rented-housing-cih\" title=\"\">Montague report</a> suggested last month \u2013 of persuading pension funds to invest in the housing market when relatively low profitability makes the idea unattractive.</p> <p>In this context, criminalising squatting can be seen for the irrelevance that it is. It is true that there have been cases of homes left briefly empty for sale or renovation being taken over by squatters. These get <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/youre-putting-my-unborn-baby-at-risk-mothertobe-tells-squatters-6440076.html\" title=\"\">lots of publicity</a> and rightly make people angry and also disproportionately fearful. But it is not hard to prosecute them under the current law (as 160 practitioners pointed out in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/sep/25/squatting-law-media-politicians\" title=\"\">letter </a>on these pages last year). Research from the housing action charity Crisis suggests most people who squat are <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/Crisis_SquattingReport_SEPT2011.pdf\" title=\"\">vulnerable</a> and homeless, and squat because they can see no alternative. It is a welfare and housing issue, not a criminal one. At the same time there are at least 700,000 empty homes in England and Wales. But bringing them back into service is not easy. Most are for sale or awaiting repairs or renovation. Less than a third have been empty for more than six months. Everyone knows this is daft, an affront to those desperate for somewhere to live as well as to those who have to live next door to boarded-up, often vandalised properties, but it is no long-term answer to the housing crisis. Meanwhile, the consequences of policy failure mount up in soaring private-sector rents and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/apr/24/housing-housing-benefit\" title=\"\">cap on housing benefit,</a> plans to sell off high value social housing and reinvigorate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/poll/2011/oct/06/poll-right-to-buy market\" title=\"\">the right to buy</a>.</p> <p>Politicians have to accept there is no quick fix for housing. More than that, there is no obvious, tried and tested route out of the current crisis. Getting it right will take an attitudinal shift. It is no longer possible to leave it to the market. Housing policy cannot be constrained by the desire to maintain and enhance voters' assets, nor the need to protect the construction industry's profits. Nor, important as it is, should it only be about providing jobs. Housing is a public good, and that is how public policy must treat it.</p>",

  "<p>The head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has urged the European Central Bank to start buying bonds of crisis-hit countries again, to help bring down their borrowing costs.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, secretary general of the Paris thinktank, said: \"The ECB should start unlimited bond buying, the sooner the better. It has to be a credible signal \u2026 to say: we have members of the family that are doing the right thing, we will not let you push them around.\"</p> <p>The ECB will meet on Thursday to discuss, among other things, the potential to resume the bond-buying programme.</p> <p>The need to bring down Spain's borrowing costs is becoming increasingly urgent. The heavily indebted country is due to pay back \u20ac15bn next month, but cannot borrow at affordable rates to refinance the debt. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds last week got perilously close to 7%, a level considered unsustainable in the long term. By contrast, the yield on German 10-year debt is 1.3%.</p> <p>The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said at the weekend a monetary union could not function with such a wide gap between the borrowing costs of member states. He too urged the ECB to restart the bond-buying programme but continued to resist calls to seek more financial help.</p> <p>Spain, which has already implemented severe austerity measures in return for up to \u20ac100bn in aid for its banking sector, is reluctant to ask for more as it fears further austerity could push the country into a recessionary spiral. Rajoy said he would await decisions by the ECB and then consider \"what is good for Spain and the euro\", suggesting he will not make any request for further aid before the meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>He said Spain had already done more than other countries in the eurozone to address its budget problems. \"We have raised taxes, reformed our labour market, introduced a fiscal pact into our constitution and passed a law for budget stability.\"</p> <p>The ECB president, Mario Draghi, has been thrashing out a rescue package for Spain this weekend, arguing for purchases of the bonds of struggling member states. Germany opposes such a move, saying it would damage the credibility of the bank and the currency.</p> <p>Reports suggest Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president and Germany's member of the ECB's governing council, repeatedly threatened to resign because of his opposition to a renewed bond-buying programme.</p> <p>\"For me such a policy comes close to financing states with the printing press,\" he said in German newspaper Bild Zeitung. He warned that such a policy \"can get [states] hooked like a drug\".</p> <p>Despite Germany's economic clout within the eurozone, Weidmann has only one vote in the ECB and economists expect confirmation on Thursday that the ECB will restart the bond-buying programme.</p> <p>However, it is thought the announcement may not be enough to galvanise the markets. Analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note: \"We expect the [ECB] to disappoint markets by providing only details about how it might buy bonds in future instead of a grand plan for immediate and massive purchases.\" Previously the ECB has said it will only buy sovereign bonds at the request of a country, and if certain conditions are agreed.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p> </p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Morning all. England have won the toss and will bowl first here at Lord's. It's a wee bit overcast in London and a no-brainer really from Alastair Cook. South Africa make one change to the side that were undone by Eoin Morgan's outstanding 73 at the Oval a few days ago. Ryan McLaren comes in for Morne Morkel, who is rested.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.12am: We're about to get underway here as the players stride onto the hallowed grass. I hope they're more awake than I am \u2013 10.15am start! Good lord it's too early! I wonder what Old Father Time would say about this.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>England:</strong> Cook (c), Bell, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Tredwell, Anderson, Finn, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>South Africa:</strong> Smith, Amla, Duminy, Elgar, de Villiers (c/wk), du Plessis, Peterson, Parnell, Steyn, McLaren, Tsotsobe.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Steve Finn is going to open the bowling from the Pavilion End. Two slips in place...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 6-0 (Smith 6, Amla 0)</strong> The second ball of the day is too full from Finn and Smith, as he has done all series, just pushes it through the leg side field and it runs away for four. The next ball brings a couple for Smith through the off side, a thick outside edge. 12th man is on with a couple of rags, there might be a bit of moisture out there. Michael Holding is aghast that England have not placed Ravi Bopara at square leg instead of extra cover. Think he was a point, to be fair. Finn knocks the bails off accidentally at the bowler's end with his last delivery.</p> <p>Harry Tuttle emails: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Morning James. Bopara and Dernbach the key bowlers today. There's no need to explain why, is there? I wonder if Dernbach will develop into a Test player. Great prospect for limited overs, obviously.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (Smith 6, Amla 4)</strong> Jimmy Anderson has the honour of the second over but his first ball is a sloppy loosener, Amla has a thwack but it doesn't come off the middle and easily fielded. Jimmy's immediately back on target though and gets one to nip away on the seam, Amla has a waft but misses it completely, encouraging for England. They actually managed to get him out at the Oval, can they get him early today? Er, in a word, no. Amla guides the final delivery through the covers with consummate ease. Four runs.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 12-0 (Smith 7, Amla 4)</strong> Tredwell and Trott are the men in the slips, and the latter has to be alert as Smith flashes at a wide-ish ball from Finn, not making proper contact and scuffing it on the bounce. A quick single from the South Africa Test captain next up, he didn't look like he enjoyed that Smith but it's a good run after a forward defensive. Finn sends a short one down the leg side and that's a wide ball, even though it almost clipped off Amla's glove.</p> <p><strong>Gary Naylor:</strong> \"Not sure that this is a day for Dernbach and Ravi's liquorice allsorts. I expect the ball(s) to swing all day and that we'll have two lots of 50 overs Test cricket. 240 might be a good score in these conditions.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 16-0 (Smith 11, Amla 4)</strong> Anderson's line is a bit too straight and Smith gets a couple off the leg side. He moves his feet so quickly and I can't for the life of me understand why England don't move an extra man over to leg. Next up it's a jaffa from Anderson! Just outside of off stump, a low skidder with real pace that Smith misses and Kieswetter claims. And Anderson has Smith squared up trying to play through leg side, hitting it through his legs and almost trickling onto the stumps.</p> <p><strong>John Starbuck:</strong> \"James, Morning. It looks (1st over) as if Dernbach and Finn are on a converging course: Dernbach needs to get faster for his regular stuff so the mystery balls come as more of a surprise, while Finn is working on his own slower variations. Also up for discussion is which wicketkeeper will Broad want for the T20 series? Will it be someone who has a good record of taking catches off the skipper's bowling? Bairstow is already being mentioned, but I'd imagine he'll go on the next overseas tours as the spare keeper to start with.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 17-0 (Smith 11, Amla 5)</strong> Tredwell drops a dolly at second slip! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! That was a chance to get Amla early and it wasn't a difficult catch, the South African edging a good length ball with decent pace outside his off stump. To be fair to Tredwell, it wasn't right in the bread basket, but England keep dropping Amla! Chance gone.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 20-0 (Smith 13, Amla 6)</strong> Amla pushes one through the off side but it's well fielded by Bopara, diving low to his left. Just a single then. Smith is moving so far across his crease it's untrue, and he slashes one down to third man that rushes to the rope, only to be suddenly stopped in its tracks by a sprawling Steve Finn! Wonderful athleticism from the big man.</p> <p><strong>Keith Flett:</strong> \"The Beard Liberation Front: the informal network of beard wearers has welcomed news of new England captain Alistair Cook's beard at Lords today. It marks, a significant departure from the follicly challenged era of Andrew Strauss said BLF Organiser Keith Flett.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 25-0 (Smith 13, Amla 11)</strong> Finn has Amla in a spot of bother in his next over...playing and missing before getting one to cut back into the top of of Amla's pad, half-hearted appeals for lbw but it was too high. Finn bangs one in short and it's pulled away for four, great shot but a needless delivery. A bit sloppy that and Amla gets a single off the next ball.</p> <p><strong>Gavin Phillipson:</strong> \"England really do need to stop dropping Amla - drop anyone but him! How many times in the series is it now - 5? Normally when you drop him he goes on to win the match for the Saffers - this time too?\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 27-0 (Smith 13, Amla 13)</strong> To be fair, there hasn't been too much swing out there this morning, just enough to keep the bowlers interested mind. Amla flicks one off his legs to third man, there is Finn again to prevent a boundary. It's another tight over from Anderson and he's bowled very well so far. England need a wicket soon you feel though.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 28-0 (Smith 14, Amla 13)</strong> Smith gets a thick edge off Finn, but it's wide of gully and safe, earning the South Africa Test captain a single. Amla plays and misses the next ball \u2013 he's had more than his fair share of fortune so far today, and Finn then gets one to jag back and rap off the bearded wonder's pads. Not out says the umpire but England review the decision. It did look a bit high and hit Amla on the knee roll, and lo and behold, it is comfortably over the stumps. England lose their review and that was a poor decision.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 32-0 (Smith 18, Amla 13)</strong> Change of bowler as Jade Dernbach replaces Anderson, the tattooed maestro steaming in and throwing in a few full deliveries outside off stump that Smith can't score off. A short and wide ball catches his inside edge and runs down for four \u2013 lucky for Smith as Dernbach persists with bowling way outside the line. Five balls of that over would have been given as wides had Smith left them! I know Dernbach is accommodating for Smith moving to the offside, but what happened to bowling at the stumps!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 34-0 (Smith 19, Amla 14)</strong> Ravi Bopara takes the 11th over for England. Third ball of the over is hit straight back at Ravinder, who plucks it out of the air before attempting a shy at the stumps. The bails are thrown asunder but Smith was well in his crease. Still, that shows Bopara has fire in his belly today. He gets one to jag back and that looked out! Hitting Amla just below the knee roll! Not out though says Richard Illingworth, but replays show it would have knocked over the leg stump. Bopara beats Smith's edge with a wicked last delivery, great end to the over!</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 40-0 (Smith 20, Amla 18)</strong> Amla chips one over the leg-side infield, always landing safe though. Dernbach hurls in a slower one that Smith doesn't pick at all, giving England's bowler a wry smile in the aftermath. You get the feeling that something's got to give soon for South Africa, they're not scoring freely at the moment, Amla nudging the last ball of the over for a single on the leg side.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 45-0 (Smith 22, Amla 21)</strong> Cook doesn't have a slip in place for Bopara and Amla edges one down to third man. It's a few singles here and there for South Africa to keep the strike alternating but they need to up the run rate a wee bit. To be fair, there were five easy runs off that over. You could argue either way really.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 46-0 (Smith 22, Amla 22)</strong> The run-rate is 3.46 at the moment, but with wickets in hand, South Africa are in a reasonably strong position. Samit Patel comes into the attack and there's a little bit of turn out there for the left-armer. Amla's trying to play him down the ground but to no avail, before slashing one through the off-side for a single. And that's all South Africa get off that over, great start from Patel.</p> <p><strong>Philip Podolsky:</strong> \"Hey James, mind giving a shout out to the Israeli cricket team who are <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-cricket-team-bowls-off-to-greece-for-european-tournament/\">off to the International Cricket Council Europe Division 2 Championships</a>... Some seriously exciting young talent in that squad.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 48-0 (Smith 23, Amla 23)</strong> Bopara again causing Smith a few problems, skidding it low and beating his edge. Still no slip in place and Beefy ain't happy about that! Just two runs from that over and the run-rate is now 3.20. They're going to have to up the anti, and the two batsman have a conflab down in the middle.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 52-0 (Smith 25, Amla 25)</strong> So apparently if England had not let Amla off the hook with so many dropped catches this summer his runs tally would be more than 500 short of his current total! Try telling that to Tredwell. Another tight over from Patel and England are about to take the bowling powerplay.<br><strong><br>Simon McMahon:</strong> \"Morning James. 48-0 after 15 overs. It's not exactly Joburg in March 2006, is it?\"</p> <p>That it ain't, Simon.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 57-0 (Smith 27, Amla 27)</strong> Finn comes back into the attack and he's coming round the wicket to Smith now, who fends a short one down the third man, with the despairing man at gully missing with his dive. OH NO! TREDWELL LETS ANOTHER DOWN! Smith edges one to slip and it's put down again, with Kieswetter perhaps distracting Tredwell with an attempted dive of his own. David Saker has his head in his hands on the balcony, and who can blame him. Catches win matches boys.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>11.31am: We'll it's a drinks break and time for England to regroup. Time to take James Tredwell out of the slips? A penny for his thoughts right now.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 66-0 (Smith 28, Amla 35)</strong> Amla knocks a six over Dernbach's head! It's a fraction too full and Amla just guides it over the rope beautifully, he didn't even look like he tried to hit it hard, just glorious timing. Smith then slashes one away past point and Dernbach finishes the over with a slower ball, conceding another single.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 68-0 (Smith 29, Amla 36)</strong> Good over from Finn but more excellent running from these South African openers, with Amla just knocking one short and sprinting to the opposite crease. Amla then wafts at a wide and short effort, missing it completely. Two runs from the over.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Walsh:</strong> \"James, the catch that Treadwell dropped off Finn wasn't his fault at all, Kieswetter dived right in front of Tredders, totally obstructed his view yet didn't get a glove on the ball, you wouldn't expect to see a howler like that by a club cricket third eleven 'keeper. Although Kieswetter takes the occasional stunning catch his glove work is generally shoddy and i'm not sure why England persist with him.\"</p> <p>I do agree that Kieswetter put him off, but Tredwell still should have done better. It went straight through him. Thoughts everyone?</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 68-1 (Smith b Dernbach, c Kieswetter 29)</strong></p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>Poor shot from Smith but a good ball from Dernbach, banging it in short and straight. Well taken by Kieswetter high above his head. That's the breakthrough! Next in, Duminy.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 72-1 (Amla 36, Duminy 4)</strong> Duminy leaves his first two but then edges one wide of Tredwell and down to the boundary for four. So unlucky for Dernbach, who is bowling excellently, and that may have carried if England had a second slip in place. Fine over.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 80-1 (Amla 37, Duminy 10)</strong> Good piece of fielding from Patel at mid-wicket, who hurls one at the stumps after Amla had called a quick single off Finn. Duminy is well in his crease, though, despite the decision going to the third umpire. Duminy then fishes at a square drive, gets a thick outside edge, and it runs away for four, just evading Morgan at backward point. The left-hander then opens the face and hits it the other side of Morgan, along the ground this time, for a single.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 87-1 (Amla 39, Duminy 15)</strong> Dernbach continues to run in at full tilt and Amla drives him through the covers, but Ian Bell is quickly across to save a boundary. Next up is a short one to Duminy, who ducks underneath it and doesn't fall into the same trap as Graeme Smith. Wonderful shot from JP, whose on-drive is straight down the ground and races to the rope.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 90-1 (Amla 40, Duminy 16)</strong> Anderson takes the reins and brings some renewed pace into the attack. He gets one to jag back into Amla's midriff, with South Africa running a single. Duminy goes back to an open face with Anderson bowling round the wicket to the left hander.</p> <p><strong>Simon McMahon:</strong> \"The first drop was unforgivable for two reasons. 1 - it was 'regulation' and 2 - it was Amla. The second was understandable because the keeper went for it, diving across and putting Treadwell off. He shouldn't be too hard on himself though. England's catching has been poor all summer, he obviously doesn't want to feel left out.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 98-1 (Amla 45, Duminy 17)</strong> James Tredwell comes into the attack. Let's hope he can put those dropped catches out of his mind and focus on his bowling. Duminy paddles one down to fine leg and the next delivery beats both Amla and Kieswetter all ends up, one into the extras column. Last ball of the over...and it's swept to the square leg boundary by Amla, wonderful shot, reaching well outside the off stump.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 100-2 (Amla b Bopara 45)</strong></p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>Delightful inswinger from Bopara, full length and beating Amla all ends up, hitting middle and leg. Who would have thunk it?! That's a key wicket for England.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 105-2 (Duminy 18, De Villiers 4)</strong> Bopara from the Pavilion End and that's a great over from him. The dismissal of Amla is obviously key, and he nearly takes the immediate scalp of AB De Villiers, who drags one inches past his stumps, running away to the backward square leg boundary for three, Dernbach diving to save the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 106-3 (Duminy b Tredwell, st Kieswetter 18)</strong></p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>Now we're talking! Tredwell, redeeming himself for his butter fingers, drifts a lovely off-spinner that drags Duminy out of his crease, nipping away from the batsman and giving Kieswetter ample time to nick the bails away.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 106-3 (De Villiers 5, Du Plessis 0)</strong> Excellent over from James Tredwell and that will have done him the world of good after those earlier dropped catches. Faf Du Plessis is next in.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 112-3 (De Villiers 11, Du Plessis 0)</strong> De Villiers with a textbook drive down the ground for four off Bopara, but next up he's in a spot of bother as Bopara throws down an inswinger that clatters off his pads, always going down leg though. Six from the over and England are in a stronger position now. 270 the par score in the last five ODI's at Lord's, but this pitch looks a bit more favourable to the bowlers.</p> <p><strong>Gary Naylor:</strong> \"Another 240 par pitch being misread by batting sides too keen to get on with it. As with most things in cricket, I blame the IPL.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 114-3 (De Villiers 12, Du Plessis 1)</strong> Tredwell is getting a lot of spin out there and there's just two from the over. A few more quick wickets and this would begin to slip away from South Africa, but there is still a lot of batting left in this side. You can see the confidence oozing from Tredwell now, what a change from earlier, when he wanted a gaping hole in the ground to gobble him up.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 115-4 (Du Plessis b Bopara, 1)</strong></p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 115-4 (De Villiers 13, Elgar 0)</strong> This is a great spell from Bopara. He's really got the bit between his teeth and two wickets to his name now. Three wickets from 15 runs for South Africa and I'd be a bit worried if I was De Villiers. It was an awful shot from Du Plessis, a man who is horribly out of nick, attempting to guide the ball down to third man but playing on instead. Next in is David Elgar.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 118-4 (De Villiers 15, Elgar 1)</strong> Great ball from Tredwell! The off-spinner drifts one in to Elgar and it spins back viciously into Kiewsetter's gloves. Elgar gets off the mark, though, cutting a short one through the off side for a single. 20 overs remaining in this innings, South Africa need to consider their tactics now. Attack, or focus on seeing out the overs?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 122-4 (De Villiers 17, Elgar 3)</strong> Bopara to continue his excellent spell but still Alastair Cook doesn't put a slip in place. Surprising, says Nasser Hussain, when you consider his figures during this game so far. Another tight over from Ravi, four off it, and England are beginning to turn the screw. 7 overs, 2-26 for Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 126-4 (De Villiers 18, Elgar 6)</strong> Elgar cuts Tredwell behind square for two, it's crucial that he tries to form a solid partnership with De Villiers now. De Villiers then knocks one through mid-wicket to keep him on strike. When are South Africa going to start hitting big?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 128-4 (De Villiers 19, Elgar 6)</strong> Bopara is bowling some first class stuff out there. His length is pretty full and his tight line is not allowing the new man in Elgar any easy runs. At this rate South Africa will do well to reach 220-230, which may not be enough on this pitch. Drinks break now for the players and a chance for both teams to consider their approaches for the remaining 16 overs. Anyone think South Africa can still post a good score?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 130-4 (De Villiers 20, Elgar 8)</strong> Elgar dinks one over his shoulder off Patel for one, and Cook has brought a slip up in for Patel. Vicious turn from Patel from outside Elgar's off stump, bringing it back into the left-hander. Only two runs off the over and De Villiers needs to up the ante.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 136-4 (De Villiers 23, Elgar 11)</strong> England now seem to be happy with allowing South Africa long singles to the outfield. Alastair Cook, fielding at mid-on, doesn't even attempt a shy at the stumps as Elgar scampers across for one. The batsman was always favourite to make that, but that epitomises England's approach right now. Six from the over, but no boundaries. Mandatory batting powerplay for South Africa.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 141-4 (De Villiers 25, Elgar 14)</strong> South Africa's run-rate is still under four an over as Patel trots in once again. The responsibility is truly with De Villiers right now, he's playing solidly outside the off stump but with Elgar at the other end, not exactly scoring freely, he may feel like cutting loose soon. Having said that, these two need to stay in and form a partnership.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 145-4 (De Villiers 25, Elgar 16)</strong> Finn strides in again and Elgar plays inside the line of the first delivery. Next up and it's an away swinger, but it just moves too much and that's given as a wide. Finn is cramping Elgar up in his crease here, banging them in short and straight at an awkward height. One jumps up at he batsman who has to fend it off right underneath his nose, well done. But Finn again concedes a wide as one slides down the leg side, great take from Kiewswetter though. Finn attempts a yorker but Elgar flicks it off his pads down to fine leg, Anderson fields, but looked to have pulled a muscle perhaps, he's moving a bit gingerly.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 148-4 (De Villiers 26, Elgar 18)</strong> Patel is getting a lot of turn out there and it's another good over from him, just three off it. The run-rate is 3.89 with 12 overs remaining. At the moment South Africa are on for about 210-20, but you expect them to start swinging soon.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 151-4 (De Villiers 29, Elgar 18)</strong> Finn powers in and bangs a short one down, cracking the South African captain on the lower arm. That will hurt for sure, but De Villiers just gets on with it. Astonishing cricket...Finn sends a short and wide one down the off side, but AB demonstrates wonderful footwork to trot across the line and guide it back to leg. He's jumping across his stumps like a cat on a hot tin roof, but doing well at the moment. Three from the over, Finn will take that.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 160-4 (De Villiers 34, Elgar 22)</strong> Elgar drags one to the wide long-on boundary off Patel but it still doesn't reach the rope, as Anderson jogs across to field. He still doesn't look altogether comfortable out there Jimmy. De Villiers edges one down to third man, it beats Kieswetter and Trott gallops down, diving well to save the four. Elgar attempts an ambitious thwack to cow corner but doesn't quite get hold of it. Still, nine off that over.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 166-5 (De Villiers b Tredwell, st Kieswetter 39)</strong></p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 166-5 (Elgar 23, Parnell 0)</strong> That's a crucial wicket for England and nice work with the gloves from Kieswetter. Tredwell tempted De Villiers out of his crease for a booming cover drive, but he misses it completely and, after a review, is stumped. Parnell is the next man in.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 170-5 (Elgar 25, Parnell 2)</strong> South Africa's run-rate has just crept above 4, and their projected total is still looking a wee bit light. Samit Patel again keeping it reasonably tight in that over, as Wayne Parnell gets off the mark with a couple of singles. Jade Dernbach next into the attack...</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 174-5 (Elgar 25, Parnell 5)</strong> Now Dernbach should be in his element, with South Africa chasing the runs, his variation could be deadly, and Alastair Cook has stuck two slips in. Mix up in the field between Bell and Trott. The Warwickshire team-mates get in a real muddle out in the field, Trott attempting a dummy slide that Bell misinterprets for the real thing. Absolute village, that. Dernbach sends one wide but then bangs one in short \u2013 Parnell attempts the pull but doesn't catch it cleanly. A slower delivery at 68.2mph next up, and Parnell can't pick it.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 174-6 (Parnell b Tredwell, st Kieswetter 5)</strong></p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>Another beautiful piece of deceptive bowling from Tredwell. He really has shaken off that earlier disappointment in the slips. The left-hander Parnell is tempted out of his crease and attempts the off-drive, missing the ball as it spins away then and hearing the fatal sound of glove on bail.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 176-6 (Elgar 26, Peterson 1)</strong> Peterson, another left-hander, to face Tredwell now. A complete mix up between the wickets! Peterson plays a forward defensive, begins to run before getting halfway and being sent back by Elgar. It looked like suicide as Kieswetter raced out to pick up the ball, but his throw back to the stumps was poor and Jimmy Anderson couldn't quite reach it low down. Peterson lives to fight another day, but that was terrible cricket all round!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 178-6 (Elgar 28, Peterson 1)</strong> Dernbach is causing Elgar all sorts of trouble. The South African can barely get the ball off the square. Just as I say that he drives one through the off side and Ian Bell has to scamper across the point boundary to save the four. Half-hearted appeals for lbw as the ball hits Elgar on the knee-roll, but always too high that. Two from the over.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 189-6 (Elgar 28, Peterson 12)</strong> A four! A four I say! Peterson reverse sweeps Tredwell down to the third man boundary and brings up a much needed boundary. A six! A six I say! Next up Peterson launches one over the ropes through mid-wicket! This is more like it from South Africa, as Peterson switches hands again and chips one over his leg side, it's in the air...but just short of Bell! Expensive over.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 198-6 (Elgar 34, Peterson 15)</strong> England know Elgar and Peterson are trying to hit big, so they counter their attacking with solid line and length. Alastair Cook takes the slip out and it's more of a defensive field now for England. He can't prevent a four from the next delivery, though, as Edgar lifts one to the long-on boundary. Slower, fuller ball to finish and South Africa take a quick single. Three overs remaining.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 209-6 (Elgar 35, Peterson 25)</strong> Dernbach is beginning to concede a few runs as Elgar and Peterson both find the boundary. Nine from the first three deliveries, but just one from the next two, that's a bit better from England's point of view. And it's just a single from the final ball of the over.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>48.5 overs: South Africa 214-6 (Elgar 35, Peterson 29)</strong> Finn from the Pavilion End now and Peterson flashes his blade at a short ball, that runs quickly all the way down to the third-man boundary. He's played a crucial role at the end of this innings and this is getting away from England a wee bit at the death. Peterson takes a single as the ball thumps his pads, and Elgar can't score off the next ball.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 214-7 (Edgar b Finn, c Kieswetter 35)</strong></p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>Edgar gloves a short one behind to Kieswetter, and to be honest, he hasn't really looked settled all innings.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 215-8 (McLaren, run out, Dernbach, 1)</strong></p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p>Finally a bit of joy for England in the field! McLaren hit one onto his pads with his first ball, ran the single, but then unselfishly tried to get back for the second, only for Dernbach to produce a direct hit!</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>50 overs: South Africa 220-8 (Peterson 31, Steyn 3)</strong> So a tight final over from Dernbach means South Africa finish with a score of 220. Steyn misses a slower ball and almost attempts a ludicrous single, only to think better of it. He does get two off the last delivery, though, with Kieswetter missing a run-out opportunity.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>South Africa: 220-8 after 50 overs. Changeover.</strong></p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p>Let's have a few views on that first innings please. Email me in your droves.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>James Debens:</strong> \"I was just wondering why Bairstow isn't playing? For all his bowling success, I don't have a lot of faith in Ravibop's batting.\"</p> <p>Indeed, his batting isn't the best, but did that earlier spell with the ball justify his selection?</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>John Starbuck:</strong> \"James, It looks like England know what they're doing with this SA batting line-up, who might have expected to get 250 at least. Again. Some luck, good and bad, and they need to work harder on catching drills using different combinations, but you'd say England have the upper hand. Let's see if the batsmen can do the right thing, too.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p>The teams are out for the second innings. 221 to win for England and Steyn to open the bowling...</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>0.5 overs: England 2-0 (Cook 2, Bell 0)</strong> Cook gets England off the mark with a cut that flies wide of point, and he comes back for two. Remember that Morkel isn't in this South Africa side, surely that's to the detriment of South Africa. Cook leaves one just outside the line of off stump, corr blimey, that was close to his off peg though! Only a few centimetres in it I reckon! Great judgement, or extremely lucky?</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 2-1 (Cook lbw b Steyn, 2)</strong></p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p>Oh dear oh dear. Steyn gets one to nip back in and that's plumb, going on to hit Cook's off stump, no review needed. Terrible start for England!</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 5-1 (Bell 0, Trott 0)</strong> Tsotsobe takes the next over and England are already on the ropes. However, he doesn't put the home side under any real pressure, a few looseners and byes conceded. Bell is beaten by one, the ball flying across the right-hander, before trying to chop one through point, but thwarted by the fielder.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Walsh:</strong> \"James, am I the only one who thinks that England's bowling attack since they left Bresnan out of the team looks 30% more effective? With Finn's pace and bounce, Anderson's swing, Dernbach's slower ball medley, Bopara's swinging dobbers and decent spin from Patel and Treadwell there's no obvious weak link. As a club player myself I'm not overly keen on facing any of these types of bowling but usually fill my boots against the straight up and down medium fast bowlers like Bresnan who come on to the bat at a nice speed without offering intimidating pace or swing. Bresnan has done OK against other teams but the South Africans have feasted on his bowling in all formats and I suspect the Indians will relish facing this type of bowling in home conditions. 220 looks about 30 below par to me and I expect England to win, hopefully they won't grind their way there but we'll enjoy some entertaining strokeplay from Morgan.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 10-1 (Bell 0, Trott 4)</strong> Steyn is a formidable bowler. He's sending bombs down at 90mph plus and at the moment England are struggling to get to grips with him. He beats Trott's outside edge before a short one forces him to duck out of the way. What would have been the final delivery of the over slips down the leg side, though, for a wide. Trott punishes him with a cover drive that runs up the hill for four, the ball flying off the bat there!</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 15-1 (Bell 1, Trott 5)</strong> Tsotsobe looked to be keeping it tight in his second over, but then he sends a wild ball down that is wide, even on the off side. Bell dabs one out to point and gets off the mark before Trott cuts one to wide third man.</p> <p><strong>Gary Naylor:</strong> \"SA suffered a bit from not knowing whether to go for 280 or 240. Every time they tried to get the scoring rate up, they lost a wicket until Peterson's shenanigans at the end. Had they gone for 240, they might have got it and, in these conditions, that's a good score. 220 is at least ten short and England know they can afford to rebuild their innings a couple of times at least.\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 17-1 (Bell 2, Trott 6)</strong> Steyn's pace has just dropped a tad. But when I say dropped, he is still wanging them down at around 88mph. I wouldn't want to be facing him, that's for sure. Trott attempts a pull to an aggressive short ball but it comes on to him too quickly and doesn't even get off the square, falling short of mid-off! That could have gone anywhere.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 21-1 (Bell 5, Trott 7)</strong> McLaren comes into the attack for South Africa, replacing Tsotsobe. Bell skips down the pitch and pulls one well through the leg side, it won't go for four, but that's a good two. McLaren then beats his edge with the next delivery, an instant response from the bowler.</p> <p><strong>Simon McMahon</strong>: \"Consensus seems to be SA are a few runs short, James, but their bowlers could have enough to keep it interesting. Might be a close finish. Or might not. Howzaaaaaaaat for penetrating analysis?\"</p> <p>Not out</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 22-1 (Bell 5, Trott 8)</strong> An 88mph leg break from Steyn, beating Trott comprehensively! Trott does a bit of gardening with the pitch but he needs to forget about that quickly, and he leaves the next two outside off stump. He then strangely plays outside one that cut back a wee bit down the hill. Steyn is flying at the moment, he's almost unplayable! A short one is fired down and Trott gets a glove on it and sprints to the non-striker's end as quickly as he can!</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p>Jonathan Trott is in a bit of pain after that blow on the hand from Steyn, and he's receiving a bit of treatment.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 31-1 (Bell 7, Trott 13)</strong> Trott dusts himself down and gets back into the zone after that knock. He looks to be OK and he clips McLaren off his legs, through mid-wicket for four. He is still struggling with his hand, however, as McLaren gives away two wides in succession, one on the off side and another down leg. Bell then fends a short one off his hips for a couple and this is looking like an expensive over all of a sudden.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 37-1 (Bell 7, Trott 17)</strong> Trott gobbles down a couple of pain killers and will be hoping they take effect pretty sharpish. Tsotsobe comes back into the attack and beats Trott's outside edge a few times. I think Trott is really struggling out there and isn't concentrating on the ball 100%. Understandable if you're hand is swelling and you're trying to face a quicky. But he regains his composure and guides the ball to the boundary, square on the off side, lovely shot. Tsotsobe sends a wide down, even though it was very close to Trott's leg stump.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 42-1 (Bell 11, Trott 18)</strong> Trott guides McLaren's short delivery down to third man for a single, handing Bell the strike. And just as I was about to wonder if Bell was struggling to get his eye in, he expertly pulls a tame short ball through the leg side for four. Excellent shot.</p> <p><strong>Adam Czarnowski:</strong> \"James. As Mikey Holding just said of the Proteas, we've also weakened our team with some \"bits and pieces\" cricketers, Little Bo Para and the dreary, uninspiring Patel, to name but two. This and the depressing dropped catches made me think of Bob Willis priceless \"England have clambered back into the treacle-tin of their own mediocrity.\" Come back KP, all is forgiven?\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 45-1 (Bell 12, Trott 20)</strong> Bell is using his feet really well and moving down the wicket wherever possible. He swipes one from Tsotsobe to the mid-wicket boundary before clipping a shot off his legs to the same man in the outfield. He's beginning to see the ball pretty big now I reckon.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 47-1 (Bell 13, Trott 21)</strong> Elgar, the left-arm spinner, is now brought into the South African attack. It's a strong start from him and just two off the over.</p> <p><strong>Scott Poynting:</strong> \"Re 9th over, isn't Trott taking painkillers under the circumstances using a performance enhancing drug? Perhaps he should have taken a leaf from Shane Warne's book and got them from his mum!\"</p> <p>I suppose they are helping his performance, aye! But I'm sure we can let him off this one.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 48-1 (Bell 13, Trott 21)</strong> Trott is really struggling out there, he takes off his glove and is massaging his finger to relieve the pain. Tsotsobe bangs a short one in and Trott ducks out of the way. You do wonder if he is going to retire hurt, get some ice on it and come out again later in the innings if required. Even anodyne deliveries are causing him problems.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 55-1 (Bell 16, Trott 23)</strong> Elgar strolls up to the crease again and Bell attempts a tickle down the leg side, Smith and De Villiers move to early and expect him to make the shot, but the ball beats everyone and runs down to the boundary, where Tsotsobe prevents it crossing the rope. The 50 partnership is brought up and that's a fine effort from these two after Cook's early dismissal.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 58-1 (Bell 19, Trott 23)</strong> Parnell steaming in and Bell can't score off the first three balls of the over. A shorter one next up though and Bell pulls it behind square, it's in the air, but safe and a good shot. I'm sure Trott will be grateful that he didn't have to face a ball in that over and Bell runs a single on the last, some more respite for his hand injury.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 61-1 (Bell 21, Trott 24)</strong> Peterson comes in for an over and brings the run-rate down a tad with some slow and tight bowling, drifting the ball into the right-handers. Soft hands from Bell, nudging the ball past slip for a single.</p> <p>Two cracking lines from <strong>Adam Czarnowski:</strong></p> <p>\"James, Elgar, the SA spinner, has some interesting variations, though no Enigmas thus far.\"</p> <p>\"Trott needs Anadin deliveries, not anodyne ones, surely?\"</p> <p>Wonderful Adam, just wonderful.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p>Drinks break</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 71-1 (Bell 29, Trott 24)</strong> Two quick fours from Bell and he's cantering along nicely now. First he cuts one fine down to the third man boundary before smashing an exquisite drive through the covers. That raced to the rope. He is a wonderful player, Bell, once he gets into the groove. And he seems to have rattled Parnell, who steps over the line for a no ball, and again with his next delivery! Oh dear.</p> <p>Scathing reply from <strong>Josh Robinson:</strong> \"Afternoon Riach, afternoon everybody. Impressive as Adam Czarnowski's line was, the Elgar-Enigma Variations comment would be more impressive if it wasn't it self a variation on something that David Gower used it on Sky a few games ago. Before that it had already been used on Test Match Sofa, probably on the other TMS as well. I imagine it was also sent to the OBO, but I don't know if Smyth was ever so desperate as to publish it.\"</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 73-1 (Bell 30, Trott 25)</strong> Poor communication between Trott and Bell but they get away with it, scampering for a quick single with De Villiers knocking the bails off in frustration rather than hope. Two from Peterson's over and he's having a good little spell.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 80-1 (Bell 35, Trott 26)</strong> It's looking very comfortable for England at the moment. Parnell needs a strong over but Bell again advances down the pitch and slashes one over the covers for four. A single off the next delivery, good running from the batsmen after Steyn had slightly misfielded at mid-off.</p> <p><strong>Phil Russell:</strong> \"I think all this complaining about weak Elgar puns is a bit pompous, given the circumstances...\"</p> <p>Oh yes</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 88-1 (Bell 42, Trott 27)</strong> Peterson again with his left-arm spin now, it's steady stuff but all of the sudden Bell skips down, opens the face of the bat and drives one through the off side for six, hitting the boundary line on the full! Wonderful shot!</p> <p>Right that's all from me folks, Simon Burnton takes up the mantle and will guide you through to the close.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 90-1 (Bell 42, Trott 28)</strong> Hello everyone. I might as well lay my cards on the table: I got back from a fortnight in the south of France yesterday, had thought about little other than the Olympics for a couple of months before that, and have spent most of this afternoon watching football. Anyway, just two runs off that McLaren over, one of them a wide.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 95-1 (Bell 42, Trott 32)</strong> Five from Peterson's over, and England are proceeding serenely towards their target, with Cook's early dismissal an ever more distant and irrelevant memory. Of course, it could all change...</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 102-1 (Bell 44, Trott 37)</strong> Two poor deliveries in McLaren's first six \u2013 one a bouncer that flies a yard and a half over Trott's head for a wide, and the other a loose ball that Bell thunders it away for ... a single, straight to Amla. The seventh delivery is scooped away, in the air but perfectly safe, for four by Trott.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 102-1 (Bell 44, Trott 37)</strong> A maiden over, played with very little aggression by an utterly relaxed Bell. Southampton celebrate by going 1-0 up against Manchester United, provoking a loud exclamation of \"GOAL!\" around Guardian HQ.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 109-1 (Bell 49, Trott 39)</strong> Steyn returns, and with his second ball he finds Bell's edge. It flies through the massive gap between De Villiers and first slip, neither of whom moves, and away for four.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 110-1 (Bell 49, Trott 40)</strong> That's one run from the last two Pieterson overs, in which Bell has faced 11 balls without scoring.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 114-1 (Bell 51, Trott 41)</strong> Bell dabs the ball to third man to bring up his half-century, and mistimes a pull for a last-ball single.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 118-1 (Bell 55, Trott 42)</strong> Parnell, the most expensive of South Africa's bowlers so far, attempts a fourth over. Just four runs off the over. \"One reason for Bell doing well in the shorter game is that, after being dropped for the West Indies performances, when he came back into the side we could see he'd obviously done a lot of gym work,\" writes John Starbuck. \"His shoulders and arms were massive compared with his earlier physique, so he could wield the now-requisite heavy bat so much better. The streaky shots converted into fours from light touches make a huge difference.\"</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 127-1 (Bell 63, Trott 43)</strong> Tsotsobe, the least expensive of South Africa's bowlers so far, follows him and concedes nine. Bell impresses with a hefty four sent back over the bowler's head, but flirts with a run-out by attempting a risky two \u2013 a decent throw would have left him a yard and a half short of the crease. The throw is rubbish.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 132-1 (Bell 65, Trott 46)</strong> Elgar, now South Africa's most economical bowler after Tsotsobe's ugly previous over, has a go. Five singles are the result.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 141-1 (Bell 73, Trott 47)</strong> Bell is dropped! He tries to drive the ball over mid on, but doesn't get enough on it. Peterson seems to misjudge the flight of the ball, realising too late quite how high it is, and though his hands shoot upwards he never looks like holding it, and indeed doesn't. The next ball, with an air of inevitability, is violently dispatched over midwicket for four. The last is an attempted six hit back down the ground that falls six yards short, but without a fielder within shouting distance.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 143-2 (Trott lbw b Elgar, 48)</strong> South Africa finally make a breakthrough, thanks to a review \u2013 Trott, given not out initially, is actually plumb. Given the way the match is going, and the fact that he's nursing an injured hand, it's no disaster.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 143-2 (Bell 74, Bopara 0)</strong> So the question was, how long can Trott bat through injury. And the question now is, can Bopara rediscover some form?</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 148-2 (Bell 79, Bopara 0)</strong> Tsotsobe's third ball is dirt poor, all but demanding that Bell taps it down to long leg for four, which he does. A single off the following delivery leaves Bopara with two deliveries to face. The first he only just manages to pull away from in time, after initially being tempted into a half-hearted prod. The second he defends reasonably well.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 150-2 (Bell 80, Bopara 1)</strong> Elgar continues, and the batsmen take a run each. I've been tortured all afternoon by the knowledge that, just yards from the office where I am toiling, there is an ice cream festival taking place. An ice cream festival. A festival of ice cream. In just 55 minutes it will close, and my torture will be over.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>34.1 overs: England 150-2 (Bell 80, Bopara 1)</strong> It's raining, and the players have been called in.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>Rain delay</strong> If it doesn't stop raining \u2013 and the forecast is that it will, quite soon \u2013 England will win on the Duckworth-Lewis method.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>It's stopped raining!</strong> And the players are making their way back out.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 155-2 (Bell 80, Bopara 6)</strong> Some more poor fielding, from Tsotsobe, allows Bopara's pull to bounce away for four. We're told that Trott will have an X-ray on his hand, though not until tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 156-3 (Bopara c De Villiers b McLaren, 6)</strong> Nope, Bopara's run of poor form is not over. He brushes a ball he could have left straight through to the keeper, and now some nerves could surface for England. Enter Morgan.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 157-3 (Bell 80, Morgan 0)</strong> Another wicket soonish and this could be interesting. They haven't given up \u2013 McLaren's first ball to Morgan is played in short and only just evades the bat on its way through to the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 159-3 (Bell 81, Morgan 2)</strong> Steyn's eighth over, and England get a couple of singles off it. The last ball skids over Morgan's head as he takes a wild swing at it. We could have a fun few overs ahead, if that's going to be his attitude.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 167-3 (Bell 82, Morgan 9)</strong> Morgan's first boundary is a classy straight drive that disappears off his bat, and McLaren's next delivery pootles through mid off for three. He looks in good touch.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 170-3 (Bell 82, Morgan 12)</strong> Injury update: Trott, pictured on the balcony, isn't too injured to hold a cup of tea. Three runs from Parnell's over, all of them scored by Morgan.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 173-3 (Bell 83, Morgan 13)</strong> Three runs off the over, one of them a wide, and England's target is now less than 50 runs away. This is an ODI disguised as a Test. The run rate is low, and doesn't have to get higher. The excitement rate is low, and mightn't get much higher either. England still seem in control, and only the dismissal of Bell sometime soon can change that.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 176-3 (Bell 85, Morgan 13)</strong> Parnell bowls a full toss, and Bell swings and misses, blinking his eyes to suggest that he didn't see the ball at all. Fortunately it flies six inches wide of the off stump, and Bell recovers to score three off the remaining balls.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 182-3 (Bell 87, Morgan 18)</strong> The highlight of Peterson's over is Morgan's brilliantly controlled pull for four. Six runs come from the over in all; the required run rate is 4.875.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 186-3 (Bell 88, Morgan 21)</strong> This is as comfortable as an old pair of slippers or a brand new baby snow goose down duvet. It's as relaxed as a Usain Bolt v obese British under-sixes 200m sprint. Can anything change the direction of this match now? England need 35 to win.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 186-4 (Bell c De Villiers b Steyn 88)</strong> Maybe! An excellent innings from Bell ends with a top edge that De Villiers collects one-handed, leaping.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 189-4 (Morgan 24, Kieswetter 1)</strong> Steyn makes the breakthrough that South Africa had been so desperate for, but with six overs and 32 runs to go, is it too late? As Simon McMahon boasts: \"My prediction earlier that we might, or might not, see a close finish is beginning to look rather prescient, no? Call me mad, but I'm standing by it. That's how I roll.\" Go on, stick your neck out.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 195-4 (Morgan 24, Kieswetter 5). England need 26 to win off 30 balls</strong> A brilliantly-timed drive from Kieswetter brings a boundary from the first ball of the over, and only an excellent diving stop from Amla stops Morgan emulating him two balls later. Kieswetter ends the over considerably less impressively than he started it, though, with a swing and a miss.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 207-4 (Morgan 36, Kieswetter 5). England need 14 to win off 24 balls</strong> Instead of sticking with Steyn and searching for wickets, South Africa go with McLaren and his second ball is slow but read by Morgan and tickled away for four. He relaxes for a couple of balls and then hoicks the next over long on for a one-bounce four, and swings at the last, with even a poor contact being enough to send the ball to the boundary. Twelve runs off the over, all of them boundaries, and this match is surely over.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>ENGLAND WIN BY SIX WICKETS! 46.4 overs: England 224-4 (Morgan 36, Kieswetter 21)</strong> Now South Africa do turn to Steyn, and it doesn't go well at all. <em>Not at all</em>. Kieswetter thumps his first delivery through mid wicket for four. The next is called wide, and after that Kieswetter takes a couple of steps and flukily top-edges the ball for another four. That leaves England needing three, and the next ball is thumped mightily back over the bowler's head and away for six to win it.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>England will end 2012 as the world's No1 ODI team! </strong>After that they go to India, so they should probably enjoy it while it lasts. The fielding wasn't great, but every batsman but the unlucky Cook, who got a good ball early, and Bopara, who is out of touch and looked it, impressed.</p>",
  "<p>Believe it or not, there was a point here when Robin van Persie seemed dangerously close to experiencing the snake-lick of his manager's tongue. The Dutchman had missed a penalty, trying a disguised chip that went horribly wrong, and Sir Alex Ferguson was facing the distinct possibility that Manchester United's 1,000th game on his watch was going to end in something bordering on disarray.</p> <p>What happened next was nothing short of extraordinary and can be filed, with immediate effect, in the already bulging portfolio of great United comebacks. Van Persie's equaliser arrived after 87 minutes and the game had extended into stoppage time when his header flashed past Kelvin Davis for a hat-trick winner. He had turned the match upside down \u2013 devastatingly, and just as Southampton were daring to believe they had their first win of the season.</p> <p>Football can be brutal and Southampton will know now how unforgiving the Premier League can be for newcomers. They had played with great spirit and togetherness and United were so generous in their defending it would not have been unjust if the home side had been reflecting on a superb victory.</p> <p>Instead, it became a demonstration of why Van Persie cleaned up with the footballer of the year awards last season and why his new employers were so desperate to beat Manchester City to his signature. The penalty? He will want to watch the replays through the gaps in his fingers and it is doubtful he will ever try that form of chutzpah again. Ultimately, though, that aberration simply reinforced the sense that Southampton had encountered something special.</p> <p>A lesser footballer might still have been ruminating on what he had done, whereas Van Persie simply set about making sure he rewrote the story again. It was a demonstration of his mentality, as well as his talent for putting the ball in the net, and in both respects he passed with distinction, sparing his team a second defeat in their first three league games.</p> <p>Nigel Adkins' side deserved the ovation they were afforded at the final whistle. They had matched United, just as they did against Manchester City on the opening weekend, and on this evidence they should not be discouraged about their hopes of staying in the division. To have no points after playing so stoutly must feel galling in the extreme.</p> <p>Southampton had never displayed any kind of inferiority complex and, at 2-1, there was a 10-minute spell when United were in danger of conceding even more. Rickie Lambert had headed the home side into a 17th-minute lead and Morgan Schneiderlin had exposed more vulnerability in the air to restore the advantage 11 minutes into the second half. Van Persie demonstrated his brilliant, penetrative qualities in between, controlling Antonio Valencia's cross on his chest and lashing his volley past Davis after a slip from the nearest defender, Nathaniel Clyne.</p> <p>This, however, was a strange day for the deposed champions. Van Persie had squandered another three presentable chances before the penalty and, defensively, it must have been alarming for Ferguson to see how susceptible his team were. Patrice Evra, marking Schneiderlin, was guilty of a slip that was decisive for Southampton's second goal, whereas Lambert's effort stemmed from Tom Cleverley playing a questionable pass to Shinji Kagawa and Schneiderlin, showing great anticipation, stealing in to dispossess the Japan international. Jason Puncheon delivered the cross from the right and Lambert was at the far post, exposing Rafael da Silva's lack of inches with a perfectly placed header.</p> <p>Schneiderlin was outstanding, while the movement and directness of Lambert, Adam Lallana and Puncheon caused United considerable problems. Ferguson had dropped David de Gea, blaming the talented but erratic Spaniard for one of Fulham's goals at Old Trafford the previous weekend, but Anders Lindegaard's poor kicking on at least five occasions was typical of the encouragement United gave their opponents.</p> <p>There is something enduringly brilliant about the way Ferguson reorganises his teams when they are chasing games. They had been struggling with 4-2-3-1, with Danny Welbeck on the left rather than a natural wide player. Now they reverted to the 4-4-2 system of old, with Paul Scholes and Nani coming off the bench. Within a minute Scholes had set Van Persie running into the penalty area for a chance he could not convert. Then came the penalty after Davis's poor clearance had gone to Nani and Jos Hooiveld, though connecting with the ball, scythed through the back of Van Persie's legs.</p> <p>If the penalty chip comes off it can look majestic, as Andrea Pirlo demonstrated against England at Euro 2012. Van Persie's, in stark contrast, could have ruined Ferguson's latest milestone. Except he refused to be cowed. Van Persie pounced on the rebound after Rio Ferdinand's header had struck a post and completed the recovery with a darting run and near-post header from Nani's corner. It was the way he had played himself out of Ferguson's ire that will linger in the memory.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Robin van Persie (Manchester United)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://uk.adserver.yahoo.com/a?f=2144372905&amp;p=&amp;l=EVL2&amp;c=r\"> <style type=\"text/css\"> .epl_container,.epl_top_container, .spon_left, .spon_right, .epl_clear{display:block;margin:0px;padding:0px;min-height:0px;font-size:0px;border:0px;white-space:nowrap;}     .epl_container{background-color:#000000;} .epl_top_container{background:#F9F9F9 url(http://l.yimg.com/i/i/uk/any/e/bkg.jpg) repeat-x scroll top;} .spon_left{width:140px;float:left;height:60px;overflow:hidden;background:#000000 url(http://l.yimg.com/i/i/uk/any/e/ylogo.jpg) no-repeat;} .spon_right{width:160px;float:right;height:60px;overflow:hidden;background:#000000 url(http://l.yimg.com/i/i/uk/any/e/right.jpg) no-repeat;} .epl_clear{clear:both;} </style>  <div class=\"epl_container\" style=\"width:460px;\"> <div class=\"epl_top_container\"> <div class=\"spon_left\"><script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://uk.adserver.yahoo.com/a?f=2144372905&p=&l=EVL2&c=r\"></script></div> <div class=\"spon_right\"><script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\"src=\"https://uk.adserver.yahoo.com/a?f=2144372905&p=&l=EVL&c=r\"></script></div> <div class=\"epl_clear\"></div> </div>  <object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" width=\"460\" height=\"399\" id=\"yahoovideoplayer2\"> <param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /> <param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://d.yimg.com/nl/premier-league/guardian/player.swf\"/> <param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"vid=30483848&playlistId=20682645&lang=en-GB\"/> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"/> <embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" id=\"yahoovideoplayer2\" src=\"https://d.yimg.com/nl/premier-league/guardian/player.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" flashvars=\"vid=30483848&playlistId=20682645&lang=en-GB\" width=\"460\" height=\"399\"/></object> </div> </figure>",

Locals had been whipped into a frenzy by Chishti, who reportedly showed the burned pages to mosque-goers at evening prayers and led a crowd of people to Rimsha's house.</p> <p>But after two weeks of controversy during which the case has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/27/pakistani-muslim-christian-girl-blasphemy\" title=\"\">criticised by both human rights groups and even hardline religious conservatives</a>, three of Chishti's deputies have come forward to implicate the mullah.</p> <p>Hafiz Mohammad Zubair told Geo TV that he witnessed Chishti putting two pages of the Qu'ran into a plastic bag of ashes in order to strengthen the case against the girl.</p> <p>Zubair said: \"I asked him what he was doing and he said this is the evidence against them and this is how we can get them out from this area.\"</p> <p>Chishti was brought blindfolded and handcuffed before a court in Islamabad on Sunday morning where he was ordered to remain in police custody for 14 days.</p> <p>Tahir Naveed Chaudhry from the All Pakistan Minority Committee said it had always maintained that evidence was planted on her.</p> <p>\"And now it is proved that the whole story was only designed to dislocate the Christian people,\" he said. \"He must be prosecuted under the blasphemy law as it will set a precedent against anyone else who tries to misuse that law.\"</p> <p>In a bail application made last week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/pakistan-christian-blasphemy-girl-quran?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">defence lawyers said Rimsha was just 13 years old</a> and should therefore be tried under Pakistan's juvenile justice system. It also claimed the girl had Down's syndrome and therefore \"cannot commit such a crime\".</p> <p>On Sunday the head of the country's Ulema council, a board of senior clerics, demanded the punishment of Chishti and the immediate release of Rimsha. However, Rao Abdur Raheem, the lawyer representing the girl's accuser Hammad, said the development did not change his case. He said he was \"1,000% sure\" that her bail application, due to be heard on Monday, would be rejected.</p> <p>\"Our case is totally separate from the case against Chishti,\" he said. \"The man who accused him of adding pages from the Qur'an also confirmed that Rimsha burned a book containing verses from the Qur'an.\"</p> <p>Chishti had made no secret of his distaste for the several-hundred-strong Christian community of Mehrabadi, even appearing on national television to bemoan the noisiness of church services which he said had disturbed Muslim residents, the overwhelming majority in the area.</p> <p>He also welcomed the panicked departure of most of the Christians from the area following the furore. He had reportedly made an announcement from the mosque's loudspeaker telling them to leave the area.</p> <p>\"We are not upset the Christians have left and we will be pleased if they don't come back,\" Chishti told the Guardian on 18 August.</p> <p>However, his actions may well have alienated the community's Muslim landlords who rely on poor Christian families to rent their properties.</p> <p>Human rights groups say the blasphemy laws are often used to settle vendettas and property disputes. People have been sentenced to long jail terms on extremely weak evidence, some of which cannot even be examined in court for fear of repeating the alleged blasphemy.</p> <p>Others have been killed by furious mobs, such as last July when a mentally ill man was dragged from a police station in Punjab province and burned alive in the street.</p> <p>Ali Dayan Hasan, head of Human Rights Watch in Pakistan, said he hoped the arrest of Chishti would \"act as a deterrent to further frivolous charges and will seek to temper this atmosphere of impunity with which extremists incite violence against vulnerable people in the name of blasphemy\".</p> <p>But it is unlikely the controversy over Rimsha will lead to fundamental reform of Pakistan's blasphemy laws as the country gears up for an election. Last year two prominent politicians were assassinated by religious hardliners after speaking out against the law.</p> <p>Mumtaz Qadri, a former security guard who last year gunned down his boss, Salman Taseer, the governor of the Punjab at the time, is regarded by many Pakistanis as a hero for killing a man who had publicly criticised the blasphemy laws and given his backing to a Christian woman who had been sentenced to death for the crime.</p>",
  "<p>A survivor of the 7/7 London bombings whose bloodied face became one of the best known images of the day could face expulsion from the UK.</p> <p>John Tulloch lost his British nationality under a clause governing people born in pre-independence India. Despite being raised and educated in the UK from the age of three and working and living in the country for most of his life, Tulloch's status as someone born to British parents in the former colony led to him losing his nationality when he took out Australian citizenship.</p> <p>\"I am totally gobsmacked by this,\" said Tulloch, who has been told that he can only visit Britain for brief periods as a tourist. \"I've got a huge attachment to Britain. My family has served Britain for three generations. I've been banging my head against a wall trying to get this sorted out, but I've never before encountered so much frustration. It's like Kafka.\"</p> <p>The army officer's son was granted a lesser form of British nationality known as \"British subject without citizenship\".</p> <p>Following a career in UK academia, he was granted citizenship in Australia after taking a job there. Tulloch returned to the UK after directing the Centre for Cultural Research into Risk between 2002 and 2004 at Australia's Charles Stuart University. Prior to that, he was head of the School of Journalism at Cardiff University. Unlike \"full\" British citizens, who could hold dual citizenship, Tulloch's acquired Australian status led to the cancellation of his British nationality and his passport was confiscated when he applied for its renewal.</p> <p>\"Neither I nor my parents ever received information from the government that this was somehow an inferior passport,\" Tulloch told the Sunday Telegraph. \"In particular, the passport itself explicitly said that you could take out dual nationality without risking your British nationality.\"</p> <p>Tulloch, who was around a metre from bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan at Edgware Road tube station in the 7/7 attacks, said: \"There I was, hailed as an example of British courage, British pluck and the British spirit, an iconic image of British resistance. I get blown up in the media as a British patriot, then I get kicked out.\"</p> <p>He added: \"When I came back from a trip to Vienna two or three months ago, I got a really hard time at Heathrow. I am worried that if I leave again, I might not be let back in.\" A UK Border Agency spokesman said: \"If you are a British subject otherwise than by connection with the Republic of Ireland or a British protected person you will lose that status on acquiring any other nationality or citizenship. It is the responsibility of an individual to check that they will not lose a previously acquired nationality or citizenship on acquiring an additional one.\"</p> <p>However, Home Office sources said that Tulloch would be \"welcome to submit\" an application to extend his stay in the UK in an appropriate category.\"</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-346906243\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_22531908001_kevinlanewithoutphotos-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>The story of Operation Cactus is still unfolding after 18 years, and in some respects it is a murder inquiry that can best be encapsulated by reference to a series of significant dates and numbers.</p> <p>Robert Magill was murdered near his home in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, on 13 October 1994, as he was walking his dog, Oscar. In 1996, Kevin Lane was convicted of shooting him in what was seen as a contract killing, and for 16 years he has been protesting his innocence.</p> <p>In that time, Lane has written more than 5,000 letters and had six lawyers. <a href=\"http://www.justiceforkevinlane.com/\" title=\"\">Supporters have set up a website</a> and raised more than \u00a3100,000 to help him conduct a miscarriage of justice campaign that is heavily focused on one man: a bent copper. Eight years ago, a detective in the Magill murder inquiry, Detective Sergeant Chris Spackman, was jailed for four years after a trial that exposed him as deeply corrupt and raised questions about his conduct in other investigations.</p> <p>Lane believes he is close to being able to show he was implicated as the result of an inappropriate relationship between Spackman and a known criminal, Roger Vincent. None of this could have been known to the Old Bailey jurors when Lane was sent down all those years ago, but it may all undermine the safety of the decision they made. That is Lane's contention, and the 44-year-old may soon prise open the files of Operation Cactus.</p> <p>It is often said the wheels of justice turn slowly, but in some cases, they hardly seem to turn at all. The details get murkier and more confusing with every disclosure, but Lane's predicament is all too familiar to any prisoner attempting to challenge a conviction.</p> <p>Lane has had to turn detective and lawyer to keep his case from disappearing completely. With a secondhand laptop on his knees, he has been working on legal challenges for 40 hours a week during all the time he has been inside.</p> <p>The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which was set up the year after Lane was convicted, is currently undertaking its fourth review of the case, having been ordered to do so by the court of appeal last November.</p> <p>Judges had hoped the CCRC would have finished its work this January, and when that deadline was missed, by the end of April. The CCRC is still looking at the files. A spokesman said its investigation would be completed \"sooner rather than later but it is not possible to put an exact date on it\".</p> <p>Lane has criticisms of the CCRC, but the body set up to look at cases like his has it own problems, which go far beyond its investigation into any individual. During the time Lane has been in jail, since early 1995, the prison population has increased by about 75% to 86,000. Meanwhile, the budget for the CCRC has been cut.</p> <p>Its <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/ccrc/ccrc-annual-report-accounts-2010-11.pdf\" title=\"\">annual report for 2011 </a>said: \"Our budget has been reduced over the past six years by nearly 30% or \u00a32.6m in real terms. We put on hold plans to recruit new commissioners, we made a round of redundancies and anticipated further, voluntary, redundancies; we implemented strict spending controls and reviewed all areas of expenditure.\" Over the past three years, the CCRC's funding has shrunk from \u00a36.51m to \u00a35.2m.</p> <p>Though the CCRC says it does not believe this has compromised its inquiries into Lane's case, Lane himself is not convinced it has the capacity for an investigation as complex, and potentially sensitive, as his.</p> <p>Little by little, Lane and his current solicitor, Maslen Merchant, have uncovered details about the original murder inquiry which suggest, they say, that Lane was the victim of a set-up.</p> <p>At the heart of this allegation is the Hertfordshire detective jailed in 2003 for what the judge called \"a disgraceful catalogue of crime and lies\". Spackman was caught plotting to steal \u00a3160,000 from his own force, and had been siphoning off money to spend on a younger woman he was trying to impress.</p> <p>This man was the officer in charge of disclosure evidence during the Magill inquiry, and he also questioned or had contact with other suspects and informers. One of the suspects was Vincent.</p> <p>In the early days of the investigation Vincent and his friend David Smith were named as Magill's murderers in 20 separate tip-offs. They were both questioned, and Vincent was charged alongside Lane.</p> <p>Official records, which were not disclosed to Lane or his lawyers at the time, show that Spackman met Vincent at least once before the trial, without anyone else present, for an informal chat. According to Spackman's note of the meeting, Vincent was trying to cut a deal. Vincent had denied involvement in the killing, but he told police he knew who had ordered the \"hit\" and how much the killers had been paid.</p> <p>In return for this evidence, Vincent wanted the charges against him dropped. That did not happen, but it was unnecessary in any case. During the trial, the case against Vincent was abandoned, with the prosecution admitting his alibi had not been properly investigated.</p> <p>After his release from custody, records show Spackman went to Vincent's mother's home twice. Lane's belief is that Vincent and Spackman were in cahoots, and that the detective engineered the direction of the investigation in a way that put Lane in the dock. At the moment, this remains a conspiracy theory, but there is circumstantial evidence suggesting Lane's fears need to be more fully explored.</p> <p>In 2005, Vincent and Smith, the pair originally named by informers as Magill's killers, were convicted of a shooting that was remarkably similar. Using an AK-47 assault rifle, they murdered a man called David King as he left a gym in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. The judge described it as a \"thoroughly planned, ruthless and brutally executed assassination\" \u2013 and jailed them for 30 and 25 years at Luton crown court.</p> <p>Last year credence was lent to Lane's claim that he was set up when his lawyer was sent bundles of documents that appeared to be confidential police files. Within them were copies of apparently secret police memos. Merchant says the files, if genuine, show Lane was the victim of a deliberate and blatant plot.</p> <p>After his conviction, stories appeared in the tabloids saying Lane was a contract killer who detectives called \"the executioner\".</p> <p>The appeal court has asked the CCRC to establish whether the documents are real, and also to find the black bin-liner that was the crucial evidence against Lane at his trial. The bag was found in the boot of the car used by Magill's killers, and it had Lane's palm print on it. Lane has never denied driving the car: he had borrowed it a week before the murder and his son's fingerprints were also found on the vehicle.</p> <p>But nobody seems to know where the bin-liner is now. \"We have spent years asking about its whereabouts,\" said Merchant. \"We still don't know.\"</p> <p>In among all the fragments of new evidence and the coincidences, and within documents that they believe are being withheld, Lane believes the truth about Magill's murder can be found. He insists he will not admit to a crime he did not commit, even though that may affect his chances of getting out now he is approaching the end of the minimum 18-year prison term set by the court.</p> <p>\"I believe there is enough new information to affect the safety of the conviction,\" said Merchant. \"If jurors back then had known what we know now, it is hard to imagine they could have found Kevin guilty.</p> <p>\"The evidence about the meeting between Spackman and Vincent was not disclosed at the time of the trial. If it had been, Kevin could have raised questions about whether the two men had an improper relationship, and whether they had acted together to find a scapegoat.</p> <p>\"He could have launched a positive defence. Every time we find out something new, lo and behold, Spackman is in the middle of it.\"</p> <p>Merchant says Lane's determination to see this through has not dimmed, despite the setbacks, and the difficulties of trying to run a campaign from inside jail. Lane acknowledges he is in some danger now. With the appeal court now&#xa0;involved, and the CCRC under pressure to deliver, the case is finally coming to a head.</p> <p>He has told the Guardian that there are people inside jail who are trying to shut him up \u2013 permanently. But he won't be deterred.</p> <p>\"Kevin is a very strong character,\" said Merchant. \"He can't address his offending behaviour because he won't admit to the offence. If&#xa0;the governor of a prison told him, 'Here, sign this piece of paper, admit you did it, and you'll be out,' Kevin wouldn't do it. He will not do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>My friend Richard Mullings, who has died aged 81, had a hugely varied career, including many years as the stage-doorkeeper at the Royal Shakespeare theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon.</p> <p>Richard was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, but brought up in Stratford, where his father was head brewer at the legendary Flowers Brewery. After he failed to get into Dartmouth Royal Naval College, Richard joined the merchant navy at the age of 16. On leave in Cornwall, he was rung up by the landlord of the local pub, who was also captain of the Sennen lifeboat. A ship of the Blue Funnel Line had run aground and the lifeboat was a crew member short. Could he replace him? Richard did and the crew was rescued in stormy seas. Only later, while he was drinking restorative brandies in the Old Success Inn, did how dangerous it had been hit him.</p> <p>After a spell as an Irish Guardsman, Richard returned to Stratford to run a pub, the Falstaff. In 1962, he joined the Royal Shakespeare theatre, working in the props department and then in front-of-house before his noted tact, firmness and bonhomie ensured that he was appointed to the high-profile job of stage-doorkeeper.</p> <p>He became a friend of many of the actors, including Peggy Ashcroft, Brenda Bruce, the young Greg Doran, Estelle Kohler, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, Diana Rigg, Robert Stephens, David Suchet and Janet Suzman. Richard recalled that when he and his wife Maggie were invited to spend Christmas Day with Judi Dench and her husband <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jan/15/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">Michael Williams</a> in their tiny cottage at nearby Clifford Chambers, he had to stand in the inglenook fireplace because the ceilings were so low.</p> <p>One of Richard's less enviable tasks was to control the hordes of frequently near-riotous fans who flocked around the stage door. On one occasion, a woman who had been stalking one of the young actors for some time, turned up, demanding to see him. Richard told her that he couldn't allow her to do that, but if she cared to write a note, he would ensure that the actor received it. Her response was to make a dreadful scene, during which she attempted to slash her wrists. Such was the force of her passion that it took Richard, two stage-hands, an ambulance man and the theatre's fireman to control her. \"A very sad incident indeed,\" he reflected afterwards, \"and a lesson in obsession.\" Although he left the RSC briefly to train as a professional gardener, he found the lure of the theatre irresistible and finally retired in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>He is survived by Maggie, a theatrical dresser, and by their two children, Natasha and John.</p>",

  "<p>\"It's a monster - but one of the best,\" is how pianist <a href=\"http://www.yefimbronfman.com/\" title=\"\">Yefim Bronfman</a> described <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._2_%28Brahms%29\" title=\"\">Brahms's Second Piano Concerto</a>, the opening work in <a href=\"http://www.simonrattle.com/]\" title=\"\">Simon Rattle's</a> second Prom with the <a href=\"http://www.berliner-philharmoniker.de/en/\" title=\"\">Berlin Philharmonic</a>. \"I'm not sure you can ever truly know it,\" he added, acknowledging, perhaps, that no single interpretation can capture every facet of this enormous masterpiece.</p> <p>The shapely gravitas of Bronfman's playing suited it admirably, though on this occasion he took a few minutes to settle. Weight and scale were established at the outset. The poetry, however, seemed to work its way in as the first movement progressed. Rattle's Brahms is finessed and nuanced, and there were rapturous string climaxes and finely honed orchestral solos. The finale was expansively genial, though it's the dark urgency of Bronfman's playing in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkbZ-qSYy74\" title=\"\">Scherzo</a> and his intense treatment of the slow movement that will linger most in the memory.</p> <p>Its companion piece was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Lutos%C5%82awski\" title=\"\">Lutos\u0142awski</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._3_%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29\" title=\"\">Third Symphony</a>, another massive musical statement, the resonances of which run deep. Completed in 1983, it is often regarded as an expression of sympathy with <a href=\"http://www.gdansk-life.com/poland/solidarity\" title=\"\">Solidarity</a> in protest at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland\" title=\"\">the imposition of martial law in Poland</a>. Written in one continuous movement, the score contrasts closely wrought threnodies with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music\" title=\"\">aleatoric</a> passages in which groups of instrumentalists freely play short thematic phrases with minimal intervention from the conductor. Beethoven's Fifth, itself associated with liberation, lurks, meanwhile, behind the angry four-note theme that binds the work together.</p> <p>It benefits immensely from Rattle's trademark clarity and the Berlin Philharmonic's incisive playing, which confer tremendous lucidity on what, to me, has until now been a forbidding work, without losing sight of its innate power. When it was over, one of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Slavonic Dances formed a brief encore, which Rattle dedicated \"to the greatest audience in the world\".</p> <p>\u2022 If you're at any Prom this summer, tweet your thoughts about it to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianmusic\" title=\"\">@guardianmusic</a> using the hashtag #proms and we'll pull what you've got to say into one of our weekly roundups \u2013 or leave your comments below.</p>",
  "<p>The last decade saw the end of cheap oil, the magic growth ingredient for the global economy after the second world war. This summer's increase in maize, wheat and soya bean prices \u2013 the third spike in the past five years \u2013 suggests the era of cheap food is also over.</p> <p>Price increases in both oil and food provide textbook examples of market forces. Rapid expansion in the big emerging markets, especially China, has led to an increase in demand at a time when there have been supply constraints. For crude, these have included the war in Iraq, the embargo imposed on Iran, and the fact that some of the older fields are starting to run dry before new sources of crude are opened up.</p> <p>The same demand dynamics affect food. It is not just that the world's population is rising by 1% a year. Nor is it simply that China has been growing at 9% a year on average; it is that consumers in the big developing countries have developed an appetite for higher protein western diets. Meat consumption is rising in China, India and Brazil, and since it takes 7kg of grain to produce 1kg of beef (and 4kg to produce 1kg of pork), this is adding to global demand.</p> <p>Farmers have been getting more efficient, increasing the yields of land under production, but this has been offset by two negative factors: policies in the US and the EU that divert large amounts of corn for biofuels and poor harvests caused by the weather.</p> <p>If the World Bank's projections are anything like accurate, further massive productivity gains from agriculture are going to be needed over the next two decades. There will be an extra 70m mouths to feed every year, which will result in a 50% increase in demand for food by 2030. Meanwhile, the amount of arable land per person will continue its long-run downward trend.</p> <p>The extent of this challenge has been highlighted by the extreme drought in the US this year. Failure of the maize harvest \u2013 down by more than 100m tonnes on what was expected \u2013 has had a knock-on impact on wheat, which has not been affected by the lack of rain. Prices of both crops have jumped by $100 a tonne this summer. The latest data from the World Bank showed that food prices rose 10% between June and July and have now exceeded the previous peak in early 2011.</p> <p>It will take time for these increases to have their full impact on consumers. In the short run, the cost of meat will not be affected because there is glut caused by livestock owners slaughtering their herds in order to save money on expensive feed. But by the end of the year, food will be dearer.</p> <p>Central banks are unlikely to tighten policy in response to higher inflation, since the increase is seen as an external shock that will have a depressing effect on the spending power of consumers. They should not, however, assume that the spike will be a one-off, since grain stocks are at such low levels that bad harvests in 2013 would see rocketing prices, probably accompanied by panic-buying, export bans and food riots.</p> <p>A recent report from Oxfam said the US should expect further severe droughts in the coming decades. \"The US experienced $14bn-dollar disasters in 2011 \u2013 an historical record \u2013 including a blizzard, tornadoes, floods, a hurricane, a tropical storm, drought and heatwaves, and wildfires.\" The current year has already seen wildfires, a windstorm, heatwaves in much of the country and the most severe drought in half a century.</p> <p>This seems to be an apt moment for the west to reassess the wisdom of biofuels. The US ethanol distilleries used 120m tonnes of maize in 2011 and there have already been calls from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation for the reduced maize crop to be used for human food. There is also growing political opposition in the US to the country's Renewable Fuel Standard, which mandates 15.2bn gallons of biofuels for 2012, of which 13.4bn gallons can come from corn-based ethanol. Unsurprisingly, livestock and poultry producers have been at the forefront of calls for the mandate to be suspended.</p> <p>The whole point about biofuels was that they were supposed to be a cost-free and a pain-free way for developed nations to show that they were responding to climate change. Rising crop yields meant there would be enough grain left over each year to turn into ethanol, and this would mean western consumers could do their bit to save the planet without in any way compromising their living patterns. That now looks like a highly questionable assumption.</p> <p>So what happens next? A lasting solution to the food question will require either action on the demand side, action on the supply, or more likely both. The two obvious ways of limiting demand are to check population growth or to change dietary habits so that meat consumption is reduced. Neither is going to be easy to achieve.</p> <p>On the supply side, the short-term response should be to find alternatives to biofuels. Longer term, the hope is that the pressures of a rising population coupled with the incentives provided by rising food prices lead to a second green revolution that will dramatically increase yields in those parts of the world \u2013 such as sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 where they are currently low. One of the few beneficial impacts of high commodity prices is that farmers will be able to afford to buy fertilisers for their land.</p> <p>A recent study by Fidelity looked at some of the other recent developments to boost food supply, including precision agriculture \u2013 the use of high technology to apply the optimum amounts of seed, water and fertiliser for maximum efficiency \u2013 and a wider use of biotechnology and GM crops. The report also highlighted what is known as \"fast food\" from animal cells, a process by which scientists \"create artificial meat by delivering an electric charge to the animal muscle cells in a mixture of amino acids, which causes the cells to multiply\".</p> <p>Given the predicted growth in consumption in developing countries, Fidelity says this could become an \"environmentally acceptable option\" as traditional meat becomes more expensive. Whether this approach is \"environmentally acceptable\" remains to be seen. The Fidelity report does, however, clarify one point, namely that hard choices have to be made.</p> <p>The current assumption seems to be that the world can have a rising population, ever-higher per capita meat consumption, devote less land to food production to help hit climate change targets and eschew the advances in science that might increase yields. This is the stuff of fantasy. It is possible to have more intensive farming using the full range of technological breakthroughs in order to feed a bigger, meat-hungry population. Or it is possible to have lower yields from a more organic approach to feed a smaller population eating less meat. But not both.</p>",

Last week, Downing Street insisted it was sticking to the coalition policy not to add a new runway, despite intense pressure from the business sector and Tory backbenches to reconsider.</p> <p>Osborne said new planning legislation would be brought before parliament in the next two weeks.</p> <p>\"We will have a specific piece of legislation published next week so that government can use the low interest rates we have earned by being tough on the deficit to underwrite construction projects including housing,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked if this would mean developers would be allowed to build on green belt land, Osborne said: \"We published our national planning policy framework in March and we are not preparing to tear that up.</p> <p>\"But if you look for example at Cambridge, they have been pretty smart about swapping some bits of the green belt for other bits \u2013 in other words allowing some development on the green belt if you bring in new pieces of land into the green belt.</p> <p>\"Those powers already exist but are not widely used. I would like to see more,\" he said.</p> <p>Planning policy was thought to be a settled issue after the government backed down on plans to loosen planning rules earlier this year following a campaign by the National Trust.</p> <p>Councils are drawing up new local development plans to comply with the national planning policy framework (NPPF) by next April.</p> <p>Under plans being considered by ministers, local authorities may no longer be required to hold a public inquiry if green belt land loses its protected status.</p> <p>England's green belt covers over 6,000 sq miles of countryside around towns and cities to prevent urban sprawl.</p> <p>This week's new bill will enable the government to guarantee up to \u00a340bn of private sector investment in infrastructure.</p> <p>Treasury insiders said they were already involved in talks with 30 companies over the proposed projects, including proposals for the \u00a3600m Mersey Gateway project, a six-lane toll bridge between Widnes and Runcorn.</p> <p>A further announcement, also this week, is expected to set out plans for guaranteeing construction of new homes, with guarantees worth up to \u00a310bn.</p> <p>This will be followed by an economy bill which will set out further help including more planning reforms.</p> <p>The legislation will be fast tracked in order to ensure that detailed discussions with commercial parties can take place as soon as possible. It is expected to receive royal assent by the end of October.</p> <p>Osborne said the low level of bank lending was one of the economy's key weaknesses, and also proposed a \"small business bank\" to bring together existing schemes to boost lending to small businesses.</p> <p>The prime minister, David Cameron, is expected to announce new measures to stimulate the housing market on Thursday.</p> <p>Osborne's plans are likely to be bitterly fought inside the cabinet, with senior Liberal Democrats and the communities secretary, Eric Pickles \u2013 who negotiated the peace deal over the national planning policy framework \u2013 reportedly opposed to further changes.</p> <p>The chancellor declined to say whether the announcement was an acknowledgement that the government's economic strategy was not working. \"They are difficult times for the British economy, difficult times for the world, but our economy is healing, jobs are being created. It is taking time but there is no easy route to a magical recovery,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This country faces a big question about this country's future role in the world. I am determined that we will be in the right place at the right time to ensure that we are one of the western economies that thrives in this new world,\" he said.</p> <p>Osborne also refused to say whether he would give up his role as the Tories' senior political strategist \u2013 despite demands from backbenchers that he concentrate on the economy.</p> <p>The Tory MP for Northampton South, Brian Binley, called this weekend for Osborne to stand down from his job to concentrate on winning the next election.</p> <p>\"I am 110% focused on the economy \u2013 any changes to the cabinet will be announced by the prime minister,\" Osborne said.</p> <p>Cameron has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/02/david-cameron-cut-through-dither\" title=\"\">signalled the start of his political fightback</a> by vowing to \"cut through the dither\" that he says is holding Britain back.</p> <p>As MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Monday following the summer break, the prime minister promised a series of high-profile initiatives to get the country moving again and breathe new life into the flagging economy.</p> <p>His comments will be seen as a riposte to discontented Tory MPs who have attacked his leadership during the recess, with one senior backbencher suggesting he was a political \"mouse\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2196948/Cameron-roars-Im-mouse-launches-battle-plan-revive-ailing-economy.html\" title=\"\">Writing in the Mail on Sunday</a>, Cameron made clear he was ready to take on his critics \u2013 bringing forward controversial measures to boost growth by relaxing planning rules.</p> <p>He said the country could not afford the \"paralysis\" that caused new housing developments to be held up by entrenched local opposition and lengthy planning inquiries.</p> <p>\"A familiar cry goes up: 'Yes we want more housing, but no to every development \u2013 and not in my back yard.' The nations we're competing against don't stand for this kind of paralysis and neither must we,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"Frankly, I am frustrated by the hoops you have to jump through to get anything done \u2013 and I come back to parliament more determined than ever to cut through the dither that holds this country back.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Tory rightwinger David Davis said the government must draw up a new, alternative pro-growth strategy to get the economy moving.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9514859/Cut-tax-and-spend-less-Tory-Right-tells-George-Osborne.html\" title=\"\">interview with the Sunday Telegraph</a>, Cameron's former rival for the party leadership said a further round of spending cuts before the general election in 2015 was \"inevitable\".</p> <p>\"The coalition's cuts should have been earlier and deeper,\" he said. \"This is not about individual policy areas. This is about something more fundamental \u2026 something deeper. There is an alternative economic policy.\"</p> <p>Labour said the government's new proposals to stimulate growth showed a lack of ideas.</p> <p>Chris Leslie, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said the chancellor was desperate to cling on to his failing plan, regardless of the long-term damage the IMF had warned it risked doing to the economy.</p> <p>\"We will look closely at the details of any further changes to the planning system, including what happens to protections for the green belt. But this will not address the real reasons why construction has contracted in the last year, such as slashed public investment in housing and the lack of confidence and demand in the economy.</p> <p>\"What we need is a change of course and real action now to boost jobs and growth, including genuinely bringing forward infrastructure projects, a temporary cut in VAT and tax breaks for small firms taking on extra workers.\"</p>",

The judge ruled he should be held in police custody for two weeks.</p> <p>Police say two of his colleagues gave statements that he added pages from the Qu'ran to strengthen the case against Rimsha Masih, who has been in custody for two weeks after she was accused by Muslim neighbours in her Islamabad neighbourhood of burning the holy book.</p> <p>The crime is particularly serious under the country's much-criticised blasphemy laws and offenders can be sentenced to death.</p> <p>Maulvi Zubair and two other assistants at a mosque near Rimsha's house told police Chishti deliberately added pages from the Qu'ran to some charred refuse she was carrying.</p> <p>Zubair is said to have objected at the time but Chishti insisted it was the only way to get rid of Christians in the area.</p> <p>Rimsha's lawyers maintain that she did not commit any crime. They say that not only is she only 13 years old, and should be tried as a juvenile, she also has Down's syndrome and therefore \"cannot commit such a crime\", according to her bail application.</p> <p>Chishti has been outspoken about his dislike of the hundreds of Christian families who live in the area, even appearing on a popular national television show to complain that the noise made by Christian worshippers had disturbed Muslim residents.</p> <p>He also welcomed the departure of most of the Christians from the area following the furore surrounding the arrest of Rimsha last month. With passions running high in the community \u2013 hundreds of people demonstrated outside her house, reportedly demanding the right to burn the young girl to death \u2013 most Christians fled the area.</p> <p>\"We are not upset the Christians have left and we will be pleased if they don't come back,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/pakistan-christian-tensions-quran-burning-allegations\" title=\"\">Chishti told the Guardian</a> on 18 August.</p> <p>Tahir Naveed Chaudhry from the All Pakistan Minority Committee said Rimsha's lawyers had always maintained the evidence was planted. \"And now it is proved that the whole story was only designed to dislocate the Christian people,\" he said.</p> <p>\"[Chishti] must be prosecuted under the blasphemy law as it will set a precedent against anyone else who tries to misuse that law.\"</p> <p>The blasphemy laws have been widely abused as a powerful way to settle scores and disputes. People have been sentenced to long jail terms on extremely weak evidence, some of which cannot even be properly examined in court for fear of repeating any blasphemy.</p> <p>But public criticism of the laws is itself dangerous \u2013 two prominent politicians have been assassinated by religious hardliners after speaking out.</p> <p>Mumtaz Qadri, a former security guard who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/12/pakistan-moderate-salman-taseer-mumtaz-qadri\" title=\"\">last year gunned down his boss, Salman Taseer,</a> the governor of the Punjab at the time, is regarded by many Pakistanis as a hero for killing a man who had publicly criticised the blasphemy laws and backed a Christian woman who was sentenced to death.</p>"
