  "<p>It is eight months since the<em> Observer</em> lifted the lid on the scandal of human safaris in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/07/andaman-islands-tribe-tourism-threat\" title=\"\">Andaman Islands</a>. There was understandable outrage around the world at the appalling exploitation of the indigenous Jarawa people by a tourism industry intent only on maximising its profits, whatever the human cost. A fragile and vulnerable people were being treated as if they were exhibits in a human zoo.</p> <p>The response in Delhi was encouraging for the Jarawa and their supporters. The government of India reacted swiftly to bring in new laws to protect the tribe, policemen were arrested and the country's supreme court has banned all tourism around the jungle reserve that is home to the tribe. None of it has made the slightest difference. The safaris continue unabated.The Andaman authorities have listened to everything that has been said and have chosen to ignore it. Perhaps it will be unsurprising to learn that the islands' administration has a financial stake in the trade. But it is time they were made to understand that the survival of the Jarawa is not just a matter for them, but that it has huge importance to the wider world .</p> <p>The Indian government deserves credit for the way in which it acted swiftly to bring in new laws to protect the Jarawa. But it is in trouble, weakened by corruption allegations and lurching from crisis to crisis. It may well believe that it has bigger problems to tackle now than the fate of a small tribe on a distant island in the Bay of Bengal.</p> <p>Yet this is an ideal opportunity for it to exert its authority. Delhi has already made it very clear that it expects the Jarawa to be given the legal protection from abuse that they deserve; now it is time to impose the rule of law. The supreme court must call the bluff of those who ignore its orders and hold them to account for the contempt they have shown for the right of the Jarawa to live their lives in the privacy and security of their jungle home.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most remarkable British movies of the past couple of years, <a href=\"http://warp.net/films/berberian-sound-studio/player/video/in-cinemas-from-31-august-\" title=\"\"><em>Berberian Sound Studio</em></a><em> </em>is a psychological thriller set entirely in the Kafkaesque offices of a sleazy Italian film company in the 1970s. It brings together a gifted trio of independent British film-makers: producer Keith Griffiths, who has been behind a dozen or more daring, offbeat pictures, including most recently the Cannes Palme d'Or winner <em>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</em>; the cinematographer Nic Knowland, whose numerous credits since the late 1970s include Tony Palmer's Shostakovich biography <em>Testimony</em> and the Quay brothers' <em>Institute Benjamenta</em>; and writer-director Peter Strickland, a&#xa0;truly European director who made&#xa0;his&#xa0;feature debut in Hungary three years ago with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/oct/11/katalin-varga-film-review\" title=\"\"><em>Katalin Varga</em></a>.</p> <p>The low-budget <em>Katalin Varga</em>, shot in Romania in Hungarian, tells the story of a peasant woman embarking on a <em>Virgin Spring</em>-style revenge trip around the Carpathians after being banished from her native village. The most notable feature is its complex soundtrack combining electronic music, an indecipherable chorus of human voices, and slightly heightened natural sounds of wind, water, thunder and the rustling of grass and leaves. This is important because in Strickland's second film, <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em>, the protagonist is a shy, nondescript British sound expert, and he has two cinematic predecessors. In Francis Coppola's <em>The Conversation </em>(1974), Gene Hackman played a San Francisco surveillance expert hired to make secret recordings of conspiratorial lovers, who gets out of his depth and descends into paranoia. In Brian De Palma's <em>Blow Out </em>(1981) John Travolta had one of his best roles as an ace sound-effects man working on a low-budget horror flick in Philadelphia who stumbles across a political conspiracy. He ends up recording the screams of a dying woman and uses them to dub a slasher film.</p> <p>Coppola and De Palma were of course influenced by Antonioni's <em>Blow-Up</em> (1966), and Strickland refers specifically to Ingmar Bergman and David Lynch in <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em>. The short, balding Toby Jones, one of the cinema's finest character actors at work today, plays the middle-aged Gilderoy, a home counties dork from Dorking brought to Italy to construct a soundtrack. His speciality, according to a persuasive clip we're shown, is providing the natural sounds of winds, birdcalls and rippling brooks for British natural history films. They're narrated by plummy-voiced actors with snatches of Vaughan Williams's <em>The</em> <em>Lark Ascending </em>in the background. The Berberian Studio specialises in something different: the stylish, sadistic, sexually explicit horror movies of the 1970s known as \"giallo\" because of the garish yellow-covered paperbacks from which they were adapted; these were especially associated with such directors as Mario Bava, Luciano Ercoli, Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Gilderoy's encounter with a sullen, aggressive, dark-haired beauty at the reception establishes the unwelcoming, mysteriously foreign nature of the place, as well as his identity as an innocent, unworldly mother's boy. He starts off making the first of many unsuccessful requests for his airfare, a decreasingly unfunny joke as the movie goes on.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-392211312\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/6/26/120626Berberian-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/6/26/120626Berberian_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120626Berberian/120626Berberian.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/6/26/120626Berberian-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/6/26/120626Berberian_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>The prissy Gilderoy is at first surprised and intrigued by this giallo world. We see the graphic red and black credit titles of \"The Equestrian Vortex\" depicting satanic scenes preceding the outrageous movie that the menacingly flamboyant, flashily dressed and extravagantly coiffed producer Francesco Coraggio and the director Giancarlo Santini have made. But only through Gilderoy's eyes do we experience the outrageous horrors (rape, mutilation, torture and terror) for which he must provide sound effects as well as recording the dialogue and screams of the attractive young starlets in their cramped sound booth. He keeps in touch with Dorking through his mother's letters of village activities, and is flattered by the significance attached to his contribution by his new employers and the attentions of the attractive actresses. His absorption in special effects (sizzling fat to accompany a red-hot poker penetrating a nun's vagina; a crushed marrow to capture the final sound of a plummeting body) keeps their true nature at bay. But gradually the deference of producer and director&#xa0;turns into contempt, especially when they take personally Gilderoy's criticisms of the studio's penny-pinching equipment, and when&#xa0;he dares to impugn the integrity&#xa0;of their artistic vision.</p> <p>Jones, Strickland and the cinematographer Knowland brilliantly capture the hermetic atmosphere of a place where it's impossible to tell day from night. A pervasive mood of exploitation and corruption seeps from the films being made into the relationships between everyone involved in their making. First gradually, then suddenly, Gilderoy becomes a part of this nightmare factory and its product. He's unable to distinguish between the vicious fantasies he himself has helped create and so-called reality, and we come to realise that his carefully protected home counties existence is itself an idyllic fantasy.</p> <p>Strickland is clearly making a moral judgment on film-making and popular culture, but it's more than a little ambivalent, and he's also fascinated by the process of creation, representation and self-deception. There are wonderfully funny scenes and rather beautiful moments like the one in which Gilderoy proudly exhibits his skills by creating the sound of a UFO with a wire brush during a candle-lit power failure, a sequence that resembles a painting of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_an_Air_Pump_by_Joseph_Wright_of_Derby,_1768.jpg\" title=\"\">an 18th-century scientific experiment</a> by that master of light, Joseph Wright of Derby. If you sit through the final credits you'll read that Suzy Kendall, one-time wife&#xa0;of Dudley Moore, is listed as \"special guest screamer\". Kendall appeared in several 1970s horror flicks, most famously Dario Argento's seminal giallo classic, <em>The Bird With the Crystal Plumage </em>(1970).</p>",
  "<p>Few private eye novels would open, as <em>The Drowning Pool</em> does, with a poison-pen letter quoting from Shakespeare's sonnet 94 (\"Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds\"), but in Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer series urbane literary allusion is par for the course. Macdonald, whose real name was Kenneth Millar, published his first Archer novel in 1949, after completing a PhD on Coleridge at the University of Michigan. <em>The Drowning Pool</em>, set in California and first&#xa0;published in 1950, is Archer's second outing and the most formally assured of the series.</p> <p>After investigating an anonymous note accusing the wealthy Maude Slocum of adultery, Archer dives deep into a case that turns murderous when Maude's domineering mother-in-law, Olivia (\"She had enough ego to equip a dictator and leave enough over for a couple of gauleiters\"), is found dead in her swimming pool. Is oil magnate Walter Kilbourne, desirous to drill for black gold on the Slocum estate, responsible or is the killing merely a domestic spat gone wrong?</p> <p>Macdonald unfurls his plot with the unforced majesty of an incoming Pacific tide, though it is in his laconic descriptive prose that he equals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/raymondchandler\" title=\"\">Chandler</a> or Hammett. His evocation of Kilbourne's shadowy fiefdom \u2013 \"The&#xa0;place was as noisy as a funeral parlour at midnight, and I liked it just as well\" \u2013 in the LA hills testifies to a prescient postwar cynicism about American corporatism, while his description of a club's faded grandeur echoes with chiastic irony: \"The photographs that lined the panelled walls were signed by all the big names and the names that had once been big.\"</p> <p>A noirish, centrifugal amorality pervades Archer's world and <em>The Drowning Pool</em> does not conclude nicely or neatly. Yet this narrative ambiguity affirms the complexity of Macdonald's fiction, for as Archer observes bitterly at the denouement: \"The happy endings and the biggest oranges were the ones that California saved for export.\"</p>",
  "<p>An inquiry into a police shooting in which a man was shot at close range six times in a London street will this week see British intelligence officials questioned in public for the first time.</p> <p>Azelle Rodney, 24, was shot by an officer \u2013 identified in preceedings only as E7 \u2013 as he sat in the rear of a Volkswagen Golf in Edgware, north London in 2005. A public inquiry will open on Monday to establish the circumstances that led to his death and address questions from his mother, Susan Alexander, who says she still does not know why the officer considered her son such a risk as to shoot him dead.</p> <p>It is expected to lead to recommendations that could determine the future of police operations that are based on long-term surveillance and the use of intelligence resources.</p> <p>The police shooting of another man, Mark Duggan, 29, in north London triggered last year's riots. Inquest, a campaigning charity, also draws parallels to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, who was shot dead by police at Stockwell tube station in July 2005, also as the result of a pre\u2011planned police operation. The Rodney inquiry, expected to last eight weeks, will this week see two intelligence officers from HM Revenue and Customs and three from Scotland Yard cross-examined over the information that led to the car being intercepted by firearms officers. It is understood the customs intelligence officers were monitoring a gang importing cocaine when they picked up information about a planned armed robbery, which they passed to intelligence officials at Scotland Yard.</p> <p>The officers have agreed to be questioned in public on the quality of the intelligence, its content and reliability, and how it led to the operation. The only restriction is that they must not reveal how it was obtained. They will speak to the court behind a screen to protect their anonymity.</p> <p>Intelligence desk operatives rather than intelligence officers usually appear in court, and almost always in closed court \u2013 as is the case with the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac), the most secret court within English law, which has the power to detain foreign terrorism suspects without trial. Siac's hearings and rulings are never fully revealed to the public because they involve testimony from members of the secret security services. The counsel to the inquiry, Ashley Underwood QC who has considerable experience of Siac hearings, told the <em>Observer</em>: \"This is the first time actual intelligence officers will appear in court.</p> <p>\"Normally you have second-hand evidence from a desk operative; here, the officers will be appearing in person to be cross-examined, the raw intelligence itself will be open to scrutiny.\" The officer fired eight shots of which a number struck Rodney in the head. Guns were subsequently found in the car and the two men in the front, Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, were jailed in 2006 for possession of firearms and ammunition.</p> <p>Previous inquiries into the shooting include one by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which found no evidence of misconduct and by the Crown Prosecution Service, which concluded that there was \"insufficient evidence\" to offer a realistic prospect of convicting any officer.</p>",
  "<p>Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg is supposedly one of the world's shrewdest traders, so he'll be acutely aware of the choice facing him this week: either he performs a humiliating volte-face by increasing his bid for the mining group Xstrata, or he must risk never having complete control of an asset so coveted that he was prepared to put his notoriously secretive company through the irritation of a public listing to get it.</p> <p>We will know which trade-off he's plumped for by Friday, when Xstrata shareholders are due to vote on Glencore's plan to combine the pair into a \u00a353bn natural resources giant \u2013 although the latest opinion polls suggest the scheme is set for a comprehensive defeat.</p> <p>Still, there remains a chance that Glasenberg will sacrifice his reputation to land the prize (and save Xstrata's obedient board from the vengeance of their own shareholders). But should Glasenberg be considering a late increase to his bid, then he needs to be reminded of the perils of dawdling.</p> <p>As a young man, the commodity trader almost competed as a speed-walker in the 1984 Olympics. Apartheid meant that his native South Africa was barred from the games but, with his Jewish ancestry, he sought to go as an Israeli. Sadly, Glasenberg failed to complete his paperwork in time.</p> <h2>Rising quiche but falling sales at Morrisons</h2> <p>In one of his adverts for the supermarket chain Morrisons, England cricket hero Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff takes a bunch of young children on a shopping trip for a party. As they fill up the trolley with hearty favourites such as joints of British beef, hot cross buns and cupcakes, Freddie suddenly stops his group on the way to the checkout and asks: \"Did you get the quiche?\"</p> <p>It is hardly the worst gag you'll be subjected to in a supermarket commercial (that remains the most fiercely competitive field in the industry) but the supposed joke of a lad from Preston fancying such fare now seems to be on the retailer.</p> <p>The company unveils its interim results this week with City analysts expecting dire numbers, including falling like-for-like sales.</p> <p>Among the criticisms are the usual concerns about the chain's lack of online shopping and convenience stores, as well as the Bradford-based grocer suddenly appearing to have abandoned its core customer by trying to become too posh. Veg counters spewing out dry ice seem the most obvious irritant \u2013 meaning (to butcher another of the group's old ads) there are fewer reasons to shop at Morrisons.</p> <h2>How long have we got to save the euro now?</h2> <p>In January 2011, Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n reckoned there was six months to \"save the euro\". By June, the schedule still held, as a meeting between Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel and France's then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, prompted headlines hinting there was just \"45 minutes\" to do the same. So we should perhaps be mildly sceptical in 2012 about suggestions that European Central Bank president Mario Draghi now has two weeks to try again.</p> <p>Still, having promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the currency in July, Draghi now faces an important fortnight in which he needs to justify bondholders' recent optimism that he's managed to unearth a plausible euro solution while on his summer holidays. The next two weeks potentially will see fresh ECB bond-buying measures, a Spanish plea for aid, plus clues about whether the market will raise its boot from Greece's throat and ease the terms of its bailout. Meanwhile, German judges and Dutch voters will also get a say on the currency's future (or otherwise).</p> <p>Amid all that, Draghi convenes the ECB's governing council on Thursday, with analysts daring to dream he'll utter the magic word \"unlimited\". That's as in ECB intervention, not supposed deadlines.</p> <h2>Making a marque</h2> <p>They used to say that Range Rovers had heated rear windscreens to keep their owners' hands warm as they pushed them home, but the marque's reputation has been transformed since then.</p> <p>Nowadays Jaguar Land Rover, which makes the beasts, is lauded as that highly unusual case of a British manufacturing success story (albeit one that, rather less unusually, is foreign owned).</p> <p>The company has recently hired an extra 1,000 workers at its Halewood plant in Merseyside to launch a three-shift, 24-hour operation - as the carmaker attempts to satisfy demand for its new Range Rover Evoque, which is very popular despite a tie-up with Victoria Beckham.</p> <p>This week will also see the manufacturer unveil its latest line, \"the all new Range Rover\", a model made in Solihull and which the company boasts \"has delivered significant enhancements in performance and agility\". That's more than can be said for British manufacturing, as yet another depressing purchasing managers' index is expected to show tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Just over two months ago, the small Dutch community of Almelo woke up to a tragedy that turned out to have national repercussions. On a modest street in a rundown area, Aziz Kara, a 64-year-old Turk, became embroiled in a ferocious argument with his neighbours. When he was struck to the ground, the impact of the blow put him into a coma. Ten days later Kara died of a brain haemorrhage.</p> <p>In normal circumstances, the death would have preoccupied only the local media. But as the Netherlands prepares for its second national election in two years, Kara's case was different. When relatives and the local community organised a silent march through the streets of Almelo, politicians and mourners came from The Hague and across the country. National newspaper columns were devoted to the incident, which quickly became a PR disaster for arguably the most influential far-right politician in the European Union, Geert Wilders.</p> <p>To Wilders's acute discomfort, the man who allegedly beat Kara to the ground was called Henk. And his wife \u2013 who apparently shouted racist abuse at the victim on the ground \u2013 was called Ingrid. The resonance of the names was lost on no one. In the last two years, the Netherlands has learned to live with another \"Henk and Ingrid\" \u2013 a fictional couple born of Wilders's own populist imagination. Just as Basildon man and Worcester woman became stars of elections in Britain, Wilders's blue-collar caricatures were successfully deployed to voice the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam sentiments of his Freedom party (PVV). \"Henk and Ingrid are sick of paying for Ali and Fatima,\" went one anti-immigrant slogan.</p> <p>After Kara's death that didn't sound so good. \"Henk and Ingrid are real,\" tweeted one TV personality. \"And they just killed someone in Almelo.\"</p> <p>Wilders has since dropped all reference to Henk and Ingrid. But the backlash against the PVV after the killing indicated that its culture war with Islam is no longer making the political weather in Holland. Wilders, the divisive, charismatic showman of national politics, is projected to take only 18 of the 150 available parliamentary seats on 12&#xa0;September, well down from 24 two years ago.</p> <p>\"Those Wilders cultural themes are not dominating the public debate,\" said Chris Aalberts, a cultural historian at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. \"The big election issues right now are economic \u2013 health, social security \u2026 and Europe\".</p> <p>It is a change that could have huge consequences for the eurozone's political landscape at a delicate moment. For control of the Oranje zeitgeist has not returned to the handful of mainstream national parties which traditionally form coalitions in the Hague. Instead, as austerity bites hard even in this prosperous northern bastion of the eurozone, the newest political insurgency to sweep the Netherlands is coming from the radical left.</p> <p>The Dutch Socialist party (SP) is an organisation once known for its Maoist sympathies and habit of throwing tomatoes at political opponents. It now finds itself within touching distance of becoming the biggest parliamentary force, eclipsing its more moderate rivals in the Labour party and on course to gain at least 30 parliamentary seats. Just as the unexpected success of the leftwing Syriza party in beleaguered Greece set alarm bells ringing in Brussels, the SP has become another surprise package of European politics at a time when more centrist politicians seem to lack ideas.</p> <p>While Wilders's party made its name through divisive ideas such as a tax on Muslim headscarves, a favourite SP slogan reads: \"There's enough to go round for everyone.\" But that inclusive message is intended to carry menacing implications for bankers, business and the EU powerbrokers of Brussels. Anti-austerity and exasperated by endless eurozone bailouts, the SP's leader, Emile Roemer, 50, has pledged to abandon the government's plan to bring the budget deficit below 3% by 2013, largely through healthcare cuts and wage freezes, and face down German chancellor Angela Merkel and the European commission if they object.</p> <p>Conservative plans to extend the retirement age from 65 to 67 would also be torn up. And in an echo of French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's intention to raise more money from the very rich, income tax would be raised from 52% to 65% on those earning above \u00a3119,000 a year. A public investment programme, partly financed by the proceeds, would be aimed at turning around the ailing Dutch economy.</p> <p>For an avuncular former teacher, known for a toothy smile and sometimes nicknamed \"Fozzie Bear\", it adds up to an uncompromising platform designed to cause palpitations in both the Amsterdam stock exchange and European commission corridors.</p> <p>On Europe, Roemer has still more to say. A eurozone banking union has been ruled out, as has the so-called European stability mechanism (ESM), which would allow fines to be imposed on countries refusing to maintain balanced budgets. There would be no more Dutch agreement to bailouts of Greece, or any other country.</p> <p>For a once-marginal party that used to stay out of parliamentary politics, this twin strategy \u2013 targeting cuts at home and bailouts abroad \u2013 has struck a deafening chord. The Netherlands no longer feels like a safe haven in the eurozone storm. In May, the European commission predicted that the economy would contract by nearly 1% this year. House prices are falling at an alarming rate and in July the rating agency Moody's publically contemplated a downgrade of the country's cherished triple A rating on government debt.</p> <p>Many voters have had enough. In one poll, some 70% expressed a preference for greater economic stimulus and fewer cuts in 2013. Another survey found that only 58% of Dutch people were now in favour of EU membership, compared with 76% in 2010, a drop that represents a major wobble in one of the founder members of the EU.</p> <p>Over a few months, the mild-mannered Roemer has transformed the political debate. Prime minister Mark Rutte has taken to warning that an SP-led government would imperil the country. \"The SP has the economic themes,\" said Aalberts. \"And the foreigners Dutch people are concerned with at the moment are Polish and Greek, not Muslim.\"</p> <p>There was ample evidence of that at the Wesselerbrink market in Enschede, where the SP was doing a thriving trade in symbolic foam \"protest\" tomatoes, handed out to passersby in one of the city's poorer areas. In this eastern city, which boasts a proud industrial heritage but has a highly uncertain future, the talk among the shoppers was of medical charges, money worries and the malign influence of Brussels bureaucrats and profligate Greeks.</p> <p>\"I worked until I was 43,\" said Kim Bozuwa, who needs a \"scootmobile\" to get around. \"Then I smashed my kneecap in a fall. I've also got diabetes. If the Conservatives win, I'm going to have to pay far more in payments for my medical care. Why? It's not as if I can choose whether to have the medication or not.\"</p> <p>Lillian, a pensioner who has lived in Enschede most of her life, was also contemplating a vote for the SP. \"I've already got a reduced pension thanks to the crisis,\" she said. \"I can't see why we should take orders from Brussels to cut our living standards. Half of the bureaucrats there do nothing that's any use to anyone and half are on the make. It's an elite mafia. And the Greeks lied to enter the eurozone. They altered their figures to make sure they got in.\"</p> <p>Wim Kooiker, a market regular, echoed her sentiments and went a step further. \"The Netherlands should get out of the EU. First it was Greece that needs the bailouts, then Spain, soon it will be Italy and then it will be France. We should get out and so should England!\"</p> <p>This month promises to be tumultuous for the eurozone. On the same day that the Dutch vote, a German constitutional court will rule on the legality of a formal rescue fund for euro members, amid mounting fears of a Greek exit. An anti-austerity uprising in the Netherlands would add to the sense that Europe's policymaking elite has lost its way.</p> <p>Could it happen? With no experience in national government, Roemer struggled in the opening televised debates. It is possible that even if the SP scores a resounding success at the polls, centrist parties will combine to ensure it is excluded from any coalition. But the message of the Dutch election campaign of 2012 is unmistakable. In yet another eurozone country, a huge disconnection has emerged between popular sentiment among voters and the policy consensus maintained by a beleaguered political elite.</p> <p>In Greece, Syriza and its leader, Alexis Tsipras, drew the benefit. In Italy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/21/parma-mayor-pizzarotti-beppe-grillo\" title=\"\">a maverick comic named Beppe Grillo</a> has become the most popular political figure around. In Holland, a temptation to ditch austerity and go it alone is changing a political landscape dominated for 10 years by multiculturalism and race.</p> <p>As the owner of an engineering company in Enschede, Uulke Visser makes for an unusual SP activist. Unsurprisingly, he admits to a sense of excitement as an extraordinary campaign comes to a climax. \"This party stands for the opposite of 'what's in it for me?'. It's about investing in people and their prospects. Here in the Netherlands we have a group of people who are getting desperate. They're asking, 'Is this all we can expect?'. And they're thinking things will only get worse. It could yet be the biggest moment in the history of the Socialist party.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the traditional August lull, there is foreboding in Brussels and other European capitals about what lies ahead for the euro in the autumn. In what promises to be a momentous few weeks, the spotlight will fall first on Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, who is expected to unveil intervention moves in Frankfurt on Thursday aimed at capping borrowing costs for Spain and Italy and preventing the crisis spiralling out of control.</p> <p>Draghi faces the wrath of Germany's Bundesbank, which is withering about his plan to intervene in the secondary markets to buy up sovereign debt and prevent Rome's and Madrid's borrowing costs becoming unaffordable. Whether this will work is in doubt. Previous ECB interventions \u2013 buying Italian bonds last summer or flooding EU banks with cheap three-year loans \u2013 brought temporary respite for the currency, but no durable resolution.</p> <p>The Draghi proposals will also come hedged with caveats and conditions that will delay ECB action, in effect piling the pressure on the eurozone's political leaders to take the primary role in dealing with the crisis.</p> <p>A few days later, on 12 September, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, will deliver his annual state of the union speech to the European parliament as Brussels tables a draft law on a radical new regime for supervising and regulating eurozone banks. This represents a quantum leap in the way the EU is run, for the first time putting the eurozone's banks \u2013 at issue is how many of them \u2013 under the authority of the ECB, a massive increase in the central bank's powers.</p> <p>The \"banking union\" is supposed to be the first step, followed by a fiscal union and ultimately a eurozone political union, in effect leading to a much more integrated eurozone political federation within a decade. This is roughly the German vision of where things are going or should go. The problems are immense. The arguments will be bitter.</p> <p>Also on 12 September, the election in the Netherlands will reveal the extent to which Euroscepticism has grown among the Dutch, while Germany's supreme court will rule whether the eurozone's new permanent \u20ac500bn bailout fund, the ESM, is compatible with German law. It was supposed to start operating in July.</p> <p>After this, the spotlight will turn to Greece and whether, following months of political paralysis, it is doing enough to meet the terms of its second bailout, whether it needs more money \u2013 in effect, a third bailout \u2013 and whether it is able to stay in the euro at all.</p> <p>The European fiscal and budgetary police force known as the \"troika\" \u2013 and to the Greeks as \"the men in black\" \u2013 will descend on Athens this week to go through the books amid pleas from the Greeks that they need more time, and therefore more money, to meet the debt and deficit reduction targets imposed as the price of the bailouts.</p> <p>There is little stomach across the eurozone for a third bailout, but there are also growing signs of nervousness at the impact a Greek exit from the euro would have.</p> <p>In under three years of euro crisis, there have been umpteen \"make-or-break\" and \"last-chance\" moments for the currency, usually resulting in muddling through, doing just enough to gain a little more time, delaying the denouement to the Greek and the broader European drama.</p> <p>How long that strategy can survive is anyone's guess, but the sense in Brussels is that the stakes are rising and between now and Christmas the euro's fate will probably be decided.</p> <p>The most tired clich\u00e9 in European affairs is the transport metaphor invariably used to describe the relationship between Berlin and Paris \u2013 the Franco-German \"motor, \"engine\", \"tandem\", \"axis\". It remains truer than ever, however, that there can be no durable fix to the crisis without an accommodation between Angela Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>Since Hollande was elected in May, he has mounted one challenge after another to Merkel's authority, climaxing in June when he sided with Italy and Spain to defeat the Germans at an EU summit.</p> <p>Both sides acknowledged last week that things can't go on like this, agreeing to set up a high-powered working group to deliver common policies with both countries' finance ministers meeting fortnightly.</p> <p>The Germans and the French remain far apart on policy, on how to fix the crisis and on the overall political future of the EU and the eurozone.</p> <p>But the new arrangements will necessarily produce compromises for the long haul of gradually building a more integrated eurozone federation.

  "<p>Bob Diamond may have represented the showy, swashbuckling side of Barclays, but his successor, Antony Jenkins, is a reminder of its humbler, more boring roots, as a plain old deposit-taking high street bank. Where the US-born Diamond was smooth, unrepentantly proud of Barclays' record and desperate for the bank to hold its own against the likes of Goldman Sachs, Jenkins is quietly spoken, forged his reputation on the retail side \u2013 and quickly dropped Diamond's ambitious targets for boosting return on equity.</p> <p>Jenkins has a tough task restoring the bank's reputation and rebuilding shattered relationships with regulators and politicians, against the background of twin Serious Fraud Office probes over Libor-rigging and payments to Qatari investors in 2008.</p> <p>But he will also have to confront the question of what Barclays is for. Does it still cling to the dreams of Wall Street glory that saw Diamond slurp up the dregs of Lehman Brothers at the height of the crisis? Or does Jenkins's appointment signal an intention to make savings, loans and mortgages the heart of the business?</p> <p>Of course, Barclays is not the only British bank forced to face such a dilemma: Jenkins's appointment marks the final stage in the wholesale clearout of the top echelons of the financial sector that started with Northern Rock's woefully out-of-his-depth boss Adam Applegarth in December 2007.</p> <p>Investment banking, which seemed like a licence to print money, has become less profitable as regulators impose higher capital requirements on riskier activities. All the major banks are slimming down their investment banking operations, and selling off some of the other businesses they plunged into during the boom years \u2013 such as, in Royal Bank of Scotland's case, aircraft leasin.</p> <p>Jenkins has stressed his allegiance to \"universal banking\"; but he might do well to heed the words of Andy Haldane, one of the Bank of England's biggest brains, who argued this weekend that banks might be wise to \"make a virtue of necessity\" and hive off their investment banking arms.</p> <p>Much of the typically erudite speech Haldane delivered at the Jackson Hole meeting of the world's central bankers was aimed at regulators. He urged them to ditch 50 years of received wisdom and keep things simple, instead of imposing ever more complex rules, such as the byzantine Basel framework of capital requirements \u2013 the \"tower of Basel\", as he called it.</p> <p>He compared the task of regulators trying to keep track of financial institutions with a dog trying to catch a frisbee. Research has apparently shown \u2013 Haldane's the kind of person who keeps up with these things \u2013 that a dog (and indeed a person) catches a Frisbee by following a simple rule: \"run at a speed so that the angle of gaze to the Frisbee remains roughly constant\". So regulators would do better to concentrate on a few rules of thumb \u2013 such as \"more leveraged banks are more risky\" \u2013 rather than a battery of mind-boggling models.</p> <p>But Haldane had advice for banks, too: he ended his speech by pointing out that in the 1930s the Glass-Steagall regulation that imposed a clean cut between retail and investment banking in the US was only implemented after some banks including the two largest, responded to their sickly valuations on the equity markets by splitting themselves up. \"Bankers today, many cursed and condemned, could make a virtue of necessity. The market could lead where regulators have feared to tread,\" he said.</p> <p>Barclays' valuation will inevitably be seen as one metric of Jenkins's performance. If, like Haldane, he believes that simple is better, he could split the bank in two, and make Barclays a world leader \u2013 but not in quite the way Diamond had in mind.</p> <h2>Russian retreat is about gas prices, not Greenpeace</h2> <p>Greenpeace might think that it has scored a victory with the Russians scrapping their flagship Shtokman gas project in the Arctic, but the Vladimir Putin-approved decision is motivated by money, not the environment.</p> <p>State-owned Gazprom insists that Shtokman is postponed, not forever binned, and it remains in talks with Shell and other foreign investors about trying to resurrect the project, although over-optimism has been a constant here for decades \u2013 until last week.</p> <p>The axe finally fell just days after Greenpeace had taken its first piece of direct action against Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya platform in a different part of the Arctic, so it is hardly surprising the green group wanted to claim victory. But Shtokman has been in trouble for the last couple of years, ever since the shale gas \"revolution\" got properly under way in North America, sending gas prices there spinning downwards.</p> <p>Gazprom originally expected to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship to a new series of import terminals being constructed in the US, only to find the market turned on its head. America is now looking at using those terminals for export and there is such an energy glut that gas shale drillers are packing their rigs up and looking for new opportunities. At the same time massive new finds have been made in locations such as Mozambique, while the European gas market has also been in retreat for suppliers, not because of cheap prices but because the credit crunch has reduced demand considerably.</p> <p>None of this has been good news for Gazprom. Bringing gas out of the seabed was always going to be technically complex and very expensive. The costs at Shtokman ranged between $15bn and $20bn, depending on who you talked to. Gazprom's foreign partners said Shtokman needed big tax breaks from Moscow to make it work, but even Putin could see that this scheme of \"global significance\" \u2013 as he called it \u2013 did not make sense under those circumstances and refused to help out.</p> <p>The Arctic might hold nearly a quarter of the world's remaining hydrocarbon reserves but the Shtokman retreat, coming after Cairn Energy's drilling failures off Greenland, is a reminder that for the time being at least, the financial, as well as the environmental, costs may be too high.</p> <h2>Aussies exposed as Chinese dragon runs out of puff</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395510460\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346438145360/David-Simonds-Australia-C-010.jpg\" alt=\"David Simonds Australia China 02.09.12\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cartoon by David Simonds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aside from a reputation for being seriously laid back, it's hard to see much in common between the Australians and the Dutch. But a growing number of economists are pointing out that our friends down under are suffering a classic case of \"Dutch disease\".</p> <p>Australia's economy has built a monster boom by selling natural resources such as iron ore and coking coal to the mighty Chinese. A full quarter of Australia's exports go to China.</p> <p>But just as in the Netherlands after vast gas reserves were discovered in the late 1950s, natural resources can be a curse as well as a blessing. They drive up the value of the currency, hollow out other industries by making their goods uncompetitive on world markets, and create an economy dangerously exposed to swings in the global commodity cycle.</p> <p>For Australia, it's looking increasingly as though the good years are over. A sharp fall in the price of iron ore \u2013 down a whopping 30% since July \u2013 is being widely read as a signal that China's economy is slowing and that its demand for resources is not as insatiable as some analysts had claimed. Even the legendarily cheerful Aussies may struggle to keep their equanimity in the face of a Chinese crash.</p>",
  "<p>There were 15,000 journalists in Tampa covering Mitt Romney's coronation. But what did they do, apart from eat, fill out expenses claims and watch a pre-packed TV spectacle with even less primetime exposure than ever? Well, they could fact-check the wilder shores of GOP rhetoric (a great growth industry) but that still left 14,500 with not much to do. So why, if Gary Lineker and the two Alans can cover a European football championship in the Ukraine from Salford Quays, does anyone need to go near a conference hall again? Ask yourself that in Charlotte this week; or perhaps as the Lib Dems pack for Brighton.</p>",
  "<p>While Sly Bailey was in charge of Trinity Mirror, its shares slid 90%. While her freshly promulgated successor, Simon Fox, was in charge of HMV, its shares fell 98%. Yet Fox's appointment is greeted with enthusiasm on the exchanges. Trinity shares promptly rise 5%. Discuss \u2013 or rather, scratch your head.</p> <p>Maybe the hope of innovative thinking is what it's about. Sly wasn't an innovator: she simply cut costs and then ran out of road. But for easy riders on the City carousel, Fox looks rather more interesting \u2013 probably because the industry parallels seem so pat.</p> <p>Take a business losing 10% of its sales year after year. The recession is hurting, but it's digital that brings the most relentless pain. Simply, the wonders of online are killing your basic products: CDs, DVDs and books. Do you just sit there and shut more shops? Or do you try to reinvent yourself as a broader entertainment brand \u2013 selling tickets, owning venues and clubs, running festivals, managing musicians \u2013 and go determinedly digital yourself?</p> <p>We could, in crude outline, be talking about the dilemma of any big newspaper operation (and Fox has been a non-exec at Guardian Media Group for two years). The hope is that he can give Trinity Mirror the kiss of life he sought to bring to HMV. But the parallels don't stop there. Why has what appeared to be a promising way forward stalled, with all those venues and Waterstones sold off, and engines of transformation put on hold? Because profits have shrunk; because sales are down 20%; because HMV's debt meant something desperate \u2013 like asking suppliers to invest \u2013 had to be done.</p> <p>Ah! we could be talking papers again, as print advertising slumps faster than digital grows and pension-fund overhangs increase. Fox will need to get very innovative indeed. But broad brushes will also need to get more discriminating. How much is Trinity's gloom, especially at national level, exacerbated by years of inert non-investment? Are DVDs and words on paper utterly comparable? Fox didn't think so when he talked about books. \"Unlike music, the book is not a broken product: the book is a fabulous product,\" he once declared (before selling Waterstones).</p> <p>And discrimination also means taking fashionable assumptions case by case. Look at the plight of the regional press Fox now joins. Year-on-year circulation drops of 10% are common in the latest six-monthly ABC figures. But there's still a research project lurking amid so much gloom. Take the <em>Exmouth Herald</em> and the <em>Goole Courier</em>. Ponder the <em>Alloa Advertiser</em>, the <em>Coalville Mail</em> and the <em>Bucks Free Press</em>. These are just some of the titles that kept losses under 3%. Some, indeed, finished more or less even over a brutal 12 months. Many made decent money. They must be doing something right.

Another, unnamed, executive calls it \"excoriating\".</p> <p>Well, we shall see if fairness and balance follow in a separate envelope; but meanwhile LJL is described as \"disappointed\" that his comments \"are being openly discussed in the press\".

  "<p>Ladies and gentlemen of this very ad hoc jury \u2026 Let us consider the Question of the Epic Boobs \u2013 in conjunction, naturally enough, with the matter of Danni Minogue's early pregnancy. We'll inevitably come to Harry and strip billiards, but meanwhile the Press Complaints Commission book of what may be deemed relevant case law is open wide.</p> <p>Ms Minogue, you may remember, complained to the PCC because the <em>Daily Mirror</em> and <em>Daily Record</em> broke the news that she was having a baby much too early for comfort, certainty or taste. They said that they'd seen it on a blog and the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> website. The commission promptly slapped them down. \"Our code specifically requires us 'to have regard to the extent to which the information has previously appeared. This is no more than common sense: otherwise any reference online would represent automatic justification for a newspaper to print otherwise intrusive material.\"</p> <p>But when the woman with \"epic boobs\" found some pictures she'd posted on a social networking site downloaded by <em>Loaded</em> magazine and used in a rather tatty competition to identify her, she too went to the PCC \u2013 and got a different result. Hold on to that word \"extent\" because entering the word \"boobs\" on Google produced 1,760,000 matches related to her and 203,000 image matches as the \"Epic Boobs\" girl. \"The commission had to pay regard to the extent to which the information had already been made available, and also the context in which it appeared. It judged that it would not have been proportionate to criticise an editor for republishing this material, bearing in mind how \u2013 and how far \u2013 it had already spread\".</p> <p>It's difficult to see any successor body to the PCC, statutory or not, coming to a vastly different conclusion about the \"extent\" of the problem here. Nobody knows whether St James's Palace, which has three months to decide whether to make a formal complaint over Harry's Las Vegas antics, will do so. Nobody can tell whether 3,600 emails and letters from members of the public will trigger an inquiry anyway. And nobody can predict whether the PCC will be around long enough to complete such an investigation or offer meaningful redress. But if you Google something simple, say \"Prince Harry photos\", you'll get 254,000,000 results: which, deep down, is the extent of everyone's problem.</p>",
  "<p>Each nugget of data about the health of the American housing market or the mood of its consumers will be eagerly seized upon and carefully spun by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the coming weeks, as they fight to prove they should be trusted to run the world's largest economy. The US has shrugged off the after-effects of the sub-prime downturn more effectively than the eurozone, and is certainly in ruder health than the stagnating UK, expanding at an annual rate of 1.7% according to <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm\" title=\"\">the latest numbers</a>.</p> <p>Yet the background music for what promises to be a closely fought presidential campaign is of a country less certain than for many years of its place in the world \u2013 hamstrung by public and private debt; anxious about the disappearance of traditional jobs to low-cost markets overseas; worn down by a prolonged period in which living standards for middle America have moved sideways. If the <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18315\" title=\"\">latest analysis</a> by the US economist Robert Gordon is correct, America's voters have every reason to be concerned \u2013 not just about whether the economy can weather the slowdown in China and Europe over the next 12 months, but about its growth prospects for decades to come. At the centre of his argument in a provocative new paper, \"Is US Economic Growth Over?\", is the insight that the latest wave of hi-tech innovation sweeping out from the US west coast may be less of a boon than its cheerleaders hope.</p> <p>As Silicon Valley twentysomethings waltz off with mega-billions, it's tempting to conclude that the internet has wrought the most radical transformation of the economy in modern history; and as Apple's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/25/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-trial?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">big-bucks patent case</a> against Samsung made clear, the corporate profits to be made and lost in what used to be called the \"new economy\" are immense.</p> <p>But Gordon warns that the growth dividend from the latest wave of innovations has actually been far smaller than that from what he calls the second industrial revolution, in the 19th century. In fact, he believes that the seemingly relentless expansion of the American economy could be about to run into the sand. Industrial revolution one, from about 1750 to 1830, brought steam and railways, Gordon argues; number two, from 1870 to 1900, gave us flushing toilets, electric light, the internal combustion engine and the telegraph, among a host of other benefits; and number three, from the 1970s onwards, computers.</p> <p>Gordon does not deny that there have been productivity gains from computers \u2013 serried ranks of secretaries in typing pools and filing cabinets full of punch-cards have been rendered obsolete; we can organise our lives with a barrage of text messages in the time it once took to pen a single note.</p> <p>And he acknowledges that productivity growth did improve, to 2.5% a year between 1996 and 2004, from 1.4% in the previous 15&#xa0;years, as the benefits spread through companies and homes \u2013 but he argues that many of these were one-off changes, which cannot now be repeated. Instead of speeding up production lines and freeing workers for less menial tasks than typing or filing, he argues, today's major inventions are focused instead on ever more elaborate consumer gadgets. \"Attention in the past decade has focused not on labour-saving innovation, but rather on a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before, but now in smaller and more convenient packages.\"</p> <p>He asks his readers to carry out a thought experiment: would they rather keep 2002 electronic technology, but lose anything invented in the past decade; or keep the full package of post-2002 innovations, including Twitter, their MP3 player and their iPad \u2013 but give up running water and indoor toilets, just two of the key inventions that transformed the world in the late 19th century.</p> <p>In case you're wavering, he makes it clear that: \"You have to haul the water into your dwelling and carry out the waste. Even at 3am on a rainy night, your only toilet option is a wet and perhaps muddy walk to the outhouse.\" Surely, he insists, even the most hardened Twitter addict would choose a flushing loo over their smartphone.</p> <p>Not only has much of the gain from gadgetry already been banked, Gordon claims, but even if the productivity improvements that took place from 1987 to 2007 were maintained, the US economy will be hampered in the coming decades by powerful headwinds. These include the heavy weight of consumer debt accumulated in the runup to 2007, and the reversal of the demographic dividend that came as the postwar baby-boomer generation grew up, joined the workforce, and paid their taxes.</p> <p>Gordon estimates that once all these challenges are taken into account, GDP growth per capita could slow to just 0.2% a year. That's still economic progress, of a sort \u2013 but it does mean, as Gordon argues, that the 21st century, unlike the 20th, will not be an \"American century\"; and today's young Americans must confront a very different future to that of their parents.</p> <p>They will have to think harder about rationing scarce resources, and perhaps take a humbler stance in relation to their foreign rivals \u2013 something we Brits have become increasingly used to since our own dominance of the global economy gave way to US hegemony.</p> <p>Gordon cheekily points out that per capita growth of 0.2% a year is the same rate economists believe Britain achieved on average in the 600 years or so before the first industrial revolution, which are better remembered for feudalism, illiteracy and back-breaking toil than the onward march of economic progress. But as the star-spangled banner flutters behind a thousand presidential stump speeches between now and November, don't expect to hear too much about that.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday, MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames will lead a parliamentary debate, prompted by an e-petition sponsored by the pressure group <a href=\"http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/\" title=\"\">Migration Watch</a>. It expresses deep concern that, despite very strong public opposition to \"mass immigration\", the population of the UK is expected to reach 70 million within 20 years, two-thirds of the increase due to migration. Undoubtedly, Thursday's \"No to 70 million\" debate will be marked by some clarity but also a great deal of confusion, contradiction and the employment of similar sets of statistics robustly interpreted to serve opposing sides of the argument.</p> <p>Immigration is an issue steeped in prejudice, traditionally too easily exploited by groups on both the right and left. At times, the toxic results have had a horrible impact on the lives of those who, over the decades, have otherwise successfully made the UK their home.</p> <p>A discussion is much needed on the many issues that arise from immigration. Its economic and cultural impact; its effect on the rationing of resources such as health and housing; and its impact on population, in particular on the level at which we feel the UK is deemed \"overcrowded\", given its requirement for a youthful influx to provide for an ageing society.</p> <p>However, that discussion is again and again sabotaged because immigration provides politicians with levers that are at times too carelessly pulled, particularly in the pre-party conference season. The result is often highly negative. The events at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/london-metropolitan-universities-educate-police?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> over the past few days are a case in point.</p> <p>The university's right to take students from outside the EU has been revoked. In spite of a warning six months ago that its procedures had to be improved \u2013 for instance, on students' attendance, and on policing the requirement to speak adequate English \u2013 the UK Border Agency says a recent inspection showed continuing and systematic failures. Now, almost 3,000 students face deportation if they cannot find fresh support to continue their studies. Nigerian Francis Owobiyi is among them, well advanced in his dissertation for a masters degree in international law. \"I could have gone to the US, to Canada, but I chose London, I regret that now,\" he said on Thursday.</p> <p>Malcolm Gillies, LMU vice-chancellor, does not impress with his assertions that change was underway. However, this cruel detonation of the academic lives of hundreds of legitimate, hard-working students is quite unjustified. Higher education is one of Britain's largest and most rapidly growing sources of international revenue. In 2011-12, foreign students accounted for \u00a32.7bn of universities' \u00a323bn income. Now we have a large \"Not Welcome\" sign nailed to the UK's front door.</p> <p>In July, in a House of Lords debate, the Border Agency was lambasted for its many failings. The peers listed its \"disgraceful\" short-term holding facilities for children at Heathrow and the detention for years of migrants, including torture victims. However, in the case of London Metropolitan, it's not the Border Agency that is primarily to blame. The fault lies with the government.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics announced that migration had fallen last year by almost 36,000 to 216,000, as the government tightened rules. However, margins of error mean very little change may have happened. This is in spite of the 2010 Conservative manifesto that promised to cut net migration from \"hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands\" by 2015.</p> <p>The challenge is that Britain's doors are legitimately open to 270m working-age citizens from the EU. In 2011, 589,000 people arrived in Britain. At the same time, fewer British were leaving to live abroad. So, the effort to reduce the numbers of workers from outside the EU, migrants claiming a place for family reasons and foreign students has become all the more urgent. But restrictions come at a price.</p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research says cutting foreign students by 50,000 annually could cost the economy \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn a year. Combine the loss from a reduction in foreign students with the cap on highly skilled workers, much needed by British business and industry, and, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the amount lost to the economy could reach \u00a34bn a year. However, there are other than purely economic calculations that need to be made.</p> <p>In July, Ed Miliband, the son of a refugee, apologised on behalf of his party for allowing net immigration to reach 3.2m under Labour without sufficiently addressing people's concerns about its impact on housing, schools, jobs and benefit entitlements and the pace of change in some communities. A person does not turn into a bigot for raising such matters, he affirmed. So, as a sense of cultural identity, shared values and a common notion of citizenship must also play a significant part in the equation, how is immigration best controlled and what size of population can Britain carry and prosper?</p> <p>Any reasonable response requires that we understand better the benefits and true costs of immigration and that means more credible research. A lack of trust in the government's effectiveness in controlling immigration and manning its borders also needs addressing. A decision on population growth \u2013 70m, 80m, 100m? \u2013 demands that priorities are agreed. As Oxford University's excellent Migration Observatory argues, a population policy designed to benefit the environment, for example, may be very different from one maximising economic growth.</p> <p>Sweden has opened its doors wide to immigrants but worked with trade unions to ensure that paying a pittance for an hour's labour is severely restrained: fairness is key. Fairness is needed here, too, for instance in the allocation of social housing, but also in helping integration by restoring access to free English courses, ravaged by cuts.</p> <p>At the very least, too, the government needs to exempt non-EU students from the visa cap and desist from ramping up the rhetoric. Immigration is a complex and ultimately visceral issue. Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the Olympics, Sunder Katwala from the think tank British Future reminded us that many of Britain's medal winners were third-generation immigrants.</p> <p>\"Beneath the sound and the fury is a lot of consensus on immigration policy,\" he says. \"We are better at integration than we think.\"</p> <p>We should remember those words when we resume our frequently anxious debate about immigration.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012. The original referred to the think tank Future Britain rather than British Future. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>It has long been conventional wisdom in Washington political circles that Condoleezza Rice did not desire a future in high political office. After being President George W Bush's national security adviser and then his secretary of state she would simply bask in the afterglow of a career at the heart of global geopolitics.</p> <p>Rice had been so personally loyal to the Bush clan, it was believed that she would leave the stage along with them. She would be happy indulging her twin passions of academia and sports as a faculty member of prestigious Stanford University and, just recently, one of the first women to break into the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/augusta-national-gains-stature-by-admitting-condoleezza-rice-darla-moore/2012/08/20/3f2f97ca-eb01-11e1-b811-09036bcb182b_story.html\" title=\"\">Augusta National Golf Club</a>.</p> <p>So, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/condoleezza-rice-paul-ryan-republican-convention\" title=\"\">Rice </a>took to the stage at the Republican convention in Tampa, not much in the way of excitement was expected. But when she stepped down 20 or so minutes later, it was into a political world upturned. Not only had the usually calmly spoken, wonkish Rice given an emotional, barn-burning speech of the sort that had thousands of conventioneers cheering in the aisles but it had also hinted in no uncertain terms at the White House.</p> <p>She teed it up like a seasoned campaigner. \"On a personal note,\" she began teasingly after endorsing Mitt Romney to run against President Barack Obama. Then she dipped into her own biography in a way that sounded suspiciously like a stump speech. \"A little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham \u2013 the most segregated big city in America. Her parents can't take her to a movie theatre or a restaurant, but they make her believe that even though she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworths lunch counter, she can be president of the United States,\" Rice said.</p> <p>She has used similar lines before. But, as Rice knows full well, in American politics context is everything and there is no mistaking the context of a national Republican convention. Suddenly, Rice was back at the heart of the action and her ambitions were the hot topic of gossip at Tampa. An intense bout of speculation earlier this year that Romney might pick her as a running mate had been dismissed by most as posturing to show the former Massachusetts governor had a woman on his shortlist.</p> <p>Now it looked like it had been real. If Romney loses in 2012, will we see Rice run in 2016? Or, as she has never run for elected office before, maybe she will start smaller and test out the waters first \u2013 as a California senator, perhaps? \u2013 and then run in 2020. With a few well-picked words and a gift for stirring oratory that many were unaware of, Rice had opened up a stunning new world of possibility: that America's next black president might be a woman and a Republican. That is the thing about the assumptions of conventional wisdom: they can be so easily turned on their head by actual events.</p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, 57, was not exaggerating one jot in the description of the disadvantages of her childhood. Born on 14 November 1954, Rice's childhood was spent in the segregated Deep South where the racial lines were stark and patrolled by the threat of violence. It was something her family knew all about. Rice's father, John Wesley Rice, was a minister but that did not stop him from arming himself with a shotgun, along with other black men in the neighbourhood, when racist whites threatened to attack in the early 1960s (Rice cites the moment as being behind a firm belief in gun rights).</p> <p>In the troubled times of the 1950s and 1960s, few places were worse than Birmingham as America's blacks struggled their way through the civil rights movement. In 1963, a horrific <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAC16.htm\" title=\"\">church bombing</a> in the city (nicknamed grimly \"Bombingham\") shocked the nation as it killed four young black girls, including 11-year-old Denise McNair, one of Rice's childhood friends.</p> <p>\"I know a little bit of what it's like to have somebody try to terrorise a community. These little girls weren't going to hurt anybody. They didn't have any political power,\" she once told an interviewer. \"</p> <p>Yet Rice's childhood was not one defined by trauma. Far from it. Her family, including her high-school teacher mother, Angelena, was a close-knit unit; she was an only child and the focus of her parents' love and ambitions. The Rices also belonged to the small segment of black southern society in Birmingham that formed a solid middle class. Rice's prodigious childhood talents were nurtured. She was a talented pianist (and still plays almost to a professional level). Her unusual name comes from the Italian musical term \"con dolcezza\", meaning \"with sweetness\". She learned foreign languages from a young age, did ballet and figure-skating. In 1967, the family moved to Denver and Rice won a place at the University of Denver in 1971 to study political science.</p> <p>For many Democrats, that story would tick various liberal boxes, just as Barack Obama's biography as a mixed-race child raised by a single white mother from Kansas does. But Rice, as the talented child of a southern preacher who saw first hand the violence of racism, instead eventually drew conservative lessons from life. Her family taught a solid, middle-class work ethic of buckling down, working the system to the best of your ability and trusting America to get it right in the end. Which, in Rice's case at least, it did.</p> <p>Rice worked at her studies, got a masters from Notre Dame, worked briefly in the State Department of President Jimmy Carter and then got a Phd from the University of Denver. She specialised in the Soviet Union, developing hardline conservative foreign policy views, and was eventually hired at Stanford. It was there she first came to the attention of the political clan that would become her second family: the Bushes.</p> <p>Introduced by Bush family adviser Brent Scowcroft, Rice became a family confidante. She served President George HW Bush and then his son, working as George W Bush's foreign policy adviser during the 2000 campaign. After he won, he named her national security adviser and then, in his second term, she became secretary of state. The two were very close, bound by a love of football, prayer and each comfortable with their end of the president-adviser relationship. (She even once mistakenly referred to Bush as \"my husband\".) Of course, it helped that Rice keeps her personal life private. That has fuelled various rumours about her sexuality. She was briefly engaged to a football player in the late 1970s. She explains her solitary ways by simply being so immersed in work.</p> <p>But what one thinks of Rice depends on what one thinks of the Bush years. For many Democrats, and even more people abroad, that means a close association with a failure to spot 9/11 coming, the dreadful horrors of the invasion of Iraq and the neocon ascendancy of the 2000s. So, while Republicans feted and praised Rice after her speech in Tampa, not everyone was pleased to see her. A day before she took to the podium, a group of leftwing protesters tried to enter a Tampa arts centre where Rice was appearing with the intention of \"arresting\" her for war crimes.</p> <p>Yet, if Bush is still not exactly missed by many Republicans , it appears Rice has shed any doubts with the party base left over from her role in his administrations. Partly that may be to do with her race. Republican officials are acutely aware of the lily-white nature of much of their party and when it does try to \"diversify\" that usually means Hispanics. One recent survey showed support for Romney at 0% \u2013 yes, 0% \u2013 among black Americans.</p> <p>In Tampa, two convention-goers were ejected for throwing nuts at a black CNN journalist. Rice offers a high-profile antidote to all of that ugliness. She makes a point of never playing on her race. She is determined that she should be judged on her abilities. She told one interviewer who broached the subject: \"Let me explain to you: I speak French, I play Bach, I'm better in your culture than you are.\"</p> <p>There do not seem to be many obstacles to Rice within the Republican party. When the vice-presidential speculation was circulating, one public opinion poll put Rice as the favourite choice, ahead of eventual pick, <a href=\"http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/29/13557231-ryan-accepts-vp-nod-lets-get-this-done?lite\" title=\"\">Congressman Paul Ryan</a>. It is clear that if Rice wants to enter party politics and run for office then there is a receptive Republican audience waiting for her. It will be up to her to make a decision. If she stays out of the spotlight, her academic career and the lucrative lecture circuit will always await. Her Tampa speech will be remembered as a one-off, full-throated roar of what might have been.</p> <p>But if she takes a risk, if she really does go for it, last week will mark the beginning of something entirely new and unexpected.</p> <p>* This article was amended on 6 September 2012 to make it clear that the experience of watching her father defend their neighbourhood against white supremacists made Condoleezza Rice a firm believer in gun rights. The piece originally said that these experiences made her a believer in gun control.</p>",
  "<p>As befits the most venerable event on the movie calendar, the Venice film festival requires constant maintenance to keep it afloat. The walk to the Palazzo del Cinema leads along a tranquil green canal and past faded mansions before depositing us in the midst of a building site, ringing to the din of drills and hammers and the incessant beep of reversing lorries. Inside the screening rooms it is hushed and reverent. Outside it's bedlam; an ongoing work in progress.</p> <p>Alberto Barbera, Venice's new artistic director, likens the festival to \"an old lady in need of freshening up\" and is promising a major makeover: less glitz, more substance and a greater emphasis on emerging talent. And yet even Barbera is not quite the new broom he first appears. He directed this event for three years in the late 90s before being ousted when Silvio Berlusconi came to power, and now he bounces back like some avenging angel. In Venice \u2013 that lush, dripping museum in the guise of a city \u2013 the past is forever on hand to gatecrash the present.</p> <p>The 69th edition kicked off on Wednesday night with the world premiere of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2012/aug/30/venice-film-festival-reluctant-fundamentalist-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"><strong>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</strong></a>, directed by Mira Nair from the Mohsin Hamid bestseller. The film itself is a 21st-century riff on the Horatio Alger story, and stars the British actor Riz Ahmed as Changez, a Pakistani immigrant who strikes gold on Wall Street. Changez loves America but he hates it too \u2013 startling himself by smirking at the TV screen when the planes hit the World Trade Centre. He's not so much reluctant as befuddled and conflicted, torn between Lahore and New York City.</p> <p>If Barbera intended to open the festival with a bang, I'm not sure <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em> quite delivered. What should have been a portrait of violent cultural ambivalence becomes, instead, a study in nervous equivocation. Nair's film flirts with danger but shies away. It handles the plot's unstable nitroglycerin with lengthy tongs and peppers its turbulent, globalised terrain with so many helpful narrative signposts that we are never able to veer into the rough, let alone meet the beasts that live there. The whole thing is too damn well-mannered for its own good.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IFST0KW0pc&amp;list=UUjyBmRFhkJtnsWc261LMxBw&amp;index=2&amp;feature=plcp\" title=\"\"><strong>Betrayal</strong></a>, if anything, runs too far in the other direction. Kirill Serebrennikov's tale of middle-class adultery and the carnage that follows is purely (and often brilliantly) brutal. The script thrums with incoming violence, painting inner-city Moscow as a hell of howling traffic and jangling shopping carts. In the meantime the heroine (Franziska Petri) is coming apart at the seams. She eats mouthfuls of dirt. She licks at the beard trimmings she finds in the sink. At one stage she breaks into peals of hysterical laughter, checks herself, and then faints dead away on a motorway overpass. Staggering away from the screening, I knew exactly how she felt.</p> <p>There's not much warmth in <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/out-of-competition/iceman.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The Iceman</strong></a> either, which casts Michael Shannon as real-life mafia hitman Richard Kuklinski, trundling through 70s New Jersey with murder on his mind. Ariel Vroman's film is dogged, efficient and overfamiliar \u2013 a retro arrangement of sideburns, glitterballs and roller-rinks. But Shannon's menacing, monolithic presence is mesmerising.</p> <p>By the end of day one, the festival has found its rhythm, and the screenings start blooming all over the site. They're playing in the hangar-like expanse of the Sala Darsena and in the theatres inside the brutalist marble&#xa0;casino next door. To queue for one is to miss the others and to miss the others means potentially missing the best.</p> <p>Taking a gamble, I skip Ulrich Seidl's <em>Paradise: Faith</em> in favour of Ramin Bahrani's <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/venezia69/at-any-price.htm\" title=\"\"><strong>At Any Price</strong></a> \u2013 but alarm bells are ringing barely 10 minutes in. The film is a cut-price <em>East of Eden</em>, as flat and featureless as the Iowa plains. Not even the sight of Zac Efron toiling to shrug off his <em>High School Musical</em> image by shooting out shop windows and having sex with Heather Graham inside a grain silo can provide a distraction. The script feels synthetic, genetically modified, and the corn is as high as an elephant's eye.</p> <p>As the weekend blows in, the delegates gather for the morning screening of <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/out-of-competition/bad.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Bad 25</strong></a>, Spike Lee's boisterous if uncritical tour of Michael Jackson's 1987 album. They come out humming Smooth Criminal and The Way You Make Me Feel, and an elderly Italian gent affects an apologetic moonwalk on the walkway outside the Palazzo. All at once their spirits have lifted. While the jury is still out on the success of Barbera's leaner, tauter festival, a mood of optimism dominates the site. The coming days bring Paul Thomas Anderson's <em>The Master</em>, Harmony Korine's <em>Spring Breakers</em> and Terrence Malick's <em>To the Wonder</em>. One has the distinct sense that the future of Venice 69 will be a few shades brighter than its past.</p>",
  "<p>Only recently, the future of the Transformers gaming franchise looked bleak. Having incurred the wrath of fans and critics alike with last year's disappointing movie tie-in, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/03/transformers-3-dark-moon-review\" title=\"\"><em>Dark of the Moon</em></a>, developer High Moon was under pressure to deliver a return to form. Its response was to look back to the 80s for inspiration, and the result is both a love-letter to Transformers lore and a much-improved action game.</p> <p>Transformers nerds will no doubt delight in the many nods and winks to Marvel comics and cartoons, but it's the frenetic pace and large-scale battles that impress the most. Building on the blueprint set out in 2010's <em>War for Cybertron</em>, this latest instalment is a brash, bombastic concoction of third-person shooting, vehicle combat and melee action that moves along with relentless speed.</p> <p>The story campaign, while short, is littered with huge setpieces and is at its best when providing the player with large, open battlefields in which to experiment. In these sections, the seamless transition between slick, responsive gun-play and fast-paced vehicular action offers a refreshing degree of freedom. With solid multiplayer and co-op modes in tow, <em>Fall of Cybertron</em> is the perfect example of how a developer can reassert control over a faltering franchise.</p>",
  "<p>Clean-shaven, dressed in jeans and&#xa0;a&#xa0;light blue shirt, Domhnall Gleeson is almost unrecognisable as the actor who plays Konstantin Levin, a solemn young landowner with a coppery beard, in <em>Anna Karenina</em>. It's&#xa0;his biggest screen role to date, one that comes in the wake of accomplished turns in the IRA thriller <em>Shadow Dancer</em> and the new Judge Dredd film.</p> <p>\"They sent me the script for <em>Anna Karenina</em> and I thought, 'Oh, this is way out of my league in terms of the type of actor who would normally play this part',\" he says. But he held his own during a five-hour audition in Los Angeles. Afterwards, when Wright called to say he had got the part, \"I did a little dance on the street in Soho. It was wonderful.\"</p> <p>Gleeson's career has been gaining momentum for some time. Born in Dublin in 1983, he is the eldest son of actor Brendan Gleeson, but following in his father's footsteps initially didn't appeal to him, until he read the script for Martin McDonagh's play <em>The Lieutenant of Inishmore</em> while studying film-making at Dublin Institute of Technology.</p> <p>\"It was just the funniest thing I'd ever read, and I auditioned for it and got it. On stage the reception for Martin's stuff was fantastic. I thought, 'If I could do this for as long as I live \u2026 why not just take a chance and see how it goes?'\"</p> <p>That performance in 2006 won him a Tony. Four years later he distinguished himself with scene-stealing appearances in the last two Harry Potter films, Mark Romanek's <em>Never Let Me Go</em> and the Coen brothers' <em>True Grit</em>, as well as playing a young Bob Geldof in the BBC2 drama <em>When Harvey Met&#xa0;Bob</em>.</p> <p>In <em>Anna Karenina</em>, Gleeson portrays Levin's struggle to define what he wants out of life. Close to his heart is Kitty, played by Swedish actress Alicia Vikander. \"I knew Alicia a tiny little bit, as we were both named Shooting Stars at the Berlin film festival, so that was cool. She's got a fast-track to honesty when she performs, when she acts, and I felt very comfortable with her on set. We worked very hard to create a truthful relationship, and whenever we got to the place where we needed to be in love, I felt like I was totally in love.\"</p> <p>Their narrative weaves into the main storyline. \"Anna, her husband, and Vronsky's love triangle is so interesting and sexual and lovely, it could easily be its own film, but I think having Levin in the mix is a really good move. Tom Stoppard did a fantastic job of working him into the script, providing counterpoint to where Anna exists.\"</p> <p>Next up, Gleeson is playing the lead in the new Richard Curtis film, <em>About Time</em>, alongside Rachel McAdams. \"I was ready to do something where there was more opportunity to look for the laughs. Who better to do that with than Richard Curtis? Seeing him rework a gag on the floor has been brilliant.\"</p> <p>But for now he is awaiting the reaction when<em> Anna Karenina</em> is released in cinemas. \"I saw the film&#xa0;after we finished shooting in February and all I could think of was how proud I was to be involved.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Sarah Greenwood, production designer</h2> <p>It may have been an ingenious creative and financial solution, but Joe Wright's big idea on <em>Anna Karenina</em> \u2013 to stage most of the film inside a Russian theatre \u2013 posed a herculean challenge for his long-time production designer. Rather than shooting the film on location in Russia and England as planned, \"We had to reconceive the whole thing and build this theatre from scratch in Shepperton with just 12 weeks to go till shooting and no extra budget.\"</p> <p>Luckily, this was not Sarah Greenwood's first collaboration with Wright. She had worked with him right at the start of his career, on his 2000 TV debut <em>Nature Boy</em>, and on his subsequent feature films (receiving Oscar nominations for her work on <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em> and <em>Atonement</em>), so she trusted his judgment and he trusted that she could pull it off.</p> <p>\"Framing it in this derelict theatre was a fantastic concept, given the theatricality of high society in St Petersburg and Moscow at the time,\" she says. It also allowed them to move between scenes \u2013 from restaurants to ice-rinks to racecourses \u2013 with dizzying fluidity: rarely has a production designer's work been so foregrounded in a film.</p> <p>Only Levin's story brought them outside the theatrical frame and into the \"real\" world, which meant shooting some wintry scenes on location in Russia. The famous scything scenes were filmed on Salisbury Plain, \"the closest we could get to massive open Russian plains here in the UK \u2013 Salisbury hasn't really been touched in 200 years because of the army base\".</p> <p>Was all the mayhem and hard graft worthwhile for Greenwood? \"With hindsight, it would've been dull had we just done a period drama,\" she says. \"This was much more exciting.\"</p> <h2>Jacqueline Durran, costume designer<br></h2> <p>Like many of the crew members on <em>Anna Karenina</em>, Jacqueline Durran has worked with Joe Wright several times in the past and with considerable success \u2013 she was Oscar-nominated for her costume design on <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and <em>Atonement</em>. The closeness of Wright's team is liberating, she says, because people aren't afraid to speak their minds; it also helps that Wright is more fashion-conscious than most directors. \"His interest in costume comes from puppets \u2013 his parents had the Puppet Theatre at the Angel Theatre \u2013 so he has always been aware of the possibilities of costumes and how costumes move.\"</p> <p>For <em>Anna Karenina</em>, Wright wanted Durran to concentrate on silhouette rather than surface detail. \"He didn't want to end up with naturalistic 1870s costumes or to get constricted by the period. As the Russian aristocrats were obsessed with French culture in the 19th century, we came up with the idea of tweaking it a bit and using the heyday of couture from the 1950s to emphasise Anna's modern streak. That really helped Keira understand Anna.\"</p> <p>Historians and costume purists may quibble with the odd anachronism or cultural mash-up, but Durran is unapologetic: the film's theatrical framework meant that historical accuracy was low on their list of priorities. In the case of Levin and his peasants: \"We might have muddled up the regions, north and south,\" she says cheerfully. \"No money was spent on a Russian expert.\"</p> <p>Instead, she threw her energies into realising Wright's ultra-specific vision. \"Vronsky's uniform had to be absolutely white \u2013 but hardly any wool is made white; it's made cream or grey. That proved to be an absolute nightmare. But we got there in the end.\"</p> <h2>Seamus McGarvey, cinematographer<br></h2> <p>When Seamus McGarvey photographed <em>Atonement</em> for Joe Wright in 2006, they devised a moment at the centre of the film that became one of its major talking points: an extraordinary five-minute tracking shot through a military camp on the beach at Dunkirk that captures in sweeps and pirouettes the surreal horrors of war. There may be no single moment in <em>Anna Karenina</em> that compares to that shot for virtuosity; rather, the whole film is a virtuoso act by the acclaimed Northern Irish cinematographer, whose recent credits include <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> and <em>Avengers Assemble</em>.</p> <p>McGarvey joined the film just before shooting began and had little time to get to grips with its unorthodox theatre setting and the fact that certain scenes were designed to change right before our eyes, without the camera cutting away, like a stage set being rearranged in the middle of a performance.</p> <p>\"One sequence goes from Oblonsky's office at closing time and takes you through the streets of St Petersburg, where you see Levin looking for a restaurant, and suddenly the camera swirls around into the restaurant and the scene begins \u2013 all in one shot, without leaving the room.\"</p> <p>It's rare that a cinematographer on a big digital-age production is asked to create effects in-camera rather than relying on computers to fill in the blanks in post-production, but on this movie McGarvey used mirrors, Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s-style, to realise Anna's premonitions, and filmed with a stocking over the lens to imbue certain scenes with a particular glow.</p> <p>\"I relished it,\" he says. \"Working with Joe, you're always presented with difficult challenges; he really pushes every department to do their very best. He won't settle for average. The best work I've done has been on Joe's films as a result.\"</p>",
  "<p>The mark of a decent pop biopic is that it should make its subject intriguing even if the viewer has little or no knowledge of (or, indeed, interest in) the music. Something of an icon in France, cheesy, smooth chanteur <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Fran%C3%A7ois\" title=\"\">Claude Fran\u00e7ois</a> is viewed as little more than a pop footnote in the UK, the answer to that always taxing pub quiz question: \"Who had a European hit with the French-language song that later formed the basis of the English-language standard My Way?\" His death at the age of 39 in a <em>Spinal Tap</em>-style freak bathroom accident in 1978 provoked outpourings of public grief and adulation in Fran\u00e7ois's home country reminiscent of those that attended Elvis's premature death in America the previous year.</p> <p>Now, with the brashly colourful <strong>Cloclo </strong>(2012, StudioCanal, 12), director Florent-Emilio Siri attempts to portray the man behind the mask, albeit with the broadest of strokes, despite an earnestly over-extended running time (nearly two-and-a-half hours) that may stretch the patience of even diehard fans.</p> <p>Skipping nimbly through all the traditional biopic milestones (conflicted childhood, unappreciative father, early faltering showbiz steps leading to sudden success and equally sudden disillusionment), <em>Cloclo</em> owes a debt to Kevin Spacey's underrated love song to Bobby Darin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/97102/beyond.the.sea\" title=\"\"><em>Beyond the Sea</em></a>, in both tone and delivery. At the heart of its appeal is a wonderfully mercurial performance by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, unrecognisable from previous roles in films such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/15/dardenne-brothers-dont-argue-actors\" title=\"\">Dardenne brothers</a>' gems <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/10/1\" title=\"\"><em>The Child</em></a> and <em>The Kid With a Bike</em>. Capturing both the charm and the creepiness of Fran\u00e7ois, Renier makes the part his own \u2013 strutting like a peacock, popping like a cork and huffing in the manner of one for whom fame has become <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMoY5rNBjwk\" title=\"\"><em>comme d'habitude</em>.</a></p> <p>Billed as a lovable romantic comedy set against a charmingly offbeat angling backdrop, <strong>Salmon Fishing in the</strong> <strong>Yemen </strong>(2011, Lionsgate, 12) does a pretty good job of filleting the satirical sociopolitical guts from Paul Torday's source novel. While the book was essentially a satire on media spin with nods toward the philosophical aspirations of <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's more lightweight and upbeat film (from a script by <em>The</em> <em>Full Monty</em> writer Simon Beaufoy) resets its&#xa0;sights on a pair of star-crossed lovers attempting to dream the impossible dream.</p> <p>Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt are very likable as the mismatched fisheries expert and millionaire's aide who become emotionally entangled while attempting to make salmon run in an environment not known for its enviable fishing conditions. Despite Kristin Scott Thomas's bristling presence, those in search of coarse sport may be disappointed, but as the cinematic equivalent of tasty tinned tuna it's palatably bone-free.</p> <p>It would be nice to report that Glenn Close's awards-courting turn as a woman passing for a man in <strong>Albert Nobbs </strong>(2011, Entertainment One, 15) was enough to carry this tale of a 19th-century Dublin butler with a lifelong secret. Having first parlayed the role on stage in the 80s, Close is comfortable in her character's clothes, as is her similarly cross-dressing support, Janet McTeer. The problem is the film itself, which is inert and, frankly, somewhat fusty. No matter how potentially fascinating the lives of its central characters may be, this never exudes much in the way of cinematic brio. The end result is altogether more admirable than enjoyable, a shame because there's an eye-opening film lurking in the background, unable to break through the dour period fug.</p> <p>In cinemas, <em>Piranha 3DD</em> reminded us that screen stereoscopy was, is and always will be a crass gimmick beloved of carnival hucksters and schlocksploitation hacks. On DVD, the two-dimensional <strong>Piranha DD </strong>(2012, EIV, 18) loses the one reason for its miserable existence \u2013 a rubbish titular pun \u2013 leaving foolhardy punters with nothing more than some lame gore, softcore T&amp;A and stunningly unfunny celebrity cameos from the likes of David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd and Gary Busey to see them through. Blu-ray viewers are treated to the reinstated \"3 double-dee\" gag, although anyone who wants to sit squinting at a TV just to see body parts coming out of the screen deserves a headache, frankly. For the record, all the best gags are ripped off from <em>Shivers</em>, <em>Teeth</em> and <em>The Stewardesses</em>.</p>",
  "<p>September is one of my favourite months and I'm hoping this year for the still, warm days of an Indian summer. The light is never more beautiful than it is now, sliding into the garden at an ever-increasing angle to tease out the detail. It feels like there is time on our hands to take it all in, the rush of growth slowed, the fear of losing control diminished. Rosy-faced apples weigh down branches and lazy wasps have the remains of the plum harvest. Sunflowers will never be taller, berries are hanging heavy on the once-blooming roses, and the butterflies, which have had a hard time of it this summer, are making the most of the asters and the last heat in the sun.</p> <p>Over years of garden-making I have come to see the benefit of playing to this season. Spring is automatically exciting and we are spoilt for choice in summer, but leaving room in the borders for this window has many benefits. It provides us with anticipation and the contrast of fresh life among the remains of what has come before. It is interesting to use shrubs as the building blocks around which the more ephemeral annuals and perennials can ebb and flow. You have to be sure when you commit to the long-term investment of a shrub, and I like the way this concentrates the mind.</p> <p>In open, sun-filled situations, few things work harder than Russian sage. <em>Perovskia atriplicifolia </em>hails from the arid lands of Central Asia, and if it doesn't sit wet, in heavy clay soil, it is hugely adaptable. It has a long season of flower, when pale spires rise up to colour violet-blue with the lavenders. Where lavender is ready to be cut back to its winter framework by the end of summer, <em>P atriplicifolia</em> will branch and re-branch with new spurs and spikes until well into autumn.</p> <p>\"Blue Spire\" is the typical form on offer, and where I have room I will leave it to loll about under its own weight as the spikes topple across paths and neighbours; but for the neater minded, \"Little Spire\" is a better option. It will keep the vertical better and will grow to 3ft at most. Russian sage is a beloved plant of bees and butterflies, which easily access the nectar, and the violet-blue makes a good companion to the hot pink of late-flowering <em>Nerine bowdenii</em> or autumn-flowering colchicum.</p> <p>Buddleia also bridge the high-summer gap and move gracefully into autumn. Secondary spikes of flower, which are smaller than the first, provide the impact now. Some might argue that buddleia have a&#xa0;railway-siding mood once they go to seed and that by now they are bringing the tone of the garden down rather than providing the focus.</p> <p>The darker-flowered varieties tend to be lighter on their feet once the first flowers are over, and I favour the smaller-flowered forms for the same reason. Velvety \"Black Knight\", fine-leaved \"Nanho Blue\" and silvery leaved \"Lochinch\" are all good. I&#xa0;will team them up with <em>Caryopteris </em>x<em> clandonensis</em>, which like the same pruning regime. C \"Arthur Simmonds\" is a good dark blue, forming a&#xa0;deciduous 3ft shrub. Like buddleia, they are tough and adaptable.</p> <p>I found <em>Vitex agnus-castus </em>in hot black sand dunes in Greece this year, and having seen it in context I&#xa0;can see why it favours a warm position if it is to flower well. The fingered foliage could be confused for hemp or cannabis, but the flowers emerge as tapering spikes at the tips of the extension growth. The true form is silvery blue, but, if you can find it, \"Silver Spire\" is a shimmering white selection with light limbs.</p> <p>I plant it with <em>Ceratostigma willmottianum </em>at its feet, as they both love the same conditions. <em>Ceratostigma</em>, known as the hardy plumbago, is a small wiry shrub which performs late. Indigo and violet flowers stud growth that colours vividly crimson as autumn advances. The flowers will outlast the nerine, the acers and the latest of the asters until they are finally silenced by frost.</p> <h2>Get growing<br></h2> <p>Make a note of where the last rays of sun penetrate the garden, and place the late-flowering plants there for the best of the butterflies and sun-loving honey bees</p>",
  "<p>There's a scene in the latest Sarah Polley film, <em>Take This Waltz</em>, where Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman shower with their ageing water aerobics class in a gangly soup of bellies and pubes and shampoo. It is not like most female nude scenes \u2013 it's brightly lit, it shows a variety of body shapes, and its purpose is not to titillate. \"I'm standing like a caveman,\" said Silverman of the scene. \"It's very DEAD\u2026 I'm a human body.\" Polley explains: \"Every time you see a&#xa0;naked woman's body on screen, it's either in a sexual context \u2014 or if it's an older woman it's the scene in <em>About Schmidt</em>, where Kathy Bates gets into the hot tub and the whole audience is supposed to scream, and Jack Nicholson is so horrified. I've seen that over and over,\" she says, \"and I&#xa0;find that really offensive that women's bodies are either objectified or used for comic value.\" And yet.</p> <p>And yet this scene is discussed in every review, in every interview. The scene had been up and downloaded online weeks before the film even opened in the UK and, as with Lena Dunham's nudity in HBO's <em>Girls</em> (which comes to British telly later this year), critics have flocked around this unusual image of a naked woman with un-surgeried breasts and a&#xa0;convex stomach, hanging their entire conversation on the wobble of a thigh. Where a traditionally attractive woman's body would have been dismissed, plot-wise, as background music, a saggier breast must stand for something. It must be discussed with studied detachment.</p> <p><em>The New Yorker</em> saw the shower scene's display of \"pudgy corpulence\" as an arrow towards the film's underlying theme \u2013 that \"though everyone is beautiful, some are more beautiful than others\", while the <em>New York Times</em> said this single scene of nudity shows that, \"young flesh will age; old flesh was once young; time wins in the end\". Never is it not mentioned. Which is fine \u2013 it makes sense, these are scenes and bodies we rarely see, but in discussing them it exposes our squinting dismay. I wonder what the bodies in next year's Chlo\u00eb Moretz remake of <em>Carrie</em> will be like \u2013 the original having such focus on body-horror, the original having the most naked shower scene ever. Will the new bodies be hairy, pasty, pendulous? Or will that distract from the plot?</p> <p>It's odd, I think, that in order for nudity to be read as casual, as relaxed, real, the bodies must be anything but \u2013 the bodies must be tanned and toned enough to tell no stories at all. If they have bellies, the bellies must stand for something \u2013 Dunham was regularly described by critics as \"brave\", her body \"shocking\". Silverman warned fans to lower their expectations before watching her nude scene, pre-empting the inevitable analysis. Even when the nudity is meant to be casual, the response is complicated.</p> <p>However hard female directors like Dunham and Polley work to diversify bodies on screen, throwing their actors and selves to the audiences like live bait, we're not there yet \u2013 we're not yet at a place where female nudity is read as anything but either sexy or transgressive.

  "<p>The sari, aka \"the six-yard wonder\", should be a sustainable garment without peer. Whether the wearer expands or shrinks, it's easily adapted; you control how the folds of fabric are arranged. In theory it can be worn forever, moving through life with you \u2013 the antithesis of fast fashion.</p> <p>The best traditional Banarasi silk saris were hand loomed by highly skilled artisans in the Indian holy city of Varanasi. Then \u2013 affecting almost every other part of the textile supply chain \u2013 along came China. By 2010 India was importing 6.4bn rupees worth of Chinese silk fabrics, all but destroying the homegrown industry.</p> <p>Not that we should get all rose-tinted about homegrown production. In 2003 Human Rights Watch found 72 silk units in one area of Varanasi and just one poor-quality school \u2013 the children were mainly working in sari units. Although the ILO (International Labour Organisation) acknowledges that there has been progress, as the 2016 deadline for the worldwide eradication of child labour looms the pace of progress is slowing.</p> <p>When you buy a sari, ask questions about the importer supply chain. The onus is on them to provide certification from the production facilities, including the beading workshops. What is the minimum age&#xa0;of workers? (It should be 18.) What is the minimum wage (preferably a&#xa0;\"living wage\")? Are there stipulated working hours and paid overtime? These are fundamentals.</p> <p>Also, prioritise heritage skill programmes that reward craftsmen. I have failed to find fairtrade UK retailers, but there are schemes supporting artisans who produce authentic saris. Look for co-operatives such as Artisan Hut in Bangladesh; <a href=\"http://craftrevival.org\" title=\"\">craftrevival.org</a>, a&#xa0;campaigning organisation in India, is a useful source, and <a href=\"http://rkderawala.com\" title=\"\">rkderawala.com</a>, with its vegetable-dyed saris from Bagru, keeps skilled producers in the game.</p> <p>Above all, go for hand loomed, says founder of UK clothing brand People Tree Safia Minney, who has worked with Artisan Hut and used about 4,000 skilled producers in People Tree's lines. The mechanisation of textile production has been a disaster for rural producers, so look for saris made using traditional methods that don't need electricity. Hand weaving uses nine times more labour than material produced on a power loom. There's no need to dress up the positive impact of keeping artisanal weavers employed.</p> <h2>Green crush<br></h2> <p>Our current definition of farming is too narrow.

  "<p>\"Do they have skyscrapers?\" a London acquaintance innocently asks Tom Feiling, recently returned from Colombia. <em>Short Walks from Bogot\u00e1</em> sets out to unravel Colombia's complexities for those who have little conception of the country beyond cocaine, violence and the execution of footballer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Escobar\" title=\"\">Andr\u00e9s Escobar</a> by drug barons following his own goal in the 1994 World Cup. In 2010, Feiling \u2013 a documentary maker who has worked for a human rights organisation in Colombia and written a well-received book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/society/9780141034461/the-candy-machine-how-cocaine-took-over-the-world\" title=\"\"><em>The</em> <em>Candy Machine</em></a>, on its cocaine trade \u2013 returned to Bogot\u00e1, drawn by a <em>Newsweek </em>portrait of a country on the rise after years of civil war. \"This country has moved from terrorism to tourism,\" the strong-arm then president \u00c1lvaro Uribe had announced, and Feiling reasoned the expected flood of visitors would need a primer.</p> <p>Starting in the potholed capital Bogot\u00e1, he sets off on a series of excursions to areas beginning to open up after years of conflict. Along the way, he takes in the incredible variety of Colombia's geography, from lush tropical valleys to mountain ranges, coastal swamps and deep jungle. He also charts the sharp divisions among its 46 million people \u2013 the white-skinned 10% who control 80% of the country's wealth, the mixed-race 40% \"who spend their lives working as hard as they can\", and the darkest-skinned half of the population, who live in poverty in isolated rural regions or the slums that ring large cities. \"We have first, second and third worlds living side by side,\" a Colombian friend tells Feiling.</p> <p>As would-be builders of the Colombian state found in the 19th century, making sense of this diversity is no easy task. Looking back to the birth of the nation, Feiling highlights Britain's key role in the then Spanish colony's battle for independence in the early 1800s. The South American rebels appealing for military support in&#xa0;London were at first so impoverished they had to clothe volunteers in uniforms cast off by soldiers returning from the Napoleonic war \u2013 but as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar\" title=\"\">Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar</a>'s struggle became a cause celebre, their new troops were soon dressed in \"strikingly luxurious uniforms based on those of the Royal Artillery\".</p> <p><em>Short Walks from Bogot\u00e1</em> is inevitably dominated by more recent history: the almost 50-year-old conflict between the Farc and the Colombian state, inflamed by both rightwing paramilitary groups that sprang up in the 1990s, and the billions of dollars of US aid secured by the government to \"fight narco-terrorism\". Excellent chapters trace the murky dealings between the conflict's main players and follow ex-Farc guerrillas to a town in the hot, swampy Magdalena delta, resulting in a grim humour (in 2010 counter-insurgency troops decorated a 50-metre tree with Christmas lights to encourage guerrillas to hand in their weapons over the festive season).</p> <p>Some of the best sections of the book illuminate the lives of ordinary people desperate for stability. Feiling is instinctively sceptical of privilege \u2013 the Facebook-using, cocktail-drinking young people of Bogot\u00e1's rich suburbs and western backpackers get short shrift. But he paints sympathetic portraits of Colombianos such as Pedro of the indigenous <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/nukak\" title=\"\">Nukak</a> people, chased&#xa0;from his nomadic jungle lifestyle by guerrillas.</p> <p><em>Short Walks from Bogot\u00e1</em> doesn't offer light beach reading for Colombia novices, but those who persist will find important insights into what Feiling calls \"the most obsessive and introspective of all countries\". </p>",

That same certain sort of glam fan never stops being thrilled by the nerve and verve of Roxy Music giving a credit on their debut LP to the person who did their clothes, hair and makeup. Supposedly this was a dissident blow against rock's anti-fashion stance. Cutting through the stale dope-smoke fug of the hippie hangover, Roxy were \"the first true band of the 70s\". But they also prophesied the 80s, their celebration of posing and artifice anticipating postmodernism, the new romantics, the <em>Face</em>, pop video and self-reinventing superstars like Madonna.</p> <p>Which isn't untrue, but isn't the whole truth either. It's hardly the case that Roxy or Bowie invented the idea of image or were the first rockers to have close relationships with designers and stylists. Most 1960s British bands took an interest in clothes and hair. Nor were Bowie or Roxy's Brian Eno the first flamboyantly androgynous figures in rock.

We supported Bowie at the Greyhound in Croydon in June 1972: Bowie in his full Ziggy Stardust gear and us in all our regalia, performing to just 150 people in this little upstairs room. It was a tiny stage but it had theatrical lighting, so you had to wear make-up because that's what theatre people do, otherwise you look washed-out.\"</p> <p>John Lennon once quipped that glam was just rock'n'roll with lipstick. Glam historians tend to emphasise the lipstick at the expense of the rock'n'roll; they focus overly on the gender-bending rather than the genre-bending. In Roxy's case, the attention paid to the group's fashion world connections, pop art allegiances and other extra-musical credentials threatens to overshadow their achievements as a rock band. In truth, Eno's feather boas, Bryan Ferry's gaucho look of 1974\u2026 they haven't aged that well. It's hard to believe that wearing a white dinner jacket was ever a big deal. Even the celebrated covers of the first five albums, with their lingerie-clad models, look cheesy and chauvinist these days (apart from the still-edgy sleeve of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Roxy_Music_-_For_Your_Pleasure_(Polydor_1973_LP).jpg\" title=\"\"><em>For Your Pleasure</em></a>, a perversely stylised shot of Amanda Lear walking a panther). The music, though, remains timeless in its weirdness and wildness.</p> <p>What gets swept under the carpet by the \"first true band of the 70s\" argument is that the Roxy Music of the first three albums is a post-psychedelic outfit: as much progressive rock as glam rock. Manzanera recalls listening recently for the first time in ages to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX8XbSiEzPQ\" title=\"\">The Bob (Medley)</a>, the six-part song-suite on 1972's <em>Roxy Music</em>, a sort of \"mini-movie\" concept piece about the second world war. \"This guy is remixing our debut LP in 5.1 surround sound, so I was listening to The Bob and I was laughing. It's pure prog. The whole of that first album sounds so weird. It's such a mish-mash of stuff. Roxy just wouldn't get signed today.\"</p> <p>Those who view Roxy as pioneers of surface-deep postmodern pop regard the band as radically opposed to the earthy earnestness of what was then known as the underground: long-haired, beardy bands like Soft Machine and Family who played the college gig circuit, recorded sessions for John Peel, appeared on <em>The Old Grey Whistle Test</em> and got written up in <em>Melody Maker</em>. But Roxy's earliest champions were, in fact, John Peel, who invited them to record a session for his show, <em>Melody Maker</em>'s Richard Williams, who got the hype ball rolling, and management company EG, whose other clients included King Crimson and ELP, and who hitched Roxy up with Island Records, the leading progressive label of the era. At one point Ferry actually auditioned to be King Crimson's singer. And before Manzanera got the gig, the group's guitarist was David O'List, formerly of the Nice, the original prog band.</p> <p>Early on, Ferry went along with the progressive scene's disdain for chart pop, declaring: \"We're not a singles band, really. I certainly don't want to find myself sliding down the Slade/T Rex corridor of horror.\" Even in hindsight, he recalled that Roxy \"didn't think we were as commercial as what other people were doing\u2026 When we started, I think we thought we'd be a kind of art-student band, and that's as far as it would go\u2026 King Crimson were one polar extreme, Bowie was the other and we were in the middle. I was astounded when we had a hit record.\"</p> <p>More than half the band \u2013 Manzanera, Eno, Andy Mackay, Paul Thompson \u2013 came from experimental music, trippy-proggy or heavy rock backgrounds. \"We had some weird things that other bands didn't have, like someone playing oboe,\" Manzanera says of Mackay, who was classically trained and whose interest in the avant garde later resulted in the fine book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780714821764/electronic-music-the-instruments-the-music-the-musicians\" title=\"\"><em>Electronic Music</em></a>. Manzanera's previous band were Quiet Sun, an outfit influenced by Zappa, Pink Floyd and Soft Machine, while drummer Thompson worshipped Led Zep's John Bonham. A fan of minimalist composers like Steve Reich, Eno was a non-musician who supplied Roxy with irruptions of abstract synth and tape effects: things that were \"part of experimental electronic music\", recalls Manzanera, \"but we used them in the context of songs\".</p> <p>The songs themselves weren't exactly conventional either. Some, like The Bob or If There Is Something were more like several songs joined together. Others, like the first two singles, Virginia Plain and Pyjamarama, would be judged unfinished by the standards of hit factories like the Brill building or Motown. Neither has a chorus, just a single verse melody repeated.</p> <p>This minimalist aspect to Roxy Music came from one of the motley crew's few shared passions: the Velvet Underground. But there were also upsurges of maximalism, acid rock flashbacks like the second half of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Every_Dream_Home_a_Heartache\" title=\"\">In Every Dream Home a Heartache</a>, with its phased drumming and gaseously billowing guitar. \"That was my chance to vent my inner psychedelia,\" Manzanera laughs. Even more far out is the title track/finale to <em>For Your Pleasure</em>, especially its hallucinatory extended coda of pointillistic piano trills, like the Milky Way going down the cosmic plughole. The product of the strong bond Manzanera formed with Eno, <em>For Your Pleasure</em> is comparable with Hendrix circa <em>Electric Ladyland</em> or Tim Buckley's <em>Starsailor</em> in its use of the studio and recording tape as a canvas for sound painting.</p> <p>In late 1973, looking back at the first two Roxy albums not long after he was pushed out of the band, Eno enthused about the music's \"insanity\u2026 the element of clumsiness and grotesqueness\", the \"terrific tension\", caused by the group \"juxtaposing things that didn't naturally sit together\". Even after Eno's departure, Manzanera continued to pursue the absurdism and studio-boffin experimentation on the third album, <em>Stranded</em>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQQvw3l2vJs\" title=\"\">Amazona</a>, for instance, is split apart by an indescribably strange guitar solo midway between a fire storm and a gigantic bubble machine. It sounds like the work of several guitarists but it's just Manzanera playing through a complex relay of distortion, repeat echoes and vari-pitch, using a specially built contraption that worked just once. That first and only take is what you hear on the album.</p> <p>Amazona was the first song on a Roxy album for which Manzanera received a credit. Because music publishing operates according to an antiquated, pre-rock conception of composition that rewards those who write the top-line melody and lyrics, most Roxy tunes are credited solely to Ferry. \"It goes back to Tin Pan Alley and the 1930s,\" says Manzanera. \"Eno's synth part on Ladytron, Andy's oboe parts \u2013 that came from them. Each member was contributing to the music and to all the arrangements. I like to think that we produced the musical context for Bryan to put his vision into. But that's not reflected in the publishing.\"</p> <p>It's all the more unfair because, according to Manzanera, from about halfway through <em>For Your Pleasure</em> and onwards, the band would write \"the music first \u2013 all the music, including the solos. Then Bryan would listen to it and try to write a top-line tune and words. When it worked, it was absolutely brilliant. Because none of us knew what the song was going to be about until he recorded the vocal. Imagine, you've been working on Love Is the Drug for absolutely ages, with no idea that it's even going to be called Love Is the Drug. Then Bryan turns up, and he sings it, and we're like, 'bloody hell, we've got a single'.\"</p> <p>Rather than the players \"backing\" their singer/leader, then, it would be more accurate to say that Ferry fronted them: many of Roxy's greatest songs would never have been written in the absence of what had been generated first by the musicians. Which is not to downplay the importance of Ferry's \"completion\" role. <em>Stranded</em>'s high point, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4J6Uyv0JDY\" title=\"\">Mother of Pearl</a>, would be a fabulous instrumental but it would not have a fraction of its emotional power without Ferry's words or his incredible vocal performance, where every line, every word even, is delivered with a deranged archness of emphasis, suffusing the entire song with bitter, poisoned campness. In purely musical terms, Ferry's greatest invention is his voice on the first two albums, the reptilian vibrato that paved the way for neurotic new wave mandroids like Gary Numan and Devo. As much as the jarring and jolting music, Ferry's grotesquely stylised singing contributed the aspect of \"insanity\" that Eno valued in early Roxy.</p> <p>There's no doubt that Roxy was Ferry's \"baby\". He formed the group and formulated its overall vision and framing. But, curiously, what becomes apparent as you follow the band's arc through the eight albums (plus one double CD of B-sides and outtakes) corralled in the new box set, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/02/roxy-music-complete-recordings-review\" title=\"\">The Complete Studio Recordings</a>, is that as Ferry gradually asserts total control over the band, the music becomes less characterful. The individuality of the players, that strange \"mish-mash\"/mismatch Manzanera speaks of, starts to fade, and so too does the collective character of Roxy as an entity set apart from the landscape of pop.</p> <p>This smoothing-out begins to set in circa 1974-75 with <em>Country Life</em> and <em>Siren</em>. It's in full swing with the reformed Roxy of <em>Manifesto</em> and <em>Flesh + Blood</em>, where Roxy are playing the game of pop according to the radio and dance-floor rules of the disco/new wave late 70s and early 80s. And playing it well: there's no denying the grace of Oh Yeah and Over You, and the shimmer and shiver of Same Old Scene.</p> <p>The same syndrome affects the lyrics: the verbosity and over-ripeness of the early albums goes, but so too does the imagistic vividness, the unclassifiably mixed emotions. \"Songs like Mother of Pearl had masses of words,\" recalls Manzanera. \"In Roxy's first five years there's a lot more witty metaphors and wordplay. But it got more serious gradually, and by the end you had a bunch of haikus, virtually.\"</p> <p>By <em>Avalon</em> and its big single More Than This, the sound is all patina, glistening with professionalism and perfectionism. The words sketch the barest suggestion of mood; the voice, once so blood-curdling and startling, has become a debonair croon, evoking just a faded and jaded gentility. Ferry has not just annulled the personalities of Manzanera and Mackay, who might as well be session players like the other hirelings credited, he's erased himself too. Immaculate background music, <em>Avalon</em> could be seen as Ferry's own version of ambient music: an \"I can do that too\" riposte to Eno's reputation as doyen of the cutting edge. A triumph, in its way, but also a tragic inversion of everything that made Roxy so arresting.</p>",
  "<p>'Welcome back to an exciting new school year for all of us here in the Department for Education. First, the good news: at long last, our examination results are down. With our planned changes to assessment and the focus on harder GCSEs we can predict even bigger declines in the years to come.</p> <p>\"This year will also see new grammar tests for 11-year-olds. We confidently expect initially poor results that will gradually improve as schools learn to teach to the test, leaving plenty of room for a future administration to respond to media charges that it has been dumbed down.</p> <p>\"This year, we will face many financial pressures. But we will not allow our commitment to turn all schools into academies or free schools to be tempered by the fact that as more establishments convert the correlation between being an academy and achieving better results seems likely to disappear.\"</p> <p>Being one of our most effective political orators (and operators) I am sure the secretary of state for education could find a more eloquent way of laying out his department's ambitious programme. Nor would Michael Gove be too worried about the apparent tensions between different policy goals. Indeed, like Tony Blair and New Labour's education guru Andrew Adonis, he would find accusations of inconsistency and irresponsibility emerging from the educational establishment as comforting evidence that he must be doing the right thing.</p> <p>Behind differences of emphasis and method the central feature of political discourse about English education is the deeply held assumption that educational standards are falling and that we are lagging further behind the rest of the world. Under this assumption, anyone who questions any aspect of reform is quickly portrayed as an apologist for failure. In my time in Number 10, back in 2004, I remember being internally exiled for being heard to ask how the education department would cope when it was directly managing 200 academies (the figure is now in the thousands but the question still hasn't been answered).</p> <p>The declinist narrative \u2013 what education expert Professor Stephen Ball called \"the mobilising myth of education in crisis\" \u2013 roughly tracks the loss of British influence in the world: 19th-century policy-makers were fretting about the higher skills of German workers. A key moment in more recent times was <a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/thegreatdebate/story/0,9860,574645,00.html\" title=\"\">Jim Callaghan's powerful 1976 Ruskin College</a> speech in which he shocked the \"secret garden\" of the educational establishment by calling for a great debate on education standards, particularly the performance of working-class pupils. Since then, the rhetoric of decline and the pace of reform have accelerated hand in hand.</p> <p>Much of what has changed since then has been for the better. Few would want to return to the days when headteachers had to get council approval before cutting the school's verges. Greater accountability, stronger inspection and more diversity among school providers have made major inroads into the long and fat tail of under-performing schools.</p> <p>In the capital, the combination of national policy and the <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/london-challenge\" title=\"\">London Challenge</a> programme has seen a city once plagued by failing establishments now among the highest national performers. The widespread recognition that teacher quality is the sine qua non of success is welcome as is the evidence that we have today the most accomplished teaching force ever.</p> <p>Indeed, one of the problems with the assumption of decline is an unwillingness to identify success and also to recognise how the old establishment has, however grudgingly, adapted.</p> <p>For example, most local authorities, of all political persuasions, have accepted that they have lost their empire and now have to find a role. I am leading an inquiry on school standards for Conservative Suffolk County Council, where local politicians have no desire to run schools but have a huge appetite for new ways to help them collaborate around improvement. Yet the other day I heard a backbench MP attribute \"widespread\" school underperformance to the dead hand of council control, a charge fast becoming as credible as blaming the Luftwaffe for our housing shortage.</p> <p>The simple truth about educational attainment in England is that standards have risen significantly but not as quickly as a well-intentioned policy of improving exam performance. The evidence, albeit based on questionable data, of relegation in the international standards league table is of concern, but by far the greatest weakness of our system \u2013 huge class-related inequalities in outcome \u2013 is much more to do with factors outside school (economic inequality and the effect of parental choices) than inside.</p> <p>Despite the political narrative, other countries think they have things to learn from us. The <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/\" title=\"\">Royal Society of Arts</a> is the proud sponsor of a small family of academies and the champion of a more collaborative, competency-based approach to children's learning. In the last two years, we have had a stream of visitors from countries, including China, exploring a move away from a focus on rote learning as employers increasingly demand the softer skills of creativity, self-confidence and teamwork.</p> <p>Indeed, there is a major educational experiment taking place within the UK. The Scots are just finishing the decade-long implementation of a new, more flexible, child-centred and competency-based curriculum, backed by almost the whole educational establishment and provided by its monopoly of public sector schools overseen by local councils. There are no plans for academies, free schools or league tables.</p> <p>I am no more a fan of public sector provider monopolies than an opponent of the principle of free schools, but spend time in a cross-section of English schools. It is impossible not to sense the demoralisation and insecurity caused by the steady drumbeat of negative rhetoric and continuous policy revolution.</p> <p>Speaking when it was the liberal left who were driving reform, the Tory MP and educationalist Rhodes Boyson, who died last week, spoke of \"a dangerous, neurotic desire for change\". If Michael Gove wants to cock a snook at political orthodoxy he could use his forthcoming conference speech to commit to working with teachers, parents, local authorities, employers and upils, to build a long-term consensus for further steady improvement. That would be a radical break with the recent past.</p>",
  "<p>Last Thursday I had a small adventure, the kind of thrill a big city can often throw up, if only you put in a little forward planning. It wasn't a promising morning: a soft rain was falling, and the sky was old-knicker grey. Nor was my destination exotic: Kilburn High Road, a relentless drag of kebab shops and charity shops. When I arrived at the precise spot, a dilapidated construction known as the Tin Tabernacle, I could find no way inside.&#xa0;But then\u2026 salvation! Someone showed me a bell, high above my head, and soon after ringing it, I walked into one of the most marvellous spaces I've seen in a long time. For me, this was love at first sight.</p> <p>The Tin Tabernacle was built in 1863 by a developer called James Bailey. I say \"built\", but this is pushing it, really. Unlike Bailey's other projects \u2013 he specialised in the terraced houses you can still see in this part of north-west London today \u2013 this one came straight from the pages of a catalogue. Made of corrugated iron, it was a flat-pack church of the same ilk as the sweaty \"God boxes\" that were delivered to distant outposts of the Empire. It cost less than \u00a31,000 and was intended only to be temporary. In the fullness of time, or so Bailey believed, the local Congregationalists would raise enough money to build a chapel all of their own.</p> <p>In the end, though, this never happened, and the tabernacle lived on. In 1947 it was taken over by the Willesden &amp; St Marylebone Sea Cadets, the charity that remains its custodian; the building is now grade II listed. This applies only to the exterior, which is a pity, for it's the interior that makes the eyes pop. In the 1950s the inside of the tabernacle was transformed by a group of local men so as to resemble the inside of a Royal Navy ship. There are portholes and rigging, a boatswain's store and a wardroom, and a proper bridge, complete with wheel and a full set of engine order telegraphs. Also, smack in the middle of the main deck, is a 1943 anti-aircraft gun.</p> <p>Not that I knew any of this at first. For the next few weeks the Tin Tabernacle is home to <a href=\"http://www.artangel.org.uk//projects/2012/nowhere_less_now/about_the_project/nowhere_less_now\" title=\"\">an installation by the artist Lindsay Seers</a> (a commission by Artangel, the remarkable charity which seeks to take art out of the gallery and into the world), and it's part of her design that visitors find out the peculiar nature of the building little by little. In the beginning I saw only the wardroom, with its tiny bar and a sign that urges officers to check they are correctly dressed. This is where you wait before the show begins, and it's adorable.</p> <p>Seers works in film, constructing complex narratives that are mostly fiction but which have their roots in autobiography. When she started talking to the people at Artangel they took her to the tabernacle on a kind of blind date, and I'm guessing that, like me, she fell hard in love. For her, though, the building has an extra resonance. Seers's great great uncle, George Edwards, who was born in 1866, was a sea cadet who joined the merchant navy and sailed to Zanzibar, where he was involved in British efforts to dismantle the local slave trade. Look at the walls of the tabernacle's wardroom and it's possible&#xa0;you will find a photograph of George. You can't miss him. He has a distinctive appearance. His eyes were different colours.</p> <p>Seers's film, <em>Nowhere Less Now</em>, is shown on two screens, one flat and round, the other spherical. In the flickering gloom you think, of course, of lenses, of George's eyes. But these screens also put you in mind of human eggs (his condition, heterochromia, was genetic), and of portholes. The narrative is multilayered, and stable as quicksand. It looks back to George's life onboard HMS Dragon, but also forward to a future in which photographs have been banned (those lucky enough to be in possession of a photograph must gaze on it in secret, gathering with others in a temporary structure not unlike the tabernacle). Seers also travels to Zanzibar, where George eventually drowned, and to Dar es Salaam, where she finds another church of corrugated iron. Unanswered questions hang heavy in the air. What compelled George's wife, Georgina, to wear a dress of such strange, Masonic design? (Seers films herself in something similar, with macabre results.) What happened to Seers's stepsister, who went missing as a child? And was it her uncle who carved his name on a huge baobab tree on Cemetery Island, or some other sailor called George?</p> <p>After 20 minutes the film ends. Too soon. As the lights come up, you're still puzzling things out (a feeling that will last for days, and probably for ever). It takes a moment, then, to notice what the dark previously concealed: that Seers has made her own additions to the folk-art interior of the tabernacle, and that you're sitting in what appears to be the upturned hull of a ship. Knock its sides with a knuckle and you will hear the stark clank of metal. The disorientation doesn't end here. Afterwards, free to explore, I wandered into a tiny side chapel. It has a medieval altar and a lectern whose base is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a cloven hoof. The effect was uncanny. Outside, the traffic rumbled; Kilburn could not be more landlocked if it tried. But in the strange quiet of the Tin Tabernacle I was lost at sea, overwhelmed by a briny wave of doubt and confusion.</p>",
  "<p>The latest film adaptation of Tolstoy's <em>Anna Karenina</em> began in what Tom Stoppard calls \"a normal kind of way\", though it did not exactly have a normal outcome. Sitting in his penthouse flat in west London with his back to a stunning view of the Thames, he lights the first of the six cigarettes that will measure out this conversation.</p> <p>\"Somebody rang my agent, Anthony Jones,\" he says, before adding: \"It was to ask if I was up for adapting <em>Anna Karenina</em> for Joe Wright. It was Joe's choice of movie.\"</p> <p>This is an ideal moment to talk to one of Britain's leading contemporary playwrights. Stoppard is in that limbo that writers experience when the work is done and dusted, before the public has really caught up and cast its vote. Indeed, this late summer season is blessed with not one, but two, Stoppard screen adaptations. His version of<em> Parade's End</em> by Ford Madox Ford, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall, which we'll come to, is winning golden opinions on BBC2.</p> <p>Speaking of his <em>Anna Karenina</em>, which stars Keira Knightley in the title role, Stoppard says that Wright's commission came at a good time. He'd finished the script of <em>Parade's End</em>, and had no stage play in mind. Writing a screenplay, he says, is like writing left-handed: \"It doesn't feel like a continuation of my writing life. It's an interruption, but a welcome one, especially if I haven't got a play on.\"</p> <p>Perhaps only a dramatist of Stoppard's stature and experience could welcome the invitation to turn Tolstoy's masterpiece into cinema. It's a daunting prospect: the novel is more than 800 pages in the excellent Penguin Classics translation, by the husband and wife team of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. And still more demanding, the story of the beautiful married woman who falls hopelessly in love with the dashing cavalry officer but eventually throws herself under a train in despair has become as familiar to audiences as <em>Hamlet</em> or <em>The Odyssey</em>.</p> <p>And that's before you've begun to take on board the novel's cinematic history. By the most casual inventory, there have been at least 12 screen versions, ranging from the Greta Garbo classic (1935), to the Vivien Leigh and Ralph Richardson version of 1948, an American silent movie, entitled <em>Love</em>, which somehow contrived a happy ending, and even an Egyptian version <em>Nahr al-Hob</em> (River of Love) made in 1960.</p> <p>So where did he start? \"I actually watched several <em>Anna Kareninas</em>,\" he says. \"At screenplay school, I'm sure they tell you not to watch the previous attempts. But I found it irresistible. Also, I'd never seen a Garbo film. Ever. I was fascinated by that. So I saw Garbo and I saw Vivien Leigh. And there was a BBC version, that was the best for me, because it was six hours.\"</p> <p>He also reread the novel, of course, for the first time in 30 or 40 years. \"I felt quite \u2026\" he hesitates, \"I don't know what the word is, but I felt I was under greater <em>surveillance</em> by Tolstoy compared to Ford Madox Ford. It's a wonderful novel with some great set-pieces, like Vronsky's steeplechase. The big question, for me, on getting to know the book again, was what to do with the second story, the Levin story.\"</p> <p>There's the additional problem that the Levin chapters of the novel contain many long discussions about local government, and estate management. \"It's as though,\" Stoppard jokes, \"Tolstoy took the big essay at the end of <em>War and Peace</em> and said to himself, 'I'd better spread this through the whole story next time.'\"</p> <p>But Levin (modelled on Tolstoy himself) is important. The parallel, shy relationship between Levin and Kitty (superbly played by Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander) is used by Tolstoy to counterpoint Anna's affair. \"For a while,\" Stoppard continues, \"I thought we should ignore everything and just go hell for leather, and into, and through, and out of, this relentless love affair. I was going to make it like a very fast modern movie, which was all about being in lust.\" In the end, he says, \"wiser counsels prevailed, including my own\". He delivered a script of about 130 pages \u2013 in movie terms, a film of about two-and-a-half hours.</p> <p>The idea of the film, at this point, was, he says, \"to deal seriously with the subject of love\" as it applies to several pairs of characters, Anna and Vronsky (Keira Knightley and Aaron Johnson), Anna and her husband (played by Jude Law), Levin and Kitty. The word \"love\" was intended to chime through the script to indicate various kinds of loving, from adulterous infatuation to marital contentment.</p> <p>So far, so normal. But here's the thing: when Wright's film opens, the audience finds itself pitched not into imperial Russia but into a stunning visual metaphor, a dilapidated 19th-century Russian theatre. The stalls, boxes, scene docks, dressing rooms and backstage theatrical clutter become the setting for all the Moscow and St Petersburg parts of the novel, a stark, and highly stylised, contrast with the more conventional and naturalistic scenes set on Levin's estate (actually, Salisbury Plain).</p> <p>So what happened?</p> <p>After the preview, and in anticipation of this interview, I had imagined, at this point, Stoppard would confide that, as a man of the theatre, he had conceived the idea of framing his adaptation with a cinematic proscenium arch. But this, it turns out, is not the case. He seems still to be coming to terms with Wright's directorial coup.</p> <p>\"No, I didn't have this idea at any point,\" he insists. \"The script was done and Joe went off to location scout in Russia.\" But, for various reasons, this recce was unsatisfactory, and Wright continued to look for locations in England, without much luck.</p> <p>\"He called me up, and said, 'Can I see you urgently?' He came round with a big file and exhibited his idea \u2013 essentially that the Moscow and St Petersburg scenes should take place in a 19th-century theatre \u2013 on my kitchen table.\"</p> <p>Was this to do with budget problems? Stoppard shakes his head. \"Joe needed a concept to get excited about doing the novel as a movie. I think he talked to Keira about it \u2013 <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> had worked out really well for them \u2013 and this was what he came up with.\"</p> <p>Another cigarette. A pause. \"It was a bit of a shock,\" he continues, \"but the shock was ameliorated by Joe's wanting no changes in the script. He shot my script,\" Stoppard concludes, with satisfaction.</p> <p>Indeed he did. Wright's version is a directorial tour de force propelled by Dario Marianelli's headlong score. Every frame is stamped with an overwrought aesthetic sensibility that transforms what might have been a naturalistic costume drama into the mannered pirouette of a theatrical ensemble swept along in a classic Russian romance.</p> <p>This <em>Anna Karenina</em> is probably not the film Stoppard envisaged, and he concedes to \"various worries\" about the decision to place the drama in a single location \u2013 basically, a Shepperton sound stage. However, he adds that: \"My fundamental sense is that I'm much more interested by what Joe has done \u2013 and I'm not as worried as I might have been if I had been the screenwriter of the 47th immaculate costume drama [from the BBC], another classic, well-dressed, romantic drama.\"</p> <p>For that kind of satisfaction, the Stoppard fan must turn to <em>Parade's End</em>, a labour of love to which Stoppard has devoted several years. He confesses now that \"it feels too long since my last stage play [<em>Rock'n'Roll</em>, which premiered at the Royal Court in 2006]. <em>Parade's End</em> is the reason, but I don't mind. I had delusions of proprietorship with those characters.\" Compared to <em>Anna Karenina</em>, he says, \"<em>Parade's End</em>&#xa0;felt much more like my own work,\"&#xa0;adding that, \"I invented much more\".</p> <p>That's true enough. But Stoppard's late fascination with the secret anatomy of love, a turning away from the argumentative verbal fireworks of plays such as <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em> and <em>Jumpers</em>, is braided into every line of <em>Anna Karenina</em>. He says he wanted to examine what happens to a married woman, Anna, who discovers sex for the first time, a theme possibly of greater relevance today than might generally be admitted.</p> <p>In quest of this, he gives Anna some wonderfully resonant lines. After her first experience of love-making with Vronsky, she murmurs, \"You have murdered my happiness\", a subtle and complicated sentiment that shortly becomes: \"So this is love \u2026 This!\"</p> <p>Stoppard believes that \"what Tolstoy is on about is that carnal love is not a good idea\". The script also takes him back into territory \u2013 infidelity \u2013 that he explored on stage in <em>The Real Thing</em>. Today, he is at pains to draw a clear distinction between St Petersburg in the 1870s and London in the 1980s. \"Russian society was not exactly a hotbed of chastity,\" he says, relishing the oxymoron. \"Anna comes to grief because she has fallen in love for the first time.\"</p> <p>I wonder, en passant, if the Czech part of Tom Stoppard (born Tomas Straussler in 1937) responds to Tolstoy, the Slav, but this won't fly. He shakes his head. \"I don't think falling in love in Slovakia is much different from falling in love in Tunbridge Wells,\" he replies.</p> <p>Speaking of romance, more generally, he admits that, as he grows older, \"it's not of less interest. If anything, I think, it becomes more important. My&#xa0;own progress has been from thinking that it was unimportant, that it was the play of minds that kept a play crackling.\"</p> <p>He has come to see that the heart is quite as dependable an engine of drama as the head. \"In <em>Rock'n'Roll</em>, I was basically doing the Prague spring, the politics of 1968, but I came to understand that \u2013 for the audience \u2013 the play works as a love story. Now I tend to look for ways to introduce what you call 'romance' into what is ostensibly the 'real' topic, the politics, the ideas, or&#xa0;whatever.\"</p> <p>With a closing laugh, Stoppard stubs out his last cigarette. \"Actually, if the 'real' topic is my only topic, I may be in trouble.\" Does he have any explanation for this transition from the cerebral and argumentative play of ideas (<em>Travesties</em>; <em>Arcadia</em>) to something warmer and fuzzier? A sheepish look, after which we say goodbye. \"The truth of the matter,\" he replies, \"is that I used to be much more \u2013 as it were \u2013 shy. Now I don't care!\"</p>",
  "<p>This year at <a href=\"http://www.londondesignfestival.com/\" title=\"\">London Design festival</a> (LDF) <a href=\"http://designmuseum.org/design/tom-dixon\" title=\"\">Tom Dixon</a> wants everyone to see the light. Each year he hosts an event for LDF at the Dock, his west London HQ, which is housed in a converted Victorian wharf building on the Grand Union canal, and this year's theme is luminosity. \"It's a call to arms, a message to remember that lights aren't sculptures \u2013 they illuminate, and we need to illuminate people's perceptions,\" he says. \"We talk about the light fittings, how they're made, what the influences are, but we've forgotten to talk about the light itself. It's a mysterious field full of technical appellations such as lumen and wattage\u2026 there's a lot of learning involved. I felt people might be interested.\"</p> <p>The self-taught furniture designer served as Habitat's head of design and then creative director from 1998 to 2008. He is responsible for Italian brand Cappellini's famous <a href=\"http://chaircards.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/cappellini-s-chair-tom-dixon/\" title=\"\">S chair</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/who-was-your-first-your-first-75753\" title=\"\">Jack lamp</a> and <a href=\"http://www.designiq.net/tom-dixon-plump-sofa\" title=\"\">Plump sofa</a> have become icons of British design. If Dixon is interested in light, chances are the rest of us will be very soon. He's even excited by the legislation on lightbulbs: \"Rules, scientific discoveries, they all change things\u2026 open it up for designers.\"</p> <p>He's looking forward to LDF as a chance to open up the Dock to more visitors. The building houses his workshop, a restaurant, a tea shop (Tart, run by his elder daughter, Florence) and a shop full of beautiful, extend-the-overdraft furnishings. \"I'm super-privileged to have a space like this in London so that I can invite a few pals from the Eurozone to show here during LDF,\" he says. \"It's dozy and relaxed here most of the time, so it's good to get everybody tensed up and ready to perform.\"</p> <p>LDF celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, and Dixon feels that the past decade has been good for British design (though he could have done without the revival of baroque ornamentation and the re-emergence of Formica and patterned surfaces). But as the man who has spent his life creating objects of desire for others, is there anything he wished he owned himself? \"I don't covet,\" he says. \"I'm collecting heads at the moment \u2013 busts, many of them life-size, I have an attachment to them. I'd prefer a lovely building to a lovely object. I've got a water tower across the road. It's a folly, it had no purpose [it was decommissioned], which I liked. Also, I'm a typical boy: I'd really like a bridge.\"</p>",
  "<p>Armando Iannucci has a confession to make. \"The thing is, I don't despise them,\" he says. \"I've always been fascinated by politics. Read up on political history. Love all the election shows. I am a political geek.\"</p> <p>At the age of 14 or 15, he would take himself off to a public library in Glasgow to read Hansard. I remark that William Hague is the only other person who has ever been heard admitting to the nerdish compulsion to read the parliamentary record as a teenager. \"Yeah,\" he nods, wincing slightly. \"I know.\"</p> <p>We have met for lunch in a break between final edits of the new series of <em>The Thick of It</em>. The hugely acclaimed comedy has achieved the rare feat of being a hit with viewers, channel controllers, critics, juries of TV awards and the targets of its superbly realised satire. It has not only influenced how viewing voters think about government, it is also a reference point for how the practitioners of politics perceive themselves. I tell him that, in the 48 hours before we meet, I have heard a Downing Street official describe a meeting at Number 10 as \"like a scene from<strong> </strong><em>The Thick of It</em><strong>\"</strong>, and a senior aide to Ed Miliband has told me of a conversation in the Labour leader's office \"so surreal it could have been scripted by Armando Iannucci\".</p> <p>He has always taken meticulous care to make the show feel real, so he is bound to be tickled by approving notices from his victims. He recalls meeting James Purnell, who was culture secretary at the time, at a Royal Television Society dinner. They talked about the very first episode when the cast are in the back of a car feverishly trying to concoct a policy on the hoof. Purnell said: \"I've been in the back of that car.\"</p> <p>When<strong> </strong><em>The Thick of It</em><strong> </strong>was last on screen three years ago, Labour was still in power<strong> </strong>and therefore the primary target. The latest \u2013 and, he reveals to me, probably the last \u2013 series begins by training its sights on the coalition. Peter Mannion, the world-weary, technologically inept old-school Tory played by Roger Allam, channelling a substantial helping of Ken Clarke, is now in charge at Dosac, the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship. He is in uncomfortable tandem with a minister from \"the Inbetweeners\", as the Lib Dems are called. There is a natural comic dynamic from the two of them \"trying to look like a public united front but secretly trying to get the credit for whichever policy\". Dosac's former Labour boss, the hapless Nicola Murray<strong>, </strong>played by Rebecca Front, has become leader of the opposition by a quirk of the block vote mechanism that no one understands. The cast may have shuffled positions, but the animating spirit of the satire remains the same: the cunning plans of the political class come farcically unstuck in ways that reveal them to be clueless, hopeless and powerless.</p> <p>Iannucci makes viewers wait for the return of his mesmerising monster. It is not until episode 2 that we are reintroduced to Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker, the confabulation of all that is most foul about spin doctors. I wonder if his creator ever worries that his most loathsome character is also his most popular. \"Yes, I do worry. I find it very worrying.\" He finds it especially anxiety-inducing when he meets real-life spin doctors because \"they always talk about how much they like Malcolm and<strong> </strong>how they try and emulate Malcolm. And I think, have we got this wrong?\" When the production went to film in Downing Street, some of the inhabitants of Number 10 came out, wanting to have their pictures taken with Capaldi/Tucker. \"Obviously, we all look forward to the Malcolm moments in the same way we look forward to the Darth Vader moments in <em>Star Wars</em> and Satan's speeches in <em>Paradise Lost</em>. But isn't he meant to be a horrible cunt? Isn't that who Malcolm is? So why are all these people saying, 'Do you know the one I want to be? I want to be the horrible cunt.' Doesn't that say something about politics?\"</p> <p>Perhaps it does. Perhaps it also says something important and not very healthy about the impact of what he puts on our screens. I love <em>The Thick of It</em>, but I tell him that I am also gnawed by a worm of anxiety that there are viewers who will take it not as a satire of some of the worst dimensions of politics but a representation of the totality of politics. When the denizens of his version of Westminster can't organise a photo opportunity without collapsing into calamity, never mind execute a policy that might improve someone's life, what is he trying to say about government to voters? He responds that the show \"never set out to have an agenda. It wasn't a manifesto. It was entertainment.\"</p> <p>The principal driver has always been comedic. \"We see these grand looking buildings down Whitehall. So you assume the people within them kind of know what they're doing with power. And part of the comedy is going through those doors and discovering that they don't really. Although it's a big job, it's actually little people.\"</p> <p>The contrast between the outward pomp and the inner reality also drives the comedy of <a href=\"http://skyatlantic.sky.com/shows/veep\" title=\"\"><em>Veep</em></a>, his American show screened in Britain on Sky Atlantic. Taking his satire across the Atlantic entailed some risk, I suggest, because Americans tend to idealise their democracy much more than the British.&#xa0;\"I think you're right. The interesting thing in America is how much they respect the office even though they're contemptuous of the office-holder. A lot of people were asking, do you think America is going to be ready for this? I thought I was going to get, what brings you here, a Brit, telling us about our politics?\"</p> <p>As it turns out, the show is another hit. If there was any hate mail from outraged Americans \"it hasn't got to me \u2013 probably goes to HBO\". It's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/03/julia-louis-dreyfus-emmy-veep_n_1735534.html\" title=\"\">up for an Emmy</a> and HBO has commissioned a second season. Three researchers were employed in Washington to help with the \"accuracy\", and he worked \"very closely with the cast\" to avoid scripting references or gags that wouldn't work for an American audience. After a while the actors stopped saying: \"We think that's a bit English.\" Instead, they made \"a set of noises\", an idea started by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who plays the title role. \"She would say, 'We think that's a bit haw-haw-haw.\"'</p> <p>The position of vice-president, described by one of its real-life occupants as \"not worth a bucket of warm piss\", has all the trappings of high office and no real power, making it the perfect subject for Iannucci. A running joke has the Veep asking her assistant: \"Did the president call?\" and always receiving a negative answer.</p> <p>How did the lad who got his teenage kicks from Hansard turn into our most gifted TV satirist, with shows bathed in praise on both sides of the Atlantic? I wonder if it's something in his Italian DNA. Italians have more reasons than most to feel betrayed by government. After mulling on it, Iannucci says he can see how his take on politics might have been shaped by his father. Before he emigrated to Britain, Dad was a journalist in Mussolini's Italy, wrote for an anti-fascist newspaper \"and then had to take to the hills and join the partisans, and as soon as the war was over he got out\". He found a new home in Glasgow but he wasn't a British citizen so he couldn't vote. \"I remember saying to him, 'Are you not frustrated you can't vote in the election?' He said, 'Well, the last election I remember, Mussolini got in.' So, you know: what good is your vote? Maybe it was that side.\"</p> <p>Mum was a first-generation immigrant. She was born in Glasgow but to an entirely Italian family. \"So it's all Italian blood.\" Yet his parents \"never brought us up speaking Italian because they thought it's better to feel integrated\". As a result, \"you feel Scottish, but not quite. But neither do you feel completely Italian. You're always slightly standing back from it and kind of observing\".</p> <p>Not sure whether you are inside or out?</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" he responds. \"Just, well, feeling half in and half out.\"</p> <p>Now, though, he is most definitely in with the British establishment. He has been begonged with the Order of the British Empire, an irony I want to spend some time teasing him about. You could easily imagine an episode of <em>The Thick of It</em> crafted around the comedy of pinning this Whitehall bauble on a man who makes his living from ridiculing government. Why accept an OBE? \"I thought it would be funny. That's why,\" he says, a touch defensively. Funny \u2013 how? \"I just think it's hilarious.\" He quickly adds: \"I mean, I'm not intending to use it or anything.\"</p> <p>So the credits of the new series don't say \"Armando Iannucci OBE\"?</p> <p>\"No,\" he recoils. \"I just think it's like\u2026 I mean either you accept awards or you don't. You know, either you put yourself forward for Baftas and whatever or you don't.\"</p> <p>Mmm. You win a Bafta because your peer group wants to salute outstanding work. You get an OBE because an official in the Cabinet Office has put you on a list.</p> <p>\"Someone must have nominated me,\" he protests. Or maybe some civil servants thought they would have the last laugh on the great satirist by dangling a morsel from the establishment's table in front of him to see whether he would gratefully bite. Didn't that occur to him?</p> <p>\"To be honest, I don't care if they think that. I don't care. I just thought it'd be funny and I was looking forward to ringing my mum and telling her.\"</p> <p>She was proud? \"Very pleased, yeah.\"</p> <p>This prompts me to the speculation that he accepted the OBE in part because of the ambivalent feelings about identity we had explored earlier. The honour was a badge of acceptance. He doesn't quarrel with this idea; indeed he eagerly embraces it as a much better explanation than the earlier ones he has offered. \"Yeah,\" he says vigorously. \"My grandfather [on his mother's side] was rounded up during the second world war and put in a camp because he was Italian. So there's that element: have we quite fitted in? Do people see us as British? So I can now say, right, OK, there you are, here's a document that proves it, so don't worry. Other than that, I see it as very nice, happy to get the recognition and then put it to one side and don't mention it again.\"</p> <p>Where would he stop? Is he hoping for a knighthood next?</p> <p>\"I think that would be taking the joke too far.\"</p> <p>A question I am keen to get my teeth into is whether the treatment given to politics on British television has gone beyond a joke. He may say he does not despise politicians, he may insist that his agenda is no more than comedic, but I want to investigate whether he feels any responsibility for the fact that so many of the British do hold politics in a deep contempt, a contempt that is often richly deserved but which can also be indiscriminate, lazy and ultimately poisonous for democracy. Iannucci describes himself as \"a sort of vague, woolly liberal with a small l. Left of centre-ish.\" Yet the moral we are invited to draw from his work is not at all \"left of centre-ish\". <em>The Thick of It</em> tells us that politics is a profession populated only by fools and knaves. The laughs nudge the viewer to the profoundly serious conclusion that all government is crap. Does he ever worry that, whether he means to or not, his message is basically the same as that of the Tea Party and Fox TV?</p> <p>\"Wow,\" he says, taken aback. \"I'm not sure it says government is crap. I think it says the people in government are crap.\"</p> <p>Does that make any difference? Either way, isn't he guiding the audience to the reactionary or nihilistic view that government is pointless? He approaches the question sideways by explaining how his thinking has developed. The first series of <em>The Thick of It</em> \"was very much coming in on the back of Blair and Iraq, and how did that happen?\" It was driven by an idea of Blair as \"someone with a domineering, centralised control over government\" with \"a group of bully boys, the enforcers, who would visit departments and just tell the minister this is what you say, this is your newest line to take, this is your view\". In the second series, \"I started feeling a little bit of sympathy for politicians. We the people put this pressure on them to be absolutely perfect, to not stumble, to have a fully thought-out, fully budgeted opinion on every topic we throw at them. Not to buy anything, not to have a salary, not to go on holiday, none of that. I actually started feeling sorry for them.\"</p> <p>Making this latest series has led him to a more fundamental conclusion. \"This time around I've kind of come at it with a feeling that the whole system just doesn't work. And it's primarily because we have a generation of politicians who have done nothing apart from politics. They do the politics degree, become a researcher, become an adviser, become an MP; they're in the cabinet by the time they're 39.\"</p> <p>True enough. Books have been written about the rise to dominance of a professional political class. Whatever their ideological differences, David Cameron, George Osborne, Ed Miliband, Ed Balls and Nick Clegg have this in common: they have spent all, or nearly all, of their adult lives in politics. Despite their lack of experience of anything else, says Iannucci, warming to this theme, \"the generation we have now running politics has felt all the more the need to interfere in minute detail in the working of every department. So it's not just about the big plans \u2013 like how many hospitals can we afford. It's what kind of books you should be reading, how to do homework. What we have are people with no experience, but trying to micro-manage.\"</p> <p>That is a speech, I remark, which would be welcomed with loud applause by many Tories. Absolutely right, they would cry: let's have much less government, sack most of the civil service, roll back the meddlesome state. He again protests that this is not his agenda. \"There's an alternative view. The machinery of government can work, but what you [the politician] need is not to feel that you are infallible. It's all right to take your time and actually listen to people with more specialist knowledge. Because the other thing that's weird is that someone could be running, say, the health service for 18 months and then overnight is in charge of the military or police or prisons \u2013 do you know what I mean?\"</p> <p>I do. Mind you, I have my doubts that government by \"experts\", also known as vested interests, would always prove to be a great experience for the voters. Is he saying that the army should answer only to generals, education policy should be made only by teachers and how we run jails should be the sole prerogative of prison officers?</p> <p>\"No, no, no, no, no,\" he responds. \"But I think what's happened, as you pointed out, is as they got less and less direct power, we've built up this idea of politicians being these super beings from whom all final decisions flow, and I just feel that something's kind of not right. I don't have the solution to it. It's just an observation that I feel it doesn't work.\"</p> <p>In portraying those who govern us as blundering idiots or amoral schemers, he splices the two strongest traditions of political satire on British television. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FRVvjGL2C0\" title=\"\"><em>Yes Minister</em></a> and its sequel <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> depicted politicians as the gulled puppets of wily civil servants. Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn had a great success with that in the 1980s, despite their show being utterly untrue to reality. Margaret Thatcher, the least Jim Hackerish of politicians, was bending the civil service \u2013 and a whole lot else \u2013 to her will.</p> <p>The politician as machinating villain inspired the antihero of Michael Dobbs's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylu3x72WHTs\" title=\"\"><em>House of Cards,</em></a> in which a satanic Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart murdered his way to the premiership. Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran created the Thatcherite grotesque, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKFsEt_3zzk\" title=\"\">Alan B'Stard</a> for Rik Mayall.</p> <p>While consistently excelling at satirising Westminster, British television has failed \u2013 in fact, rarely even attempted\u2013 to dramatise politics as it really is. The Americans had a go with <em>The West Wing</em>. Aaron Sorkin's show was too romantic to be entirely realistic \u2013 \"a liberal wet dream\" of an American presidency, as <em>Wall Street Journal </em>columnist Peggy Noonan described it. Its considerable merit was that it attempted to show politicians and their advisers wrestling with sophisticated policy dilemmas and hard moral choices, sometimes getting it wrong and sometimes right.</p> <p>The Danish political drama, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b019ch5q/episodes/guide\" title=\"\"><em>Borgen</em></a>, recently shown on BBC4, is a classy, gripping and highly textured series that gives an authentic sense of the pressures of running a modern government and how the stress can destroy relationships, even between fundamentally decent people.</p> <p>I ask Iannucci why he thinks British television has not been capable of producing something comparable? Part of the problem, he says, is persuading TV executives to commission anything about politics. \"I remember when I was getting <em>The Thick of It</em> under way. It was a time when if you said 'politics' to them, they'd say, 'No, people aren't interested. Boring. Wouldn't get viewers.'\"</p> <p>He was fortunate: \"I think I was quite lucky because BBC4 was just starting and that was seen as being a bit experimental \u2013 so we could try it. If it didn't work, it didn't work. At least we tried it. And it also meant we didn't have much money, so that affected the style of it, the very fast shooting style.\"</p> <p>He thinks it may also have something to do with Americans having developed a different attitude towards television. \"They just take it more seriously. It used to be film was the art form. I think they realise, as TV screens have got bigger, TV is like a movie experience in the home. So now you can actually do more with television, up the game and do more challenging work. We're just beginning in the UK to think we've been caught napping.\"</p> <p>The next challenge for him is whether there is much more satirical juice to be squeezed out of our political lemons. Fiction now struggles to compete with reality when Boris Johnson makes an arse of himself by getting stuck on a zip wire, Jeremy Hunt almost clouts a bystander with an Olympic bell, the budget unravels over taxes on pasties, David Cameron texts \"lol\" to a tabloid executive without knowing it stands for \"laugh out loud\" and Francis Maude recommends that people prepare for a petrol shortage by filling up their jerry cans. I put it to Iannucci that it is time to swivel his guns on to a fresh target, to go after people who really wield great, global, unaccountable power: bankers, say, or the magnates of social media.</p> <p>This suggestion is greeted with a smile: \"I'm thinking that very thought.\"</p> <p>He goes on to explain: \"Probably this will be the last series of <em>The Thick of It</em>. The door is left open at the end to come back and do specials. But I feel I have explored every crevice now and it's time to take stock and move on. I'm thinking about the power of the internet.\"</p> <p>This sounds like an excellent idea. Who, after all, has the more power: a British cabinet minister or the emperors of Google?</p> <p>\"Exactly,\" he nods. \"Microsoft, Google, Facebook: you have these twentysomethings who have a way into billions of households. It's what we were talking about earlier: where's the power gone? The power is gravitating towards these companies.\"</p> <p>He reveals that he has already done a script for HBO for a show set in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>\"I'm also interested in that personal thing of what it does to you when you're 25 and you're a multibillionaire and everyone in the world knows who you are.\"</p> <p>I'm glad to hear this. It is long past time that the over-revered, under-scrutinised, vastly rich and powerful spiders of the web felt the business end of a sharp satirical stick. I can't think of anyone better to wield it than the brilliant geek from Glasgow.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Did you have any idea how the film would look when you were shooting?</strong></p> <p>Not really, no. I think we all had little pieces of it in our head, but only Joe [Wright, the director,] really knew. If I'm honest, I think he tried to explain it to us, collectively and individually, but no one really knew quite what he was going on about. If I hadn't worked with him before, maybe I would have panicked but I've learned to just trust him over the years and it helps you dive in.</p> <p><strong>It's a huge part for you \u2013 was it what you expected?</strong></p> <p>Hardly. When it was first put forward, we were all going to Russia to shoot it there. I was well up for that, but then the budget came in and it was all too daunting, so we had to hold off. It was on, it was off, it was on again. I think Joe was being scaled back and in fact the new restrictions made him incredibly creative, out of necessity.</p> <p><strong>Did that change the way you approached your performance?</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. Because we weren't going to be doing a naturalistic take on it, I saw it as a kind of juggling act. The set and the way we were flowing from scene to scene meant that we had a very stylised, fluid movement and yet my character's emotional reality had to be as rooted as possible. God, it's hard to explain, partly because I had no idea how it would all turn out. But that's what I was trying to do, to keep hold of a raw, real person at the heart of it, even if her journey was going to be stylised. It was a bloody intense process for me, really hard work.</p> <p><strong>I saw you on set and you were really concentrating. You had your big book of notes, your face was furrowed, you were really thinking your way round each scene that I watched you do.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, well, there are some lucky fuckers who can just turn it on. I'm not one of them, I can tell you. I've never really been a finished product, have I? I mean, I think I've got good instincts about whether I'm making a scene work or not, but because I've had to do all my learning as an actress in public, I've turned into someone who's well prepared. That's just the way I work. It's a bit girly swot, if you want to put it that way, but I need it all written out. I do a lot of homework.</p> <p><strong>Your co-star Aaron Johnson, who plays Count Vronsky, just seemed to be mooching about and then springing into action.</strong></p> <p>See, he's one of those lucky ones. He's just a star and the way he works is so opposite to me. With him, it doesn't look like work but he's so emotionally mature that it kind of allows him to have this relaxed physicality. I thought he was amazing, and he was just about to be a dad for the second time. He was so chilled.</p> <p><strong>Did you research the period and the history as much as you researched Anna emotionally?</strong></p> <p>Yep, all of that. I just have to. If I don't, I get this incredibly crippling stage fright. I've always had it, but I didn't know what it really was until I did my first play on the London stage when I was 24 [in Moli\u00e8re's <em>The Misanthrope</em>]. That's when I suddenly realised what this gnawing fear was. It was stage fright and it was intensified by a live audience being there every night. The only way to fight it was to make sure I knew my lines, my character and my movements so utterly, that I could fall back on them and trust I'd be OK.</p> <p><strong>Jacqueline Durran also did your costumes for <em>Atonement</em>. Did her costumes help on this film?</strong></p> <p>Jacqueline's work seems so sensitive and thought-out. We worked so hard on those, so I'm glad you noticed. It's not just about a nice frock. All Anna's outfits reflect her character in some way, because that's what fashion is and that's what it was to the women of her society.</p> <p><strong>You look good in a fur hat.</strong></p> <p>Thanks, I'm a bit of an old pro in a fur hat, having done <em>Dr Zhivago</em> for telly in 2002. But this was different. Anna wore fur and for me it signified that she was suffocating herself in dead skin, trapping herself, making her own cage.</p> <p><strong>Did you keep any items from the set?</strong></p> <p>No, not one thing. They've all gone back to some vault somewhere to do whatever costumes do after we've worn them. Maybe these will go on tour \u2013 it's a very impressive collection.</p> <p><strong>What are you doing now?</strong></p> <p>I'm shooting on the Lower East Side of New York with Mark Ruffalo \u2013 God, he's lovely \u2013 and Catherine Keener, who is just brilliant, a marvel to watch and learn from, on a film called <em>Can a Song Save Your Life?.</em> It's so, so different to <em>Anna Karenina</em>. We're improvising a lot, which for someone like me, who loves to prepare, is very scary and, yes, I'm singing in it. I know I said I'd never sing again after<em> The Edge of Love,</em> but I've taken the plunge here. It's really good fun, actually.</p> <p><strong>And of course you're marrying into the music business now [having announced her engagement to Klaxons keyboard player James Righton]. </strong></p> <p>Oh, I'm with the band, all right. We haven't got a date for the wedding yet but there's no rush. Truth is, I don't know what I'll be doing at any given time. Technically, after this shoot in New York, I'm unemployed.</p> <p><strong>I think you might be busy doing chatshows on the awards circuit for <em>Anna Karenina</em>, you know. Are you comfortable doing that kind of publicity?</strong></p> <p>I'm not that good at it, really. I just try to be as honest as I can without giving too much away. An actress has to preserve a bit of mystery, you know.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Wright looms out of the shadows of the vast set he's constructed for <em>Anna Karenina</em>. For some reason, as he beams through the darkness, I think of Orson Welles in <em>The Third Man</em>.<em> </em>It then it takes me a moment to realise that he has grown a moustache.</p> <p>\"Do you like what we've done with the place?\" he laughs, gesturing around the dusty-looking, deserted theatre in which I seem to have found myself. Outside, this is Shepperton, but inside, I'm in 19th-century Russia, peering up at a wooden proscenium and peeking behind the wings, from where Joe has just sauntered.</p> <p>For someone in the middle of a tricky and costly British film shoot, he seems remarkably relaxed. That moustache lends him the look of the carnival, but then he's always had something of the ringmaster about him when he works, the centre of his own universe of players and magicians.</p> <p>The words of Wright's producer, Paul Webster, now ring in my ears. I've just come from his office, \u2013 in the David Lean building, no less \u2013 where he has filled me in on the background to this particular, peculiar production of Anna Karenina. \"It's a Joe Wright-ified version that's for sure,\" explained Webster, who also produced the director's award-winning period dramas <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and <em>Atonement</em>. \"But the great thing about working with Joe is that he doesn't lie. You get bang for your buck because he knows he's got to share his vision with everyone and he's so aware of the team aspect of film-making.</p> <p>\"He believes if everyone's a part of it, they will give that bit more \u2013 that's very much the aspect of the theatrical showman about him. He loves to be MCing, front and centre. He does speeches and everything, and he's up before anyone else, at 4.30am, working out his shots, so by the time they all get on set at eight, he's been well into his day for hours. He's the most meticulously prepared person I've met.\"</p> <p>With 83 speaking parts and 100 different sets, this is an enormous movie, requiring a steady hand and clear head in charge, particularly, as I'm about to discover, as no one really knows how it's all going to turn out.</p> <p>Just 12 weeks ago, it wasn't going to be like this. Wright and his team were preparing to film Tom Stoppard's script of Tolstoy's novel in Russia. But wherever they went, scouting locations in St Petersburg, they kept hearing about previous films that had been shot there. The same applied to stately homes in England. \"I was looking for angles, thinking if I shoot from high, it'll look like Russia,\" explains Wright. \"But then the owners would say to me, 'Oh yes, we've had Keira Knightley here twice before', and I began to get this feeling of boredom and despair. I kept thinking there must be another way to make period drama interesting.</p> <p>\"On one despondent afternoon, I harked back to the halcyon days of my shoots on <em>Pride\u2026</em> in the Bennet house, or in the mansion in the first part of <em>Atonement</em>. I remembered how much I loved having everyone around, in one place, with no time wasted journeying. And I just thought, idly, if I could shoot this new one in any one place, where would it be?\"</p> <p>The \"big idea\" he came up with is that it's almost all set in a theatre. One huge, unfolding stage, part doll's house, part ballroom. Characters swoosh from one set to another, smoothly transitioning mood and atmosphere. \"I've always loved the films of Powell and Pressburger,\" Joe tells me. \"They were able to have this heightened sense of dream, yet the drama was always very urgent and real. I always thought Charlie Kaufman's <em>Synecdoche, New York</em> was genius, too, even though I'm not sure I fully understood it. That doesn't matter \u2013 it was a poem. It's OK if something doesn't quite make logical sense. That's what films can do. They're fantasy.\"</p> <p>Wright takes me on a quick tour. There are whole sets in separate rooms, waiting to be wheeled into position. I admit to being confused. I can't see it working. Wright seems impassioned, excited, frankly a bit mad. This could be a disaster, I think to myself, and half-wonder whether I should leave.</p> <p>\"The main theatre has been an ice rink, a horse race, a society ballroom, a train station, a cancan club,\" enthuses Wright. \"Over here's the Vronsky house and through here is the hotel where Anna goes a bit doolally.\"</p> <p>We dash through a door and up some scaffold steps to a set of plush, cobalt-blue rooms. Keira Knightley is deep in thought over a large Filofax-type binder book, her piles of hair tumbling over her white shoulders. Wright goes over to her and has a quiet word then peels off to stand behind a camera that his regular cinematographer, Seamus McGarvey, has been positioning, surrounded by his crew. I linger by a monitor to watch.</p> <p>Knightley takes up her position on a crumpled bed, languorous and dangerous. Anna comes alive, dashing out of the sheets, through some double doors and into an adjoining room. It's one fluid take. \"Bit of a wobbly finish,\" shouts Wright as the camera comes to rest. A chippie comes to batten down a floorboard, and they all go again.</p> <p>It looks good to me. Sure enough, it's in the bag and we move on. Six months later, I see that very same shot on the film's first trailer.</p> <p>I go for a wander, to try to get a feel for the ins and outs of this film. I visit Jacqueline Durran in her giant costume cupboard. The two-time Oscar nominee is surrounded by material and bulky, beaded costumes hang suspended high in the air like ghosts. Her obvious enthusiasm for working with Knightley is evident as she flicks me through the 1950s-couture-inspired sketches for Knightley's 1870s outfits. \"Since she was young, Keira has always understood the importance of costume as part of character,\" she says. \"This is rare in an actress, believe me. She's even got the gumption to turn the costume department's ideas down and comes up with sketches of her own.</p> <p>\"We've loved researching this together, but early on, Joe said he didn't want us constricted by the particular period. As the Russian aristocrats were obsessed with French culture in the 19th century, we just came up with the idea of tweaking it a bit and using the heyday of couture from the 1950s to emphasise Anna's modern streak. Some people will notice, others won't. But it really helped Keira understand Anna, just as 'that' green dress became a signature part of her in <em>Atonement</em>.\"</p> <p>I march past sumptuous soldier jackets and elegant ballgowns, rows of them, like I'm in some frenzied sample sale. Outside, production designer Sarah Greenwood is waiting. This is her seventh collaboration with Wright and she takes me through her designs for this all-encompassing theatre set, based on the Kirov and the Mariinsky in St Petersburg \u2013 and a bit on north London's Alexandra Palace, actually.</p> <p>Like Durran, Greenwood is an equal in the production, both of them integral to Wright's overall idea, both feeding into the whole with an effusive intelligence. She is preparing to go off to Russia, to the Unesco world heritage site of Kizhi island, where it is minus 30 degrees, to shoot some scenes with Domhnall Gleeson's character of Levin, whose protracted yet passionate love story with Kitty provides a thoughtful contrast to Anna's torrid emotional whirl. \"He's the Tolstoy alter ego in the story, really,\" she says. \"Joe sees him as the one true soul, so he gets to go off into reality, to leave the theatrical metaphor. He gets a proper house and fields and everything.\"</p> <p>Downstairs, by the costume department, I bump into Aaron Johnson in shirt and breeches. He looks very relaxed. \"Easy day for me,\" he grins. \"Just got one scene, and I'm asleep for most of it.\" Five minutes later, someone interrupts our chat because his scene is now.</p> <p>I follow him up to that inky set of rooms and take up my position in front of the monitor again. Wright and McGarvey have repositioned and the camera is ready to dolly in on Johnson as he's curled up like a depressed cat in an alcove. These are scenes from the later stages of Anna and Vronsky's affair, when exile has driven them to drugs and indolence. They are, literally, living in the wings of society.</p> <p>As the camera moves in, Johnson stirs, like a startled beast. \"Lovely,\" says Wright. \"One more for luck.\" And they go again, quickly, smoothly but the first one's the keeper. That's two shots in the can already.</p> <p>After I grab lunch with McGarvey on the top of an old double decker bus that stands for a canteen on the Shepperton lot, I knock on Wright's office deep in the studio maze. He's just tucking into a pie and salad and his assistant, Phoebe, brings us coffees. \"Keira's looking good,\" I say. \"She's proper grown-up now,\" smiles Wright. \"She's developed incredibly as an actress and human being and she's really strong now. When we started working on <em>Pride</em> she was 19, a kid. And nothing really bad had happened to her. She'd never really had to ask the bigger questions \u2013 but over the past eight years, she's had to go deep and been challenged and been hurt and all of that makes you stronger. And she's still here. It would have been so easy to bugger off to Hollywood where they're all nice to her. But she dug her heels in and worked really, really hard.\"</p> <p>Why does he enjoy working with her so much and so often? (In between films \u2013 and Wright has always managed to get the best performances out of Knightley \u2013 they've even done commercials for Chanel.) \"I think she's exquisite, I really do,\" he says. \"Lots of directors don't really talk to actors, they're too busy with cameras and stuff. But we did a lovely three weeks rehearsing. That's directing for me, that's what it's all about ultimately, and I'm sure it's what I took with me from having grown up in a puppet theatre.\"</p> <p>Wright's parents founded the Little Angel Theatre in Islington, north London. His mother still runs it and it's where Wright learned everything. Looking at <em>Anna Karenina</em>, one can see the shifting scenery of his childhood puppet world merging with the big-budget movie world more than in any other of his works.</p> <p>\"You could certainly say that,\" he says. \"At this point, I'm worried it might be all a bit camp. It could be the campest film made by a straight man, apart from Baz Luhrmann's films of course. But it is all about artifice and form and I just hope it works.\"</p> <p>That visit to Shepperton has been on my mind a long time. It was a happy set and a big set, though I'm not convinced that back then anyone quite knew how it was all going to come together.</p> <p>But I've seen it all finished now, and it works beautifully. The concept is elegant and exciting, a tragedy unfolding almost as a musical, the flow of images and intimate scenes matching the epic sweep of the novel, swapping literary conceits for theatrical ones, yet somehow remaining incredibly cinematic. Crucially, none of this sleight of hand gets in the way of the story.</p> <p>In fact, the smooth scene changes \u2013 see, I won't even say cuts \u2013 speed up the experience, so it never feels protracted. It is a great doorstop of a novel, distilled into a thrilling love story. And Knightley is superb.</p>",
  "<p>Romy Madley Croft doesn't leave proper fingerprints, and what whorls and ridges the 23-year-old has on the tips of her fingers are so fine they can't be detected by the special machines at US border control. It means that having landed at Los Angeles airport with Oliver Sim and Jamie Smith \u2013 this trio of Londoners forming a remarkable British band, the xx \u2013 Croft is pulled aside for a long and joyless conference with immigration officials. The three musicians, all 23, are groggy after a flight in from Sydney, but only Sim and Smith get to drive away to their hotel.</p> <p>Faint fingerprints. It's a weirdly appropriate impediment for Croft, guitarist and singer in a band such as this. The xx make electronic-edged music that's ghostly, low key, as spare and enigmatic as their curious name. The trio are notoriously reticent, hoping in their promotional commitments to make minimal personal impression; and in the three years between releasing a fine first album and putting out, this month, a second, they've done so impeccably. Tracks from their self-titled debut, winner of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/08/the-xx-mercury-prize-2010\" title=\"\">2010 Mercury Prize</a>, are used all over, and their new album,<em> Coexist</em>, deserves to become another cultural fixture. You will definitely be aware of the xx's stuff. You might not be totally sure who they are, though, these cat burglars of British pop \u2013 here, there and everywhere without leaving identifying marks.</p> <p>In the courtyard of their hotel in Hollywood, the band go unnoticed. They are left alone to blink and wince their way into West Coast time. Beers and coffees are ordered; notes are compared on a wicked, composite jet lag that has built up over close-packed tour dates in Europe, Japan, Australia and now America.</p> <p>Oliver Sim, the band's bass player and co-vocalist, 6ft 2in with a backward whip of hair, is coming to terms with it being the mid-afternoon. At 10am on a Sunday the band's plane left Sydney, spent 13 hours in flight and landed in LA at 7am... still a Sunday. Sim wonders if the experience counts as time travel. Should he have written himself a note? Don't watch the in-flight Jennifer Aniston movie.</p> <p>Jamie Smith, multitasking percussionist and producer, is not so bothered by his extreme tiredness. Being not so bothered is Smith's default position on a great many things. His woolly brown hair shaped into a drooping quiff, he's been sitting poolside all morning, snatching sucks on cigarettes before the waiters can tell him no, and thinking about reworking some incidental music for the band's gig tomorrow. It will be at the <a href=\"http://www.fondatheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Fonda theatre in Hollywood</a>, the xx's first US show in over a year, and a sell-out.</p> <p>Croft, pale-skinned with a distinctive forward swoop of black hair, has by now been freed from the airport to join her bandmates. She had to wait for an hour to get her passport back, she tells me, listening all the while to another passenger being bullied by guards because he wasn't carrying the right form. \"I felt quite upset by it,\" she says. \"I guess \u2026 I guess unnecessariness gets to me.\"</p> <p><em>That</em> is it, the xx's ethos, if it had to be formalised. Unnecessariness gets to them. They don't seem comfortable taking praise, or giving interviews. (\"We're very private,\" Croft tells me. \"We like our personal space.\") They socialise sensibly: karaoke, ideally, and nothing much stronger than Newcastle Brown Ale. They're in their early 20s though are mistakable in manner for people much older, as long as you allow the odd generational giveaway, like Sim's reference to Pok\u00e9mon trading cards, or Croft's habit of making statements with the rising lilt of a question, or the fact that millennial popstar Daniel Bedingfield was a young hero of Smith's. The trio dress in black, always have, and it seems to me symbolic of their aversions. They don't like swank.</p> <p>It should all make their next 48 hours in Los Angeles interesting, because in this most unnecessary of cities, swank is close to a religion. Before the xx depart, Smith will find himself high on a stage in an open-air nightclub, being showered with confetti and enclosed by writhing go-go dancers. A local promoter will give them, of all things, a box of pornography. Croft and Sim will sing while standing on a giant chessboard.</p> <p>LA, acknowledges Sim, is the place that pulls the trio furthest from their comfort zone. Certainly it's a long way from where everything began. Putney.</p> <p><strong>Their first album might have sounded</strong> so spacious, so uncomplicated, because when the band first started writing it they hardly knew their instruments.</p> <p>Sim got a bass on his 14th birthday, by which time Croft was teaching herself the guitar. They'd been friends since before they could talk, near-identical looking toddlers first plonked down to play together in a sandpit. They grew close in that way early-introduced kids do, unquestioningly and by increment, day after day in each other's company. They went to the same primary school then the same secondary, Elliott school in Putney, south-west London.</p> <p>\"Romy knows everything there is to know about me,\" says Sim, but at 14 it took time for them to admit to each other they'd been fiddling with instruments; writing snatches of music; even (behind closed bedroom doors, Sim living with his mum in a Fulham council flat and Croft five minutes' drive away) <em>singing</em>. They decided they'd form a boy-girl duo, and their voices paired brilliantly, hers high and airy against his rich lower register. \"We learned to talk together,\" says Croft. \"I don't know why our voices fit so well, but maybe that's it.\"</p> <p>They performed their first gigs, aged about 16, to a CD drumtrack. Their school had for a while been an incubator of young British bands \u2013 electropop outfit Hot Chip formed there in 2000 \u2013 and pupils tended to be musical. A friend that Croft and Sim had made in the playground, Jamie Smith, started coming to their shows. He was tiny (Croft towered over him) but Smith had from a young age been DJing at local clubs, a great fan of the electronica-tinged hip-hop of RJD2. Sim and Croft asked Smith to improve their drumtrack, and later he joined the band. Inspired by RJD2, Smith decided he'd try to perform the electronic component of the music live, tapping away on a touch-panel MPC sequencer with clawed fingers, playing it like a compact, percussive piano.</p> <p>By 2006, Baria Qureshi, another schoolfriend, had joined as keyboard player and the band had a name, bashed out among a flurry of ideas on a home computer. Were those lower-case letters to represent kisses, chromosomes? Whatever: under the blinking cursor of a Microsoft Word document they liked the way \"the xx\" looked written down. When the quartet left school they were taken on by Caius Pawson, a young music impresario who'd founded a small label, Young Turks. He signed them up and became their manager.</p> <p>Pawson, today, winces at me. We are in a nightclub in north Hollywood where Smith is shortly to do an hour-long DJ set. It's a side project away from the band, billed under his stage name, Jamie xx. \"All the cool little gigs Jamie does for \u00a330,\" Pawson says, pained, \"and I bring the journalist to this one.\" It's an extraordinary occasion. The dancefloor has its own swimming pool. Tins of Stella, here repackaged as a luxury import, are selling for \u00a38. Smith will get his own dancers, and a bouncer. \"Just let me know who I should protect,\" the bouncer keeps saying, and he stars in an ideal moment of farce when Smith moves up to the DJ booth to perform.</p> <p>The set is about halfway through, a confetti bomb going off to mark a high point and the go-go dancers now sharing their podiums with punters brought to a frenzy by Smith's manipulation of Kanye West and Adele. Pawson goes to the bar to get his artist a drink. Don't let anybody into the booth, he instructs the bouncer, who nods. And when Pawson returns the bouncer won't let him in.</p> <p>The next day Smith gives a rare roar of laughter when I tell him this. We are now in a residential tower block, a few streets north, where the xx have been booked to play an afternoon warm-up gig: four quick tracks on a rooftop, their audience made up of competition winners. The block has hosted popstars before, and one of its apartments is today serving as a dressing room. It's here that a war-chest of pornographic DVDs has been left, also condoms, with a note inviting the band to dig in. There are dumbbell weights in the room, should they want to use them.</p> <p>\"Does somebody actually live here?\" asks Sim, staring at a wall-sized mural that says ROCK-A-HOLIC in the style of the Hollywood sign. The LA strangeness is mounting. This morning when the band went on a local radio show there was concern, expressed by the show's production staff, that it would be somehow insensitive to mention the date of their new album's US release, 11 September. (\"Early September\" was the eventual compromise.) Outside, on the tower block's roof, the band have just done a soundcheck and discovered they'll be performing in a part of the building normally reserved for residents' games. Pieces pushed to one side, the xx will gig on a giant chessboard for the first time in their careers.</p> <p>Croft is actually more concerned about a red velvet rope that has been strung between the audience and the performance space. Doesn't it look a bit starry? She and Sim have a muttered discussion, too, about whether they should wear sunglasses for the show. On the one hand, they don't want to look distant. On the other hand \u2013 it's pretty sunny.</p> <p>It makes me think of something Smith told me, another bouncer-related anecdote from the night before. The over-zealous minder had kept smacking off people's hands as they reached out to Smith in his booth. \"I didn't really want to shake their hands,\" conceded Smith. \"But I didn't want them to be knocked away either.\" It's the kind of contradiction the xx are faced with often, as they worry out the kinks and complications of growing renown. They don't like to let people close, but nor do they like being kept, showily, at a distance.</p> <p>Smith offers up another odd moment from last night. In the VIP area after his set he was approached by a figure he recognised. Daniel Bedingfield. \"He gave me a new track he'd made,\" says Smith. Any good, I ask? Smith grimaces, and shakes his head. Oh well: it's a measure of how esteemed he is, anyway, that old heroes seek him out as someone to impress. In the band's time off between records \u2013 most of 2011 \u2013 Smith remixed an Adele single and Gil Scott-Heron's <em>I'm New Here</em> album, both successes, and he's been courted to produce for others since. He mentions a collaboration with a US star which ought to be fascinating if released. The once-admired RJD2 even sent Smith a crate of new music not long ago, possibly looking to work together.</p> <p>Any good, I ask? Smith grimaces, and shakes his head. This is his way, gruff and honest. Should one of my questions misfire (and, boy, do they misfire under this kid's inscrutable stare), Smith stays silent, just letting it pass. In a moment of unusual personal candour, he tells me how he met his Italian girlfriend over drinks in a bar, and adds with a strange sort of pride that <em>he</em> didn't ask her for her phone number. Smith's instinct is for passivity, and perhaps this is what makes him such a fine producer. \"I work with talented people,\" he shrugs. \"I'm just their tool.\"</p> <p>Outside, the rooftop show under way, the xx play through a couple of numbers from their new album and a couple from the old. Afterwards there is an attempt at an onstage radio interview, and Sim hugs himself, embarassed, taking a hit for the team by answering questions on behalf of the others. At one point the interviewer pings a rogue inquiry at Smith, who's hiding among the big chess pieces at the back. Sim has to step in and translate his friend's silent answer, a vague upper-body twitch. \"That means yes,\" says Sim.</p> <p>Afterwards, backstage, the band seem relieved it's over and in a good mood. Tonight's gig at the Fonda theatre will be more demanding but the afternoon set with its small audience has reminded them happily of early gigging days, when they played in pubs and clubs to crowds of a couple of dozen. This was around 2008, when they were working up songs for a possible album and Pawson had installed them in a small rehearsal room in Putney. Womb-like, Sim once called it.</p> <p>They were still living at home at the time, Croft tells me, \"and when I think about it from a parent's perspective we could have been doing <em>anything</em>. You know: we're off to rehearse now, bye! Luckily we were doing something.\" They were perfecting their debut, <em>xx</em>, released in summer 2009 to kick-starting critical acclaim. The band began a tour, which gradually extended as their fanbase grew and eventually lasted about 18 months, on and off. A lot of jet lag and Jennifer Aniston films, plus some emotional times along the way.</p> <p>Difficulties had developed with the band's fourth member, Qureshi. \"She has a place here,\" Sim told the <em>NME</em> at the Mercury announcement ceremony in 2010. \"She's part of the album.\" But Qureshi was no longer part of the band, ejected in October 2009 after a particularly trying few days at a New York music festival. \"There were problems that came to light because we were at such close quarters,\" Sim tells me. Croft, at the time, likened the rift to a divorce.</p> <p>They had to grow up in a lot of ways during that first tour. Most of us go through the buffeting half-romances of early adulthood with a bedroom to retreat to, a duvet to crawl under, but the xx went through it all in minivans and departure lounges \u2013 with an entourage. Smith tells me about a DJ set he was doing, somewhere on the tour, when a girl in the crowd approached him with a folded-up note. He was young, and had no clue what to do with it, so he put it in his pocket. Only after much jokey persuasion from those around him did he finally open it, in the cab on the way back to the band's hotel. It might not be too late to follow it up... The note said: \"Why don't you play some decent music?\"</p> <p>For Croft and Sim there was a more brutal lesson. \"The first piece <em>Dazed</em> [<em>&amp; Confused</em> magazine] did on us,\" Croft once explained, \"they outed us in the first line.\" Ever since, the pair have not spoken with ease, if at all, about their sexuality. Softening, in 2010, Croft gave a short, intimate interview to the online magazine <em>Tourist</em> in which she and her girlfriend at the time, an art student based in London, talked about love. What does it feel like, they were asked, to be in a long-distance relationship? \"Like when you're eight,\" the rather beautiful answer, \"and you want it to be your birthday.\"</p> <p>Sim has kept consistently zipped. \"Is there anything you want to say to your gay fans?\" he was once asked by New Gay TV, and seeming to think about it, Sim replied: \"Hot Chip are amazing.\" The xx sing almost exclusively about matters of the heart (Missing, a track on <em>Coexist</em>, might be the most aching lament on romantic separation I've heard) but their love-lives away from the mic have never been very clearly outlined. I get the sense, speaking to Sim, that he quite enjoys the mystery he inspires. On stage he sways and leers, all eyes and attitude. Exactly as a good frontman should, he makes you \u2013 bloke in the crowd, neck craned \u2013 feel many degrees less masculine because you haven't got a guitar and a catalogue of tortured love songs to growl through. Offstage this persona vanishes and he is bouncier, camper, \"more smiley than people would think\". His speech is peppered with assertive, accented \"yeah\"s, almost used as punctuating stops. It's something I've noticed rappers do, a statement of sureness and muscularity. Sim, chatting to me after the rooftop set, does it with a flower tucked behind his ear.</p> <p>Does he thrive on the ambiguity that surrounds him? \"It's kind of a double thing,\" he says. \"I enjoy not knowing everything about a musician <em>I</em> like. At a time when you can find out a popstar's favourite animal, I think it's more exciting not to know.\" Part two, he says, is simpler: \"I just don't want to tell everyone everything. If you took anyone off the street and asked them to share as much as we get asked to share, they'd say no. I don't think that's abnormal.\" He finds it abnormal, actually, that other bands agree to share so much.</p> <p>Croft has come to be more open. She is in a long-term relationship with fashion designer Hannah Marshall, and this week has arranged for her girlfriend to join the band in LA. When I meet her, Marshall is a bright, quick-smiling 30-year-old with unusual sheared hair. While the band prepare to leave the tower block for the Fonda theatre, she makes herself useful, steaming the creases out of a top for Croft to wear, keeping everyone's spirits up with chat.</p> <p>Having somebody special along for a show, Croft tells me privately, \"makes it new\". Like the cheesy bit in a rock movie, I suggest, when the singer sees someone significant in the crowd and does it <em>just for them</em>. \"Yeah, always,\" she says, smiling. \"If someone's there that means something to me, it's all I can think about on stage \u2013 that person.\"</p> <p>We are talking, alone, on a balcony jutting off the tower. In front of us are the Hollywood hills, the iconic sign looking haggard and sad. Behind us is the freeway, the 101, enduring LA's frightening evening rush hour. Croft's voice is almost lost to the noise of traffic as she talks about her father, who died in early 2010 during the band's first tour. The xx were in Paris when they heard, and rushed back to London. After that, says Croft, \"everything kind of went on pause\". Gigs were cancelled. Everyone waited on Croft. \"And then there was a point where I was asked: 'What do you want to do?'\"</p> <p>What she tells me next surprises me, because I've skimmed through thousands of words on the xx by now, and I've read their back-stories many times. The band volunteer so little about themselves, though, there are inevitable gaps, and significant ones. Croft tells me she had lost a parent before. \"My mum died when I was 11,\" she says. \"And I felt quite sad about myself feeling this way, but [when my dad died] it wasn't a <em>new</em> feeling. It was something that I was familiar with.\"</p> <p>So Croft returned to work quicker than even she can believe, looking back. Within days of the bereavement the band were playing a planned show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. \"My dad was always there, carrying my amps, driving me around, and I knew that he would have wanted us to carry on.\" After Shepherd's Bush, the xx recommenced their tour.</p> <p>Has she written about this stuff? \"A couple of songs,\" says Croft, \"but just for myself. My dad was such a fan of music, I'd love to write something in tribute to him.\" Thinking about it, she adds: \"Though maybe it's somewhere that would be quite difficult to go, every night on stage.\"</p> <p>Separately, both Croft and Sim speak about the depersonalising effect of having a calendar that maps out, day by day, show by show, a great chunk of the near future. It's another unsettling form of time travel, and \"an awful thing\", says Sim, \"to see on a screen in front of you\". It might be why they've tried to scatter this new tour with plans, targets. They'll soon play an arena in Antwerp, to test their intimate sound on a bigger stage. On his own, Sim has written a song, not right for the band, that he hopes Beyonc\u00e9 might consider if he can work up the courage to ask. Smith has plans to build a new instrument, like his beloved MPC sequencer but iPad-like and see-through, colourful graphics conjured with the same finger taps that make his music.</p> <p>Croft, I sense, simply aims for a less lurching tour than the last. \"Right now I can see what I'm doing until next year,\" she says (and from LA the band will fly to Seattle then through Canada and on to New York, eventually to the UK and Mexico and back to the US), \"and during that time there's no room for disasters, or life, or anything else like that to happen\".</p> <p>Awful, in a way. And in a way, I'm sure, a relief.</p> <p><strong>At the Fonda theatre, later,</strong> the band perform, and I try to look out for Croft looking out for her girlfriend. I want to glimpse the singer as she pares down a capacity crowd to one. But I'm a distance away, and there's a lot of stage smoke, and anyway the show's too absorbing to maintain professional scrutiny for long. Soon I'm listing and hollering with everyone else. Nodding, too \u2013 people do a lot of nodding at the xx gigs. Group confirmation: oh this <em>is</em> good.</p> <p>But an LA crowd will demand its swank, and bands playing the Fonda tend to put a little extra zing into their shows. When rapper Azealia Banks performed here, she did so dressed as a pink mermaid, finally lost to view under an industrial dump of balloons from the eaves. Before that, Kasabian in town, their frontman did muscle poses before strolling into the crowd.</p> <p>The xx don't do this, nor shower the Fonda with balloons. Yet the production of tonight's show is unprecedentedly ambitious. The trio perform in front of magnificent new laser lights, tinged pink and gold, that shoot out from the rear of the stage. They play most of the show backlit, and it's almost a shame the band can't see themselves as the audience do, framed by these powerful lights. I'm certain they'd approve, because Croft and Sim and Smith are left shadowy, indistinct, really only silhouettes.</p> <p><em>Coexist is out on 10 September. The xx play Bestival on 8 September </em></p>",
  "<p>One of the saddest things in the gaming world is seeing a title that's clearly trying to do something special and yet ends up barely mediocre. Such is the case for <em>Damage Inc</em>, a second world war-set aerial shooter from new developer Trickstar Games. Despite promising \"beautifully rendered aircraft, islands and battle scenes\", the visuals fail to impress, mostly involving bland landscapes with little or no detail, while inter-mission sections look like PowerPoint presentations. Luckily, flight itself is enjoyable, and with around 30 jets to unlock, there's plenty of variety in terms of aircraft.</p> <p>However, <em>Damage Inc</em> exists almost exclusively to partner the AV8R flight stick included with the collector's edition of the game. That in itself may make <em>Damage Inc</em> a worthwhile purchase, as it's a sturdy bit of kit that enables precise control of your jets \u2013 barrel rolls, loops and more are intuitively pulled off, and combat comes alive far more when using it. Arcade controls make shoot-outs accessible for casual players, while simulation controls add a ring of authenticity. Flight-sim fanatics will favour more comprehensive rigs, but given that the AV8R is designed to mimic 60-year-old planes, it's certainly fit for purpose.</p>",

  "<p>Channel 4 has said that viewing figures for its Paralympic coverage are exceeding expectations and rejected claims that it is not showing enough live coverage. The broadcaster paid around \u00a39m to win the rights to an event and is devoting more than 150 hours of coverage on its main channel. It said that its coverage of the first night of athletics peaked at 3.6 million on Friday evening.</p> <p>That was the night Hannah Cockroft won Britain's first gold in the main stadium and made Channel 4 the most watched channel at 9pm, with 2.9m watching BBC1 and 2.6m watching the Uefa Super Cup on ITV1. Coverage of the opening ceremony peaked at more than 11 million, its biggest audience in a decade.</p> <p>A Channel 4 spokesman rejected claims that the broadcaster had spent too long chatting with guests in the studio and not enough showing live coverage. He said more time was devoted to explaining the sports and classification system over the first couple of days and pointed out that Channel 4 also had three live streams continuously running on its interactive channels. Including the interactive channels, it is devoting an unprecedented 500 hours of coverage to the Paralympics. In 2008, the BBC showed nightly highlights on BBC2, together with some live programming at the weekends and on its interactive service.</p> <p>Channel 4 insiders claim criticism that they have not shown enough live sport is unfair. They cleared the schedules on Thursday and Friday, moving a planned afternoon block of programming including <em>Deal or No Deal</em> and <em>Come Dine With Me</em> to More4, to ensure wall to wall coverage.</p> <p>Some viewers complained that Britain's opening wheelchair basketball match, a narrow defeat to Germany in overtime, was not shown live. Nor was Ellie Simmonds' heat on Saturday morning, in which she recorded a personal best and narrowly missed the world record. But Channel 4 pointed out that given the volume of events taking place at the same time, there were times when it would have to make editorial choices between sports on its main channel. It also has to contend with the Olympic Broadcast Service, contracted by the Games organisers to provide coverage, not having cameras at all events. Channel 4 will have to send its own news cameras to the shooting, rowing and marathon but will not be able to provide live coverage.</p> <p>The broadcaster has staked much on the Paralympics, hoping it will help redefine its image while breaking even commercially. It spent \u00a3500,000 on a talent search to recruit a team of new disabled presenters, who have been paired with established broadcasters including Clare Balding and Jonathan Edwards.</p> <p>It is particularly pleased that ratings appear to be holding up throughout the day, with 800,000 viewers staying tuned for <em>The Last Leg</em>, a round-up show with the Australian comedian Adam Hills, after 11pm on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>One day in the future, perhaps, an England manager will be able to name an England squad without the static interference of John Terry's latest predicament providing low-level background noise, but that day is still some way off.</p> <p>Terry has been stripped of the England captaincy, is now facing only an FA inquiry into his behaviour towards Anton Ferdinand a year ago instead of a court of law and, for unrelated reasons, is serving a European ban at club level. To say controversy has dogged the Chelsea captain's career would be to understate the case by the length of the Kings Road, yet like his Italian predecessor, who eventually resigned over his attachment to Terry, Roy Hodgson wants him in his team whatever the complications.</p> <p>\"I choose him as a player, I don't know what public criticism you are referring to,\" was Hodgson's defiant, almost Nelsonian response to suggestions that he might have left Terry out until the FA have completed their investigations. \"Some people are criticising him, some are championing him,\" he adds, indicating he owns a highly selective ear rather than a deaf one. \"I have no interest in that debate whatsoever. I am told I can pick the team I want to pick and John Terry is available to be selected. The other aspect of things will take its course and has no influence at all in my thinking.\"</p> <p>That was more or less Fabio Capello's position too, until the FA overruled him in regard to his choice of captain, but though Hodgson seems to be taking a similarly hardline stance he is probably calculating that now the principle of Terry being allowed to represent England while defending his character has been established he is on safe ground in continuing to select him as a team member. Hodgson is a much more pragmatic, diplomatic individual than Capello, and has already begun to dismantle some of the ground rules the Italian set in stone.</p> <p>Under Capello, for instance, no player could expect to be called up for England if he was not playing regularly for his club. \"It is impossible,\" Capello would say, and he made very few exceptions. Hodgson, on surveying the amount of English talent the Premier League has to offer, believes it may have to be made possible. \"I'm not prepared to have a hard and fast rule, I intend to be more pragmatic than that,\" he says, after naming lightly used players such as Daniel Sturridge, Ryan Bertrand and Andy Carroll in his squad for the games against Moldova and Ukraine, though the last of these has now had to withdraw after picking up a hamstring injury on his debut for West Ham on Saturday.</p> <p>\"It goes without saying that I would prefer to be picking from a list of players who are regulars at club level, but if I want to use youngsters such as Sturridge or Danny Welbeck, to blood them and bring them through, then I might just have to accept that they won't be appearing every week for their clubs.</p> <p>\"What we have in this country at the moment is a number of promising English 21-year-olds at top clubs competing with players who are world stars. I don't think it would be right to overlook them just because most weeks their club coach prefers Fernando Torres, Sergio Ag\u00fcero or Robin van Persie.\"</p> <p>Carroll has moved from Liverpool to West Ham on loan, ostensibly a backward step though one that at least should mean that when fit he is used more regularly so that his form and effectiveness can be more readily assessed. \"Andy might have played more often had he stayed at Newcastle, but he made a move to a bigger club and I have to accept that,\" Hodgson says. \"It's what players generally do, but the big clubs in this country have very strong squads and it is not always easy to break into the team. The same thing used to happen with Sweden, where the best players would go abroad, but not necessarily find themselves playing every week in Italy or Germany.</p> <p>\"It's not something I'm happy about, but you have to do your best to give young players the necessary experience because you could be relying on them in the future. Ryan Bertrand is a good example. Everyone else is fit so we could have left him out, we have good cover on the left. But we were keen to have him with us because maybe in a couple of years he will be playing a bigger part.\"</p> <p>Tickets are still available for the Ukraine game at Wembley on 11 September, by which time Hodgson hopes to have points in the bag ahead of the home fixture against San Marino the following month and the slightly trickier trip to Poland. Based on England's world ranking and the performances of Poland and Ukraine at Euro 2012, Hodgson cannot claim to be in a difficult group, recent struggles against Montenegro notwithstanding.</p> <p>History suggests qualification is not the problem, however, it is the tournaments where England often fall apart, and Hodgson is prudently trying to steer a path between not taking anything for granted in the early stages and not being too daunted by the fact that no European team has ever won a World Cup in South America. \"Playing on your own continent is a major advantage, but I think most people would agree Spain are currently playing football that would compare with the Brazil teams of the past, so maybe the gap is getting smaller,\" he says.</p> <p>\"As for England, we are at the start of a campaign, and that's always exciting. People might say we can't win this World Cup, but we can certainly start out believing we can win. To win the World Cup you have to be a very good team, but first you have to get there. Then it depends on whether you are good enough. But while we can believe, let's believe. We'll be ready to give it a good shot.\"</p> <h2>England's road to the World Cup</h2> <p>7 Sept <strong>Moldova v England </strong></p> <p>11 Sept <strong>England v Ukraine</strong></p> <p>12 Oct <strong>England v San Marino</strong></p> <p>16 Oct <strong>Poland v England</strong></p> <p>14 Nov Sweden v England*</p> <p>22 Mar 2013 <strong>San Marino v England</strong></p> <p>26 Mar <strong>Montenegro v England</strong></p> <p>14 Aug England v Scotland *</p> <p>6 Sept <strong>England v Moldova</strong></p> <p>10 Sept <strong>Ukraine v England</strong></p> <p>11 Oct <strong>England v Montenegro</strong></p> <p>15 Oct <strong>England v Poland</strong></p> <p>*Friendly international</p>",
  "<p>When the rookie dressage rider Natasha Baker saw the Paralympic star Lee Pearson win three golds at Sydney 2000 she turned to her mother and declared that she too would take part in a Paralympics \u2013 and win gold.</p> <p>And while she made good on that promiseon Saturday, becoming the Paralympic champion at Greenwich Park in her grade in the individual championship test, the man who inspired her had to settle for silver.</p> <p>Pearson, the veteran of the British para-equestrian team, had previously been unbeaten in his Paralympic career, taking three golds at each of the Games in Athens, Sydney and Beijing. But despite a compelling performance packed with energy, his score of 75.391 was beaten by Australia's Joann Formosa who scored 75.826.</p> <p>Baker, a rookie in a British team who have dominated dressage for decades \u2013 winning every team gold medal since 1996 at Paralympic, world and European level \u2013 put in an astonishingly assured performance. \"I've been dreaming about this for 12 years,\" she said. \"And now I'm going to have my own golden postbox and stamp!\"</p> <p>The 22-year-old made it look easy, no small achievement for a rider who cannot control her horse using her legs, after a virus damaged her spine when she was 14 months old. \"It is hard particularly when you haven't got any use of your legs whatsoever,\" she said. \"You have to overcome that and I have trained all my horses to listen to my voice and my seat.\"</p> <p>Against the gasp-inducing skyline of Greenwich \u2013 its Royal Observatory and Queen's House punctuated by the brash mass of Canary Wharf \u2013 the audience watched with reverence as both riders put in poised performances.</p> <p>Not everybody at Greenwich may have understood the significance of a \"half circle\", or the difficulty of a \"turn on the haunches\", but they could appreciate the graceful harmony both riders achieved with their powerful horses beneath them, their strength contained with the grace and elegance of ballet dancers. And with the respect and restraint demanded by the announcer, they duly waved their approval at the riders in each category \u2013 grade II and Ib \u2013 until they were able to clap after each horse had left the competition arena.</p> <p>Baker gave a seemingly effortless ride on her horse Cabral, in her grade II category. The newcomer \u2013 as excitable outside the arena as calm within it \u2013 scored 76.857%. A tense morning followed, with two German competitors coming close to her score but she saw off strong competition from her friend, Germany's star-rider Britta Napel who took silver with 76.048% on her horse Aquilina 3. Angelika Trabert, also from Germany, made it three women on the podium, scoring 76.000% on Ariva-Avanti.</p> <p>After taking gold Baker paid homage to Pearson and the rest of the Paralympic equestrian team. She credited him and fellow veteran Deb Criddle with firing her ambition to become a Paralympic champion.</p> <p>\"When I saw the harmony with horse and rider it was just stunning,\" she said, her gold medal hanging around her neck. \"I announced to my mum that I was going to the Paralympic Games and I was going to win gold \u2013 and it's been my dream ever since.\"</p> <p>Baker, who refers to herself as her horse's \"mother\" and was moved to tears when talking of her pride in her horse, explained they shared a relationship of total trust. \"Every time he is like 'Oh mum, I'm not a 100% sure', I just give him a pat and he just relaxes,\" she said. \"To have that power over him, he's just so genuine and he really does listen to everything I ask of him, he is amazing.\"</p> <p>Despite failing to take his 10th consecutive gold, Pearson left the competition area relieved and grateful for a strong performance, having been disappointed with a less than perfect display in the team test on Friday, despite coming in pole position in the points table.</p> <p>\"I'm really happy, it's been a tough competition, it's been a tough year,\" he said. \"Gentleman is quite a tough horse to get in the perfect frame of mind, so I'm over-the-moon to have medalled.\"</p> <p>He added that after Baker's win he texted her the message: \"Well done baby star,\" to which she cheekily replied: \"Thanks OAP star.\"</p> <p>Formosa took gold in her first Paralympics after fund raising to get herself and her 16-year-old horse to London. Formosa, who has spinal cord and nerve damage after a riding accident, took the more seasoned British dressage fans by surprise. They had expected the biggest threat to come from Austria's Pepo Puch.</p> <p>An exhilarated Formosa said she had come to the competition to win. \"When I'm out there, there is nothing wrong with me, I'm free,\" she said. \"I may not be able to walk very well but when I'm on a horse I'm a different person.\" Puch, who competed in the three-day eventing Olympics at Athens only to suffer a spinal cord injury after being thrown from a horse in 2008, finished in bronze position with 75.043</p> <p>Pearson is notoriously nervous before events, to the extent that he is kept away from his horse until right before a competition to avoid spooking the animal. He spent the morning wandering around the Olympic Park on his electric chair, chatting to fans for distraction. \"It was the most nervous I have been in my entire life,\" said the 38-year-old, who has an unbeaten run in each of his three events in Athens, Sydney and Beijing.</p> <p>Both riders will now look to the individual freestyle \u2013 in which their riders choreograph their own routines to music \u2013 on Monday. Baker is looking for her second gold, while Pearson will be aiming for his 10th. He can no longer pass Tanni Grey-Thompson's 11 golds at this Games \u2013 but he could perhaps match her with the freestyle and result of the team event still to go. \"We can show a bit more pizazz and show a bit more of mine and Gent's personality, do a bit more than the compulsory movements and show off a little bit,\" he said.</p> <p>Pearson, whose silver medal got the biggest cheer of the afternoon, may not have taken the top prize but spoke of other victories that had been achieved in this Paralympics.</p> <p>\"I am just so proud of Britain, to get the crowds we have got at all of the venues and a sell out with the tickets is phenomenal,\" he said. Having bronze busts made of him, and documentaries made about him was \"all lovely and fluffy\", he said, but added that the real victory of these Games was the increased visibility of disabled sports and athletes. \"Public perception has changed and we are household names now,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>So far there has been only a few short clips released of the new fly on the wall documentary series about Liverpool but it is enough to confirm the impression of Brendan Rodgers as a man of presence and force of personality.</p> <p>Rodgers can be seen addressing his players on the club's pre-season visit to the United States and telling the younger ones, to put it bluntly, that their attitude needs to improve. He makes his point slowly and very matter-of-factly. No shouting or flying off the handle. No swearing, just the clear sense that this is a manager who does not tolerate imperfections and delivered in a way that commands attention.</p> <p>Halfway through, Rodgers juts out a finger at Raheem Sterling and the player suddenly looks what he is: a 17-year-old in a man's world. Sterling has said something that Rodgers does not like. \"You say 'steady' again when I say something to you,\" Rodgers informs him, \"you'll be on the first plane back.\" Sterling tries to deny it and Rodgers cuts him dead. There is going to be only one winner in this debate.</p> <p>The whole thing lasts barely a minute but it is enough to tell you that <em>Being Liverpool</em> should be compelling viewing when Fox Soccer begins the six-part series on 16 September, with Channel 5 holding the UK rights. After that, the plan is for a <em>Being Manchester City</em> series, followed by <em>Being Chelsea</em>. Both clubs, this column has been told, are receptive to the idea and if it takes off \u2013 to be specific, if it does well in the USA \u2013 the hope is Manchester United could be tempted further down the line.</p> <p>It is all about cracking America, though given the history of these documentaries it is not altogether clear whether it is a good idea, and probably won't be until the credits roll on the final episode.</p> <p>Football fly on the walls have a habit of leaving their subject with burned fingers, or in some cases their entire arms on fire, and there has to be a risk attached when the official blurb talks of \"unprecedented access,\" with cameras allowed on \"the training fields, in the gyms, changing rooms and boardrooms, at team meetings and at home\". All of which equates to good television, yes. Just not necessarily good sense, if we are going by the lesson of history.</p> <p>HBO has a similar series, <em>Hard Knocks</em>, that has been going behind the scenes, warts and all, in the NFL since 2001. This year it is the Miami Dolphins who put themselves forward, which probably seemed like a good idea at the time. Except Miami have come across as a rabble and, watching it all unfold, it is clear why most teams wouldn't touch the show with a bargepole these days.</p> <p>One scene recently was of three senior players turning up at the coach Joe Philbin's office to complain that he was not communicating enough with them. Then, three weeks ago, the wide receiver Chad Johnson was arrested for allegedly butting his wife, Evelyn Lozada. They had been married a grand total of 41 days and the police report says their row began with her finding a receipt for condoms in his car. Johnson is now facing a domestic battery charge and <em>Hard Knocks</em> was there when he reported to work the day after getting bail. It is compelling viewing, as car\u2011crash television so often is, culminating in Philbin sitting him down to break the news during a long and emotive conversation that he is being cut.</p> <p>Nothing quite so sensational at Anfield, where they have at least had the sense to realise that a lot of things go on behind the scenes at football clubs that they would not want on television. One of the smartest moves Liverpool's owners, principally John W Henry, have made this summer is revamping the club's PR department in the wake of the Luis Su\u00e1rez affair.</p> <p>The new regime is switched on enough to realise the dangers of these kind of shows and understand the importance of editorial control. So don't tune in expecting to see, close-up, the sacking of Kenny Dalglish, or hear the club's least productive signings being derided in the boardroom.</p> <p>All the same, the filming does take in the end of the Dalglish era, an FA Cup final defeat and what is essentially a difficult changeover period.</p> <p>Liverpool's way has always been to try to keep everything in-house and if there are supporters who feel a little uneasy about what to expect, or followers of Chelsea and Manchester City who would rather their clubs don't go down this line, they only have to look back to last season \u2013 the Su\u00e1rez issues, the mutiny against Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas plus assorted Carlos Tevez and John Terry controversies \u2013 to realise the potential for embarrassment.</p> <p>Leyton Orient tried something similar in the 1994-95 season and, even now, it still makes for gruesome viewing. The low point of <em>Club for a Fiver</em> comes at half-time of one game against Blackpool when the joint manager, John Sitton, is filmed sacking the crowd favourite, Terry Howard, before offering \"a right fucking sort-out\" to two other players. \"And you can pair up if you like,\" Sitton kindly offers, \"and you can fucking pick someone else to help you, and you can bring your fucking dinner. Cos by the time I've finished with you, you'll fucking need it.\"</p> <p>Sitton might fit nicely into a Guy Ritchie film but he has not worked in professional football since, despite sending off 60-odd job applications. The last anyone heard of him he was a black-cab driver. Sitton, in a letter to the <em>Leyton Orientear</em> fanzine, blamed a documentary \"that at best can only be described as sensationalist and, at worst, totally inaccurate and unbalanced\". The film-makers, he complained, had ignored the run-of-the-mill stuff to focus on the \"four or five times\" he lost his rag.</p> <p>Well, yes, that's the point. Scott Boggins, the executive producer of the Liverpool series, didn't win his Emmy awards in his previous venture, the 24/7 boxing documentaries on HBO, by ignoring all the juicy stuff.</p> <p>Likewise, the heavy editing of <em>The Four Year Plan</em> wasn't enough to spare QPR's embarrassment when it was shown on BBC2 in May, including one brilliant moment when Flavio Briatore threatened to sell the club unless someone delivered him the names of every single fan who had been singing rude songs about him.</p> <p>These things rarely end well and, though we lap it up at home, the clubs are always taking a calculated gamble when they sign up. Liverpool, with careful guidance, might manage to get through the series without any major casualties but the nature of these things suggests that is not necessarily what the documentary-makers want.</p> <p>As for the proposed next series, City have to ask themselves the same kind of questions that Liverpool have just ticked off. Does the good outweigh the bad and who has the final say in what goes out? For now, there are probably only two certainties. The first is that Sterling will think twice about back-chatting his manager in the future. The second is that an access-all-areas documentary with Mario Balotelli at its epicentre would probably be worth the licence fee on its own.</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers acting for Tony Nicklinson, the man with locked-in syndrome who died after losing a legal bid to end his life, claim that unaired legal arguments in his unsuccessful battle can be revived should another claimant come forward seeking to pursue his case.</p> <p>Such a move would mean that volumes of evidence collected by Nicklinson's legal team, addressing key issues in the right-to-die debate that were not heard during his case, could still end up being presented in the supreme court.</p> <p>It would allow Nicklinson's lawyers to publicly confront the arguments against a change in the law in the highest court in the land, which could provide a pivotal moment in the right-to-die debate.</p> <p>\"In a civilised society nobody should have to suffer in the way Tony did,\" Nicklinson's wife, Jane, told the <em>Observer</em> on Thursday, the day before her husband's funeral. In a direct appeal to MPs not to duck the issue, she said: \"Look at all of the support we have from the public, does this count for nothing? Imagine it were you, how would you feel? Tony showed the world what locked-in syndrome is like. Can you imagine spending the rest of your life like that?\"</p> <p>Nicklinson, who died aged 58, was a keen sportsman until he was paralysed by a stroke in 2005. He lost a landmark right-to-die action at the high court last month and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/22/tony-nicklinson-dies-right-to-die\" title=\"\">died at home after contracting pneumonia</a>, having refused food. His family said he had been devastated by the ruling. Nicklinson argued that the law should be changed so that a doctor who helped him end his life when he chose could plead a defence of necessity to a charge of murder.</p> <p>But the court said that \"changes involving matters of controversial social policy\" were for parliament and rejected Nicklinson's claim after a two-day hearing, which his legal team said was not enough time to examine the complexities of the issues.</p> <p>\"There is strong public interest in this issue being pursued and considered by the highest court in the country \u2013 the supreme court,\" said Nicklinson's solicitor, Saimo Chahal, of the law firm Bindmans.</p> <p>\"What happened to Tony could happen to anyone. Everyone can understand the situation and see that respect for autonomy and self-determination are important issues for society,\" Chahal said. \"The support for Tony has been overwhelming and the public would wish to see the issue considered fully and properly by the supreme court. It would be a great shame for the issue to be left unresolved in this way.\"</p> <p>Jane Nicklinson said she would \"support 100% anyone who is willing to take the case forward. I hope that Tony's contribution can help, and I am happy for anything he has said to be used to further the case. At the very least he has left a legacy.\"</p> <p>Nicklinson's lawyers have drawn parallels with a recent case in Canada that they cited in their legal arguments as a \"relevant and a persuasive authority\". Although the UK courts are under no legal duty to recognise the Canada case, it is likely to influence the UK debate as supporters continue their campaign for a change in the law</p> <p>\"That court heard evidence over 20 days; ours was over two days,\" Chahal said. \"The Canadian court produced a highly reasoned judgment running to nearly 400 pages that dealt with all of the concerns raised, including about the potential impact on vulnerable people.\"</p> <p>The Canadian court ruled that the criminal law was unfair and discriminatory and ordered parliament to amend it. It agreed that one of the applicants should be allowed the right to have a death assisted by a doctor.</p> <p>In the Nicklinson case, a key concern of the high court was the impact any change in the law would have on vulnerable people. Anti-euthanasia campaigners claim a change would place people with disabilities, who fear being a burden on others, under greater pressure to end their lives. But arguments against this crucial claim, drawn up by Nicklinson's lawyers, were not scrutinised in court.</p> <p>\"None of the evidence in our case was challenged by the defendant and the only focus of the arguments was that the courts should leave this subject to parliament, as it was too difficult and controversial,\" Chahal said.</p> <p>She said she was not aware of any person who could make a suitable claimant but hoped that someone would \"wish to raise these issues and take forward the appeal\".</p> <p>Jane Nicklinson said: \"In the countries where assisted suicide or legalised euthanasia exists, there is no substantiated evidence of abuse and there are rigorous systems in place to make sure that the schemes work properly. What was proposed in Tony's case would mean that each time someone wanted to die with assistance, the court would have to consider the evidence and decide as they do in cases involving the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration.\"</p>",
  "<p>Manchester City did not need Fergie time to win this one, though they were far from convincing against a Queens Park Rangers side still getting to know each other. Lacking their sharpest two strikers they struggled to turn a wealth of possession into a commanding lead until Carlos Tevez struck in stoppage time to give the scoreline a flattering gloss.</p> <p>The defending champions have yet to keep a clean sheet this season and, though they answered back smartly enough when QPR roused themselves to make a game of it in the second half, there were more defensive aberrations than Roberto Mancini has been used to. \"It is important that we improve because we cannot concede a goal in every match,\" the City manager said. \"We played well in the first half but our big problem is that we are not taking our chances.\"</p> <p>City survived an early scare when Joe Hart had to backpedal to prevent Jack Rodwell claiming the own goal of the season, but that apart the much-altered QPR were unrecognisable in the first half as the enterprising side who gave the Etihad such palpitations in May. City were ahead after 16 minutes and it was an indication of how one-sided the action was that they scored from their sixth corner. David Silva sent over a deep cross from the right, and though Tevez's far-post volley did not quite come off the rebound off Bobby Zamora was tucked away by Yaya Tour\u00e9.</p> <p>City enjoyed a near monopoly of possession for the rest of the first half but failed to do an awful lot with it. Without Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Mario Balotelli, the latter on the bench before an operation to correct his eyesight in Italy next week, City lacked a certain sparkle up front, where Edin Dzeko's first touch let him down on a couple of occasions. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was present to check out City in advance of their Champions League meeting with Real Madrid later this month and, while there is a possibility Mancini will still be without his two first-choice forwards when the first game comes around at the Bernab\u00e9u, the club are confident Balotelli's laser surgery is a minor enough procedure for him to return straight after the international break.</p> <p>City opened the second half on the offensive, with Robert Green stopping a shot from Tevez and Pablo Zabaleta hitting the bar after being sent in on goal through one of the passes of the afternoon from Silva. Zamora managed his first attempt on goal just before the hour but could not keep his header down, so when he came up with an equaliser just seconds later it counted as something of a surprise. Perhaps the greatest surprise was that Silva was to blame for losing the ball in his own half, allowing Andy Johnson to advance to the edge of the penalty area, and, though Hart produced a marvellous save to keep out a stinging shot that took a slight deflection, he ended up on the floor and was powerless to prevent Zamora nodding the loose ball over the line.</p> <p>If that seemed to suggest another tense finish may be on the cards for City after all, on this occasion Rangers held their lead for only two minutes. Tevez did well to seize on Aleksandar Kolarov's cross from the left and turn it into something more threatening with a single touch, and when he put the ball back across the face of goal Dzeko was in an ideal position to score with a straightforward header.</p> <p>Dzeko was in an ideal position to put the match beyond reach a few minutes later, presented with the ball at his feet by another impeccable pass from Silva, yet with only Green to beat he contrived to miss the target. Dzeko's next big chance came right at the death, and again he mis\u2013hit, though at least he hit his shot right at Tevez, who stuck out a slightly lucky leg to divert it past Green.</p> <p>\"I don't think we deserved that third goal but I was pleased with the shift we put in in the second half,\" Mark Hughes said. \"We imposed ourselves on a very good team, and we can only get better once the new guys bed in.\"</p>",

Rarely has body art seemed more prescient.</p> <p>The 36-year-old, who lost a legal fight to be allowed to run in the Paralympic marathon before the Games began, fought back tears as he recovered from a terrible start to secure gold on the track in a new world record time. \"Today I came and saw and conquered. That's why I gave the two-gun salute at the end,\" he said, referring to his biceps-flexing victory gesture.</p> <p>Loudly acclaimed by the 65,000 crowd inside the Olympic Stadium and no doubt those watching on television, his victory will go down alongside those of Mo Farah, Sir Chris Hoy and the rest in the annals of a remarkable British sporting summer. After the race, he said that he had aimed to show that Olympic and Paralympic athletes were on \"the same level\".</p> <p>If the roar and chanting of the crowd, the reaction on social networks and the level of interest in his remarkable victory were any guide, he can consider it mission accomplished.</p> <p>Whitehead, who was barred from competing in the marathon because the International Paralympic Committee said he couldn't race against arm amputees, powered to victory with a stunning second half of the race as he stormed through the field with his prosthetic legs swinging from one side to the other.</p> <p>Having slipped at the start \u2013 he was the only competitor to begin the race from a standing position, with the others crouching in the blocks \u2013 he went on to beat his own world record, during a race in which all nine runners recorded personal bests.</p> <p>Whitehead said victory was payback for his \"amazing team\" and paid tribute to a late friend who had helped inspire him.</p> <p>\"That wasn't for me, that wasn't for Richard Whitehead, it was for everyone who has supported me. I was fighting back tears towards the end and I had to take a couple of minutes to pull myself together,\" he said. \"There are so many people wanting you to win so it's a big weight to carry on your shoulders, but I've got broad shoulders so I can bear the weight.\"</p> <p>The roars as he crossed the line showing off his biceps were the equal of those for Ennis and Farah three weeks earlier; even though he was competing in a morning session, the stadium was again packed to the rafters.</p> <p>After he had completed an emotional lap of honour to the now familiar strains of David Bowie's Heroes, he said he wanted to win gold in tribute to his friend Simon Mellows, who died in 2005.</p> <p>\"The race didn't really go as expected; we were obviously pulled back, then I got off to a terrible start \u2013 I slipped \u2013 but I know my start isn't quick and I run with what inspires me and I did that for my friend Simon Mellows.\"</p> <p>It was Mellows who had helped inspire his love of sport when they played cricket together. He died after contracting a secondary cancer, leaving behind his wife and two daughters.</p> <p>They were in the stadium yesterday, as was Whitehead's pregnant fiancee, to see him secure an extraordinary victory that, along with Hannah Cockcroft's gold medal, seems to have lifted interest in these Games to another level.</p> <p>\"Each challenge I am faced with, I know he's there, looking down on me, kicking my butt whenever I need it,\" Whitehead has said of Mellows.</p> <p>In a packed Olympic Park yesterday, Whitehead's run was the talk of the crowds thronging into venues to watch sports many had never considered before they secured tickets, like goalball or wheelchair tennis.</p> <p>Barred from competing in the marathon in London because there is no category for leg amputees, Whitehead targeted the sprints instead in a category for amputees or those with a moderate impairment in one leg.</p> <p>The IPC refused him permission to race in the marathon against upper body amputees because it would confuse spectators and other athletes said it could be dangerous. An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was thrown out.</p> <p>Even after winning gold in the 200m and embarking on a lap of honour to a huge reception, Whitehead was already targeting his 100m race and the possibility of competing in the Paralympic marathon in four years' time.</p> <p>\"It's about having the opportunity to wear the GB vest. Hopefully the IPC will see sport as inclusive and not exclusive and let me run the marathon in Rio,\" said Whitehead, who also represented Britain at the 2006 Turin Paralympic Winter Games in sledge hockey.</p> <p>Whitehead, a congenital double above-the-leg amputee, was inspired to take up sport at the age of 11 by watching a documentary about Terry Fox, a Canadian amputee who embarked on a run across his country to raise money for cancer research.</p> <p>Having been encouraged by his parents to play a range of sports from gymnastics to cricket as a child, Whitehead took up marathon running in 2004 by entering the New York event.</p> <p>Training at night so as not to attract attention, he pushed himself through the pain barrier and received his first pair of carbon fibre running legs just 13 days before the race, which he eventually finished in just over five hours.</p> <p>On his return, he teamed up with British long distance runner Liz Yelling \u2013 a former training partner of Paula Radcliffe who competed in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics \u2013 and his times improved. He ran his first sub-three-hour marathon in 2009.</p> <p>Whitehead has since completed 24 marathons, with his best time a remarkable 2hr 42min 54sec, but he was forced to turn to sprinting if he wanted to compete in London. Having done so, he smashed the record for the 200m T42 at the European Championships in July.</p> <p>The former swimming coach and county school sports co-ordinator said that another part of his motivation had been to show that, given that they all devote years of single-minded training to their sport, Paralympians and Olympians should be considered on a par with one another.</p> <p>\"I wanted to show that Olympic and Paralympic athletes are on the same platform now,\" he said. \"We all perform to our highest ability and both Paralympic and Olympic athletes are inspiring a generation and leaving a legacy for years to come.</p> <p>\"For me that race was not for Richard Whitehead or for anybody else, but the nation. I'm very patriotic \u2013 that was for Great Britain.\"</p>",
  "<p>Watching Brazil's Paralympic seven-a-side football team at the Riverbank Arena was just like, well, watching Brazil. Electric pace, slick passing, ferocious on the counterattack and employing a mind boggling array of silky skills \u2013 all played on a wet pitch in front of a near capacity crowd \u2013 left Great Britain scratching their heads after going 3-0 down at half-time.</p> <p>Despite a disappointing scoreline for the hosts, the crowd were enthralled by a contest in which players with varying diagnoses of cerebral palsy compete on a 75x55m artificial pitch over 60 minutes.</p> <p>Cerebral palsy is habitually depicted as a severely debilitating condition, but all 14 players on the pitch on Saturday afternoon displayed a beauty of movement that thoroughly challenged such broad sweeping stereotypes. Interestingly it was only in the ordinary, non-footballing, moments: walking, clapping, or waving an arm, that their disabilities even became apparent.</p> <p>After 30 minutes of Brazilian genius in the first half, Lyndon Lynch's ParalympicsGB side changed goalkeepers and regrouped to return with emphasis after the break. Leading the charge was captain Matt Dimbylow \u2013 a 41-year-old hard man known as \"the Terminator\" and a juggernaut on the pitch. On three occasions the defender almost succeeded in reducing the deficit for his team.</p> <p>Like many of those playing, Dimbylow's story is inspirational. Having been forced to reconfigure his life after suffering a head trauma in July 2003, he was eventually diagnosed with Extrapyramidal Syndrome, a variant of Parkinson's disease that affects the parts of the brain that control movement and speech.</p> <p>\"I was told that I probably had 10 quality years of life left,\" he says. \"I learned who my friends were. But at last the thing had a name and a treatment. I kicked into action.\"</p> <p>And how. Even a lack of funding in the Paralympic year would not deter him, as the British captain was out selling scratchcards to raise funds to help the team's preparations. After the game the Terminator was almost reduced to tears as he tried to describe the emotion of leading the British team out in front of a rapturous 16,000-strong crowd. \"They got behind us every time we entered the Brazilian half,\" he said, likening their efforts to the din at a Millwall home game. \"Even at the end of the game we were still getting: 'we love you GB.' \"</p> <p>Despite the 3-0 scoreline, Dimbylow concurred that Britain have come a long way since a seventh place finish at the Beijing Paralympics. \"In the last four years we've gone from playing teams like Brazil who would absolutely hammer us \u2013 we'd be lucky to hold onto the ball \u2013 to now, where we are competitive,\" said the veteran.</p> <p>Britain's most famous team member, Martin Sinclair is the older brother of new Manchester City \u00a38m signing Scott. \"The Brazilians are renowned for their pace and I thought I needed players in there that could respond better to that,\" said Lynch, the head coach. \"Martin knows he's a key member of the squad and I'm sure he'll get his opportunity.\"</p> <p>Another host nation player with a celebrity connection is Michael Barker, a former Everton academy star who was a contemporary of Wayne Rooney. His football career changed dramatically after the striker was hit by a bus aged 15. Barker was told that might never walk again, but the suggestion of playing disabled football gave him renewed focus. \"To be honest, I was a bit sceptical,\" recalls Barker. \"I didn't class myself as disabled. I'd just had an accident, that's all. It's still hard to get your head around the word disabled. Coping with it all is as much mental as physical.</p> <p>\"Now, I just get on with it. Some days I'm more mobile than others. I just have to hope I have a good day on the pitch. I first went to the disability football because my family were urging me to try it. I was surprised by the high standard. I mean really high \u2013 these guys were good. The standard was higher than I'd previously played. I knew I'd have to work hard to get in the squad and it felt good, having something to work towards. The British team is the best it's been in ages, and I think we have a good chance in London 2012.\"</p> <p>Resurrecting their campaign against the Paralympic champions, Ukraine, will be a tough ask for the team on Monday. The title holders beat USA 9-0 in their first group game and have a strong advantage in being funded to train full-time, unlike Britain, whose best result in the competition was a bronze medal back in 1984 . \"Our realistic goals are a top six finish,\" said Lynch. \"We're in a tough group, with the Paralympic champions and Brazil who are ranked fourth in the world.</p> <p>\"We're just going to go into the next game now as a confident side, if we can score some goals we hope we can progress form there. It's not over yet.\"</p>",
  "<p>In Beijing, when Britain's Paralympians won an astonishing 17 cycling titles, it sometimes seemed they had only to clip a rider into the pedals for them to return with gold. The same holds true in London but with one significant caveat \u2013 if the rider happens to be called Storey.</p> <p>The first couple of the Paralympic velodrome \u2013 swimmer-turned cyclist Sarah, a medal machine for her country since her pool debut as a 14-year-old in Barcelona; and Barney, a triple gold medallist as tandem \"pilot\" to partially-sighted athletes \u2013 have now won three of GB's four cycling golds so far.</p> <p>Sarah Storey took her ninth Paralympic title and 20th medal in all in the 500m time trial for C4 and C5 classification riders, perhaps the weakest event of her four in London. The 34-year-old was the last of 14 riders to go out and she beat Jennifer Schuble of the USA into second by almost a second. Clearly thrilled and even surprised, she ripped off her racing helmet and rode an exultant lap of honour, stopping to embrace relatives on the front row.</p> <p>Storey, who has born with a partly-formed left hand, said: \"To come away with the gold medal at the end of my competition here at the velodrome and hear that roar again was just so proud, absolutely amazing.\"</p> <p>It came 48 hours after she won the C5 individual pursuit in almost absurdly convincing fashion. She now competes in the road race and road time trial. Success in those would take her equal to Tanni Grey-Thompson's mark of 11 Paralympic golds.</p> <p>Barney, 35, began Saturday's track session by piloting Neil Fachie, another refugee from a different sport \u2013 he was an athletics sprinter in 2008 \u2013 to gold in the men's tandem time trial, also setting a world record.</p> <p>Storey won two titles in Beijing with another British Paralympian, Anthony Kappes. In a paradoxical twist \u2013 and perhaps a sign that the couple are lucky as well as brilliant \u2013 Saturday's gold came after Kappes, the race favourite with the new pilot Craig McClean, were unable to race after their bike suffered technical problems on their two permitted starts.</p> <p>Barney said he was delighted to have bagged a gold before his wife claimed yet another: \"I had to try to do something to keep the male end up in the Storey household.\" He and Fachie go again on Sundayin the tandem sprint,</p> <p>Sarah was in the velodrome for their triumph. \"I was sat there watching just before I did my first warm-up and I was like, 'Wow, check that out. It's my turn. I've got to do him proud.'\"</p> <p>The couple met, not unexpectedly, through cycling in 2004 and married three years later, just in time to give the former Sarah Bailey a new name to go with her new sport after persistent ear troubles persuaded her to give up swimming. She took to cycling sufficiently well to just miss out on a place in the Olympic team pursuit line-up for London. Her husband has played a major role in this transformation, she said: \"Barney's at the centre of my world, obviously, but his expertise in cycling is just phenomenal. Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grands prix in Europe.</p> <p>\"Barney's got an immense knowledge and background in cycling. And when I came along, this big-shouldered, raw swimmer, he taught me everything I know.\"</p> <p>It must be presumed the family home in Disley, Cheshire, has a decent-sized display cabinet for medals, while the local post office is presumably hunting for more post boxes to paint gold.</p> <p>The family effort has lifted Britain to its customary place at the top of the cycling medals table, with four gold, five silver and two bronze. Saturday also featured a silver and a bronze, the former from Jon-Allan Butterworth, a 26-year-old former RAF technician who lost much of his left arm during a rocket attack on his base in Basra, his second such medals of the Games. Butterworth led for the first half of his 4km pursuit but was reeled in by Australia's Michael Gallagher, who eventually took gold by more than four seconds.</p> <p>The bronze was delivered by Jody Cundy a day after his controversial exit from the C4-C5 1km time trial, for which he was the clear favourite. He was apoplectic after officials denied him a re-run following a wheel spin he insisted was caused by a faulty start gate. He is significantly weaker in the pursuit and would most likely have struggled to reach the final even if it had not taken place a day after he went through one of the more public, vocal and sweary meltdowns seen recently in professional sport.</p> <p>As it was, the 33-year-old from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, who had part of his left leg amputated in infancy and races with a union flag-embossed prosthesis in the C4 classification, missed out on the gold medal ride-off by half a second in yesterday morning's heats, an outcome he described as \"gutting\".</p> <p>Twenty-four hours of frustration was duly taken out on the unfortunate Diego Gomez, Cundy's opponent in the third-place race. Cheered on by a noisy and unashamedly partisan crowd Cundy caught the Colombian little more than a third of the way through the event's scheduled 4km length, which automatically ends a pursuit race.</p> <p>If anyone retrospectively doubted Cundy's ability to win the 1km time trial he answered this too. In the first 1,000m of his pursuit \u2013 a 4km event, remember \u2013 Cundy clocked 1:05.317 minutes, fast enough to win Friday's 1km event, known in cycling as the kilo.</p> <p>\"My coach just told me the kilo time was quicker than what everybody did last night so up yours to it,\" a combative Cundy said after the race. \"It's reassuring that my form's there. I was in good shape for the gold medal last night and kind of robbed, but there we go, I got a bronze tonight and I'll treat that as my gold.\"</p>",
  "<p>Steve Clarke must feel like management is a breeze. The West Bromwich Albion head coach has barely been in the job two minutes but he has already presided over the Midlands club's best start to a top-flight season since 1978, lifting them to the dizzy heights of third place and leapfrogging Everton in the process.</p> <p>Liverpool were vanquished on the opening day here and their Merseyside rivals suffered the same fate on an afternoon when goals from Shane Long, who had hit the bar with a header in the first half, and Gareth McAuley inflicted a first defeat of the season on Everton.</p> <p>It was a disappointing afternoon for David Moyes's side and in particular for Marouane Fellaini, who wasted several decent chances, including a golden opportunity just before Long gave Albion the lead. The Belgian cut a frustrated figure as he argued with the referee, Jon Moss, about being penalised for free-kicks, and his miserable day was complete when he picked up a second-half booking for a foul on Long.</p> <p>By that point the game was slipping away from an Everton team who had arrived full of confidence and looking to make it three straight league victories at the start of a season for the first time in 19 years. Although Fellaini was guilty of profligacy, Everton never clicked as an attacking force and found Albion a very different proposition to the Aston Villa side who rolled over last weekend. Albion looked solid defensively, have two excellent holding midfielders in the shape of Claudio Yacob and Youssouf Mulumbu, and carry a threat on the counterattack.</p> <p>\"It was a good game for us,\" said Clarke, whose side drew at White Hart Lane in between their wins over Liverpool and Everton. \"The first half was a bit cagey but in the second half, when the game opened up a little bit, I thought we were good value. It's a good start to the season. When you looked at the games we had, you thought it would be difficult. But seven points from nine is something to build on.\"</p> <p>Long's goal, which came at the end of a flowing move that started at the back and ended with the substitute Peter Odemwingie delivering a sublime cross from the left that implored the Albion striker to stab home, came at a crucial juncture in the game. Fellaini had just side-footed high and wide with the goal at his mercy and a couple of minutes before that Moyes had gone for broke, replacing Steven Naismith with Kevin Mirallas to chase three points. It was a tactical decision that the Everton manager was left to regret.</p> <p>\"I thought for probably the first hour we had good control but we didn't do well enough in the final third and that was the reason we didn't win,\" Moyes said. \"I made a change to try to go for it because I thought we weren't doing enough to score and in opening up we conceded a goal from it, so I probably should have stayed the way we were.</p> <p>\"But I wanted to try to win the game and we had enough of the ball to do that. But in the final third we hardly crossed it, we hardly passed it well. But that's great credit to West Brom. They look as if they've still got Roy's shape about them at times.\"</p> <p>There was certainly no way back for Everton \u2013 who lost Darron Gibson to a thigh strain in the first half \u2013 once McAuley headed home Chris Brunt's inswinging corner with Tim Howard caught in no man's land.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Afternoon. What's the rumpus? We're a little busy today so I shall dispense with the usual epiphany-inducing prose that you find in these preambles. These are the four 3pm fixtures in the Premier League:</p> <blockquote> <p>Swansea v Sunderland<br>Tottenham v Norwich<br>West Brom v Everton<br>Wigan v Stoke</p> </blockquote> <p>Shall we proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hardcore team news?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <h2>Tottenham v Norwich team news</h2> <p><strong>Tottenham (4-2-3-1)</strong>: Friedel; Walker, Gallas, Vertonghen, Assou-Ekotto; Livermore, Sandro; Lennon, Sigurdsson, Bale; Defoe.<br>Subs: Cudicini, Huddlestone, Adebayor, Naughton, Dembele, Townsend,<br>Caulker.</p> <p><strong>Norwich (4-2-3-1)</strong>: Ruddy; Russell Martin, Bassong, Barnett, Garrido; Johnson, Howson; Snodgrass, Jackson, Pilkington; Holt.<br>Subs: Rudd, Turner, Surman, Hoolahan, Morison, Tierney, Tettey.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Mark Halsey (Lancashire)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.26pm</strong> Manchester City aren't playing till this evening but they have had an early boost with the news that Mario Balotelli will be out for a month after eye surgery. It wasn't commented on that much at the time, but Balotelli's red card at Arsenal won City the league last year.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <h2>Wigan v Stoke team news</h2> <p><strong>Wigan (3-4-2-1)</strong>: Al Habsi; Ramis, Caldwell, Figueroa; Boyce, McArthur, McCarthy, Beausejour; Kone, Maloney; Di Santo.<br>Subs: Pollitt, Jones, Crusat, Watson, Gomez, Boselli, Miyaichi.</p> <p><strong>Stoke (4-4-2)</strong>: Begovic; Wilkinson, Huth, Shawcross, Wilson; Whelan, Cameron, Whitehead, Kightly; Crouch, Walters.<br>Subs: Sorensen, Pennant, Jones, Edu, Adam, Upson, Jerome.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.36pm</strong> West Ham battered Fulham 3-0 in the early fixture, with Andy Carroll causing mayhem in the traditional style. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/01/premierleague-fulham\">You can revisit the match with Scott Murray's minute-by-minute report</a>.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <h2>West Brom v Everton team news</h2> <p><strong>West Brom (4-2-3-1):</strong> Foster; Reid, Olsson, McAuley, Ridgewell; Yacob, Mulumbu; Dorrans, Morrison, Fortune; Long.<br>Subs: Myhill, Rosenberg, Brunt, Gera, Odemwingie, Dawson, Jones.</p> <p><strong>Everton (4-4-1-1):</strong> Howard; Neville, Jagielka, Distin, Baines; Naismith, Osman, Gibson, Pienaar; Fellaini; Jelavic.<br>Subs: Mucha, Hibbert, Heitinga, Mirallas, Gueye, Coleman, Anichebe.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Jon Moss (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <h2>Swansea v Sunderland team news</h2> <p><strong>Swansea (4-2-3-1):</strong> Vorm; Rangel, Williams, Chico, Taylor; Britton, de Guzman; Dyer, Michu, Routledge; Graham.<br>Subs: Tremmel, Tate, Shechter, Moore, Ki, Agustien, Davies.</p> <p><strong>Sunderland (4-2-3-1)</strong>: Mignolet; Gardner, Cuellar, O'Shea, Colback; Larsson, Cattermole; Johnson, Sessegnon, McClean; Fletcher.<br>Subs: Westwood, Campbell, Kilgallon, Ji, Meyler, Bramble, Saha.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Roger East (Wiltshire)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.52pm</strong> \"Bit harsh on Mario, I mean he did squeeze that ball to Aguero, didn't he?\" says Phil Podolsky. \"And that he's a superior player to Dzeko even Dzeko's mom could not deny. But then Dzeko did score that header from that corner.

Look, I don't know, OK?\"</p> <p>Let's sort this debate in the modern style: with a slanging match on Twitter. Aw, look, Balotelli's clearly a cracking player, but him being sent off put Tevez back into the team, and that's wot won it.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.58pm</strong> Here's a topical video: Eric Cantona emerging in a pink shower cap. <a href=\"www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAAnz6NbAQU#t=20m15s\">It's safe for work</a>.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.59pm</strong> Fashionista update: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/aug/31/baseball-caps-sales-fashion-comeback?newsfeed=true\">trendsetter Tony Pulis is wearing a baseball cap</a>.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3pm</strong> As the four matches kick off, I'm watching a bloody Meerkat advert on Sky Sports News. How's that for an interactive experience?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.01pm</strong> \"Re: Balotelli's contribution to the $ity title,\" says Lou Roper. \"Yes, his sending off did permit the return of Tevez, but didn't his own return \u2013not coincidentally, at the expense of world-class whinger Nasri \u2013 provide the last piece?\" Yes, but if he hadn't been sent off at Arsenal his contribution on the last day would have been irrelevant because United would have been over the hill and far, far away.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Wigan 1-0 Stoke (Maloney 5 pen)</strong> A goal for Wigan at Fortress DW, a penalty from Shaun Maloney. I have no idea what actually happened because I missed Phil Thompson's description on Sky Sports News. You're welcome!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.08pm</strong> Apparently the penalty was given for [Stoke] ball-to-hand [/Stoke] / [Wigan] hand-to-ball [/Wigan] against Robert Huth. Just think, Robert Huth once played centre forward against Barcelona in the European Cup. Has there ever been a greater act of cultural vandalism in the history of football? Apart from that first half at Upton Park this afternoon, obviously.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong> Norwich's Russell Martin has nutted the ball against the bar at White Hart Lane.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.11pm</strong> In topical news, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSRjWOxL0gI\">look at this scissor kick from 1985</a>!</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.12pm</strong> These are the latest scores in the Barclays Premier League sponsored by Barclays Bank.

A stretcher and oxygen are being brought onto the field.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.18pm</strong> Everton are dominating the match at the Hawthorns, according to Paul Merson. They looked seriously good at Villa Park last weekend, although Villa were so poor that it's difficult to judge just how good Everton were.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.19pm</strong> Still no further news on Neil Taylor.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong> \"It must be as odd for West Ham fans to cope with success while playing in a style that goes against what most associate as their heritage of playing good footer on t' earth, as it is for Man City fans to not be able to enjoy misery,\" says Ian Copestake.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.21pm</strong> \"Re: Wigan's goal description,\" says Peter Crosby. \"Is this what my life has been reduced to?

Keep up the good work.\" I can't remember.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.27pm</strong> \"I agree with you on Balotelli up to a point,\" says Niall Mullen. \"But the rush to kick him while he was down at the end of last year by many pundits and fans (not you) verged on bullying. Many of the Premier League era greats (Cantona, Keane, Bergkamp) had more than a bit of the devil in them but they seemed a lot less vulnerable than the adopted kid who grew up to the whistles of racist abuse in Italy. Listening to his sister on the radio before the Euro final was heartbreaking as she declared her love for him and batted away the myriad Mario apocrypha usually accepted as factual. That's a very long winded way of saying give the kid a break.\"</p> <p>I take your point \u2013 I actually quite like Balotelli, for what it's worth \u2013 but surely the point is that Cantona, Keane and Bergkamp were great players and thus their excesses were more tolerable? If you're going to pull stunts, you'd better be good. When Liverpool wore their cream Armani suits at Wembley, John Barnes said something like: \"If you wear a suit like that, you'd better win.\" When, during that infamous Leicester La Manga booze-up in 2000, Ian Marshall phoned Martin O'Neill in the small hours to tell him he loved him, O'Neill apparently addressed Marshall while giving the whole team a bollocking the next day and said something like: \"You haven't done enough in the game, son, to be calling me at 3am telling me you love me.\" By the same token, if you're going to have as much baggage as Balotelli, you'd better be worth it on the field.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.31pm</strong> Norwich have been the better side at White Hart Lane, with Bradley Johnson blootering one just over from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.33pm</strong> \"The Spurs Norwich game is a bit crap at the moment,\" says Richard Hooker, \"so I took the opportunity to have a squint at the Barclays privacy policy.

And on that subject Rob (and Niall Mullen), please don't mention Cantona in the same breath as Bergkamp and Keane. A better player than Balotelli for sure but a victory for style over substance in the same vein. Only Utd fans rate him highly.\"</p> <p>That's true, and I suppose some people might argue that United fans rate him highly because they watched him every week, saw him revolutionise the entire club, catalyse not one but <em>two</em> generations of title-winning players, win four titles out of five \u2013 one pretty much on his own \u2013 after the club had won none in 26 before his arrival, and start a relationship with those fans of such an enduring and spiritual nature that only the ignorant or envious would seriously attempt to compare it to any other in the history of football. That's what some people might argue, I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4pm</strong> \"Isn't Balotelli's best position substitute?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Like a closer in baseball, his unpredictable play might be just what's needed to turn a game.

  "<p>Coming around the bend in his 200m final, Richard Whitehead was just about in last place. Ten seconds or so later, at the other end of the straight, he was the Paralympic champion and world record holder in the T42 category. He even had time enough to strike a pose as he crossed the line, flexing his muscles like a strongman on a stage. He was more than a second clear of his nearest rival, the USA's Shaquille Vance. It was one of the great races, and greatest performances, that the Olympic stadium has hosted this summer. Every single one of the nine runners contesting the final set a personal best. The first five home broke the Paralympic record, set in 2004. But none of them got close to Whitehead.</p> <p>\"For me that race was not for Richard Whitehead but for the nation,\" said Whitehead, who suffers the unfortunate impairment of habitually talking about himself in the third person. It was excusable, in the circumstances. Whitehead was overcome with emotion after his memorable win, with a tumult of thoughts tumbling around his mind. \"I am lost for words,\" he said. \"As soon as I came across the line I had a couple of minutes just to myself because it has been a long journey.\"</p> <p>Mainly, Whitehead was thinking about his friend, and old team-mate in the England Developmental disabled cricket team, Simon Mellows, who died of sarcoma in 2005. \"To see the kind of fight that he went through with a young family set a seed in my head about what sport's all about,\" Whitehead said. \"Unfortunately he couldn't be successful in his sporting career to a level that he wanted to be. He said that one day he wanted to run or push or wheel a marathon with him, but that I would be successful on this stage. That's why I looked up \u2013 because I just wanted to tell him: 'Yeah, it's over now'.\"</p> <p>Mellows's widow and children were in the crowd, along with Whitehead's parents, and his fiancee, Valerie, who is pregnant with their child. During his exuberant lap of honour, he had to push past the stewards to make his way up into the arms of his family.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, he was up on the podium, struggling to control himself. \"I'm very patriotic,\" Whitehead said. \"That was for Great Britain, that was for Team GB, that was for all my support team, all my sponsors, the National Lottery, everybody who pulled behind Richard Whitehead. This is why I'm successful, its nothing to do with any kind of technology, I just work my arse off to be the best athlete I can be.\"</p> <p>Whitehead, who is amputated above the knee on both legs, is also the world record holder in the T42 marathon, with a time of 2hr 42min 54sec. He switched disciplines after learning that he would not be eligible to run that event in London. The 200m world record is now 24.38sec, 0.55 faster than the one he set in 2011. It is some double.</p> <p>At the age of 35, he had to learn to run the bend. \"There aren't many as sharp as that around London and New York,\" he said. \"It is tough, I have so many levers, there is so much g-force going through my hips I feel like Jenson Button going around the corners.\"</p> <p>Five times, in training and competition, he has snapped his running blades as tries to take the turn. They are not the only piece of kit he relies on. Since 2004 Whitehead has always run in the same pair of lucky black underpants. \"Maybe I'll be the next Calvin Klein underwear model,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It's all about self belief. I always say to myself, 'It's not A to B, it's B to A.' That's believe, achieve. It's really important you've got that self belief and that's the message I'm going to pass on to all my fellow athletes. The crowd out here, there are 80,000 people that are wanting you to win, not 80,000 putting heavy weight on those shoulders. That's why I've got big shoulders, you bear that weight and hopefully my performance today has inspired the next athlete to come on the track and smash it for Team GB.\"</p> <p>It worked. Great Britain also won three bronzes in the morning session, all in field events. Gemma Prescott was third in the F31/32/51 club throw, thanks to a European record of 20.50m. She had been trackside to watch Whitehead's run. \"I'd actually just come back&#xa0;from the bathroom, so I was right trackside for that. That really lifted us,\" she said.</p> <p>Robin Womack, who took up sport while he was a patient at Stoke Mandeville hospital, the cradle of the Games, threw a personal best of 11.34m to take third in the F54/55/56 shot put. And Claire Williams added another bronze in the F11/12 discus.</p> <p>The loudest cheer of all, though, was reserved for Djibouti's Houssein Omar Hassan, who took 11min 23.50sec to finish the T46 1,500m. That made him almost seven minutes slower than the man in seventh. He had the track to himself for the last kilometre. He had, he explained, injured his ankle, but still wanted to finish. As Whitehead said \"Sport's not about individual success. It's about how you can embrace people.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Jarawa!\" The cry goes up from the front of the bus and, in an instant, the tourists are on their feet, craning their necks to see a small boy clutching a short spear.</p> <p>He is standing on the edge of the jungle, watching the convoy of vehicles thunder past on the Andaman trunk road. The tourists lurch towards the right-hand side of the vehicle to catch one last glimpse of him and then the government-run bus is past and he is gone.</p> <p>It is Wednesday morning, three days before the start of the official tourist season and eight months since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/07/andaman-islands-tribe-tourism-threat\" title=\"\">an <em>Observer </em>investigation into the plight of the aboriginal Jarawa tribe</a>, and an accompanying video of young tribal women dancing semi-naked for food, scandalised India and brought international condemnation of the Andaman human safaris.</p> <p>The spectacle of more than a third of a million people pouring through the dwindling tribe's jungle reserve each year, many of them intent on catching a glimpse of its largely reclusive inhabitants, prompted an outpouring of fury that could not be ignored.</p> <p>The Indian government moved swiftly to introduce laws punishing interference with the Jarawa with seven years in jail. Two policemen were arrested over the video, and the inspector general of police was transferred after he was caught taking his family on a human safari. In July the country's supreme court \u2013 which ordered the closure of the road in 2002 \u2013 banned commercial and tourist activity inside a 5km buffer zone around the tribal reserve, warning that any breach of the order would amount to contempt of court. That should have been the end of the human safaris, the term coined to describe the eight daily convoys of vehicles that run up and down the road through the heart of the pristine jungle.</p> <p>Last week, however, when the <em>Observer</em> returned to the Andamans, it was business as usual for the human safari industry. Not only does it continue, but it does so with the blessing of the Andaman and Nicobar administration, which runs its own daily tourist bus through the reserve. It costs 1,000 rupees (\u00a311.36) for a ticket on the air-conditioned bus (850 rupees without air conditioning), ostensibly to visit a limestone cave and mud \"volcano\" on Baratang island, which lies 100km north of the capital, Port Blair \u2013 and inside the buffer zone fixed by the supreme court.</p> <p>Hundreds of private tour operators offer their own versions of the tour. But as the reactions of the bus passengers testify, the real attraction of the trip is that it runs through the Jarawa reserve on South Andaman island and offers the opportunity to see the inhabitants in their natural habitat.</p> <p>The white bus, with the national tourism advertising slogan \"Incredible !ndia\" painted on its side in large blue letters, picks up its first passengers next to the statue of Gandhi in the centre of Port Blair at 6.30am. A private bus company offering the same trip is collecting passengers from the same spot. It has been raining heavily, but it starts to ease as the bus heads north, entering the tall forest with its mix of hardwood trees and coconut palms. The bus draws up at the last checkpoint before the reserve to await the start of the second convoy of the day. The 13 passengers climb out and head for the stalls selling snacks and drinks.</p> <p>Half a dozen cars are parked at the side of the road, also waiting for the convoy to start. Five minutes before the tour is due to depart, a loudspeaker crackles into life, instructing those waiting by their vehicles to stick to the rules, which are set out on the board \u2013 not yet updated \u2013next to the police post: don't give the Jarawa bananas and biscuits, don't take pictures, don't stop, don't let the Jarawa into your vehicles. Anyone breaking the law faces five years in jail.</p> <p>The passengers board the bus and a policeman with a luxuriant handlebar moustache joins the tour, clutching an ancient Lee-Enfield .303 rifle. Then the convoy is off, picking up speed and bouncing along the uneven surface. The rain has stopped and the trees glisten with moisture. Those on board do not have to wait long.</p> <p>\"Jarawa!\" The driver points to the side of the road ahead. The tourists are on their feet, eager to catch a glimpse. A man is crouching by the road with a bow on his knees. The bus flashes past. \"Jarawa,\" the tourists say contentedly to each other as they sit down. This is what they came for. The cave is an unimpressive gash in a limestone cliff, the mud \"volcano\" merely a large puddle that occasionally belches out a few bubbles of gas from decomposing vegetation trapped below. This is the main event. But they have heeded the warnings: no one tries to take pictures and the sealed bus windows make throwing out food an impossibility.</p> <p>The bus breaks down and everyone is decanted on to the private vehicle that is following behind. There is another hiatus as the convoy squeezes past another, larger one, coming in the opposite direction. Then it is off again, moving swiftly, the new vehicle bouncing fiercely.</p> <p>\"Jarawa!\" This time it is two women, naked from the waist up, with bright red cloth wrapped around their heads. The tourists are on their feet.</p> <p>\"Jarawa!\" Every few minutes, the cry goes up. Each time the tourists spring up, but there are several false alarms.</p> <p>The policeman, also standing now, forgets his rifle, propped against the back of a seat, and it crashes to the floor of the bus as the vehicle hits another pothole. He picks it up, glances sideways, then stares straight ahead.</p> <p>There are 22 people on the bus now and most are on their feet, peering out of the windows on the left side. Then the forest ends abruptly and the bus pulls up next to a jetty. The passengers board a ferry and a local bus and a couple of cars squeeze in behind them. It takes less than 10 minutes to reach Baratang, where a small flotilla of motorboats is waiting to convey the tourists to the walkway that gives way to a muddy path leading 1.2km inland to the cave. A few people make appreciative noises as the guide points out the stalagmites and stalactites inside.</p> <p>Although Baratang lies within the buffer zone, the island's administration has allowed the tours to continue, claiming that it has sought an eight-week stay to allow time for an appeal, a request refused by the supreme court.</p> <p>Two boat rides later and the tourists are back on the bus. A couple ask about the \"volcano\", but the guide shrugs and says it is not worth seeing. At 3pm the convoy sets off, and for those hoping to see members of the tribe it is a vintage afternoon. \"Jarawa!\" \"Jarawa!\" \"Jarawa!\" A woman, then a man, then the child with his spear, then another woman. The tourists are leaning forward, some not even bothering to sit down as they try to get a better view through the windscreen.</p> <p>This is not a big convoy: a dozen cars, four buses and a couple of lorries. Even so, the vehicles are carrying about 100 people. Another convoy squeezes past, heading towards Baratang, the last northbound convoy of the day, made up of 10 cars and five buses. At the height of the tourist season there can be as many as 150 private tour vehicles on the first convoy of the day alone, along with the tour buses and commercial vehicles. During the tourist season, which runs from September to May, an estimated 250 vehicles use the road each day. The number drops to 150 during the off season.</p> <p>Even using the low vehicle and passenger figures from this one trip, that amounts to almost 150,000 people a year going up and down the road. Factor in the much higher numbers travelling when the tourist season is at its peak and a very conservative average of 500 people on the road every day produces an annual total of 180,000 people. Even if only half of them were tourists, they outnumber the Jarawa by 228 to one.</p> <p>There is widespread agreement that this volume of interference with the Jarawa's nomadic, largely insular existence can only hasten their demise.</p> <p>The Andamans lie in the Bay of Bengal, closer to Burma than to India, and anthropologists say the tribe has been there for tens of thousands of years, probably having migrated from Africa. It is only 14 years since they dropped their hostile attitude towards outsiders and started to come out of the jungle in any numbers. Before that, intruders had to risk attack from members armed with bows and arrows and there were numerous fatal clashes. Some younger members of the tribe are voluntarily seeking contact now, but most shun it.</p> <p>Environmental groups, including Survival International, warn that interaction with outsiders will lead to destruction of the Jarawa, as it has done with other tribes on the islands, including the Great Andamanese, who once lived in large numbers around Port Blair. Survival has repeatedly called for closure of the road, but the islands' administration appears determined to keep it open to provide access for settlers. It is 10 years since India's supreme court first ordered the closure of the road to protect the Jarawa.</p> <p>Despite the international outrage, despite the anger of the government in Delhi, despite the rulings of the highest court in the land, despite the repeated interventions of Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi on behalf of the Jarawa, the human safaris go on.</p>",
  "<p>She has honed the physiques of \"supermums'' Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Lopez and Madonna, so when the celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson whipped herself back into shape only six weeks after giving birth \u2013 by caesarean section \u2013 to her daughter, Penelope, it was a fitting advertisement for her exercise DVD, <em>The Pregnancy Project</em>.</p> <p>However, it was also yet another crushing blow for new mothers all over the western world: women who weeks, months or even years after giving birth still bemoan their sagging, stretchmark-covered mummy tummies.

She is the former editor-in-chief of celebrity gossip magazine <em>US Weekly</em>: under her reign, between 2003 and 2009, its circulation grew from 800,000 to 1.9m and she pocketed a reputed $2m a year salary. She defined her formula for publishing success: \"As the editor of <em>US Weekly</em>, covering the Suris and Shilohs of Hollywood for six years, I delivered what the young female audience wanted: cute moms and babies.\"</p> <p>So, as she rightly points out in her <em>New York Times</em> piece, she is \"partly to blame\" for the culture in which we live, where everyday mothers are bombarded with a daily diet of celebrity mothers and their beautiful bodies. In fact, in typical 21st-century fashion, a trendy hybrid label has been coined so we can recognise these glamorous supermothers: the momshell (mom and bombshell \u2013 geddit?).</p> <p>\"These genetic aberrations smile at us from celebrity magazines, or from our computer screens, wearing bikinis on the beach in Cabo weeks after caesarean sections, or going straight from recovery room to Victoria's Secret runway,\" Min wrote.</p> <p>Cue the backlash: the blogosphere has gone mad. What right does this woman have to complain about the monster she created? Even the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> got in on the act, pointing out with more than a hint of cynicism that Min has just written a book, <em>How to Look Hot in a Minivan: A Real Woman's Guide to Losing Weight, Looking Great and Dressing Chic in the Age of the Celebrity Mom.</em></p> <p>But Min does have a point, however hypocritical it is to make it. In the internet age, we cannot avoid being inundated with images that, even subliminally, make us feel inadequate if we boast so much as a muffin top at toddler group.</p> <p>Gemma Beckers gave birth to her first baby, Lena, on 10 August and only three weeks into motherhood she admits: \"I worry more about my appearance now than I ever did before I was pregnant. Now I find myself comparing how I look to other new mums, like it's some gauge of how we're coping with the rollercoaster journey.\" The 29-year-old fashion buyer from Hove, East Sussex, confesses she is addicted to celebrity gossip magazines, but acknowledges, \"they never show the chef, the nutritionist, the personal trainer, the nanny, the housekeeper, the beautician and all the other staff required to get those Hollywood mums looking photo-ready. I'm flabbergasted to see celebrities who've carried a baby full term and then parade in a bikini after a month.\"</p> <p>Professional cellist Emma Black, 43, mother of Maya, 5 and Lotte, 2, from Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, feels the momshell culture \"is pernicious and damaging to women. I am that bit older. I was 38 when I had my first baby, and I think that helps because I am more comfortable in my own skin, but you need to have a robust sense of self not to be pulled in by the constant stream of 'perfect' celebrity images.</p> <p>\"It makes me desperately sad to see mothers lacking confidence because they don't look a certain way, or talking about weight loss when they've just given birth. It takes away from the joy of motherhood.\"</p> <p>There are, of course, those rare beings who shed the pounds rapidly. \"I am naturally thin and was taken aback by how quickly the weight came off \u2013 without effort - after having my daughter (now seven), so I was back in my skinny jeans within days,\" says Jo Elvin, the Australian editor of <em>Glamour</em> magazine. \"But I am really disturbed by this phenomenon. The celebrity thing has got so out of hand and we are studying them in microscopic detail: obsessing over how someone looks, after giving birth especially, is so unhealthy.\"</p> <p>Psychologically, the impact of a glossy, glamorous supermodel in a designer bikini cradling her newborn in St Barts is one that can really send a hormonal, sleep-deprived, first-time mother into hiding with only her husband's pyjamas and dressing gown for company.</p> <p>It certainly doesn't help when models such as Heidi Klum, Gisele Bundchen and Miranda Kerr snap back to their svelte pre-pregnancy shape before their offspring have got through their first pack of disposable nappies. Or when Victoria Beckham appears at New York fashion week in one of her bodycon frocks, hugging the newborn Harper Seven. Or again when Beyonc\u00e9 drops 60lb within weeks of delivering daughter Blue Ivy, crediting \"cardio and sculpting sessions five days a week, plus tour rehearsals\" for the weight loss.</p> <p>And let's face it: if you didn't look like a Victoria's Secret angel before gestation, you sure as hell aren't going to look like one after giving birth.</p> <p>Tim Weeks, a former Olympic coach who now works as a personal trainer specialising in women's fitness and wellbeing, points out that exercising too soon after giving birth is far from ideal. His GP wife, Yasmin, presented him with a son, Rafi, eight weeks ago and he insists she should only now be starting very gentle swimming or yoga. \"You need to look at giving birth like major surgery, even if you have a natural birth. If you have any kind of surgical procedure, you would have a rest period, then a slow rehabilitation period, then a proper recovery period. Your body has gone through massive physiological changes, and it's not just a matter of doing a few sit-ups to fix a flabby tummy \u2013 you need to rebalance all the elements, which is a long, slow process. You need to look at cardiorespiratory fitness, structural strength and posture, nutrition, rest and recovery and your psychological wellbeing.\"</p> <p>\"Your hormones are all over the place, your body has dealt with another human being growing inside you, then pushed it out. I don't let any of my 'new mum' clients do any exercise, other than a gentle stroll with the pram, for six weeks. Even if they are superfit, Olympic-standard athletes, they would expect a rest and recovery period after an 'injury': this is the same.\"</p> <p>His views are echoed by Michael Dooley, a specialist sports gynaecologist, who acted as senior gynaecologist at the London Olympics. \"Every woman is individual and you must listen to your body. If you are used to being in control of your life, you have to accept that you have to relinquish that for a while. Your life has been taken over by a demanding baby and there will be pressure from all areas to make you feel you are not doing things right, or you haven't snapped back into shape quickly enough. But it takes time, so take time. I think it takes a year for your body to fully recuperate from the physiological changes in pregnancy, so set smart, achievable targets.\"</p> <p>Thankfully, a handful of high-profile women are happy to follow this path. John Travolta's wife, the actress Kelly Preston, 49, said she refused to rush her weight loss after giving birth to Benjamin in 2010. \"I actually took my time purposely because I really wanted to. You can do it much more quickly,\" Preston told <em>Good Morning America</em>. \"I'm not into the three to four weeks. But I did it over the course of eight months.\"</p> <p>Bollywood beauty Ashwarya Rai was cruelly lambasted for not shedding the pounds after the birth of her daughter in November 2011, but claimed that she wanted to focus on her baby before turning the spotlight on her own wellbeing.</p> <p>The BBC2 radio presenter Janey Lee Grace, mother of four children and author of <em>Imperfectly Natural Woman </em>and<em> Imperfectly Natural Baby and Toddler</em>, says: \"In an ideal world, you would have a babymoon where you put your feet up and look after your newborn, while your friends and family look after your home and cook.\"</p> <p>In fact, in some Asian cultures \u2013 China, in particular \u2013 the practice of confinement is still popular, with some \"postpartum houses\" cropping up to cater for immigrants in US cities, using doulas in the place of relatives to support new mothers. Though it may seem outdated to many modern western women \u2013 it was common in Victorian times in the UK \u2013 there may be something to be said for the idea of focusing on bonding with your baby while being looked after by others, away from public scrutiny and exposure to celebrity momshells.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><em>Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours, and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away. The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. It was the first time that they had ever seen Benjamin excited \u2014 indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop. 'Quick, quick!' he shouted. 'Come at once! They're taking Boxer away!' Without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm buildings. Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat. And Boxer's stall was empty.</em></p> <p><em>The animals crowded round the van. 'Good-bye, Boxer!' they chorused, 'good-bye!'</em></p> <p><em>'Fools! Fools!' shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. 'Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?'</em></p> <p><em>That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to spell out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read:</em></p> <p><em>' 'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.' Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!'</em></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>On Thursday evening, Liverpool Football Club sent the limited but willing, hard-working and loyal Andy Carroll away in the van.</strong> He didn't want to leave, and subsequent events at Anfield suggest Brendan Rodgers might now be having second thoughts about getting rid. But in the long run, his move to West Ham United could work out brilliantly for all parties. This could be the start of something special.</p> <p><strong>Carroll's style of play was never compatible with the blueprint for New Liverpool; he might, however, score plenty of goals at his new club, whose manager Sam Allardyce favours a more, eh, robust style.</strong> Forget the cheap jibes; there's a player inside Carroll. He's never going to be the next Lionel Messi, but this transfer deadline could have the pleasant effect of reinvigorating the most expensive English player in history.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>But let's not forget Fulham have just brought in a major talent too, in Dimitar Berbatov.</strong> What news of him? He's currently halfway through Keep the Aspidistra Flying, which he's enjoying with an espresso and a cheroot. Oh, and he's eligible to play today, too.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 12.45pm.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>West Ham United throw Big Andy straight into the starting line-up:</strong> Jaaskelainen, Demel, Reid, Collins, O'Brien, Diame, Noble, Nolan, Taylor, Vaz Te, Carroll.<br>Subs: Henderson, Tomkins, Cole, Maiga, Diarra, O'Neil, Hall.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Fulham name Dimitar Berbatov on the bench, where he can finish reading his novel:</strong> Schwarzer, Riether, Hughes, Hangeland, Riise, Duff, Sidwell, Diarra, Richardson, Rodallega, Petric.<br>Subs: Stockdale, Kelly, Baird, Kasami, Berbatov, Briggs, Kacaniklic.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Anthony Taylor (Cheshire)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Early-morning existential angst (brought to you, surprisingly, courtesy of Andy Carroll rather than Dimitar Berbatov):</strong> \"Oh come on!\" cries Alex Hanton. \"You can't open a lighthearted MBM with the most harrowing moment of what's already a pretty upsetting book. This is like Match of the Day replacing its opening titles with that scene where Bambi's mum gets shot.\" I'd pay good money to see Gary Lineker quip his way out of that one. His ironic eyebrows would have to start pinging up and down like the flippers on a pinball table to deflect that hospital pass.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>The teams are out!</strong> West Ham are in their famous claret and blue - with a lovely old-fashioned collar, not as nice as the 1964 FA Cup final shirt, but you can't have everything - while Fulham are also decked out in their trademark garb, a really fetching black pinstripe down the front of their white shirts. A lovely atmosphere of expectation at the Boleyn Ground, both sets of fans looking forward to seeing what their new charges can do.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> The home fans give a hearty rendition of Bubbles, and their lads set the ball rolling. The ball's lumped down the right wing, and immediately lost. Onwards and upwards.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>51 seconds: GOAL!!! West Ham United 1-0 Fulham.</strong> Andy Carroll has taken just over 40 seconds to make his mark in east London. He wins a majestic header, the ball being lumped down the middle. He flicks it on to Vaz Te down the inside-right channel. Vaz Te cuts inside, and knocks the ball left to Nolan, who guides a brilliant first-time shot back across goal and into the right-hand corner of the net. Penny for Brendan Rodgers thoughts.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Some fantastic reaction shots after that goal. Sam Allardyce was, as you'd expect, delighted. Carroll and his old pal/Toon-team-mate/landlord/babysitter Nolan hug warmly, with huge smiles. Martin Jol grits his teeth. I think he might have just ground them down into the sort of fine powder you could sieve through a pair of tights.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Fulham respond through Rodallega, who has a weak shot. West Ham pelt down the other end, through Taylor down the left. His cross into the area is a dangerous one, right along the corridor of uncertainty, but there's nobody on hand to poke home.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Richardson has a flash at goal from a very long way out indeed. A daisycutter aimed for the bottom right, it's a decent effort, and one which the shaky Jaaskelainen can only parry, but Collins is the only man near the loose ball and clears up. \"Not only is Berbatov rolling a fag,\" notes Simon McMahon, \"he is washing down his plate of full English with three fingers of single malt. What a legend.\" He's an amazingly unflappable character. Someone's got to encourage him to write some short stories at least.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Carroll is making one hell of an instant impact. On the edge of the area, just to the left of goal, he cushions a header back to Diame, who pelts a super shot goalwards. It's straight at Schwarzer, though, and the keeper tips over. But only just. The corner comes to naught, but this is very promising indeed from Carroll, who is now worth \u00a336m.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> O'Brien, underlapping (I assume you can't overlap on the inside) down the left, gets near to the byline and cuts a pass back for Vaz Te, who hammers a low shot towards the bottom left. It's not too far away at all. West Ham are looking very, very impressive this morning, as exciting to watch now as they were appalling against Swansea this time last weekend.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Fulham are being restricted to long, overly ambitious shots on goal. Diarra's the man this time, but his effort is lame and left. \"So you want to riff on harrowing scenes from fiction, yeah?\" begins Ian Copestake. \"Well, here's a taster that might be from the end of Junger's Perfect Storm, or might be a reflection on Chelsea's performance: 'For reasons that he still doesn't understand, Hazard didn't quit.He made a guess and swam. The entire port side of the cabin was welded steel and he knew if he picked that direction, he was finished.'\" This riff has to stop now. Not because it isn't any good. It's just that I'm <em>way</em> out of my depth already, one email in.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Duff hares after a long ball down the inside-right channel, and is <em>this</em> close to guiding it across Jaaskelainen and into the bottom left. But misses the ball altogether. Small margins, eh.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> The Carroll-Vaz Te-Nolan combination nearly unlocks Fulham again. Carroll wins another booming header, Vaz Te receives and flicks an instant pass right to Nolan, who very nearly executes a perfect floated chip over Schwarzer. The ball flies just over the crossbar. Carroll now worth \u00a338m.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> It's the Andy Carroll Show. On the edge of the D, he drops a shoulder and is so near from sashaying - <em>sashaying</em> - past Hangeland. But there are limits, and the defender stands firm. Then the big man races after a long diagonal ball, entering the box on the left. He's shoved in the back by Riether. That should be a penalty kick - it'd have certainly been a foul anywhere else on the pitch - but the referee isn't biting. Carroll is now a \u00a340m player, which means Liverpool's crack team of negotiators might be able to get upwards of \u00a33m for him next summer.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Petric sprays a long ball down the inside-left channel for Rodallega, who enters the box, albeit not in total control, spinning through 180 degrees as he does so. His back to goal, he's firmly shoved to the ground by a clanking clunk from Collins. Clumsy Collins. That's just rung a distant Commodore 64 bell. More at half time, you lucky people.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Fulham have been enjoying more possession than West Ham, though they've been doing little with it. This is a better period for them, as they try to draw the sting from West Ham, boring them rigid with a period of patient passing in the centre of the park. Eventually they break forward, and it's yet another shot from distance, this time a low fizzer from Sidwell which is well claimed by Jaaskelainen.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Fulham are pressing West Ham back now, without really threatening them. Duff curls one in from the right, but it's easily dealt with by Reid. Then another ball swung in from the same wing, Rodallega having worked his way out wide, but Jaaskelainen claims.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>29 min: GOAL!!! West Ham United 2-0 Fulham.</strong> A corner for the Hammers down the right. The ball's swung in. With Fulham paying close attention to Andy Carroll, there's space for Reid, who ghosts towards the six-yard box and heads home. Sort of heads home. Well, the ball goes in the net, the ball rolling down the back of Reid's head and ski-jumping off the nape of his neck. Not the prettiest goal you'll ever see, like West Ham give a flying one. Carroll is making a lot of things happen around him.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Fulham were just beginning to work their way back into this match, and now look. On the touchline, a livid Martin Jol, having earlier ground his teeth into dust, is compressing his gums into house bricks.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Vaz Te skedaddles down the right, totally unchallenged. He slides the ball into Nolan, who tries his level best to kick the ball up into his own face. A half-chance spurned.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Carroll has the heat on about some minor clash in the penalty area. He's shoved in the back again by Riether, but this time it's a fair challenge. The referee gets that one spot on. \"I hear you on Berba, Scott,\" begins jazz fan Steven Hughes. \"I like to think of him undergoing his medical this week with fag still in mouth, only being taken out so that he can blow smoke rings into the ether. Also, when the doctor asked him to lift up his shirt, I picture it as one with Rahsaan Roland Kirk's face on it.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Fulham are doing the Passing It About thing again. And once more they're Going Absolutely Nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> A period of play during which West Ham prove they can knock it around pointlessly in midfield as well as anyone else. Big Sam one-dimensional? Oh I don't think so!</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>41 min: GOAL!!! The Andy Carroll Experience 3-0 Fulham.</strong> From deep on the right, Collins clips a long free kick into the area. Under extreme pressure from - who else? - Carroll, Hangeland can only head out weakly to the edge of the area, where Taylor rushes in and skelps a confident finish into the bottom right. Schwarzer was rooted, no chance. This is a brilliant display by West Ham United, but by one player in particular, and he's not even on the scoresheet himself.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Fulham look totally stunned. Duff tries to make something happen down the right, but he's turned back upfield. It's just not happening for them. \"I reckon Big Sam is going to have an extra sugar lump for Andy at half time,\" quips Alan Brown. Cheap, but affectionate. Anyway, Carroll is now officially a thoroughbred. His current value is \u00a345m, which Liverpool should be able to translate into \u00a36m if they get their best men on it.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: West Ham United 3-0 Fulham.</strong> A couple of corners from Duff come to nothing for Fulham, who haven't been abject; they've just been Carrolled. The new hero of Upton Park goes off to warm applause. Penny for Brendan Rodgers' thoughts? You'd probably pay at least a quid now, wouldn't you?</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME RETRO GAMING:</strong> A new feature very tenuously influenced by <strong>CLUMSY</strong> James <strong>COL</strong>l<strong>IN</strong>s' challenge on Hugo Rodallega (21 mins).</p> <!-- Block 34 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W5ZSF6A2HZ0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W5ZSF6A2HZ0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>To be honest, I'd usually get fed up after failing to find the crash helmet. But as a boring old bastard I'm duty bound to say computer games were better back in the day, which they probably weren't. Still, what difference does it make?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Rather unsurprisingly, existentialism's Dimitar Berbatov comes on for the almost invisible Petric. Fulham get the ball rolling for the second half. \"Brendan Rodgers should be applauded for a decision which clearly benefits the player even as it leaves LFC short of a plan B,\" argues Ian Copestake. \"The Yanks however have not backed the manager by denying him a measly 4 million. Pathetic.\" I agree. Carroll was never going to shine at Liverpool, certainly not under Rodgers, like he's doing here today. An unfairly derided figure, Carroll should put a fair whack of the value back on his price tag if he has a good season, especially if he keeps playing like he's doing today. So everyone wins. Liverpool's lack of strikers for this season is another issue altogether. Some real mismanagement during their negotiations yesterday - not coughing the extra few quid for Clint Dempsey was preposterously stubborn - but the club is reaping what it sowed last year, overspending wildly on goods from the second shelf. There's a lot of blame to go round, from the current owners to Kenny Dalglish and Damien Comolli, and nobody (apart from poor Rodgers) comes out of it particularly well.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> West Ham start the half on the good foot, Vaz Te having a dig from a position on the right. It's high and not particularly handsome.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> This half hasn't really started yet. West Ham are under no obligation to do a damn thing.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> A bit of space for Berbatov down the inside-left channel. He's flagged offside as he breaks into the box, a tight and, by the looks of it, unfair decision. Still, whether it would have made any difference if play was left to develop is a moot point, as instead of looking for goal he opts to drag a fairly tame cross through the area, no team-mates anywhere near his pass. \"Berbatov is the football equivalent of James Bond,\" opines Simon McMahon. \"In the sense that he is effortlessly cool and appreciates the finer things in life, not because he is a spy and has killed people or anything. Someone men would like to be, and women would like to be with, if you will.\" And men would like to be with, and women would like to be. We're a broad church here at the Guardian.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> A free kick for West Ham, just outside the area, to the right of goal. Taylor curls a magnificent shot through a gap in the wall created by the lurking Collins, and very nearly foxes Schwarzer. But the keeper gets a hand to the ball.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> And now a corner for West Ham, swung in from the right. At the far post, The Big Man wins a header - Hangeland, attempting to mark him, is all over the shop and panicking quite openly - but Vaz Te can't convert the dropping ball, executing a fresh-air swipe instead. Some other clumsy Hammer has shoved someone over, in any case, and the ref blows up for a free kick.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> A pretty period of passing by Fulham, back and forth across the West Ham area, but the home side hold firm. Richardson nearly prises open some space down the middle to release Berbatov. Rodallega looks to curl one into the right-hand corner. Riise teases a cross in from the left. But all openings are shut off pretty quickly. Both sides can be satisfied with this, in their own way, but Fulham will be the only ones frustrated.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> What this game needs is another striker deemed surplus to requirements by Liverpool! Here's Alexander Ka\u010danikli\u0107, formerly of the Anfield youth set-up, taking the place of Richardson, whose debut has been a bit of a non-event, if we're being harsh.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Corner for West Ham down the left, from which Carroll rugby tackles Diarra. He has the brazen cheek to question what he's done wrong, the mark of a confident player indeed. \"Today's game is a perfect example of why it was right for Liverpool to off-load Carroll,\" suggests Nick Smith. \"He's an incredibly effective target man who will win everything in the air all day long. That gets you a top eight finish. To improve on that you need a subtlety in play that you don't get from having himn in the team and would have to disrupt your set-up to use him as an impact sub. He doesn't suit Rodgers' style so protecting his value and letting him play so he can develop is best all round.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Fulham with more possession, but still no sharp edge up front. \"Berbatov's not just rolling any old fag, you know, he's using a stylish little rolling machine!\" notes Matthew JS. \"No nicotine-stained fingers for our Dimitar! I bet he uses those coloured, flavoured Rizla papers you get on the Continent, too, while the rolling machine probably folds up to look like a snazzy platinum-nibbed pen that he can stash inside his jacket pocket. And you just know he'll roll himself ten perfect little cigarillos and place them inside an embossed metal case, which he'll nonchalantly flip open when a young, female member of a minor European royal house strolls past. Surely the call-up for a Davidoff advert can't be far off?\" I gave up smoking a few years ago, and now I really want a fag. Thanks!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> I really do want that cigarette!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> On the edge of the area, Berbatov brings a high ball down with a yawn, then flicks it back to Rodallega, whose goalbound hoof is chased down by Collins. \"Liverpool have been playing the transfer market poorly for a long time so I can't believe that anyone is surprised that they screwed-up again,\" writes David Wall. \"Even back in the Benitez era, instead of being prepared to pay a little extra to get the genuine quality required to be competitive they regularly paid middling prices (or took free agents so probably had to pay them higher wages) for lots of middling players (or worse, some real dross). Think of Jovanovic, Babel, el-Zhar, Ngog, etc, etc. It's like filling your wardrobe with lots of cheap rags then moaning about being unable to afford some smart threads and using your poverty as an excuse for looking crap. I suppose they tried a different tactic spending big on Carroll, Henderson, and Downing, but after years developing bad taste you can't expect to be able to recognise quality when you see it.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> A double change for West Ham. First Collins is replaced by Tomkins. Then Carroll goes up for a header with Hangeland, only to land awkwardly. He doesn't look totally jiggered or anything, but he's holding his thigh, and limps off to be replaced by Cole. He receives a thunderous round of applause for his troubles as he departs; he's been absolutely magnificent today.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> After some good work by Berbatov, a corner to Fulham down the left. From which a scramble develops. The ball falls to Sidwell, to the left of goal. He sidefoots past Jaaskelainen from a tight-ish angle, but there are several men on the line, and one of these dudes clears the ball. It's just not going to be Fulham's day.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> More of the Fulham passing, to the usual ends. Berbatov and Kacaniklic exchange a couple of neat reverse balls down the left, but there's nobody in the middle to get onto the eventual pass inside.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> A Rodallega shot flies straight down Jaaskelainen's throat. \"So are we all just going to keep talking about Berbatov's cigarette-rolling (or possible texting?) and ignore the questionable earring choices of that bloke sitting behind him talking to young David Hasselhoff?\" wonders Alex Hanton. You mean you've been able to snap your eyes from Dimitar's gaze? Oh Alex! How could you summon such energy?</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Diame has some sort of leg knack, or maybe it's his foot, <em>writes Dr Murray</em>, and is replaced by young Robert Hall.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> This game is petering out. Even the happy Hammers support can hardly raise a quaver of song. \"I like the way the MBM is developing a descriptive style based on the complete absence of any need to refer to players' names,\" writes Ian Copesake (aka Always There Man). \"The Big Lad, etc is clearly recognisable, but am sure some Homeric epithets like the swift footed one, or that clumsy oaf (or the heel destroyer for Charlie Adam), would work as well.\" I did once try to popularise <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/06/championsleague-barcelona\">Galoot as a more snappy monicker for Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107</a>, but it never took. I tried. Hell, I tried.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Cole looks to bustle clear down the middle, but no Big Man he, and Schwarzer is out quickly to hack clear. \"Carrying on the theme of Liverpool Irrationalty (which was planted by Graeme Souness, watered carefully by Gerard Houllier, and blossomed into one healthy self-destroying phenomenon under the tender care of 'Rafa' Benitez and Tweedle Dum/Tweedle Dee so that it even consumed Kenny Dalglish), what bright light thought it best to send Carroll out on loan while retaining Downing and Henderson?\" wonders Lou Roper. \"Surely their combined wage packets exceed Carroll before we even consider footballing reasons? Oh, sorry, Downing is now a left-back, apparently.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Berbatov nearly opens up West Ham with a can-opener twist of his foot, but Rodallega is beaten to the through ball by Tomkins, who prods out for a corner. From which West Ham sweep upfield, first through Vaz Te, and then onto Hall down the inside-left. For a second it looks like a dream introduction for Hall, but he can't get his shot away. \"While I heartily agree with David Wall that Liverpool's transfer policy has been 'like filling your wardrobe with lots of cheap rags,' what are we going to do now that we've actually got rid of the wardrobe?\" quips Always There Man.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Everyone just wants to go home now.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Kacaniklic opens his body in an attempt to guide a shot into the top right, but the effort wafts lazily into Jaaskelainen's arms.

This second half's been a total non-event, though.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Duff gets a yard down the right, and hammers a shot goalwards. Jaaskelainen, who has had the square root of bugger all to do, palms round for a corner. That's the hottest his gloves will have felt all afternoon. And then, like London buses, sort of, more glove heat! From the set piece, Rodallega takes a shot, and the keeper is forced to palm a close-range effort onto the right-hand post! \"Re: 84mins, are Trinny and Susannah still available?\" wonders David Wall. \"Their advice couldn't be any worse than Damien Comolli's.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: West Ham United 3-0 Fulham</strong> The referee brings an end to a worthless 45 minutes of football, though the first 45 were golden for the Hammers. The home side were fantastic, and Andy Carroll immense, as they record their second win of the season and leap, for a couple of hours at least, to fourth place in the nascent Premier League table. Fulham's new signings need a wee bit more time to get to know each other, I would suggest. Finally, an apology to Hammers fans for banging on about Liverpool so much, on an afternoon that's all about you, but then this is what happens when you make off with their \u00a335m striker and then he does <em>that</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Hopes that a Christian girl in Pakistan accused of blasphemy would be released on bail have been dashed, as the case, which has attracted worldwide condemnation, became bogged down in legal wrangling.</p> <p>A judge at an Islamabad court deferred the bail hearing of Rimsha Masih until Monday after it emerged that two separate sets of lawyers were attempting to defend her against charges of burning sacred Islamic texts \u2013 a crime in Pakistan that can be punished by death.</p> <p>The dispute allowed lawyers from the other side to challenge the authenticity of the bail application.</p> <p>In court for the short hearing was Rimsha's accuser, Malik Amad, who claims to have spotted her last month walking near her house in a slum area on the outskirts of Islamabad carrying ashes, which it is claimed included burned pages with verses from the Qu'ran.</p> <p>The desecration of the holy book is regarded as a particularly grave form of blasphemy and can easily spark violent public reactions in Pakistan.</p> <p>Also present was a local mullah, Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti, who has called for the law to be followed to its conclusion, even if that means the girl is executed. As with other members of the Muslim community in the area, he has rejected claims that Rimsha has Down's syndrome or is mentally impaired.</p> <p>Central to the case is the age of Rimsha and whether her case should be heard by the more lenient juvenile justice system. In their bail application, the defence lawyers argue she is 13. A medical report prepared earlier in the week said she was 14 with a lower mental age, although the court has not yet decided to accept the report.</p> <p>Chishti has also been at the forefront of a dispute between the two communities, complaining that Christians in the area were holding noisy services in their churches. He welcomed the departure of nearly all the Christians from the Islamabad neighbourhood in the tense days after Rimsha's arrest, but about half of the families have now returned to the area.</p> <p>\"They have returned, but they are still living in fear,\" said Shamaun Alfred Gill, spokesman for the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance.</p> <p>With the plight of Rimsha attracting international condemnation the case has brought more attention to the treatment of Pakistan's minorities.</p> <p>Murderous attacks against members of the Shia sect are on the rise, particularly in the restive province of Baluchistan. On Saturday the death toll increased again, with seven people gunned down in two separate incidents near Quetta, the provincial capital.</p> <p>Complaints by Hindus have also been mounting in recent months, with families claiming their daughters have been forcibly kidnapped, converted to Islam and then married to their abductors. Parties of Hindu pilgrims were recently detained at the border with India after the government feared they intended to claim asylum and never return.</p> <p>Christians, as well as Muslims, have long suffered at the hands of the country's blasphemy laws. For years rights campaigners have demonstrated how the laws, which ultimately stem from British colonial rule, have been used by individuals to settle scores and economic disputes, often on the basis of flimsy evidence.</p> <p>Despite several ludicrous cases, including the jailing of people for allegedly touching a Qu'ran with dirty hands, public figures are loath to try to reform the system. Two politicians have been assassinated by religious hardliners for criticising the laws.</p> <p>Unusually, Rimsha has attracted support from some heavyweight Islamic clerics, many of them regarded as hardliners. A statement published earlier in the week by Rimsha's father, Misrek Masih, credited the support by the clerics to the amount of international attention the case was getting, which had also forced the attention of the president, Asif Ali Zardari.</p> <p>In an online petition, Masih urged supporters to \"keep up the global outcry on my daughter's case\". The uproar, however, has bemused Rao Abdur Raheem a lawyer for the prosecution, who said Muslims could \"take the law into their own hands\" if Rimsha was not convicted.</p> <p>On Saturday he blamed foreign powers for whipping up support. \"I don't understand the interest of the international community because there are so many innocent people in Pakistan being murdered,\" he said. \"A single drone attack and hundreds of people die. What is the difference between Rimsha and these innocent people?\"</p> <p>Another member of the prosecution team said that even if Rimsha was acquitted she would never be able to return with her family to her home. \"She would not stay in Pakistan,\" said Mohammad Izzat Khan. \"She would be in America within a week.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week, a study <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/27/cannabis-damaging-under-18s-study\" title=\"\">purportedly showed</a> an association, or correlation, between people who became habitual cannabis users when they were 13 and people whose IQ dwindled between the ages of 13 and 38. It also suggested the lack of such correlation for those who first became habitual cannabis users when they were aged 18 or over. Accordingly, one is expected to infer that using cannabis in early adolescence has a detrimental effect on IQ, but doesn't if one begins using it in late adolescence.</p> <p>These findings are likely to be mistakenly adopted by those who advocate continuing the prohibition of cannabis as a justification of their position. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/29/cannabis-reduces-iq?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">But assuming that such correlations are true</a>, it is obviously important that cannabis use takes place within a framework where age limits may be imposed. I have been a dedicated supporter of the relegalising of cannabis since the mid-1960s. Neither I, nor any of the various pro-legalisation organisations with which I have been associated, have ever advocated that legalisation should not be accompanied by age limits and other controls. Age limits for a large number of activities are well entrenched and accepted by society, and tend to lie between the ages of 16 to 18.</p> <p>But there are no age limits in a black market. Neither is there any other form of control. Prohibition is not control, and should not be equated as such. It is the abrogation of control leading to the unregulated peddling of adulterated substances outside the reach of the law. Apart from not beginning to achieve its aims, prohibition makes drugs artificially expensive and spawns an avalanche of acquisitive criminal behaviour.</p> <p>Most drugs, for example cannabis, are either plants or are derived from plants, and most plants are very cheap. But as illegal drugs have to be sold on the black market, those who trade in them risk being sent to prison or fined. They charge a lot of money for their trouble. Some people cannot afford to buy the artificially expensive drugs they want to take and resort to theft. The illegal drug business has become so profitable that people have violent fights over territory in which to sell drugs. They can afford to buy guns. Guns are bad. Once a country is full of people with guns, the guns will never go away. Across the Middle East, South-east Asia, Africa and Latin America, civil war after civil war has been funded by the only strategy available to revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries alike, the mass production of their traditional drugs for sale to the absurdly lucrative global market.</p> <p>Prohibition increases any harm that might be caused by recreational drug use. A recreational drug, by virtue of its inherent chemical nature, cannot cause crime; it can only do so through interaction in a social context, which is prohibition and the consequent black market. Prohibition is a root cause of crime, violence and ill health. It would be difficult to construct, even if one deliberately contrived to do so, a policy more physically dangerous, more individually criminalising, or more socially destructive. Prohibition is a relatively recent social experiment, an extremely dangerous failure, and should be dismantled as soon as possible.</p> <p>Legalisation does not require a set of laws enforceable by only the most totalitarian of police states. It is humane and helpful and no more condones drug misuse than a doctor prescribing a contraceptive condones promiscuity. As such, I welcome the findings of the study as demonstrating the increasingly urgent need to legalise cannabis.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 12,000 visitors to Yosemite national park in California may have been exposed to a deadly mouse-borne virus that has already claimed two lives.</p> <p>The mice nested in the cavity walls of insulated tents and the virus was spread through their faeces, saliva and urine.</p> <p>The company that operates the tents contacted 3,000 people who made reservations during the summer.

  "<p>Girls cheerfully show off their gruesome tribute to heavy metal band Slipknot, Stanley-knifed into their arms or belly. A Belgian army officer demonstrates the most effective way to kill someone with a knife. A Pussycat Doll trainer encourages youngsters working out to take off their clothes.</p> <p>They are of differing seriousness, but all those scenes can be seen in videos that are freely available to buy on the high street or Amazon by anyone of any age, none of which have gone through any classification.</p> <p>The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will this week close a three-month consultation that most observers believe will end a loophole which means DVDs with titles like The Bitch of Buchenwald and Britain's Bloodiest Serial Killers can claim exemption from being given age guidance by the <a href=\"http://www.bbfc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Board of Film Classification</a>.</p> <p>As things stand, most sport, documentary and music videos can claim an exemption from classification. \"The great majority of exempt video works are fine,\" said the BBFC's head of policy, David Austin. \"They are not going to harm anyone, but there are a significant number of titles that are potentially harmful to children.</p> <p>\"We know from our postbag that parents are concerned about exempt videos. Usually they write and say, 'Why did you give this video an E classification?' The answer is we didn't as it never came to us \u2013 it would not have gone to anyone.\"</p> <p>The BBFC estimates that around 200 videos might be caught by a change in the law.</p> <p>Austin showed the Guardian examples of videos that have claimed exemption but would have been classified. They range in seriousness. One of the more shocking is a documentary about the American heavy metal band Slipknot \"which, actually my son bought when he was 10 and I confiscated\", said Austin. \"He's waiting till he's older to get it back.\"</p> <p>It shows one fan who has carved the word Slipknot in to her forearm and another who has done the same in her belly, to which someone is seen pointing in admiration.</p> <p>A music video by the Norwegian black metal band Gorgoroth, which was rated X in Germany but is unrated in the UK, shows topless women being crucified with blood running down their breasts.</p> <p>A Robbie Williams video for the song Come Undone, contained on an exempt compilation, In and Out of Consciousness, shows drug taking and Williams cavorting in bed with two naked women.</p> <p>Videos that can say they are educational or instructional can also claim exemption. That means that one easy-to-purchase close-combat video is exempt even though the Belgian instructor is showing the best way to kill someone with a knife. Matter-of factly demonstrating the best grip, he tells viewers, \"It gets more force when perforating,\" then goes on to show where to put it.</p> <p>Austin said: \"Given concerns about knife crime in this country, that really is how to kill someone. If that came in for classification, we would not classify it \u2013 we would cut that.\"</p> <p>Other potentially problematic DVDs include wildly violent cage fighting DVDs and ones that instruct in krav maga, the combat techniques developed by the Israeli army.</p> <p>Austin said parents also complained about DVDs that are not so clear-cut \u2013 a Pussycat Dolls workout DVD for example, which includes one burlesque routine that would unquestionably make some parents feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>The workout moves include feather boas being passed between the legs, followed by a roll of the head and a \"bite, push, step, slap\" move in which the girls bite their finger, step forward, push out their backside and slap it.</p> <p>The trainer encourages them: \"Really flirty!\" In the next scene dancers in stilettos perform the same moves and viewers are encouraged to take some clothes off.</p> <p>All the signs are that the government will change a law that was made in 1984, when no one could have foreseen a problem with music or instructional videos. The BBFC, together with other regulatory bodies, is calling for exceptions to the exemptions that would cover material that is violent, sexual, discriminatory, has repeated strong language or contains imitable behaviour such as drug use.</p> <p>\"It is completely common sense,\" said Austin. \"We're talking about videos quite legally being sold on the high street, often to children. Some companies do submit them on a voluntary basis, which makes it even more confusing for parents who see on the shelf 18 and 15 ratings and see ones with an E symbol. They then ask: \"Why do you think this is so much milder?\"</p> <p>A DCMS spokesperson said: \"DCMS launched a consultation in May on the exemptions from age rating that currently apply to music, sports, religious and educational videos. The consultation closes on 1 August and government will publish its response in the autumn.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Tara Trilogy is a brand new series which is a combination of Hindu mythology, a modern plot and spooky stuff. The leading protagonist is Tara, a girl of age unknown to us, and Suraj, Tara's brother. The story begins on the night of Diwali. Their evil step-mother Kali slaps Tara for stealing ladoos to feed a starving Suraj. Basically the background of this story is that Tara's mother Parvati and grandfather Prabala (healer of the village) leave the village because of some unruly rumors, leaving Tara and Suraj alone. Their father, Shiv marries Kali (now their step-mother). Kali tortures Tara and Suraj, beats them up and starves them. Tara has half a mind to run away from home.</p> <p>This book is really interesting and every chapter is equally exciting. The sentences are easy to understand and each sentence is a small burst of excitement which makes you want to read on.</p> <p>One day a man named Zarku shows up; he wears a black robe and has a spooky third eye. Zarku persuades the village Panchayat and takes the place of the village healer. Zarku calls himself the best healer in all of India, but Tara can see through this healer and she can see evil. While roaming the village market Tara can see a huge crowd gathered around a dead Vetala. This book is really scary in the chapters including the Vetalas and fights with them. Vetalas are monsters that have appeared in the Kelsar forest, they are bodies of decaying green flesh, have a gash in their forehead which oozes black liquid and their insides are black, and their feet turn at a 180 degree angle.</p> <p>One night Tara, on the way to the temple alone, overhears her step-mother Kali and another unknown person talking about murdering her and Suraj! Tara makes up her mind to escape at dawn with Suraj to the Kelsar forest despite the grave danger. They are not aware that a black cobra is following them. One night Suraj falls ill and Tara prepares a medicine for him but it does not help, and the next morning Suraj is gone, presumed dead. Tara walks on searching for Suraj when she reaches a temple.</p> <p>If you thought the book was interesting so far, this is the part where it starts getting really exciting. The problem is that the middle of the book is so exciting that the climax seems boring compared to these middle chapters. I am not going to give away the plot but I will lead you up to it.</p> <p>Tara quickly hides when she sees a sobbing Zarku holding a silver anklet and talking about his mother! As soon as Zarku talks about finding and killing Prabala, Tara shouts out to Zarku. When Zarku grabs Tara and slams her against a tree, the silver anklet falls into Tara's kurta pocket. Zarku tries to open his third eye to burn Tara but cannot as she now has the protective silver anklet. Tara manages to escape and later runs into Ananth, a boy whose father is dead and mother was eaten by a tiger when she was going to perform Sati.</p> <p>Together they embark upon their journey once again. They need to find the water of life and Prabala to save Morni (thier village) from Zarku's evil clutches.</p> <p>The most exciting chapter in the book is yet to come: the one including lord Yama and the water of life. In some places it gets so scary that a shiver runs down my spine. There are a lot of surprises and the book is filled with adventure and chills.</p> <p>Mahatab Narsimhan has done a really good job giving mythology an engrossing modern plot. Read it for a quick adventurous read. The only problem is that this book answers all the questions, and by that I mean to say that if this was a single book then it would have made no difference, as it leaves no loose ends. Therefore, it doesn't really make you lunge for the 2nd or 3rd book, which I am reading now by the way. I am not sure if I feel like reviewing them. </p> <p>There are a lot of Indian references so you will need to already be familiar with Indian mythology to understand it. </p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site </a>and send us your review!</strong></p>",
  "<h2><strong>Judo: 11am ExCeL</strong></h2> <p>In Beijing Antonio Ten\u00f3rio became the first judoka to win Paralympic gold medals at four successive Games and at the age of 41 he's coming back for No5, having become the first Brazilian male to qualify, with a third-place finish at the Ibsa World Games last year. A genuine Paralympic legend, a documentary about him, B1, named after his -100kg category, was a big hit in 2009 and he remains among the favourites in his 100kg category. He has already received his invitation for Rio 2016.</p> <h2><strong>Shooting: 1:15pm Royal Artillery Barracks</strong></h2> <p>Shooting events are split into two categories \u2013 SH1 for athletes who can support the weight of their firearm themselves, and SH2 for those who require a shooting stand. In this afternoon's mixed R3-10m air rifle prone SH1 competition Britain has the defending champion and favourite, Matt Skelhon, who wore an outlandish mohican when winning in Beijing but has adopted a more sober haircut for his home Games.</p> <h2><strong>Athletics: 8pm Olympic Stadium</strong></h2> <p>Last year Tyson Gay trained with the Irish sprinter Jason Smyth, and admitted that \"his running technique is better than mine\". Today you can judge for yourself, assuming Smith has qualified for the 100m T13 final \u2013 one half of his gold haul along with the 200m in 2008.</p> <h2><strong>Contender: </strong>Sam and Joe Ingram, judo, 4.30pm</h2> <p>One of two fraternal pairs on the GB judo team, both Ingrams will be vying for medals today. Sam, the younger, won bronze in the -90kg category in 2008; Joe did not make it to Beijing but, like his brother, took silver at the 2010 world championships.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Day three: 1 September</strong></h2> <p>The seven-a-side football tournament gets underway, with Great Britain up against Brazil (4.15pm). There's no doubting this will be a tough match, but Brazil racked up 6-0 and 4-0 defeats against Ukraine and Iran in Beijing, so GB will be hoping to start their Games with a win. The defending champions, Ukraine, kick off against the USA (2pm) and the 2008 silver medallists, Russia, face Argentina (9am). On the track, the Irish sprinter Jason Smyth, who trains with Tyson Gay, should make the T13 100m final (8pm) and could grab his first medal of the Games while Matt Skelhon targets gold in the 10m air rifle prone shooting event (qualification 1.15pm, finals 4pm).</p> <h2>Archery</h2> <p>10:00 Men's Individual Recurve -

  "<p>I write this not for sympathy but in search for understanding.</p> <p>I sat in my office, unable to stop crying. I didn't understand why. I had just been given excellent news, for the second time that year I received an outstanding rating from a lesson observation. I took a few seconds of joy from the news, after a short time I began to question the decision. I couldn't have earned the result because of hard work, good planning and execution; it had to be for another reason. The more I thought about it all, the more I convinced myself that there were other reasons for the given result.</p> <p>Everyday your colleagues enter work, some are seemingly happy and confident but in reality they are struggling to maintain the smile. If someone is suffering from a cold then the signs are pretty obvious, it they are suffering from depression it is less so.</p> <p>I have always suffered from low self-esteem. Quite frankly, the feeling of inadequacy has haunted me all my life. I seek the approval of others too readily, when the approval is positive then I seek reasons to dismiss it but am only too eager to embrace the negative. Sometimes, when I'm feeling my most low, I seek to get out of things that might possibly result in negative feedback. I always felt that these feelings were manageable. I could always keep them in check; hide them away behind self-deprecating comments and jokes. This year, I couldn't hide the dust under the carpet anymore, there was so much, it started coming out the sides, the more I pushed it back the more came floating out.</p> <p>Work was becoming increasingly difficult. I'm sure working anywhere and having these feelings is extremely hard to deal with. But working as a teacher makes it harder then most. Imagine performing on stage to a packed house, only the audience isn't the paying public but is fully made up of the most fearsome critics. Throughout the show, these critics give you their review; if it's going well they might let you know but if it's going poorly they definitely will. The rewards can be great but so can the consequences. Suffering the way I do, the need for things to go well is almost overwhelming, when they do the highs are mountainous, when they don't the lows are deep canyons; the highs are fleeting but the lows are long lasting.</p> <p>Trying to hide these feelings was starting to have an impact on my home life. I would spend weekends and evenings preparing work in extreme detail so that it would limit the possibility for failure. I would lie in bed thinking about the areas of a lesson that could fail and skirt over the areas of success. The alarm clock became redundant; you don't need to be told to get up. During my darkest days of the year I would be up a couple of hours before the alarm. As a consequence, I was spending less and less time with the family, which inevitably was having an impact on the relationship with my partner.</p> <p>She could see what was happening and she tried to help me; it was her who suggested I needed help. I eventually accepted the help on offer but it took a long time and only after some long conversations about the future.</p> <p>In late May, I went to the doctor and told him what was going on. He casually informed me that it sounded like I was suffering from mild depression. I can laugh now but telling someone with self-esteem issues that his depression was only mild didn't seem wise. Great, I thought, I couldn't even get depression right! He referred me to a counsellor and within six weeks I was having my first consultation.</p> <p>As it stands, I'm feeling a lot better. The sessions have helped me put things into perspective and I'm finding the joy in things again. However, most of these sessions have taken place during the summer break, a time when teachers are naturally more relaxed about things. I will have a better understanding on how I'm feeling come October half term.</p> <p>I take comfort in the fact that on discussing my illness with other teachers, it would appear that I'm not on my own. Most of the colleagues I've spoken to about this have gone through the same process as myself. Their symptoms may have been different but the diagnosis is the same. It's the same with the cure; I'm trying to overcome mine through counselling others have tried medication. What I'm sure of though, is that all of us started getting well when we recognised the problem and took action to fix it.</p> <p>I write this not for sympathy but in search for understanding.</p> <p><em>Today's Secret Teacher is head of department in a comprehensive school in the south of England.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.
