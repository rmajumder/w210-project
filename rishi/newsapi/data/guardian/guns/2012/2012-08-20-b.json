  "<p>Phyllis Diller, the pioneering US comedian who aimed some of her sharpest barbs at herself, has died aged 95.</p> <p>Diller, who broke into comedy in the 1950s, created an indelible persona with her distinctive braying laugh, cigarette holder, teased hair, outlandish costumes and a fictional lout of a husband nicknamed Fang.</p> <p>A friend and fellow comic, Joan Rivers, said Diller cleared a path for a younger generation of female standup artists to trade on their jokes alone.</p> <p>\"The only tragedy is that Phyllis Diller was the last from an era that insisted a woman had to look funny in order to be funny,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joan_Rivers/status/237639758594076673\" title=\"\">Rivers said on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>\"If she had started today, Phyllis could have stood there in Dior and Harry Winston and become the major star that she was. I adored her!\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joan_Rivers/status/237639932372451328\" title=\"\">she added</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/status/237634493618454529\" title=\"\">Ellen DeGeneres tweeted</a> that Diller was \"the queen of the one-liners\". Whoopi Goldberg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhoopiGoldberg/status/237634800465358848\" title=\"\">called her a \"true original.\"</a></p> <p>Born Phyllis Driver in Lima, Ohio, she was a late bloomer by showbusiness standards, getting her start at 37 in 1955 when she made her debut at San Francisco's Purple Onion and broke into the male-dominated comedy circuit.</p> <p>Diller was a housewife who had raised five children, but also worked as a newspaper columnist, publicist and radio writer. She discovered a flair for standup jokes at school parent-teacher meetings and decided to make comedy a career at the urging of her then-husband, Sherwood Diller, with whom she had five children. The couple divorced in 1965 and a second marriage to singer Warde Donovan ended 10 years later.</p> <p>Diller's act consisted of rapid-fire jokes and one-liners that often spoofed social pretences by poking fun at herself (\"I went bathing nude on the beach the other day; it took me 20 minutes to get arrested\") as well as a world of invented characters including her mother-in-law Moby Dick and her skinny sister-in-law Captain Bligh.</p> <p>TV appearances followed and Diller became an instantly recognised star. She made her movie debut in 1961 with a small part in Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass and played the title role in a 1970 Broadway production of Hello Dolly!</p> <p>Diller became friends with Bob Hope and co-starred with him in three films.</p> <p>In later years, she suffered from heart problems but continued to work in clubs and on TV well into her 80s. She played an insect in the 1998 animated film A Bug's Life, appeared in the 2005 comedy documentary The Aristocrats and voiced Peter's mother in 2006-2007 episodes of the cartoon TV series Family Guy.</p>",
  "<p>It is Monday morning at the Wellington Sports Ground just outside Eastleigh and Michael Appleton's week so far has been plain sailing. The Portsmouth manager has not been obliged to call his senior players together and inform them that, if they do not rip up their contracts, the club will cease to exist. No prospective owners have had second thoughts over potential budgets or ditched their rescue bids altogether. He has not even had to sign up an entirely new side as an awkward league fixture looms large on the horizon.</p> <p>So ludicrous has been life at Pompey since Appleton swapped The Hawthorns for Fratton Park around 10 months ago that the fact the sky has not fallen in on this club is cause for celebration. Portsmouth are stumbling along in their third spell in administration, while the saviours in waiting, the Supporters' Trust, formalise a proposal to be scrutinised by the administrator, Trevor Birch. One of the former owners, Balram Chainrai, withdrew his interest but will still have a key role to play in the months ahead as a major creditor and owner of the club's stadium. The position is precarious, the manager's job virtually impossible. But Appleton does not do doom and gloom.</p> <p>\"There have been times when everyone's morale has been as low as a snake's belly,\" he says. \"I'd be driving into work thinking: 'Jesus Christ, I'm going to be faced with a staff who have hit rock bottom.' So I'd use the 'Superman effect', something [the sports psychologist] Bill Beswick told me about. I'd get out of the car and be, 'Bang, this is what we're going to do today, this is how we're going to do it.' If people see me bright and breezy they'll think: 'If he's like that, I'm all right.' Then you get that bubbly atmosphere going.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you just have to put that poker face on. There have been times when I've been frustrated and asked myself if it's all worth it but I pick myself up. You hear 17,000 fans chanting 'Appleton's blue and white army' and the hairs go up on the back of your neck. Sure, you dread the news from the administrator that 'this is it, the end' but all you can do is control what's controllable. And when I speak to other managers, they tell me everything will feel like a doddle after this.\"</p> <p>His has been a baptism of fire. Appleton arrived from West Bromwich Albion, where he enjoyed a brief spell as caretaker manager, to embark on a five-year plan aimed at establishing Pompey back in the top flight. He had been seeking to create a legacy \u2013 \"build an academy, change the training ground \u2026 it felt the perfect project\". It was a vision shared by the chairman, Vladimir Antonov, but the club's parent company, CSI, slipped into administration. \"The five-year plan lasted 10 days,\" says Appleton. Birch was engaged in February and the inevitable 10-point deduction followed, along with player departures \u2013 Appleton travelled to Barnsley with a squad of 12 \u2013 and the spirited attempt at Championship survival came to nought.</p> <p>Cost-cutting measures prevented Appleton sending players for scans on injuries, prompted whip-rounds to pay for food in the canteen and even had the lawnmowers locked up at the training ground. Wages were deferred and the belt-tightening became ever more painful, but it was the summer that really made Pompey's predicament feel unusual. Birch, working initially to Chainrai's instructions, sought to offload the senior players and their onerous contracts. When his efforts foundered, it was left to the manager to encourage his best personnel, senior players with families and commitments, to leave.</p> <p>\"Management should be about explaining to players they are not playing, not calling them into an office to tell them they have to leave,\" he says. \"But I had to be blunt: 'Look, I don't want you to leave but you have to leave. You'll either get this compromise amount or nothing. Take a hit on what you're owed here and earn a living at another club. Some of my staff won't get that opportunity.' I had to be straight with them.\"</p> <p>The honesty paid off and the decks were cleared, leaving the coach Ashley Westwood and a youth-team squad that exited the Capital One Cup at Plymouth . It was only on Thursday that the Football League, encouraged by the Supporters' Trust takeover bid, sanctioned Appleton to sign a new squad of players on short-term deals, with 10 joining on Thursday and another four on loan 24 hours before Bournemouth visited Fratton Park for the start of the League One campaign. . \"We'd identified 20 players I could work with under the budget I'd been given but, as things dragged on without an owner, and particularly when that proposed budget was cut (by Chainrai), they became anxious. I maybe lost 15 of them. But we'd done our homework and other other options, and I sold them the club.\"</p> <p>\"God knows how I convinced them to come,\" says AppletonAn entire side of debutants \u2013 players who have tasted life at higher levels, such as Brian Howard, Izale McLeod, Jon Harley and Lee Williamson \u2013 were thrust together overnightand drew 1-1 with the Cherries.</p> <p>This is the new Pompey. Where last year the club operated on an annual wage bill of \u00a313m, now the figure is nearer 15% of that. \"We'll have 20 players who earn, combined, what we were giving one player last year,\" says the manager, a reflection of the \u00a336,000-a-week that was being paid to Tal Ben Haim. His budget is the equivalent of a side in the bottom five of League One, which neatly reflects the 2008 FA Cup winners' fall from grace.</p> <p>They take on Colchester United on Tuesday braced for a difficult task. \"Any injuries now and it will be a farce,\" says Appleton \u2013 as if things had not reached that state of affairs already. \"But this remains a fantastic club. It just needs someone to show it a bit of love.\" Until someone does, in Appleton Pompey trust.</p>",

No-one had called him to suggest he drop out, he said.</p> <p>His defiance came in spite of criticism from senior Republicans, including White House challenger Mitt Romney and senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which provides funding for candidates. Barack Obama also denounced his remarks.</p> <p>Both the Republican party and prominent political action committees, known as Super Pacs, said they would withdraw their support. Ad campaigns worth millions of dollars were being scrapped.</p> <p>Akin went on Huckabee's radio show in an attempt to save his position. He said: \"I've really made a couple of serious mistakes here which were just wrong, and I need to apologise for those. There is no such thing as legitimate rape. It's an evil act and it's committed by violent predators.\" He added: \"I've even known some women who have been raped and I know that it's a terrible, terrible thing.\"</p> <p>In spite of the row over his comment that \"legitimate rape\" rarely results in pregnancy, he argued his background and ability made him a big asset in unseating the Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill.</p> <p>Republicans want him to step aside because the row is threatening the White House race, and reduces the chances of taking the Missouri seat, one the party is banking on to secure a majority in the Senate.</p> <p>In a statement, Cornyn said: \"I recognise this is a difficult time for him, but over the next 24 hours, congressman Akin should carefully consider what is best for him, his family, the Republican party, and the values that he cares about and has fought for throughout his career in public service.\"</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, also urged him to rethink his position, describing his comments as inexcusable.</p> <p>Obama, speaking at the White House at a rare press conference, denounced Akin's comment. \"Rape is rape. And the idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we're talking about doesn't make sense to the American people and certainly doesn't make sense to me.\"</p> <p>He said that politicians, most of whom are men, should not be making healthcare decisions on behalf of women.</p> <p>While accepting that Romney had also denounced Akin, he said there was a significant difference between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. \"The underlying notion that we should be making decisions on behalf of women for their healthcare decisions, or qualifying 'forcible rape' versus 'non-forcible rape' \u2013 those are broader issues \u2026 between me and the other party.\"</p> <p>Asked if he thought Akin should quit, he said he had been chosen by the Republican party in Missouri and the decision was one for it to decide.</p> <p>Earlier, Romney used <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/314452/romney-akins-inexcusable-comment-robert-costa\">an interview with the National Review Online</a> to denounce Akin in unusually forthright language.</p> <p>\"Congressman Akin's comments on rape are insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong,\" Romney said. \"Like millions of other Americans, we found them to be offensive.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I have an entirely different view. What he said is entirely without merit and he should correct it.\" But he stopped short of calling for Akin to step down.</p> <p>Republican senator Scott Brown became the first member of the party to call publicly for Akin to resign. \"Rep Akin's statement was so far out of bounds that he should resign the nomination for US Senate in Missouri,\" Brown said in a statement.</p> <p>Brown's response is not surprising, given he is well to the left of the party, fighting to retain his seat in a tight race in liberal Massachusetts.</p> <p>Wisconsin senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ron4Senate/statuses/237582523465596928\">Ron Johnson also called for Akin to pull out</a>. On Twitter he said: \"Todd Akin's statements are reprehensible and inexcusable. He should step aside for the good of the nation.\" </p> <p>His intervention was more significant as Ryan is from Wisconsin and the latest poll suggests Romney has taken a narrow lead over Obama in the state.</p> <p>But even figures such as Karl Rove, George W Bush's strategist, told Fox News that Akin's \"got some real explaining to do\".</p> <p>Barack Obama's campaign team portrayed the comments by Akin as further evidence of what it has dubbed the Republican \"war on women\".&#xa0;</p> <p>The row began when Akin, in an interview with the St Louis channel KTVI-TV broadcast on Sunday,&#xa0;was asked about his opposition to abortion, even in the case of rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>\"It seems to me, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" Akin replied. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something: I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.\" </p> <p>Akin won the Republican primary only this month with the backing of Tea Party groups. The Missouri race, against Democratic Senator Clare McCaskill, was seen as one of the most winnable for the Republicans in its bid to take control of the Senate.</p> <p>Akin is only narrowly ahead in the polls and pollsters predicted his remark is almost certain to lose him a lot of votes, especially among women.</p> <p>But the row could also have implications for the White House campaign as it has focused attention on an area of sensitivity for Romney: the views on abortion of his running mate Paul Ryan. </p> <p>In a statement released after Akin's remarks, Romney's campaign team said: \"Governor Romney and congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin's statement, and a Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.\"</p> <p>But the statement leaves questions about Ryan unanswered. Until the statement was released Ryan had been opposed to abortion even in the case of rape. Ryan was the co-sponsor of a House bill last year called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act that included what it referred to as \"forcible rape\", though the phrase was later dropped after a backlash from women's groups.</p> <p>Romney has an ambiguous record on abortion, promising while campaigning for governor of Massachusetts not to change existing law but adopting&#xa0;a tougher position when campaigning to become the Republican presidential nominee. </p> <p>Ryan, by contrast, has been consistently opposed to abortion in almost all circumstances.</p> <p>Akin's opponent, Claire McCaskill, a close ally of Obama's, said that Akin had not addressed several issues raised by his original comments, including his comment that women's bodies closed down during rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>She called on Akin to apologise for that and other contentious statements, but rather than join the calls for him to quit she warned the Republican leadership that any attempt to oust him as the candidate would backfire. </p> <p>McCaskill, seeking re-election, was widely regarded as vulnerable but her opponent's remarks play into her strategy of painting him as an extremist, provided he remains the candidate.&#xa0;</p> <p>Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the Democratic National Committee, sought to broaden the issue beyond Missouri politics, accusing Republicans of wanting to \"take women back to the Dark Ages\".</p> <p>She added: \"The real issue is a Republican party \u2013 led by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan \u2013 whose policies on women and their health are dangerously wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>'I feel the need \u2026 the need for speed!\" is probably the most famous line from Tony Scott's most famous film, Top Gun (what else?), the movie that made Scott's career and defined the look of commercial films for the late 20th and early 21st century. It is also a line that sums up what audiences loved about Scott's movies, and what critics did not.</p> <p>Despite the diversity of his career, a common thread throughout all his films, from the gleeful highs of Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II, True Romance, The Last Boy Scout and Crimson Tide, to the deadening lows of his first film The Hunger, Revenge and Domino (Keira Knightley plays a bounty hunter \u2013 let us speak no more about it), is the whizz-bang-chop-cut style. His spinning camera shots and tight snickerty-snack approach to editing were derived directly from two of his biggest influences: his years working in TV advertising and MTV.</p> <p>Along with Adrian Lyne, a British contemporary of Scott's who also came to Hollywood via advertising, Scott realised that there was little point in aiming for art when the public wanted what he described as \"something more rock'n'roll\", and looked to the emerging MTV channel for inspiration. But where Lyne was apparently dazzled by the sexual imagery of music videos (Flashdance, 9\u00bd Weeks, Fatal Attraction), Scott was more interested in their pacing and glitz. Not for nothing was he nicknamed by the New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael \"Tony Make-It-Glow Scott\".</p> <p>There are plenty of moments in Scott's films that look more like music videos than movies, the most obvious one coming from (again) Top Gun, with leather-jacketed Tom Cruise on his motorbike, cresting over a hill, sun setting behind him, Berlin on the soundtrack. When he reunited with Cruise for Days of Thunder \u2013 which is best described as Top Gun with cars and a character named \"Cole Trickle\" \u2013 Scott dismissed concerns that there wasn't actually a script until relatively late in the planning game, cackling gleefully, \"Tom Cruise driving a race car, smoking a cigarette? We'll make a fortune!\"</p> <p>One can only speculate about how much Scott's love of adrenaline in films stemmed from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyM54sHC7Co\" title=\"\">Boy and Bicycle</a> \u2013 his brother Ridley's directing debut, made in 1962 but not released until 1965 \u2013 which starred a teenage Scott cycling through Hartlepool, the wind in his hair, a grin on his face.</p> <p>But Scott was no mere schlock merchant. His films provide simple pleasures, but unlike Lyne's, they have held up extraordinarily well. No one would watch 9\u00bd Weeks for fun now; anyone would down tools for Top Gun. True Romance, in which he Scott-i-fied Tarantino's script, remains a delight, and Crimson Tide looks far more current than the movie that won the Best Film Oscar that year: come on down, Braveheart.</p> <p>Unlike his older brother, Scott was never nominated for an Oscar. He claimed this did not bother him, but in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdkzZxsvxCo&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">one recent interview</a> suggested otherwise. Musing on his regular \"crucifixions\" at the hands of critics, he talked about his place in the Hollywood pantheon: \"I'm never going to get an Oscar \u2026 I'm sort of dismissed. I've been scrubbed off the list.\"</p>",
  "<p>I can't say that if I ever were to find myself fighting the Taliban at close quarters in Helmand my first instinct would be to check the \"GoPro\" video camera on my helmet was switched on, so that I would have some home-movie footage to show my friends and family back home when they got fed up watching daytime TV, but I'm grateful there are our soldiers that do. The return of the award-winning <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01175hg\" title=\"\"><strong>Our War</strong></a> (BBC3) for a second series did more to bring home the realities of the war in Afghanistan than any number of news reports or Ross Kemp documentaries.</p> <p>Our War was a detailed account of the three-day \"Kick the Hornet's Nest\" operation by the 100-strong Arnhem Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment in July 2010 to actively engage the Taliban in order to allow the building of the main road \u2013 Route Trident \u2013 to progress with little hindrance. Hearts and minds stuff it wasn't, and what we saw was a gripping hour-long film of the confusion and terror involved in fighting an enemy that you seldom see and are only aware of when you hear the sound of gunfire or an IED explodes. \"I was shittin' meself,\" said one squaddie. Me too, and I was thousands of miles away in London.</p> <p>The bravery of the British troops in Afghanistan has never been in question and it was fully in evidence here; casualties were always going to be a probability in this sort of operation and two men, including the company commander, died of wounds inflicted in battle. More surprisingly on show was the sheer fatigue, as the errors started to mount after three stressful days with little sleep; first, Arnhem company got lost and wandered into a well-marked minefield at night and then it failed to spot that the abandoned fort in which it had taken refuge on the last night was booby-trapped. It was hard not to conclude that at least one of the casualties had been avoidable.</p> <p>And so to the question of judgment. This being a film that had \u2013 presumably \u2013 been sanctioned by the British Army, there were no official recriminations; just the standard comments of \"a job well done in difficult circumstances\", \"a good cause\" and \"paying the ultimate sacrifice\". But unofficially there were plenty: the references to \"an unwinnable war\", \"the army pulling out of Afghanistan in 2014\" and, most poignantly of all, the sergeant from Arnhem company who had left the army after that operation saying he \"just didn't know if it was worth it any more\". As anti-war propaganda, Our War was on a par with anything made by Martin Scorsese or Michael Cimino; and when it's our own army who is making the film it's probably time for the politicians to pay attention and to start covering the armed services' arses rather than their own.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/18/winnie-johnson-keith-bennett-dies\" title=\"\">death of Keith Bennett's mother</a>, Winnie Johnson, at the weekend and the ongoing inquiry into the conduct of notorious \"Moors murderer\" Ian Brady's mental health advocate, Jacky Powell, in regard to a letter that might reveal the whereabouts of Bennett's body, Paddy Wivell's film <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/ian-brady-endgames-of-a-psychopath\" title=\"\"><strong>Ian Brady \u2013 Endgames of a Psychopath</strong></a> (Channel 4) was rather overtaken by subsequent events. Though as Wivell was, in part, complicit in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/17/ian-brady-advocate-letter-moors-murderer\" title=\"\">Jacky Powell</a> witch hunt he might now be regretting his efforts to drum up some pre-publicity headlines for his documentary as it casts some doubt on his partiality. Unless the film was re-edited before transmission \u2013 I viewed it on the morning of broadcast \u2013 there was no mention that Powell claims to have told Wivell that the police had been informed about the letter weeks ago. Nor any examination of the exact legal requirements of a mental health advocate.</p> <p>There again, without these developments there wouldn't have been a lot to this film as it didn't reveal much about Brady that we didn't already know. One civil rights campaigner who had worked with Brady said, \"He was terrifically angry, a very difficult man\", a psychologist reported that Brady's mental health had deteriorated since he had been kept in almost solitary confinement for 18 years, while a religious studies tutor declared his \"psychopathies were noticeable\". Who would have thought?</p> <p>At least these observations were coherent, if not very perceptive. Having spent some time in the first part of the film explaining why Brady was so angry at having been banged up in Ashworth mental health secure unit for so long, Wivell then devoted almost as much time towards the end of the film to reporting how Brady had gone out of his way to con psychiatrists into getting him transferred to Ashworth. One way or another, there lies madness. The whereabouts of his remaining victim isn't the only secret Brady will be taking to the grave.</p> <p><em>And another thing ... Will Martin Tyler and Gary Neville please stop interrupting the football commentary every five minutes to say: \"The Premier League is the best in the world.\"</em></p>",
  "<!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>Full time</strong> Well, what a night. That was a magnificent performance by Everton, who don't usually turn up until some time after Christmas. Sylvain Distin is having to be literally lifted off the pitch by the coaching staff at Everton, such has been the effort put in (and yet, Marouane Fellaini will still be the Man of the Match by some distance: that's how good he was). Bill Kenwright looks as though he might shed a tear. </p> <p>For United, a frustrating start to the season. Shinji Kagawa was their best player, which will cheer Ferguson up at some stage, but their second best player was probably David de Gea. In comparison, Tim Howard the more comfortable evening. Wayne Rooney barely got in to the game.</p> <p>Anyway, it's still only 90 minutes played. Marathon not a sprint and all that. Enjoy the rest of your evening.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90 +4 min</strong> The noise inside Goodison Park is deafening as Everton clear the ball away - anywhere, just hit it! - and the clock clicks over in to the 95th minute. Eventually the whistle blows and a huge cheers erupts: Everton have beaten Manchester United! And on the first day of the season!</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90 +3</strong> Fergie's having a bit of a flounce around his technical area, because the clock is ticking and Everton have even ventured towards de Gea's goal, the cheeky scamps.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>90 +2</strong> Fellaini is subbed off for Johnny Heitinga, the crowd on their feet in recognition of a wonderful performance. The entire bench gets up to slap him on the back, too.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> United work the ball from right to left, back to the middle, out left again, but in the end Anderson can't control Evra's cross. Coleman breaks for Everton, dancing around Evra and then hauled down by Vidic with a tug of the shirt. Naismith replaces Jelavic before Everton take the resulting free-kick, but it's Fellaini who meets it. He loses out in the challenge with Vidic, though. The man with the board says there will be four minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> A bit of a pause as Jelavic gets a cramp-relieving leg massage and the Everton players glug several gallons of sportz drink. The camera operator decides this is a good time to get a close up of Alex Ferguson, who is chewing that gum in double time. It's probably a good thing that we can't see his face as Young shapes the ball straight to Howard.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Cleverley is replaced by Anderson, another footballer wearing the Fat Mohawk that seems to be so popular.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Patrice Evra has twice tried to make headway down the left in the last few minutes. Tony Hibbert has twice stopped him, and twice won a goal kick, to boot. He will be given the freedom of Liverpool in the morning. \"No need for all these sciencey explanations,\" says Niall Mullen, mkay. \"Scholes is a dirtier player than Xavi. He would be in Spain, Germany or on the moon (where Gary Neville could legitimately claim he hadn't faced an atmosphere like that before).\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> Osman is replaced by Seamus Coleman for the final 10 minutes, and receives a warm round of applause for his troubles.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> Great save by Howard! Van Persie, pulling out to the right, manages to pass the ball through Distin's legs for Kagawa, who's bustling in towards the near post. Howard is quickly off his line to block the shot though, sending it ballooning up in to the air and away.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Nani is replaced by Ashley Young. Rooney takes over corner duty and gets the ball into the six yard box, but only so that it can be headed clear by an Everton defender.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> They're prepared to live a little dangerously though! Everton work the ball across little triangles up the middle of the pitch and in the end Vidic takes the ball off his own keeper, hooking it out in front of goal and grateful to see a teammate there just ahead of Gibson, I think it was.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Nani needs a seat on the bench, methinks. Another cross straight at the first defender. Then one straight out of touch. But United are starting to feel... inevitable. </p> <p>\"Let's drop the 'frenetic Premiership' canard,\" says Charles Antaki, rolling his sleeves up and casting a glance towards the tavern door. \"La Liga is pretty physical too, and always has been; the difference is that Xavi is lighter on his feet, more mentally agile, and much more selective than Scholes is in when and how to win back the ball. Which he doesn't lose as much as Scholes does in the first place.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Evra wins a corner when his attempted cross is deflected off Hibbert, but Nani once again passes the ball to the first defender. United are the ones applying pressure at the moment though, with Everton camped in their own half.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> The Everton fans are warned by the stadium announcer that they are not permitted to enter the pitch. It's a bit early to be anticipating a pitch invasion.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> Robin van Persie comes on in place of Welbeck.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Jagielka clears the ball off the line! United had spent a few minutes working the ball around neatly without finding that final killer ball, but eventually Kagawa had a chance. Jagielka raced back towards his own goal in time to fling a leg out behind him and repel the ball.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Sorry, I got distracted watching Fellaini. He's rolling the ball around without even getting up to a jog with socks-rolled-down-nonchalance, but charging about the place when Everton don't have the ball.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>61 min</strong> Nani wins a corner having beaten Baines to a Cleverley ball down the right flank, but Everton will not be moved and hoof it clear. \"I reckon Man City snagged the wrong Toffee,\" says Nathan Woods. \"Fellaini has looked a proper beast the past few seasons and is still on the younger side if I'm not mistaken. Besides, Rodwell simply can't compete with that majestic mop.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>57 min GOAL! Fellaini has put Everton ahead!</strong> From a corner, Fellaini leaps above Carrick - who ends up flat on his face wondering what day it is - and nods the ball forcefully down inside the near post. De Gea could get nowhere near it and Welbeck wasn't on the line in time to get in the way. That goal caps a terrific evening from Fellaini.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Kagawa's passing is lovely, and his first time ball and accompanying run gives Rooney the ball and the space to shoot, but he can't find Howard's goal. \"Ho ho ho!\" chortle the Everton fans.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> Evra, one of the two players on the pitch who actually has 'defender' written in his passport, is not entirely comfortable with the way Osman is harassing him, and it takes a run back towards from Welbeck to stop Everton creating another chance.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Rooney looks to roll the ball across the front of the area for Cleverley, but he's got more ground to cover to reach it than Hibbert, who makes the clearance. This is being played at 75mph now - and in my car, that's terrifying speed.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Off the woodwork again for Everton! Crikey Moses! Osman didn't hesitate to swing a boot at Fellaini's knockdown but sees the ball come back off a rattling crossbar. United are straight up the other end, Welbeck breaking towards the area, but he's dispossessed just in the nick of time by Jagielka.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> Gibson turns Cleverley and, having taken a couple of touches, opts to shoot from about 23 yards out. It's not going to go on any YouTube compilations. \"When it comes down to it, when his career finally comes to an end, there will be those who have been proud to have played against him and/or alongside him,\" says Steve in Antwerp, welling up a little bit as he caresses his Scholes shirt. \"I'd have been been proud to have been scythed down by him any day.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> No changes at half time, so Manchester United begin the second half as they did the first. Except facing the other way.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Everyone thinks different things about Paul Scholes</strong><br>\"Sorry, but you can't compare Xavi's record playing in La Liga with Scholes playing in the much more frenetic and physical Premiership,\" scoffs John Harrison. \"He's still a shit tackler mind.\"</p> <p>\"What Gary Naylor is forgetting is the collection of second yellow cards missing from Scholes' rap sheet as although he deserved them he never received them,\" says Niall Mullen, adjusting his tie and hemming. \"Because he's not that type of etc and so forth.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>My name is Georgina Turner, and I laugh at the Chris Kamara betting adverts.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Attack, attack, attackattackattack</strong> \"After the warning shots of David Silva and Mata last season, this season seems teeming with fast creative wingers who also play through the middle with Oscar, Hazard (Chelsea will be crazy to watch) and Kagawa, Lallana in with Southampton (tbh mainly know him from being great for me on an old football manager), and of course a full season at last for the obvious best of the lot (guess who I support) Hatem Ben Arfa.\" This is from Oliver Lewis. \"I wonder if what is unstated is if there is a lack of quality in full back positions that's been noticed, or if after the amount of bad defending there was last season clubs have decided to just attack more then rather than shore up. Will be fun to watch but perhaps another year of Champions League humiliation? Has any club significantly strengthened their defence? (Vertongen at Spurs may be good exception.)\" I'd say outside of the promoted sides, who have generally tried to strengthen at the back (as well as elsewhere), few sides have concentrated too much energy or cash at the back.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Half time: The Paul Scholes Un-Fan Club</strong><br>\"Paul Scholes is never short of apologists,\" says Gary Naylor, who may or may not be rolling his eyes. \"90 yellow cards in 18 seasons is five per season and this is a forward in a team that wins far more matches than it loses. And there's a few reds too. He is a disgrace for all his skill and off-field down to earthness.\"</p> <p>\"Much as Barcelona's Xavi may laud Scholes to the skies, he's clearly never really tried to imitate him,\" says Charles Antaki, and I think I know where he's going with this. \"For Scholes's 91 yellow cards, Xavi has collected just 20 in his entire career. Oh, and he's a somewhat better passer of the ball as well.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>45 +1 min</strong> Rooney has another chance as Kagawa's ball arrows towards him, about seven yards out from the near post, but he mistimes his leap and the ball boinks off his shoulder for Howard to bat away. It's almost the last action of a half that has whizzed by.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> Vidic concedes a free-kick for a foul on Jelavic, giving Everton a chance to make merry just before half time. It's about 30-ish yards out, just to the right of the goal. Jelavic feigns to take it but it's Baines who strikes it and de Gea makes a <em>ruddy fantastic</em> save to keep it out. He's right across the area the wall should be covering and uses his 'wrong' hand to push it away.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> Everyone watching this match has just puffed out their cheeks and made an abbreviated light sabre noise. Ooohm! What a chance! Fellaini, not for the first, the second or even the 20th time, gets his head to the ball and pops it down into the box, where Osman twists around to hook the ball goalwards. Hard. It takes a fantastic reflex save from de Gea to keep it out.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> A proper chance for Welbeck, that, just about staying on his feet in the tussle with Jagielka long enough to poke the ball towards the far post - it whistles <em>just</em> the wrong side.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> A first chance for Rooney, who hasn't played a huge part so far. The cross from Nani sort of bounced off his knee, away from goal, making it a bit harder to take - he still managed to swivel on to it but couldn't put any pace on it. An easy save for Howard.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Lots of vowel-less harrumphing in the stands as Nani concedes a free-kick without getting booked. They are seeing their side work some lovely combinations into the box, but Baines is just kept from doing any damage by - I think - Vidic.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Everton are swarming all over de Gea's penalty box at the minute, Pienaar seeing his nicely curved shot pushed away by de Gea. They could do a bit better with the aerial balls though - often getting the contact but not getting any direction on it. \"Yes but that's just over three per season average,\" says Louise Gill, of Scholes's yellow cards. \"So not too bad.\" You and your foxing mathematics.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Kagawa is flagged offside to bring to an end a promising United move, though it looked like Distin got the touch through to him. Valencia had no work to do getting the ball off Gibson just outside the area to start that off.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong>... which Rooney attempts to steer inside the left post! It's diverted a couple of yards wide by someone in the wall to give United their first corner.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> According to Opta, Paul Scholes has now collected 91 yellow cards in the Premier League, with only Kevin Davies and Lee Bowyer picking up more. He gets a free-kick of his own just beyond the belly of the D for a clip by Pienaar...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> And now a chance for Jelavic! Everton thread the ball through United's lines at pace, never taking more than one touch, but though the pass through to Jelavic evades the defenders, it's strongly hit and the striker can't get his effort on target. De Gea does have a save to make from Pienaar, mind, pushing his header over for a corner. From that - are you keeping up? - Fellaini spins on to the ball and shoots, but he'd misjudged his position and it's off towards the corner flag.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>23 min</strong> Ooh, Nani wasn't far off with that whipped, dipping effort - wide of Howard's right hand post.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Welbeck wafts a boot at Nani's cross, either to help it on to Rooney, lurking behind him, or to divert it past Howard, but neither happens thanks to that there Everton defender getting in the way. An open game so far, this, breaking from one end to the other - generally at faster pace towards de Gea than towards Howard, but still.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> \"These are difficult days for world weary Evertonians.\" Gary Naylor is here with his Big Book of Everton Gags. It's had a very recent re-print. \"We never expect to get much from Manchester United (except the Cup in 1995), but we can lose by two goals and still be ahead of Liverpool!\" Jelavic looks to beat his marker but loses track of the ball instead.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> A free-kick for Everton from about 18 yards out on the right, now, as Vidic catches Fellaini with a high foot. Baines places the ball and lifts it over the two-man wall, and de Gea comes out to punch it, but only as far as the edge of the area. Pienaar is there, but clicks accidentally in to Tottenham mode and blasts it in to the stands.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Fellaini hits the post! He's a menace at the moment, bouncing off Valencia and rounding Carrick before attempting to scoop the ball over de Gea from an extremely tight angle. Jelavic is unhappy not to get the cutback but it may not have been on - there were other defenders in the box.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Scholes gets booked for upending Gibson, coming straight through the back of him as Everton look to play the ball out. He might conceivably have conceded at least a free-kick a moment ago having caught Pienaar, and far closer to de Gea's goal.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> Phil Neville is covering a fair bit of ground tonight, sweeping across to fill in whenever Baines has gone up the pitch. Nani almost releases Valencia down that side, but Valencia's touch is too heavy and Neville again makes the clearance. United are pushing hard.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Oof, that was a moment. Kagawa played a lovely ball through for Rooney to chase, and he - being whistled by the home fans, naturally - works a yard or two and then cuts the ball back looking for one of those Scholes runs. Fortunately for Everton Phil Neville is no stranger to those and is on hand to clear it. Scholes does get a chance a moment later, and though Howard fumbles it, he's got enough time to scoop it up the second time.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> \"Neville: \"Kagawa will be nervous......he'll never have seen an atmosphere like this\". Well, apart from playing in front of 70,000 screaming lunatics at Dortmund every two weeks.\" Yes, Rob Jacques, I did fear that little piece of commentary might dent membership of the fan club. Kagawa jinks in to the box from the right hand side and stands a cross up towards the back post, but it's too deep.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6 min</strong> Everton win the first corner of the game, just to rub it in, thanks to a surging run down the right by Pienaar and Jelavic. Fellaini, who started that with a flicked header, got his noggin the ball again, but could only help the ball on to Carrick and deflecting away. This is a good start by Everton.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3 min</strong> Nani was furious not to get a corner, mind, and goes charging in to Baines at the first opportunity. Despite Baines asking him not to, the referee books Nani and tells him to calm his rage.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Superb tackle by Distin, catching up to Nani after the winger rolled Baines to chase a de Gea hoof forward and sliding in to poke the ball in to Nani's left leg and out for a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> They're making a right old racket at Goodison Park. Barely able to hear their thought, Fellaini and Jelavic nudge the ball off the spot to get the game going. Everton are in blue and white, playing from right to left. United are in tartan.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Chalkboards</strong> Sky are reporting the United line-up as Cleverley - Kagawa - Scholes behind Rooney - Welbeck - Nani. Works for me.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Eyes forward</strong>. Kevin Mirallas has just been presented to the crowd at Goodison Park, and the players are on their way out on to the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>I need those clippers back</strong>. \"I don't get this Gary Neville love-in,\" harrumphs David Campbell Watson, who's in the mood to dish out a bit of region-based BANTER. \"I can't comment on the depth of his analysis or punditry skills because my brain refuses to acknowledge anything beyond the sound of his nasal Mancy-whiney voice.\"</p> <p>\"I'm far more interested in Gary Naylor's commentary than Gary Neville's,\" says Matthew Sandiford. \"More world-weary Evertonians, please.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Proper football talk</strong> \"That's a pretty impressive back four Sir Alex has there,\" says Rob Hisnay, as his eyes trace Valencia-Carrick-Vidic-Evra a few times, getting wildly dilated. \"So, can United top last season's 1681 man games lost to injury? This injury crisis has been a recurring problem going back to the 1997-98 season. I think they really need to look at their training methods.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Another email. This may be the founding of the Gary Neville Punditry Fan Club. Free clippers with every subscription</strong> \"I'm also *hugely* excited about Neville as commentator,\" giggles Paul E, coyly. \"He raises the standard exponentially over his predecessors and maintains a steady hand when it comes to the supposed bias he would be 'expected' to display. He clearly adores the game and, if anything, more closely resembles the fans than most players-cum-commentators I have ever seen.\"</p> <p>\"Surely I can't be the only one thinking that Neville has spent a long time in the unattractiveness wilderness and it's great to see him reach the Promised Land of being crushed-on?\" wonders Ryan Dunne. \"Being the ''ugly friend'' is surely a gnarly cross to bear at the best of times, but I always felt sorry for the imagined young Gary Neville, out on the pull, being compared to his best mate David Beckham.\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Fergie explains</strong><br>\"Given the expectation, I think that it's better [van Persie] starts on the bench. He's a great player, there'll always be a temptation when you've got a player like that, but I think the sensible route was to start him on the bench.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>An email</strong> \"The thing that excites me the most about the return of football isn't all the new signings and uncertainty and optimism about everyone's fortunes as the season progresses: it's the return of Gary Neville's punditry,\" says James Roberts. \"Am I alone in this? Don't mind at all if I am, I'm comfortable with my Neville-love.\" I think it's fair to say that Neville has tested the elasticity of many a previously-heterosexual man's sense of self since taking up residence in the Sky studio. That haircut though.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>A decade of Wayne Rooney</strong><br>The start of this season marks 10 years since we saw our first of Rooney in a senior shirt - an Everton one (and if you like your omens tenuous, he made his debut in a 2-2 draw with Spurs... 1-1 tonight?). \"I still feel exactly the same about my football as I did when I made my debut,\" he's reported as saying this week. \"I'm still fairly young. I just hope I can play for another 10 years.\" At this point it feels almost obligatory to link to a video of <a href=\"http://youtu.be/ovNbrQ-yVWQ\">That Goal Against Arsenal</a>.

Subs: Lindegaard, Rafael, Anderson, Berbatov, Young, Van Persie, Wootton.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>\"If we start the way we ended last season</strong> we can push the teams who are expected to finish at the top all the way until the end,\" says Steven Pienaar, now back at Goodison Park on a permanent deal. The way Everton ended last season, you'll remember, was by losing only two of their final 16 league games, one of which was the <a href=\"http://youtu.be/o1b-vmvHO3M\">delirious 4-4 draw against Manchester United</a> that turned the subsequent Manchester derby in to a title decider. The trouble is that David Moyes's side has developed a habit of starting the season in exactly the opposite kind of form, losing eight of the <em>first</em> 16 matches in 2011-12. They do have an uncanny knack of getting in United's way, however - scoring two injury-time goals to draw 3-3 at Goodison Park at the start of the 2010-11 season (which was otherwise similarly slow, Everton winning only four games in the first half of the campaign). The signing of Kevin Mirallas was completed too late to allow him to make his debut this evening, and Steven Naismith is not fit to make a first start after signing from Rangers in the summer, but we will see more of the sumptuous Nikica Jelavic.</p> <p>What's that? They're not the debuts you're interested in? Well you'll have to wait, because Robin van Persie is on the bench. Which is good news, because it should mean that Shinji Kagawa can start the game in the position he thought he was signing to play - behind Wayne Rooney - and we'll no doubt get to see Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement present later. In the meantime he will have to put up with supporters in the South Stand getting all Bay-City-Rollers-groupie at the sight of him in gingham. Nemanja Vidic is back in central defence but finds himself partnered with Michael Carrick (who has Antonio Valencia the other side of him) thanks to an outbreak of knack - Rio Ferdinand, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans are all injured. It's interesting to see stats from physioroom.com that say United lost 1681 days to injury last season - more than any other club - while Manchester City lost fewest, with 186. The contrast is quite staggering, especially when you consider that the two were separated in the end by goal difference. </p> <p>Given that the title will almost undoubtedly be contested in Manchester again this year, but for no better reason than that, we should mention City's start to the season: they certainly started as they left off, with the 3-2 win over Southampton an eerily similar one to the harum-scarum win over QPR on the final day of last season that sealed the championship. A superb opening gambit in the cross-town mind games from Roberto Mancini, who has professed United's dominance and given Fergie the chance to assert it all the time knowing the kind of opposition Everton typically present... whether all of this is going on in Mancini's head or my own, I am not sure.</p> <!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Georgina will be here from 7.30pm.

  "<p>When the Bo Xilai issue first erupted in March and the details of Neil Heywood's murder began to emerge, it was commonly accepted that this posed a huge challenge to the Chinese leadership at a most sensitive time \u2013 the imminent change in the composition of the party and government leadership, an event which is surely of greater significance for the world than the forthcoming US presidential election.</p> <p>There was understandable speculation that Bo Xilai's detention could lead to wider rifts in the party leadership that might prove very difficult to manage and which might even lead to the postponement of the forthcoming party congress until the early months of next year.</p> <p>Following the trial of Gu Kailai, Bo Xilai's wife, and her sentencing on Monday, we can now view these events from a different vantage point. Whatever the widespread misgivings about the trial and the closed nature of the proceedings \u2013 and the fact that the whole process has clearly been vetted at the highest levels \u2013 the explanation as to what happened, the verdict and now the sentence has commanded a certain degree of credence. The explanations, though far from comprehensive, are, in the circumstances, more or less plausible: the conflict between Gu and Heywood, the threat to her son, the nature of their financial dealings, and the subsequent murder.</p> <p>Likewise, the nature of the sentence \u2013 a suspended death penalty that could in practice mean a prison term of 14 years \u2013 has been viewed in the west as not inappropriate.</p> <p>After months when it appeared as if the scandal might derail the party leadership, it now appears as if it is once more firmly in control of events. Any wider rifts that might have existed now seem to be under control \u2013 or, more likely perhaps, the ructions following Bo's arrest were rather more limited than some have speculated, though in the absence of any hard information it is impossible to be sure.</p> <p>With the Gu Kailai trial now closed, there remains the key question of what will happen to Bo himself, the overwhelmingly dominant player, without whom Heywood would still be unknown and Gu likewise. Bo Xilai is being investigated for \"serious disciplinary violations\" and it is widely expected that some kind of conclusion will be reached in the matter prior to the party congress.</p> <p>Are there any conclusions that might be drawn at this stage, premature as they may well prove to be? From outward appearances, it seems as if the party is now within touching distance of overseeing a smooth transition to a new leadership, with Xi Jinping as the next president and Li Keqiang as the next premier. This will only be the second time this has been achieved since Mao, the first being the handover from Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao. Similarly wholesale changes in the standing committee of the party, presently composed of nine people \u2013 and the body to which Bo was so energetically and ruthlessly campaigning to be admitted \u2013 are likely to be achieved without too much collateral damage.</p> <p>There has been much speculation that, with China facing a new and difficult set of challenges, the Bo case was likely to become entwined with a range of growing policy disagreements. The difficult policy choices have certainly not gone away but it would appear that the Bo case has been sidelined without it serving to exacerbate the debates that are occupying the present leadership and which will surely dominate the agenda of the incoming leadership. This is no mean achievement.</p> <p>It has been suggested, finally, that the Bo case is the biggest political conflict to have shaken Beijing since the Cultural Revolution. This has always appeared to be something of an over-statement. One only has to think of the prolonged struggle between Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, and Deng Xiaoping after Mao's death to realise that this was a febrile exaggeration. Given the issues that we now know were at stake in their argument, then whatever the present disagreements, they could hardly have been more fundamental or far-reaching than those between Deng and Hua. Deng, after all, was about to take China in an entirely new direction and utterly transform the country in the process.</p> <p><em>Martin Jacques is the author of When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order</em></p>",
  "<p>Gu Kailai, the wife of the disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai, has escaped the death penalty for murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood in a decision that takes the country's leaders one step closer to resolving the biggest political upheaval in decades.</p> <p>A spokesman for the court in Hefei said Gu's \"despicable\" crime deserved the death sentence but it would be suspended for two years because the Briton had verbally threatened her son and because Gu suffered mental impairments that had weakened her self-control.</p> <p>Suspended death sentences are almost always commuted to life imprisonment in China.</p> <p>Experts say the judgment will have been decided high up in the Communist party \u2013 which controls the courts \u2013 as it tries to deal with the scandal surrounding Bo, only months ahead of a once-a-decade leadership transition.</p> <p>While many suspect that Bo's political enemies saw the murder trial of his wife as an opportunity to bring him down, the case has nonetheless cast an unwelcome light on the party elite.</p> <p>Cheng Li, of the Brookings Institution, an American thinktank, said: \"This whole thing is not just about Gu Kailai or even Bo Xilai: it's about the survival of the Communist party and how it can get out of this very embarrassing and threatening situation.\"</p> <p>Coverage was carefully controlled, with Chinese news sites running reports of events from Xinhua, China's official press agency.</p> <p>While there was widespread discussion of the case on blogs, with several users arguing that Gu's sentence was unfairly lenient compared with those given to less well-connected criminals, BBC and CNN broadcasts were blocked.</p> <p>Tang Yigan, the court's spokesman and vice-president, said Gu, 53, regretted her crime and had also provided information about other people's crimes.</p> <p>In a state television clip, Gu appeared calm as she told the court: \"The judgment is just. It reflects the court's special respect to the law, to reality and to life.\"</p> <p>A family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, 33, was jailed for nine years. Tang said it was relatively lenient because he was an accessory rather than the crime's instigator, had confessed and had expressed regret.</p> <p>He Zhengsheng, a lawyer representing relatives of Heywood in Hefei, said: \"We respect the sentence from the court.\"</p> <p>Tang said Gu poisoned Heywood, 41, with cyanide after she and her son, Bo Guagua, had a financial dispute with him in 2011, which worsened when the Briton threatened Bo verbally. But the court found no proof that Heywood had taken action, as Gu's lawyers apparently claimed.</p> <p>The businessman's friends say they fear that he was smeared to justify a lighter sentence for Gu.</p> <p>His death last November in south-western Chongqing \u2013 where Gu's husband Bo was then party secretary \u2013 was initially blamed on excessive alcohol consumption.</p> <p>But two months later Chongqing's former police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the US consulate in Chengdu after breaking with Bo, triggering the scandal. Wang is expected to go on trial soon, though it is unclear what charges he will face.</p> <p>That could be a step on the path towards action being taken against his former boss and patron. Little has been heard about Bo, who was once tipped to join the party's highest ranks, since the announcement in the spring that he was being investigated for disciplinary violations.</p> <p>Some analysts think the party will deal with him internally, pointing out that his name was not mentioned during his wife's trial and that prosecutors focused on the murder without raising issues such as corruption.</p> <p>Bo, a polarising figure, remains popular in Chongqing and his former stronghold of Dalian, and supporters would almost certainly react angrily to a trial \u2013 especially if he did not co-operate. It would also raise questions about how someone with such flaws could reach such a senior level.</p> <p>But Li suggested Gu's sentence might have paved the way for charges against her husband \u2013 first disciplinary and then probably criminal.</p> <p>\"People are already asking, why not Bo Xilai? This is what authorities want: step by step to handle Bo,\" he said. \"But we still don't know whether it will be before the party congress or after.\"</p> <p>In a separate session, four police officers from Chongqing were jailed for between five and 11 years for covering up the murder. The court said they \"faked, hid and destroyed\" evidence to protect Gu.</p> <p>Two British diplomats attended Gu's trial and sentencing in a consular capacity. A spokesman for the British embassy in Beijing said: \"We welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities have investigated the death of Neil Heywood, and tried those they identified as responsible.</p> <p>\"We consistently made clear to the Chinese authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied.</p> <p>\"Our thoughts are with Mr Heywood's family during this distressing time \u2026 our focus remains on offering them all the support we can.\"</p> <h2>Lenient sentence<br></h2> <p>Suspended death sentences have become more common in recent years, with official sources indicating that they exceeded actual death sentences in 2007. But lawyers said Gu Kailai's sentence was nonetheless an extremely lenient one for premeditated murder.</p> <p>\"If the murderer was an ordinary person who killed someone, not to mention killing a foreigner, the criminal would be sentenced to immediate execution,\" said Peking University law professor He Weifang. Well known rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang added: \"Although I welcome this verdict, it doesn't actually stand up from a legal standpoint.\"</p> <p>Analysts suggested before the sentencing that officials faced a political dilemma: too heavy a penalty might be seen as retaliation against the family of a popular official by rivals; too lenient might suggest that those with powerful connections could literally get away with murder. Although suspended death sentences are almost invariably commuted to life imprisonment, few of those who receive them die in prison. Joshua Rosenzweig, an independent human rights scholar in Hong Kong, said one study showed such sentences usually resulted in the criminals serving between 14 and 24 years. Gu might also be eligible for medical parole, but would have to wait two years for her sentence to be commuted and then serve a minimum of at least seven more years.</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another housing report. This time it is Policy Exchange, the prime minister's favourite thinktank, <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/ending-expensive-social-tenancies\" title=\"\">urging the sale of social housing in more expensive areas and the reinvestment of funds to build more homes</a>. The idea makes sense economically \u2013 but living next door to one such house, I would not like to see further stratification of our society. It would not help the country's cohesion.</p> <p>As so often with housing, this is sticking plaster politics \u2013 dealing with symptoms rather than cause. Be under no illusion as to the scale of the crisis: there are said to be 5 million people waiting on registers, but well under half the number of new homes we need being built. This is ruining life for countless families, squashed into inadequate properties, and paralysing possibilities for a generation in their 20s. It will get worse: last month's census figures revealed not just a growing population but a baby boom.</p> <p>This shortfall is why another report last week found average <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/17/house-prices-rise-faster-wages?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">house prices nearly doubling over the last decade</a> and rising three times faster than salaries. They are now approaching eight times average earnings \u2013 twice the multiple on which mortgage companies offer. This is not is just a London problem: the 10 places where the affordability gap increased fastest include Basildon, Burnley, Calderdale and Corby.</p> <p>Little wonder \u2013 as Nick Clegg admitted in one of the general election debates \u2013 the cost and availability of housing is the issue raised most when politicians leave their ivory towers. Yet the slightest hint of changes to planning legislation sends parliamentarians into panic. This weekend we saw Tory MPs warning they would oppose moves to unpick the planning deadlock, while conservative and liberal newspapers alike, so vocal demanding bold action to revive the economy, prepare fresh campaigns to fight reform.</p> <p>Despite mostly living in urban areas, Britons adore the bucolic vision of their green and pleasant land, as displayed to the world in Danny Boyle's Olympic opening. Many foreign visitors commented on the lovely touch of wildflower meadows by the stadiums. But while <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/research/reports/planning-in-a-free-society\" title=\"\">surveys show most voters think more than two-thirds of their country's surface area has been concreted over</a>, an idea promoted by campaigning green groups, less than one-tenth of England is in urban development and almost half this is gardens and parks.</p> <p>If we want to resuscitate the moribund economy, we must recognise the impact of our anachronistic planning laws. It is not just that they drive up house prices to unaffordable levels. They reduce quality, with too many flats and smaller properties rather than the family homes most in demand, while shortages of supply increase price volatility, drive up business costs and reduce employment. <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/growthCommission/documents/pdf/contributions/lseGC_SERC_planning.pdf\" title=\"\">One study in Reading</a> found the net cost of constraint was 4p in every pound of income for local families.</p> <p>The coalition tried to tackle this during its initial \"Maoist\" phase, running into a predictable firestorm of protest led by the country's most powerful \u2013 and most comfortably middle-class \u2013 pressure groups. Despite this, ministers cut some red tape and forced through new rules that presume in favour of sustainable development. Now they plan another assault to spur growth, seeking to encourage building on thousands of already-approved sites and drive through more development.</p> <p>Unfortunately, much like the need to close hospitals to create more community health services for our ageing society, this is one of those issues where everyone wants action but no one is prepared to confront myopic nostalgia. Political constraints mean ministers must nibble around the edges of planning reform when we need perhaps 5m new homes over the next two decades. This leads to mistakes. One reform under discussion is to lift impositions of community benefits on developers; instead, these should be increased to overcome objections from Nimbys while improving services for the old, disabled and poor.</p> <p>There is a very obvious solution staring us in the face. Nearly half of England's land is protected. This includes wonderful national parks and important sites of special scientific interest. But the majority is green belt, that sanctified stuff of suburban dreams. It is time to start building on this misnamed land that is constricting our economic \u2013 and often environmental \u2013 needs.</p> <p>Established after the war, the bands of green belt restrict supplies of land in cities, forcing developers to push beyond them into the countryside and commuters to travel further to workplaces. Created to prevent urban expansion, they are often far removed from our arcadian visions. Some 60% are given over to intensive farming, the rest encompassing gravel pits, quarries, railway embankments and even parts of Heathrow airport. Meanwhile, playing fields are sold to developers and, as Policy Exchange revealed, London alone lost the equivalent of 22 Hyde Parks in front gardens \u2013 often far more biodiverse than pesticide-laden industrial farms.</p> <p>The best brownfield sites have been built on; many of the rest are exorbitantly expensive or ill-suited to development beyond squeezing in more flats. The four towns with the fastest-growing affordability gap between earnings and prices \u2013 Oxford, Cambridge, London and Bournemouth \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/statsblog/2012/may/14/housing-economist-paul-swinney\" title=\"\">all have one thing in common</a>: green belt. Freeing up just 1% of green belt could provide space for 300,000 new homes. Instead, outdated planning policies penalise the most successful and productive parts of the country. Do we want to lose more playing fields, see more garden-grabbing, cram more families into the wrong properties, dash more young people's dreams and watch more landlords get rich at our expense from soaring housing benefit? If not, it is time to send the bulldozers into the green belt.</p>",

Assange strongly denies the allegations.</p> <p>\"Even taken at its worst, if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100% true, and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don't constitute rape,\" Galloway said. \"At least not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it. And somebody has to say this.</p> <p>\"Woman A met Julian Assange, invited him back to her flat, gave him dinner, went to bed with him, had consensual sex with him, claims that she woke up to him having sex with her again. This is something which can happen, you know. I mean, not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion.\"</p> <p>Lawyers and anti-rape campaigners said Galloway was wrong and the law is clear that consent is required every time someone has sex.</p> <p>Galloway said he was speaking out because \"a reign of intellectual terror has descended in Britain\" on this issue and he believed the sexual assault claims were part of a \"setup\" intended to deliver Assange into the hands of the US authorities angered at his publication of state secrets.</p> <p>\"It is staggering just how ignorant, factually and morally incorrect George Galloway can be,\" said Katie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales. \"It is very concerning that an elected MP should display such ignorance of the law for all the women and men he represents. It sends a negative message to all the women and girls who have experienced sexual violence and a disturbing message to perpetrators. He says he doesn't believe these women or these allegations and that is a very powerful statement because every woman or girl who has made an allegation of sexual violence deserves to have that treated fairly.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/Misc/2011/5.html\" title=\"\">magistrates court has already ruled</a> that: \"What is alleged here is that Mr Assange 'deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state'. In this country that would amount to rape.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.html\" title=\"\">high court also ruled</a>: \"It is clear that the allegation is that he had sexual intercourse with her [woman A] when she was not in a position to consent and so he could not have had any reasonable belief that she did.\"</p> <p>In his broadcast Galloway said: \"Some people believe that when you go to bed with somebody, take off your clothes, and have sex with them and then fall asleep, you're already in the sex game with them. It might be really bad manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said: 'Do you mind if I do it again?.' It might be really sordid and bad sexual etiquette, but whatever else it is, it is not rape or you bankrupt the term rape of all meaning.\"</p> <p>Sandy Brindley, national co-ordinator for Rape Crisis Scotland said Galloway's comments were \"very unhelpful\" and supported an enduring but false notion of \"real\" or \"serious\" rape.</p> <p>\"It can be just as devastating to be raped asleep by someone you know as it is to be raped by a stranger in the street,\" she said.</p> <p>Assange remains holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge, as he attempts to avoid extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning over sexual assault claims. The lawfulness of a European arrest warrant issued by the Swedish authorities was <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/22.html\" title=\"\">confirmed in May by the UK's supreme court</a>.</p> <p>Assange and his supporters believe that if he travels to Stockholm he may be rendered to the United States and charged with espionage for publishing leaked military logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and highly classified diplomatic cables from US embassies around the world. They fear he faces life in prison, or even the death penalty in the US.</p> <p>On Twitter, Galloway reacted dismissively to the uproar surrounding his remarks.</p> <p>\"Oh how this 'liberal' chorus of Pavlovian reaction must delight the Pentagon!\" he tweeted. \"Oh my, what a lot of 'liberal' useful idiots the Empire can count on. It's about WIKILEAKS stupid...!\"</p> <p>In a characteristically hectoring broadcast, Galloway also addressed allegations made by the second woman against Assange, over which he is wanted for questioning.</p> <p>\"She claimed that while she did have consensual sex with him, the condom ripped and yet he continued to do it,\" he said. \"Now you wouldn't just need to be in the room with the two of them to know the truth of this allegation. I don't want to take the biology too far, but you would actually need to be somewhere located inside the woman to know if that allegation were true. And if it were true, is it rape?\"</p> <p>The Respect MP concluded by declaring: \"I think the whole thing is a setup. I don't understand how so many of you can't see that. If he did these things, he's a rat. But the United States empire, the British empire, the imperial system that around the world is slaughtering human beings by the million, cutting their throats, starving them to death, leaving them to die of poverty and avoidable disease in their millions, is a much bigger rat, no? Imperialism is a much bigger rat than Julian Assange, no? So why would you want Assange to be delivered to the United States and silenced for ever, unless you were on the side of empire.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Department for Education put pressure on a council to allow building on a school playing field for the creation of a free school.</p> <p>Government officials warned that if the playing field was not given up, education secretary Michael Gove would seize school premises earmarked for children with special educational needs.</p> <p>The Hillock Lane playing fields in Warrington had been used by a secondary school that closed this summer, and is now used by local sports clubs. Internal council documents show that there was pressure from the DfE to provide space for the <a href=\"http://www.kingsleadershipacademy.com/\" title=\"\">King's Leadership Academy</a>, a free school opening in September, which emphasises \"the building of strong character\".</p> <p>The free school backers' preferred site was the closed high school, which has been set aside for two special schools. Government officials initially looked into the idea of the free school sharing these premises with the two special schools.</p> <p>But at a meeting in April, officials told the council that they would submit a planning application to build premises for the free school on the playing field land. Although no longer used by the closed Woolston high school, the land is regularly used by children's football and rugby teams.</p> <p>The council document notes: \"The key risk in not supporting the request from the DfE for the council to lease the land \u2026 is that the DfE would then seek to secure the Woolston high school site for use by the King's free school, using the powers given to the secretary of state that came into force in February this year.\"</p> <p>The DfE said that subject to planning permission, the school will take up a tenth of the total site.</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/32/schedule/1\" title=\"\">Academies Act</a>, passed soon after the coalition government was formed two years ago, the education secretary can seize unused school land owned by local authorities and transfer it to academies and free schools. The council document says this legislation gives the DfE the power to \"stop or at least significantly delay plans to the detriment of special educational needs students\".</p> <p>The official guidance on school playing fields, laid down under the last government, says that even unused pitches should not be sold off where they may be of use to local communities.</p> <p>But the current government is increasingly concerned about the need to provide more school places to meet rising numbers of pupils. After the council approved the use of the playing fields, it was congratulated by the schools minister Lord Hill, who wrote: \"With this in mind, I have resolved not to use the secretary of state's powers under the Academies Act 2010 to secure the Woolston community school site for the free school.</p> <p>\"I am confident that the King's free school will enhance parental choice and help to raise local standards, in line with the overall aims of the free school programme.\"</p> <p>Of the 35 applications for school playing areas to be sold off since May 2010, 30 of the schools were from Tory council areas, four in Labour-run authorities, and one Liberal Democrat, the Labour party said.</p> <p>A DfE spokesperson said:</p> <p>\"There is real demand from local parents in Warrington for high quality secondary provision. Sir Iain Hall and a group of local parents have created the Kings Leadership Academy to meet this local need. Subject to planning permission, the new school will be built on a small part of Hillock Lane playing fields \u2013 a large site of around 15 acres. Subject to planning permission, the school will take up as little as a tenth of this site. The school is looking to make these facilities available to the public for continued community use.\"</p> <p>The free school will open in the premises of a disused infants' school in Warrington before transferring to the playing field site in 2014. The school is for children aged 11-18 and is due to open with a planned first-year intake of 120 pupils.</p> <p>The coalition has come under intense pressure in the past fortnight over its investment in school sport. While British athletes have shone at the Olympics, ministers have been embarrassed by revelations about the scale of playing field sell-offs. Gove has also been criticised for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/14/school-sports-fields-government-olympics\" title=\"\">relaxing regulations that set out the minimum outdoor space</a> schools have to provide pupils for team games. The initially bipartisan approach to the issue has become increasingly fractious.</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/19/tories-biggest-sellers-school-playing-fields\" title=\"\">Labour released figures showing Conservative-led councils have been responsible</a> for selling six times as many playing fields as other parties.</p>",
  "<p>Weather that makes it too hot to sleep is not a traditional aspect of the British climate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/18/hottest-day-of-year-so-far\" title=\"\">but it's boiling hot in Europe and looks to be heading this way now</a>. Many of us in the south of the country have already been caught unprepared this weekend \u2013 honestly, who knew? \u2013 and are, as a result, completely exhausted. So how do you get a good night's sleep in the baking summer heat?</p> <h2><strong>Open the window</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>This may seem obvious, but if you haven't tried it in a while, you may find your window difficult, if not impossible, to prise open. It might be painted shut. You may have lost that little key to the burglar-proof lock that keeps the sash from opening more than 2in. Think carefully about which windows you do open: this is prime weather for robbing houses.</p> <h2><strong>Engage in breeze management </strong><br></h2> <p>If you want cooling air flowing past you, you'll need a cross-breeze. Along with your windows, jam open any connecting doors, peel back all curtains, prop open the cat flap.</p> <h2><strong>Take the duvet out of the duvet cover </strong><br></h2> <p>Sleep under the cover, instead.</p> <h2><strong>Don't move </strong><br></h2> <p>The trick to keeping cool is staying still: once&#xa0;you're in bed, remain absolutely motionless. Impress the utmost importance of this rule on anyone who shares your bed. Tell them the future of your relationship depends on it.</p> <h2><strong>Get a fan </strong><br></h2> <p>Make sure it's the kind that rotates from side to side, the better to rake the length of you with blasts of electrically generated wind. And make sure it's quiet; you'll want it inches from your head.</p> <h2><strong>Think about bills</strong><br></h2> <p>Your future employment prospects, the perilous state of the economy, stupid things you have recently said or done while drunk. This should help you break out in a nice cold sweat.</p> <h2><strong>Still too hot to sleep? </strong><br></h2> <p>Check to make sure the central heating is off. You may well have switched it on one freezing night back in June, and forgotten all about it.</p>",
  "<p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/11/nhs-spending-sleeping-pills-50m\" title=\"\">15.3 million NHS prescriptions were made</a> for sleep medication. Patients in England alone received 5.4m prescriptions for zopiclone and 2.8m for temazepam, the two most popular sleeping pills. According to the <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Economic and Social Research Council</a>, one in 10 of us now regularly takes some form of sleeping tablet.</p> <p>But last week, a leading sleep specialist \u2013 Kevin Morgan, professor of gerontology at the University of Loughborough \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/insomniacs-should-be-given-therapy-not-sleeping-pills-8057372.html\" title=\"\">argued that the NHS should be looking beyond sleeping pills</a> and training its staff to provide psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to help those with insomnia. Morgan argues that CBT offers a better long-term solution, and that sleeping pills hold further dangers: addiction or dependency, medication-related accidents, and spiraling costs for the health service.</p> <p>So how easily can we be weaned off them? Our desire to medicate ourselves in this way is part of our wider preoccupation with sleep. Sleep is perhaps only rivalled by sex in terms of our concern about how much we get, how much we want and how we go about doing it. Earlier this year, when <a href=\"http://www.nuffieldhealth.com/\" title=\"\">Nuffield Health</a> reported that UK adults \"miss out\" on 378 million hours of sleep a week, their respondents averaging 7.1 hours a night, they stressed that this figure was \"much less than the recommended eight hours\". The idea that we might not be attaining the desirable number of sleep hours fuels further sleep anxiety.</p> <p>In 2006, Forbes magazine published an article called <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0227/080.html\" title=\"\">The Sleep Racket</a>, detailing the billions we spend on mattresses, pillows, herbal sleep-aids, soothing room-spritzers, bath-soaks and other products each year. Increasingly businesses are capitalising on our worries about what might happen if we don't get enough sleep. We will, it seems, get fatter, quadruple our risk of stroke and increase our chance of a car accident. Recently, the <a href=\"http://www.aasmnet.org/\" title=\"\">American Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> reported another impact of sleeplessness \u2013 it causes a spike in white blood cells to rally the immune system, in much the same way as the body reacts to high stress.</p> <p>The effect on the body is noticeable even after a single restless night: brain-scan research at the <a href=\"http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/\" title=\"\">University of California</a> showed that the amygdala, the area of the brain responsible for emotional response, overreacts when shown disturbing or upsetting images. This emotional stress soon translates to physical stress, which affects the immune system and leads to inflammation; the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/\" title=\"\">American Heart Association</a> found that sleeping under six hours a night causes inflammatory substances in the blood to increase by 25%, as well as raising blood pressure and heart rate and affecting glucose levels. If this is maintained for some time, it can result in hardened arteries and increased risk of infection.</p> <p>In light of this, are sleeping tablets really so terrible? Might they work to simply realign our sleep patterns, to break the vicious cycle of the insomniac? \"They do have a place in treatment,\" says <a href=\"http://www.sleeping.org.uk/Current_Committee.aspx\" title=\"\">Dr Andrew Hall</a>, consultant in sleep disorder medicine and a member of the British Sleep Society, \"especially for an acute problem, such as a grief reaction, when it may be a humane act to prescribe them.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-nutt\" title=\"\">Professor David Nutt</a>, director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit at Imperial College, goes further: \"The hope is you knock people back into the routine of sleep,\" he says. \"Some people, whether for genetic reasons or stress, have persistent trouble sleeping, and some of those people need sleeping pills in the long term.\"</p> <p>Yet for all our increasing reliance on medicated sleep, there lingers a residual social suspicion of sleeping tablets \u2013 fired, perhaps, by the memory of barbiturates (usage of which only began to dwindle in the 70s and 80s) and of the zombified \"mother's little helper\" image of Valium.</p> <p>It was in the early 1950s that a Polish immigrant named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/oct/03/health.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Leo Sternbach</a> was employed as a researcher at the headquarters of drug company Hoffman-LaRoche in New Jersey. The postwar US had displayed a considerable appetite for anti-anxiety medication, and Sternbach had been charged with the task of creating a copycat version of Miltown, the most-popular anti-anxiety drug of the day. Sternbach instead decided to devote his time to pursuing his own investigations. It was four years before he and his colleagues felt they had found something of note, and tested the new drug on laboratory mice, observing the creatures' behaviour when placed at the bottom of a sharply inclined screen. Previous experiments had shown that un-drugged mice tended to clamber up the screen with ease; drugged mice were likely to slide back down the screen to join their equally sluggish comrades at the base. With the new drug, researchers noticed that although the mice also slid back down the screen, at the base they remained quite normal and responsive. Sternbach's discovery of benzodiazepine would transform the realm of sleeping tablets from the crude mechanisms of its predecessors.</p> <p>The first commercially available benzodiazepine drug was named Librium, and was approved in 1960, though it was soon eclipsed, three years later, by his improved version: Valium, which became the biggest-selling drug in America between 1969 and 1980, with 2.3bn sold in 1978 alone. \"It's quite a good drug,\" Sternbach told the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/06/16/030616ta_talk_paumgarten\" title=\"\">New Yorker</a>, at a 40-year anniversary party thrown in Valium's honour. \"It has pleasant side effects. It's quite a good sleeping tablet, too. That's why it's abused. My wife doesn't let me take it,\" he added tellingly.</p> <p>The science of sleep medication has evolved since the work of Sternbach. Temazepam \u2013 along with flurazepam, loprazolam, lormetazepam and nitrazepam, is part of the modern class of benzodiazepines. Zopiclone is one of a group of medications known as Z drugs \u2013 zaleplon, eszopiclone, and zolpidem (better known as Ambien), which are not benzodiazepines, but function in a similar fashion, reducing the length of time it takes the patient to fall asleep and extending that period of sleep. Where they ace benzodiazepines is that they do not affect \"sleep architecture\" \u2013 that is the structure and pattern of sleep, and the duration of REM and non-REM sleep. Benzodiazepines reduce deep slow-wave sleep, so that we do not wake feeling particularly rested. Neither group of drugs are designed for long-term use.</p> <p>Ian Singleton is 65, and a senior project worker at <a href=\"http://www.btpinfo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Bristol Tranquilliser Project</a>. The project helps an estimated 250 people a year, about half of whom are dependent on Z drugs. Singleton himself became dependent on benzodiazepines in the 1980s, having visited his GP about recurrent stomach upsets and work-related stress. \"My doctor diagnosed stress,\" he recalls. \"But he didn't ask why I was stressed, he just said he would give me drugs to help me get back to work.\"</p> <p>At first Singleton thought the drugs might be helping. \"I felt not too bad for about a month,\" he remembers. \"Then I could feel the effect wearing off. I got pains in my body, terribly tight stomach muscles, and I was panicky. I knew after a year that I was hooked.\" The effect was devastating. \"It completely wrecked everything,\" he says. \"I couldn't sleep, I had anxiety, I had no interest in life. I felt like a bomb ready to go off.\"</p> <p>Singleton went cold-turkey, experienced an epileptic fit and was hospitalised for several months. \"I would never advise anyone to take sleeping pills,\" he says. \"Unless they have been through a traumatic event and the doctor has prescribed them for three or four days.\" There is always, Singleton argues, a reason why people don't feel able to sleep. \"Drugs should only be prescribed when everything else has failed.\"</p> <p>It costs the NHS around \u00a350m a year to keep us in sleeping pills. The demand has risen since the dawn of the recession. In May, the <a href=\"http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">NHS Business Services Authority</a>, which pays pharmacists for prescriptions, revealed a 10% increase in prescriptions in the east of England over the past four years, at a cost of an extra \u00a37m annually.</p> <p>This is a great deal of money for a medication that may not be as effective as we hope. Although most patients believe they accrue an extra 50 minutes of sleep by taking them, the <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/\" title=\"\">American Journal of Public Health</a> reported that Z drugs increase our sleep by a mere 12 minutes. There are other concerns, too. In February, <a href=\"http://www.scripps.org/news_items/4169-scripps-study-finds-higher-death-risk-with-sleeping-pills\" title=\"\">BMJ Open published perhaps the most alarming argument against the use of sleeping tablets</a>. An American study compared 10,500 patients taking prescribed sleeping pills with 23,000 patients not on sleep medication. Although the absolute risk of death remained quite low, it was four times higher in those taking sleeping tablets.</p> <p>\"What was new in our paper was information about association with mortality and cancer of specific drugs, including the agonists zolpidem, zopiclone, the older benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and dipheniramine,\" says <a href=\"http://www.scripps.org/physicians/6510-daniel-kripke\" title=\"\">Dr Daniel Kripke of the Scripps clinic in California</a>, and the report's lead author. \"They all appeared associated with seriously increased mortality. All appeared associated with cancer also. One of the disturbing things about our data was that even taking fewer than 18 doses per year appeared associated with excess mortality.\"</p> <p>He is keen to stress that much of this was seen in patients who had other co-morbidities such as obesity, suggesting the possibility that such conditions might interact with the dangerous effects of hypnotic sleeping tablets. Kripke is adamant about the implications of his research, though: \"I conclude that none of the drugs we were able to study are safe enough to use,\" he says, \"and all should be avoided, even for occasional use.\"</p> <p>Professor Nutt is sceptical of this research. \"There's been very little evidence over the last 60 years that these sleeping pills do any harm,\" he insists wearily. \"Do I think sleeping tablets are a good thing? I sure do. People who criticise them don't treat people with insomnia \u2013 people who haven't slept for weeks and it has destroyed their life. It can drive people to depression, to suicide, to take more dangerous drugs, like alcohol. Insomnia is a serious illness.\"</p> <p>He concedes there may be drawbacks to long-term use: \"People don't get addicted to sleeping pills, but they do get dependent on them, and so they may experience poor sleep when they stop taking them. Part of that is chemical, and part of that is because they haven't addressed the underlying problem that has been affecting their sleep; they've just been wallpapering over it.\"</p> <p>Last year, the Mental Health Foundation reported that 37% of people claim to suffer insomnia, and just 39% describe themselves as \"good sleepers\". So how to remedy our sense of disjointed sleep? Perhaps the first step is to consider how we define good sleep. Nuffield Health's mention of the \"recommended eight hours\" is something of a nonsense \u2013 some people simply don't need as much sleep, while others may need more. The important point is to learn one's own rhythms and requirements. It may even be soothing to remember that the idea of a solid eight-hour block of sleep is a relatively recent invention \u2013 previous generations were at ease with the idea of a waking hour in the middle of the night, when people would read, chat, have sex. Around the 19th century, indeed around the&#xa0;time when sleep became increasingly medicalised, we lost touch with this idea of a two-part sleep.</p> <p>\"The best approach to&#xa0;sleep&#xa0;problems is good&#xa0;sleep&#xa0;hygiene,\" says Hall, \"which means how you organise your&#xa0;sleep: no over-stimulating activities too late at night, no computers or television, exercising earlier in the day, a little alcohol sometimes but not too much, and nothing with pilot lights, or bleeping, or things telling you that you have new messages in the bedroom.\"</p> <p>The shift in thinking towards treatments such as CBT aims to empower patients, enabling them to take control of their own sleep problems, and save the long-term costs of sleeping tablets. The <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm\" title=\"\">Department of Health</a> says it has assigned \u00a3400m over the next four years to improving access to this kind of talking therapy.</p> <p>CBT works on the basis of understanding and manipulating the two processes that affect an individual's sleep \u2013 first, the learned behaviour of spending too long awake in bed trying to get to sleep, and second, the thinking that accompanies that time, which can become panicked and obsessive. Morgan argues that a mere five hours of CBT can deliver benefits in more than 70% of cases. \"It gives a better quality of sleep up to a year later. Thirty years of sleeping tablets have created passivity, the idea that it is out of your control.\"</p> <p>That has to be a positive aim. After all, this is not only about health, about increased risk of mortality, stroke and obesity; it is also a matter of whether we want to spend our lives like Sternbach's laboratory mice, forever sliding sluggishly back down a steeply inclined screen.</p> <p>Even so, sleeping tablets are perhaps not quite the demon we have long painted them to be. They may offer a vital tool in helping the chronic insomniac function, or a simple solution to stop a period of disrupted sleep escalating into something more desperate. As the banner that hung above the heads of those at the Valium 40th birthday party read: \"Thanks for the happiness and relaxation you have given us over the years.\"</p>",

  "<p>The increase in tuition fees, due to rise to up to \u00a39,000 at many universities from this year, was widely expected to be a game changer for higher education \u2013 a prediction borne out by independent analysis of the coalition's controversial reform, published last week. The report \u2013 carried out by the Independent Commission on Fees chaired by Will Hutton, principal of Hertford College, Oxford \u2013 showed a drop in the number of university applicants in England of 8.8% this year \u2013 representing some 15,000 \"lost\" students, who might otherwise have been expected to apply for a place on a degree course.</p> <h2><strong>Francesca Wellman, 18, </strong></h2> <p><strong>Winstanley College, Wigan</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades: </strong>A*AB</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>ABB</p> <p><strong>Destination: </strong>Apprenticeship at Aldi supermarket</p> <p>I got offers to do English and theology at several universities, including Glasgow and Leeds, but earlier this year, I began to question my decision. Having watched friends leave university with degrees and struggle to get jobs, I just kept thinking \"Is it worth leaving university with \u00a345,000 debt, only to end up stacking shelves?\"</p> <p>Some friends and teachers were shocked when I said I'd withdrawn my Ucas application. They were even more surprised when I told them I'd landed an apprenticeship at Aldi, starting on a wage of around \u00a35 an hour. Ironically, I'll be stacking shelves and working on the checkout to start with, but by the end of the three-year training programme, I'll be an assistant store manager on a good salary, which I think will put me streets ahead of any recent graduate.</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Knight, 19</strong> </h2> <p><strong>Prior Pursglove College, Guisborough, North Yorkshire</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades: </strong>CCC</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>CCC</p> <p><strong>Destination: </strong>Running own business in magic and children's entertainment</p> <p>I started doing magic when I was about 11 and joined the Young Magicians Club [the junior section of the Magic Circle] a few years later. I'd show people tricks in the playground at school \u2013 often drawing quite a crowd around me \u2013 which made me realise I could earn some money out of my hobby. At 15, I started performing at shows, corporate events and parties.</p> <p>I did consider doing a performing arts course at university, but I didn't think it was worth it. A lot of my business comes through word of mouth, so going away to study would mean starting afresh in a new town or city. Not only would my income fall, I'd also be getting into debt for a qualification that wouldn't guarantee me any extra work.</p> <p>Although my income varies, at busy times, like Christmas, I can earn \u00a3300 for a couple of hours' work at a corporate do. Some of the most successful magicians can earn up to \u00a370,000 a year. I like the idea of going to university, but I'm not sure it would benefit me in the long term. I'd much rather concentrate on growing my business.</p> <h2><strong>Asha Ajab Mohamed, 18 </strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Tower Hamlets College</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades:</strong> BTec level 3 diploma in business D* D* D (equivalent to A* A* A at A-level)</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>D* D* D</p> <p><strong>Destination: </strong>Paid internship at KPMG</p> <p>The increase in tuition fees definitely put me off doing a degree. Although my parents said they were happy to support me as much as they could, they are already helping my older brother through his university studies. I didn't want to burden them.</p> <p>I applied for a one-year paid internship at KPMG, thinking I didn't have much of a chance as I'd heard they get hundreds of applications for each place. Luckily, Tower Hamlets has a mentoring programme and I was linked up with a guy who works at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who talked to me about City life, helped me with my CV and gave me interview tips. I couldn't believe it when they offered me the job. No one in my family works in the City, or anything remotely like it, so I'd never have got that help otherwise.</p> <p>I'll be working in their risk consultancy department on a salary of \u00a316,500 and I'm hoping it will open doors for me and may even lead to a full-time job. I'm a bit sad that I'll miss out on the fresher's week experience and the social side of university, but partying costs money and no one is guaranteed a job at the end of their degree any more. I'd rather be building up my career.</p> <h2><strong>Gloria Arias, 18</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Reading College</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades: </strong>ABC</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>ABC</p> <p><strong>Destination: </strong>Foundation course in art and design at Reading College</p> <p>The increase in tuition fees has definitely made young people think much more carefully about going to university. I was offered a place at Sussex University to do media production, but withdrew my application because I wasn't 100% certain that was what I wanted to do. If fees were still around \u00a33,500, I'd have been tempted to give it a try for a year, but there was no way I was risking wasting up to \u00a39,000 on a course I wasn't sure about.</p> <p>I decided to do an art foundation course because it's something I'm interested in and there are no tuition fees for under-19s. After that, I'll probably get a job and save up some money to travel. I haven't ruled out university completely, but if I do go, I want some savings behind me, which will probably mean working for a couple of years first.</p> <h2><strong>Michael Jones, 18 </strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Winstanley College, Wigan</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades </strong>BBC</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>BCD</p> <p><strong>Destination: </strong>Engineering apprenticeship at Network Rail</p> <p>From the minute I started A-levels, I felt the expectation from my college was that I would go to university. I did think about it, but I'm more interested in earning money to be honest. I started applying for apprenticeships at the beginning of this year, and after a tough recruitment process that included aptitude tests, team-building activities and a formal interview, I was offered a three-year apprenticeship at Network Rail starting next month.</p> <p>I'll start on a salary of around \u00a310,000 but food and accommodation are provided. It rises to \u00a318,000 by the third year and \u00a320,000 when I finish the training programme. I'm not worried that I'll miss out on the university experience; For the first nine months, I'll be doing residential training at a naval base in Portsmouth with around 200 other apprentices, which will be like a mini university campus. I really feel like I've got the best of both worlds.</p> <p>I was a bit disappointed with my results. I got a D in economics, which was one of my strongest subjects \u2013 but because I have a job lined up, I don't think it will make too much difference in the long run.</p> <h2><strong>Amy Grange, 18 </strong><br></h2> <p><strong>St Monica's high school, Prestwich</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades: </strong>ABBC</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>CDDD</p> <p><strong>Destination:</strong> IT apprenticeship at CapGemini</p> <p>I had my heart set on university and was offered a place at Manchester to study psychology, but when I thought about the amount of debt involved, I started to get cold feet. The tipping point was realising that I could still be paying off my student loans well into my forties.</p> <p>I started the programme last month and have spent the last few weeks on a residential induction course in Telford with 14 other apprentices. Once I pass my probation period, I'll be sent to work on projects around the country. All training is paid for by the company and, if I complete my apprenticeship successfully, I may even be able to progress to a degree course.</p> <p>No one in my family has been to university, so it would have been nice to be the first, but I do feel I've done the right thing. I was a bit disappointed with my results, which were lower than I expected, but at least I'm already in a job and have the chance to prove myself to my employers.</p> <h2><strong>Adam Slater, 18</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Allerton high school, West Yorkshire</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades: </strong>BCC</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>ABB</p> <p><strong>Destination: </strong>trainee accountant at RSM Tenon</p> <p>I've always enjoyed working with numbers, so accountancy seemed like a good career choice for me. But when I looked into it, I realised there was no real advantage in going to university as you still have to take professional examinations before you can practise as an accountant \u2013 even if you have a degree. I decided I'd be far better off trying to get a job and working my way up from there.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to land the first job I applied for at an accountancy firm. The starting salary is \u00a310,500, and I've been awarded a scholarship to cover the cost of the AAT accounting exams [vocational qualifications for the accountancy profession]. There is a stereotype of accountants being boring and sitting hunched over a calculator all day, but that's so wrong. A big part of the job is communicating with people and that really appeals to me.</p> <p>Although I did better in my A-levels than I expected, I still feel I have made the right decision. A lot of young people go to university for the social life and don't think about what will happen at the end of their course. Most degree courses don't lead into a job or profession, so many graduates end up having to do more exams or training anyway. By the time my friends are leaving university, I'll be at least three years ahead of them in my career.</p> <h2><strong>Ben Blake, 18</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Cornwall College</strong></p> <p><strong>Predicted grades: </strong>BCD</p> <p><strong>Actual grades: </strong>CDE</p> <p><strong>Destination: </strong>Travelling around Australia and working for the family bakery business</p> <p>I thought about a law degree, but most of the universities I looked at wanted near-enough straight As. As I wasn't confident of getting those grades \u2013 or sure I even wanted to go to university \u2013 I decided to take a gap year. The plan is to travel around Australia and use the time to think about my next move.</p> <p>My parents have asked me if I'd like to take on the running of their bakery. I've been working there for years now and think I'd really enjoy the challenge.</p> <p>University used to be seen as the only route to a decent, well-paid career, but I think that is changing. Working in our family business, I've not only learned practical skills like making bread, cakes and confectionery \u2013 I've also developed a good grounding in business. These are transferable skills that I could use to get work anywhere in the world. In the long term, this could be far more useful than having a degree. I'm a bit gutted with my grades, though, particularly getting an E in law, which was really unexpected.</p>",

  "<p>Libyan security officials say they have arrested 32 members of an organised network loyal to the country's deposed leader, Muammar Gaddafi, in connection with explosions that killed two people in the capital on Sunday.</p> <p>The car bombings, which were the first fatal attacks of their kind since Gaddafi's overthrow and death, took place near interior ministry and security buildings in Tripoli on the eve of the anniversary of the fall of the city to rebel fighters.</p> <p>Ambulances and firefighters rushed to the scenes of the blasts, while a large numbers of police were deployed to cordon off the sites and remove the charred vehicles and other debris.</p> <p>The first bomb blew up near the interior ministry's administrative offices in Tripoli but caused no casualties, security sources told Reuters.

There should also have been a new president and speaker but, in a transition process that has taken a year longer than the original 2011 deadline, the international community has had to lower expectations.</p> <p>For now, the oldest member of parliament, the former army general Muse Hassan, has been inaugurated as the interim speaker to oversee the political wrangling in weeks to come.</p> <p>The switch from the UN-backed leadership structure known as the transitional federal government (TFG), which ruled for eight years, to this new phase has been characterised more by selection than election.</p> <p>All the MPs vowing loyalty to the country's provisional constitution have had their names put forward by 135 traditional elders and been vetted by a technical selection committee in an attempt to ensure they are educated and gender balanced. The constitution demands that 30% of MPs are female; so far it is closer to 20%.</p> <p>The vetting process is also intended to exclude warlords, who have long been agents of chaos in the Horn of Africa country. The 27 Somalis and nine international observers on the committee said they had fended off telephone death threats and turned away brown envelopes of encouragement.</p> <p>The optimism of the moment is therefore qualified. \"It's a defining time in Somalia,\" said Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, chairman of the Peace and Development party. \"The playing field is not level and I'm not saying Somalia will get what it deserves, but it will be better than the status quo.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, two press conferences reflected the rhetoric of the process to date. An array of diplomats and UN officials painted an upbeat picture, claiming their efforts to steer Somalia's troubled transition back on course have succeeded, and brushing aside fears that there have been many false dawns before.</p> <p>\"It's going to be a qualitatively different parliament than anything you've seen before,\" said Augustine Mahiga, the UN special representative to Somalia. \"It's certainly the beginning of legitimate, representative and accountable institutions.\"</p> <p>But the Somali president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, has accused the selection committee members of overstepping their bounds by not including those he felt should be MPs.</p> <p>As a morning drizzle fell on inauguration day, rumours of protests and security worries circulated by text message.</p> <p>UN officials confirmed a quiet meeting was held between Mahiga and the president in an attempt to smooth things over, but the uneasy truce has left a sense of trepidation on the streets of Mogadishu.</p> <p>Abdi Fatah, a former parliamentary official who is now an aid worker, said: \"We're fearing that if he doesn't win, the president won't give up his palace. And his people \u2013 his clan \u2013 may do demonstrations in the streets.\"</p> <p>Some external observers have condemned the regionally brokered and UN-backed roadmap as deeply flawed. The International Crisis Group said: \"The current political process has been as undemocratic as the one it seeks to replace, with unprecedented levels of political interference, corruption and intimidation. The end of the transition roadmap process \u2013 a that is supposed to usher in an inclusive political dispensation\u2013 may fail to bring stability.</p> <p>\"Convening an incomplete parliament and electing a contested, tainted leadership in Somalia's polarised political environment could easily unravel the painstaking humanitarian, political and security progress made in the past three years. The extremist Islamist movement al-Shabaab is down but not out, and it is evolving, and plots to take advantage of the resulting chaos to regain power.\"</p> <p>Those benefiting from the capital's economic rebirth say the flow of investment, reconstruction and good intentions is fragile, and political instability could destroy all they have achieved.</p> <p>While the composition of decision-makers in the fledgling assembly is a mix of old timers and new faces, some analysts warn it could simply perpetuate an ongoing power struggle between the TFG speaker, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, and the president.\u00ac</p> <p>It has turned into a numbers game. The magic number is 4.5, a formula that acknowledges the primacy of Somali clan loyalties, ensuring that the spoils of power can theoretically be divided between the four main groups \u2013 the Hawiye, Darod, Dir, and Rahaweyn \u2013 and the \"others\", an amalgamation of smaller clans.</p> <p>In coming days and weeks, the full 275-member parliament, a number divisible by 4.5, will vote for a speaker in a secret ballot, to be followed by a similar process for the presidency.</p> <p>But one new MP, Sahra Korrshell, 58, smiled with quiet pride as she explained that she had responded to the call of her clan, the Darod. She gazed over the sea of faces and reflected: \"It's a hard task ahead, but change is good. When new people come, they do things differently, and that's what Somalia needs now.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"It's really nice to create something rather than just consume \u2013 so many people just use other people's stuff,\" says 12-year-old Milo Piccini Noble. Keen to show off the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe\" title=\"\">tic-tac-toe</a> game he has made, Milo challenges me to beat his computer. I fail miserably. \"Perhaps I should adjust the level,\" he says kindly. \"It took me a week to make, and I put in three difficulty levels.\"</p> <p>Milo is one of six young people aged 11-17 ensconsed for five days amid laptops and wires in an office at <a href=\"http://www.spikeisland.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Spike Island</a>, Bristol's arts and media hub. It's where Mark Wales, from the web development company <a href=\"http://www.smallhadroncollider.com/\" title=\"\">Small Hadron Collider</a>, has volunteered to teach coding skills as part of the nationwide summer coding camp <a href=\"http://www.youngrewiredstate.org/\" title=\"\">Young Rewired State</a>, now in its third year.</p> <p>Three days in, the group has already created a program that uses the height and weight of each Olympic competitor to work out their body mass index and see what proportion are technically underweight, overweight and obese. Today they are pulling data from the web to create a medal table that updates automatically.</p> <p>Is coding difficult? \"Initially, but only because it is very strict,\" says Alexi Siddiqui, 14. \"There's just a lot to remember,\" adds his friend, Ben Coleclough, also 14. \"But when you've made something, it's yours,\" nods Alexi. \"You can share stuff you've made on the internet,\" adds Jack Baron, 12. \"Or your stuff can be linked.\" Having other people showing that they like his work clearly makes him feel good.</p> <p>These young people are ahead of the game. Learning how to use Microsoft Office is of little interest when, as Alexi says, it's more satisfying to \"make things to find out how it works\". But they're in a minority. In an O2 survey of 1,000 young people carried out this month for the Guardian, just a quarter said they had learned any computer coding at school \u2013 33% of boys and just 17% of girls. Only 6% said they had had a go with a <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi</a> \u2013 the credit card-sized device that has been heralded by many as the great hope for coding.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/a00199693/use-of-ict\" title=\"\">national curriculum for ICT</a> has been suspended as of this September after the education secretary, Michael Gove, said it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10036637\" title=\"\">\"demotivating and dull\"</a>. In September 2014, the DfE intends to publish the new ICT curriculum at the same time as the revised curriculum for other subjects. But in the two years till then, how are children who have poor access to computers and computer science expertise in school going to be served, when teachers, it seems, are now struggling to understand what they should be teaching in this subject area?</p> <p>It's been just over six months since the Guardian teamed up with Google to launch its campaign promoting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/series/digital-literacy-campaign\" title=\"\">digital literacy</a>. This followed criticism from Google's chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/26/eric-schmidt-chairman-google-education\" title=\"\">Eric Schmidt</a>, that the ICT curriculum gave pupils no insight into how software is made. Other voices in industry still agree: last week Mike Short, president of the <a href=\"http://www.theiet.org/\" title=\"\">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a>, said that computer science must be taught as a subject in schools or the UK could lose its globally competitive position.</p> <p>However, teachers are increasingly anxious that without official guidance on what children should be learning, they may do things wrong. \"Teachers' confidence varies to a large degree,\" says Nigel Hooton, ICT leader at St Peter's primary school in Romford. \"[It] will depend on who is in your school. Teaching ICT is a statutory requirement, but there is no more official statutory programme of study. I think there may be a bit of a vacuum.\"</p> <p>Some teachers who have the skills are already using their newfound freedoms. Darren Kelly, curriculum leader for ICT at Blatchington Mill secondary school in Hove, has written a curriculum for his key stage 3 pupils. But he acknowledges that his school has unusually high numbers of teachers with some form of computing background. \"There is some alarm in other schools that they don't have this kind of skill,\" he says.</p> <p>Even for Kelly, who works in a specialist ICT school, the fact that there is no statutory guidance on what to teach is \"very daunting\". \"You do expect some framework and guidance to follow,\" he says. \"We could get to 2014 and find that everything we've been working on is not what they want us to do.\"</p> <p>Another serious concern, says primary ICT adviser Jodie Lopez Collins, is that though schools already confident in their skills may fly, \"the gap will widen between them and those that aren't\". The suspension of the ICT curriculum and Gove's accompanying vision of pupils learning to program \"ignores the fact that the majority of teachers aren't able to teach digital literacy in any depth,\" she says. \"And the schools that aren't doing very much will think they don't have to bother because there are now no defined requirements.\"</p> <p>Lopez Collins believes teachers are being poorly served by messages about ICT that are wildly at odds with other directions they have to follow. \"Gove and [Nick] Gibb talk about embedding ICT across the curriculum,\" she says, \"but when you look at the new literacy and numeracy framework, it seems to be going backwards; just a couple of mentions [of ICT] but not giving it a fundamental role.\"</p> <p>Learning to code should not be an end in itself, says Conrad Wolfram, founder of <a href=\"http://www.computerbasedmath.org/\" title=\"\">Computer-Based Math</a>, who is judging the final projects made by Young Rewired State participants. \"I've argued that programming should be part of the primary maths curriculum,\" he says. Learning to code should be seen in the same way as learning the skill of handwriting so children can then use it as a tool for solving problems in a wider context. At a deeper level, he says, children need to \"learn to conceptualise the problem they're creating the code to solve. It's actually very creative.\"</p> <p>There has been some progress, says Peter Dickman, engineering manager at Google who advises the <a href=\"http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Computing At School</a>, a grassroots organisation of teachers, supported by industry and academics. \"Exam boards have been producing new [computer science] GCSEs, put together this year since the Guardian/Google campaign started,\" he says.</p> <p>For teachers who are desperate for some support in what they should be doing, Computing At School offers a detailed programme of study created just last year for KS3 and KS4. \"It's not the only way,\" he acknowledges, \"but it is an option.\"</p> <p>Industry, naturally, is entering the fray as schools try to work out a plan. Last month O2 piloted its first Think Big school in Leeds, a day-long event that gave 40 pupils aged 14-16 the chance to create websites and use technology to dream up new business ideas. Google is funding 100 teachers on a six-week computer science training course through <a href=\"http://www.teachfirst.org.uk/TFHome/\" title=\"\">Teach First</a>.</p> <p>Lopez Collins knows what she'd like to see in the revised curriculum: \"We need ICT embedded in the other curriculums, that you have to have completed certain tasks, and there is a more evolved computer science option,\" she says.</p> <p>However, she warns that the teaching skills simply don't exist yet on the scale required to deliver this in every school. \"I worry that I see job ads for computer science/ICT teachers that say you also have to be the business studies teacher \u2013 it goes back to it being all Word, Excel and PowerPoint.\"</p> <p>Come 2014, Dickman says, he'd like to see \"not too much prescription, lots of constructive guidance and lots of useable examples, because it's not reasonable to expect a teacher with a full teaching load to completely rewrite all their materials.\"</p> <p>With support, young people are often happy to teach themselves. Back at Spike Island, the children look surprised when asked how they manage if they get stuck. \"Most of the time I look it up on the internet,\" says Jack.</p>",
  "<p>Is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/jewish-settler-attack-terrorist-us-palestinian\" title=\"\">US state department's decision to label extremist settler violence as \"terrorist\"</a> going to make the Israeli government more likely to enforce the law to protect Palestinians? Those diaspora Jews already critical of Israel's trajectory will surely doubt it. But is the Israeli government really bothered by the doubts of Jewish critics abroad?</p> <p>The fact is that Jewish diaspora support is vital for Israel, whose governments have taken that support for granted for decades, exploiting it to bolster the country's international position. But they also treat Jewish communities as subservient to Israel by claiming to speak and act on behalf of Jews everywhere. Were that support to weaken dramatically and Jewish diaspora critics of the Netanyahu government's policies become dominant, Israeli officials privately acknowledge that the state would face an unprecedented crisis.</p> <p>While this outcome is far from realisation, fear that growing Jewish criticism could seriously challenge Israel's assumption of Jewish solidarity is a principal reason why the country is devoting resources to strengthen Jewish support, in close collaboration with Jewish communal leaders and pro-Israel advocacy groups worldwide.</p> <p>One method of achieving this is to make it harder for Jews to criticise by accusing them of disloyalty, succumbing to \"Jewish self-hatred\", and being \"fellow travellers\" of antisemites \u2013 spurious and groundless charges. Jewish critics with radical ideas for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2013 particularly those who stress there is a Jewish moral obligation to support Palestinian rights and that this is in Israel's own interests if it wants to be a genuinely democratic state \u2013 are subjected to a process of vilification, demonisation and marginalisation. Since such Jews often describe themselves as being outside the organised Jewish community, ostracising them has been effective.</p> <p>The Jewish establishment in the UK \u2013 which includes the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council, the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre, the Zionist Federation and numerous private groupings of the great and the good \u2013 is highly experienced at this. I saw it happen in the 1980s when communal leaders sought to make life impossible for the small but highly active radical Jewish Socialists' Group. And I became a target for such treatment myself when I was appointed head of the influential <a href=\"http://www.jpr.org.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">Jewish Policy Research</a> (JPR) thinktank for a second time in 2005, an experience I recall in my book The Making and Unmaking of a Zionist.</p> <p>By then I had served the community professionally for 26 years. A Zionist for decades, I was one no longer. But I wished passionately that Israel would become a democratic state for all its citizens, end the occupation, recognise the Palestinians' right of return, and acknowledge that Israel's establishment in 1948 was a Nakba, a catastrophe, for the Palestinians. I had no intention of using JPR as a platform for advocating these views but rather made one of my principal aims creating space for Jewish critical thinking and debate about how Jews should relate to Israel, to its policies towards Palestinians and to the serious impact of its actions on European Jews. I believed that only through open and civil discussion of these issues could the necessary change in diaspora Jewish opinion occur.</p> <p>But those who thought my views were beyond the pale had other plans for me. As head of one of the community's major institutions, I represented far more of a danger than so-called marginal Jews. Brazen efforts were made to prevent my appointment, and then, once hired, to force me out. Prominent public figures staged high-profile resignations from JPR's board. Communal leaders secretly sought to silence me and undermine JPR's work. After three years, I concluded it was impossible to carry out my responsibilities effectively, and at the end of 2008 resigned.</p> <p>In the four years since then, has anything changed? Is it any easier for critics to find a receptive communal audience? There are reasons to think it should be. <a href=\"http://www.jpr.org.uk/publications/publication.php?id=235\" title=\"\">A 2010 survey of Jewish opinion in the UK</a> revealed that while 72% described themselves as Zionists, 74% opposed settlement expansion and 35% said Jews should always feel free to voice public criticism of Israel. New \"pro-Israel, pro-peace\" groups that support a two-state solution and an end to occupation have emerged. Even one of British Jewry's most senior leaders \u2013 Mick Davis, chair of Britain's largest pro-Israel charity and CEO of the mining conglomerate Xtrata\u2013 criticised Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, questioned some of Israel's policies, and called for criticism to be voiced freely throughout the community.</p> <p>But even as opportunities for expressing dissent appear to have grown, rightwing Zionists staged a media-savvy fightback, using the usual accusations of disloyalty and \"giving succour to our enemies\", especially targeting liberal Zionist Jewish critics. The latest charge is \"'<a href=\"http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/the_debate_on_jew_washing_beyond_ideology\" title=\"\">Jew-washing</a>', Jews using their Jewishness to give token cover for [boycotting Israel] and even antisemitism\" \u2013 a calumny, itself redolent of antisemitism, promoted by the Israel-based, rightwing NGO Monitor. Spearheading this crusade is an assortment of columnists, bloggers and thinktankers of an aggressive and apocalyptic mindset who smear their targets to the edge of actionable defamation. Even Mick Davis was attacked and has since been tellingly silent. Many leading Jewish communal professionals I know have grave doubts about Israel's direction but censor themselves for fear of losing their jobs, funding or establishment support.</p> <p>Yet attacks on Jewish critics are becoming desperate, for obvious reasons. Even many liberal Zionists are demonstrating their support for a \"selective\" boycott, aimed at shunning everything to do with the Jewish settlement enterprise in the occupied Palestinian territories. So, too, are some prominent Israelis, including Avraham Burg, the former speaker of the Knesset, a well-known and influential figure among diaspora Jews, who publicly <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/avraham-burg-even-i--an-israeli--think-settlement-goods-are-not-kosher-7821011.html\" title=\"\">announced his position in an Independent op-ed</a>. Many young British Jews are exposed to the reality of life in the occupied West Bank through visits and contact with Israeli human rights groups. While a just Palestine-Israel peace has never seemed more distant, the tectonic plates of Jewish diaspora awareness of Israel's self-destructive path are definitely shifting.</p> <p>That dissenting Jews are still demonised is shameful and undermines Jewish&#xa0;pluralism. But it's manageable. Because the Jewish diaspora's support matters so much to Israel's leaders, the quest for serious, open and civil debate among Jews about what is really best for&#xa0;Israel must continue.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>The acquisition of the casino arm of the gambling firm Gala Coral by Malaysian billionaire Quek Leng Chan's Rank Group has been referred to the Competition Commission for scrutiny.</p> <p>With 34 casinos trading under the Grosvenor and GCasino brands, Rank is already the UK's second-largest operator. Only Genting, run by Lim Kok Thay, the scion of another Malaysian billionaire dynasty, is larger. The addition of Gala casinos would add a further 23 sites, giving Rank a commanding 40% share of UK casinos. The group also holds licences for further casinos, as does its controlling shareholder, Quek's conglomerate Guoco.</p> <p>If Rank's takeover of Gala casinos goes ahead, the two Malaysian groups will together control 75% of UK casinos.</p> <p>For many years the ownership of the stock market-listed Rank was fought over by competing Malaysian interests \u2013 Quek's Guoco and Lim's Genting. Genting became Britain's largest casino operator in 2006 when it acquired Stanley Casinos. Guoco tried sought to apply for its own casino licences but after limited success started to acquire shares in Rank. Fearing Quek would take control of Rank, Genting swooped on shares, taking a large stake overnight in what appeared to be an attempt to thwart the takeover ambitions of Guoco.</p> <p>The two Malaysian groups interest on Rank's share register appeared to be in deadlock until last year when Genting seemed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/04/quek-leng-chan-profile\" title=\"\">surrender its interest in Rank to its arch-rival without a fight</a>. Lim's group sold its 11.6% stake \u2013 big enough to block a Guoco takeover \u2013 to Quek's empire in a near nil-premium deal, baffling many analysts and industry experts.</p> <p>That took Guoco's stake to over 40%, triggering a mandatory takeover. Despite advice to the contrary from Rank directors, many smaller shareholders sold out \u2013 again without receiving a takeover premium \u2013 leaving Guoco with a stake of 74.5%.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading said: \"Rank and Gala are two of only three large national casino operators in the UK. This merger would represent a major consolidation, which could be expected to reduce competition, both locally and nationally. The high barriers to entry and expansion in the casino sector mean the loss of competition could potentially be irreversible.\"</p>",

  "<p>It seems oddly appropriate that&#xa0;Tony Scott, who made his living blowing things up and crashing cars, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott-director-dies\" title=\"\">should have taken his life</a> by jumping off a bridge that was a frequent location for movies of a Tony Scott bent, if not for any actual Tony Scott movies.</p> <p>The Vincent Thomas bridge in Los Angeles can be seen in car-chase movies such as The Fast and The Furious and Gone in 60 Seconds, and is misnamed (as the \"Saint Vincent Thomas Bridge\") by Robert De Niro in one scene in Michael Mann's Heat. Whatever it was that led the director to park his car and leap from the bridge to his death in the harbour below, one can't help but recollect the stunning opening sequence of his 1991 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102266/\" title=\"\">The Last Boy&#xa0;Scout</a>, in which a blackmailed pro footballer pulls a gun on the field and shoots anyone attempting to tackle him as he runs for a touchdown, before&#xa0;putting the gun to his head, saying: \"Ain't life a bitch?\" and pulling the trigger.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott\" title=\"\">Scott's incredible journey</a> from North Shields to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092644/\" title=\"\">Beverly Hills Cop II</a> is a shadow-version of the career of his elder brother, Sir Ridley Scott, seven years his senior. And whatever the critics (myself included) may have said, his success at the box office and among his many and varied fans \u2013 first in advertising, then as one of the top directors in Hollywood \u2013 goes some way towards refuting that football player's grim assessment of our sojourn here on earth. That being said, rumours are floating around that Scott&#xa0;had recently been diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, which suggests a reason for this dispiriting act&#xa0;of self-annihilation.</p> <p>Like his brother, Tony Scott made his name in the golden age-cum-gold rush of 1970s British advertising, when&#xa0;future directors included Adrian Lyne, Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker and Ridley were reinvigorating the form by adding&#xa0;sumptuous production design and camerawork to ads for bland and boring products such as Hovis bread (that one was Ridley's). Although, like his brother with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075968/\" title=\"\">The Duellists</a>, he had an arthouse bent that can only be detected in his 1983 debut feature <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085701/\" title=\"\">The Hunger</a> and perhaps in a Henry James adaptation he shot for French television in 1975 (after winning \u2013 or losing? \u2013 a coin-toss with his brother), the failure of The Hunger at the box office left him free to embrace \u2013 reluctantly, at first \u2013 the kind of projects that he later came to be associated with.</p> <p>He was fortunate enough to fall in with the archetypal production team of the coke-dusted, money-swamped, excess-craving 1980s, Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson \u2013 gluttons for style over substance and masters of the hi-concept pitch meeting \u2013 after they saw a Saab car commercial Tony had shot. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/\" title=\"\">Top Gun</a>, the movie they gave him, went on to become one of the biggest hits of the decade, inaugurating the box-office primacy of the young Tom Cruise. It seemed like a brain-dead flagwaver at the time, but Quentin Tarantino gave a famous exegesis (allegedly nicked from his Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary) of the movie's throbbing homoerotic overtones in his&#xa0;cameo in the 1994 independent movie Sleep With Me, an early sign that whatever the critics felt, Tony Scott enjoyed the respect of his fellow&#xa0;directors.</p> <p>Indeed, one of the notable aspects of Scott's work is his enthusiasm for good writers. Tarantino himself wrote True Romance, the movie that Tony held closest to his heart, while The Last Boy Scout \u2013 chock-full of juicily cynical one-liners \u2013 was about the best script Shane Black ever wrote (at&#xa0;the time, he was the highest-paid screenwriter in town). <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099371/\" title=\"\">Days of Thunder</a> may not linger long in the memory, but&#xa0;that doesn't alter the fact that it&#xa0;was written by Chinatown's Robert Towne.</p> <p>Scott essentially invented the modern action movie and his amped-up, noisy, rapidly edited film-making method became the house style of the Simpson-Bruckheimer ascendency. Scott stuck with it even after Simpson's OD death in 1996 broke up the partnership. Thereafter, Scott churned out a movie each year, usually loaded with top-tier stars \u2013 he made four movies with Denzel&#xa0;Washington alone \u2013 and another&#xa0;super-kinetic one-line pitch of&#xa0;a story (\"We can't stop this train!\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/25/unstoppable-review\" title=\"\">Unstoppable</a>; \"they've hijacked a subway train!\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/31/taking-pelham-123-review\" title=\"\">The Taking of Pelham&#xa0;123</a>, and so on).</p> <p>For me, the oddities of Scott's career&#xa0;offer the most fun. I am hard-pressed to think of another movie about Hollywood that is as daffy and off-the-wall as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/oct/14/2\" title=\"\">Domino</a>, and even after&#xa0;seven or eight viewings, I haven't reached the bottom of it, if there is one. I have a sneaking suspicion that in&#xa0;dens and rec rooms across the US, other people are thinking the same thing. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108399/\" title=\"\">True Romance</a> gave the lie to anyone who thought Scott didn't appreciate invigoratingly colourful dialogue, and those arthouse tendencies given full rein in The Hunger do in fact linger like ghosts in the fabric of his mainstream hits.</p> <p>He lived his life like he made his pictures, with all the knobs turned up to 11 and all the needles flicking deep into the red zone: loud, unbelievably over-the-top film-making, enormous wealth and success, an incredible arc to&#xa0;his life from North Shields to the top&#xa0;of the Hollywood heap, and fond remembrances from his peers. The&#xa0;man was beloved. The man will&#xa0;be&#xa0;missed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 August 2012. The original referred to Scott's journey from South Shields, rather than North Shields, to Beverly Hills Cop II and to the top of the Hollywood heap. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The Paralympics will be a celebration not only of sporting prowess, but also of the huge advances made in the emancipation of disabled people in Britain. Although there remains far to go \u2013 and there are major concerns that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare\" title=\"\">coalition's welfare cuts</a> will set back those advances \u2013 that fundamental change is surely irreversible: as a leading expert puts it, the genie is out of the bottle. We are becoming accustomed to seeing disabled people in the community, in the workplace and in the media. Forty years ago, many would have been in residential care.</p> <p>Much of this has come about through the efforts and organisation of disabled people themselves. Led initially by a handful of activists, a nascent disability rights movement seized the initiative in the 1970s and began campaigning for legislative and welfare reforms that now underpin striking societal change.</p> <p>But in 2012, just as the opportunity comes to make a show of Britain's progress before a global audience, the disability movement finds itself at a crossroads \u2013 and, some say, becalmed. The leaders who emerged in the 70s and 80s have gone, or are departing, and the agenda, perhaps understandably, seems dominated by a struggle to preserve gains won.</p> <p>\"In some ways we are much closer to the 70s than to where we were in the 90s,\" said Ian Macrae, the editor of <a href=\"http://www.disabilitynow.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Disability Now magazine</a>. \"As a community we are having to fight a very particular battle [over] what the government is doing ... which is preventing us from making the wider case about why we need more in the way of independent living.</p> <p>\"We have got so completely trapped in the tunnel of argument over welfare reform that disabled people are increasingly happy to present themselves as victims. The leaders of the movement of the 80s and 90s fought [against] that tooth and nail.\"</p> <p>Some of the most influential of those leaders had shaped their views through visits to the first <a href=\"ttp://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/evans/Centres%20for%20Independent%20Living%20as%20an%20Alternative%20to%20Instit%85.pdf\" title=\"\">centres for independent living</a> in the US, where disabled students were provided with personal assistants to enable them to live in the community while at university. Their lifestyle made a profound impression on the visitors, several of whom were living in residential homes where the regimes had scarcely progressed since before the second world war.</p> <p>A letter published in the Guardian in September 1972, proposing a consumer group to represent disabled people living in institutions, is often seen as the start of the UK independent living movement, leading as it did to the creation of the <a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/UPIAS/UPIAS.pdf\" title=\"\">Union of Physically Impaired Against Segregation (Upias)</a> (pdf). The early 1970s were heady days on the political left and the group's founders drew parallels with the struggles for equality of women, black and gay people: Vic Finkelstein, one of its prime movers, was a psychologist with a spinal cord injury who came to the UK from South Africa as a refugee after being banned by the apartheid regime for civil rights activism.</p> <p>A second key organisation was the Disability Alliance, founded in 1974 with the goal of a comprehensive income scheme for disabled people and chaired by Peter Townsend, a leading poverty expert. A paper, titled <a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/UPIAS/fundamental%20principles.pdf\" title=\"\">Fundamental Principles of Disability</a>, summarising discussions in 1975 between the alliance and Upias, is regarded as the first statement of the \"social model\" of disability.</p> <p>The social model, as distinct from a medical model, treats physical or mental impairment separately from disability in the way in which disabled people are excluded from full participation in society. Finkelstein \u2013 who helped develop the idea of the social model with its prime architect, the disability academic Michael Oliver \u2013 used to describe a hypothetical village in which all the residents used wheelchairs and everything was tailored to their needs. When able-bodied visitors arrived, it was they who experienced problems and felt excluded.</p> <p>The social model became the dominant philosophy of the emerging UK disability movement after its adoption by the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People (BCODP), founded in 1981. As disability researcher and commentator Tom Shakespeare has argued, the model's importance was that it gave the movement a strategy \u2013 barrier removal \u2013 and it replaced in the minds of disabled people the idea that they were in some way deficient with the notion that they were in fact oppressed.</p> <p>The effect was liberating. \"They didn't have to be sorry for themselves: rather, they could be angry,\" he wrote in his book Disability Rights and Wrongs. \"Rather than a demeaning reliance on charity, disabled activists could now demand their rights.\" Such demands were given practical form initially by centres for independent living. The first were founded in Hampshire and Derbyshire in 1984, although some universities \u2013 notably Oxford, Essex, Southampton and Cardiff \u2013 had already been developing US-style schemes whereby disabled students shared accommodation with others without disabilities who provided support and assistance.</p> <p>Funding for those starting to live independently came from enlightened local councils, acting at the time with dubious legal authority, and a social security benefit called the domestic care allowance. When the government set out to withdraw the allowance in 1986, triggering outrage, the resulting campaign was the first indication of the gathering strength of the disability movement. Within a year, ministers had announced the <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/ilf/\" title=\"\">independent living fund,</a> a state-funded quango to award discretionary grants worth hundreds of pounds a week to disabled people to live in the community. The bigger prize, however, was a legitimised and universal system of <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/Disabledpeople/DG_10018721\" title=\"\">direct payments by councils</a>. The BCODP began to campaign for this in 1989. The statute took effect in the last days of the Major administration in 1997.</p> <p>That a Tory government passed the measures was highly significant: the idea resonated well with Conservative principles of individualism and self-determination. Under Labour, in a subtle switch of tactics, the disability movement deployed a human rights argument to sustain the case for disabled people having greater choice and control over their lives. Indeed, \"choice and control\" have been watchwords espoused by politicians of all hues since the mid-90s.</p> <p>The focus shifted under Labour to equality of opportunity and equality before the law, following the landmark legislation passed towards the end of the Tory government in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/50/contents\" title=\"\">Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995</a> \u2013 which for the first time required employers and providers of services to help disabled people by making \"reasonable adjustments\" that would remove barriers to their access and participation.</p> <p>For an employer, this might mean varying a job specification to take account of a person's disability or providing adapted equipment, such as desk or chair. For a retailer, it means making \"reasonable\" arrangements for disabled shoppers to be served: not just providing step-free access where possible, but ensuring someone is available, for instance, to assist a blind person who requests help.</p> <p>The DDA was amended and strengthened in 2005, imposing a duty on public bodies to promote equality. It was superseded, except in Northern Ireland, by the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/legal-and-policy/equality-act/\" title=\"\">Equality Act 2010</a>, which consolidated all anti-discrimination legislation in a statutory mirror of the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/\" title=\"\">Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</a>. Since 2007 the commission has combined the advisory and watchdog functions of formerly separate equalities bodies including the Disability Rights Commission.</p> <p>Many lament the passing of the DRC, which Labour had set up in 2000. Bob Niven, who was its chief executive, said: \"Having a joined-up commission has not been as good as disabled people would have hoped; most people would say it has not lived up to expectations. Of course there are similarities [across all groups at risk of discrimination] but I think the experience of being totally blind is not comparable with any other experience; having serious mental health difficulties is different from anything else.\"</p> <p>Niven is nonetheless convinced that the position of disabled people in Britain is markedly improved. \"It's very different than 10 or 15 years ago in terms of access to buildings, trains and public spaces, employment opportunities and application of technology. And it's much, much better in terms of public attitudes.\" Richard Howitt, Labour MEP for the east of England and vice-chair of the disability group in the European parliament, says the UK lags behind some other countries in meeting special educational needs, and that too many disabled people still live segregated lives. But he considers it to be out in front on non-discrimination. \"If you had to go to court and say you had been treated less than fairly, Britain would probably be the place to do it,\" he said. For Frances Hasler, a leading figure in the social care sector who has worked closely with the disability movement, the acid test is public transport. \"Every time I see a wheelchair user waiting at a bus stop in London, that gives me pleasure,\" she said. \"You can't turn that kind of thing back. You can't stick the genie back in the bottle. There is a lot of doom and gloom at the moment, but overall there has been a massive move forward. Although deinstitutionalisation is not yet complete, it's pretty mainstream. The idea that young disabled people don't belong back in institutions is certainly well embedded.\"</p> <p>All agree that there remains much to do. Disabled people continue to suffer persistent disadvantage in almost all aspects of life: <a href=\"http://www.poverty.org.uk/40/index.shtml\" title=\"\">one in three live in poverty</a>; <a href=\"http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/docs/res/factsheets/b1-disability-employment-factsheet-employment-rates.pdf\" title=\"\">one in two of working age are unemployed</a>; and older teenagers are <a href=\"http://testsandexams.qcda.gov.uk/libraryAssets/media/Briefing_sheet_one_introducing_the_DDA_act.pdf\" title=\"\">twice as likely as their non-disabled counterparts not to be in education, employment or training</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/aug/14/disability-hate-crime-increase-reported-incidents-data\" title=\"\">Hate crime has become a serious issue</a>, with recorded incidents growing by 60% between 2009 and 2011.</p> <p>Yet just as the disability movement needs fresh impetus, there is a seeming crisis of leadership and direction. Many of the movement's leaders have gone or are, by their own admission, burnt out. Where will the new generation come from?</p> <p>Some argue that, as talented young disabled people can now enjoy rewarding careers, they have little time for campaigning: <a href=\"http://www.radar.org.uk/publications/doing-seniority-differently/\" title=\"\">research by the charity Radar in 2009</a>, though far from exhaustive, traced 110 disabled \"high flyers\" earning \u00a380,000-plus salaries.</p> <p>Another suggestion is that a sense of complacency may have set in after the remarkable gains of the 1990s. Macrae said: \"After the DDA, a lot of people, including some of the activists, said: 'That's it, we have got what we want now.' They stopped protesting, stopped saying, 'This is not enough.' A lot of the spirit and a lot of the anger went out of the movement.\"</p> <p>Anger is certainly evident now, in reaction to the coalition's disability benefit changes, and much of it is being expressed by new grassroots networks of disabled people linked by social media. But there is a frustration among veterans of past struggles that they have been drawn into an agenda not of their choosing and are having to fight a rearguard action to try to preserve entitlements. Some are seeking to regain the initiative.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/rethinking-disability-policy\" title=\"\">recent paper for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a>, Jenny Morris, who was a disability policy adviser to the Labour government, has argued that disabled people need to instigate and lead a wider debate about the nature and purpose of the welfare state, applying to it the concept of reasonable adjustments that lies at the heart of the DDA, and thereby challenging the creeping prejudice that benefit payments are merely a drain on the economy.</p> <p>Liz Sayce, chief executive of the charity Disability Rights UK, which now incorporates Radar and the Disability Alliance, believes there are significant issues \u2013 potential \"quick wins\" \u2013 that could be taken up even at a time of austerity. These include campaigning for the <a href=\"http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/odi-projects/fulfilling-potential.php\" title=\"\">government's forthcoming disability strategy</a> to have real teeth, and exposing the failure of Whitehall departments to work together on disability issues; ensuring ministers fulfil their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/14/mental-health-bars-mp-removed\" title=\"\">promise to overturn the ban on jury service for people with a mental disorder</a> and to scrap the legal provisions that can have them stripped of company directorships, and pressing for tougher action against negative portrayals of disabled people in the media.</p> <p>Sayce is more sanguine than others about the emergence of new, young leaders of the disability movement. Some 450 people have been through leadership programmes initiated by Radar and the charity established a network of high flyers, <a href=\"http://www.radiate-net.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Radiate</a>, with the support of Lloyds bank. Her Radar predecessor Kate Nash has gone on to help establish <a href=\"http://www.katenashassociates.com/home\" title=\"\">networks of disabled employees</a> in more than 220 companies and public bodies including Lloyds, BT and the houses of parliament.</p> <p>\"Many of these people won't become leaders in the classic, activist sense,\" said Sayce. \"But we shouldn't forget those who are leading opinion in different ways, across all sorts of sectors. Twenty or 30 years ago, there simply wouldn't have been disabled people in these positions.\"</p> <p>The disability movement faces a further, more fundamental question about its future direction, however. Shakespeare has come to the conclusion that for all the strengths of the social model of disability as a campaign umbrella, by adopting it uncritically in the 1980s and adhering rigidly to an unchanging interpretation of it since, the movement has taken a wrong turn. The importance of people's individual and shared impairments has been played down; the potential of medical intervention and advance has been dismissed; and the disability community has turned inward and failed to make alliances with other groups in society, he said.</p> <p>Shakespeare threw down his challenge in his book in 2006, calling for a reappraisal of strategy to galvanise disabled people once again. \"Since 2000, the disability movement in Britain appears to have stagnated,\" he wrote. \"Despite important and progressive changes in wider society, the politics of disability seem to have run out of steam.\" Six years on, his challenge remains.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Bovis Homes on Monday joined a growing list of housebuilders to report a strong rise in profits over the last six months from a surprise rise in prices and sales.</p> <p>Bovis said prices were 6% higher and sales up 18% on the same period in 2011 despite the weakening economic outlook and lack of mortgage lending.</p> <p>The company, which has shifted most of its building to the south of England, said it had enough land with consents to last three to four years in normal trading and much longer if the trend for low levels of transactions persists for another year.</p> <p>Chief executive David Ritchie said the firm had 30,600 plots that could be used for house building, \"but I'll only build as many as I can sell\".</p> <p>The company's profitability has also been boosted by a strategy to buy up development plots whose value had been depressed in the financial crisis, along with an increase in the number of its sales outlets and its focus on building in regions where house prices have stayed strong.</p> <p>Ritchie said it was financially safer to build below a line drawn from Cheltenham in the west to Cambridge in the east after a severe slowdown in the northern half of the country.</p> <p>Like most building firms, Bovis has scaled back the number of homes it builds each year and restored margins by reducing staffing levels and other outgoings.</p> <p>In the first half of 2007, at the height of the boom, the company built 1,250 homes compared with 944 completions in the last six months.</p> <p>Bovis builds mainly three to five bedroom family homes on greenfield sites north and west of London where the demand for new homes has remained robust.</p> <p>Rivals Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt Developments also reported strong profit growth this year after a torrid four years during which many housebuilders have gone out of business and others, hugely indebted after a pre-crisis spending spree, were only saved by the forgiveness of their banks.</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey reported an increase in first half profit up 50%, helped by strong demand for its properties, and said it expected full-year 2012 returns to be in line with its expectations.</p> <p>Britain's second largest builder by market value, Taylor Wimpey saw operating profit jump to \u00a3100.9m against \u00a367.2m in the same period last year.</p> <p>Bovis, which also builds social housing for housing associations, celebrated a 27% increase in revenues to \u00a3170m compared to \u00a3133m in the same period last year. Last year it built only 844 homes in the first six months.</p> <p>Brokers have put buy notices on much of the industry, believing in the potential for growth after a sharp reduction in debts and the potential for further increases in sales should the economy recover. Some analysts believe house prices could fall further outside central London.</p> <p>Ritchie said initiatives to support extra lending in the economy by the Bank of England had failed to reach its customers, who were still considered high risks by lenders, but more specific government initiatives were having a positive effect.</p> <p>He praised the NewBuy scheme that acts as an insurance bond to protect lenders against the default of a new mortgage. So far only a trickle of customers have successfully come through the scheme, though he expects momentum to grow over the next couple of years.</p> <p>He poured cold water on plans to jettison requirements for social housing in major developments, saying the lack of financial underpinning from housing associations may undermine the projects.</p> <p>\"If that was to come to fruition as a policy, one of the concerns would be, how are the banks going to support an increased level of private development?\" Richie said. \"In the short term it could potentially be difficult ... to see volumes growing.\"</p> <p>Bovis and its rivals are required under UK law to set aside a proportion of their schemes to be sold as affordable, cheaper homes. But recent reports have suggested a review by Sir Adrian Montague, the chairman of venture capital group 3i will suggest this stipulation is relaxed.</p>",
  "<p>I broke my leg a while back. I wasn't too clever on crutches so I used a wheelchair. I went into a restaurant with my family and was shocked that the waitress looked over me and only addressed my husband and daughter. Perhaps before I had that experience I might have acted like the waitress \u2013 I might have, in my embarrassment of not knowing how to behave, ignored me altogether. Over the next few weeks it will, of course, be impossible to ignore the athletes participating in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2012\" title=\"\">Paralympics</a>, but will that affect public attitudes to disability more generally? Why can able-bodied people be so awkward with others who happen to be differently able?</p> <p>In an experiment in which able-bodied people were asked to sit next to a&#xa0;disabled person, half were first allowed to stare at the disabled person through a two-way mirror and half were not. All were then measured how closely they sat next to the disabled person. They found that those who were allowed to stare sat closer than those who were introduced without first having had that opportunity.</p> <p>This suggests that wanting to avoid disabled people comes from a lack of previous exposure to them \u2013 there seems to be, if not a fear of the unknown or of difference, at least an anxiety about it. There is a conflict of what the able-bodied think they ought to feel about disabled people and the actual emotions experienced. For example, we want to follow our curiosity and stare and we also want to adhere to the social norm of not staring.</p> <p>Disabled people experience hate, guilt, patronising attitudes, avoidance and persecution. Why? Have we become so addicted to speed and convenience that we begrudge disabled people the best parking spaces? Although we can measure behaviour, such as in the experiment described above, finding out why that behaviour occurs is harder, as we tend to give the answers from the point of view of the person we would like to be rather than face up to who we actually are.</p> <p>Working as a psychotherapist with parents, I have found it is often a child's whining or crying that triggers rage in a parent because it is easier to fall back on anger than to awaken memories of one's own childhood vulnerability, or to acknowledge the shame of feeling impotent in a situation we feel incapable&#xa0;of making better. So if we perceive or&#xa0;imagine vulnerability in another person, it may be more comfortable for us to persecute or patronise than to empathise or accept.</p> <p>Humans are innately wary of those who are different, and to feel that anxiety is vulnerable-making. Rather than acknowledge our own anxiety, most of us would rather ignore or deny our response, or go even further and marginalise, blame and persecute those we feel to be the source of our ill feeling. Maybe we'll try to justify it by saying disabled people cost us money, or slow us down. A tale was told to my husband about an acquaintance who recently found himself travelling first class with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/hawking\" title=\"\">Stephen Hawking</a>, and how the thrill of celebrity proximity was soon superseded by finding himself annoyed by the occasional bleep from medical equipment.</p> <p>We now have legislation that coerces planners to consider the needs of disabled people. Some of the mockery towards political correctness may be fuelled by guilt that we needed campaigns to bring about legislation to begin to work towards equality. It is easier to mock than to experience our shame.</p> <p>Yet an unquestioning embrace of political correctness can mean we go too far and bracket all the differently able people together. A special needs teacher who works with children with profound and multiple learning disabilities told me they have such severe learning and physical difficulties that they will never be able to say \"mummy\" or show they recognise who mummy is. Yet, she must prepare lesson plans and teach subjects such as geography, French and maths because it is the children's right, according to the Declaration of the Rights of Children, to have those lessons, even though it doesn't appear possible that they could gain from them. We can be so keen not to discriminate that we can be in denial of difference.</p> <p>The world of disability is a shifting landscape. There are people who until relatively recently would not have survived, but we are now working out how to be with them. I think we will find that one size does not fit all. I hope the more access and opportunity granted to disabled people, the more familiar they will become to those who are able bodied \u2013 and that we'll learn to look past disability and see the multifarious people we have been unused to acknowledging.</p>",
  "<p>Barnes &amp; Noble is to take on Amazon in the European digital book market by launching its Nook e-reader in the UK this autumn.</p> <p>The move marks Barnes &amp; Noble's first expansion outside the United States, and follows a $605m (\u00a3385m) cash injection by Microsoft in April as the software company acted to capitalise on the digital publishing boom.</p> <p>A nook.co.uk shop front will open in mid-October, selling e-readers and a catalogue of digital books, magazines, newspapers, films and computer games. The company says it will soon announce partnerships with \"leading UK retailers\" to sell both devices and content from its range of 2.5m digital titles.</p> <p>The Nook, launched in October 2009, has been popular in the US and helped Barnes &amp; Noble eat into Amazon's ebook market share.

The Chilean master was hard at work on a new feature, The Lines of Wellington, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/19/raul-ruiz-obituary\" title=\"\">at the time of his death last August</a>, aged 70. This was a Napoleonic-era epic, a \"Portuguese War and Peace\", set in 1810 as the French troops battled with&#xa0;a British and Portuguese army commanded by General Wellington. At&#xa0;Wellington's bidding, a daunting system of fortifications \u2013 the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_of_Torres_Vedras\" title=\"\">Lines of Torres Vedras</a> \u2013 was secretly built to repel the French invaders. Wellington pursued a scorched earth policy, which displaced huge numbers of Portuguese and British; it's their story the film tells.</p> <p>The cast for Lines of Wellington, led&#xa0;by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/john-malkovich\" title=\"\">John Malkovich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/isabelle-huppert\" title=\"\">Isabelle Huppert</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/16/catherine-deneuve-interview\" title=\"\">Catherine Deneuve</a>, was assembling when Ruiz died. Rather than abandon the project, the producer Paulo Branco decided to continue, and began shooting two months later. Ruiz's editor and widow <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0765384/\" title=\"\">Valeria Sarmiento</a> took over directorial duties; Branco told the press this was \"a Raul Ruiz film ... directed by Valeria Sarmiento\". The film will now premiere at Venice early next month.</p> <p>Is it a Ruiz film, or a Sarmiento film, or both? Sarmiento scoffs at the idea she was a medium through which her late husband was able to complete his final film. \"Obviously, there was a lot of&#xa0;communication between us. [But] this is a film by me. I made the decisions,\" she says, speaking on the phone from Chile. Yes, several of Ruiz's ideas have remained and, yes, they were married for a very long time (more than 40 years), \"but that doesn't mean we can communicate after death\". Nor is the film the last we will hear from Ruiz. His final novel, The Wit of the Staircase, in which he \"narrates his life not as himself but as a ghost\", according to his publisher, is out in English later this year.</p> <p>Ruiz films came in every shape and&#xa0;size. There were more than 100, and he was an extraordinarily idiosyncratic director. There were literary adaptations (his Proust film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGpcZJ8obEI\" title=\"\">Time Regained</a>, with Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and Vincent Perez), vampire flicks (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1231273/\" title=\"\">Nucingen House</a>), video films, low-budget experimental ones, TV series, artist biopics (Klimt, for instance), comedies and commercial thrillers (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320236/\" title=\"\">A Closed Book</a>, starring Tom Conti and Darryl Hannah).</p> <p>I interviewed him in 2009, and he told me: \"I don't complain and pictures come. It's like the way my father used to talk about women: if you paid too much attention, they went away. If you didn't pay attention, they went away. Money is like that and films are like that.\" He was philosophical in circumstances that would have driven other directors to distraction. When the British producers of Klimt (2006) brought in an outside editor to shorten it, he was appalled but refused to become embittered. He simply went and made another film.</p> <p>There are elements in Ruiz's biography that seem bewildering. Late in his life, he took a <a href=\"http://abdn.ac.uk/modernthought/people/raul-ruiz.php\" title=\"\">part-time teaching job at Aberdeen University</a>, becoming an incongruous presence on the north-east coast of Scotland. He liked to start by warning his students: \"You have to forget about pain, gain and fame. If you can forget about that, you may be able to make films happily.\" He quoted Martin Luther and Oliver Cromwell at them, and told them that \"the great Satan, Hollywood, is doing things that are against the nature of cinema. Cinema is not only an entertainment. It is a sacred activity, too.\" But Scottish students had little idea who he was.</p> <p>Ruiz found Scotland provincial, and that was what he liked about it. \"Old age is provincial, somebody said, so it was good for me,\" he told me in 2009. \"This is a puritan province of the world, so you have to deal with that. But they have this good sense of humour, which helps a lot, a sense of nonsense and a poetical sense of life.\"</p> <p>French actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0693799/\" title=\"\">Melvil Poupaud</a>, who first worked with Ruiz as a child and appears in The Lines of Wellington, saw him in hospital the day before he died. Despite his failing health and recent liver transplant, the director was discussing his plans for the film and cracking jokes. On Ruiz shoots, Poupaud remembers, there would always be at least one sequence in which everybody swapped jobs. The makeup artist would push the dolly, the sound technician would take a role in front of camera, the actor would hold the boom and so on. This, Poupaud says, was all part of his attempt to make film-making fun, \"something of a childish world still going on\".</p> <p>Poupaud likens him to a mysterious figure from a fantastical piece of fiction. \"In some old books, you have an uncle who appears and disappears, almost like a pirate in Treasure Island. Everything around Raul was 'Ruizian'. A dinner with him would be like magic because he would order food you hadn't heard of. Friends would appear, scientists and philosophers.\" It's typically perverse that, at the time of his death, Ruiz wasn't working on a small chamber piece but a full-blown epic. He had also recently completed The Mysteries of Lisbon (2010), a four-hour, 19th-century costume drama that sold all over the&#xa0;world.</p> <p>Ruiz's official \"final\" film, <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/article/raul-ruizs-night-across-the-street-to-be-released-posthumously-by-cinema-guild\" title=\"\">Night Across the Street</a>, screened in the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes in May. Even so, the actors' call sheets on The Lines of Wellington shoot described the project as \"a Raul Ruiz Production\". Sarmiento says she aimed to keep a&#xa0;familiar atmosphere on set. (It helped&#xa0;that she was working with cinematographer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1803905/\" title=\"\">Andr\u00e9 Szankowski</a>, who shot The Mysteries of Lisbon.) \"Everybody was ready to work in a different way. I don't know precisely what it was but there was something sacred: everybody knew this was a film by Raul as well. It was a very, very peaceful shoot.\" Even actors such as Malkovich, Deneuve and Huppert, all of whom had worked with Ruiz before, were reportedly on their best behaviour. \"All these actors loved Raul,\" Sarmiento says. \"They knew this was the film he wanted to make. It was a gesture of great loyalty and affection.\"</p> <p>When he died last year, the then French president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\" title=\"\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> paid&#xa0;tribute to Ruiz, calling him \"an unmatched storyteller\". (The director had settled in Paris in 1973, following Pinochet's military coup.) But Ruiz never became a household name, in spite of his vast output. Outside France, relatively few of his films received mainstream distribution. The&#xa0;irony, which he surely would have appreciated, is that a film made after his death might now bring him a wider audience than any film he made in his&#xa0;lifetime.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 August 2012.

  "<p>Maybe it's time for compulsory biology lessons for politicians, but this week Todd Akin, a US Republican senate candidate, claimed that rape didn't cause pregnancy. While attempting to explain his proposals for a no-exceptions policy on banning abortion Akin said there did not need to be an exception for rape, because \"it was really rare\" for rape to lead to pregnancy. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,\" he explained.</p> <p>He didn't elaborate on what such a mechanism might be. But perhaps he had been talking to the similarly non-licensed or educated doctor-politician, <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1988-03-23/news/26277205_1_freind-woman-secretes-luigi-mastroianni\" title=\"\">Stephen Freind</a>, who said in 1988 that rape victims \"secrete a certain secretion\" that kills sperm. Apparently, in conservative imagination, the interior of the vagina is much like a fleshy soda machine with a series of sacks filled with different kinds of liquids that dispense when the proper button is pushed. Press the \"rape\" button, and out comes the spermicide. Press the \"she was asking for it\" button and a welcome mat-style secretion comes out. Presumably pressing the \"Jesus\" button causes a secretion that enters a woman's bloodstream and teaches modesty and submission to her husband's will. The vagina really is a cave of wonders!</p> <p>In all honesty, that Akin, who is a marching member of the Christian right, believes this should be no surprise. Anti-abortion Christians are well trained in the art of substituting wishful thinking for facts, and then aggressively promoting their made-up nonsense as if it were historical or biological truth. It starts with their rock solid belief that Jesus Christ wanted banning abortion to be a priority, despite never once even mentioning the issue. It shouldn't be surprising that those who make stuff up about their Lord and Savior would easily leap straight to spinning nonsense about the female reproductive system.</p> <p>The belief that rape is effective contraception is just one of many wild beliefs. For years, activists have widely circulated two demonstrably untrue ideas about abortion: that it causes depression and breast cancer. Anti-abortion politicians frequently try to write these false claims into law \u2013 requiring doctors to \"warn\" patients about the nonexistent risks of breast cancer and depression. Just this summer, South Dakota has been defending a law requiring doctors to tell women that if they get abortion, their risk of suicide goes up. In reality, there is no causal relationship between abortion and <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2011/01/28/having-an-abortion-doesnt-lead-to-depression/\" title=\"\">depression</a>.</p> <p>In fact anti-choicers have so little regard for science that they're trying to rewrite the very definition of \"abortion\". It currently means \"terminating a pregnancy\". They want to expand that definition to include female-controlled means of preventing pregnancy \u2013 declaring that IUDs, birth control pills and emergency contraception are now \"abortion\". The claim is that these methods work by killing fertilised eggs because of the thinned uterine lining but in reality, hormonal contraception works by suppressing ovulation. Since between one third and one half of fertilised eggs die on their own, women on the pill lose far fewer fertilised eggs due to ovulation suppression than women using no method at all. Unlike the pill, emergency contraception <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/health/research/morning-after-pills-dont-block-implantation-science-suggests.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">has no effect on uterine</a> lining at all.</p> <p>There's still some mystery to how IUDs work, but the prevailing theory is that they kill sperm. None of this matters to the anti-choice movement. They want to believe that women controlling their own fertility is the equivalent of murder, and will distort the facts any way they can to rationalise that view. Indeed, prior to Akin's rape comments, he was on record claiming that emergency contraception, which works by suppressing ovulation, is abortion. Presumably the same made-up doctors who told him that rape is contraception were the ones telling him that actual contraception is abortion.</p> <p>The only question left is whether or not Akin's witch doctor act will hurt his chances in the polls. With a chorus of right-leaning pundits calling for him to give the nomination to another Republican, we may finally have reached a tipping point in how much conflating of science and magic the US public will accept.</p>",
  "<p>The family of a Muslim man left in an apparently vegetative state after a heart attack five weeks ago caused severe brain damage have begun an appeal to ensure he will be given life-saving treatment, against the advice of clinicians, if his condition worsens.</p> <p>A judge at a court of protection in London heard that patient L, a 55-year-old man from Greater Manchester who cannot be named, was being treated by Pennine acute hospitals NHS trust. The trust is seeking a court declaration that it would not be in patient L's best interests to offer him ventilation or resuscitation if there was a life-threatening event or any other deterioration.</p> <p>The patient's family, who have a strong religious faith, argue that it is too early to make the decision and are asking for more time to see whether his condition improves. They claim that within days of his cardiac arrest a \"do not resuscitate\" notice appeared in his notes without their knowledge, and in contravention of the trust's own policy. When his family learned of the notice, they objected and it was removed.</p> <p>In a written statement to the court, L's wife of more than 40 years said they had several adult children and were \"a very close family\". Her husband was a happy, loving person \"and a loving and caring father\".</p> <p>L, who has had two previous heart attacks, suffered a third cardiac arrest in mid-July, which led to his current condition and treatment in a high-dependency unit (HDU). The NHS trust says treatment should be limited to what doctors consider reasonable to maintain his dignity and to relieve any pain and discomfort he may be feeling, but should not extend to resuscitation or ventilation.</p> <p>His life expectancy could be many months or longer. L's family want the judge to rule that \"all steps\" should be taken to preserve his life. One of his sons, referred to as FL, said Muslims in general \"believe that you prolong life as far as you can go and that you actively take every step to so do\".</p> <p>He added: \"My father was very aware of these issues and often when we heard stories in the media about negligence and decisions to turn off life-support, he would wince his face and give a look of disapproval. It was a solemn look of disapproval and sadness.\"</p> <p>L had ensured his own father's life was prolonged when he was seriously ill, FL said. The family do not believe L is as unresponsive as the doctors suggest and say they have observed \"some degree of responsiveness\".</p> <p>The case has come before the court as L, whose interests are being represented by the official solicitor, is a vulnerable adult whose condition means he lacks the capacity to make decisions about his medical treatment. His family believe that if L could express his wishes he would not agree, because of his faith, to an order that he should not be resuscitated or ventilated.</p> <p>Claire Watson, appearing for the trust, said it was the unanimous view of clinicians treating L, as well as independent experts, that he was in a persistent vegetative state \"with minimal prospects of improving any neurological function and no meaningful prospect of further recovery\".</p> <p>She said: \"Rather than there being the prolongation of life, there would be the prolongation of death and lack of dignity.\"</p> <p>The trust said L suffered a hypoxic brain injury as the cardiac arrest was so severe. The clinicians said he was in a vegetative state resulting from severe brain damage, a diagnosis that was confirmed by a consultant neurologist on 25 July.</p> <p>L was taken off the ventilator and was breathing independently two days later, after he had a tracheostomy. On 3 August he was moved to the HDU and is now in a stable condition. He has a very poor prognosis, according to the clinical team.</p> <p>An intensive care consultant said he had not been able to elicit \"any purposeful response\" from L, and said he would not \"significantly improve\". Another consultant, who specialises in anaesthetics and critical care, estimated there was \"less than 1% chance of meaningful recovery\".</p> <p>Any recovery would be very limited and leave L \"profoundly physically and mentally impaired\". Although L's eyes opened spontaneously they do not focus or follow movement. He is tube-fed, has a catheter and does not move or respond to verbal command or physical stimulus. Watson said L was unable to interact with his surroundings and would always be dependent on others. He was prone to respiratory deterioration, skin and urinary infections and the risk of pneumonia.</p> <p>An independent expert in intensive care, jointly instructed, said it was \"absolutely unrealistic\" to expect any further neurological recovery from such a \"minimally conscious state\". The expert supported the trust's position. An expert in neurology, also jointly instructed, accepted that prognosis was notoriously difficult in PVS cases but supported the trust's position. The law requires a doctor to provide treatment and care in the best interests of a patient such as L, who is incapable of making decisions for himself.</p> <p>The trust accepted that, in assessing best interests, the court was not limited to considering \"best medical interests\" and had to take account of the beliefs and values likely to influence L if he could make his own decision. The court also had to consider the views of family members.</p> <p>Watson argued that the patient view's and his family's were highly material but were \"not the governing factors\",.</p> <p>A ruling is expected in the case on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Across Afghanistan, foreign soldiers are carrying loaded weapons to gyms, mess halls and offices to protect themselves from people they thought were their allies. A series of attacks by Afghan policemen and soldiers on their Nato mentors and comrades-in-arms have undermined military morale and the basis of the international mission in Afghanistan.</p> <p>In the latest incident, on Sunday, two policemen in the Kandahar border town of Spin Boldak turned their guns on US soldiers, killing one. This year about 10% of the foreign soldiers killed in Afghanistan have died at the hands of Afghan government forces, and there have been more such attacks and deaths than in all of 2011.</p> <p>\"We're in Afghanistan allegedly to help the Afghan people, and then our soldiers are being killed by Afghan soldiers that we're there to help. That just doesn't make sense to people,\" said Andrew Exum, a senior fellow with the Centre for a New American Security, who led a platoon of US army rangers in Afghanistan in 2004. \"For that reason, I think that even though these attacks may be somewhat insignificant tactically, they have a huge strategic effect on the coalition.\"</p> <p>The political impact was on display when the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Holland, announced in May that he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/francois-hollande-troop-pullout-afghanistan?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">bringing the country's troops home early</a>, a move driven in part by an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/25/afghan-soldier-french-marines-desecration\" title=\"\">assault by an Afghan policemen</a> in January.</p> <p>\"The French have made their decision and it was partly based on the awful green-on-blue attack they suffered,\" said one senior diplomat in Kabul, using a military term for such attacks. He warned that the shootings had the potential to dent Washington's commitment to Afghanistan. \"It certainly is a political problem in the US. It might affect the speed of the US drawdown in 2013 and 2014, because if the public reacts strongly in a negative way to this, that is a political factor that they will have to take into account.\"</p> <p>The Taliban have claimed almost all of the attacks, and the Afghan army and police are trying to weed out infiltrators with undercover intelligence agencies and background checks on new recruits. The military coalition in Afghanistan has long argued that most shooters are not groomed insurgents but driven by pent-up anger and personal issues in bases where weapons and ammunition are almost always to hand. \"There are some attacks that we will never understand. Of those we do, the vast majority are attributed to personal grudges,\" said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the Nato-led mission.</p> <p>A military report on the problem from April last year, titled <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gwu.edu%2F~nsarchiv%2FNSAEBB%2FNSAEBB370%2Fdocs%2FDocument%252011.pdf&amp;ei=bmEyUNfuEKPC0QWa54DgDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHn5zgZimPF7dN_PSAbkyJTTSkTlA\" title=\"\">A Crisis of Trust and Cultural Incompatibility (pdf)</a>, cited anger over everything from civilian casualties to apparently minor issues such as US soldiers urinating in public. American troops in turn looked down on Afghan counterparts for reasons ranging from perceived bad hygiene and laziness to drug use and corruption.</p> <p>But analysts and diplomats say there is little comfort to be taken from the failure to find a Taliban hand in most attacks. Random outbursts driven by resentment and anger are a far greater concern because they are so much harder to tackle. \"If it's infiltration, it is a strategic, tactical decision which you can take measures to counter,\" said the senior diplomat. \"They are bringing in better intelligence, better vetting, undercover agents. But you can only marginally reduce the toll this way if it's not infiltration, because if you have those impulses going on now, you will have them in the future.\"</p> <p>The attacks threaten to undermine the west's long-term plans to keep Afghanistan out of Taliban hands. As foreign troops head home, those left behind are switching their efforts from fighting insurgents to training up Afghan security forces to go into battle instead.</p> <p>Exum said: \"The strategy going forward relies on the assumption that US and allied forces are going to be able to have a close working relationship with their Afghan counterparts. And I think now we are having to re-evaluate the way in which a decade plus of war has strained not just the Nato alliance but has severely tested the goodwill of the Afghan people and our working relationship with the Afghan security forces.\"</p> <p>Nato officials have stepped up security with a \"guardian angel\" system of soldiers whose only job is to watch their fellow troops. Others must keep their weapons loaded at all times. The system may have reduced the number of deaths \u2013 some shootings since the guardian angels were introduced have ended only in injuries \u2013 but it will do nothing to resolve the underlying problem.</p> <p>\"Its systemic and it will continue until we leave,\" said the Kabul diplomat. \"But I think it will be very difficult for the population to understand and the politicians to explain.\"</p>",
  "<p>Until they find a genuine franchise vehicle for the Rock (aka <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRock\" title=\"\">Dwayne Johnson</a>), Hollywood lacks a bona fide, standalone action star. Those old warriors Sly, Bruce and Arnie are back in action in the weekend's number one movie <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"\">The Expendables 2</a> but, truth be told, the real pyrotechnics in this enjoyable romp come from a comprehensive supporting cast of macho types and their rainbow of fighting styles.

This box-office behaviour plus the lack of A-lister looks and/or outsize ego mean he has never quite percolated into the public consciousness a la Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p> <p>And that's too bad, because Willis remains the only one of the testosterone triumvirate from the 80s and 90s who still seems believable in the right role: Sly and Arnie are clearly too long in the tooth. Heck, even they don't take themselves seriously any more, as attendees at the Expendables 2 panel witnessed at Comic-Con last month. You can't have action stars laughing about their aches and pains after a day's shooting; you wouldn't have heard such a thing from Rambo or the Terminator.</p> <p>So the all-star package enabled The Expendables 2 to open top at the box office on a modest $28.8m (\u00a318.3m), several million below the debut of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131950/expendables\" title=\"\">The Expendables</a> exactly two years ago.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good morning. Well, morning. It's time to assume the position. On 20 August 2001, Mark Butcher played the innings of his life, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPEpkMTArww\">an astonishing 173 not out</a> as England breezed to a target of 315 to beat the mighty Australia, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63939.html\">scoring their runs in just 73.2 overs</a>. On 20 August 2012, they will need a similarly mind-blowing innings if they are to beat South Africa and stay at the top of the world rankings. No, no my breath is not currently held.</p> <p>England, chasing 346, will resume on 16 for two after a traumatic mini-session last night in which both openers were trapped LBW by Vernon Philander. On the equivalent Monday a year ago, England were presented with the ICC mace. Since then England have won three out of 10 Tests. That happy August day, when plenty of people matter-of-factly opined that England would dominate world cricket for the next 5-10 years, seems a long time ago.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>\"<strong>Morning Smyth, morning everybody</strong>,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Is it revisionism of the worst kind to opine that this England side never was the best in the world, and only made it to the top of the ICC rankings because of the number of points they got for beating the India side that had declined substantially from the one that had itself got to the top of the rankings? I say this not in the spirit of I told you so (not least because I didn't, and was one of those who got rather carried away at the Oval last summer) but to suggest that there might not be all that much to worry about, in the sense that this isn't a fall from greatness, simply a reminder that the England side is not quite as good as \u2013 but able to compete with \u2013 a genuinely good South African side.\"</p> <p>The long answer is yes. When South Africa got 398 for one on the first day at Edgbaston in 2003, Duncan Fletcher said something like \"Good players are allowed to score hundreds against you.\" By the same token, bloody good teams are allowed to outplay you in a series. England have a few issues to resolve but to suggest they were never that good in the first place is tedious nonsense.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>In case you missed it yesterday</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/video/inline/0,26691,12607_8003627,00.html\">this is great</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>\"Ouch</strong>,\" replies Josh Robinson. \"Not 'never that good'. Competitive with the best sides in the world. Up there in the top two or three. Just not the best in the world, and certainly not by some margin.\" Right now, no, South Africa are clearly better. But was that the case a year ago? I'm not so sure. Don't forget that, before this summer, South Africa had won only three of their last nine series. They even mlost a Test at home to a Murali-less Sri Lanka, which is an embarrassment. They have been much better in this series \u2013 only a fool would argue otherwise \u2013 but I think the 2010-11 England would have been their equal.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Something to talk about today</strong> Let's discuss the issue on the lips of every single person in the country: overground train seat etiquette. Why do people who secure seats make it clear with such aggression that they don't want anyone else in the same postal district? And why do so many people stand for their 47-minute journey rather than utter the words, \"Can I sit there please?\"</p> <p>The most amusing approach came from a semi-drunken friend who, upon seeing a bad that was taking up two seats, said brusquely to its owner, \"You're gonna have to move that.\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 16-2 (target: 346; Trott 6, Bell 4)</strong> It's overcast at Lord's, with the lights on. In short, a lovely morning for bowling. If England lose a couple early on this could be over in a hurry. There are few things in cricket as demoralising as batting to save a game you needed to win. You often see a collapse in such circumstances \u2013 think <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63788.html\">Antigua 1998</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/226351.html\">Lahore 2005</a>. Morkel starts with a fine maiden to Bell, including one sharp delivery that is fiddled on the bounce to slip.</p> <p>\"If you want to keep the seat next to you open,\" begins Martin Crosoer, \"make eye contact with the individual approaching it, smile, and stroke the seat\u2026\" Rubbing your thigh with the other hand is optional.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 23-2 (target: 346; Trott 8, Bell 4)</strong> <br>Vernon Philander, who bowled a devastating spell last night, beats Trott with a stunning delivery that lifts and seams away sharply. A peach of an awayswinger also beats Trott \u2013 and AB de Villiers, which means a bye for England. The next ball also beats de Villiers, this time scooting away for four byes.</p> <p>\"How should the England management rebuild?\" says Dave Ferguson. \"From numbers 1 to 11 who's world class and who do we need to replace? Keep Cook, Bell, Prior, Anderson and Broad and ditch the rest? Or is it more a question of tactics than players?\" A lot depends on what Strauss does. If he continues, I'd keep the same pool of players for India. I don't think anyone deserves to be dumped, although they will have an eye on the form of a few players. It's time to make Finn a regular though. The tour party for India might be something like: Strauss, Cook, Trott, Taylor, Bairstow, Bopara, Bell, Prior, Davies, Swann, Panesar, Tredwell, Broad, Anderson, Finn, Bresnan, Onions.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 24-2 (target: 346; Trott 9, Bell 4)</strong> Trott is beaten by consecutive deliveries from Morkel, the first short and the second full. South Africa are all over England at the moment.</p> <p>In other news, Iain Chambers has thumped the tub so hard that it gave him a rhyme in return:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"They call me a dope<br>But got faith like the pope<br>Ball after ball<br>Will go over the rope<br>Catches go down<br>Slippery like soap<br>Keep on believing<br>Coz there's always... Oh sod it! All over by 3 o'clock\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 29-2 (target: 346; Trott 14, Bell 4)</strong> Trott won't last long here. He is struggling badly and has just edged Philander over the leaping third slip for four. There is yet another play and miss later in the over, a wild cover drive at an awayswinger.</p> <p>\"Much as I wish it was South Africa who were 23-2 this morning and chasing a stratospherically high target, I believe it is in fact unfortunately England who are that position,\" says Daviid Roberts. \"I'd suggest you altered the score headline of each over to reflect that grim reality.\" You do realise you're reading the Guardian don't you?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 34-2 (target: 346; Trott 18, Bell 4)</strong> Trott plays and misses for the 97th time this morning, although in his defence this was a storming lifter from Morkel. The next ball is flashed behind point for four. Trott is playing extremely aggressively this morning. Quite right too. There's no point England hanging around for a draw here.</p> <p>\"The other thing to bear in mind with these rankings is that they are calculated over a period of several (three?) years,\" says Mike Jakeman. \"So it's quite feasible that the world number one might be a side that has been excellent for a few years but is fading once they reach the top. Like India 2011. Of course, this would become a much easier argument if the ICC introduced the World Test Championship. Which they should.\" I'm all for a Test Championship, but even then you'd have people saying that the best team doesn't always win a cup competition, which is an argument that has some merit. It's far better to just use your eyes I suppose. England were the best team in the world a year ago. South Africa are the best team in the world now.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 34-3 (Bell c Smith b Philander 4)</strong> My colleague Barry Glendenning is cackling maniacally and that can only mean one thing: Ian Bell has gone. He threw the bat at a wide, shortish outswinger from Philander that flew off the edge to Graeme Smith at first slip. A fairly straightforward chance slipped out of his grasp, but he was able to clutch it at the second attempt. Philander has wonderful figures of three for 11.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 36-3 (target: 346; Trott 18, Taylor 2)</strong> \"I never block my seat with a bag: it's the height of rudeness,\" says Simon Bell. \"It's not even necessary. The two-litre bottle of super-strength cider in front of me seems to keep most people away.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 39-3 (target: 346; Trott 21, Taylor 2)</strong> Trott times Morkel nicely through midwicket for three. That brings James Taylor on strike. Whether he lasts 10 balls or 200, this will be one of the more important tutorials of his Test career.</p> <p>\"Few things annoy me more than seat nazism,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"We've all sat down with a bag on a seat in a quiet carriage, but most of us are more than happy to move around should it be needed, but some people's willingness to act deaf/mute to hold their territory is teeth-gnashingly infuriating. There's an astounding lack of shoe-on-the-other-foot understanding here as well. If it was the other way round, they'd be covering you in spittle in high-visibility seat rage, but it's fine for them to stare at their paper while you shuffle past, no doubt tutting as you do so. The same goes for people that sit on the outside seat and don't move in, people that stand by a door and block entrance to a carriage, and god forbid, want to get on like their life depended on it, even when you're still trying to get out. Dammit Smyth, I was in a GOOD mood until you opened this pandora's box. Now I need a walk round the block.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2)</strong> <br>\"I am very much a glass-half-empty type of person but one just has to accept the Boks are a phenomenal side,\" says David Brown. \"Their bowling attack has a wonderful balance to it and their batsmen's Test averages show what a serious run-making unit they are. The only surprising thing is that they have not dominated the Test arena for the last few years as their only newish addition is Philander.\" Yes, they do seem to save their best for England. It's staggering to think a team this good <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/514033.html\">could be thrashed at home by Sri Lanka</a>, and it's weird that they've won only three of their last nine Test series. Their pace attack, as you say, is one of the most beautifully balanced we've ever seen. Any nominations for a more balanced high-class pace attack?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2)</strong> Here comes Dale Steyn to bowl to his bunny Jonathan Trott. A Sky graphic tells us that, in this series, Trott is 39 for three against Steyn, and I don't think he was much better in the 2009-10. Trott is beaten, yet again, and shouts \"fuckin hell\" to no one in particular. The next ball brings a biggish shout for a catch down the leg side, but Simon Taufel isn't interested. It was straight off the thigh pad.</p> <p>\"I hate train seat hogs so much that I purposely ask to sit next to them even when there are double seats free around them,\" says <strike> Walter Mitty </strike> Richard Marsden. \"Then I sit there hating them for their selfishness and myself for waging such a self-defeating crusade. But based on the principle that it's better to pursue unhappiness for others than happiness for yourself, on balance I'd say it's worth it.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2)</strong> <br>Even though we don't really get to see his work, we shouldn't underestimate the role of Gary Kirsten in all this. Look what's happened to India since he left. Everything points to him being a seriously good coach. South Africa's tactics against a number of England players \u2013 Strauss, Cook, Trott, Bell, Prior, Swann \u2013 have been brilliant. Crucially, they've had the players to implement those plans. Philander temps Taylor into a loose drive that flies off the edge but short of third slip. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2)</strong> I think England came out intent on forcing the issue, but South Africa's excellence means they have little option but to defend. It's another maiden from Steyn to Trott. Steyn has figures of 7-4-4-0.</p> <p>\"Should we be too surprised at England being knocked off the top of Test<br>cricket's tree?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Perhaps the West Indies and then Australia producing two or three great sides back-to-back has seduced us into believing that dynasties are the norm. They're not. Even though Test cricket has a very limited number of nations playing, the differences in conditions around the world, the sheer hard work of bowling fast (the best way to win Test matches) and the years it takes for a batsman to establish himself fully (think Steve Waugh or Ian Bell), means that few sides dominate for years. I saw a graph once that proved this, but I can't find it online.\" Yep, this is spot on. And it could well change hands again by the end of the year, depending on India v England and Australia v South Africa. If Australia win that series \u2013 which will be a stormer \u2013 they will go top.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 41-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 3)</strong> Kallis comes on for Morkel. His first ball is a ridiculous jaffa to Taylor that angles in and then boings away down the slope. That almost seamed square. Don Bradman might just have got an edge on it; Taylor didn't.</p> <p>\"There was a brief window of opportunity during which Pakistan could have fielded Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif, Mohammed Amir and Umar Gul together (I don't know if they ever did),\" says Ranil Dissanayake. \"Had they, it would have been, respectively: fastest bowler in the world, best seam bowler in the world, best left-armer in the world and the best reverse-swinger in the world. That has to be worth a shout. Of course, there is a school of thought that the most balanced bowling attack ever was Malcolm Marshall. Swing, pace, seam, aggression and accuracy.\" Ha, how true.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 45-4 (Taylor run out 4)</strong> Farce, welcome home, English cricket has missed you. Come here Farce, give us a big hug. It's been too long. Trott pinged Steyn towards cow corner and ran three. Taylor wanted a fourth and set off but Trott, who originally started to run, then changed his mind and that meant both batsmen ended up at the bowler's end. The throw came in to Steyn, who got it down the other end for AB de Villiers to break the stumps as Taylor desperately tried and failed to complete his unexpected shuttle run. That was utterly ridiculous.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 45-4 (target: 346; Trott 22, Bairstow 0)</strong> Well that's the end of England's chase. Plenty thought we'd hear another that begins with 'Ch' this summer. The only thing South Africa have choked is the England top order.</p> <p>\"I sat on someone's bag once because their ignorance to the rest of the crammed carriage infuriated me,\" says Edward Knapp. \"They could see the rest of us were like sardines but chose to leave the bag on the seat, so I sat on it. I swiftly got off at the next stop because the tryant of abuse I received from the bag's owner. Apparently he was upset because the bag contained his son's 9th birthday cake. This is a tip to anyone who is taking home their children's birthday cake \u2013 don't leave it in a bag, on a seat in the middle of rush hour, especially when there is a hot, irritable fat man is desperate need of a seat standing next to you.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYamMpAAR7k&amp;feature=relmfu#t=25m47s\">27th over: England 45-4 (target: 346; Trott 22, Bairstow 0)</a></strong> \"TMS is putting the blame for the run out on Trott,\" says Amy Clements. \"What's your verdict Smyth?\" I blame KP.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 52-4 (target: 346; Trott 29, Bairstow 3)</strong> Bairstow, trying to drive that deadly straight outswinger from Steyn, gets a thick edge through point for three, and then Trott slaps four to third man. The camera cuts to Graham Gooch on the balcony. He's inadvertently doing a Bruce Forsyth pose, his fist pressed against his forehead. No, he's not smiling and shouting 'Nice to see you, to see you nice'.</p> <p>\"If memory serves me right,\" says Alex Bishop, \"this isn't the first time Trott's been involved in a run out?\" Indeed. It's a bit like saying 'If memory serves me right, this isn't the first time Joey Barton has made a plonker of himself on Twitter'.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 61-4 (target: 346; Trott 37, Bairstow 4)</strong> Kallis overpitches a fraction and is square-driven handsomely for four by Trott. And now he's been dropped! Trott sliced a drive to the right of Rudolph at third slip, who couldn't hang on to a diving chance. He should have held that. You've just dropped the ICC mace, pal!</p> <p>\"Balanced pace attack,\" says Dan Smith. \"Lee/McGrath/Warne/Gillespie. End of story.\" Warne was a demon quickie, Spofforthesque at times.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 69-4 (target: 346; Trott 37, Bairstow 12)</strong> Bairstow is beaten on the inside by Steyn \u2013 no idea how that missed the stumps \u2013&#xa0;and then drives through the crouching Morkel at extra cover for four. He gets another boundary with a crisp clip off the pads. England have scored 24 from the last three overs. South Africa are really on the rack now.</p> <p>\"Best example of bad seat etiquette was on a train from Schiphol to Amsterdam central station,\" says Matthew Valentine. \"Carriage was virtually empty apart from one woman and a group of 4 of us. My bag was too big to fit on overhead storage so I put it on a seat. The woman asked me to take my bag off the seat and when I turned to her she had both her bags on seat next to her. I said I would if she'd do the same, to which she replied that hers were ok as they were clean and did not have wheels. I told her my bag was also clean and that once she removed her bags from the seat I would do the same. She didn't, so neither did I.\" And you're still together, right?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 71-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 12)</strong> Trott, trying to drive Kallis, edges <em>this</em> far short of the diving Amla at backward point. \"Ok, so it was a very brief moment, but surely Harmison, Hoggard, Flintoff and Jones?\" says Alex Burrage. \"Pace, swing, aggression and reverse swing.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 79-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 20)</strong> Another edge from Bairstow off Steyn drops short of the slips and then scuttles away for four. He gets his fourth boundary later in the over and it's easily the best of them, a delightful push down the ground. Bairstow has 20 from 15 balls.</p> <p>\"I think we all know that most balanced pace attack all wore the maroon cap,\" says Paddy Blewer. \"For my money: Marshall, Ambrose, Bishop, Walsh \u2013 bearing in mind I wasn't around to really see Holding etc, and Sylvers Clarke was banned. Sure, the Saffers are very good, as was England a year ago, but to compare either to the horsemen of the apocalypse is silly. Fun but silly.\" Oh crikey, we were only talking about balance. This South Africa attack is brilliant but nobody would compare them to the attack you mentioned above, or Holding, Croft, Roberts and Garner.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 79-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 20)</strong> A maiden from Kallis. \"When I was 7, my dad thought it'd be a good idea to tell me what he would do in the event of a nuclear war (some might call this unorthodox parenting, but not me, I was only 7): he told me he'd sit in the garden and have a glass of wine,\" says Olly Lambert. \"For some reason I'm reminded of this advice as I glance at the score. Corkscrews at the ready, everyone outside...\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 87-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 28)</strong> Morkel replaces Steyn, who was smashed out of the attack by Trott and Bairstow and is palpably past his best. Morkel has a big shout for LBW when Bairstow whips around a full delivery angled in towards him. Simon Taufel says not out but South Africa decide to <strong>review the decision</strong>. I suspect this will be 'umpire's call' and therefore not out. Yep, it was just clipping the outside of the leg stump, so the original decision stands. Bairstow pulls brilliantly through midwicket for four to move to 28 from 20 balls. I suppose I just probably type '<em>#silverlining</em>' at this point, eh? Eh?</p> <p>\"I was once on a train where the conductor announced that any bags on seats in a carriage where others were standing would be charged the full adult single fare,\" says Martin Kane. \"This drew wonderful sheepish expressions from those who then had to move their bags (generally attempting to do so without anyone noticing). Never mind your Olympic medallists \u2013 this man was a true hero. Incidentally, Southern users might also be familiar with the middle seat conundrum (where the configuration is rows of three). Those who sit on the outside of such rows (leaving the middle seat free) are often even more militant and protective than 'baggers'.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 98-4 (target: 346; Trott 40, Bairstow 37)</strong> Tahir comes on for Kallis. His third ball is tossed up invitingly. Bairstow accepts the invitation and swipes it gloriously down the ground for a one-bounce four. He sweeps very fine for four more later in the over to bring up the fifty partnership in great time. This is a cracking little cameo; Bairstow has 37 from just 24 balls. I think I may be falling in love with you, Jonny Bairstow.</p> <p>\"Most balanced pace attack,\" says Nick Hughes. \"Igglesden, McCague, Headley, Fleming, Ealham. Case closed.\" I think I may be falling in love with you, Nick Hughes.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 104-4 (target: 346; Trott 46, Bairstow 38)</strong> Trott steers Morkel through the slips for four to bring up the hundred. The crowd are cheering every boundary heartily. There have been a few in the last half an hour; in the last nine overs England have scored 59 runs. No, not it's not going to happen, but we can still enjoy watching a thoroughly likeable young man give full expression to his considerable talent. Mind you, if England somehow find themselves 200 for four at 3pm...</p> <p>\"Our school bus driver in the 80s used to come up to the top deck and bellow 'If yer want a seat for yer bag, yer can pay fer it',\" says Dan Smith. \"TfL should have that as their official policy.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 109-4 (target: 346; Trott 48, Bairstow 41)</strong> Tahir goes around the wicket and into the rough. Bairstow continues to attack, charging a full toss and whipping it for a single. He has 41 from 29 balls and could be on for one of the faster Test fifties. The fastest, of course, are belong to Ian Botham, from 28 and 32 balls.</p> <p>\"New Zealand circa mid/late 90s \u2013 McMillan, Harris, Larsen, Astle \u2013 dibble, dobble, liquorice and all-sorts,\" says Grant Harrison. In the 1992 World Cup there was Harris, Larsen and Latham, who were known as Dibbly, Dobbly and Wobbly. (Latham was definitely wobbly.) The three tortoises of the apocalypse.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 111-4 (target: 346; Trott 49, Bairstow 42)</strong> A big nipbacker from Morkel hits Trott on the pad and lands just short of de Villiers. Morkel thought there was an edge but replays suggested otherwise. As Shaun Pollock says on Sky, the lunch break will be good for South Africa. Bairstow's approach has caught them on the hop.</p> <p>Never mind balanced pace attacks, Noor Jivraj reminds us of the ultimate balanced spin attack: Prasanna, Venkat, Chandra and Bedi.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 114-4 (target: 346; Trott 52, Bairstow 42)</strong> Trott pushes Tahir for two to reach a much needed half century. He was all over the place early on but has played pretty well since running out James Taylor. Tahir skips a quicker one past Bairstow's inside edge and onto the pad&#xa0;\u2013 it pitched outside leg \u2013 before beating him with a beautiful legspinner.</p> <p>\"Ah, Chris Harris,\" says SB Tang. \"Only New Zealand could give the world a bald, slow-medium international bowler. He was reasonably effective too, especially in ODIs, with an economy rate of 4.28 and an average of 37.50.\" He was exasperatingly effective. That's an outstanding economy rate, even in the 1990s.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 120-4 (target: 346; Trott 57, Bairstow 43)</strong> Trott edges Morkel along the ground for four. Are any of our South Africa readers getting worried yet? I really wouldn't; there's no way this can happen. But just for the record, as we go to lunch, England need a further 226 from 63 overs. If they do somehow pull it off, let's all meet in a field and drink celebratory drink until the sun comes up on Thursday morning. It'll be the inaugural Bairstow Festival. So far Trott and the fearless Bairstow have added 75 in 14 overs. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session. I'll leave you with this from Dan Lucas. \"<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090852/quotes\">These two haven't seen Clockwise, have they</a>?\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>The English view</strong> \"Of course, we won't do it, but\u2026 if the positions were reversed, and South Africa were chasing, at what point would you get that ice-cube-down-the-spine feeling?\" says Steve Hudson. \"Pretty soon?\"</p> <p>If they get to 200 for four. Only then would I start lifting grannies' handbags on the off chance they contain beta-blockers.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>The South African view</strong> \"Yes, Rob, some South Africans who are reading the cricket ARE getting worried,\" says Simon Pamphilon. \"Well, at least one of us is.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>The alternative English view, from a lunatic</strong> \"226 in 2 sessions with 6 wickets remaining?\" says Si Begley. \"This is ON!!!!! Anyone got the number for the Swedish women's handball team to see what shade of red they want to paint this town tonight?\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 123-4 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 58, Bairstow 45)</strong> This is very surprising: Graeme Smith has decided to open the bowling after lunch with <strike> Dame Judi Dench </strike> Imran Tahir. He's bowling into the rough from over the wicket, and England take three-low risk singles.</p> <p>\"Re train seats \u2013 the opposite effect can be had by getting on a<br>long-ish distance train journey with a fresh take-away pizza,\" says Amy Clements. \"I did this last week from Newcastle - London and was immediately mobbed by a load of (well, three) pissed Northern blokes. They didn't get the<br>pizza off me though, oh no. I did however have to endure one of said<br>pissed blokes dribbling in the seat next to me whilst I scoffed it.\" And you're still together, right?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 132-4 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 59, Bairstow 52)</strong> Philander has a big shout for LBW when Bairstow whips around the front pad. Runs were given by Simon Taufel, but there didn't seem to be an inside edge. Doesn't matter as it was going down and bouncing over. A flick to fine leg for four brings Bairstow to an intrepid, heartwarming half-century from only 41 deliveries. </p> <p>\"Hell, I like Si Begley,\" says Matt Dony. \"He seems like a good man to have on hand in a crisis. Not that he'd necessarily actually do anything, but you can't put a price on that kind of positivity. It's palpably not 'on' yet, but he almost convinced me. Almost.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 134-5 (Bairstow b Tahir 54)</strong> That Hives song. I told you it couldn't happen. And I told you bowling Tahir was the wrong move. A-hem. He has skidded one right through Jonny Bairstow and into the stumps, a superb piece of bowling that prompts some champion in the Guardian to instinctively exclaim \"Effing hell\". Sorry.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 134-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 60, Prior 0)</strong> Actually, seeing that dismissal again, it kept a bit low and almost went under the bat. Bairstow was back when he should have been forward and ultimately that did for him. But it was still good bowling, flat, quick and skipping into the off stump.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 134-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 60, Prior 0)</strong> A maiden from Philander to Trott. \"Am I missing something here?\" says Tom Atkins. \"Someone puts their bag on a seat when the train's not busy because either a) it's heavy and difficult to put in the overhead storage or b) they might want to get something out of it later. Train gets busy. Someone else goes up to said person and says 'Can I sit there please'. Person puts bag somewhere else. How socially inept are all these people that they can't politely ask someone to move their bag?\" You clearly haven't had The Look.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 134-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 60, Prior 0)</strong> Tahir has caused Prior a few problems in this series, and gets one to spit viciously out of the rough onto the body. Tahir thought it hit glove and was screaming for someone to catch the darn thing, but they didn't and it didn't.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 136-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 1)</strong> Trott flicks Philander off middle stump for a single. Philander was a quarter of the way through his appeal when the bat came down at the last possible minute. That would have been plumb.</p> <p>\"Did Tom Atkins (44th over) just ask how socially inept OBO readers are?\" asks David Hopkins. \"He's new around here isn't he?\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 138-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 3)</strong> Prior drives Tahir down the ground for two. It was in the air for a while, and Tahir is making life pretty difficult out of the rough. There are no risk-free attacking shots. \"Things have changed. in the late 60s: my sister, a pretty teenager,\" remembers GRAEME POLLOCK giving up his seat for her on the bus,\" says Kallie Hanekom. \"Thus was soon after his magnificent Test hundred before lunch at Trent Bridge.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 138-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 3)</strong> Trott flicks around the pad at Philander, prompting a huge LBW shout. Simon Taufel says not out and Philander immediately signals for the review \u2013 but only the captain can do that. Smith comically turns his back on Philnander and, after a long discussion with Kallis and de Villiers, decides not to review. Vern doesn't like that, Vern's got a face on him, but Smith was right: Hawkeye shows it was bouncing over the stumps. That was very funny. Philander was<em> desperate</em> to review it, and Smith only just stopped short of the full David Brent 'Not interested!'</p> <p>\"On the subject of train seats, people need to stop bothering with any semblance of politeness,\" says Neil Taylor. \"Dependent on my mood, I either say 'Hup hup' to get people to move their bags or just sit on said bag. Someone did get a bit sniffy with me when I did that when the train was full of Great Britain supporters after one of the rowing events. I apologised saying that I didn't see it as I couldn't imagine anybody would be selfish enough to have their bag on the seat when the train was so busy. Fluster from him, smirks all round from everybody else. Be brutal people, together we can stamp this out.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 138-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 3)</strong> \"I'm going to make myself a mixtape of your OBO chortling to listen to when ahm glum,\" says Georgina Turner to my left. Most of us are cocooned under headphones for MBMs/OBOs and are so thus make a few noises that you don't usually hear in a busy office. I reckon if I heard a tape of the exclamations I make during an OBO I'd be too embarrassed to ever leave the house again.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 142-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 62, Prior 6)</strong> The sun is out at Lord's now. I was just about to type that conditions might be better for batting when Philander seamed an awesome delivery past Prior's outside edge. He's got a very good case for the Man of the Match award here, as brilliant as Amla's century was. South Africa's seamers are bowling very straight to Prior, as in the first innings.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>51st over: England 146-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 63, Prior 9)</strong> You can win a Test from this position \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63855.html\">Australia's win over Pakistan at Hobart in 1999 is the precedent</a> \u2013 but realistically only two results are possible now, not least because scoring out of the rough is so difficult. Prior drives pleasantly through the covers for a couple.</p> <p>\"I got onto a train to London to find my carriage full of stag-do inebriates, one of whom occupied my reserved seat,\" says Iain Chambers. \"After tense negotiations, I secured my seat and set about my chosen lunch, a manly portion of sushi. After they'd alighted at Doncaster, the Scottish fellow opposite me explained they'd been calling him 'The Professor' since Newcastle. \"I think it's because I was reading a book\". He was quite phlegmatic about their uncouth behaviour. Me? I think they were a bunch of cu... ooh, how's Matty Prior doing?\" You got lucky. In Trainspotting, somebody found his reserved seat taken by Francis Begbie, and unwisely endeavoured to rectify the situation.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 146-6 (Trott c Kallis b Steyn 63)</strong> What a catch from Jacques Kallis! Dale Steyn has struck with the first ball of a new spell \u2013 and it's his bunny Trott once again. It was a nasty delivery that got big on Trott, who could only edge an attempted cut stroke. The ball raced off the edge towards second slip and Kallis \u2013 with a reaction time of approximately 0.0000000002 seconds \u2013 moved high to his left like a goalkeeper to take a sensational two-handed catch. That really is breathtaking. Steyn has dismissed Trott six times in Test cricket now; he gleefully shows four fingers and two thumbs to his teammates and says \"that's six times\".</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>52nd over: England 153-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 9, Broad 7)</strong> Broad is going to go down swinging; he already has sevn from five balls. \"And there is the difference,\" says Brad McMillan. \"We would have put that catch down in this series.\" England have dropped nine catches in this series. Three of them (Amla in the first Test, Petersen in the second and Amla here) cost almost 550 runs.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>53rd over: England 158-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 10, Broad 11)</strong> Facing Tahir out of the rough will be even harder for the left-handed Broad. One of John Buchanan's ambidextrous cricketers would definitely play right-handed here. The first ball Broad faces is inside edge <em>just</em> wide of the diving Amla at short leg.</p> <p>\"Ah, Hobart 1999,\" says SB Tang. \"I was still in high school in Melbourne. Our teachers stopped class to let us watch the match. I seem to recall that even proceedings in federal parliament were hurried along to enable MPs to watch the impending miracle.

He top edges a pull for four off Steyn, who responds with a clever slower ball that beats Broad's attempt to launch it so far that it lands in someone's pint in The Good Mixer in Camden. Broad middles one later in the over, pulling a mighty six over square leg. Twelve from the over!</p> <p>\"My Dad once sat on two chaps on their way back from That London because they were blocking the middle seat of a three-seat group with their widely spread knees (to make room for their massive \"bags\", obviously) and they didn't move fast enough when he said 'excuse me',\" says Louise Wright. \"Fortunately he looks a bit like the kind of wizened chap that might have secret ninja skills, so he escaped unscathed.\"</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>55th over: England 174-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 14, Broad 23)</strong> Prior premeditates the reverse sweep and gets Tahir away to third man for four. Tahir responds with one of the worst LBW appeals in history; the ball pitched 14 miles outside leg stump. Although, as Mike Atherton says on Sky, we've seen then given in the days before DRS, most notably with that hilarious Alec Stewart dismissal in Galle in 2000-01. I wish I could find that on YouTube. The Gaffer's face was priceless.</p> <p>\"If you don't want someone to sit next to you on a long cramped National Express coach journey, just sit there with a slightly mad look on your face while people are boarding,\" says Tom Ireland. \"Works every time.\" Or just read the Guardian.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>56th over: England 176-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 15, Broad 23)</strong> Two from Steyn's over. It's not often the case that Matt Prior is the straight man, but that's been the case in this short partnership. He has 15 from 39 balls, Broad 24 from 18.</p> <p>\"England appear not to be going down fighting exactly, but going down entertaining, which in the circumstances I think is absolutely the right call,\" says Sarah Bacon. It's the Australian way.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>57th over: England 179-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 18, Broad 24)</strong> The crowd have anointed Imran Tahir as pantomime villain after he deliberately pulled out of his delivery stride in the previous over, and there are zesty, liquor-fuelled cheers when Prior drives him for three. Then Broad <em>smashes</em> a pull onto the helmet of the ducking Amla at short leg. Thank goodness for helmets, eh. Mind you, in 1995 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvKE3Uh6Eng#t=38m48s\">a helmetless Nick Knight was smashed on the head at silly point</a>.</p> <p>\"I don't like people sitting next to me on the train, so if I have a bag I put it on the seat next to me <strong>especially</strong> if the train is crowded, then pretend I don't notice people scouting around for seats, only moving the bag if I think I might be physically assaulted,\" says Steve Hudson. \"I know this is unpleasant and wrong, but whatever.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>58th over: England 183-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 22, Broad 24)</strong> Prior opens the face to steer Steyn wide of the slips for four. When he fails to put away a cover drive later in the over, Prior exclaims, \"Oh, <em>Matthew</em>.</p> <p>Here's Sara Torvalds. \"A friend of mine at uni used to be so annoyed with people unable to say 'Excuse me' (and trust me, Finns are even worse at it than your average Brit \u2013 I can even prove it to you linguistically: we are so averse to the smallest bit of polite conversation that Finnish has no word for 'Please') that whenever she got the aisle seat on a train or bus, she'd close her eyes as soon as she realised the person in the window seat wanted to get off, just to force them to open their mouth instead of silently indicating that this was their stop.\" In its own way, that's almost as heroic as <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3736999/Mystery-superhero-leads-fight-on-louts-he-accuses-of-MURDER-of-the-English-language.html\">the work of Grammar Man</a>.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>59th over: England 184-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 22, Broad 25)</strong> The crowd are slow-clapping Tahir every time he comes into bowl. An optimistic LBW shout is turned down, with Broad outside the line of off stump. England, for the record, need 162 from 44 overs. If only they were chasing 280 rather than 346.</p> <p>\"Not sure how sympathetic the OBO would be to this, but on a stag do up to Newcastle, we had reserved seats scattered through a carriage, with 3 of 4 round a table,\" says Tim Gibbs. \"On getting on the train, the 4th seat was taken by a woman on her own. Being early in proceedings and thinking we were doing the gentlemanly thing we offered to swap that seat with one of our friends who was way down the carriage but the woman steadfastly refused to move, and so had to endure 3 hours of \"witty\" conversation and drinking games before getting off in a huff. I don't think she finished her sudoku puzzle that evening. Were we in the wrong? And no, unfortunately we are no longer together.\" So <em>you</em> were the ones Amy Clements was going on about in the 41st over.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>60th over: England 187-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 23, Broad 27)</strong> Morkel comes back to replace Steyn. Six balls, three singles. There has been a bit of niggle between Broad, Steyn and Morkel, possibly over Morkel's follow through. Simon Taufel has a quiet word with Broad and Prior.</p> <p>\"Before this series, I thought Big Vern Philander was a Hoggy-lite - swung it<br>from the hand without much nip and had got lucky as batsmen relaxed a little on being away from all-time great Steyn and headhunter Morkel,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Part of me still thinks that, but another part marvels at his discipline and consistency, always making the batsman play (or, at the very least, making him decide late to leave it). And his batting, that I expected to be a bit of long-handled slogging from 9, has been perfectly judged for the match situation from 8. Gary Kirsten certainly knows a player and certainly knows how to get the most from a player.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>61st over: England 190-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 23, Broad 30)</strong> Broad is beaten by a wonderful googly from Tahir. \"Did you know,\" begins my sort of colleague John Crace, \"that opposite your OBO, the Guardian is offering readers the chance to book England Test cricket tickets for Thursday 1 January 1970.\" Oh my goodness, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/20/england-south-africa-live\">so we are</a>.

England's target i- ah, forget it.</p> <p>\"Just like elite sport, the seat-on-a-train-occupied-by-a-bag conundrum is played out 90% in the minds of the antagonists,\" says Peter McLeod. \" On a good day, I can stride up to to the offending seat, lean over a wee bit (but not enough to be, like, intimidating) toward the bag's owner and brusquely but politely enquire 'mind if I sit here?' This invariably leads to hasty rectification of the situation and a pleasant, comfortable journey. But there are also those days where I'm not quite in the interacting-with-other-people 'zone' and the train carriage morphs into a deadly field of traps, snares and unencouragingly positioned eyebrows. Those are the journeys spent wondering at the length of time it takes to go even one measly stop and trying to work out where you went wrong in life.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>65th over: England 199-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 26, Broad 36)</strong> There are around 20 minutes to tea. Tahir continues to keep Prior quiet by dumping it in the rough. Prior has 26 from 73 balls; very slow by his standards. I suppose his plan to just stick in the game for as long as possible, and then <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVL4210_FsY\">go all Astle on South Africa's ass</a> if England have even an outside chance.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>66th over: England 204-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 30, Broad 37)</strong> Kallis, on for Morkel, beats Prior with consecutive deliveries. Prior's riposte is a splendid back-foot drive for three to bring up the 200. Do not dare think it, never mind email it.</p> <p>\"Hasn't this Test been great?\" says Piers Barclay. \"Almost every day, it's managed to offer us that tiny hint that Hope's approaching the door \u2013 54-4 (their one, obviously), Finn's little burst yesterday, Bairstow today \u2013 and then brilliantly struck her down, until the next time you imagine there might be half a chance we can win. And today, it keeps tempting me to leave the office and head to Lord's, but we all know that the second I get on the Jubilee line, we'll lose the last four wickets simultaneously, so I won't. Selfless, I know.\" </p> <p>It's been a wonderful Test match. Arguably not quite a great Test \u2013 it needed England to get a bit closer to the target for that \u2013 but still one of the better Tests involving England since 2005.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>67th over: England 2045-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 31, Broad 37)</strong> Prior continues to kick Tahir away and work the odd single. He's scored 15 from 55 balls against him in this innings, as compared to 16 off 28 against the quicks.</p> <p>\"COME ON ENGLAND!! We can still do this,\" says Richard Parker, who is also a lunatic. \"On another matter, is Sara Torvalds the most unlikely OBO botherer/England supporter ever? Being that she is from Finland and a lady?\" Possibly, although we've yet to ascertain what species Mac Millings is so it could be him.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 208-7 (Broad c Amla b Kallis 37)</strong> It's over, you don't need to tell me... Broad has top edged a hook to fine leg, with Amla waiting an age and then calmly taking the catch despite plenty of woooooooooooooooooohs from the crowd. The third umpire wants to check if it was a no-ball on height, but that looks absolutely fine. <strong>He's out</strong>! It was a superb bouncer from Kallis, heavy and straight.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>68th over: England 208-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 34, Swann 0)</strong> Just the 280 Test wickets for Jacques Kallis then. That's all.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>69th over: England 215-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 34, Swann 7)</strong> A preposterous shot from Swann, who defends his first ball from Tahir and reverse-slog-sweeps his second for four! Even the coaching manual shed tears at that one.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>70th over: England 221-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 35, Swann 11)</strong> Swann does well to steer a lifter from Kallis wide of the slips for four, and then Prior is beaten on the inside by a cracker that jags back and just bounces over the off stump. That's the end of an entertaining afternoon session. For those of you who are clinically insane and think England have a chance, they need 125 from 33 overs in the evening session. Tom Bryant will talk you through that; you can email him at <a href=\"mailto:tom.bryant.casual@theguardian.com\">tom.bryant.casual@theguardian.com</a>. Congratulations to South Africa, an outstanding and very likeable team, and thanks for your emails throughout the series. Bye!</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>Afternoon everyone:</strong> The new ball is due in 10 overs, or 40 minutes or so. That, more than anything, is perhaps why South Africa haven't shown any nerves at all this afternoon. Philander, Morkel and Steyn have proven time and time again in both this match and the series quite how brilliant they are with the red cherry. In that light, it does seem hard to view anything Swann and Prior might do here as anything other than a heroic, but ultimately doomed last stand. Still, there's always the 0.000001% of an Englishman who just wonders ...</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>Re the Finland debate:</strong> Here's Sara Torvalds to clear up any questions: \"As to my being the least likely OBOer (67th over), I might well be, but I blame Mike Selvey. A holiday in Goa during an India v Pakistan Test series got me curious about this alien game nobody I knew played or even understood, and his (and Athers's) cricket writing got me hooked. So there.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chris Wareham has this to add: \"I'd just like to point out that Finland makes up for its lack of politeness by having more words for drunkenness than any other language.\"</p> <p>Each one of those words will be used by any England fan currently in the stands at Lord's if this doesn't end in tears. Or if it does, for that matter.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>Anyone else</strong> got a horrible feeling the difference between the sides will be Philander's 61?</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>71st over: England 221-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 35, Swann 11)</strong> Tahir resumes and Prior attempts a big old hoicked sweep from out of the rough but misses. He settles down for a couple of balls, then has another go with the same results. He knows he's got to score from out of the rough, so walks back to leg for the final ball of the over to combat Tahir's line, but only clip to the fielder at square leg. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>72nd over: England 231-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 36, Swann 21)</strong> Kallis cramps Swann for room with his first two, then drops one short. Swann swivels and clonks him lustily to the boundary. He then does the same to the next ball, walking across his stumps to do so. A couple of singles follow.</p> <p>\"Has anyone else experienced plane storage bin rage?\" asks Seamus Devlin. \"I was going to a bachelor party in Montreal from LaGuardia and I was sitting in front of a guy who had put his bag right in the middle of the small-ish storage bin. To get my bag in, I moved his a bit to the side. He stood up and said 'What are you doing?' in his best offended French-Canadian and moved his bag back to where it was. A friend I was traveling with, a large New Yorker, yelled at the top of his voice (the entire cabin looked round) 'SIT DOWN FRANCE!' I can only assume that, like De Gaulle, this guy thought that he was in fact the nation as he did sit down.\" A lot of these stories seem to involve stag dos, don't they?</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>73rd over: England 236-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 40, Swann 21)</strong> Prior is trying to play Tahir by backing away and making room. The spinner has, thus, been following him. But he drops one short here and Prior slaps him to the midwicket boundary. His response is to turn a beauty from outside leg right across the stumps. They run a tight bye before Tahir again forgets the rule that, pitching the ball outside leg, somewhat negates the chance of an LBW. His yelp after hitting Swann in front is quite rightly ignored.</p> <p>Meanwhile Rob Smyth has just offered Sean Ingle odds of 100-1 for England to win from here. Ingle, never one to turn down a bet, has promptly slapped two quid down. IT IS ON!</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>74th over: England 240-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 43, Swann 22)</strong> Kallis has stopped dropping the ball short, bowling a proper line and length and stopping the batsmen scoring. He's keeping time before the new ball. Prior isn't having it though, and so runs a very good, very tight too - taking on Dale Steyn's arm, which is a bold thing to do.</p> <p>\"I once met some drunken finnish football fans at a Sunderland game who taught me the Finnish for 'Cheers' which is 'Kippis' but is pronounced Git Pissed which is statement of intent in Scotland,\" emails Ged Lerpiniere. Good old Finns. Good old Scots.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>75th over: England 255-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 51, Swann 29)</strong> Tahir is aiming for those pitch marks again and Swann knows as much. He comes skipping down the wicket and thumps him for a big six into the Compton lower. A quick single takes the runs needed below 100. Prior gets in on the act too, reverse sweeping the spinner to the cover fence for his 50. He does the same two balls later. Smyth's beginning to sweat about that \u00a3200.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>76th over: England 265-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 51, Swann 39)</strong> Kallis is still bowling that tight line, no width, no short stuff, no half volleys. Or at least he was ... Swann steps back to a shortish one and simply slams it over the rope for another big six to bring up the 50 partnership. He steps into a sweet cover drive next for four.</p> <p>\"The photo on your OBO page of Kallis leaping salmon-like to catch Trott shows the exact spot where I was sitting on Saturday,\" emails Rob Wright. \"Back then it was a sun-bathed paradise full of happy smiling England fans. Now it looks like bleaker than a Specials album cover.\" I was sitting directly above you in the upper tier. Sun bathed is putting a positive spin on it. I'm bright red today. Still.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>77th over: England 273-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 58, Swann 40)</strong> Tahir's back and England's blood is up. They're running everything, desperately milking this old ball for all they can. They run a quick one to leg slip then decide not to chance Steyn's arm for two to square leg. Prior slightly mistimes a straight drive and, rather than the four he hoped for, can only get two. No matter, he sweeps again and sweeps hard, sending the spinner to the backward square leg boundary. I'm simply not printing any emails saying \"Could they?\" Just so you know.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>78th over: England 281-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 65, Swann 41)</strong> Graeme Smith does look worried now. He brings on Morkel, who presumably he had been saving for the new ball. Swann has a mighty heave at his first one and follows it with a grim smile. He settles for running a single to third man before Prior mistimes a slap to the same area and is lucky no-one is underneath it. Next he chips Steyn at mid-on by an inch for a four. Were Morkel still fielding there, he would have been tall enough to take it. A wild slog at one that bounces over middle stump follows. This is nuts. Two overs to the new ball. </p> <p>\"Tell Smyth if he loses I'll gladly chip in a bob or two,\" emails Richard Woods. \"This is fun.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 282-8 (Swann run out [Duminy] 41)</strong> Tahir is still coming over the wicket, still whizzing it into the rough. England are still swinging. Swann runs a very tight single to backwards point and the fielder hurls it in. Tahir throws it at the stumps and Swann's gone by an inch.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>79th over: England 283-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 67, Anderson 0)</strong> Swann stuttered for a second before going, unsure if the run was on. Had he gone straight from the get-go? He might have made it. Can Anderson make up for that dropped catch yesterday? Smyth's fondling Ingle's two quid with a little more conviction now.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 283-9 (Prior 67 c Duminy b Morkel)</strong> Oh no. <strong>WAIT</strong> Taufel goes to the third umpire to check for the no ball ... And Morkel has overstepped. Prior is walking back to the middle. <strong>NOT OUT</strong> Prior chipped one high into the sky and the ball was well taken in the deep by Duminy. He walked off, dismayed, and then sprinted back to the middle. <strong>It's 284-8.</strong></p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>80th over: England 286-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 67, Anderson 2)</strong> You've got to feel for South Africa there. Morkel looks sick. He bowls a tight line at Anderson, who scampers through for a single. Prior can't nick a single to get down to the other end and take the strike next over. They thought it was all over with that catch. Here comes the new ball. It probably is now...</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>81st over: England 288-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 69, Anderson 2)</strong> With Anderson on strike, Smith hasn't taken the new ball, expecting Tahir to put the ball into the rough outside the left-handed Anderson's off stump and spin him out. Anderson is polite to his first two, then hoicks a sweep to midwicket for one. Prior comes charging down the wicket, misses and De Villiers takes off the bails. It's gone upstairs ... <strong>NOT OUT</strong> But, my word, that was tight. Very, very tight. Prior works away a two then, attempts to get up the other end off the last ball and the entire Lord's crowd shout \"NO!\" at the top of the voices. Luckily, he gets back in time.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>82nd over: England 293-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 73, Anderson 3)</strong> Steyn takes the new ball. He begins with a short dose of outright filth down the leg side. Might have been called a wide by an uncharitable umpire. He follows it up with another short one to Anderson's ribs. He prods it down to point and there's another tight run. Umpire Dharmasena goes upstairs but Prior was home by a foot. Steyn hurls down another wide one, drifting away - exactly the ball that Prior out in the first innings. Not sure it was intentional though. The next one is: an absolute jaffa - starting off on middle and, with a combination of bounce and swing, ending up way outside off. Unperturbed, Prior cuts classily to the boundary off his next. England need 53.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 294-9 (Prior c Smith b Philander)</strong> There's no denying this one. Nicked to the slips. Philander has already rapped Anderson on the pads, getting the new ball to dart wildly in the air. Prior came forward to a well-pitched up ball and simply feathered to Smith in the slips, who took it in his fingertips. What an innings by Prior.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>IT'S ALL OVER! England 294 all out (Finn c Kallis b Philander 0)</strong> South Africa win by 51 runs, the series 2-0 and go to No1 in the world. Finn gets a goldie, Philander gets a five-for and has a good shout of the man of the match award. It was nice while it lasted - both the Test and England's No1 status - but South Africa have played brilliant cricket all series and for all of this test. The better team won, and the better team is the best team in the world.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>\"The only person</strong> to blame here is the person who decided that this should be a three Test series only,\" emails Daniel Chisnall. A three Test series to decide the best team in the world. It would have been lovely to see this played out over five, especially after this Test - one of the best in recent years. The South Africans look jubilant, Strauss congratulates them but there's just something in his manner, just a little hint, that he's been worn down by this. It would be a great shame if this was his Test in charge, a great shame.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>Dropped catches?</strong> Yes, dropped catches didn't help. But arguably this series was lost at The Oval. South Africa came out in utterly dominant mood and didn't take their foot of England's throat, not helped by England's dismal performance. It's hard to force someone else to choke if they've got their foot on your windpipe.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>\"Does this mean</strong> that Philander is now on a hat-trick until the next time he plays England in a Test?\" asks Sam Walton. No - hat tricks can carry over two innings but not Tests.</p> <p>Here are the ICC Test standings, incidentally:</p> <p>1. South Africa 120 <br>2. England 117<br>3. Australia 116<br>4. Pakistan 109 <br>4. India 104</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>The various suits</strong> are on the podium, doling out the gongs. Taufel and Dharmasena both, oddly, get the same commendation for wildly differing games. Philander is quite rightly awarded the man of the match award - though it would have been interesting to see whether Prior would have got it had England pulled this off. Big Vern says: \"We always knew that getting two balls in the right area would do it for us\" and, boy, did he get two key balls in the right area this evening. \"Did you enjoy having those left handers in your sights this series,\" asks presenter Atherton. \"Oh yeah,\" says Big Vern.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>Matt Prior</strong> is given the prize for England's player of the series. He looks as though he's been awarded a big kick in the swingers. He says: \"It almost hurts more when you get that close. Not being able to get over the line in the end was very disappointing. Broady played beautifully, Jonny Bairstow started it off for us.\" What was he thinking when he was reprieved by Morkel's no ball? \"Maybe it is my day ... but it wasn't to be. \" He adds: \"I have to say congratulations to the South Africa team,\" before saying \"catches win matches and we put those vital catches down ... back to the drawing board.\"</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>Hashim Amla</strong> wins the man of the series for South Africa without much competition. Were you starting to get twitchy tonight, asks Athers. \"Yes,\" he says. \"Moments like this make cricket what it is. It's been a great advert for Test cricket.\" Of his triple hundred at Lord's. \"It's a bit of a blur, it was a while back. I'm very glad I got to start the series well and end it well too ... The wicket [at Lord's] was good to bat on and small partnerships mattered. We managed to scrap a bit and we're really chuffed to get over the line.\"</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>Here's Andrew Strauss:</strong> \"It was an outstanding Test match, some first class cricket by both teams. I thought the spirit and never say die attitude the guys showed was a great credit to them. South Africa thoroughly deserve their victory ... unfortunately for us South Africa were better than us but full credit to them for being so.\"</p> <p>He pays tribute to Swann, Prior and Jonny Bairstow and, asked how he looks back at England's year at the top of the world rankings, he says he doesn't look at it \"with a great deal of fondness\". \"We'll come back though. When you reach number one you've got to up your performance, you can't rest on your laurels. Although I can't fault the effort the guys have put in, in certain areas we weren't on the ball.\"</p> <p>Atherton asks: are you the man to take England back to the top of the rankings? \"Well, I hope so.\"</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>Here's Graeme Smith:</strong> \"It was a top Test match. Both teams played really well and England played with a great deal of freedom. We had to work really hard. It was wonderful to come through, a great feeling.\"</p> <p>The no ball, the stumping? \"You start having those nervous moments but you've got to stay focused. We always knew the new ball gave us an opportunity and Vernon got it perfect.\"</p> <p>On the series - what made the difference? \"We were able to post totals, build partnerships and get scores on the board. That allowed our bowlers to bowl with freedom and get rewards. We caught well.\"<br> <br>There's a message to his wicket keeper Mark Boucher scribbled on his chest and he takes a minute to say of him: \"He's been an integral part of the Proteas and this series victory is for him.\" He also mentions the death of the miners in South Africe: \"I know our nation is in mourning and a lot of guys lost their lives. I'd just like to let them know we're thinking about them too.\"</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>That's it:</strong> a brilliant Test match comes to an end, as does a fascinating series. Both the on pitch performances (and a certain somebody's off-pitch performances) have been headline-worthy but South Africa have been the better team by far, away from home, and facing a much vaunted Test attack with their most familiar conditions. Well done South Africa, well played England too. See you in India. Well, after the ODIs, the world Twenty20s, and all the nonsense. But this is Test cricket. And boy, what Test cricket it was.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican candidate at the centre of a firestorm over his claim that \"legitimate rape\" rarely results in pregnancy is facing growing pressure to stand down as the row threatens to undermine both the party's White House and Senate campaigns.&#xa0;</p> <p>Todd Akin, a Tea Party-backed congressman from Missouri who is running for the US Senate, was rounded on by senior members of his own party, as well as his Democratic opponent and women's groups.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president, used <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/314452/romney-akins-inexcusable-comment-robert-costa\">an interview with the National Review Online</a> to denounce Akin in unusually forthright language that throws into doubt Akin's survival as a candidate. &#xa0;</p> <p>\"Congressman Akin's comments on rape are insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong,\" Romney said. \"Like millions of other Americans, we found them to be offensive.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I have an entirely different view. What he said is entirely without merit and he should correct it.\"</p> <p>But he stopped short of calling for Akin to step down.</p> <p>Republican senator Scott Brown became the first member of the party to break ranks and call publicly for Akin to resign. \"Rep Akin's statement was so far out of bounds that he should resign the nomination for US Senate in Missouri,\" Brown said in a statement.</p> <p>Brown's response is not surprising, given he is well to the left of the party, fighting to retain his seat in a tight race in liberal Massachusetts.</p> <p>Wisconsin senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ron4Senate/statuses/237582523465596928\">Ron Johnson also called for Akin to pull out</a>. On Twitter he said: \"Todd Akin's statements are reprehensible and inexcusable. He should step aside for the good of the nation.\" </p> <p>His intervention is potentially significant as vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan is from Wisconsin and the latest poll suggests Romney has taken a narrow lead over Obama in the state.</p> <p>But even figures such as Karl Rove, George W Bush's strategist, told Fox News that Akin's \"got some real explaining to do\".</p> <p>Barack Obama's campaign team portrayed the comments by Akin as further evidence of what it has dubbed the Republican 'war on women'.&#xa0;</p> <p>The row began when Akin, in an interview with the St Louis channel KTVI-TV broadcast on Sunday,&#xa0;was asked about his opposition to abortion, even in the case of rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>\"It seems to me, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" Akin replied. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something: I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.\" </p> <p>Akin won the Republican primary only this month with the backing of Tea Party groups. The Missouri race, against Democratic Senator Clare McCaskill, was seen as one of the most winnable for the Republicans in its bid to take control of the Senate.</p> <p>Akin is only narrowly ahead in the polls and pollsters predicted his remark is almost certain to lose him a lot of votes, especially among women.</p> <p>But the row could also have implications for the White House campaign as it has focused attention on an area of sensitivity for Romney: the views on abortion of his running mate Paul Ryan. </p> <p>In a statement released after Akin's remarks, Romney's campaign team said: \"Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin's statement, and a Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.\"</p> <p>But the statement leaves questions about Ryan unanswered. Until the statement was released Ryan had been opposed to abortion even in the case of rape. Ryan was the co-sponsor of a House bill last year called 'No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act' that included what it referred to as \"forcible rape\", though the phrase was later dropped after a backlash from women's groups.</p> <p>The Obama campaign, which has successfully dictated the agenda of the White House race over the last few weeks, is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6MTwBlJk5E&amp;feature=player_embedded \">running a campaign ad in swing states</a> focusing on Romney and Ryan's views on abortion. The ad said Romney had made his VP choice but \"what choice will women be left with?\"</p> <p>The ad says that both Romney and Ryan support proposals to outlaw abortion even in the case of rape and incest.</p> <p>Romney has an ambiguous record on abortion, promising while campaigning for governor of Massachusetts not to change existing law but adopting&#xa0;a tougher position when campaigning to become the Republican presidential nominee. </p> <p>Ryan, by contrast, has been consistently opposed to abortion in almost all circumstances.</p> <p>The row is a distraction the Romney-Ryan team did not need as the two were campaigning Monday in New Hampshire.&#xa0;On the stump together, they sought to discuss Medicare, an issue on which they are vulnerable, anxious to have the debate now rather than later in the campaign, and the slowness of the economic recovery.</p> <p>Akin, later on Sunday, partially backtracked from his earlier remarks, saying he had been speaking off the record and had \"misspoke\". <br>&#xa0;<br>He added: \"I recognise that abortion, and particularly in the case of rape, is a very emotionally charged issue. But I believe deeply in the protection of all life, and I do not believe that harming another innocent victim is the right course of action.\"</p> <p>His opponent, Claire McCaskill, a close ally of Obama, said that Akin had not addressed several issues, including his comment that women's bodies closed down during rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>She called on Akin to apologise for that and other contentious statements, but rather than join the calls for him to quit she warned the Republican leadership that any attempt to oust him as the candidate would backfire. </p> <p>\"I think for Washington party insiders to come in and try to invalidate the votes of Missourians would be radical,\" McCaskill said <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/claire-mccaskill-todd-akin-legitimate-rape_n_1810351.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">in a phone interview with The Huffington Post</a>. </p> <p>McCaskill, seeking re-election, was widely regarded as vulnerable but her opponent's remarks play into her strategy of painting him as an extremist, provided he remains the candidate.&#xa0;</p> <p>Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the Democratic National Committee, sought to broaden the issue beyond Missouri politics, accusing Republicans of wanting to \"take women back to the Dark Ages\".</p> <p>She added: \"The real issue is a Republican party \u2013 led by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan \u2013 whose policies on women and their health are dangerously wrong.\"</p>",

Naturally I don't want to be disrespectful here, but it's always the owners. The dogs are just behaving like dogs, and if there's one thing a dog doesn't like, it's being squashed into a narrow space with lots of other dogs, and this fight took place in a long corridor at Balmoral. It could have been a fairly wide corridor, probably wider than your average hallway, but narrower than a lovely open field, and perhaps not the best place for dogs to meet.</p> <p>Think how you would feel if you were a dog. You're going along your corridor, in your own home, on your way into your own garden, in your pack of six, and then along come three dog visitors, without being invited by you. Six is a pleasant pack, nine is a crowd. No wonder there was a bit of a fight. Or a lot of a fight, with loads of blood. But ears do bleed a lot. I know because my dog was once bitten on the ear \u2013 it kept shaking its head until it looked like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and frightened everyone in the vet's waiting room.</p> <p>And I have experience of an aggressive little dog attacking a harmless big one. On holiday, aged 12, my tremendously good-natured boxer dog, Lusty, was viciously attacked by a Scottie. For no reason that I could see. And they were out in a large stable yard. There wasn't even the excuse of a corridor.</p> <p>Anyway, there were all the royal dogs in this corridor, a fight breaks out, the \"dog boy\", who was in charge, loses control, and who gets picked on? Poor Max, an elderly Norfolk terrier. Ghastly, but only natural. Dogs don't have to like every other dog they meet. And they tend to pick on the weak. All a human can do is try to keep calm, and although you're not officially meant to put your hand into the fight, you can't really just let them get on with it, and it's not easy to catch hold of a fighting dog's collar, because they whip about like a mad snake. I do feel very sorry for everyone involved, and hope that Max gets better soon. But if there's a silver lining, it's that \u2013 for once \u2013 it's not one of the usual suspects.</p>",
  "<p>As the South Korean Olympic team head home from London 2012 with 28 medals, they may be reflecting on the challenges they faced balancing the pressure of a nation to win, with competing in a responsible and fair way in the Games. This is comparable with the pressure companies have to generate profit whilst operating responsibly in emerging markets like South Korea.</p> <p>Corruption continues to be a key challenge for a business seeking to operate responsibly in South Korea. Ranked by <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Transparency International</a> in 2011 as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/01/corruption-index-2011-transparency-international\" title=\"\">43rd most corrupt country</a> out of 182, recent reports have questioned the effectiveness of anti-corruption law in South Korea and its enforcement. According to <a href=\"http://www.herbertsmith.com/Locations/HerbertSmithAsiaRegion/Default.htm\" title=\"\">a report from Herbert Smith</a> on anti-corruption in Asia, South Korea's Act on Preventing Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transaction has only led to nine convictions in 13 years. Few Korean companies are revealing data on political 'donations' (comparable to facilitation payments in the West) in their CR reports.</p> <p>However, there is evidence that combating corruption is moving up the South Korean agenda. Just this week, the country's anti-corruption agency announced that it will seek to introduce a law that would mean government officials caught accepting more than 1 million won ($883) worth of bribes or entertainment could face punishment of up to three years in prison even without evidence of influence peddling. Disgraced officials would also need to pay back five times the amount they received. In addition, lobbyists and civil servants will incur significant fines if they are found to have sought illicit favours from public officials, whether or not any money was involved. It is therefore imperative for companies operating in South Korea \u2013 particularly for those with a presence in the UK \u2013 to ensure that there are strong anti-bribery and corruption policies and procedures in place.</p> <p>To date, much of South Korea's economic prosperity has been on the back of conglomerates - or chaebol \u2013 such as LG Electronics and Samsung. The governance structure of the chaebol has traditionally been complex with little transparency and many chaebol executives having a strong presence in the political arena. However, in the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis\" title=\"\">Asian Financial Crisis of 1997</a>, South Korean society's attention has turned to the role of business in society and the importance of ethical and transparent management. While there has been some reform in governance of the chaebol, relationships between them and politicians remain close and the resulting lack of transparency can be challenging when trying to do business with them.</p> <p>As with other emerging Asian markets, cultural influences stemming from for instance, traditional Korean Confucianism and Buddhism, have significant influence over employees' behaviour in the workplace. Reflecting the Confucian values of loyalty to one's group, 'whistleblowing' \u2013 or naebu gobalja \u2013 carries negative connotations that are associated with betraying your employer more than with protecting the public good. The government has demonstrated commitment to reversing this perception and has recently introduced an Act on the <a href=\"http://www.theioi.org/news/korea-acrc-implements-act-on-the-protection-of-the-public-interest-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">Protection of Public Interest Whistleblowers</a>. The Act came into force in September 2011 and is designed to protect individuals who report violations of the public interest to certain prescribed bodies (eg their employer) against suffering 'disadvantageous measures'. Disadvantageous measures could include dismissal, disciplinary action or other employment-related bias against a whistleblower. Companies need to ensure they have effective non-retaliation policies in place and support the government's efforts in this area.</p> <p>Non-profit organisations and South Korean consumers are showing greater interest in corporate responsibility activities including environmental protection. Research by the <a href=\"http://english.korcham.net/\" title=\"\">Korean Chamber of Industry and Trade</a> in 2007 found that 80% of 500 business people survey stated that they preferred to buy goods from companies that champion social causes. And <a href=\"http://www.greengrowth.go.kr/english/\" title=\"\">Korea's Green Growth plan</a> includes the objectives of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% of its previously projected growth by 2020, increasing the share of renewable energies in its total energy supply to 11% by 2030, and promoting the development of 27 core green technologies that would provide future engines of growth for its economy. There are high expectations on businesses to contribute to this and address the problem of environmental degradation which has arisen from periods of unrestrained and rapid economic growth. Companies entering the South Korean market should bear this in mind and ensure they uphold high environmental standards.</p> <p><em>Judith Irwin is a senior researcher at the </em><a href=\"http://www.ibe.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Institute of Business Ethics</em></a><em>.

  "<p>International news groups have been careful to keep their enthusiasm in check when reporting the Burmese government's claim that it has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19315806\" title=\"\">abolished media censorship after 48 years</a>. The <strong>BBC</strong>'s initial enthusiasm for the story \u2013 it ran as a lead bulletin on the 24-hour news channel and prominently online \u2013 has cooled through the day. Monkey hears that the BBC's troops on the ground in Burma successfully talked down bosses in London, advising that the country remains heavily restrictive for the media. By 4pm in the UK, the BBC had dropped the story from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/\" title=\"\">front page of its website</a>. Now that's what you call international diplomacy.</p>",
  "<p>Well, that didn't last long, did it? The victory parades have barely begun, and already the midsummer dream is rudely shattered. No more talk of herculean efforts to win gold, no more hammering of iron rings of fire, no more warm fuzzy feelings towards our national broadcaster.</p> <p>No, it's back to being depicted as a nation of slack-jawed lummoxes incapable of a decent day's work, and to Iain Duncan Smith accusing the BBC's economics editor Stephanie Flanders of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/19/iain-duncan-smith-bias-bbc\" title=\"\">\"peeing all over British industry\"</a>, after she failed to greet falling unemployment figures with unquestioning wonderment. So much for the legacy.</p> <p>In fairness to the five Tory MPs who first pricked the bubble, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/tory-backbenchers-urge-welfare-reforms?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">via leaked excerpts from their forthcoming book</a> arguing that we're not the nation of champions we had giddily begun imagining but \"among the worst idlers of the world\", this wasn't quite the plan.</p> <p>Perhaps provocative references in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a> to people preferring \"a lie in to hard work\" will look less inflammatory in context, or at least in season (the book's due out in September, traditional month of noses back to grindstones and party conference tub-thumping). But still, the politics of idleness deserves unpicking.</p> <p>Here's a test: does the word \"idle\", when used by politicians, instinctively set alarm bells ringing? If so, you're probably left of centre, because it's an indisputably Tory buzzword \u2013 reeking of Norman Tebbit's father <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/7858570/Norman-Tebbit-my-father-got-on-his-bike-to-look-for-a-job.html\" title=\"\">getting on his bike </a>and rightwing tabloids haranguing welfare \"scroungers\", stirring in leftwing breasts the old fear of attack on the vulnerable.</p> <p>But if it's that word \"vulnerable\" which gets your hackles up then you're probably right of centre, because vulnerability is a Labour buzzword \u2013 reeking for you of excuses to do nothing, of lily-livered bleating about why the welfare state couldn't possibly be reformed which ultimately traps those it purports to protect. You probably cheered when Eric Pickles ditched the term \"vulnerable families\" (Whitehall speak for impoverished families with multiple social problems) for \"problem families\", saying it was time to stop making excuses. For the right, the word \"vulnerable\" smacks of victimhood, of ducking blame and not holding individuals accountable for their actions.</p> <p>Because that's really the difference between \"vulnerable\" and \"idle\". The first suggests that being broke or desperate is at least partly to do with external circumstances, which may need help to overcome; the second suggests it's your own dumb fault. \"Vulnerable\" resonates for those who believe in the transformative power of the state; \"idle\" for those who believe in the power of individuals.</p> <p>And what's giving the politics of idleness a new lease of life is the marriage of an ancient Tory belief \u2013 that anyone can haul themselves up by their bootstraps, that failure means you're not trying hard enough \u2013 with a newly fashionable argument about the decline of the decadent west and rise of the industrious east.</p> <p>The young Tory turks are busy weaving a narrative not just of individual moral failing (too many workshy scroungers) but of national degeneration: a sense that we've been spoiled by&#xa0;years of easy money and need a collective kick up the backside. It's intimately connected to austerity politics, with its inference that only rich countries can afford to go this soft.</p> <p>The idea that developed nations have grown fat and lazy with prosperity, and that only the children of hungry tiger economies still understand the value of hard graft, is quietly embedding itself in political culture. Think Michael Gove raiding Singapore's education system for ideas on toughening up exams; or even the Indian steel magnate Ratan Tata, complaining last year that his company's western workers were overfond of their leisure and blaming <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/Ratan-Tata-slams-Corus-JLR-managers-work-ethics/Article1-700349.aspx\" title=\"\">\"a certain comfort level that comes from a country that has had good times\"</a>. (Tata is shortly to retire but says at 75 his life's work won't be done, a sentiment of which the Britannia Unchained quintet would doubtless approve.)</p> <p>It's not clear yet exactly who these pampered slackers supposedly dragging Britain down are, beyond familiar vague complaints of a bloated public sector and kids \"more interested in pop music and football\" than in becoming lawyers. Perhaps inevitably, they exist now more in the realm of anecdote \u2013 the intern who thinks she's above making the coffee, young men scorning the menial jobs subsequently snapped up by immigrants \u2013 than hard fact.</p> <p>And while Britain does, as the book's authors say, have unusually short average working hours, that's mainly because we have an unusually high percentage of part-timers, many of whom want fulltime work but can't find it. (Those working fulltime still do some of the longest hours in Europe.) Perhaps all those frantically juggling part-time mothers of small children \u2013 the ones who a generation ago wouldn't have worked at all \u2013 are to be deemed lazy? But there's a bigger problem with the politics of idleness than quibbling over definitions.</p> <p>Hauling ourselves out of recession might indeed be as easy as demanding everyone pull their socks up, if declining GDP really was just a fancy name for indolence.</p> <p>But the many dull technical reasons why value of output per worker might fall \u2013 from the shrinking of highly productive sectors like the City to the rise of self-employed freelances commanding a lower hourly rate than they did as staffers \u2013 aren't solved by simply clocking up more hours. Our challenges are not those of tiger economies, suggesting their recipe of working harder for longer for less won't necessarily work miracles here.</p> <p>Yet for exploring this complicated new reality in her Newsnight report, Flanders was accused by the work and pensions secretary of \"carping and moaning\", running down an \"incredibly robust\" private sector. It's apparently fine to call individuals lazy, but not to suggest any flaw in modern labour markets.</p> <p>And perhaps that's partly because doing the latter suggests we may be vulnerable (that word again) to global economic trends beyond our immediate control \u2013 trends not so easily reversed by the classic Tory formula now being touted for unleashing our inner tiger, namely slashing employment regulations and cutting benefits. Idle, or vulnerable? The story we believe&#xa0;about&#xa0;ourselves has wider implications than we think.</p>",

Listen here</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Stockholm.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> David Kyhlberg (voice, music).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> David Kyhlberg's recordings as Picture mark the return to this column of Cascine, the label that brought us Chad Valley, Selebrities, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/14/new-band-jensen-sportag\" title=\"\">Jensen Sportag</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/27/new-band-day-rxgibbs\" title=\"\">RxGibbs</a> among other excuses to dust off superlatives about shiny opulence and such. Picture is not Kyhlberg's first venture: he was one half of Swedish duo Sail a Whale, who released the A Documention EP, described as \"one of the prettiest, saddest and most euphoric records\". What Sail a Whale did and what Kyhlberg does as Picture aren't exactly artistically miles apart going by the <a href=\"http://www.songbird.me/#artists/sail-a-whale-4fde0e59735cf1426f00003b\" title=\"\">track we've heard</a>. Ecstatic rising tumults of keyboards and chorales is what Kyhlberg trades in, and no matter how hard he might try, that would appear to be his default compositional and recording style.</p> <p>Whatever he does, it sounds as though it took a lot of work to achieve. You know when you see a band sweating and toiling onstage as they attempt to recreate their sound? If you were to compress all that effort, it would probably equal the toil that goes into constructing the average Picture song. Don't be fooled by the lack of \"conventional\" instrumentation: those synthesisers don't play themselves, those computers aren't self-programming, the beats don't just appear as if by magic and those layers and layers of billowing sound don't pile on top of each other without a little guidance.</p> <p>The music on Picture's debut EP, True, is quite filmic, but it's not all ebbing and flowing ambience. And we're not sure what movie it would soundtrack: something about fast travel through European cities, but nobody would pay to watch that, unless it also involved chase sequences and violence, and Picture's music is too \u2026 picturesque for that. A lot of it is quite danceable, and the dance style in question is \u2013 what? Electro? House? Trance? All or none of the above. We've seen some reviewers compare it to shoegazing, others to the systems music of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/30/steve-reich-bloc-weekender\" title=\"\">Steve Reich</a> with its attendant \"repetitive musical phrases that shift in and out of unison\".</p> <p>Everything Time is the opener with the seraphic vocals and the house piano that emerges from the astral fog. It's beaty and beatific, Kyhlberg singing about waking up with the sun in his eyes, and it sounds simultaneously euphoric and defeated. True is the lead track, and you can see why that one is being pushed. It is where the rumbling sadness of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmcJ7_orLmc\" title=\"\">Radio Dept</a> meets the wan waft of chillwave, and it skitters along at a drum'n'bass pace as Kyhlberg traces a distinctive pop melody with his voice. The vocals, by the way, are uniformly evanescent. Not Evan Dando, no \u2013 evanescent. Third is glacial synth-pop, like Cocteau Twins in a sonic cathedral with Pet Shop Boys. And Malmo City Tunnel \u2013 named after a rail line beneath that city \u2013 is ethereal trance. We believe that may be a new genre.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Aeronautical synths floating over Balearic soundscapes\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://nofearofpop.net/2012/07/picture-true/\" title=\"\">nofearofpop.net</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> If David Guetta was a Swedish chillwaver \u2026</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Have an epiphany.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Use an <a href=\"http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone.gc\" title=\"\">Epiphone</a>.</p> <p><strong>What to buy: </strong>The Picture EP is out now on Cascine.</p> <p><strong>File next to: </strong>Tough Alliance, Sail a Whale, Radio Dept, Enya.</p> <p><strong>Links: </strong><a href=\"http://cascine.us\" title=\"\">cascine.us</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday's new band:</strong> Dena.</p>",
  "<p>The court-ordered release on Friday by Oracle and Google of details about any bloggers or commentators whom they retain produced no surprises: the database giant said that it \"retained\" Florian M\u00fcller, author of the Foss Patents blog, while Google said that it has not directly paid anyone to comment \u2013 although Oracle alleged in its filing that Google \"maintains a network of direct and indirect 'influencers'\" to advance its intellectual property agenda.</p> <p>In the filing, which had been ordered two weeks ago by Judge Alsup as part of the fallout from the Oracle-Google trial, <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/103156715/Oracle-Google-1236\">Oracle said</a> that it has \"retained\" M\u00fcller \"as a consultant on competition-related matters, especially relating to standards-essential patents.\" </p> <p>M\u00fcller posted about that retainer on his blog in April; Oracle says he wasn't retained to write about the case. \"Mr Mueller [sic] is a frequent critic of Oracle and was a leading advocate against Oracle's acquistion of Sun Microsystems,\" it says in the filing. </p> <p>Neither the amount, nor the date from which any payments have been made, were revealed. M\u00fcller has previously said that he is receiving payment from Microsoft for research into patents.</p> <p>Oracle said that while some Oracle employees blogged about the case, they weren't asked to do so. It added that Professor Paul Goldstein of Stanford University advises [Oracle lawyers] Morrison &amp; Foerster and is the author of the treatise \"Goldstein on Copyright\". Professor Goldstein, it said, \"has not commented on this lawsuit\". </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/103156715/Oracle-Google-1236\">Google says in its filing</a> that neither the company nor its lawyers have paid any \"author, journalist, commentator or blogger to report or comment on any issues in this case.\" Nor has it offered or asked for any quid pro quo coverage of the case. It excludes bloggers who might use Google's AdSense system on their own blogs because \"it is possible that any number of individuals or organisations \u2026 might have expressed views regarding this case.\" </p> <p>It has asked Judge Posner to specify who else the judge might want. Again, it says, it has not paid \"any individuals or organisations\" to report or comment on any issues in the case.</p> <p>Alsup, who presided over the Oracle-Google trial earlier this year, ordered the disclosure in a one-page order issued on 7 August, in which he wrote that: \"The court is concerned that the parties and/or counsel herein may have retained or paid print or internet authors, journalists, commentators or bloggers who have and/or may publish comments on the issues in this case.\" </p> <p>That provoked some perplexity over the extent to which he believed the jury might have been influenced by anything they read before or during the case. It also raised questions about whether such demands might infringe on the freedom of speech of anyone who turned out to be paid by those organisations.</p> <p>Alsup has still given no reason for why he requested the disclosures over the trial, which was heard before a jury.</p> <p>Google said it has made philanthropic payments to universities and non-profit organisations, where \"at least some \u2026 have representatives who have elected to comment or opine on the issues in this litigation, even though Google did not pay any of those representatives to provide that commentary.\"</p> <p>But Oracle disputed Google's hands-off claims, writing in its submission: \"Oracle notes that Google maintains a network of direct and indirect 'influencers'; to advance Google's intellectual property agenda. This network is extensive, including attorneys, lobbyists, trade associations, academics, and bloggers, and its focus extends beyond pure intellectual property issues to competition/antitrust issues.\" It alleges that \"Google brought this extensive network of influencers to help shape public perceptions concerning the position it was advocating throughout this trial.\" </p> <p>It alleged that Ed Black, head of the CCIA (<a href=\"http://www.ccianet.org/\">Computer and Communications Industry Association</a>), a pressure group which it says is \"funded in large part by Google\", and has written specifically on the extent of copyright of APIs \u2013 a key issue in the trial which Oracle lost on almost every count. The CCIA's members also include Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook and Fujitsu.</p> <p>Oracle also raises a query about Jonathan Band, co-author of a book called \"Interfaces on Trial 2.0\", cited by Google in its copyright brief on 3 April 2012 for the trial. Band, it says, has an \"indicated relationship to Google\" through Google-supported trade associations. </p> <p>Oracle did not specify which, if any, trade associations it funds or supports.</p> <p>Chris Watson, a partner and social media expert at law-firm CMS Cameron McKenna, commented: \"It is unlikely a similar case to this would occur in the UK due to most civil cases not involving juries. </p> <p>\"However, there have been criminal cases in the UK where a jury has had to be discharged due to the concern that social media articles could influence their verdict and so risk contempt of court, which shows that judges are aware of the power of social media to shape debate on legal proceedings.\"</p> <p>Of the prospects for possible guidelines or regulation, Watson said: \"We have seen examples of celebrity product endorsements on Twitter being banned by the UK Advertising Standards Authority, so there is no reason why blog posts, whether paid-for or on a retainer basis, should not also be censured if they are deemed to constitute stealth advertising. </p> <p>\"The introduction of standardised guidelines on what is and isn't acceptable advertising behaviour would help make it clear to both social media content creators and corporate marketing departments the code of conduct they are expected to follow. </p> <p>\"In Australia, for instance, regulators have recently put the onus on companies to police all comments made on their Facebook brand pages, which suggests how regulation in this area could develop in the UK.\"</p> <p>M\u00fcller, however, uses Google's Blogger service, which is hosted in the US, where the First Amendment would mean that he could ignore any strictures on commentary that UK or other countries might want to place. </p> <p><strong>Oracle filing</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/103156715/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-1sqegznpzp3p13gphmm1\"> <a title=\"View Oracle Google 1236 on Scribd\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/103156715/Oracle-Google-1236\" style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;\">Oracle Google 1236</a><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/103156715/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-1sqegznpzp3p13gphmm1\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.772727272727273\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_36024\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Google filing</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/103156715/content?start_page=1&amp;amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;amp;access_key=key-1sqegznpzp3p13gphmm1\"> <a title=\"View Oracle Google 1236 on Scribd\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/103156715/Oracle-Google-1236\" style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;\">Oracle Google 1236</a><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/103156715/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-1sqegznpzp3p13gphmm1\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.772727272727273\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_65603\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Chinese and Japanese nationalists are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/china-protest-japan-senkaku-diaoyo-island\" title=\"\">actively asserting their country's claims over the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands</a>, sparking protests and a heated diplomatic row between the two countries. To outsiders, it might seem as if this is a relatively new dispute, which started with the Tokyo governor's recent announcement in April that he would purchase the rocky islets. In fact, tensions have been brewing since at least <a href=\"http://japanfocus.org/-Gavan-McCormack/3464\" title=\"\">September 2010</a>, when a Chinese fishing boat rammed Japanese coastguard patrols and unleashed a bilateral crisis.</p> <p>That same year, China started to take a more assertive approach towards Japan by increasing its aerial and law enforcement presence in disputed waters to demonstrate its sovereignty. Many Chinese strategists perceive Japan to be a former empire continuing on a downward slide while China's star is rising, and the rise of hardline voices in Japan has led many Chinese analysts to call for more resolve in Beijing. From the Chinese perspective, the time is right to respond resolutely and stake its ground in this dispute with its eastern neighbour.</p> <p>In Japan, public attitudes towards China deteriorated drastically in 2010, in what is known there as the \"China shock\". It happened when China eclipsed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, and began to adopt a more hardline approach to maritime disputes. This resulted in an upsurge in Japanese nationalist sentiment, culminating in campaigns to name, and more recently to purchase, disputed islands. On a strategic level, concerns about China's rising military and economic power have prompted Tokyo to broaden its regional network by engaging Pacific countries and multilateral forums such as Asean, while strengthening its own defence capabilities and stepping up security co-operation with the US.</p> <p>Chinese hardliners see these moves as Japan's willingness to act as a proxy of the US in its efforts to contain China's rise and expand US presence and influence in the Asia-Pacific region. In Japan, what is perceived as China's determination to restructure the regional landscape is fuelling nationalist anxiety about Japan's ability to defend its territory against a Chinese expansion.</p> <p>Nationalism makes sovereignty in the East China Sea a highly explosive issue, much more so than the South China Sea for example. Due to the link with atrocities committed during the Japanese invasion, sentiments over the status of the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands run deeper in the Chinese psyche than any other territorial dispute in modern Chinese history. Japan, on the other hand, feels threatened by China's rise, and fears that its territorial sovereignty might be eroded. Therefore, incidents surrounding these islands strike directly at historical wounds, stirring national pride and constricting the already narrow space for diplomatic manoeuvre.</p> <p>Public opinion is a double-edged sword, particularly for China. Beijing tries to use it to justify assertive actions and coax other countries to compromise, but it also faces the tricky dilemma of satisfying increasingly outspoken and critical citizens. Last week's <a href=\"http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201208200105\" title=\"\">dramatic landing of Hong Kong activists</a> on the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands was widely applauded on microblogging sites, which soon called for more anti-Japanese protests.</p> <p>But other internet users also raised doubts about the Chinese government's determination and capability to protect its territorial claims, going so far as to ask for military intervention. China fears these protests could turn into criticism of the government, as has happened in the past.</p> <p>While neither Beijing nor Tokyo desires a large-scale conflict, there is deepening pessimism on both sides over the prospects of a peaceful settlement to the Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute. And the deep strategic mistrust that characterises relations between the two countries is currently aggravated by their respective domestic political turmoil. While Japan's leaders are navigating a fragmented and shifting political landscape, the Chinese leadership is steering a delicate power transfer, limiting the capital available to either Tokyo or Beijing to go significantly against populist or nationalist sentiment.</p> <p>Neither side is willing to initiate the much-needed call on the bilateral hotline established precisely for this type of situation. The longer the two sides let the tension brew, the harder they will find it to prevent the dispute from boiling over.</p>",
  "<p>I had intended to open this polemic with some version of this true story: earlier this summer, I was having dinner with friends and our conversation turned to the role of the veil in Islam, starting with how to explain a burkha to a son raised to believe that men and women are equal, before leading into the veil's potential as a form of oppression against women.</p> <p>The friends I was having dinner with were two women, one a Palestinian raised in Jordan, the other English raised as a Muslim, and as our conversation progressed, it turned into how - for a number of reasons, some of them perhaps very good - it is far easier for them to discuss the issue of the veil publicly than me, a white western male, no matter how nuanced or well-intentioned my views.</p> <p>Now, this is exactly the kind of thing I want to talk about today: the things we disallow ourselves to discuss. But a funny thing happened. I found myself drafting and re-drafting the way I opened with that anecdote again and again and again, working so hard to make sure my role in that conversation was clearly understood - and therefore impossible to misunderstand - that I found myself pounding the sentences into such painfully careful neutrality that they would end up meaning almost nothing.</p> <p>But why? Why did I obviously think such care necessary, even while being painfully aware of the irony of this being a polemic about censorship?</p> <p>Part of my hesitation is of course my own genuine impulse not to be in any way racist, a truly held wish to accommodate cultures and views not my own. There is also my desire not to have this polemic be just another tediously calculated controversy, like the ones <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/18/martin-amis-england-moral-decrepitude\">Martin Amis seems to pull out</a> every time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/12/martin-amis-katie-price-lionel-asbo\">he's got a new paperback on the way</a>.</p> <p>But if I'm honest, isn't part of it also fear? Fear of having whatever I'd say about the Islamic veil - no matter how thoughtfully I'd said it - misappropriated, misquoted or badly paraphrased in the inevitable tweeting that's going on right this very second? Fear of having my words turned into something they aren't, and having to suffer the consequences.<br>Anti-Censorship arts poster<br>Because the price of being misunderstood is very high. In the online world, nothing can be unsaid and nothing is off the record. And once you're forced, fairly or not, to start saying something like, \"I'm not a racist,\" haven't you lost the legitimacy of your voice forever? Is that something a writer can risk?</p> <p>What I've done, though, by being so careful, by even perhaps keeping silent on this or any issue, is disallowed myself a real voice in the conversation. I who consider myself a brave writer, one unafraid to push boundaries, to speak truth to power, I who believe these things about myself as much as any of you, I have in this instance self-censored. In a polemic about self-censorship.</p> <p>And my argument to you today is that, paradoxically, this form of where every voice is heard. What we disallow ourselves to discuss - sometimes for good reason, yes, but sometimes for bad - can curtail our voices as effectively as any government or corporation ever could.</p> <p>Now, the larger issue of censorship, by those very governments and corporations, is still obviously a huge one. But what I've faced with this polemic is what Mary McCarthy grappled with in 1962 when she delivered it. She said, \"I imagine it has occurred to the audience ... that there is not going to be much problem with today's topic as there can't be too much disagreement.\"</p> <p>Fifty years later, she's still right. I could easily have given an impassioned 15-minute talk about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/16/china-censorship-internet-freedom\">China's censorship of the internet</a>, for example. Or how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/sep/29/banned-books-week\">book-banning in schools remains a persistent problem in the US</a>, even in 2012. I could have spoken of the hate tweets to Tom Daley or Louise Mensch or Fabrice Muamba. Or the disgrace of the Pussy Riot trial in Moscow. Or Great Britain's own problems with censorship: its outdated libel laws, its alarming flair for super-injunctions, its plans for secret courts, and on and on.</p> <p>Censorship has not left the world. It only finds new avenues.</p> <p>But as in 1962, these are all easy things to rise in opposition to, without much risk, without possibly even disagreement. Would we agree here today that Salman Rushdie has the right to produce The Satanic Verses? Would we agree that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/24/salman-rushdie-jaipur-festival-cancel\">his recent experience during the Jaipur Literary Festival</a> is a depressing blow against free speech?</p> <p>There might be a few dissenters, but I suspect on the whole, we'd rally around Rushdie, and loudly - and proudly - claim our right and willingness to speak on any issue at any time.</p> <p>But would we be correct?</p> <p>Ask yourself, truthfully, would you sit down tomorrow morning and start writing a novel with Mohammad as your central character? A Mohammad treated as a fallible man rather than a prophet? A Mohammad perhaps even criticised?</p> <p>This is a different question than should you be able to write this book. Because I suspect, again, that we would probably agree here in this room - if perhaps less so in the world at large - that of course you should, if the need to tell that story was great enough. But who here actually would?</p> <p>Or consider something more benign, at least on the surface. However ashamed you might be to admit it, has the threat of a <a href=\"http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/badsex.html\">Bad Sex Award</a> ever made you pause while writing a sex scene? It's entered my mind, and<br>frankly, it pissed me off. I wrote the scene anyway, of course, but even the thought that I'd momentarily hesitated made me angry.</p> <p>For the record, I loathe the Bad Sex Award. I think it started as a funny idea, but in order to gain headlines and get writers like Haruki Murakami on the list, the otherwise intelligent people who - I hesitate to say \"judge\" it - have to temporarily pretend they understand neither context nor tone. So rather than what the Bad Sex Award could be - a discussion on how sex can be written honestly - it is instead an occasion for tittering and humiliation of the most public school kind.</p> <p>However, having said that, have I now guaranteed that every bit of sex I might ever write will automatically be scrutinised by the Bad Sex Award? Does that enter my mind before both writing a sex scene or criticising the Award itself? Do I have to make the conscious decision not to self-censor rather than write freely, as an artist should?</p> <p>What about if you're here today, among what is probably - correct me if I'm wrong - a fairly politically liberal gathering. What if you're here in this group, and you believe deeply in the freedoms I argue for: freedom of speech, the battle against censorship.</p> <p>But what if you're also, say, against abortion? For you, it's a moral position you can't budge, no matter how socially liberal you otherwise consider yourself to be. In your heart, you believe abortion to be the taking of a life. Would you venture to speak that opinion here? Would you write a work of art that espoused that opinion?</p> <p>Now, this is interesting, because I suspect you might not. But what if you did? What if you expressed that opinion here in a thoughtful but clear way? That opinion would have consequences, wouldn't it?</p> <p>We'd like to pretend it wouldn't. I imagine we here think of ourselves as open-minded and accommodating to points of view other than our own, but how would an anti-abortion writer be received in a group like this? Politely, respectfully, I'd imagine. But within that politeness, would that writer's opinions on other topics be ignored because some of us would secretly think he or she is \"not one of us, not really\"?</p> <p>Because this is the other self-censoring problem growing with the interconnectedness of the world. Instead of bringing us all together in an omnipresent, multi-faceted discussion, the internet instead has made sectarianism an almost default position. The nature of mass debate has become solely binary: you're on one side or the other. Factor that in with whatever combination of debates you've been forced to take sides on, and the number of people willing to listen to you - because they agree with you - shrinks daily. Try stating a strong opinion on gun control, for example, on Twitter and see how many followers you lose.</p> <p>That's not the only example. This polemic is going on the Guardian website, and though no one really wants to say so out loud, most of us seem to accept these days that the comments on the Guardian on articles like this, while occasionally containing interesting replies, are far more often the domain of outraged point-missers, incandescently furious pedants, and trolls who don't bother reading past the sub-headline.</p> <p>And again, did I pause about whether to include that paragraph, knowing this article will have comments beneath it? I did. More importantly, have I, by all that frankly liberating name-calling, just committed the same crime myself by dismissing any discussion I find unpalatable?</p> <p>Because this is the kind of risk you run by saying something like that opinion about abortion. We here would almost certainly argue for your right to hold it, but in this sectarian, connected world, we'd then maybe stop listening to you. In a way, you'd be suddenly free of censorship because you'd be able to say whatever you like, you'd just be saying it to fewer and fewer people. And importantly, you'd be left out of conversations you'd like to be having.</p> <p>Can an artist do this? Should an artist? Certainly, there are artists who are happy to talk to their own small sect in exchange for complete freedom to say whatever they will. But isn't the pushing of an artist into a small sect also a kind of censorship? And if chosen by the artist, isn't it a kind of self-exile? Of giving up on engaging? Of possibly even changing things because you're no longer part of a discussion that might?</p> <p>For example, if you're a writer who wants to affect the world and engage with a large audience, would you risk being marginalised in the US by talking about your atheism? Would you risk the same marginalisation in England by talking about your devout Christianity?</p> <p>Would you loudly proclaim a pro-Israeli position in Europe? Or a pro-Palestinian one in the US? Or go anywhere in the world and suggest Israel and Palestine may both have dirty hands?</p> <p>Now, of course there's a natural elision between what we say in private versus what we say in public, but in a time where everything you say is now said to the entire world, are there areas where you've allowed that elision to justify not speaking what you see as the truth to save yourself from the consequences that could result?</p> <p>How does an artist speak freely in this environment? I don't have a simple credo that answers this. I press on, I try hard, I work to say what I want to say in a way that keeps my voice both heard but also truthful, also standing up for what I believe in the most effective way I can. But I don't always get it right, I don't always make myself proud, and most importantly, I find that the struggle grows daily in the way the world now connects.</p> <p>And so I ask you today, what do you not say? What do you censor when you write? Because I'm afraid I can't believe that you don't. You may be willing to do some of the things I've mentioned today, but all?</p> <p>I like to think of myself as a fearless writer, and I'm sure that you all do, too. But are we really challenging ourselves enough to keep that true?</p> <p>I don't think the question behind censorship today is any longer should you be able to say these things. Nor is it even a question so much anymore of if you <em>can</em>. The question has become, if you <em>do</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/\">Edinburgh World Writers' conference</a>, hosted jointly by the Edinburgh International Book festival and the British Council, runs from 17-21 August, with contributions from Ali Smith, Irvinw Welsh, China Mi\u00e9ville and Patrick Ness</p>",
  "<p>A shop worker has been jailed for 30 months for trying to falsely claim a customer's winning lottery ticket worth \u00a31m.</p> <p>Farrakh Nizzar, 30, checked 77-year-old Maureen Holt's ticket at a convenience store in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and told her she had won nothing. When he asked whether she wanted the ticket back, Holt and her husband, Fred, told him to discard it.</p> <p>Later, Nizzar phoned a lottery hotline to say he had purchased the ticket from the Best One shop where he worked, but subsequent checks showed Holt had purchased it from a Tesco Express in the town using her Clubcard.</p> <p>At Oldham magistrates court in July, Nizzar admitted fraud by false representation. Passing sentence at at Manchester's Minshull Street crown court , the recorder Philip Cattan said: \"This goes to the heart of public confidence in the National Lottery. The courts must demonstrate to you and to others that this type of fraud will be met by significant custody.\"</p> <p>Camelot, the National Lottery operator, carried out security checks on Nizzar after he claimed the prize, and called in police when suspicions arose. It has since removed its lottery terminal at the Best One shop, which is run by Nizzar's cousin.</p> <p>Detective Constable Kate Carnally, of Greater Manchester police, said Nizzar's actions were \"foolish at best, and at worst extremely cruel\".</p> <p>She said: \"He knew this woman had a winning ticket and chose to lie to her, deliberately duping her out of a life-changing sum of money that would have meant financial security for her and her husband into their retirement.\"</p> <p>It had been callous and underhand, she said. \"Thankfully he did not get away with his scam,\" and the genuine owner of the ticket \"has been paid out what was always rightfully hers\".</p> <p>The Holts said: \"We are glad that justice has been done and that this matter is now behind us. We can now look forward to enjoying our lottery win and spending some time with our family and friends.\"</p> <p>Camelot said such incidents were rare, with millions of transactions taking place daily.</p> <p>\"We take matters of propriety very seriously,\" it said. \"In order to do this, we adhere to the highest standards in player protection. Our operations and processes are subject to the scrutiny of our internal auditors, independent external auditors and representatives from our regulator, the National Lottery Commission.

  "<p>It is not difficult to guess which animal the town of Sawai Madhopur has tethered its fortunes to. Fancy a drink? Pop into the Tiger bar at the Taj hotel. Want to rest your head? Try the Tiger Moon Resort. Want to shop? There are tiger-print pyjamas, aprons, tablecloths, bedspreads. Little in this Rajasthani town has not succumbed to tiger mania.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged on a stage by the main road last Saturday, Yadvendra Singh handed over his business card, decorated, of course, with orange and black stripes. Since 1992 he has run Tiger Eye Adventure Tours, taking visitors from around the world on safari inside the nearby Ranthambore national park.</p> <p>But for the past three weeks, Singh has not been allowed in the park to check on the 27 adult tigers and 25 cubs who call it home. No one has, after India's supreme court issued an order banning tourism in all core tiger habitats.</p> <p>The decree was temporary, until 22 August, when the court meets again to assess whether tigers and tourists can co-exist in India. The decision will have ramifications not just for India's approximately 1,700 tigers, but for the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Indians whose livelihoods depend on the big cats.</p> <p>\"I couldn't believe it,\" said Singh. \"I've spent 20 years, half my life, doing this. And suddenly I'm supposed to find a new job.\"</p> <p>But Singh, and many environmentalists and conservationists, insist the real losers will be the creatures who have helped pay his bills for two decades. \"If the ban on tourism continues, it will be the end of the tiger in India,\" he said. \"We're the ones who put energy into tracking them. We deter poachers. Tourists are only allowed in the park for six hours every day, but we guides take it in turns to patrol the park from sunrise to sunset. Voluntarily.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394980815\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/20/1345457089159/Map-Indias-tiger-reserves-001.png\" alt=\"Map: India's tiger reserves\" width=\"460\" height=\"552\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map: India's tiger reserves</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Belinda Wright, executive director of the Wildlife Protection Society of India, based in New Delhi, said a tourist ban would be a \"total disaster\".</p> <p>Stressing she was pro-tiger rather than pro-tourist, she said: \"There is no way the forestry department alone can protect tigers from poachers and local encroachment on the land.\"</p> <p>The Corbett Foundation, another wildlife protection charity in India, agrees. \"While in principle, we all agree that wildlife tourism in India needs to be controlled and strictly regulated, placing a complete ban on any kind of tourism activities in the core areas will certainly not help the wildlife of the tiger reserves,\" it <a href=\"http://corbettfoundation.blogspot.in/2012/08/is-complete-ban-on-wildlife-tourism-in.html\" title=\"\">said in a statement</a>.</p> <p>Since the court's judgment on 24 July, Singh has not earned a penny. Along with dozens of other guides and drivers who feed their families by servicing the tiger tourists who flock to Ranthambore every year, he has been holding a roadside protest to remind the authorities how integral tigers are to the town.</p> <p>There are no reliable figures to show how many tourists visit Sawai Madhopur each year, but in 2011, 288,000 tickets were sold to enter the national park. Demand is much higher, say locals, but numbers are restricted so a maximum of 40 vehicles carrying a total of 520 tourists are in the park at any one time.</p> <p>The interim order has hit hard, said Goverdhan Singh Rathore, a doctor who runs a free hospital from the profit made from his guest house, Khem Villas. \"We've already had 10% of bookings for next season cancelled,\" he said, sitting in the courtyard of his house, which is decorated with orange and black striped tiles. \"Forty per cent of guests have asked us to let them know what happens on the 22nd. If the ban is extended, next season is over.\" He would have to close the hotel, and the hospital, which treated 90,000 patients last year, he added.</p> <p>Ajay Dubey, a campaigner who filed the petition to the supreme court, said all he was doing was asking it to enforce the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act. He claims the act prohibits tourism in India's tiger breeding areas. \"By God's grace I just want respect of rule of law \u2013 nothing else,\" he said in an email.</p> <p>No one was enforcing the law, Dubey added, and with tragic results. He points to the central state of Madhya Pradesh (MP), which has six tiger reserves. \"There were 700 tigers in MP in the year 2000; now the number has come down to 257,\" said Dubey. \"It speaks volumes.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Tiger conservation is being adversely affected by mindless tourism; the large number of vehicles loaded with people were traumatising the endangered species in the critical tiger habitat.\"</p> <p>But Wright said Dubey was using unreliable figures. \"Until the 2008 census, the tiger population was calculated using a discredited, unscientific method which allowed states to dramatically overestimate,\" she said over the phone in Delhi.</p> <p>The law says tiger reserves should have a core area that only forestry officials enter, surrounded by buffer land that can be visited by tourist vehicles. In April, the court ordered 13 states with tiger parks to file their zoning plans. Only three complied, amid difficulties in creating the buffers related to land acquisition, compensation for relocated villagers and local politics.</p> <p>Angered by the states' poor response, on 24 July the supreme court made an interim order banning all tourism from the core zones until the states complied. They have until 22 August to do so, until which time interested parties, such as guides and state governments, can submit evidence arguing why they believe tourists should be allowed in core areas.</p> <p>In Ranthambore that means not just the 393 sq km national park but also just over 900 sq km of adjoining land. YK Sahu, divisional forest officer at Ranthambore, said he believed that the presence of believes tourists saved tigers rather than endangered them.</p> <p>\"Look at where our tigers live. Just 6% to 10% of the park is visited by tourists, and yet it is in those areas where tigers flourish.\"</p> <p>Tourists also report illegal wood cutting, he said, and help deter poachers. \"If the Taj Mahal was not a tourist site, would it look as it does in its present form?\", he asked. \"All of the marble would have been stolen by now.\"</p> <p>Rathore, whose father, Fateh, founded the non-governmental organisation Tiger Watch and who was one of India's most renowned tiger experts until his death last year, said there was \"not one scrap of evidence\" to prove tourists kill tigers, directly or indirectly, or hamper their breeding. In fact, he claims, \"the relationship between the presence of tourists and the number of tigers is not inversely proportional, but directly proportional.\" In 2005-06, the park had 26 tigers. Despite increasing tourism, the population risen to 53.</p> <p>\"People make up their mind that tourism is bad for tigers without consulting science. They see a picture of a queue of jeeps filled with tourists with long lens cameras pointing at a tiger and they say, 'poor tiger'. But how do they know that the tiger is unhappy? Maybe the tiger is enjoying it. Ecology tells us that when a creature is upset, they stop breeding. Yet in Ranthambore the tiger population has increased with tourism.\"</p> <p>The supreme court seems to want the tiger states to restrict tourism to the buffer zones. But the problem in Ranthambore, as well as other reserves, is that the only area it can designate as buffer is not somewhere tourists would want to visit \u2013 let alone tigers. There, the buffer is a wilderness with very little flora or fauna, littered with gravel mines. To reach the zone, tigers would have to travel 35 miles from the main park, and even cross main roads.</p> <p>There are also many people living in the buffer \u2013 62 villages have been relocated there from the core area since the 1970s. Before tiger tourism came to the area, they made their living chopping down trees in the tiger reserve and, in some cases, poaching tigers to serve the lucrative Chinese medicine market.</p> <p>In Kanha national park, a tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh, tribal people this week held a protest against the tourism ban. \"<a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/protest-against-ban-on-tiger-tourism/242855\" title=\"\">You do what you can to earn a living, whether that means cutting down trees \u2026 or even hunting tigers</a>,\" one man told NDTV.</p> <p>Back in Ranthambore, August is always a lean month because most of the park is closed anyway during the monsoon. But some tourists usually come to visit the three zones that normally remain open, and fears are widespread about the effect of a permanent ban on the community.</p> <p>\"It's not just the guides who will be affected,\" said Singh as he protested by the roadside. \"It's the mechanics who service the jeeps, the hawkers who sell T-shirts, the hoteliers, the women who make handicrafts.\"</p> <p>\"If tourists are not allowed in the core tiger zone, our economy will collapse,\" said Satish Jain, who has been a guide in the park since 1997.</p> <p>\"Our economy is based on tourism. It has to be \u2013 a lot of people used to be employed in a cement factory, but that was closed because of the national park. There was a gas bottling plant, but that was shut down too. How do they expect us to earn a living?\"</p> <h2>Tiger facts<br></h2> <p>India is home to half the world's tiger population. According to the latest census released in March 2011 by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the current population is estimated at 1,706 \u2013 up from 1,411 in 2008, but a long way off the 45,000 which reportedly roamed India 100 years ago.</p> <p>In India, the tiger is found in 18 states, from the Himalayas in the north to Tamil Nadu in the south and across the north-east into Burma.</p> <p>They occupy a variety of habitats including tropical evergreen forests, deciduous forests, mangrove swamps, thorn forests and grass jungles.</p> <p>A total of 923 tigers were killed by poachers between 1994 and 2010, according to the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI).</p> <p>An undercover investigation by the WPSI and the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) in 2005 revealed that the trade in tiger and leopard body parts in China continues to thrive.</p>",
  "<p>The US government has long maintained, reasonably enough, that a defining tactic of terrorism is to launch a follow-up attack aimed at those who go to the scene of the original attack to rescue the wounded and remove the dead. Morally, such methods have also been widely condemned by the west as a hallmark of savagery. Yet, as was demonstrated yet again this weekend in Pakistan, this has become one of the favorite tactics of the very same US government.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.policeone.com/terrorism/articles/86852-FBI-Again-Warns-of-Secondary-Explosive-Devices-Cautions-Officers-To-Watch-Surroundings/\">2004 official alert</a> from the FBI warned that \"terrorists may use secondary explosive devices to kill and injure emergency personnel responding to an initial attack\"; the bulletin advised that such terror devices \"are generally detonated less than one hour after initial attack, targeting first responders as well as the general population\". Security experts have long noted that the evil of this tactic lies in its exploitation of the natural human tendency to go to the scene of an attack to provide aid to those who are injured, and is specifically potent for sowing terror by instilling in the population an expectation that attacks can, and likely will, occur again at any time and place:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'The problem is that once the initial explosion goes off, many people will believe that's it, and will respond accordingly,' [the Heritage Foundation's Jack] Spencer said \u2026 The goal is to 'incite more terror. If there's an initial explosion and a second explosion, then we're thinking about a third explosion,' Spencer said.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a494447.pdf\">2007 report</a> from the US department of homeland security christened the term \"double tap\" to refer to what it said was \"a favorite tactic of Hamas: a device is set off, and when police and other first responders arrive, a second, larger device is set off to inflict more casualties and spread panic.\" Similarly, the US justice department has highlighted this tactic in its prosecutions of some of the nation's most notorious domestic terrorists. Eric Rudolph, convicted of bombing gay nightclubs and abortion clinics, <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2005-07-18/justice/rudolph.sentencing_1_eric-rudolph-emily-lyons-birmingham-bombing-and-three?_s=PM:LAW\">was said</a> to have \"targeted federal agents by placing second bombs nearby set to detonate after police arrived to investigate the first explosion\".</p> <p>In 2010, when WikiLeaks published a video of the incident in which an Apache helicopter in Baghdad killed two Reuters journalists, what sparked the greatest outrage was not the initial attack, which the US army claimed was aimed at armed insurgents, but rather the follow-up attack on those who arrived at the scene to rescue the wounded. From<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\"> the Guardian's initial report</a> on the WikiLeaks video:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A van draws up next to the wounded man and Iraqis climb out. They are unarmed and start to carry the victim to the vehicle in what would appear to be an attempt to get him to hospital. One of the helicopters opens fire with armour-piercing shells. 'Look at that. Right through the windshield,' says one of the crew. Another responds with a laugh.</p> <p>\"Sitting behind the windscreen were two children who were wounded. </p> <p>\"After ground forces arrive and the children are discovered, the American air crew blame the Iraqis. 'Well it's their fault for bringing kids in to a battle,' says one. 'That's right,' says another.</p> <p>\"Initially the US military said that all the dead were insurgents.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the wake of that video's release, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/06/wikileaks-iraq-killing-vi_n_527383.html\">international condemnation</a> focused on the shooting of the rescuers who subsequently arrived at the scene of the initial attack. The New Yorker's Raffi Khatchadourian <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2010/04/the-wikileaks-video-and-the-rules-of-engagement.html\">explained</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"On several occasions, the Apache gunner appears to fire rounds into people after there is evidence that they have either died or are suffering from debilitating wounds. The rules of engagement and the law of armed combat do not permit combatants to shoot at people who are surrendering or who no longer pose a threat because of their injuries. What about the people in the van who had come to assist the struggling man on the ground? The Geneva conventions state that protections must be afforded to people who 'collect and care for the wounded, whether friend or foe.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He added that \"A 'positively identified' combatant who provides medical aid to someone amid fighting does not automatically lose his status as a combatant, and may still be legally killed,\" but \u2013 as is true for drone attacks \u2013 there is, manifestly, no way to know who is showing up at the scene of the initial attack, certainly not with \"positive identification\" (<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/drones-yemen_b_1458668.html\">by official policy</a>, the US targets people in Pakistan and elsewhere for death even without knowing who they are). Even commentators <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/36106_Wikileaks_Video_Provokes_Debate_Over_War_Crimes\">who defended</a> the initial round of shooting by the Apache helicopter by claiming there was evidence that one of the targets was armed typically noted, \"the shooting of the rescuers, however, is highly disturbing.\"</p> <p>But attacking rescuers (and arguably worse, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/07/unrestrained_savagery/\">bombing funerals of America's drone victims</a>) is now a tactic routinely used by the US in Pakistan. In February, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/\">documented</a> that \"the CIA's drone campaign in Pakistan has killed dozens of civilians who had gone to help rescue victims or were attending funerals.\" Specifically: \"at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims.\" That initial TBIJ report detailed numerous civilians killed by such follow-up strikes on rescuers, and established precisely the terror effect which the US government has long warned are sown by such attacks:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Yusufzai, who reported on the attack, says those killed in the follow-up strike 'were trying to pull out the bodies, to help clear the rubble, and take people to hospital.' The impact of drone attacks on rescuers has been to scare people off, he says: 'They've learnt that something will happen. No one wants to go close to these damaged building anymore.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Since that first bureau report, there have been<a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/06/04/cia-revives-attacks-on-rescuers-in-pakistan/\"> numerous other documented cases</a> of the use by the US of this tactic: \"On [4 June], US drones attacked rescuers in Waziristan in western Pakistan minutes after an initial strike, killing 16 people in total according to the BBC. On 28 May, drones were also reported to have returned to the attack in Khassokhel near Mir Ali.\" Moreover, \"between May 2009 and June 2011, at least 15 attacks on rescuers were reported by credible news media, including the New York Times, CNN, ABC News and Al Jazeera.\"</p> <p>In June, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un\">said</a> that if \"there have been secondary drone strikes on rescuers who are helping (the injured) after an initial drone attack, those further attacks are a war crime.\" There is no doubt that there have been.</p> <p>(A different UN official, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, Ben Emmerson, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/us-should-hand-over-footage-of-drone-strikes-or-face-un-inquiry-8061504.html\">this weekend demanded</a> that the US \"must open itself to an independent investigation into its use of drone strikes or the United Nations will be forced to step in\", and warned that the demand \"will remain at the top of the UN political agenda until some consensus and transparency has been achieved\". For many American progressives, caring about what the UN thinks is so very 2003.)</p> <p>The frequency with which the US uses this tactic is reflected by<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/tariq-khan-killed-cia-drone/story?id=15258659#.UDIo592PXdQ\" \"> this December 2011 report from ABC News</a> on the drone killing of 16-year-old Tariq Khan and his 12-year-old cousin Waheed, just days after the older boy <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2133282/The-boy-sitting-photos-protesting-deadly-US-drone-strikes--Three-days-later-killed--US-drone-says-Jemima-Khan.html\">attended a meeting</a> to protest US drones:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Asked for documentation of Tariq and Waheed's deaths, Akbar did not provide pictures of the missile strike scene. Virtually none exist, since drones often target people who show up at the scene of an attack.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Not only does that tactic intimidate rescuers from helping the wounded and removing the dead, but it also ensures that journalists will be unwilling to go to the scene of a drone attack out of fear of a follow-up attack.</p> <p>This has now happened yet again this weekend in Pakistan, which witnessed what Reuters <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/us-drone-strikes-kill-pakistan\">calls</a> \"a flurry of drone attacks\" that \"pounded northern Pakistan over the weekend\", \"killing 13 people in three separate attacks\". The attacks \"came as Pakistanis celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan with the festival of Eid al-Fitr.\" At least <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/424117/us-drone-strike-kills-four-militants-in-pakistan-officials/\">one of these weekend strikes</a> was the type of \"double tap\" explosion aimed at rescuers which, the US government says, is the hallmark of Hamas:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At least six militants were killed when US drones fired missiles twice on Sunday in North Waziristan Agency. </p> <p>\"In the first strike, four missiles were fired on two vehicles in the Mana Gurbaz area of district Shawal in North Waziristan Agency, while two missiles were fired in the second strike at the same site where militants were removing the wreckage of their destroyed vehicles.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>An unnamed Pakistani official identically <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jRSgGVNqSXm9i7ML3c7FDBM7djDw?docId=CNG.c1edd15a728475879a106e5c12399c08.c1\">told Agence France-Presse</a> that a second US drone \"fired two missiles at the site of this morning's attack, where militants were removing the wreckage of their two destroyed vehicles\". (Those killed by US drone attacks in Pakistan are <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/02/deliberate_media_propaganda/\">more or less automatically deemed</a> \"militants\" by unnamed \"officials\", and then uncritically called such by most of the western press \u2013 a practice that inexcusably continues despite revelations that the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/singleton/\">has redefined</a> \"militants\" to mean \"all military-age males in a strike zone\".)</p> <p>It is telling indeed that the Obama administration now routinely uses tactics in Pakistan long denounced as terrorism when used by others, and does so with so little controversy. Just in the past several months, attacks on funerals of victims have taken place <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/middleeast/yemen-suicide-attacks-toll-rises.html?_r=2\">in Yemen</a> (purportedly by al-Qaida) and <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/06/more-than-70-killed-by-car-bombing-at-funeral-in-syrian-town.html\">in Syria</a> (purportedly, though without evidence, by the Assad regime), and such attacks \u2013 understandably \u2013 sparked outrage. Yet, in the west, the silence about the Obama administration's attacks on funerals and rescuers is deafening.</p> <p>But in the areas targeted by the US with these tactics, there is anything but silence. Pakistan's most popular politician, Imran Khan, has generated intense public support with his scathing denunciations of US drone attacks, and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/237147226189729792\"> tweeted the following</a> on Sunday:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394957490\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345464840397/khan.png\" alt=\"Khan\" width=\"536\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As usual, US policies justified in the name of fighting terrorism \u2013 aside from being rather terroristic themselves \u2013 are precisely those which fuel the anti-American hatred that causes those attacks.</p> <p>The reason for the silence about such matters, and the reason commentary of this sort sparks such anger and hostility, is two-fold: first, the US likes to think of terror as something only \"others\" engage in, not itself, and more so; second, supporters of Barack Obama, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, simply do not want to think about him as someone who orders attacks on those rescuing his victims or funeral attendees gathered to mourn them.</p> <p>That, however, is precisely what he is, as this mountain of evidence conclusively establishes.</p>",
  "<p>Asil Nadir, for almost 20 years Britain's most famous fugitive from justice, has been found guilty of three counts of theft relating to his time as the boss of the Polly Peck empire which collapsed in 1990.</p> <p>The 71-year-old, who built the sprawling, stock market-listed conglomerate from scratch, was accused of stealing almost \u00a3150m from the Mayfair-based group he allegedly ran \"in an autocratic manner\", according to the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution.</p> <p>The trial has taken seven months, hearing evidence from many elderly and retired businessmen giving their recollection of events that took place more than two decades ago. The jury \u2013 down to just three women and seven men after two jurors were excused during marathon evidence sessions \u2013 deliberated for seven days before the judge indicated he would accept a majority verdict of nine to one.</p> <p>At that point the jury indicated they had reached unanimous verdicts in relation to four of the 13 counts in the indictment against Nadir \u2013 acquitting him on one and convicting him on three. The jury are now continuing their deliberations in relation to the remaining counts.</p> <p>During the trial, counsel for the SFO, Philip Shears QC, told the court of a wide pattern of repeated thefts, but said the prosecution focused on a small amount of that alleged behaviour relating to the transfer of \u00a334m. Nadir denied all 13 charges.</p> <p>Proceeds from years of alleged thievery are said to have gone on buying shares for himself, paying off personal tax bills and other debts linked to him or his associates.</p> <p>At the start of the trial Shears explained to the jury why they were hearing evidence relating to events long forgotten by many. \"Why are you trying matters so long ago? The answer is simple. He [Nadir] was due to stand trial in late 1993 but in May of 1993 he fled the country to northern Cyprus, thus leaving the jurisdiction, only to return in August 2010.\"</p> <p>Nadir was a hero among City investors in the 1980s, rapidly transforming a sleepy East End rag trade firm into a multinational conglomerate with interests in food, electronics, textiles and leisure. Its best-known brand was the Del Monte fruit group, and among its directors was Sir Michael Sandberg.</p> <p>At the heart of the prosecution case is a series of transfers to subsidiaries of Polly Peck in Turkey and Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, which Shears said were disguised in order to mask the fact they were for the benefit of Nadir or his associates.</p> <p>Operations in these two territories, especially those of Polly Peck's carton packaging firm Unipac, came to be the main profit generators within the group. However, they were also divisions over which Nadir allegedly had the most control. Unipac was run by Nadir's brother-in-law and was not audited by Polly Peck's accountants, Stoy Hayward.</p>",

That's a good thing. That fear motivates me, and I enjoy that fear. I'm perverse in that way.\" Scott's take on film-making as an adrenalised, intimidating experience in itself was reflected in the tone and pace of his box-office hits, which included Top Gun (1986), Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) and Days of Thunder (1990).</p> <p>A lover of fast cars and motorbikes on the screen and off, and a lifelong rock climber, Scott was adept at injecting thrills into his slick films. This approach rarely brought him critical acclaim and his movies were sometimes unfavourably compared with the more ambitious, philosophical works of his older brother Sir Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator (2000) and Prometheus (2012). Unlike Ridley, he was never nominated for an Oscar. Nonetheless, several of Tony's films were rewarded with huge commercial success as audiences bought wholeheartedly into his vision. He has died at the age of 68 after jumping from a bridge in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Scott was born in North Shields, Tyne and Wear, the youngest of the three sons of Colonel Francis Percy Scott, who served in the Royal Engineers, and his wife, Elizabeth. Ridley was seven years Tony's senior; the oldest brother, Frank, was a sailor. Like Ridley, Tony attended Grangefield school, Stockton-on-Tees, and West Hartlepool College of Art (now Cleveland College of Art and Design). He completed a fine arts degree at Sunderland Art School (now the University of Sunderland). At 16, he starred as a boy playing truant in the short black-and-white film <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/496936/index.html\" title=\"Review of Boy and Bicycle\">Boy and Bicycle</a> (1965), directed by Ridley, who was studying at the Royal College of Art. Tony also attended the college and graduated with the intention of becoming a fine artist.</p> <p>However, in the late 1960s the pair established Ridley Scott Associates, a TV commercial production company. \"Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first,\" recalled Ridley. \"I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him, 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did.\" Scott duly became a prolific director of commercials. By the early 1980s, a number of British directors who had also started out on advertisements were making an impact in Hollywood. Alan Parker (Midnight Express, 1978), Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire, 1981), Adrian Lyne (Flashdance, 1983) and Ridley (particularly with his science fiction epics Alien, 1979, and Blade Runner, 1982) all paved the way for Tony's feature-film career.</p> <p>It had begun humbly with a television adaptation of Henry James's short story The Author of Beltraffio in the mid-1970s. Despite its visual style, his first feature film, The Hunger (1982), which starred David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve as lovelorn vampires, failed to make much of an impression with critics. Roger Ebert called it \"an agonisingly bad vampire movie, circling around an exquisitely effective sex scene\". That scene, featuring Deneuve and Susan Sarandon, helped the film gradually acquire something of a cult following.</p> <p>A commercial led to Scott being hired for his next, and most enduring, feature. The producers <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/obituary-don-simpson-1325371.html\" title=\"Don Simpson obituary in the Independent\">Don Simpson</a> and Jerry Bruckheimer had seen a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM3woO0AbCw\" title=\"Scott's Saab TV advertisement\">TV car advertisement</a> in which Scott depicted a Saab 900 racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. The pair approached him to direct Top Gun, a romantic thriller about a naval pilot in training, with a charismatic cast headed by Tom Cruise. Scott delivered a film that glamorised the sleek contours of the military hardware and is powered by rapid-fire editing and a big-hair, big-shoulderpads pop soundtrack, making it one of the quintessential 80s films. Top Gun was made for $15m and returned more than 20 times that amount.</p> <p>Looking back, Scott explained that he and his countrymen found it difficult to be accepted in Hollywood. \"We were criticised about style over content \u2026 I was constantly being criticised, and my press was horrible. I never read any press after The Hunger.\" Despite the bad reviews, his career as a director of action movies took off rapidly with Beverly Hills Cop II; Revenge (1990), a Mexico-set crime flick starring Kevin Costner; and Days of Thunder. Along with Top Gun, the last of these best epitomises Scott's early directing style. Switching from fighter aircraft to the Nascar auto-racing circuit, with Cruise once more in the lead role, Scott admitted with refreshing candour that it was difficult to generate on-screen excitement from an event that essentially involves cars driving around in circles. \"The real speed comes from the cutters [editors] and what they do with the celluloid,\" he said.</p> <p>In True Romance (1993), scripted&#xa0;by Quentin Tarantino, Scott replaced technological glitz with sharp dialogue, and proved that he could direct an ensemble cast with panache. The matchless lineup included Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/may/29/dennis-hopper-obituary\" title=\"Dennis Hopper obituary\">Dennis Hopper</a>, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt and Gary Oldman. He then settled into directing a sequence of moderately entertaining, star-powered thrillers such as Crimson Tide (1995), The Fan (1996) and Enemy of the State (1998), each with apocalyptic tones and convincing performances (from Denzel Washington, Robert De Niro and Will Smith respectively).</p> <p>None was as blatant in their worship of fast, dangerous machinery or as broad in their emotional brushstrokes as the earlier films had been, and they performed less well at the box office as a result. But what they did gain was subtlety and sophistication: Crimson Tide featured characterful interplay between Washington and Gene Hackman, and was enhanced by its claustrophobic submarine setting, while Enemy of the State weaved a dense plot of paranoia and conspiracy.</p> <p>Scott reteamed with Washington for Man on Fire (2004), Deja Vu (2006), The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), a remake of the 1974 hostage thriller of the same name, and Unstoppable (2010). Man on Fire and Domino (2005) revealed his increasing ability to probe the depths of a complex character: an ex-CIA operative with a death wish in the former, and an unlikely bounty hunter, portrayed by Keira Knightley, in the latter. He was maturing as a director.</p> <p>Along with Ridley, he was an executive producer on the TV series Numb3rs (2005-10) and The Good Wife (2009-12). They also worked together on the film The A-Team (2010), directed by Joe Carnahan, who credited Scott as a mentor.</p> <p>Scott's first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, the actor Donna Scott, who appeared in several of his films, and their sons, Frank and Max.</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 Anthony David Scott, director and producer, born 21 June 1944; died 19 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>'I escaped from Homs in February,\" said Abu Mohammed as his three children played in a nursery yard in Damascus. \"We moved to Seida Zeinab and then that was bombed last month.\" All over the Syrian capital, in schools, hotels and houses, tens of thousands of people who have fled their homes because of war are now living in misery. They include hundreds who moved from other cities to what they thought was the safety of Damascus and have had to flee again.</p> <p>Attacks on the capital's outlying districts continue relentlessly. In the leafy residential streets of central Damascus, the crump of distant artillery is a regular sound. People no longer shrink in horror but merely shrug and carry on.</p> <p>The cafes halfway up the tawny brown ridge of Mount Qassioun, which stretches along the city's northern edge, remain open but visitors have to pass army checkpoints to get there, under the big guns on the plateau above.</p> <p>As destruction creeps nearer, the mood has changed dramatically in the six months since I was last here. People on all sides \u2013 government sympathisers, opposition supporters and civilians who waver in the middle \u2013 all feel that Syria has become a victim and a plaything taken over by foreigners. \"The situation is no longer in the hands of Syrians. We are pawns in a big game,\" said Youssef Abdelke, a leading artist.</p> <p>Whatever awaits them in the next few months, whether a change of regime, a political compromise or \u2013 the most likely scenario in the minds of people I spoke to \u2013 a further intensification of war, they feel it will be decided by outsiders.</p> <p>Discussion among Damascenes no longer centres on whether to support change or stick with the status quo for fear that the alternative to Bashar al-Assad's regime will be worse. The focus is on priorities. Which objective is more urgent: to stop the killing or to topple a regime that has shown greater resilience than many predicted?</p> <p>The argument that the opposition should negotiate with the regime about reform was never popular, given the regime's rejection of compromise and its record of detaining critics. Dialogue now seems an even more remote option.</p> <p>Conversation centres on the tactics of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), or at least of those bands of young men who fight the government under its banner without co-ordination from any centre. Are they right to come into city districts and attack police and army buildings, knowing that retaliation will be massive, bloody and brutal? The army is to blame for destroying people's homes, but had the FSA not provoked it the homes might still be there and people might be alive.</p> <p>Khaled, a young man who lives with his parents in Old Mezzeh, showed me around in February. His district used to consist of fields of cactus plants surrounding cheaply built one- and two-storey breezeblock houses. Some years ago the main road to Beirut was driven through this poor rural area, uprooting people. Then came other wide avenues that now serve the Canadian and Iranian embassies as well as high-rise flats, many of whose middle-class tenants are government employees and supporters.</p> <p>The government mounted an offensive on Old Mezzeh last month. The army has since piled mounds of earth to block access except through two entrance roads behind the flats where troops check IDs. Other troops mount patrols inside the district. Sitting in a parked car outside the area this week, Khaled said the trouble began when a rumour spread that the <em>shabiha</em> (ghosts), the pro-government militias, were about to raid Old Mezzeh and slaughter people. \"Women and children left immediately and only men stayed. I was at home with my father. We asked the FSA to come and protect us. When they arrived, some were local people whom I knew, others were outsiders. People gave them food but they didn't sleep in our houses. For five or six days they were there but when word came of a government offensive they withdrew so as not to have ordinary people get hurt,\" he said.</p> <p>After the FSA retreated, the security forces moved in. According to Khaled, they looted and burned shops, and about 30 young men were killed. Burials were held in groups of three at night. Older men were detained.</p> <p>Khaled and his father had left before the army incursion. Although his fellow villagers had invited the FSA, Khaled now thinks it was a mistake since they did not have the power to resist the army. \"The tactics were not good. The FSA shouldn't come among houses since the security forces will destroy the area,\" he said.</p> <p>In Midan, another mixed district of old houses and narrow alleys leading to a settlement of better-off flats, barely two miles from central Damascus, it was the FSA that took the offensive in mid-July, according to residents. Gunmen moved in surreptitiously and attacked police stations. The army responded by sending in tanks, whose treadmarks are still visible on the soft asphalt.</p> <p>Residents showed me the al-Majed mosque, where a shell had taken a large bite out of the minaret. Several houses on street corners with good strategic views down the alleys had been damaged by heavy weapons. Bullet holes pockmarked metal shutters on shops, and I saw at least two cars that had been crushed by manoeuvring tanks. Anti-government graffiti had been painted over by troops.</p> <p>Now, two weeks after the government counterattack, a few shopkeepers had reopened for business or were repairing their ruined premises, but many residents were still sheltering elsewhere. \"It was foolish to try to attack, and it's caused heavy human loss,\" said Abdelaziz Alkhayer, a veteran member of the opposition who was released in 2005 after 14 years in prison.</p> <p>\"It was spontaneous, not well-organised, and they ran out of ammunition quickly. Some people who took part now feel deceived. We don't ask the FSA to put down their guns, otherwise they would be slaughtered. But they should not use them for offensives in city streets unless they can hold the ground.\"</p> <p>Louai Hussein, another critic of the regime, who heads Building the Syrian State, a non-governmental organisation, said criticism of FSA tactics was growing. \"Support for the FSA in these attacks depends on whether the insurgents are local or from the outside,\" he said.</p> <p>Both men are longtime critics of the opposition's militarisation. Under the auspices of the Community of Sant'Egidio in Rome, a Catholic peace-building organisation with long international experience, they joined several other Syrian opposition groups last month in signing a declaration urging the FSA to abandon violence. \"While recognising the right of citizens to legitimate defence, we repeat: weapons are not the solution,\" it said. \"We must reject violence and the slide into civil war because that places at risk the state, and our national identity and sovereignty.\"</p> <p>One person who took a sensational step in warning Syrians against self-destruction was Rima Dali, who became a political celebrity overnight in April when she staged a protest outside parliament holding a banner saying \"stop the killing\". Sarah Abu Assali, a local journalist, said she admired Dali's stand. \"Within the areas of Damascus that have been affected by violence, I think the majority have turned against the FSA, but elsewhere more are moving towards it,\" she said. \"I see an ongoing street war for at least a year \u2013 this is the best-case scenario.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394957009\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345475059677/Rima-Dali-010.jpg\" alt=\"Rima Dali\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protester Rima Dali with her banner that reads: 'Stop the killing, we want to build a country for all Syrians.'

The outside powers just want to watch us fight each other,\" she said.</p> <p>In spite of recent high-level defections and the deaths of four senior security figures in a bombing last month, the regime's core appears solid. The army has recaptured lost ground in the city's inner districts and is trying to regain control of the eastern outskirts, in an area known as the Orchards, wearing down resistance by cutting off water and electricity, blocking access and inflicting heavy shelling and mass arrests.</p> <p>In the old city of Damascus, residents report that guns are being distributed, presumably by the government, to Christians and Shias, two minorities that are particularly alarmed by the rise of militant Sunnism and the arrival of elements from al-Qaida.</p> <p>Some government members accept they will never pacify the whole of Syria. \"The government can hit the insurgents hugely and it can stop them existing in Aleppo but it can't stop them being in villages while the border is open. Military power has limits,\" said Kadri Jamil, a deputy prime minister.</p> <p>The humanitarian crisis is immense. Hundreds of Syrians have left for Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (Sarc) is distributing 175,000 food parcels within Syria. Close to a million people have been displaced countrywide.</p> <p>In Damascus the numbers fluctuate as some people go home after a few days while others flee. Sixty schools are being used as temporary shelters, and the government has not yet responded to Sarc's question about what will happen in mid-September when children are due to resume classes.</p> <p>To receive Sarc's aid, people have to be registered. Some fear this could lead to interrogation or arrest. In response, opposition supporters have set up independent shelters. Those who reject further militarisation are increasingly turning to humanitarian work as a way of taking non-violent action. They see it as a valuable form of political resistance.</p> <p>In a disused health clinic and a nearby private nursery in Barzeh I found homeless families with terrible stories of bombing and killing. Food, clothing and sleeping mats are supplied by neighbours or funded through donations, bypassing Sarc.</p> <p>\"The country is almost destroyed. We have no idea what's going to happen,\" said Abu Mohammed, the father of three who was bombed out of Homs and bombed again in Damascus. \"I never thought this could happen in Syria.\"</p> <h2><strong>Personal statement</strong></h2> <p>Rima Dali used to work for the United Nations refugee agency in Damascus, helping the thousands of homeless Iraqis who had fled to Syria. \"I saw what civil war means and what being a refugee involves,\" she said.</p> <p>The 33-year-old law graduate from Aleppo University felt depressed about Syria's criris and decided to act. \"I didn't discuss my plan with friends because they would try to dissuade me. I just told them something important would happen outside parliament. About 50 turned up with cameras,\" she said.</p> <p>There, on 8 April, she stood in the street in a red dress and poured white paint on herself. She held aloft a banner, saying: \"Stop the Killing. We want to build a homeland for all Syrians.\" Within 10 minutes police arrested her and took her to a women's prison where she stayed for four days. \"It didn't start as a campaign. It was a personal reaction. I was angry that nonviolent activity was losing its space. The government wanted to push people into violence because that's their game and they don't know how to deal with nonviolence,\" she said.</p> <p>Dali is not sure how to take the protest further, though she has a team discussing ideas with sympathisers. One idea is to form a group of bereaved mothers of troops and rebels, to be called Mothers of Martyrs. \"I'm not against the Free Syrian Army but I hope to make their role different. If you want to argue with them, you have to demonstrate an alternative, like supporting humanitarian relief and medical aid. We must talk about the ethics of the revolution and its mistakes,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The Olympic feelgood factor hasn't quite faded and some people are trying to preserve it with a new demand: honour for athletes. Surely, the argument runs, Team GB's unprecedented success in the 2012 games deserves to be recognised in the New Year's honours list? Lord Moynihan, outgoing head of the British Olympic Association, has led the calls with a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/9485854/No-automatic-gongs-for-Olympians-says-top-civil-servant.html\" title=\"\">suggestion that every single gold medallist deserves \"recognition\"</a>.</p> <p>I've lost count of the number of times I've heard demands for knighthoods for top athletes: breathless sports commentators are already pressing politicians to create \"Sir\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins?\" title=\"\">Bradley Wiggins</a> and \"Sir\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/mo-farah\" title=\"\">Mo Farah</a>. Indeed Jonathan Stephens, a civil servant at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, seems to have caused annoyance and disbelief in equal measure when he tried to dampen public expectations by saying that not all 43 medal winners would get \"automatic gongs\".</p> <p>It is bad luck for the athletes in question that their sporting success has come at a moment when there's been another, if very limited, review of the honours system. The government seems keen to update it, moving away from a model in which senior civil servants automatically expect knighthoods and damehoods to one where awards are based on \"excellence and selfless voluntary service\". Weirdly, David Cameron has also chosen this year to re-introduce the British Empire medal, a \"reform\" that goes in precisely the opposite direction of what's actually needed.</p> <p>One of the reasons I turned down an MBE is 2003 is that I didn't want to accept an award that makes reference to so many institutions \u2013 God, the monarch and the British empire \u2013 I'm not keen on. (\"For God and the empire\" is its motto and you receive it from a member of the royal family.) It's a reflection of an honours system that is both hopelessly out of date and deeply confused, as the current row about Britain's Olympic athletes demonstrates. Among many incongruities is the notion of awarding the pompous title of \"Sir\" to someone like Wiggins, who seems refreshingly unaffected by his stellar fame and success.</p> <p>The British athletes who won medals certainly fall into the government's preferred category of \"excellence\", although they're far from selfless. No one trains as hard as a professional athlete, and for so long, for altruistic reasons. There's nothing wrong with that kind of single-mindedness \u2013 or with the sponsorship deals that follow sporting success \u2013 but over-valuing it risks losing sights of other kinds of achievement. Team GB's medal winners have already been rewarded \u2013 that's what medals are for \u2013 and enjoy massive public acclaim.</p> <p>It could be argued that someone from a poor background, who trained for years and missed a medal because they happened to have an off day, is as worthy of recognition from the state as someone who's got a gold. Success isn't everything and endless demands for honours for athletes (or TV presenters such as Bruce Forsyth) are symptomatic of a culture of excess, where individual ambition is over-rewarded. That's an endemic problem with the current honours system, which hands out the same rewards to pop stars, athletes, retired politicians and people who've done voluntary work. Not long after I was offered an honour for services to human rights, I was bemused to see one of my favourite shoe designers accept a similar gong for services, presumably, to footwear.</p> <p>I've nothing against an honours system which allows the state, on behalf of the public, to thank people who've made a difference. But I'm uneasy about a kind of inflation that continually lowers the bar, throwing honours around in a way that seems more appropriate to a popularity contest. There should be room in an honours system to recognise personal success, but it should mainly be an expression of the country's values. Let's celebrate altruism, courage in the face of adversity, service to the community \u2013 and leave gold medals for athletes.</p>",
  "<p>The chief executive of the Mongolian stock exchange sits in a beige office behind an old PC, his BlackBerry ringing incessantly. Although Altai Khangai is only 31, his hair shows traces of gray; he wears a pink-striped shirt and designer glasses. \"I think the exchange will bring a fundamental change to Mongolia,\" he says in between sips of coffee. \"It will transform Mongolia.\"</p> <p>Located in a former children's cinema on Sukhbator Square in the centre of Ulan Bator, the Mongolian stock exchange (MSE) was opened in 1993 as a way to privatise government-owned assets after almost 70 years of Soviet rule. It originally had 30 brokers and was open for two hours a week.</p> <p>Times have changed. The MSE recently completed a three-year, $14m (\u00a38.9m) partnership with the London Stock Exchange, and installed a top-of-the-line brokering software system called Millennium IT, considered the best in the world.</p> <p>It was the world's top performing stock exchange in 2010; last year it was number two, after Venezuela. \"Some strange things take place in Mongolia, but things are improving and we're progressing,\" Altai said.</p> <p>Driving progress at the MSE is the recent discovery of vast mineral deposits in the Mongolian hinterlands, some of which found their way into the medals awarded at the Olympic Games in London. Last year, Mongolia's economy grew by 17.3%, the fastest rate in Asia and almost double that of China, one \u2013 with Russia \u2013 of its two vast immediate neighbours.</p> <p>If you were going to develop a commodity supply source anywhere \u2013 even today, when global commodity prices have taken a dip \u2013 it would be in this former Soviet satellite right next to China, the most resource-hungry market in the world.</p> <p>The boom in Mine-golia, as some are now dubbing it, has arrived courtesy of a wave of investment from foreign firms wanting to get their hands on copper, coal and rare earth minerals.</p> <p>The US group Nova Mining Corporation recently said it planned to build a railway line from Mongolia to the Chinese coast as a way to ship supplies of lithium needed to meet demand from Apple for new iPhones. Lithium is a key ingredient in long-life batteries for phones and electric cars and Nova is close to an exclusive deal to tie up supplies from the Mongolian National Mining consultants.</p> <p>Other mining projects include the Tavan Tolgoi opencast coal facility in the southern Gobi region. Tavan Tolgoi has estimated reserves of as much as 7.5bn tonnes of coal, including the world's largest untapped deposit of coking coal, which is used to make steel. Output from Tavan and elsewhere is expected to grow from a current level of about 16m tonnes a year to as much as 240m by 2040, according to some estimates.</p> <p>Also coming online is the Oyu Tolgoi, a vast source of copper and gold in the southern Gobi that sits just 50 miles north of the Chinese border. The mine is ultimately controlled by the London-based mining group Rio Tinto, and is expected to start production in the next few months after $6bn of investment \u2013 the largest single investment in Mongolian history.</p> <h2>Problematic Chinese relationship</h2> <p>\"Economists estimate that the Mongolian economy will be more than a third larger in 2019 because of Oyu Tolgoi (OT),\" said a spokesman at Rio's London head office. \"Beyond the mine itself, OT is driving the biggest revolution in infrastructure building ever in the South Gobi, constructing roads, an airport, and power lines that will supply local towns with 24-hour electricity for the first time. We are sponsoring the largest vocational training programme in Mongolia's history, educating 3,300 of Mongolia's future workforce in professions as diverse as accountancy, IT and environmental management.\"</p> <p>But all this foreign involvement and a growing relationship with China is not without its problems. Nor is the domestic political situation entirely stable, with the former prime minister having been jailed for four years last month for corruption and a new leader, Norov Altankhuyag, from the Democratic party, confirmed in office only nine days ago.</p> <p>The current government is opposing a near-$1bn bid from Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) for SouthGobi Resources, a business with coalmining interests in Mongolia.</p> <p>Last week Alex Molyneux, the chief executive of SouthGobi, said the government had made the deal \"impossible\" and he believed the Chinese had dropped their interest, although they have until 4 September to formalise their bid.</p> <p>An expected stock market flotation by Tavan Tolgoi, expected for both the Mongolian and London stock exchanges, was recently put back from this year to early 2013 for reasons many attribute to political interference.</p> <p>The path of progress has never been a straight line at the local exchange. In the early 1990s, the MSE gave each Mongolian citizen a small packet of pink and blue coupons, which they could use to bid for shares in hitherto state-owned companies. Most Mongolians did not understand the value of equity, however, and a small handful of the urban elite snapped up the coupons for a pittance.</p> <p>And many of the MSE's current members are a fossilized reminder of its early failures. Only 40 of the 350 companies listed on the exchange are actively trading; daily trading volume rarely exceeds $150,000. The exchange has delivered 17 IPOs in its history.</p> <p>\"The MSE basically lost its credibility a long time ago, which is why it needs to redefine itself,\" said Nagi Otgonshar, a vice president at Resource Investment Capital, a financial advisory firm in Ulan Bator.</p> <p>The exchange's's American-educated chief regulatory officer, Saruul Ganbaatar, said that the MSE has drafted a new securities law which will make it easier for Mongolian companies to list on the exchange \u2013 and for foreigners to invest in them.</p> <p>Ganbaatar accepts that Mongolian politicians and broking houses have been struggling to learn the ropes of modern capital markets. \"When I started last year there were 46 brokerages and now there are over 80,\" he said. \"This brings in a risk that some are not so competent, or not trained as well.\"</p> <p>Outside the room, optimism is certainly still high; some analysts say that the combined wealth from the country's 10 biggest mines, if evenly distributed, could make every Mongolian citizen a millionaire.</p> <p>Ulan Bator has begun to acquire the trappings of a boomtown. Across from the MSE is a gleaming 25-story office tower with Louis Vuitton and Armani outlets on the lower floors. Beyond, a sprawl of ramshackle Soviet apartment buildings and traditional felt-lined tents stretches into the distance.</p>",
  "<p>Children in a refugee camp in South Sudan are dying at more than twice the rate internationally recognised as an emergency, according to new figures released by M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).</p> <p>On an average day in the Yusuf Batil camp, a hastily constructed expanse of tents among thick trees in a flood plain in Maban county in the north of South Sudan, three or four children under the age of five will die. In a \"normal\" emergency situation, the number would be one or two deaths daily for every 10,000 children.</p> <p>The overall mortality rate, which takes into account adults and older children, is also substantially above the emergency threshold, according to a survey conducted at the camp last month by MSF. About 58% of the camp's reported deaths have been children under five, while more than 25% have been people over 50.</p> <p>Yusuf Batil is one of four refugee camps in Maban county, home to more than 100,000 people fleeing fighting in Blue Nile State, just over the border in Sudan. It was set up to relieve pressure on Jamam camp, 52km away, <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=6106&amp;cat=press-release\" title=\"\">which flooded in June</a>. Mortality rates are now believed to be highest in Yusuf Batil, in part because the people living there often left it until the last moment to leave Sudan, when they were already weak.</p> <p>UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, reported last month that Yusuf Batil <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/500e7cc39.html\" title=\"\">was already close to reaching its capacity</a> of 34,500 people, adding that water supplies, hygiene and sanitation needed to be increased. During the rainy season, which is currently in full flow, the clay soil retains water, creating heavy black mud and pools of water. The stagnant water increases the risk of diseases.</p> <p>MSF said the major cause of death was \"overwhelmingly diarrhoea\", which caused more than 90% of deaths, although malnutrition was likely to have been a contributory factor in many of those deaths.</p> <p>\"These people had to undergo the most horrendous of journeys, and it got worse not better at every step,\" said Helen Ottens-Patterson, MSF's medical co-ordinator in South Sudan. After walking for so long with little food \u2013 many survived on leaves \u2013 the refugees were often malnourished when they arrived at the camp , increasing their vulnerability to disease.</p> <p>Many areas in the camps have been organised along the lines of the villages the refugees left behind: several are now marked by a neat row of dirt graves, covered by branches to protect them. \"The refugees are at the end of their reserves, particularly the under-fives and the elderly \u2013 that's where we see the highest mortality, in those two vulnerable groups,\" Ottens-Patterson said.</p> <p>Hassan Afeeda, a young man dressed in a Manchester United shirt, was one of those who fled the fighting, travelling through the night to conserve energy. \"When the fighting started, they bombed us, and then shelled us from a long way away,\" he said. \"We walked for a long time, carrying our young children. Even when we got near the border they were bombing us.\"</p> <p>Some people said they had lost relatives in air raids, others claimed they were tortured by Sudanese soldiers. Most of the refugees in Yusuf Batil are from the Ingessana, the same ethnic group as Malik Agar, the rebel leader fighting the Sudanese government in Blue Nile. The Sudanese armed forces deny targeting civilians, but they have been criticised by human rights groups and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVoc-SqQeEc\" title=\"\">the UN</a> for aerial bombardments.</p> <p>Nil's pregnant wife died in childbirth on the long trek from their home. He is looking after his eight children with some help from his mother-in-law, who is herself frail. All the children have eye infections, and several are malnourished, but Mohamed is the worst. When he stands up, holding on to the tent, his legs are curved like bows. Mohamed has lost so much weight his limbs and bottom seem to have no flesh under the skin, but his belly sticks out from his body, the clear sign of malnourishment.</p> <p>Mohamed and the others in the camp need far more help than they are getting. This is one of the most remote places in South Sudan, and the country is one of the least developed in the world. Before South Sudan's independence, <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/\" title=\"\">Sudan ranked 169 out of 187 countries</a> on the UN's human development index.</p> <p>The rainy season makes it impossible to bring food and other much-needed supplies in by road. \"It's like being on an island,\" says Frederic Cussigh, the local head of UNHCR. He says the crisis is so severe the agency has had to carry out tasks it doesn't usually do, such as improving a road between camps, and hiring customs officials to help charter planes to bring supplies in.</p> <p>The cost of operating in this kind of environment is extremely high. But MSF says the operation in Yusuf Batil needs to be scaled up quickly, or things will get worse. \"The next stage is just about as bad as it gets \u2013 everyone dying,\" says Ottens-Patterson. \"It's that close. We're at a crucial tipping point.\"</p>",

Gu's father, Gu Jingsheng, was a general who took charge of missile research but was ousted in the 1950s anti-rightist movement because Fan was judged politically unreliable. Though urged to divorce by comrades, he stood by her.</p> <p>\"It affected his political career for several decades. He never regretted it or complained,\" Fan later wrote. \"He was a man out of the ordinary.\"</p> <p>In 1966, when Gu was just seven, the lives of the five daughters took another turn for the worse as the Cultural Revolution broke out. Their father was jailed for 12 years; not long afterwards their mother, too, was detained.</p> <p>Gu Jingsheng had already foreseen what was likely to happen, warning his children that their parents might have to go away.</p> <p>\"Don't think too much just because I and your mother suffer criticism every day and they come to home to search frequently,\" he urged them in a letter. \"Don't be threatened by the door-knocking and confiscations during the night, and don't be misled by the neighbourhood children [if they accuse us].\"</p> <p>While her elder sisters did their best to protect Gu, the family struggled to survive. She worked as a labourer, in a textile factory and as a butcher's assistant. Even then, she did everything well, it seemed; years later, she could still cut meat cleanly with a single cleaver stroke.</p> <p>The end of the turmoil and her parents' rehabilitation cleared the way for Gu to go to the prestigious Peking University, where she studied law and international relations. She met Bo on a university research trip, she told a magazine. He was party secretary of the area she visited and \"very much like my father, that sort of extremely idealistic person\".</p> <p>The background to their meeting was more complicated than that wide-eyed account suggested. Their fathers had long known each other, first meeting in the 1930s; her sister's husband was the brother of Bo's first wife.</p> <p>That marriage ended acrimoniously in the early 80s and Gu married Bo in 1986. He treated his young bride \"like a queen\", said a friend, and their son Guagua was born the following year.</p> <p>Soon after, Gu set up her own law firm, Kailai, and took the professional name Horus L Kai. Though it evoked the falcon deity, it was taken, more prosaically, from the title of Egyptair's inflight magazine, glimpsed on a business trip.</p> <p>For a while, the couple's careers appeared to be on the fast track. Bo became mayor of the north-eastern city of Dalian, and earned a reputation as a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/22/red-songs-chinese-cultural-revolution\" title=\"\">popular leader with an eye for attention-grabbing initiatives</a>.</p> <p>Gu proved equally canny, writing a book about her battle to overturn a US court judgment against Dalian-based firms. It lauded the support she had received from \"the big man in the family\".</p> <p>She said she took on the case at the request of Dalian officials and there were other signs of crossover with her husband's work. In 1996, she represented the Port of Singapore in a $1.5bn joint venture deal with the Port of Dalian.</p> <p>Her family was prospering too, with her elder sisters establishing <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-13/china-murder-suspect-s-sisters-ran-126-million-business-empire.html\" title=\"\">a web of businesses that Bloomberg reported this year was worth $126m (\u00a380m)</a>.</p> <p>As Bo climbed the political ladder, friends wondered if his wife's business activities could become a hindrance. Her law firm, now based in Beijing, changed its name to Angdao. Even so, Gu remained registered with the firm and acquaintances believe her involvement continued for some time. Angdao has refused to comment.</p> <p>In his final public appearance this year, Bo said he was \"touched\" by his wife's sacrifice in becoming a housewife for his sake.</p> <p>Others thought Gu learned to revel in her status as Bo's wife. \"She enjoyed people asking for favours and being treated like a star,\" says one of those who knew her.</p> <p>But the couple were leading increasingly separate lives. One friend said Gu was distraught when Bo became conspicuously enchanted by another woman in the early 1990s, confiding that she had contemplated divorce and suicide. As time went on, she spent increasingly lengthy periods with her parents in Beijing or overseas.</p> <p>Ever since the announcement of her detention on suspicion of murdering Neil Heywood, officials have referred to her as \"Bogu Kailai\", in what some have seen as a hint she had obtained foreign residency or even a foreign passport. While mainland women rarely combine their names with their husbands, it is common in Singapore. An official said Gu had obtained Singaporean nationality or residency. Chinese law does not allow dual nationality.</p> <p>For much of the time she appears to have been in the UK, where Guagua was studying. At one stage she lived in Bournemouth, where she and Patrick Devillers, a French architect who was also part of her inner circle, gave the same address when they registered as directors of a company.</p> <p>Many of the people who encountered her there recall her as kind, polite and friendly. Giles Hall, a businessman who dealt with her, was struck by her charm when she approached him with an unusual request to export a hot air balloon to Dalian.</p> <p>But Hall saw another side to her when he angered her by refusing to bulk up the invoice so she could bring another \u00a3200,000 into the country to pay her son's school fees. When the firm did not meet what he called an overly ambitious deadline for delivery, she warned him that if he came to China \"we can get you thrown in jail. You'll never see the light of day,\" he told Associated Press.</p> <p>Heywood told friends Gu worried about betrayal, believed people were out to get her and was \"mentally unstable\".</p> <p>One account of her trial said the court heard she had bipolar disorder and moderate schizophrenia, while Xinhua said she had been treated for \"insomnia, anxiety and depression, and paranoia\" in the past.</p> <p>Certainly, she told friends she was considering treatment for depression. She seems to have led an increasingly solitary life and Bo Guagua described her as living \"like a hermit\" in an interview in 2009.</p> <p>He suggested she turned down social invitations because she did not want to be in his father's shadow.</p> <p>Three years on, Gu has overshadowed Bo and determined his political fate; not through her achievements, but her crime.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, somehow, football finds a way. The opening night of the new season was one of those times. They can sell your best players, asset-strip your dreams, cut the cable on the back of your TV, and destroy your chances of winning anything ever again. They can try to empty stadiums of fans and fill newspapers with water. They can make you play when its so hot you faint or so late your star striker says he should be in bed. And actually mean sleeping. You can wake a few hours later, wearily facing the week ahead, and realise that there are three matches left, one of which is the \"general interest\" match which doesn't interest you at all. Then it dawns on you that this week's round of games is kind of over but won't actually be over until Monday night.</p> <p>Or, in fact, Tuesday morning.</p> <p>You can imagine them sitting round a big table, Muttley sniggering below, as they ask the question: \"right then, gentlemen, any more brilliant suggestions as to how we screw the league this time?\" You can do all that, and so can they, but still they won't entirely succeed. Sometimes, somehow, football finds a way. Not for very long \u2013 reality has a nasty habit of getting in the way \u2013 but for one brief, ecstatic, melting moment.</p> <p>It would not be the start of the Spanish season if there wasn't a risk of the Spanish season not starting. And, four days after the threat of a walk-out by 13 clubs was averted, two days after a <em>provisional</em> agreement was reached about who would be showing it, La Liga finally got underway.</p> <p>When it did, everything had changed except <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/aug/15/barcelona-real-madrid-spanish-football\" title=\"\">what really needed to be changed.</a> There were nine different kick-off times and yet they still managed to put the two most attractive games on at the same time: Athletic Bilbao v Betis and Real Madrid v Valencia. The free-to-air game, protected by law as \"general interest\" had shifted to Monday night, a slot that will never be occupied by Madrid or Barcelona, and one that is filled tonight by Zaragoza and Valladolid. The new grid, for August at least, ran: 7pm, 9pm and 11pm on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. \"At 11pm, I'm asleep,\" insisted Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's Radamel Falcao. It was ticking towards 1am Monday morning when the final whistle went on his side's 1-1 draw at Levante.</p> <p>It is a mess, but it is back. And, amid the gloom, there was sunshine too. Something to enjoy. Hope. A little fun. Football. Proper people. Mallorca's Tomer Hemed scored two lovely goals \u2013 one on Saturday at 11.06pm and one on Sunday at 00.52am, which will make a nice quiz question one day \u2013 as they defeated Espanyol 2-1. Son Moix was empty, although curiously less empty than on the opening day last season when they kicked off at 6pm against the same opponents. David Villa returned from his broken leg and scored in his first game since Christmas in Barcelona's 5-1 win over Real Sociedad. He wore T-shirt underneath with a picture of his wife and kids that said: \"impossible without you.\"</p> <p>In Seville, there was a 2-1 win over Getafe and the comfort that some things never change and never stop. Some things called Jes\u00fas Navas.</p> <p>Meanwhile Valencia, selling their best player yet again, got a 1-1 draw against Real Madrid and might even have got a winner, only for Roberto Soldado's goal to be ruled out for an offside that replays didn't catch conclusively; a moment's <em>ilusi\u00f3n</em> for them and for everyone that maybe the \"other\" teams can compete after all. \"The Bernab\u00e9u was an oven. [League vice-president Javier] Tebas's eeny-meeny-miny-mo put Madrid at 7pm, envious of Barcelona's luck at playing in a tepid, Mediterranean 29C at 9pm.\" wrote AS's editor, opening a new season of conspiratorial columns as he means to go on. Because, of course, Valencia have no problems in the heat and it's not as if next week, when it will still be August, the kick-off times are inverted.</p> <p>Up in Bilbao there was a far better game going on, blessed with a handful of wonderful goals. Athletic were without Fernando Llorente and Javi Mart\u00ednez, both likely to leave. Graffiti appeared on the window of the club shop, wishing death upon Llorente the \"bastard Spaniard\" whose nationality wasn't a problem before he announced his intention to leave a week ago. They went 3-0 down to Betis. The man who led them: Be\u00f1at Exteberr\u00eda, a former Athletic youth teamer and just about the only available Basque player good enough to be worth signing in replacement for Mart\u00ednez. Athletic then pulled it back to 3-3 with 15 minutes left, led by a wonderful first scored by \u00d3scar de Marcos, only for Betis to win 5-3.</p> <p>It was mad and it was marvellous; it was also unnoticed; they were watching Real. But the football was fighting back. And nowhere more than in the opening game of the new season. Celta Vigo were back in the first division after five years away. Their opponents were M\u00e1laga. And no teams' fans have had the summer M\u00e1laga's have. In midweek, thousands of them queued overnight for tickets for their first-ever Champions League campaign. But instead of joy, it looked worryingly like a campaign tinged with a little regret. Last summer, they spent almost \u20ac60m on players; this summer, they have spent none. Instead, they have sold almost \u20ac50m-worth for less than \u20ac30m, the dream silently deconstructed.</p> <p>The Qatari owner Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser al-Thani had disappeared; no more money, no more investment, and not a word. His interest, gone. Something was not right; in football terms, at least, it just didn't make sense. You spend millions on building a team to reach the Champions League and when you do, you throw in the towel. Maybe that was the point: maybe, it was never about the game. Maybe it was all an illusion, a sleight of hand. Good while it lasted but quickly gone. Players denounced the club for not paying wages. Villarreal, Osasuna and River Plate too complained that they were owed money. So did the Spanish taxman. And, since the spring, the state had finally turned tough.</p> <p>Still, there was silence. Institutional director Fernando Hierro had walked, unhappy with what he was seeing. There was a power vacuum, inertia. And when at last there was movement, it wasn't what they hoped for. Al-Thani's representative Moayad Shatat turned up, M\u00e1laga's very own Mr Wolf. But rather than slapping down the cash and shutting mouths, they did the opposite. First they tried to sell the club; then, with the clock ticking, the asset stripping began. Santi Cazorla left for a fee so ridiculously low that even the manager had forewarned that it would amount to \"giving him away\", so did Joris Mathijsen, and Solomon Rond\u00f3n.</p> <p>With Ruud van Nistelrooy's retirement, that meant that all those who had made formal complaints (and then, on assurances about their future, withdrew them) were gone. They may still not be the only ones. The sporting director was offered a severance package and there were even discussions with the manager, Manuel Pellegrini, about rescinding his contract or taking a pay cut. J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan's agent admitted that he might leave too. On top of that, Julio Baptista is <em>still</em> not fit. All those players: gone. All that hope too.</p> <p>And so it was that on Saturday night, with the score at 0-0 and just before the hour, Pellegrini sent on Fabrice Olinga. A 16-year-old Cameroonian kid who arrived in Mallorca aged 12 thanks to the Samuel Eto'o Foundation and joined M\u00e1laga last season; a timid-looking kid who lives in a small room at the club's youth team residency and who had not even played a minute in M\u00e1laga's B team down in <em>tercera</em> - not so much Spain's third division as it's 20th. A kid who insists: \"mistakes chase me, but I am faster than them.\"</p> <p>Within a few minutes, he had fluffed an easy chance. Then, with six minutes to go, it happened: he stepped past the defender and curled is shot against the post. Diego Buonanotte collected the rebound, cut back inside and crossed. The debutant reached it and kneed the ball over the line. He disappeared into his team-mates' arms, a look of delighted incredulity on his face. All the pessimism, the cynicism, the clouds: gone. And in that instant, at 16 years and 93 days, Fabrice Olinga became the youngest goalscorer ever in La Liga. Football found a way.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Celta 0-1 M\u00e1laga, Sevilla 2 - 1 Getafe, Mallorca 2-1 Espanyol, Madrid 1-1 Valencia, Athletic 3-5 Betis, Barcelona 5-1 Real Sociedad, Levante 1-1 Atl\u00e9tico. <strong>Tonight:</strong> Deportivo-Osasuna, Rayo-Granada, Zaragoza-Valladolid.</p>",
  "<h2>You shouldn't always play to the whistle...</h2> <p>Afterwards Thierry Henry sat just inside the door of the New York locker room with a towel over his head, staring fixedly into space. Anyone passing in and out of the room had to pass by this glowering vigil - and it made for one of the most muted winning locker rooms I've ever been in. Never mind that <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-19-ny-v-por/highlights\">the Red Bulls had come from 2-0 down to win</a>, for the first time since since 2004 - Henry and the rest of the Red Bulls knew they'd got lucky, not least with a referee who appeared not to play to his own whistle.</p> <p>With the Timbers having raced into a two goal lead off some great counter-attacking, and generally tormenting a woeful New York back line on the break in the first half hour, Hans Backe had hauled Miller off for Cooper and reorganized the whole side round the switch. Never known for his early substitutions (Backe joked grimly later that it was his first such early change in twenty years), the coach's hand had been forced by a series of turnovers, positional errors and obvious fatigue from Lindpere and Miller, both returning from international duty to be repeatedly bypassed on the left.</p> <p>With under five minutes to go till half time the switch paid off, as Cooper headed home Solli's cross, and then two minutes later came the most controversial moment of the game, as a McCarty shot was charged down by what looked like a handball in the box. Cahill pounced on the rebound, just as the referee Jason Anno appeared to blow for the infringement and run towards the spot. With players from both teams looking confused, the referee turned upfield for the center circle, pursued by irate Portland players, who'd stopped play assuming the kick had been given and now realized that Cahill's shot had leveled the scores. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1120816/mls_2012-08-19-195816.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"cfb1fc2oi\" name=\"cfb1fc2on\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1120816/mls_2012-08-19-195816.640hq.mp4\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1120816/mls_2012-08-19-195816.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cfb1fc2ei\" name=\"cfb1fc2en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>.</p> <p>It wasn't Cahill's last moment of controversy - the MLS disciplinary committee may want to decide if the arm he caught Kimura with in the second half (ending the full back's evening) was flailing or just trailing. Other than his goal, it was a difficult night for Cahill, who's still seeking match fitness and who labored on a heavy pitch. To compensate he'd often drop deep, forcing midfield partner McCarty forward, in an inversion of both players' best qualities.</p> <p>Despite the unexpected boost the Red Bulls had gained with the equalizer, they struggled to put the Timbers away in the second half. On several occasions only poor Portland finishing and inspired Gaudette keeping kept the scores level, and even after Pearce had headed an 82nd minute winner for New York, there was still time for Wallace to waste a free header to tie up the game. </p> <p>Frustrating for Gavin Wilkinson, whose side carved open the New York defense repeatedly, without managing to score again, though there was at least as much frustration on the Red Bull bench at this sloppy display. Normally a 3-2 win would then have players talking about character and digging deep, but to a man, the New York players seemed embarrassed by their performance afterwards - presumably taking their cue from their captain seething in the corner. Henry knows the same performance at Livestrong Park next week would see Sporting (<a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-18-tor-v-skc/highlights\">victors over Toronto this weekend</a>) go five points clear at the top of the East, and despite declining to speak to the press, his message to us, and his team mates, was loud and clear: <em>Not good enough</em>. <strong>GP</strong></p> <h2>Ben Olsen not a fan of ref Mark Geiger after crazy end to I-95 game</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-19-dc-v-phi/highlights\">All hell broke loose in the last five minutes at RFK Stadium on Sunday afternoon</a>, as rivals DC United and the Philadelphia Union battled out a 1-1 tie in an utterly bizarre set of circumstances.<br>&#xa0;<br>The play was scrappy throughout, as both goals attested. First the Union's Brian Carroll scrambled home the ball after a game of pinball in the DC box, to give Philadelphia an early lead. Then DC equalized when Branko Boskovic's free kick flicked off Union defender Amobi Okugo and into the net.<br>&#xa0;<br>But before that Nick DeLeon looked to have a perfectly good goal chalked off by referee Mark Geiger. He blew for a foul on Zac MacMath after the ball fell to DeLeon who hammered home. But replays show Union defender Gabriel Farfan kicked MacMath and the ball, as that clearance fell to DeLeon who finished.<br>&#xa0;<br>Geiger was officiating his first match since returning from the Olympics and took center stage. DC head coach Ben Olsen wished he hadn't. The last five minutes of this match exploded into life with laughable decisions, three red cards, disallowed penalties, missed penalties and teammates fighting. Fans of both teams stood watching in disbelief as the action on field seem to implode further with every minute ticking away.<br>&#xa0;<br>First, a penalty was given to DC, which Dwayne DeRosario scored. But Geiger whistled for encroachment, on first viewing it looked like Philadelphia players were the only ones in the box. But indeed DC's Hamdi Salihi encroached into the 'D' before the kick was taken. Either way it was harsh from Geiger, who then sent off Boskovic for a pushing match with Roger Torres as a lengthy wait for the retake ensued. Then, to thicken the plot, DeRosario smashed his retake over the bar.<br>&#xa0;<br>Soon after Emiliano Dudar was shown a straight red for lunging in, Sheannon Williams was given a harsh second yellow after a slide tackle he looked to have made cleanly. Then as the final whistle blew, DC defenders Brandon MacDonald and Kris Korb flung themselves at each other, shouting and screaming, pushing and shoving, creating more chaos. &#xa0;<br>&#xa0;<br>All of this happened in the final 4 minutes of the 90, plus stoppage time. Incredible.<br>&#xa0;<br><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/08/19/olsen-blasts-ref-dc-draw-it-was-his-show-tonight\">Olsen was damning with these words on referee Geiger</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's the Geiger show. He wants to make the big call to change a game. It's what they do. Coming back from the Olympics, it was his show tonight. His show. Not about the players. That's what happens when referees don't have control of the game and don't have a good pulse of what's going on out there. We've got to [expletive] and moan tonight and smash some lockers and all that stuff, and then tomorrow forget about it and get ready for a very good Chicago team on Wednesday.</p> </blockquote> <p>That game against Chicago is even bigger now, with DC recording just one win in their last five. United sit four points behind Chicago in the fifth and final playoff spot in the East, but they do have a game in hand. <strong>JPW</strong></p> <h2>Montreal Impact can shake up the Eastern play off picture</h2> <p>I'll get to the Impact \u2014 the four-consecutive-game-winning-Impact in a moment. But first there's the small matter of three red cards, including one to one Lenhart, S. In last week's comments section for this feature, one of our regular commenters <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17668958\">was moved to say</a> that people needed to stop bashing the much-improved Steven Lenhart, prompting me to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17670449\">clarify my own story on his late, late winner</a> against Seattle:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He's just one of those players that opposition players must see on the team sheet and know they're in for a very particular type of long afternoon - and their anticipation of that, as much as Lenhart's own actions, probably becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as to how his involvement with the game pans out - I do think there are a fair amount of players who try to get their retaliation in first against him. Like Craig Bellamy, he attracts trouble on the field, that goes beyond the inevitable friction that should come with his particular role. It's not that he starts it, but the fact that he's there does make it more likely...</p> </blockquote> <p>So this week, this happened...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1119682/mls_2012-08-18-200922.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"cf918efoi\" name=\"cf918efon\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1119682/mls_2012-08-18-200922.640hq.mp4\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1119682/mls_2012-08-18-200922.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cf918efei\" name=\"cf918efen\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>.</p> <p>Leaving aside the issue of who started it - and the thing with Lenhart is that as I suggested, the back story to any incident tends to way precede the whistle for kick off, Lenhart's 21st minute ejection hurt his team. While Chris Wondolowski would break his mini-drought in front of goal by scoring the penalty that resulted from this incident, with Lenhart off the field the league-leading scorer was starved of the knockdowns he thrives on and <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-18-mtl-v-sj/highlights\">the Impact were good value for their 3-1 win</a>. They were further helped when Jason Hernandez saw the game's third straight red for a last-man foul that gave the Impact a penalty for the third goal, but by then Montreal were already leading and looking well set for their fourth consecutive win.</p> <p>It's been a great run for the expansion side, who by the end of Saturday night had inched ahead of DC United into the final play off spot, albeit temporarily, and crucially having played five games more. The Impact's schedule has been pretty frontloaded this year. All of the teams around them have games in hand on the Canadian side, but as our regular Impact game previewer Sofiane Benzaza pointed out in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/aug/17/mls-week-24-vancouver-whitecaps-seattle-sounders-usa-mexico\">this week's game previews</a>, a lot of those games are against each other. It's still a long shot for the Impact to make even the fifth play-off spot, but if their form continues like this they'll ensure that the other contenders have more to think about than which of those spots they themselves will finish in.</p> <p>The Impact are also just a goal shy of Portland's tally of 40 goals last year - which is the record total scored by an expansion team. They may run out of time this season, but they're finishing very strongly and look well set for next year. San Jose, as frontrunners, should finish strongly too, but next week at least, they'll have to press their own case without Lenhart and Hernandez. <strong>GP</strong></p> <h2>Squad rotation keeps Fire going</h2> <p>Chicago are on a roll. The Fire are the hottest team right now in MLS (excuse the pun) and proved their credentials for a strong postseason push once again. </p> <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/2YxHMRqoy1c\">Yet another 2-1 win</a> came their way on Saturday night, against a reeling New England side. Goals came thick and fast in a frenetic opening 25 minutes, as Chris Rolfe opened the scoring with a penalty, but the Revs' were soon level through Fernando Cardenas who scrambled home an equalizer after good play from Saer Sene down the left-wing. But Chicago's game-winner was newly signed Designated Player Sherjil MacDonald, as the Dutchman headed home his first MLS goal to seal the 2-1 win.</p> <p>But it wasn't just the three points gained that stood out for the Fire. Their sheer determination to keep piling on the pressure throughout will have impressed Frank Klopas. Yes, they will come up against better sides than New England in the run-in \u2014 and potentially in the playoffs \u2014 but if they continue to attack with pace, precision and aggression, they won't be far off winning the East. </p> <p>The win on Saturday was Chicago's third-straight and they're now four games unbeaten, climbing momentarily into second spot. And when you look at the players who didn't start the Fire's last game, it proves just how strong their current squad is. Last season's top scorer Dominic Oduro, experienced right-back Dan Gargan and cultured midfielder Marco Pappa were all left out of the staring eleven. Patrick Nyarko impressed all night long against New England, after he had previously been rested. <a href=\"http://www.chicago-fire.com/video/2012/08/18/postgame-players-recap-match-vs-new-england \">He had this to say</a> of Chicago's newfound emphasis on utilizing the whole squad: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the midfield is our strongest spot on the team, and we've got a lot of depth. Frank [Klopas, head coach] mentioned that we're going to do a rotation to keep everyone fresh. It's important to keep guys fresh. Marco [Pappa] went to the national team, he got a rest tonight. We have a game Wednesday, and we have a guy fresh. It's good, we're in a strong position.</p> </blockquote> <p>The rotation system is working seamlessly and shows how much of a threat Chicago are to Sporting, New York, Houston and DC United in the East. They play the latter on Wednesday night at RFK Stadium, in a match that will have huge implications on both sides playoff hopes. <strong>JPW</strong></p> <h2>Red hot Dallas surge towards playoffs </h2> <p>Take the top two creative attacking talents out of any MLS side and that team will struggle. Fact. So understandably, FC Dallas have been languishing towards the bottom end of the Western conference for most of the season. But now with Brek Shea and David Ferreira back in the lineup and in full-flow, Dallas look an entirely different outfit. They are rejuvenated and are resembling the 2010 side that made a run all the way to the MLS Cup final. </p> <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/kGcmV-XVeGk \">With the last-gasp win over RSL</a> at Rio Tinto on Saturday, Dallas have now won three-straight and sit just five points behind Vancouver and LA who occupy the final two playoff spots in the West. With Shea back to his best, both<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/16/mexico-usa-live\"> for the USA</a> and Dallas, the young Texan looks to propel his squad to the playoffs. Along with the help of this little fella:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1119970/mls_2012-08-18-230910.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"cf4db4foi\" name=\"cf4db4fon\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1119970/mls_2012-08-18-230910.640hq.mp4\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1119970/mls_2012-08-18-230910.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cf4db4fei\" name=\"cf4db4fen\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>.</p> <p>Playing in the hole behind the forwards, Ferreira pulled the offensive strings against Salt Lake. That resulted in a beautiful one-two with Fabian Castillo for the opener, before smashing home a laser into the top corner to seal the 2-1 win in the 94th minute. </p> <p>After being sidelined for so long through injury, the diminutive midfielder is clearly making up for lost time. Since his return to the fold on July 4, Dallas are 5-2-3. They've climbed off the bottom of the West and now have a serious chance to make the postseason. </p> <p>Head coach Schellas Hyndman spoke of Ferreira's commitment to the cause and how the 2010 MLS MVP has transformed the side: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He came to me and said, 'I'm dead, I'm absolutely dead,' And I said, 'I'll get a change for you,' and he said, 'No, I'll keep fighting, but I just want you to know I'm dead and I can't run.' We're a completely different now team with Ferreira. I think before we battled and had some good players, but we were always hoping to get a result. Now we're going in thinking we are going to get a result.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it's also worth noting that without the likes of Daniel Hernandez and Julian de Guzman doing his dirty work, Ferreira wouldn't be able to weave past defenders with his wonderful trickery. RSL battered Dallas for long periods on Saturday but the Texans held firm and keep fighting to the end, for a win they knew would set them up nicely for crucial matches ahead. A season defining stretch now beckons for FCD. In their next three games they face LA, Seattle and Vancouver, the three teams who sit directly above them in the standings. Will they catch them? The next three weeks will go quite some way to answering that.<strong> JPW</strong></p> <p><a href=\"www.mlssoccer.com/standings \">MLS STANDINGS</a></p>",
  "<p>Former England manager Steve McClaren failed in a high court bid over the weekend to prevent the Sun publishing a front-page story about an alleged extramarital affair.</p> <p>McClaren unsuccessfully applied for an 11th-hour privacy injunction to prevent the publication of the story in the Sunday edition of the Sun, headed \"Soccer exclusive: McClaren affair with Sven's ex\".</p> <p>The high court threw out McClaren's legal bid after an emergency one-hour hearing by telephone on Saturday evening.</p> <p>Mr Justice Lindblom, the high court judge considering the application, ruled that the public interest in the story being published outweighed McClaren's right to privacy.</p> <p>David Dinsmore, the interim managing editor of the Sun, described the ruling as \"an important victory in what is becoming an increasingly difficult world\".</p> <p>The story alleged that McClaren had an extramarital affair with Saima Ansari, who previously claimed to have had a relationship with his predecessor as England manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson.</p> <p>The high court ruling comes after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/superinjunctions\" title=\"\">an extraordinary period for privacy injunctions in 2011</a>, when the high court granted numerous gagging orders to sports stars and people in the entertainment industry.</p> <p>It is understood that McClaren's role as ex-England manager was a significant factor in the high court decision.

  "<p>It's interesting that, while everyone is getting ironically excited about The Expendables 2 (the irony is dead important), the announcement of a new Army of Two title has been met with much head-shaking and world-weary bemusement. EA's co-op shooter titles are cut from the same idiotic, hyper-masculine cloth as the Expendables flicks, but yet the games industry has seemingly run out of patience with guilty pleasures. I'm not sure if that's progress or not. </p> <p>Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel at first seems like a toned down version of the previous two titles. The daft, sweary mercenaries have been replaced by two anonymous troopers, Alpha and Bravo, on some covert mission against Mexican drug gangs. This is a darker world, with more at stake, yet the gameplay seems highly familiar \u2013 blast through a series of set-piece battles, using co-operative tactics as much as possible while occasionally splitting up to take on solo paths.</p> <p>At Gamescom on Wednesday, I played a mission named Drug Lab, set in a decrepit building filled with lower ranking members of a violent cartel. While the previous games used the Unreal Engine, this one is built with EA DICE's superior Frostbite 2 technology so each environment is absolutely loaded with destructible items. With enough gun fire, stone pillars can be obliterated into skeletal poles of shrapnel and wire, while furniture is splintered into millions of wood chips. </p> <p>The cover system works well. Approaching a wall or scenic object and hitting a button locks you to it, allowing you to aim and shoot from safety or just spray gun fire without looking. Players can disengage from this at any time by just pulling back on the analogue controller; or you can use the gun sight to target another cover position, then hit the button to whiz to it \u2013 allowing you to zip about from one safe place to the next. It's not revolutionary, but in a cover-based shooter this stuff is important to get right.</p> <p>From here, it's all about legging it through the building, up the stairs and through derelict rooms, shooting the bad guys. Players score better for using co-op tactics like flanking. Points boost a meter in the top centre of the screen and when this fills you get access to the Overkill mode. When one player hits this, both get a timed sequence of ultra damage, but if both instigate overkill together, they go into a bullet time sequence for added destructive effect. Again, not a single original idea in sight, but the systems combine well \u2013 and to visually impressive effect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394961748\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345466807050/Army-Two-Devils-Cartel-006.jpg\" alt=\"Army Two Devil's Cartel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The action leads out onto a rooftop, where a helicopter evac has been arranged. While one player gets into the chopper and mans the mini-gun, the other must work along the rooftops, searching out an enemy with an RPG. It's exactly like one of the co-op missions in Modern Warfare 3. You see, a theme is sort of developing here: Army of Two remains silly, structurally derivative fun and despite a multitude of familiar moments, working out the most efficient ways to combine resources is still quite a kick if you completely disengage your brain and moral compass. </p> <p>\"We wanted to take the flanking and the weapons customisation from the first titles, add in the Frostbite engine and all the destruction, and give it all some really vsiceral production values,\" says producer Zach Mumbach. \"There are lots of big moments, and it's not about watching them, it's about playing them.</p> <p>\"And whatever positive effects you have in the world, you're rewarded for that \u2013 not only in terms of Overkill points but with money. And that feeds back into weapon customisation. You can bring out custom guns for different situations, combining shotguns, sniper rifles and all sorts.\"</p> <p>The Devil's Cartel allows drop-in drop-out online co-op as well as split-screen two player, and there will be other multiplayer modes, though those haven't been announced yet. There's no word on whether developer, Visceral Games, will be resurrecting the Aggro meter from Army of Two: 40th Day, which caused enemies to target the player with the most Aggro points, allowing the other to sneak around and flank them. It would provide some extra tactical clout to a title for which Overkill is both a game system and an accurate description.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel is out on PS3 and Xbox in March 2013</em></p>",
  "<p>You may have spotted that there is <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/teslamuseum?c=home\">a campaign afoot</a> to buy what was built (though used only briefly) as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_tesla\">Nikola Tesla</a>'s laboratory and turn it into a museum and science centre. Despite claims of neglect, Tesla evidently commands significant interest, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/17/nikola-tesla-museum-campaign-online\">with $500,000 of online donations pouring in within 48 hours</a>.</p> <p>The campaign is a marriage of the <a href=\"http://www.teslasciencecenter.org/a-brief-history/\">Tesla Science Centre</a> - a group who were interested simply in finding space for the Science Centre located in the Shoreham-Wading River High School to expand - and Indiegogo - the campaign <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/teslamuseum?c=home\">Let's Build a Goddam Tesla Museum</a> run by Matthew Inman of <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/\">The Oatmeal</a>.</p> <p>The Indiegogo website opens:</p> <blockquote> <p>Nikola Tesla was the father of the electric age. Despite having drop-kicked humanity into a second industrial revolution, up until recently he's been an unsung hero in history books.</p> </blockquote> <p>Calling someone \"the father of....\", or claiming a \"first\" usually sets warning bells ringing. <a href=\"http://www.jbsumner.com/blog/2011/06/the-f-word/\">This post by historian of science and technology James Sumner explains why</a>. It's also worth pointing out that this \"unsung\" hero already has <a href=\"http://www.tesla-museum.org/meni_en/nt.php?link=muzej/m&amp;opc=sub2\">an artefact- and manuscript-filled museum</a> devoted to him in Belgrade, <a href=\"http://www.teslamemorialsociety.org/about.htm\">a society</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_Airport\">an airport</a>, as well as plenty of interest from historians.</p> <p>Inman had already <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla\">produced a comic piece</a> testifying to Tesla being \"the greatest geek who ever lived\", as \"inventor\" of alternating current, and a host of other things. Tesla here is the hero not just for his undoubted vision and talents, but for being \"a tinkerer\" and \"a geek\". He is contrasted with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_edison\">Thomas Edison</a>, the villain of the piece, who \"was not a geek; he was a CEO\". </p> <p>Quite rightly, even though it was comedic hyperbole, Inman's version of Tesla was countered by Alex Knapp at Forbes with the sensibly-named post, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/05/18/nikola-tesla-wasnt-god-and-thomas-edison-wasnt-the-devil/\">Nikola Tesla Wasn't God And Thomas Edison Wasn't The Devil</a>. Overall, the point is that technological innovations require a large number of people and an enormous amount of work to be developed and brought into practical use. Apart from meaning that many more than one individual are responsible, it is also the case that if any of these individuals had not existed, the innovation would most likely have happened anyway.</p> <p>The Oatmeal - in nice style - <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/blog/tesla_response\">produced a response</a>. These pieces are old news, and I don't intend to go through the rights and wrongs of each claim. What strikes me now, in this context, is Inman's characterisations of the two. Tesla is thrilled with pure invention, and typical of \"geeks\" who \"forget food, sleep, friends, love everything\", and \"abandon the world around them\". Edison is a \"douchebag\", in part for his statement \"Anything that won't sell, I don't want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.\"</p> <p>The words sell and success leap out, quickly leading the reader to assume Edison was just in it for the money (as he, like many others, may have been), but let's look at that quote a little more closely. Actually, he says that utility is what he's after - useful things, that people will actually use. Is that so bad? Thinking of the ends as well as the means can be a moral position as well as a business decision.</p> <p>While I, as someone who deals professionally with scientific heritage, am very much sympathetic to the aim of preserving an early 20th century building designed for scientific work, I harbour a tiny misgiving about what this background to the campaign might do for its future (if all goes to plan) as a science centre.</p> <p>Science centres, as opposed to history of science museums, tend to present knowledge in a somewhat disembodied way, as packages of information separated from the contexts - the period, the place, the people, the \"<a href=\"http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/sts-observatory/2012/06/15/turing-working-worlds-and-the-universal-government-machine/\">working worlds</a>\" - in which they were produced and used. However, a science centre located in an historic building that brings direct reminders of such real-world things should be a perfect place to explore how science actually happens in the world: looking at science as a process that concerns us all, not just science geeks.</p> <p>It would be extremely churlish of me not to wish success to a non-profit campaign for an educational facility. Likewise, given the success of the campaign, who am I to argue with the power of fairy-stories? Yet with this connection to a celebration of Tesla as a heroic genius, lauded for choosing to withdraw from the world (despite his large number of patents and involvement with businesses and the military), I fear that the real advantage of the unique location may be lost.</p>",

  "<p>Downing Street has said Britain is still committed to seeking a diplomatic solution with Ecuador in the standoff over the proposed extradition to Sweden of Julian Assange.</p> <p>But British diplomats in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, and in other regional capitals have communicated the message that David Cameron is adamant Assange will not be granted safe passage. They say Britain is under a legal obligation to extradite Assange to Sweden to face allegations of sexual misconduct.</p> <p>The government's thinking was outlined by the prime minister's spokesman at the weekly Downing Street lobby briefing. The spokesman said: \"Our hope is that we can reach a diplomatic solution and we are doing what we can to achieve that.</p> <p>\"We will not grant safe passage for Mr Assange. Under our law, having exhausted all the options of appeal, we are obliged to extradite him to Sweden. It is our intention to carry out that obligation. We will continue talking to the Ecuadorean government and others to try and find a diplomatic solution here.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-takes-aim-us\" title=\"\">Assange appeared on the first-floor balcony of the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge</a> to declare he was facing a \"witch-hunt\" led by the US. Assange was granted political asylum last week by Rafael Correa, Ecuador's president, two months after the WikiLeaks founder sought refuge in the embassy.</p> <p>Ecuador tried to maintain diplomatic pressure on Britain, which warned last week it could revoke the diplomatic status of its embassy, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/20/julian-assange-uk-south-america\" title=\"\">convening a meeting of foreign ministers from the 12-strong Unasur South American union</a> in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city. The ministers condemned the British warning over the status of Ecuador's embassy but declined to endorse Correa's decision to grant asylum to Assange.</p> <p>Downing Street said British diplomats had been explaining to members of Unasur why Britain was determined to extradite Assange. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"We are obliged to extradite this man. He faces some very serious allegations in Sweden. The extradition case has been heard in our courts. We have been through the process. We now have to proceed with our obligation, which is to extradite him to Sweden.</p> <p>\"He [the prime minister] thinks we need to meet our obligations and that means extraditing him to Sweden. We will be making our position clear to the Ecuadorean government, to others in that region, to explain why this is the process and why we have to follow this process under the law.\"</p> <p>The spokesman defended the Foreign Office's decision to write to Ecuadorean officials last week pointing out that Britain could, under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, revoke the diplomatic status of its embassy if it \"ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post\". William Hague, the foreign secretary, denied Ecuadorean claims that this amounted to a threat to storm the embassy.</p> <p>The prime minister's spokesman said: \"All we were doing last week was setting out the position as it stands. We were simply clarifying the legal position, no more than that. We will continue to talk to the Ecuadoreans to try to find a way forward here.\"</p>",
  "<p>Millions of people in England and Wales are living under \"quasi-feudal\" leasehold laws which allow them to be exploited by unscrupulous managing agents charging \u00a32.5bn a year, according to a report by the thinktank <a href=\"http://www.centreforum.org/\" title=\"Centre Forum homepage\">CentreForum</a> which calls for sweeping reform of the sector.</p> <p>The study found that tribunal disputes between leaseholders and freeholders have quadrupled in the past decade, with a significant rise in cases involving inflated service charges and the activities of connected companies, such as those that provide buildings insurance.</p> <p>The report's authors, Chris Paterson and Thomas Brooks, said: \"At present, freeholders generally have full control over property management. This means that leaseholders, who may own rights to a property for 99 or even 999 years \u2013 and therefore have the primary financial and emotional interest in that property \u2013 are left to foot the bill while being effectively excluded from its management.</p> <p>\"CentreForum believes this frequently gives freeholders little incentive to ensure leaseholders get good value or quality service.\"</p> <p>Guardian Money has featured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/feb/12/peverel-tenants-fighting-back\" title=\"The Peverel tenants who are fighting back\">multiple examples of leasehold battles</a>, many involving large, new, city centre developments where residents complain of soaring service charges and poorly managed properties.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-111/episode-3\" title=\"Dispatches: Property Nightmare: The Truth About Leaseholds\">Dispatches programme</a> to be broadcast on Channel 4 at 8pm tonight features Rona Buretto, who bought her one-bed flat in Hounslow, London, almost 15 years ago.</p> <p>As one of 70 leaseholders in the block, Buretto's problems began when her service charge started going up. \"We started with \u00a3700 a year for the flat, but now I'm paying that almost for a quarter.\" Yet rather than improving, the service provided had, she said, \"got much, much worse.\" Tenants in the block are now taking the managing agents to a <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/residential-property\" title=\"HM Courts  Tribunals: Residential Property Tribunal guidance\">leasehold valuation tribunal</a> (LVT).</p> <p>CentreForum argues that a light-touch, independent regulator for leasehold managing agents is essential if the owners of Britain's 2.5m leasehold properties are to be given sufficient protection.</p> <p>It said managing agents should be forced to join an ombudsman scheme and the LVT process reformed, in particular to prevent freeholders from recouping legal costs through service charges.</p> <p>CentreForum also called for the threat of forfeiture, which means leaseholders can lose the full value of their property for minor debts, to be removed. Freeholders should also not be able to charge leaseholders who modify their properties, unless it can be provided that the work would reduce its value.</p> <p>In 2002, \"commonhold\" was introduced as an alternative to leasehold, but the CentreForum report found it had failed almost completely. \"Only 15 developments use this form of ownership despite its significant advantages. This represents a major market failure,\" CentreForum said. It argued that commonhold should be promoted as an alternative to leasehold, particularly on new developments.</p> <p>Calls for reform of leasehold are finding cross-party support. Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley said: \"Leaseholders need far greater protection. At present there is legal torture of vulnerable groups including elderly, frail people on limited incomes and often limited life expectancy. Regulation and reform are urgently required. Government and parliament must act.\"</p> <p>Labour MP Barry Gardiner said: \"There is a real sense of growing momentum and cross-party consensus on this issue \u2013 it is now time to revisit leasehold reform. These proposals would cost the government nothing and would at a stroke transform the lives of millions of leaseholders.\"</p> <p>But housing minister Grant Shapps has set himself against reform: \"Landlords have a responsibility to act in a socially acceptable manner, but more and more red tape is not the answer.\"</p> <p>Shapps said the vast majority of leaseholders were happy with the service they received from their freeholder and that \"burdensome legislation\" would mean they ended up paying higher costs.</p> <p>\"Leaseholders have access to free advice from <a href=\"http://www.lease-advice.org/\" title=\"Leasehold Advisory Service homepage\">LEASE</a>, which has had its funding secured by this government, and the <a href=\"http://www.lease-advice.org/publications/documents/document.asp?item=18\" title=\"Leasehold Valuation Tribunal\">Leasehold Valuation Tribunal</a> offers an accessible recourse for those who feel any maintenance charges are unacceptable,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Scott, the blockbuster director and producer who has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott-director-dies\">died at the age of 68</a>, began his career as an actor \u2013 sort of. His first film credit, aged 16, was as the star of his brother Ridley's student short, Boy and Bicycle. He cycles down to the docks, puffs a fag and contemplates the water.

He was a director with a great enthusiasm for the business of quickening pulses and pushing buttons, flogging popcorn and ringing tills. Unlike his brother, he wasn't concerned with peddling an intellectual agenda, or with provoking more than fleeting deep thought in his audience. This won him less critical acclaim, but it arguably also freed up his films \u2013&#xa0;at best glorious, hedonistic Hollywood entertainment. </p> <p>His directorial debut was something of an anomaly, however.

  "<p>It transformed the airline business with its no-frills approach to flying and now Ryanair is considering the same approach with airports after the budget carrier confirmed its interest in acquiring London Stansted.</p> <p>The Dublin-based airline has held discussions over taking a 25% stake in the Essex airport, which has a price tag of more than \u00a31bn. The current owner, BAA, announced on Monday that it is ending a protracted legal battle to prevent the sale of Stansted, which had been ordered by the Competition Commission in 2009 but had been hotly contested by BAA.</p> <p>A spokesman for Ryanair, which operates 41 planes from the airport, said the carrier would be interested in a deal following the BAA announcement.</p> <p>Last month Howard Millar, Ryanair's deputy chief executive, said the airline has been approached by potential buyers with the view to joining a consortium bid. He said: \"We have met these consortia and they want us to be an anchor tenant.\"</p> <p>Ryanair has long campaigned to have airports remade in its low-cost image, and has cited Stansted as an example of the \"Taj Mahal\" facilities that are out-of-kilter with the low-cost model that now dominates the European short-haul market.</p> <p>A Ryanair-owned airport would emphasise low cost and quick turnarounds, so the airline will speed up the journey from check-in to security and the departure gate if it can. \"We want as small and efficient a facility as possible,\" said a Ryanair spokesman.</p> <p>At Stansted, however, that would probably have to apply to a new terminal. The current terminal, designed by renowned British architect Lord Foster, embodies the \"glass palaces\" that are hated by Ryanair's outspoken boss, Michael O'Leary, because the cost of building them is recouped in higher landing fees that in turn result in steep fare increases. Passengers would also be expected to walk on and off airplanes via steps, instead of the airport bridges that are common at Heathrow.</p> <p>\"The future for short-haul airlines in Europe is walk-on and walk-off services,\" said the spokesman.</p> <p>However, shops and restaurants would still be available in departure terminals, disproving conspiracy theories that Ryanair would limit refreshments at airports in order to boost onboard food and drink sales. \"There would need to be restaurants and bars, we accept that,\" said the spokesman.</p> <p>Last year, Stansted posted an operating profit of \u00a339.4m, compared with \u00a3526.8m at Heathrow, but Ryanair believes that would be even bigger if the owner lowered its landing charges to encourage more traffic \u2013 which in turn could trigger the return of Ryanair routes that have been pulled by the carrier in recent years in a protest over fees.</p> <p>A spokesman for Ryanair said on Monday that if the airline did not take a stake it would also be interested in giving long-term assurances to bidders over its commitment to the airport.</p> <p>Ryanair and its biggest Stansted rival, easyJet, have been pulling capacity out of the airport over the past five years, reflecting their displeasure over rising landing fees.</p> <p>The Ryanair spokesman said the airline would be interested in returning the airport to pre-boom levels of use, when it handled 24 million passengers a year compared with 18 million now.</p> <p>\"There is huge growth potential there and we would be very interested in discussing the future of Stansted with any groups looking at a potential purpose.\"</p> <p>Stansted is now Britain's fourth largest airport, having slipped behind Manchester, which carried 18.8 million passengers last year \u2013 760,000 more than Stansted. The Essex airport will be BAA's third major disposal following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/21/baa-sells-gatwick\" title=\"\">sale of Gatwick in 2009 </a>and the disposal of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/23/baa-sells-edinburgh-airport-gip\" title=\"\">Edinburgh airport in 2012</a>. Both times the airports were acquired by Global Infrastructure Partners, a New York-based investment group, but it is believed that GIP is not interested in bidding this time. As the owner of London's City airport, it is also likely that any offer would face watchdog scrutiny.</p> <p>As well as Ryanair, other potential bidders include Manchester Airports Group, which has expressed a strong interest in Stansted.</p> <p>It is not unknown for airlines to invest in airports. Germany's Lufthansa owns 10% of Frankfurt airport and has a joint venture in a terminal at Munich airport. Ryanair also advised on the design of a terminal at Charleroi airport in Belgium.</p> <p>However, some experts have warned that Ryanair's interest could lead to other carriers quitting the airport.</p> <p>Chris Tarry, an airline industry consultant, said other airlines might be deterred from using Stansted if Ryanair became a co-owner of the airport. \"Ryanair is in a dominant position at Stansted and short-haul airlines already have concerns about going there because they already have a very forceful competitor there. So what will they think if that competitor also becomes a shareholder in Stansted?\"</p> <p>BAA said it would not challenge a recent loss in the court of appeal over the commission ruling and will sell the airport. Stansted is valued at just over \u00a31.3bn according to a formula used by the Civil Aviation Authority, the industry regulator, to calculate landing charges at the airport. However, some industry observers view \u00a31bn as a par bid for the asset.</p> <p>\"Having carefully considered the court of appeal's recent ruling, BAA has decided not to appeal to the supreme court and is now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport,\" said BAA. Last week BAA's biggest shareholder, Spanish conglomerate Ferrovial, announced an agreement to sell 10% of BAA to Qatar's sovereign wealth fund in a transaction that would give <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/17/qatar-buy-20-baa-share-heathrow\" title=\"\">Qatar Holding a 20% stake in BAA's parent company</a>.</p>",
  "<p>I'm always interested in situations where preconceptions clash with hard facts and cause disquiet among partisans in one camp or another. Paul Ryan's promotion to Mitt Romney's ideological minder and running mate last week was one such example. (Should conservatives be thrilled or alarmed?) So was last <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/striking-south-african-miners-face-company-ultimatum\" title=\"\">Thursday's police massacre</a> of 34 striking miners in South Africa.</p> <p>If it had happened under the old apartheid regime \u2013 as it did at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre\" title=\"\">Sharpeville in 1960</a> when 69 protesters died or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto_uprising\" title=\"\">far bloodier student uprising</a> when 700 were killed in 1976 \u2013 there would have been sustained uproar around the world.</p> <p>On Friday morning it did not even lead BBC bulletins and was on only one front page I saw. Like many protests and demonstrations \u2013 in South Africa, in Britain and in most places \u2013 it didn't get much media attention until it turned nasty. It's a paradox to ponder \u2013 a dangerous one.</p> <p>But in this case surely the non-reporting problem would be exacerbated because the police shooting at the Marikana platinum mine in Rustenburg, north of Johannesburg, presented us with a narrative with which we were unfamiliar, uneasy even. It was a hark back to the bad old days of oppression by the white minority regime.</p> <p>For liberals, black majority rule was going to be the answer \u2013 it still is \u2013 so a grim setback to progress like this is unsettling. The South African Nobel laureate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Gordimer\" title=\"\">Nadine Gordimer</a> did not hesitate to speak out, but few are so bold or eminent.</p> <p>The massacre doesn't fit any of the familiar stereotypes into which media organisations struggle to slot the daily flow of news. If only it had happened in Damascus we'd all have known what to do, this year anyway. Last year we would have said: \"No, nothing like that happens in Syria, even in the Arab Spring. It can't be significant,\" or \"no, it's not on Reuters or in the New York Times\".</p> <p>In fact, the strike and its context sounds increasingly familiar as details start to trickle out. The 3,000 striking miners have been demanding a tripling of their 4,000-rand-a-month (\u00a3306) salary from Lonmin, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonmin\" title=\"\">the London-based mine owner</a>. It was formerly known as Lonrho (Tiny Rowlands was its boss) and is struggling to survive as well as close to breaching its debt limits, as world platinum prices plunge.</p> <p>That doesn't much matter to struggling miners and their families. Nationalise the mines, say young radicals such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/julius-malema\" title=\"\">Julius Malema</a>, the former African National Congress (ANC) youth leader who stirred the strikers' fervour in a speech to the vast crowd on Saturday. Jacob Zuma, current ANC leader and South African president, should resign too, Malema helpfully added. Not a smart thing to say at a time like this by a man already expelled for troublemaking.</p> <p>You can see why the Zuma administration was slow off the mark, even allowing for the sloth, corruption and aloofness that its critics allege with ever greater emphasis. Returning hastily from a foreign trip, Zuma has now declared a week of national mourning. He will no doubt deplore Lonmin's call on strikers to return to work or face the sack (the threat didn't seem to be working on Monday morning).</p> <p>But it's likely to prove too little too late. To the strikers, the traditional National Union of Mineworkers was judged to be too cautious. It was also deemed too close to the ANC, an old ally from the apartheid era, and along with Cosatu, the South African TUC, too cosy with the new black South African elite and its white business leadership, Lonmin included. No wonder Zuma said \"it's not the day to apportion blame\". He must hope the commission of inquiry will kick it into the elephant grass.</p> <p>It's an old story that you could probably hear near any deep mineshaft in the world. The reaction is fairly familiar too: a militant breakaway in the shape of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union to which young miners \u2013 known as \"Born Frees\" for obvious reasons \u2013 flocked. The police defence is familiar too. The strikers were armed and angry, they had killed two policemen and an Lonmin official in recent days. It was a public order issue.</p> <p>True enough, up to a point. None of us would like to be surrounded by angry young men with machetes, guns and tribal loyalties. But the police were armed too, with automatic weapons. They had water cannon, horses, radio contact with a helicopter, always a threatening noise above any demo. And \u2013 as with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a> in Derry in 1972, 13 deaths that still reverberate \u2013 it's always a good test to count the dead on both sides.</p> <p>A striker may have fired first \u2013 as reported by a photographer \u2013 but there were no police fatalities in Thursday's three minutes of mayhem. Two successive police chiefs have been forced to resign over corruption and incompetence. The old \"shoot first, ask questions later\" culture of Sharpeville and Soweto lingers on.</p> <p>The wider context for the Marikana confrontation is growing disillusionment with the pace of progress 18 years after the ANC first took power under its hero, Nelson Mandela. Jobs, healthcare, housing, electricity supplies, sanitation and educational reform: more may have been expected than could quickly be delivered, but black voters see their own leaders \"meeting capitalists in air-conditioned offices\", as Malema put it.</p> <p>So strikes and protests have increased, not led by the ANC and the big unions, as in the apartheid era \u2013 such people are now in power \u2013 but by the young. Two million South Africans go on strike every year but it goes largely unreported, an expert warned on the radio. It's easy to see why, but it's also unhealthy.</p> <p>Do we \u2013 or the French media for that matter \u2013 do better? The riots last week in Toulouse and \u2013 much closer to Dover \u2013 in Amiens were manifestations of minority frustration, frequently staged but usually ignored. France is a country with a deeply rooted culture of street protest, the legacy of 1789. Britain too, albeit much less self-consciously.</p> <p>Dairy farmers <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18930618\" title=\"\">have been protesting lately</a> over poor to zero profit margins exacted by big supermarket chains. Did you know? In the past year, students have marched (with plenty of publicity) over fees, the unions over public spending cuts. Tanker drivers blockade petrol refineries and the TV crews turn up.</p> <p>But how much public support does that generate? I'm not sure. Many people judge such protests on their individual merits rather than leap instinctively to one side of the barricade or the other. That's what seems to be happening over Julian Assange's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-takes-aim-us\" title=\"\">well-publicised battles</a>.</p> <p>And should there <em>always</em> be more coverage than is now fashionable to keep us all in touch with other people's gripes? It was a demo against the Tottenham police failure to explain why Mark Duggan had been shot during a surveillance operation that triggered last August's mix of protest and opportunistic riots. Did mainstream media coverage make things better or worse? Or does social media now dictate the pace?</p> <p>On a smaller canvas, the BNP and its fellow travellers on the far right routinely try to exploit racially charged controversy, not least over the <a href=\"http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1508280_three-arrested-as-far-right-groups-try-to-storm-rochdale-town-hall-in-protest-over-grooming-case\" title=\"\">Lancashire sex grooming cases,</a> which inspired a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01g986h\" title=\"\">startling two-parter</a> in BBC1's Silent Witness series. Such flare-ups are rarely reported beyond the locality and \u2013 as, the Guardian reports on Monday \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/19/far-right-fragmenting-bnp\" title=\"\">far right is currently fragmenting</a>. But it will be back. Should we hear more about such protests when (if) they have clearly become part of a wider trend?</p> <p>Surely it is always unhealthy to pretend things aren't happening when they are? On balance, I think we should, however unsettling or unsavoury they sometimes are.</p>",
  "<p>As I write, we are currently lingering between the end of the the Olympics and the start of the Paralympics 2012. For the vast majority of us, we seem to be filled with euphoric pride following Team GB's performances, but now shocked by the sudden cold turkey sensation following the closing ceremony.</p> <p>Over the past few days, to compensate the loss, I have viewed countless <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/12/london-2012-mo-farah-usain-bolt-tribute\">Mo Farah</a> postures and reruns of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2012/aug/06/usain-bolt-gold-100m-brick-video?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3486\">Usain Bolt's 100m sprint in brick-by-brick reconstructions</a>. When feeling occasionally serious, I've read all <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/legacy/youth/\">references</a> to education and the decisions politicians make to continue funding (or not) and how sport and PE in school can make a difference to the next generation of Olympians.</p> <p>However, putting current affairs abruptly aside, have we been ignoring the chalk face?</p> <p>Now, I know it's the summer holidays and like anyone, I should be sunning myself on some far-off exotic shore and taking a moment to switch off, but instead this summer, I am at home in London enjoying life with our son following his second operation. Deciding not to jet off has allowed me to pause for reflection and take each day very slowly. I've never had a more relaxing break, but despite the niceties, one issue has been niggling away at the back of my mind and I've have been left wondering how on earth I will go about informing staff about all the latest <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/\">Department for Education</a> changes for September 2012.</p> <p>I write this particular post because I often read and research what is going on in our field; I am expecting an autumn of discontent within the education sector. I suspect the pensions debate will continue as many of us will start to really understand our payslips and notice a difference, but as the 1 September looms, there are changes that are due to kickstart and we all must take note.</p> <p>As a school, we have already adapted, consulted, modified and rewritten our practices, but I still feel apprehensive. How will our staff feel? I would imagine many schools will sense the same and will continue to do so until we all settle into the new procedures and collaborate once more.</p> <p>As an example, for the past 12 years, I have been involved with supporting all pathways and new teachers into school. This September, what I will not communicate to newbies, is that over the past two months I have been dissatisfied. The goalposts have shifted again and discontent may prevail until we readjust.</p> <p>Not only has Gove suddenly scrapped the requirement for anyone to have QTS in order to work within an academy and free school, but the new Teacher Standards come into force in a few weeks time for all teachers (part B only). Are you up to date?</p> <p>I am also left with a dilemma.

  "<p>This book was written in response to the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand to raise funds for the families affected by the quake. It is the story of Tiger, a cat who wakes to the earthquake and runs away in fright only to find that he is lost and can't find his way home to Emma, his beloved owner.</p> <p>Tiger is depicted as a bright marmalade orange cat, a vivid point of colour against the otherwise dark background of the illustrations which caught my toddler's attention immediately. She pointed to him on each page and said \"Harry\" which is the name of our own long suffering cat (he has learned to submit to Ellie's frequent and passionate demonstrations of affection in a resigned manner).</p> <p>All ends well (phew!) and there is even a useful glossary of earthquake related words for the older child at the end of the story.

  "<p>Madonna has condemned the two-year jail sentence given to three members of the Russian band Pussy Riot, describing the conviction as \"inhumane\".</p> <p>On Friday, Maria Alyokhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">found guilty</a> of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred, receiving a two-year prison sentence. The women had been charged in connection with an anti-Putin <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/06/russian-punks-pussy-riot-putin-protest\" title=\"\">\"punk prayer\"</a>, performed inside Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in February. As Madonna pointed out, the protest lasted only 40 seconds \u2013 although it has since been viewed by millions online.</p> <p>\"Even if one disagrees with the location or how they chose to express themselves, the sentence is too harsh and in fact is inhumane,\" Madonna wrote on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151181760219402&amp;set=a.130838589401.130921.10584534401&amp;type=1&amp;theater\" title=\"\">Facebook</a>. \"I call on all those who love freedom to condemn this unjust punishment. I urge artists around the world to speak up in protest against this travesty. They've spent enough time in jail. I call on ALL of Russia to let Pussy Riot go free.\"</p> <p>Alyokhina, Tolokonnikova and Samutsevich had already been held for more than five months, without trial, by the time Madonna first voiced her support. At the beginning of August, when artists such as Faith No More, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/24/franz-ferdinand-chili-peppers-pussy-riot\" title=\"\">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/02/pussy-riot-uk-music-putin\" title=\"\">Pete Townshend</a>, Franz Ferdinand, Sting and Jarvis Cocker had condemned the women's arrest, Madonna's only comment on the matter, to a Russian television network, was that she was \"sorry that they've been arrested\". That changed when the singer prepared to play a stadium gig in Moscow, first by asking for the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/06/madonna-pussy-riot-putin-russia\" title=\"\"> judge's leniency</a> and then by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/07/pussy-riot-madonna-concert-plea\" title=\"\">appearing on stage in a balaclava</a> with the band's name stenciled on her back.</p> <p>Putin supporters responded with disapproval: deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin suggested <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/09/pussy-riot-madonna-called-moralising-slut\" title=\"\">Madonna was a \"slut</a> \u2026 lecturing everyone on morality\". But the singer seemed emboldened: at an appearance in Kiev she spoke out in favour of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/yulia-tymoshenko\" title=\"\">Yulia Tymoshenko</a>, Ukraine's jailed former prime minister, advising the crowd to \"fight for what is right\". She also advocated against anti-gay legislation in St Petersburg, referring to a new law as a \"ridiculous atrocity\". Ten anti-gay activists are now suing Madonna, demanding $10m for \"moral damages and suffering\".</p>",
  "<p>Tributes have continued to pour in for the British film director Tony Scott, who jumped to his death from the Vincent Thomas suspension bridge over Los Angeles harbour on Sunday night.</p> <p>Police confirmed that a note left in Scott's black Toyota Prius listed only contact information, contrary to earlier reports. However, a suicide note was later found at the director's office. Tributes were posted on Twitter by, among others, the actor Peter Fonda, Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich, Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly, Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright, comic and actor Stephen Fry, director Joe Carnahan, and Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood.</p> <p>\"Wow!

  "<p>When Spanish mayor Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/15/spanish-robin-hood-sanchez-gordillo\" title=\"\">recently led farmers on a supermarket sweep</a>, raiding the local shops for food as part of a campaign against austerity, his political immunity as an elected assembly member protected him from arrest. He now asks other local mayors to ignore central government demands for budget cuts and refuse to implement evictions and lay-offs. In this era of austerity, such flagrant disrespect for the law ought to be encouraged. Sometimes, the greatest strength of popular movements is their capacity to disrupt. So here, for the benefit of imaginative <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932012_Spanish_protests\" title=\"\"><em>indignados</em></a>, are five examples of civil disobedience.</p> <h2>1. Salt March</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942696\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345223452298/Salt-March-008.jpg\" alt=\"Salt March\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahatma Gandhi led the Salt March in protest against the government monopoly on salt production. Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gandhi's defiance of British colonial laws over the empire's salt monopoly, beginning in March 1930, sparked a wave of civil disobedience that contributed to expelling the British empire. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March\" title=\"\">Salt laws</a> taxed the production of Indian salt so that the country had to import British salt. Gandhi and his supporters began a long, expanding march to produce salt and transport it without paying the tax. It did not stop the practice: the British suppressed the march fiercely, arresting tens of thousands, and refused to make any concessions. It was also limited by its failure to win Muslim support.</p> <p>However, the campaign had long-term effects that weighed against its failure to win its immediate goals. In the first instance, it was inspiring for those taking part, since many had never been organised before. Second, it announced to the world that the Indian masses were a serious force, and that the British authorities had been forced to negotiate with their leader. Third, it stimulated further waves of civil disobedience. Finally, the Salt March had a tremendous influence on the thinking and strategy of other insurgents, such as Martin Luther King.</p> <h2>2. Extremadura campaign</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942697\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345456819428/Extremadura--008.jpg\" alt=\"Extremadura \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farms in Extremadura were occupied by unemployed peasants during the 1936 election campaign.  Photograph: Prisma Bildagentur AG / Alamy/Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prisma Bildagentur AG / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Land reform was a priority in rural areas of Spain during the republican era. High countryside unemployment contributed to the election of the leftist Popular Front government. In Extremadura, during the 1936 election campaign, Popular Front candidates had promised quick land reform. Rather than wait for the government to deliver on its pledges, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremadura_campaign\" title=\"\">unemployed peasants began to occupy large estates</a>, starting with some 3,000 farms in the Badajoz province. The government, faced with popular unrest, legalised the early occupations. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were re-settled.</p> <p>But it was not just a question of taking over the land. There was a debate about what should be done with it \u2013 whether it should be collectivised or allotted to individual owners. The seizures provided not just land and work, but also a democratic forum, a focus for arguments about the whole future development of the society. Or so it was until the nationalist forces of General Franco conquered the territory and slaughtered the peasants and their leftist leaders.</p> <h2>3. Flying pickets and sit-ins</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942698\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345456380872/Great-Depression--008.jpg\" alt=\"Great Depression \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great Depression sparked a wave of militancy that produced legal support for US workers for the first time.  Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Industrial struggles in the US historically had a pattern of near-insurgency, largely due to violent collusion between the government and employers, until the New Deal period. A wave of militancy during the Great Depression produced legal and institutional support for US workers for the first time.</p> <p>Unorganised workers in textile plants and coal mines, hammered by the recession but also inspired by Franklin Roosevelt's promise to look after industrial workers, began a series of desperate struggles against pay cuts and job losses. But in order to win, they had to opt for the most disruptive tactics, weathering the violence of strikebreakers, police and in some states the imposition of martial law.</p> <p>Enter the \"flying squadrons\" of pickets marching from town to town during the <a href=\"http://www.arete-designs.com/southernprimer/textile.html\" title=\"\">textile strike of 1934</a>, urging workers to walk out. This was particularly important because these workers were often distributed in small production facilities, and had little industrial muscle by themselves. A second key moment was a series of sit-ins by workers in steel and auto factories. This involved workers obstructing production simply by occupying a strategic area of a plant and refusing to move: a highly effective tactic that was also less violent than the picket lines and was later used by civil rights and anti-Vietnam war campaigners.</p> <h2>4. Dismantling unwanted enterprises</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345223779709/Jose-Bove-tractor-001.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Bove tractor\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 and his supporters dismantled the Millau branch of McDonalds brick by brick. Photograph: Georges Bartoli/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georges Bartoli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fast food chain McDonalds had been welcomed into many European countries with no questions asked when it first expanded to the continent in the 1970s. France was always a different matter, as public distaste for its <a href=\"http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/malbouffe\" title=\"\"><em>malbouffe</em></a> was widespread. The chain's attempt to open a branch in Millau in 1999 aroused the interest of Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, a militant farmer and member of the agricultural union Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne. Before the branch was fully built, Bov\u00e9 and his supporters <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1171329.stm\" title=\"\">arrived and began to dismantle it</a>, brick by brick.</p> <p>Such actions are largely symbolic. But Bov\u00e9's was just one of a wider series of stunts disrupting the purveyors of GM and junk food flooding the French market. These actions brought to the fore not just Bov\u00e9, but an entire layer of agricultural activists. They formed a significant part of the anti-capitalist movement and later joined the struggle against the European constitutional treaty, as part of the coalition that delivered the \"No\" vote.</p> <h2>5. Poll tax non-payment</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345223873582/poll-tax-demo-001.jpg\" alt=\"poll tax demo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A network of anti-poll-tax campaigns brought protesters together. Photograph: Denis Thorpe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Thorpe/taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most dramatic moment in the anti-poll tax campaign may well have been the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8593158.stm\" title=\"\">riot arising from a 200,000-strong protest</a> in central London on 31 March 1990. The police, quite unusually, came out on the losing side. While symbolically important, it arose from a series of tactical failures. You can surprise the authorities every once in a while, but they learn from their mistakes and incorporate the lessons into future plans. What is important is that underlying such spontaneous actions is a much more durable form of civil disobedience.</p> <p>In the case of the poll tax, a nationwide network of campaigns and non-payment unions had developed. These groups brought people who were ordinarily isolated, or not politically active, together. Their strategy was to resist at every step: refusing to register for the tax, contesting liability orders from the council (thus clogging up the legal system) and finally refusing payment. This was highly effective. Tax collection was ineffective, and the situation was polarised at great expense to the ruling Conservatives, who were forced to depose their leader and retreat from the full legislation.</p> <p>In each of these examples, the key question is neither violence nor non-violence, neither legality, nor illegality; it is disruption. Popular movements are engaged in civil disobedience whenever they recognise the society's dependence on their co-operation, cease co-operating, and actively disrupt its smooth functioning. This moves politicians to spittle-lathered furore. It is the way in which progress is made.</p>",
  "<p>It's often said that further education doesn't get enough media or political attention. It's one of the broadest categories of learning in the UK, spanning two government departments and, excluding schools, affecting <a href=\"http://www.thedataservice.org.uk/statistics/statisticalfirstrelease/sfr_current/\" title=\"\">4.2 million students in England alone</a>.</p> <p>Almost anyone who has attended university has been through some form of further education \u2013 be it A-levels, a foundation course, or an access course. Yet, despite all this, the issues affecting it are sidelined while the concerns of elite universities dominate the news agenda.</p> <p>But things look set to change. As the recession fuels demand for skills-led courses and better employment outcomes, further education has been thrown into the spotlight.</p> <p>One person who is well aware of the shifting field of play is<a href=\"http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/about/people/nus/officers/zoneconvenors/tonipearce/\" title=\"\"> Toni Pearce</a>, FE vice president for the NUS. Now one month into her second term, Pearce spent her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/24/nus-fe-vice-president-toni-pearce\" title=\"\">first year</a> running loud campaigns against cuts to EMA, adult learner funding and other support for FE students.</p> <p>This year she will be looking at the impact of A-level reforms, pushing for better information guidance, and lobbying hard against the most significant change to FE policy in recent years \u2013 the introduction of government loans to fund adult education courses.</p> <p>Previously any person over 24 who was hoping to take A-levels, a BTec or level 3 apprenticeship would have half their course fee subsidised by the government. But from next September, they will have to pay full fees or use the loan system the government is offering.</p> <p>\"The new loans will have a huge impact on people considering FE. A lot of these people are women and a lot are unemployed. There is probably a reason why you've had to put off your education, for personal reasons such as having to leave school or losing your job. You shouldn't be penalised for that.</p> <p>\"If you came from a background where higher education is normal, the idea of taking out a loan for a course is not that daunting. But if you're from a background where your family didn't go to university, then it is daunting. These people are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>\"I think that they're trying to level the playing field between further and higher education, but these people are more diverse, they're much more likely not to go into education if these barriers are put in their way.\"</p> <p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.thedataservice.org.uk/statistics/statisticalfirstrelease/sfr_current/\" title=\"\">statistics released by BIS</a> show that in 2010-11, 12.8% of learners in further education (excluding schools) had a learning difficulty or disability and 18% were from an ethnic minority background.</p> <p>As someone who did not attend university herself, instead rising through the NUS ranks after becoming union president at Cornwall College, Pearce is keen to emphasise that further education is key to supporting people into the labour market. It's not, she adds, \"a conveyor belt of young people who can do low paid work\".</p> <p>Some areas of further education are gradually getting more attention. The government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10297108\" title=\"\">recently announced it is increasing investment for apprenticeships to \u00a31.5 billion</a>. And <a href=\"http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Apprenticeships-programme-continues-to-grow-67c07.aspx\" title=\"\">statistics published in June by BIS </a>showed a continued increase in their uptake.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.157group.co.uk/\" title=\"\">157 Group</a>, which represents 27 further education colleges in England, says now the focus should widen to include other courses.</p> <p>Lynne Sedgemore CBE, executive director of the group says: \"Support for apprenticeships is very popular with the public, even though it is clear that they are not the whole answer to youth unemployment. We must not forget that there are other vocational courses to suit learners who are not apprentices, and these deliver real skills and qualifications valued by employers. They need to be promoted with equal vigour.\"</p> <p>Pearce is picking her way through policy with confidence. She has already won an important concession in the government's new loans policy, with further education minister John Hayes announcing that loans will be written off for students who complete access to higher education courses and go on to start at a university. There will also now be a \u00a350 million bursary fund to support mature students.</p> <p>And as further education becomes more politically important Pearce has been tipped as the next president of the NUS \u2013 though she hasn't confirmed whether or not she will run for the position.</p> <p>\"There's never been a FE president of the NUS,\" she says, \"but the majority of our members are in FE and I think that people don't necessarily realise that.</p> <p>\"Whether its me or someone else, somewhere along the line it needs to happen.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's easy for discussions on democracy to end up in the theoretical. Visions of the future of democracy, from the Adam Smith Institute to Occupy, seek fundamental shifts in how society and public services are organised. We need visionaries, but we also need action; the reality of change is that lots of little actions drive new attitudes.</p> <p>So in that vein, here are seven small things that you can do to improve local democracy in your area.</p> <p><strong>1. Check out a hyperlocal website or Facebook page </strong></p> <p>Every councillor worth their salt reads the local paper every day, but there's more and varied comment and opinion online. A little digging will get you past the angry ranters to the quality content.</p> <p><strong>2. Seed a surgery</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://socialmediasurgery.com\" title=\"\">Social media surgeries</a> are simple and very cheap peer-to-peer learning networks, which improve democracy by building people's capacity to contribute. You don't need anything more than a cafe with wi-fi, your laptop and a couple of friends.</p> <p><strong>3. Find your positive deviants</strong></p> <p>Look out for them both inside and outside your organisation. When people want to do something positive and participatory, they don't always call it democracy. The growing <a href=\"http://citycamp.com\" title=\"\">CityCamp network</a>, started in the US and <a href=\"http://ccbtn.demsoc.org\" title=\"\">now established here</a>, is one example, but there will be people in your area with the energy and drive to make things change. Find them online and help them create.</p> <p><strong>4. Put openness at the heart of organisational development</strong></p> <p>In a council, everyone works in democratic services. Increasingly they will work in localised and personalised services too. Staff and councillors need to have the new skills that this new way of working needs. You might not be the head of human resources, but you can put those skills into you and your team's development plans.</p> <p><strong>5. Call a public service partner</strong></p> <p>Talk to your partners about their consultation and engagement plan, and whether you can join your engagement work with theirs. Citizens don't usually care about organisational boundaries and the most dispiriting experience is making a comment and being told \"oh, that's not an issue for us\".</p> <p><strong>6. Be a confused citizen</strong></p> <p>Check out a local newspaper websaite for an area where you don't live, and pick out a news story that involves the council. Then go to the council's website and try to find information about the issue (beyond a press release). It will teach you some lessons about how it feels to be a democratic participant in your area.</p> <p><strong>7. Check the quality of your information</strong></p> <p>Hierarchies are turning into networks everywhere you look, and the website is no exception. Homepage and directories are being replaced by Facebook page and Twitter lists. That means the content your organisation creates needs to be simple, self-contained and linkable \u2013 not PDFs hidden in a database. Check the information you're responsible for. Does it meet that standard?</p> <p>You can probably run through that whole list in a lunch break without any technical skill or organisational superpower required. If a few more people in government took little positive actions like that every day, we'd soon have a better relationship between state and citizen, and better democracy.</p> <p><em>Anthony Zacharzewski is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.demsoc.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Democratic Society</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>In small businesses, owners often tend towards keeping account functions in-house. It can be quite a dilemma to consider outsourcing this function. Unfortunately a lot of businesses consider only the cost while making this decision and not the benefits. However, there are some highly positive aspects related to outsourcing which must be weighed against the costs.</p> <p><strong>To outsource or not:</strong> The real question to think about is: 'what can you do with the extra time you will have, if you outsource?' Can that time be used better, to bring more revenue by meeting, networking and building relationships with your customers? Consider whether you really need to do your accounting in-house or whether it could be outsourced without having any negative effects on the business, your employees and, most importantly, your customers. Perhaps in your small business accounting is a mundane task done in-house because it has always been done like that. Do you have the necessary skills to do the job, or would it be better to outsource to someone with the right skills who can do the same job in less time and in a more cost effective way?</p> <p><strong>Outsourcing company:</strong> There is lot to consider before you can outsource accounting. Check whether the vendor has got the appropriate skills to do the job \u2013 take note of qualifications. They should have a pool of qualifications in their company such as ICB (Institute of Certified Bookkeepers), ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants), and AAT (Association of Accounting Technicians). They should also be flexible enough to use various accounting software such as advance spreadsheets, Sage, MYOB, IRIS, QuickBooks and Xero.</p> <p>Consider how well respected they are in the market and how their current customers grade them. Ask for testimonials. Also, check how quickly they can turn around the job. Are they financially sound? Competitive? And, how flexible is the service level agreement? Check the conditions if you want to end the contract.</p> <p>Depending upon services outsourced \u2013 such as credit control or bookkeeping \u2013 the business will need to provide different information to the outsourcing company. This could be everything from giving information about your debtors for credit control, to raw records \u2013 such as invoices and bank statements for bookkeeping. If the business is looking for complete outsourcing (bookkeeping, payroll, VAT and annual accounts), they would need to provide the following:</p> <p>\u2022 Sales and purchase invoices</p> <p>\u2022 Bank statements and loan statements, if applicable</p> <p>\u2022 Pay-in books and cheque book</p> <p>\u2022 Petty cash details</p> <p>\u2022 Details of employees - personal and salary information</p> <p>\u2022 Stock level, if applicable</p> <p>\u2022 Debtors and creditors List</p> <p>There might be some further information needed, as requirements change depending on the business sector, as well as each individual client's needs.</p> <p><strong>Cost</strong></p> <p>Cost puts off most businesses from outsourcing. This could be because they consider it to be an additional, and therefore unnecessary, cost to the business; however, in reality, the savings can be quite considerable.</p> <p>These savings can include the running cost of accounting in-house. Businesses can increase revenue as time can now be used somewhere else and the cost of outsourcing is, of course, tax deductible.</p> <p>Any business seeking to outsource should get a quote from a few companies first to find the most competitive. It is important to pick the right provider, as picking the wrong one can prove very costly later. If the provider is picked solely on cost, it may not be right for your business-specific needs, as the provider might not be qualified to provide certain services and, in turn, you will not receive the right service or advice on time. This can not only get your business in trouble with tax authorities, but can cost the business financially in penalties and having to put it right.</p> <p>If done properly outsourcing can benefit your business.</p> <p><em>Deepaman Prabhakar is an accountant working for </em><a href=\"http://www.taxclaim.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Taxclaim Accountants</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>And so Gamescom is over. The European video game behemoth, which sits at the other side of the summer from E3, saw 275,000 visitors shuffle through its vast halls and its comparitively civilised business area, grabbing hands on time with the treats hinted at in Los Angeles in June. </p> <p>With Nintendo and Microsoft both absent, Sony seemed to take control of the event, introducing five original new titles at its press conference and delighting many tired games journalists with its fin de si\u00e8cle creativity and enthusiasm. The free-to-play MMO makers were out in force too, asserting their growing claims on the industry, while reliable old guns like Assassin's Creed, Fifa and Call of Duty did their best to shout above the cacophony. </p> <p>So who won? Who surprised us? And what general themes can we draw from gaming's biggest show? I put this question to four veteran games writers: Pat Garratt, founder of the ceaslessly prolific news site, <a href=\"http://www.vg247.com/\">VG247</a>; freelancer Dan Griliopoulos (PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun); Nathan Ditum, <a href=\"http://nathanditum.com/\">blogger</a> and producer of PlayStation Access TV; and Chris Dring, associate editor at trade publication, <a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/\">MCV</a>.</p> <p>Here's what they had to say:<br></p> <p><strong>So, a nice easy one to start with: what were your favourite games of the show?</strong><br><strong>Nathan Ditum:</strong> I've got two. Epic Mickey: The Power Of Two uses Disney's massive archive of brilliant and often forgotten characters in a way that fascinates me as a Hollywood nerd, and Warren Spector's such an interesting guy. My other favourite was Rain, a small PlayStation exclusive from Sony's Japan Studio that looks arty and sad and other things I'm a total sucker for.</p> <p><strong>Dan Griliopoulos:</strong> For me it was X-com. Just a loving tribute to one of the best strategy games of all time. The multiplayer promises endless variation, whilst the single player will have a compelling detect-shoot down-fight-loot-research-manufacture-equip loop. Far Cry 3 came a close second, then Sim City, and Impire. </p> <p><strong>Pat Garratt:</strong> Far Cry 3 was the best thing I saw. It's an open-world gun game based on a fight-for-survival story on a Lost-style desert island. It's completely stupid. I'm drawn to its drugs and bear attacks. Crucially, you can fist-fight a shark, which clearly makes it the most anticipated game of 2012. It's out at the beginning of December.</p> <p><strong>Chris Dring:</strong> Call of Duty: Black Ops II. After all the talk of new things, what I loved the most was something that everyone apparently is really bored of. The new multiplayer, although still very Call of Duty, has been given more than just a face lift and introduces another new level of strategy. I also really love the look of Hitman's Contracts mode. It is so good, Square Enix even threw a press conference to announce it.</p> <p><strong>Keith Stuart:</strong> I'm going for Dishonored, which is complex and compelling and seemingly \u2013 shock, horror \u2013 very intelligent. But like Nathan, I'm also interested in Rain by Sony's Japan studio, which reminds me very much of Konami's Lost in Shadow. I also enjoyed DmC, but then I love Ninja Theory games \u2013 they have a very different understanding of third-person combat than, say, Rocksteady, but it is very compelling. </p> <p><strong>And what were the biggest surprises?</strong><br><strong>DG: </strong>Lords of Football. Solid quality simulation of football management from a Sims/Theme Park POV. Makes interesting use of a town as a user interface. Surprised by it being any good at all. Other than that, Impire is an extremely good riff on the Dungeon Keeper theme.</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> The fact that Sony didn't show a new PS3, didn't cut the PlayStation Vita, and yet still romped home with a fantastic press conference was a surprise. Vita was all about the big brands pushing the format \u2013 and the wonderful Tearaway \u2013 while PS3 was all about new IP, most of which just looked fantastic. Not entirely sure the new PS3 games are system shifters, but they looked the sort of games us journalists will pick up on day one.</p> <p><strong>ND:</strong> I was surpised by just how much I hated Army Of Two: The Devil's Cartel, without even playing it. The dumber than rocks trailer was enough.</p> <p><strong>KS:</strong> It was actually okay fun to play, though still doesn't do enough with the co-op mechanic. I want to see crazy, idiotic synchronised stunts. My biggest surprise was Sony \u2013 five new IPs! The best quote I read about it was that Sony just won E3: two months late... Anyway, Pat?</p> <p><strong>PG:</strong> The biggest surprise of Gamescom 2012 for me was the German public's capacity for being fed into a human sausage machine in the name of seeing some computer games. Around 250,000 people turned up this year. I was only there for one of the public days, but I'm not sure I've ever seen so many people inside a single building. I couldn't play anything. Apparently the queue to see a ten-minute demo of Crysis 3 was over three hours long. It was honestly frightening. </p> <p>The organisers were forced to stop entry on one of the weekend days last year because the Messe was dangerously full, and it's obvious the overall experience for paying customers is diminished by the sheer scale of the show. It's pretty depressing to see young kids and parents standing completely bewildered in a hall the size of an aircraft hangar while thousands of teenagers bay for free T-shirts. So, the greatest surprise of the show for me is that fact that some of these people even bother.</p> <p><strong>Finally, the big one: what do you think were the key themes of Gamescom 2012?</strong><br><strong>CD:</strong> Free, free, free. It was all about games that cost nothing. Nintendo and Microsoft's stands were replaced by Wargaming and Trion Worlds and Gameforge. And these companies are all building or publishing free-to-play titles that compare with your big triple-A boxed games. EA announced a new free-to-play Command and Conquer, The Old Republic was there, Ubisoft unveiled three free-to-play companies. And of course, Dust 514 was there. The industry is changing, and although this can be scary to those of us used to the way the games industry has operated for the past 20 years, there's no denying it's all a bit exciting, too.</p> <p>In our traditional market, new IP was the order of the day. Are consumers bored? Well, the media certainly appeared to be, with much of the press praising the likes of Capcom and Sony for daring to do new things. Remember Me looked great, Tearaway was wonderful, as was the Sony Japan IP. You never know, daring to launch new IP might do something unspeakable and actually extend the life of these consoles even further.</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> The paid MMO is dead. No-one's doing it. The developers who have MMOs in development now tend to say they haven't decided what the business model is \u2013 by which they mean, what flavour of free they're going for. There's still a lot of room for price experimentation in both the mobile and MMO space, and someone's going to find a model that's not just not-intrusive but compelling and also a fun way to pay. </p> <p>Lots of developers are still confused about their route to market. Lots of them have instinctively crass tastes, and the increasing preponderance of booth babes at GamesCom is hardly redressing the public's negative impression of computer games. Making an analogy to politics, developers need to lead the public, like the Indie developers do on Kongregate, iOS and Steam, not follow like the marketing bods do at GamesCom. </p> <p><strong>PG:</strong> To my mind, gamescom 2012 had three main themes. First, there was Vita's viability. Sony needed to show there was a future for the machine. Shuhei Yoshida, PlayStation's development boss, told me it was key he proved there were enough games in the works for Vita to make near-term ownership worthwhile. As such, we saw reveals of some major new first-party Vita projects \u2013 Media Molecule's Tearaway, a fresh Killzone game and others \u2013 and got an exciting Sony press conference. There was a great deal of positivity surrounding Sony and Vita this year, and that's good for everyone.</p> <p>Secondly, we had the show's unavoidable elephant: the next console generation. The main publishers announced no new product, giving us nothing more then fresh-ish demos of E3 software. Development's being pushed wholesale onto next-gen hardware, so there's a huge amount going on behind the scenes that we're not going to see until next year. It made the whole thing a bit stale in terms of blockbusters. Gamescom 2013 will be a very different show, as it's likely the next Xbox and PlayStation will be announced at E3 in Los Angeles next June.</p> <p>Lastly, there was the free-to-play model. Some business journalists were saying they rarely had a meeting about anything else, and it was predicted in the show's main opening ceremony that \"F2P\" would be the dominant method of consuming games within a matter of years. Some of the biggest crowds in the consumer halls were for games which are free to download and are then monetised through micro-transactions, as opposed to being bought for \u20ac50 on a disc. It's very likely this is going to be the future of games in general, and we were seeing the entire subject emerge as a strong theme at gamescom this year.</p> <p><strong>ND:</strong> From a console perspective the biggest story is about what's <em>not</em> here \u2013 next gen is clearly the driving force behind what the big three are doing, including Microsoft and Nintendo not coming because they're not ready to (or in Nintendo's case, bothered about) showing anything new.</p> <p>Next gen loomed large in Sony's conference as well, despite not actually being there \u2013 with Move, Wonderbook and bright, younger-skewing new IP, PlayStation 3 is going kid-friendly for a final profit-squeeze before the end of the cycle, while The Last Of Us looks likely to be its last big hardcore hurrah.</p> <p><strong>KS:</strong> I think on balance then, there's an interesting asynchronous war brewing between the traditional console manufacturers and their old business model, and the emerging free-to-play giants and their platform agnostic mega-brands. If this show really was about the calm before the next generation storm, that coming generation of consoles had better learn from the likes of Trion Worlds and Gameforge. Adaptable delivery and pricing structures are going to be vital. Also, people seem to really like and respond to orginal new titles at these events... whoever saw <em>that</em> coming?</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday lunchtime, Tony Scott drove his car to the Vincent Thomas bridge in the port district of Los Angeles, parked it in the eastbound lane and then leapt to his death in the water below. \"He jumped without hesitation,\" official sources told the press \u2013 and that sounds about right. We shall probably never know what prompted the 68-year-old film-maker \u2013 a Hollywood titan, rich as Croesus and respected by his peers \u2013 to take his own life. But having made the decision, Scott was not the sort to equivocate. In films and in life, the man went at things headlong. He left the doubt and the navel-gazing to the arthouse crowd. He jumped without hesitation.</p> <p>\"I'm more classical and he's rock'n'roll,\" Ridley Scott once remarked of his younger brother, who followed him into the business after training in fine art. \"Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari,\" Ridley told him, knowing Tony's abiding weakness for sleek, streamlined, full-throttle hardware. Scott Jr went on to direct hundreds of TV commercials, helping to bankroll Senior's budding career as a feature film-maker while honing his own style below the radar. He made his feature debut on the lustrous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/84614/hunger\" title=\"\">The Hunger</a> (a rare Tony Scott flop that went on to become a cult favourite) and then hit the jackpot with 1986's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78743/top.gun\" title=\"\">Top Gun</a>, that boisterous salute to the American military and Tom Cruise's dentistry. Top Gun spun its $15m investment into a $350m return. The US Navy set up recruitment booths in the cinemas. Following Top Gun, Scott (born into a working-class North Shields family) could have bought a whole fleet of Ferraris along with his own racetrack to drive them round.</p> <p>His film-making style was a very 80s breed of rock'n'roll: supple, glossy and smart, a reaction to the self-conscious noodling of 70s prog-rock. \"I have a very short attention span,\" he once admitted, proudly claiming that he worked hard to make sure that all of his pictures came in under two hours. By the end of the 20th century, he was arguably the poster boy for populist Hollywood film-making, the master craftsman of the studio system, flogging high-concept thrills with a dizzying panache. He cranked up the volume for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGk2Hr3GcS8\" title=\"\">Days of Thunder</a>, brought down the stadium in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVrsGHs2MCk\" title=\"\">The Last Boy Scout</a> and rode the audience towards armageddon on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjRxdrg9BtU\" title=\"\">Crimson Tide</a>.</p> <p>What films should we remember him for? In terms of global impact, it's hard to see beyond Top Gun \u2013 surely the emblematic picture of the Reagan era; a film that showcased and celebrated a resurgent super-power, back from the mess of Vietnam and comfortable on its throne again. In terms of artistry, though, one is more likely to opt for the dashing Crimson Tide, the electrifying <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34907/enemy.of.the.state\" title=\"\">Enemy of the State</a>, or (especially) the superb <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77113/true-romance\" title=\"\">True Romance</a> \u2013 a flushed, playful and intoxicating road movie, whisked with devilish aplomb out of an early script by Quentin Tarantino. But today, more than any other, I find myself drawn back to his lovely screen debut on his brother's 1962 short <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2010/sep/24/shane-meadows-ridley-scott-early\" title=\"\">Boy and Bicycle</a>. There he is, an everyday teen, grinning at the sky and chewing on his gum as he rattles around the grubby streets of northern England. His incredible, freewheeling adventure is about to begin.</p>",

This had weakened her self-control, although she had the ability to understand her actions and their result. </p> <p>Suspended death sentences are almost always commuted to life imprisonment.</p> <p>Tang Yigan, who is also the court's vice-president, added that the 53-year-old regretted her crime and had also provided information to investigations into other people's crimes. </p> <p>According to his statement, she told the court: \"The judgment is fair. It shows special respect to the law, to reality and to life.\"</p> <p>A family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, was handed a nine-year jail sentence. Tang said it was relatively lenient because the 33-year-old was an accessory rather than the crime's instigator, had confessed and had expressed regret.</p> <p>He Zhengsheng, a lawyer hired by relatives of Heywood to represent them at the hearing, said: \"We respect the sentence from the court.\"</p> <p>He said he had informed the Briton's family of the decision and thanked everyone for their concern.</p> <p>Tang said the court believed Gu poisoned Heywood with cyanide after she and her son, Bo Guagua, had an economic dispute with Heywood in 2011.</p> <p>Its investigation \"confirmed Neil Heywood threatened Bo [Guagua] verbally, making the conflict worse, but [found] no proof he had encroached on Bo [Guagua].\"</p> <p>According to accounts of her trial, Gu's lawyers claimed Heywood had at one point locked Bo Guagua into a home in the UK.</p> <p>Heywood's friends have said they do not believe he would have threatened Bo Guagua and fear he has been smeared to justify a lighter sentence for Gu.</p> <p>The Briton's death last November in south-western Chongqing \u2013 where Gu's husband Bo was then party secretary \u2013 was initially ascribed to excessive alcohol consumption. </p> <p>But the 41-year-old's death ultimately became the biggest political scandal in China for decades, only months ahead of a once-a-decade leadership transition. </p> <p>Authorities said even before Gu's trial began that the evidence against her was irrefutable. But analysts suggest officials have faced a dilemma in sentencing her: too lenient a punishment might suggest that those connected to powerful leaders could literally get away with murder, while too heavy a penalty might be seen as retaliation against the family of a popular official by rivals.</p> <p>\"They didn't kill her. I think this is fair to her,\" said a friend of her family.</p> <p>A witness from the courtroom said Gu looked calm as she heard the sentence and said she was willing to accept education and reform herself.</p> <p>The defendants said they would not appeal. China's courts are controlled by the Communist party and experts say that the outcome of a case as sensitive as this one would have been decided at the highest levels.</p> <p>Suspended death sentences have become more common in recent years, with official sources indicating they exceeded actual death sentences in 2007.</p> <p>Joshua Rosenzweig, an independent human rights scholar in Hong Kong, said one study showed such sentences usually resulted in the criminals serving between 14 and 24 years, with an average of 18 years in prison.</p> <p>Gu might also be eligible for medical parole, but would have to wait two years for her sentence to be commuted and then serve a minimum of seven more years. </p> <p>Attention will turn to the fate of her husband, once tipped for a top leadership position. There has been no comment on Bo's case since the announcement this spring that he was being investigated for disciplinary violations and it is unclear whether he will face criminal charges or simply internal party measures. Some analysts think leaders may wish to wait until after the power transition before dealing with him.</p> <p>Chongqing's former police chief Wang Lijun, who triggered the scandal when he fled to the US consulate in Chengdu after breaking with Bo, is expected to go on trial soon. It remains unclear what charges he will face.</p> <p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the British embassy in Beijing said: \"We welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities have investigated the death of Neil Heywood, and tried those they identified as responsible.</p> <p>\"We consistently made clear to the Chinese authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied.</p> <p>\"Our thoughts are with Mr Heywood's family during this distressing time. Consular officials have attended the trial to fulfil our consular responsibilities to the family and our focus remains on offering them all the support we can.\"</p> <p>In a separate session held immediately after Gu and Zhang were sentenced, four police officers from Chongqing were jailed for covering up the murder. </p> <p>Tang told reporters that the men knew Gu was the prime suspect but \"faked, hid and destroyed\" evidence so she would not face the law, with negative social consequences. Their actions led Heywood's relatives to agree to forego a postmortem.</p> <p>The court heard all four had confessed. Guo Weiguo was sentenced to 11 years as he was the most responsible, while three others were jailed for between five and seven years as they had not destroyed key evidence when Guo asked them to do so. None will appeal.</p>",
  "<p>Lonmin continue to dominate the news from the markets this morning after the mining firm claimed 27% of staff returned to work, although it is not known how many of those are former striking rock drill operators, or others who were unable to get to work because of the violence.</p> <p>The South African-based company, with some brass plates in London, issued a statement late last night revealing it had extended its deadline for striking miners to return to work from Friday to today \"in the light of the tragic events of last Thursday\" which saw 34 workers shot dead by police.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/striking-south-african-miners-face-company-ultimatum\" title=\"\">threats of the sack</a> have done nothing to steady the share price, which dropped for a sixth day in a row, now down 22p, 3.4%, at 617.5p.</p> <p>It follows reports from the weekend that the company was considering an emergency rights issue of $1bn to shore up its cashflow after losing 15,000 platinum ounces of production.

  "<p>Yet again, the voluntary sector proves it's the place to be. Dame Helen Ghosh is preparing to move from one of the most senior jobs in the Civil Service to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/13/dame-helen-ghosh-head-national-trust\" title=\"\">become chief executive of the National Trust</a>. In doing so she will follow in the footsteps of others who have transferred from the public sector, and indeed the private and corporate sector, to the charity world. She'll bring political, policy and leadership skills, as well as a focus on delivery, that would be recognised as invaluable anywhere.</p> <p>It's a shame though that the skills honed by leaders in the voluntary sector are not seen as quite so valuable in the public, and particularly the corporate world; this enriching exchange of skills rarely goes the other way.</p> <p>In a recent programme for senior women leaders from the voluntary sector held at <a href=\"http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Cass Business School</a> and sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newton.co.uk/sites/hub/home/home.html\" title=\"\">Newton Investment Management</a>, we addressed why charity sector leaders are not seen as part of the pipeline for the boards of the FTSE 100.</p> <p>Newton's chief executive, Helena Morrissey, who led the campaign by the <a href=\"http://www.30percentclub.org.uk/\" title=\"\">30% Club</a> to get more women on corporate boards, and has supported Cass' initiative with enthusiasm. She has seen how the skills of the voluntary sector \u2013 including stakeholder management, holding on to an organisation's vision and fundamental purpose in testing times, accounting to many different partners, funders, communities and service users, and in creating a sustainable future through complex strategic planning \u2013 could be applied as much to the corporate world as to the voluntary sector.</p> <p>Lord Davies, who sadly forgot the sector in his report '<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.gov.uk%2Fassets%2Fbiscore%2Fbusiness-law%2Fdocs%2Fw%2F11-745-women-on-boards.pdf&amp;ei=hUwuUImmMYOl0QXHnIHYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTMUSlRwfcfSHQkgK0PJhJEo62OQ&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Women on Boards</a>' (an omission he's now addressed with similar enthusiasm), is also a convert to the skills of the sector. As a result of the programme, so too are many headhunters. So now we want to see whether senior women from the charity sector will really join the pipeline of emerging leaders in the corporate sector.</p> <p>From the programme at Cass and other research by Professor Susan Vinnicombe at <a href=\"http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Cranfield University</a>, we know that women who want to get senior positions need to find mentors and champions, and most of all get the experience that will enable them to be credible and confident at board level in any sector.</p> <p>For those wanting to change sector, particularly from the voluntary to the corporate sector, they need to prepare and think through their careers at an early stage. They need to make choices that will keep options open and not be so committed to practice (important as professional skills are) that they fail to grasp challenges that will broaden their experience and make them stand out early in their career.</p> <p>They also need knowledge of some things that can be learned theoretically or through secondment opportunities, such as the role of independent non-executives, the importance of market sentiment, the importance of shareholder value and the specifics of corporate governance in the private sector. They also have to be able to articulate their existing experience in a way that makes sense to the chairmen (as they nearly all are) of corporate boards and that uses their vocabulary and frame of reference.</p> <p>The research on the Cass programme is not yet finished. I shall be following the initial participants to see how they have considered their own careers and what new opportunities have come to them as a result of the programme. I'll also be learning whether, knowing more about the reality of being on a FTSE board, they think that it really is the place to be.</p> <p>Whatever else we learn, one thing we know already: throughout your career, whether you are a woman or a man, and from whatever sector, think through whether the choices you are making open more doors than they close. It'll help prepare you to make the important career decisions that will create personal flexibility and encourage the exchange of skills so important to our economy and society.</p> <p>No one sector has the answers to all the challenges we face, and we'll all be better off if more people can bring their skills, passion and expertise to all parts of business, public and charitable life.</p> <p><em>Lynne Berry OBE is a senior visiting fellow at </em><a href=\"http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Cass Business School</em></a><em>; deputy chair of the </em><a href=\"http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Canal and River Trust</em></a><em> and was recently named one of the '100 women to watch' for FTSE 100 boards by </em><a href=\"http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Cranfield University</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>I am breaking into my holiday because I can't let a fourth witness statement to the Leveson inquiry by Mazher Mahmood pass without a mention.</p> <p>He has been forced into making a second embarrassing climbdown to the inquiry, which calls into question his long-held claims about the number of people prosecuted due to his News of the World articles. </p> <p>It follows <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/jul/16/mazher-mahmood-sundaytimes\">an internal investigation ordered by Sunday Times editor John Witherow</a>, his current editor, into Mahmood's previous statements to Leveson.</p> <p>He has claimed for some time that he was responsible for more than 250 successful criminal prosecutions, <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-12-December-2011.txt\">testifying to Leveson last December</a> that the exact total was 261.</p> <p>But the Witherow investigation, conducted by the global law firm, Linklaters, managed to discover proof of only 94 prosecutions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Fourth-ws-of-Mazher-Mahmood.pdf\">In his new witness statement,</a> Mahmood explains that Linklaters took strenuous steps to verify the facts through researching press cuttings and making requests to various courts and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).</p> <p>He admits that although he kept \"a broad running check\" on the number of prosecutions he did not maintain records and clippings of every case, \"nor was any proper log or record maintained by the News of the World.\"</p> <p>Mahmood (aka the Fake Sheikh) gives a convoluted explanation for the difference between his original claim and the Linklaters total, and apologises for certain errors. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I provided to Linklaters details of all of the prosecutions which I could recall that predated my first statement. This list exceeded 253 prosecutions, as I believed the number included in my first statement to be a conservative estimate...</p> <p>The details I provided to Linklaters included the following cases:</p> <p><strong>a.</strong> Over 134 different criminal offences committed prior to the date of my first statement and carried out by 94 individuals... </p> <p>I should make clear here that... I would generally count separate charges on which an individual had been convicted on the same occasion as multiple convictions, if they were for what I considered different offences. For example, someone convicted of carrying a firearm who was also convicted for possession of drugs I would count separately.</p> <p><strong>b.</strong> Over 140 illegal immigrants who I believe were deported as a result of my work, although I did not keep a record of their names. My understanding was that an illegal immigrant commits a crime by being present in this country... I now understand from Linklaters that it is unlikely that these individuals would have been the subject of criminal prosecutions per se...</p> <p>That is not something which I was previously aware of, and I apologise for my error...</p> <p><strong>c.</strong> 13 individuals who were barred from their professions or by their relevant sporting bodies, or dismissed by the police or prison service, in connection with allegations of criminal conduct, which were exposed as a result of my work. </p> <p>Again, I understand from Linklaters that such actions do not amount to prosecutions or convictions and so I apologise to the inquiry for including these individuals in my first statement.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mahmood goes on to explain that some courts and the CPS were unwilling to provide the necessary data, adding that he remains \"personally confident\" that his work \"led to substantially more convictions than the 94 individuals which Linklaters has been able to verify independently.\"</p> <p>But his statement has been met with extreme scepticism by Paddy French, the journalist who <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Witness-statement-of-Paddy-French-including-exhibits.pdf\">made a formal complaint to the Leveson inquiry about Mahmood's claims.</a> </p> <p>French, who runs an investigative website called <a href=\"http://www.rebeccatelevision.com/\">Rebecca Television</a>, had conducted a comprehensive search of the News of the World's archive for the 20 years between December 1991, when Mahmood joined the paper, until its closure in July 2011.</p> <p>French alleged in his statement to Leveson that Mahmood \"may have committed perjury\" by overstating the number of successful prosecutions.</p> <p>Now, following the posting of Mahmood's fourth witness statement, French has written to Witherow to say that the Linklaters inquiry findings are closer to his analysis (which found only 70 prosecutions) than Mahmood's 250-plus claim.</p> <p>I have seen a copy of the letter, in which French maintains his position that Mahmood's previous evidence to the committee was questionable. He also says that Rebecca Television is conducting a second piece of investigative work into Mahmood's evidence to Leveson.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for News International confirmed that Mahmood is still employed by the Sunday Times. Asked whether any internal action was being taken against Mahmood and whether Witherow considered his evidence adequate, she said the company had no comment.</p> <p><em><strong>PS:</strong></em> In Mahmood's first witness statement to Leveson, he stated that he left the Sunday Times in 1988 after \"a disagreement.\" I contested that statement and, after being asked by Leveson to provide evidence to support by contention, did so.</p> <p>This led to Mahmood being recalled by the inquiry and conceding that his departure had been due to his having \"acted improperly\". <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-25-January-20121.txt\">Lord Justice Leveson told him he had been disingenuous in his original evidence</a> because he had left the paper after committing an act of dishonesty.</p>",
  "<p>As the summer draws to a close, some of us will still be planning that last-minute getaway. If a member of your family has a learning disability, the chances are you've been planning it for some time. As any parent of a child with special needs will tell you, \"spontaneous\" and \"carefree\" are not words they associate with a holiday.</p> <p>In fact, holidays can be a minefield for some families. Choosing a holiday in the first place is hard. You need to find a venue that is suitable for someone with complex needs. Once you're away, everything is new and unfamiliar, and there are none of the usual support systems you rely on at home.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.netbuddy.org.uk\" title=\"\">Netbuddy</a> has collected the following advice from families of people with learning disabilities. It's a holiday survival guide by people who have been there and earned the T-shirt.</p> <p><strong>Change of routine</strong></p> <p>While most of us relish a break from routine, it can create anxiety and confusion for people with learning disabilities and autism. Without the predictability and structure of a daily schedule, many people with learning disabilities struggle to cope.</p> <p>\"Routines are important in everyone's life,\" says one parent. \"Think about how you feel when you sleep in and miss breakfast. It can make you feel not quite right. That's how my son feels whenever we break his routine.\"</p> <p>Try preparing a holiday routine \u2013 even just a basic structure, like wash, get dressed, breakfast, explore resort, lunch, beach, dinner, bathtime, bed with a story or DVD.</p> <p>Give plenty of notice, explaining what is going to happen the next day and, if possible show photos or postcards of destinations you plan to visit. Make sure there are as few surprises as possible.</p> <p><strong>Sensory overload</strong></p> <p>Many people with learning disabilities have sensory issues, which can cause an over-sensitivity to sights, sounds, tastes, smells and/or touch. This makes some elements in their environment painfully overwhelming \u2013 for example, loud noises, new smells, crowds, bright lights.</p> <p>Holidays can be sensory war zones for people with learning disabilities. Sand, sun, screaming babies, loud discos, crowded coaches, sunburn, melting ice creams \u2026 it can all spell disaster.</p> <p>Do your research. Find out as much as you can about your holiday destination in advance. Know where the quiet zones are and the noise/light/smell hazards \u2013 for example fairgrounds or loud, echoing restaurants with flickering light.</p> <p>Pack a day bag with small sensory objects in it, such as crackly paper, scented bubbles, shiny objects, a small light-up spinning top, magnets, squishy mesh balls, chewy tubes etc. This can help distract when situations become difficult.</p> <p><strong>Unfamiliarity</strong></p> <p>Holidays are all about seeing new sights, trying different foods and doing new things. Many people with learning disabilities and autism get a particular comfort from familiarity. Change can be difficult and holidays may create enormous anxiety in some people, which can lead to challenging behaviour.</p> <p>The key is all in the preparation. Once you've chosen a destination, it's a good idea to start preparing your child as much as possible to reduce the fear of the unknown.</p> <p>Use photos, books and symbols to show every stage of the journey. Collect pictures from the holiday brochure to help your child understand where they're going and what to expect.</p> <p>It may be worth visiting the airport or train station before you go on holiday, to familiarise your child. You could also show pictures and talk about the journey and what happens at each stage \u2013 passport control, baggage check, boarding etc.</p> <p><strong>Sibling battles</strong></p> <p>Most family holidays involve compromise \u2013 juggling everybody's needs so no one gets left out. If your child has learning disabilities, it can be difficult keeping everyone happy. Their needs may take up most of your energy and focus, leaving siblings feeling resentful.</p> <p>Try to make time for activities siblings want to do, even if it's just for an hour or so. They need to feel special and important too. Try taking turns with your partner to do things individually with them.</p> <p>Treat siblings as children, not carers. It can be tempting to rely on them more when you're away, but remember it's their holiday too.</p> <p><strong>Getting lost</strong></p> <p>It's every parent's nightmare \u2013 losing a child on holiday. But when your child or has a learning disability, the problem becomes tenfold. Practice getting lost beforehand. Role play what to do if your child gets lost when you're out and about. Make sure they know how to present their identification card and what to say.</p> <p>Write your contact details, including mobile phone number, on a wristband or attach it to a belt pull or other loop on clothing. If your child has autism, you can get an autism alert card and bracelet from the <a href=\"http://www.autism.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Autistic Society</a>.</p> <p><em>Emma Sterland is manager of the </em><a href=\"http://www.netbuddy.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Netbuddy</em></a><em> website, which offers practical tips on supporting people with learning disabilities </em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>At a recent centenary-year conference on the life and work of the mathematician and logician Alan Turing \u2013 a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI) \u2013 I found myself asking two questions: 1) what, pace The Stones, starts us up and gets us (or any kind of life) going? And 2) why are we always comparing AI and its computational products with human intelligence?</p> <h2>The Switch<br></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.cdpa.co.uk/UoP/Research/members/swade.php\">Doron Swade</a>, former Curator of Computing at the Science Museum, is talking about the Victorian mathematician <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/babbage_charles.shtml\">Charles Babbage</a> and his designs for his proposed mechanical calculators, the Difference and Analytical Engines. Both were unbuilt during the nineteenth century, but <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/I033/10303307.aspx\">Swade finally completed a (very beautiful) working model of a Difference Engine in 2002</a>. He's fascinating on the subject of <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/spiritofplay/music/songs/difference-engine-80713244\">Babbage's correspondence with Byron's daughter, Ada Lovelace</a>, who saw that numbers, as manipulated by the sophisticated Analytical Engine, could be made to represent entities other than quantity \u2013 that the design, in concept, represented the start of a fundamental transition from calculation to computation. Then Swade says something that strikes me as suggestively odd: Babbage's Engine, as the embodiment of mathematical rule, was \"an autonomous construct\".</p> <p>Was it? \"The machine will compel a cycle of operation\", Babbage wrote. But what compels the compulsion? I thought the rule for something being autonomous, like a kind of life, is precisely that it has to self-start. It has to be original in the sense that it has to be more than the result of an imposed discipline. And by those standards, Babbage's beautiful monster, with all its banks of ante-digital data, is no more a self-starting entity than my laptop. Or my toaster. Lovelace called it a \"calculus of the nervous system\", which is a great phrase, but \u2026 you had to <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/I033/10303325.aspx\">pull a lever to get it going</a>. Even now, the mechanical world must be turned on. The cry still goes up: \"Where's the switch?\" Swade is a conference adept, but many of his fellow speakers are having trouble working the lights onstage. Or can't find their way around the desktop. \"Now, I don't quite know what I'm doing here \u2026 where's the file? I thought I moved it \u2026 \"<br> I'm feeling stupidly reassured about all this, when the man in the seat next to me embarks on a terrible coughing fit, a real empurpled horror, with the kind of tense hiatus between grim expectoration and desperate, gurgled apology which has me looking around for a more responsible, perhaps medically trained, bystander. The coughing man is a professor, decorated and retired. When I said I came from the humanities side of things, he said \"Is that code for something?\". I can just see him being wheeled out, packed off in an ambulance. In fact, he recovers and heads for the bar in the interval. But what if he had not?</p> <p>I imagine a nurse picking up the phone to one of his grown-up kids in the middle of the night, and one of them groping for the light, minutes after having made love, and coming to terms with his death, vaguely aware that beginnings and endings are peremptory and undesigned, but held in balance; and all at once it strikes me that we're not self-starting either, are we? You and me. We're not, as individuals, self-organised. Nothing alive is. Something, whether it's sex, or a bolt of lightning, has to get us going. Matter began to twitch billions of years ago, but why did that happen? There's no law of physics saying it has to. Why twitch? Why self-replicate? Why? The leap from the inorganic to the organic \u2013 that's the bullet everyone's trying to dodge. Where's the switch?</p> <h2>Mechanical Art</h2> <p>Here is a common objection to AI. Machines won't be worthy of being considered to be thinking machines until they can write like Shakespeare, or Jane Austen, or even Jodi Picoult. Turing acknowledged this prejudice (The Argument from Consciousness) in his 1950 paper, <a href=\"http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/9\">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>. The question of whether or not a machine can write a sonnet or a symphony, he later added, is not the interesting question. The interesting question is: by whom should such a sonnet or symphony be judged, and how? Turing argued that a machine poem might best be appreciated by another machine, and not by a human being.</p> <p>I think what he was getting at is this: AI is bedevilled by anthropomorphism. But it isn't how well machines can do things, from our point of view, that ought to concern us. We have to wean ourselves off the idea of estimating machine function as a kind of graded, comparative performance, with \"most human-like\" as the prize-winning category. Actually, it's the extent to which we are categorically excluded from whatever it is machines are doing that matters. When they finally speciate \u2013 become different \u2013 a fundamental barrier to mutual comprehensibility will come into existence, in the same way that a species barrier presently exists between dogs and cats or cats and humans. \"I suppose\", Turing said in conversation, \"when it comes to that, we won't really know what they [machines] are thinking.\"</p> <p>It's worth adding, too, that the notion of inter-species inferiority or superiority is ours. It's a category error, and one that has to do with our particular kind of self-consciousness. It may turn out to be lacking in a machine consciousness, which is not bound to carry over into its workings the precisely human operations of the precisely human ego, though that is not to say the machine will be without feelings. It will merely be without our feelings. When machines truly start to think, they will be unthinkably different. That is what we have to try to grasp.</p> <p><strong>Will Eaves discusses his latest novel, This is Paradise, at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival\">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a> on 21 August 2012</strong></p>",
  "<p>A disaster is about to hit the NHS, which I am the first to foresee. It is totally beyond our control. According to Time Magazine, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2121086,00.html\" title=\"\">there is going to be a shortfall of 63,000 doctors</a> \u2013 mostly GPs \u2013 in America by 2015. I ask myself where the Americans are likely to make up this shortfall. The UK of course. So expect a massive exodus from these shores.</p> <p>Why this shortfall is likely to happen is that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will bring healthcare to 32 million Americans, who previously were uninsured. The Association of American Medical Colleges reckons that 63,000 doctors are needed to cope with the extra demand, and that number is going to get higher.</p> <p>To make matters worse, despite the acute need the US federal funding for residential training has been frozen since 1996. There is already a shortage. So, even if they start now, there isn't time to train the 63,000 by 2015.</p> <p>Most of the doctors needed will be GPs. And here lies another problem. Time Magazine says, \"interest in becoming a primary care physician has plummeted; the field's gruelling hours and relatively low pay have given it a second class status\". Currently, students gravitate to more lucrative fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. Last week, I asked whether the doctors, depicted by Bernard Shaw in the Doctor's Dilemma, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/aug/13/have-doctors-changed-since-1906\" title=\"\">had changed their attitudes</a> much since it was written in 1906. It looks as if they may have emigrated, and are alive and well and living in the US! The structure of healthcare, after all, over there has changed much less since the early 1900s, than the UK since the creation of the NHS.</p> <p>So, unless, Mitt Romney and the Republicans are elected in November and throw out Obamacare, as he has promised to do, prepare for mass emigration of our best GPs over the next three years.</p> <p>It is hard to comprehend how so many Americans swallow the Tea Party line on dismissing Obamacare and would rather leave 32 million fellow Americans without any healthcare.</p> <p>The American right has always been perceived as religious. Whatever happened to the Christian virtues of charity and care for the poor and needy? Worse still, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, wants make it even more uncharitable, by dismantling Medicare, the support system for the elderly.</p> <p>Healthcare in America costs twice as much per head of population as in the UK. And despite this extra money, life-expectancy in the US is almost two years lower than in the UK.</p> <p>American doctors are very bright, the better hospitals are possibly more skilled than ours, and \u2013 as I do not tire pointing out \u2013 our NHS is frayed at the edges, but how can anybody justify morally or effectively the pre-Obama system under which their doctors work? That 63,000 extra doctors are needed to provide adequate national coverage is a condemnation in itself.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-healthcare-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

But releasing more government data is a cornerstone of government policy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-potential\" title=\"\">open data white paper</a>, published in June, states: \"From the prime minister down, central government is committed to making open data an effective engine of economic growth, social wellbeing, political accountability and public service improvement.\"</p> <p>How is this being translated across different public services? We asked public leaders how they are tackling the challenges, and reaping the potential benefits, of making more information available.</p> <p><strong>Councillor Nigel Murphy \u2013 Manchester city council; lead member for Digital Manchester and executive member for environment</strong></p> <p>Manchester is embarking on an ambitious challenge to become an open data friendly city. The UK has lagged behind cities such as New York in releasing and promoting its open data, but now we're seeing public sector bodies begin to realise the importance of open data and how it could benefit residents.</p> <p>Manchester city council, like most public bodies, has some of its data openly available, but nowhere near enough. This has been partly due to non-engagement with the digital community about what creative use of apparently dry data can achieve.</p> <p>Now we are talking to the community and working with partners to give them the data they need to help develop useful mobile and web apps and visualisations that will take Manchester up the digital leagues. This is not just about giving the digital playground something to do, but also driving genuine interest from residents.</p> <p>A first <a href=\"http://opendatamanchester.org.uk/tag/hackathon/\" title=\"\">Hackathon</a> organised by the council and its partners is likely to take place later this year, followed by bigger events in 2013. It's vital that this is not a one-off event. With legacy a buzzword around the country at the moment, the same applies to releasing open data and the encouraging the developer community to pick it up, run with it, develop prototypes and then pass the baton, so they can be developed further at the next events.</p> <p><strong>Carole Willis \u2013 chief scientific adviser, Department for Education</strong></p> <p>We published the new-look <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/\" title=\"\">school performance tables </a>in December 2011/January 2012, giving parents more information than ever before about how their child's school is performing. In particular, we added 400% more data about secondary schools than in 2010.</p> <p>In one easily accessible website, the performance tables help parents to compare schools at the same stage of education, providing key information needed to support choice. Parents can find out the school type and size, pupil and staff characteristics, and test and exam results for the main Key Stages. There is also information on school finances, for example, spending on teaching staff.</p> <p>This information, part of the government's drive for greater transparency, can help ensure that schools are held to account for the performance of all their pupils. The site has received more than 7.8m hits since they were first published last December, and we are expecting another peak in the autumn as parents use the site to inform the school admissions process.</p> <p><strong>Simon Parr \u2013 chief constable, Cambridgeshire Constabulary</strong></p> <p>The public has a right to access information about policing in their area and my stance is that we as a service need to be as open and transparent as possible. The challenge comes in organising that data in a way that is easily digestible for the masses.</p> <p>Holding back data protects no one and I would much rather allow the public access to too much information in a disorganised manner, than withhold information and provide the minimum in an organised way.</p> <p>The nature of our work means that things are constantly changing and data collated one month can significantly change the next but it's important we share wherever possible. We have a well-established email scheme, <a href=\"https://www.cambs-police.co.uk/myneighbourhood/ecops/index.asp\" title=\"\">e-cops</a>, where local policing teams keep the public up to date on what is happening in their area.</p> <p>The evolution of social media is also presenting us with opportunities to engage and share information with thousands of people and this is an area I am keen to explore further, as we scratch the surface and discover the opportunities that are out there.</p> <p><strong>Tim Kelsey \u2013 national director for patients and information, NHS Commissioning Board</strong></p> <p>Opening up health and care data is key to improving the outcomes and effectiveness of the NHS. Transparency is the hallmark of a modern, 21st-century citizen-centred health service. It empowers accountability and choice and transforms patient and public participation \u2013 individually and communally. Transparency is a fundamental tool for healthcare professionals to drive clinical quality and research.</p> <p>The NHS is committed to being open and transparent about health and social care data. We publish more data than any other system in the world from cancer profiles for GP practices in England to patient complaints for individual NHS Trusts. This is just the start.</p> <p>There is a lot more data in the pipeline that will be made available over the coming months and years and we are working with a range of organisations to help ensure people have access to the necessary support so they can properly understand the data and make the best use out of it.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that opening up data can have a positive effect in improving our care services, our health outcomes \u2013 and can save money. As one very powerful example of this, <a href=\"http://www.scts.org/about/default.aspx\" title=\"\">the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5935355/Death-rate-among-heart-surgery-patients-is-falling.html\" title=\"\">reported </a>that mortality in coronary artery surgery had fallen by a fifth and in aortic valve replacement surgery by a third over five years, as a result of public reporting of outcomes by individual surgeons. Overall, savings outweighed the costs of data collection more than threefold.</p> <p><strong>Francis Maude - minister for the Cabinet Office</strong></p> <p>This is the most open government in British history and we are leading the world on the transparency agenda. In June I published the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-potential\" title=\"\">open data white paper</a>, explaining how making anonymised public sector data more accessible and more usable will benefit everyone.</p> <p>We agree with the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/transparency-report/\" title=\"\">Commons public accounts committee </a>that open data allows citizens to hold us to account, improve public services, and bolster innovation and growth. Everyone should have access to open data, and that's why we have just overhauled our <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">data.gov.uk </a>site to make it much easier for people to use the data we are releasing.</p> <p>So far, we've published nearly 9,000 datasets across a wide range of areas including transport, crime and justice. Every dataset published is measured against the five-star scheme developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web. The scheme scores the data on how easy it is to understand and use, keeping check on whether we are living up to our promise to make sure that the data provides tangible uses and benefits. Tim is also one of the co-directors for our new Open Data Institute, launching in the autumn, which will ensure we are making the most out of the new data we're publishing.</p> <p>This agenda is here to stay and it's happening across the whole spectrum of government. Departments have published their own open data strategies with a clear timetable of what datasets people can expect to be released and when. The prize at stake \u2013 better public services and a more prosperous UK \u2013 is just too good to ignore.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>We are getting more used to the idea of government consulting the public on the formulation of policy on specific issues, using new technologies and techniques such as crowdsourcing to gather views and suggestions from a wider cross-section of society. The recently published <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.civilservice.gov.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F06%2FCivil-Service-Reform-Plan-acc-final.pdf&amp;ei=pMEsUPylK-mo0AXbpIHYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXnf4GvoJXmRaukPATTYwM14JdCA\" title=\"\">civil service reform plan</a> devotes a whole section to the development of open policy making.</p> <p>The next step in openness and engagement with citizens is giving them the chance to help frame the very laws by which we all live.</p> <p>To open up the legislative process, the government is introducing a 'public reading stage'&#xa0;for bills, to give the public an opportunity to comment on proposed legislation online and have their comments debated at committee stage.</p> <p>The first pilot of this new consultative concept was putting the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-12/protectionoffreedoms.html\" title=\"\">Protection of Freedoms Bill</a> online for comment, clause by clause, last year. This July, the <a href=\"http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Government Digital Service (GDS)</a> launched the second iteration of the public reading stage tool, developed with <a href=\"http://www.helpfultechnology.com/\" title=\"\">Helpful Technology,</a> to allow comments on bills passing through the House of Commons.</p> <p>Welcoming this upgrade, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said: \"This is just the sort of innovative, citizen-focused technology that GDS was set up for \u2013 helping to open a door into the business of government.</p> <p>\"Traditional consultations on legislation have tended to be narrow and exclusive. This online channel makes it easier for ordinary people to scrutinise government plans and put their own ideas, thoughts and concerns into the legislative process and influence parliamentary debate.\"</p> <p>The latest bill to be opened up in this way, providing another opportunity to test the concept and the technology, is the Department of Health's draft <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportbill/\" title=\"\">care and support bill</a> in \"commentable\" form. As DoH head of digital Stephen Hale explained in his official <a href=\"http://hale.dh.gov.uk/2012/06/27/digital-engagement-all-about-people/\" title=\"\">blog,</a> because it comes with \"a public commitment to feed the comments that we receive directly into the process of parliamentary scrutiny via the team working on the bill, we're effectively enabling people to publicly contribute to the drafting of law\".</p> <p>This is certainly a step forward from simply inviting comments \u2013 as is the case with most draft bills, which are published in PDF, with an email address for feedback.</p> <p>While this is going on, there is growing activity at local government level in the use of open data to inform policy development \u2013 and the key aspect, as for central government, is increasing engagement with the public, to get their views and present information in ways that are meaningful and useful to them.</p> <p>Lambeth council, which launched its <a href=\"http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/Services/CouncilDemocracy/DataProtectionFOI/OpenData.htm?sp=opendata\" title=\"\">open data</a> principles earlier this summer, is engaging in online debate with users, and is crowdsourcing its food strategy. Council leader Steve Reed wants to release more and more information, to \"create a closer relationship between users and providers of services\". Because the council holds so much data, it is asking its residents what information they want and in what form.</p> <p>In the north-west of England, the <a href=\"http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/\" title=\"\">Manchester Evening News (MEN)</a> is working with Manchester council to push data and information out to a much wider audience through the online version of the newspaper.&#xa0;The paper wants to put information to work in ways that have direct relevance to local issues. Allowing electors, for example, to compare candidates at council election time, possibly with simple infographics on who they are, where they live respective to the wards they are standing in, and so on.</p> <p>The paper ran a large data project after the 2011 summer riots to provide answers to questions from the community about the reasons behind the disturbances, who was involved and how were they punished. It compiled a database of court cases in the months after the riots and used this information for a front page report.</p> <p>It also used the data to profile the looters and plotted their home addresses against indices of deprivation to demonstrate a correlation between the rioters and high levels of poverty.</p> <p>The MEN has worked closely with <a href=\"http://datagm.org.uk/\" title=\"\">DataGM,</a> a partnership of public sector bodies in Greater Manchester, to find ways of using the data they hold and publish.&#xa0;One example was taking map data for polling stations in the borough of Trafford to encourage readers to vote in the May local elections.</p> <p>The paper has also produced a series of articles based on statistics on the government's crime mapping site <a href=\"http://www.police.uk/\" title=\"\">Police.uk</a> to highlight variations in crime levels across its circulation area.</p> <p>Illustrating that open data knows no geographical boundaries, the MEN reported how a young developer in Germany had produced an interactive guide for commuter travel in Manchester, using data released by the city's transport authorities. He makes the point that while Manchester may not be the first city to publish this information, by making it available under an open licence through DataGM, it was \"really easy for developers to use\".</p> <p>If you want to find out how your local authority is performing on making their data open, and to see what is available, you can check at <a href=\"http://openlylocal.com/\" title=\"\">OpenlyLocal.</a></p> <p><em>Cabinet Office open data team</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

He said an alleged \"FBI investigation\" against his whistleblowing website should be \"dissolved\" and that the US should go back to its original \"revolutionary\" values.</p> <p>\"As WikiLeaks stands under threat, so does the freedom of expression and the health of our societies,\" Assange said, standing on a white balcony just above the pavement, and flanked by Ecuador's yellow, blue and red flag. He added: \"I ask President Obama to do the right thing: the United States must renounce its witch-hunt against WikiLeaks.\"</p> <p>Assange also thanked Ecuador's social democrat president, Rafael Correa, for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-political-asylum-ecuador\" title=\"\">granting him political asylum</a>. Correa's decision, announced last Thursday, has set off a growing international row. Assange also thanked <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/18/julian-assange-case-ecuador-support\" title=\"\">several other Latin American countries for their support</a> \u2013 implicitly warning Britain that any dispute with Ecuador could rapidly snowball into a conflict with the entire region.</p> <p>More than 50 police officers surrounded the embassy in Knightsbridge, south-west London, on Sunday, with a police helicopter in the skies above, but they were clearly under orders not to try to arrest the WikiLeaks founder. Assange addressed around 100 well-wishers, with supporters including Tariq Ali and former British ambassador Craig Murray making speeches from the street.</p> <p>Assange spoke for 10 minutes. He appeared cheerful, if unsurprisingly pale. This was his first public appearance since he slipped into the embassy two months ago and the latest surreal episode in a soap opera that has seen him go from the High Court to house arrest in Norfolk and now to an embassy camp-bed in genteel Kensington and Chelsea, less than 50m from Harrods.</p> <p>The 41-year-old Australian took refuge in the embassy after the supreme court ordered his extradition to Sweden, where he faces allegations of serious sexual misconduct. Assange pointedly did not mention those allegations on Sunday, instead casting his predicament as a universal one of free speech struggling to survive in a \"dangerous and oppressive world\". Britain says it is obliged to implement EU extradition law and will arrest Assange the second he leaves the building.</p> <p>Speaking from the balcony in SW1, Assange claimed that the Met had come close to storming the embassy late last Wednesday. Britain sent a letter to Ecuador last week stating that it believes it is entitled to arrest Assange inside the building under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987. The claim has enraged the government in Quito, which says the 1961 Vienna convention protects its \u2013 and others' \u2013 diplomatic territory.</p> <p>Assange said: \"Inside this embassy in the dark, I could hear teams of police swarming up inside the building through its internal fire escape.\" He said the only reason the UK \"did not throw away the Vienna convention the other night\" was because \"the world is watching\". He also thanked embassy staff, \"who have shown me hospitality and kindness, despite the threats we all received\".</p> <p>Despite the heavy police presence on Sunday, the Foreign Office is clearly trying to find a diplomatic solution to the row with Ecuador. Foreign secretary William Hague has made it clear there is no suggestion that police would \"storm\" the embassy.</p> <p>But Assange's provocative balcony appearance, in which he praised \"courageous Ecuador\" while disparaging Britain, his long-suffering host country, will have won him few new friends in Downing Street. Assange's supporters claim that if he is sent to Sweden he is in danger of being extradited to the US to be charged with espionage. Sweden has vehemently denied this.</p> <p>On Sunday Assange said: \"Will it [the US] return to and reaffirm the revolutionary values it was founded on, or will it lurch off the precipice, dragging us all into a dangerous and oppressive world?\"</p> <p>He said there should be no \"foolish talk\" about prosecuting media organisations, mentioning not only WikiLeaks but also the New York Times, a paper Assange has previously bitterly criticised.</p> <p>He also called on the US to end its \"war on whistleblowers\", and demanded that Bradley Manning, the US army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking information, be released.</p> <p>Manning has been charged with transferring classified data and delivering national defence information to an unauthorised source. He faces up to 52 years in jail.</p> <p>Assange called him a hero and \"an example to all of us\" \u2013 drawing cheers from WikiLeaks fans packing the Knightsbridge pavement. \"On Wednesday, Bradley Manning spent his 815th day of detention without trial,\" Assange said. \"The legal maximum is 120 days.\"</p> <p>Assange also made a rare mention of his children, \"who have been denied their father\". He said he hoped soon to be back with them and the rest of his family, adding: \"Forgive me, we will be reunited soon.\"</p>",

  "<p>The main problem I had with Copper, BBC America's first home-grown drama which debuted Sunday, was something the producers perhaps weren't responsible for: which is, 10 minutes in, I realised that in two separate cases, I couldn't tell one character from another.</p> <p>Either the lighting is too dark and the makeup too uniform, or I have developed a rare dyslexia surrounding men with beards.</p> <p>The show, set in the slum neighbourhood of Five Points in New York at the end of the American civil war, is the kind of period drama that \u2013 even when it's not in a stately home in England \u2013 the BBC does very well.</p> <p>The story revolves around one Kevin \"Corky\" Corcoran, played by Tom Weston-Jones, an Irish immigrant and one of the city's first detectives, and his sidekick, Francis Maguire, played by Kevin Ryan \u2013 who is a completely different person, which you can sometimes tell by the fact he has a glass eye (I think) \u2013 although in profile, it's anyone's guess.</p> <p>Like an unwashed Cagney and Lacey they knock around the city, dispensing rough justice and displaying by turns their rugged and soft sides, and setting up various gentle-burn back stories that will keep us going as the season unfolds.</p> <p>The first episode is slow, but in that luxuriant way one gives historical drama license for \u2013 Deadwood was the same. A guy gets shot through the eye in the first few minutes to establish Copper's commitment to the adult market. Ditto a plotline surrounding a 10-year-old prostitute (who enables the most inadvertently comic line of the show: \"she offered to pleasure me for an egg\"), and then Corky and Maguire are off.</p> <p>There are evil brothel keepers, scheming plutocrats, corrupt city officials. There is a promising subplot involving Dr Freeman, a freed slave played by Ato Essandoh, which feels like genuinely under-explored territory on TV \u2013 the psychological and sociological fallout of emancipation.</p> <p>Freeman and his wife, played by Tessa Thompson, move uptown to what will become Harlem, but in 1864 is still countryside. Every time a white person goes by on a horse, she reaches for the gun.</p> <p>There are the detectives' two bearded bosses, one a police chief, the other a deputy police chief, both in uniform, both quite evil. They could've given one of them a hat or something. And there is the wife of one of the city's richest men, who reminds us that although she is a good deal more clever than her husband, she still doesn't have the right to vote. </p> <p>All of this is very jolly for a Sunday night, like a cross between Gangs of New York and the Forsyte Saga \u2013 with that touch of camp no BBC drama is without. \"Father doesn't want to eradicate the immigrants\", drawls a playboy heir who lost his leg at Gettysburg, \"he simply wants them to move to Hoboken\".</p> <p>The show had two launches in New York this week, one at MOMA, one at the Paley Centre, and very fancy they were \u2013 not the usual BBC fare of a piece of cheese and half a glass of white wine. Money has clearly been spent, not least on Barry Levinson, among the show's executive producers and a sign of the corporation's commitment to breaking into the US TV drama market, although the show could comfortably air in the UK, too.</p> <p>It's hard to put your finger on exactly what this quality is that distinguishes it as a BBC product, but it is definitely there: some combination of high production values, homely faces, and the slightly rickety sense that at any moment a TV aerial will heave into view and not have been caught in the edit.</p> <p>There are some awkward jumps between scenes, and the soundtrack goes a bit Third Class on Titanic when it really gets underway.</p> <p>But Weston-Jones is a powerful lead and an interesting new face (when the lights are on bright enough to distinguish him). The plot lines are slick and the setting is compelling. I think it'll be a fun one.</p>"
