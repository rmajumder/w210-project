  "<h2>Louche Presents \u2026 Leeds</h2> <p>Anyone familiar with monthly Leeds party Louche might be perplexed by the subtitle of tonight's party, The Nothing Special. Their parties are well known as anything but, having brought the likes of Nicolas Jaar, Omar S, Visionquest, Moodymann and Dyed Soundorom to Leeds for some great events. But this tag is not a display of false modesty, it refers to the relatively new music label with which the night's two guests are associated. The Nothing Special was set up by Fabric resident DJ and Saturday night curator Craig Richards \u2013 one of our best selectors \u2013 capable of surprising and entertaining audiences with his skillful programming. Longstanding drum'n'bass DJ Marcus Intalex's interest in club music predates the genre he's best known for, as shown by his recent Detroit-inspired Juan Two Five for The Nothing Special. Here he performs under his new pseudonym Trevino.</p> <p><strong><em>Mint Club, Harrison Street, Sat</em></strong></p> <p><em>Marc Rowlands</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://bit.ly/BLFest2012\" title=\"\">Brick Lane Music Festival</a>, London</h2> <p>Suddenly, the idea of a London-based dance music festival doesn't hold quite the same appeal as it once did. But unlike the fallen Bloc weekender, this one is pretty straightforward: several venues in the Brick Lane locale join forces for the weekend to offer a programme of electronic and dance music, and all they're asking for by way of reimbursement is a small donation to the NSPCC. On Saturday, The Vibe Bar celebrates Mexican independence day with DJ Martitza and a mariachi band; there's hip-hop and bass music in The Big Chill Bar courtesy of DJs from Livin' Proof, Deviation and The Boiler Room; while Caf\u00e9 1001 offers cutting-edge house from Hypercolour's Alex Jones and others, followed by an afterparty in the Old Truman Brewery until 6am. On Sunday, The Vibe Bar ups the irie with David Rodigan, The Heatwave, Loefah and Klose One, while broken beat chap Kutmah and cosmic dubstepper Om Unit occupy the alcoves of Cafe 1001.</p> <p><strong><em>The Big Chill Bar, Cafe 1001, The Old Truman Brewery &amp; Vibe Bar, E1, Sat, Sun</em></strong></p> <p><em>Sam Richards</em></p> <h2>My Heroes Killed Cowboys, Plymouth</h2> <p>West Country folklore states that the devil never dared cross the River Tamar into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a pasty filling. It's not recorded whether a similar, snack-based fate awaits Cornish club promoters heading in the other direction so this show certainly presents a risk for My Heroes Killed Cowboys. They've already presented south west debuts for the likes of Hot Chip, Foamo and the Mystery Jets, and Friday sees them conjure a good-looking freshers' week special. Headliners Jaymo and Andy George have taken their Moda label brand all over the world as well as landing a Radio 1 slot, thanks to their trademark cut-up sound weaving twixt house and weird electronica.</p> <p><strong><em>H20 Bar, The Parade, Fri</em></strong></p> <p><em>John Mitchell</em></p> <h2>Bigfoot's Tea Party, Glasgow</h2> <p>If the name leads you to expect a nice cup of Earl Grey and a dainty cupcake \u2013 or even a rousing speech by Sarah Palin \u2013 you're in for a big disappointment. However, if a tandoori barbeque, vodka jelly and a bevy of Funktion One-fuelled acts are more your cup of \u2013 er \u2013 you know, read on. Following on from the first instalment in July of Bigfoot's annual al fresco outing, part two includes Remain, the co-founder of Paris-based label Meant Records, plus Soma Record's Silicone Soul with support DJs Quail (Animal Farm), Christopher Kelly and Wrick playing across two stages.</p> <p><strong><em>Riverside, Stobcross Road, Sat </em></strong></p> <p><em>Patric Baird</em></p> <h2>The Hydra: Dial Records, London</h2> <p>With its moody music and enigmatically blurred sleeve art, Hamburg's Dial Records is a techno label with the sensibility of a European arthouse film. But that doesn't mean the Dial crew don't know how to party \u2013 check Efdemin's 2007 banger Acid Bells for evidence \u2013 simply that their followers are more likely to wave a Milan Kundera novel than a glo-stick. Headlining this party is Dial's favourite son Panthu Du Prince, whose \"sonic house\" tracks sound as if they're echoing off Alpine peaks.</p> <p><strong><em>Netil House, E8, Sat</em></strong></p> <p><em>Sam Richards</em></p>",
  "<p>A couple of months ago, I collected my elder son from school, as usual. Shouldering his gigantic school bag, we walked companionably along the corridor to collect his younger brother. \"We had horse for lunch today,\" he said brightly, in French. There was a moment's pause&#xa0;as I tried to digest that snippet of&#xa0;information.</p> <p>\"Mmmm. <em>Cheval</em>.\" His face took on a dreamy cast. \"It's so tender. It's my favourite meat. I <em>love</em> horse.\"</p> <p>He rhapsodised for several minutes in this vein.</p> <p>I was obsessed with horses as a child. A city kid, unable to convince my mother our backyard was big enough for a pony, I spent my pocket money on Horse &amp; Pony magazine, hairnets and Polos \"just in case\" there was an unexpected gymkhana in York city centre. I love horse, too. Just not like my boy. The gulf between his childhood and mine was clearer than ever.</p> <p>For the last five years, I have lived in Brussels with my two boys: Th\u00e9o, nine, and Louis, seven. They attend a local Belgian school in a French-speaking area and their friends are all French speakers. This month's school menu doesn't feature horse \u2013 the equines of Belgium can sleep safe in their stables \u2013 but it does include braised endive (less popular than horse) and something called C<em>arbonnade de boeuf aux Sirop de Li\u00e8ge</em> (a kind of stew). We're not in Tower Hamlets any more,&#xa0;Toto.</p> <p>When their French father and I first moved, we thought Brussels would be a good compromise. We had already lived in London (where I felt personally responsible for NHS waiting times, ruinous childcare costs and the Circle line) and in Paris (where I upbraided him, repeatedly, about the officious park keepers, the endless squabbles with our neighbours and the barbed comments I regularly received from passers-by about my post-partum wardrobe). Brussels, we reasoned, was neutral territory, a city where most people were outsiders, where speaking two languages was not merely commonplace, but a national obligation. Our kids would fit right in.</p> <p>In lots of ways, this has been true. Brussels is, indeed, a city of migrants. When Th\u00e9o's class drew their family tree, only one child out of 28 had Belgian nationals for parents and grandparents. When I think of my children's friends, I realise they are all half something, half something else \u2013 Italian, Portuguese, Algerian, Swedish. I love and value that cultural diversity. But my own children? They may be \"half English, half French, half Belgian\" (as they say, with scant regard for basic arithmetic) but, to me, they often seem entirely foreign.</p> <p>The older they get, the more pronounced it is. When they learned to write, I was worse than useless; my \"z\"s were completely wrong, they said, painstakingly copying out something that looked to me like a pelican sitting on a washing line. When they play tag, the one who gets caught isn't \"it\", but \"the cat\", which is plainly ridiculous because when did cats ever display an aptitude for team games? Worse still, when I sent them to school with lime jelly cubes for a special treat one day, they came home mortified, telling me that their friends had called it \"Martian food\".</p> <p>Language is, of course, a big part of that. Bilingualism is a vast and complex topic that I can't hope to cover here, but on a personal level I observe with alarm how far English has fallen from favour, the longer we live in Belgium. My children's mother's tongue is no longer their mother tongue. They speak French to each other, but also to me. I speak to them in English, they reply in French; I tell them to speak English and they refuse in French.</p> <p>With my British friends and family they make an effort, but don't sound native: Louis's sentence structure is right, but he sounds French; Th\u00e9o's accent is pure east London but stilted and he struggles for words. Recently, it took him 20 minutes to remember the word&#xa0;\"wheel\".</p> <p>He got there eventually, but it worried me. I feel responsible for their declining English. I have always been the most devoted Francophile. I was desperate from the first time I picked up French Elle in our school library, aged 14, to replace my culture with a new one that seemed, to my uncritical gaze, to be all about makeup, sex and philosophy.</p> <p>The four weeks I spent, aged 16, with my French exchange student, Aur\u00e9lie, reinforced my determination. Aur\u00e9lie was a model. On the French leg of our exchange, she took me on a photo shoot for a soft-drinks commercial; we rode horses on the beach and went clubbing. In return, my parents took us to a damp self-catering cottage in the Lake District for a week, where we played a lot of card games while Aur\u00e9lie learned that the word \"cagoule\" had a different meaning in English and rowed gloomily around the lake in the drizzle to enhance, she said, her <em>poitrine</em>.</p> <p>Back in York, I tried to make amends by taking her to the Clifton Moor multiplex cinema to see Boyz n the Hood with my friends, who, like me, suddenly looked like spotty, childish losers under the cold scrutiny of Aur\u00e9lie's bored gaze.</p> <p>The die was cast: for me, French was the language of escape, of reinvention. I set about acquiring a French boyfriend as a matter of urgency and spent an embarrassingly large amount of my 20s poncing around pretending to be Parisian \u2013 all Breton tops, Serge Gainsbourg and copies of Lib\u00e9ration.</p> <p>So when my children first started to speak French in preference to English, I was delighted. I found their instinctive understanding of gender, the way they would effortlessly pronounce words that never emerge unmangled from my Anglo-Saxon throat deeply charming and made no effort to force them to speak English.</p> <p>Now, the <em>poulets</em> have come home to roost. They stare witheringly when I get genders wrong. When they do grammar homework, I discreetly check irregular verbs with an online conjugating tool, bookmarked on my laptop. Worse, when I try to tell an English joke, it often falls flat, leaving me to explain, lamely, \"It's a <em>jeu de mots</em>, a play on words.\"</p> <p>It's not just language that is bewildering when your children grow up away from your homeland, it's culture too.</p> <p>The rituals of childhood can take on a whole new complexion in another country: on top of Horsegate, we have struggled recently over whether Christmas presents are brought by a jolly fat man with a white beard or by a tall, robed Greek bishop, with a mitre and crook. The Belgian St Nicholas and his ineffably creepy blacked-up sidekick, P\u00e8re Fouettard (charmingly, Father Whip) are forbidding figures to those unaccustomed to the tradition. Either of them, legend has it, might take exception to your behaviour during the preceding year, put you in a sack and kick you to Spain. Nevertheless, my children accept them unquestioningly. Lost teeth \u2013 are they collected by the tooth fairy or by a mouse? And are Easter eggs the work of a bunny or \"the bells\", which supposedly fly back from Rome to scatter chocolate across Europe? \"But how do the bells carry the chocolate?\" I asked once, grasping to understand.</p> <p>\"They fly upside down, filled with chocolate,\" replied the children's father, flatly, as if it were obvious.</p> <p>\"OK ... But why are the bells in Rome? On a city break?\" I persisted, unconvinced.</p> <p>\"To see ...\" his certainty seemed to sag a little at this point.</p> <p>\"Jesus?\"</p> <p>\"No, the Pope. Anyway, how does the rabbit carry chocolate with those tiny paws?\"</p> <p>\"It has a basket!\" I protested, stung.</p> <p>I love Belgian traditions, their weirdness (for an outsider). I'd rather assimilate than live, like some expats I have met, an entirely British life, insulated from the influences of the country in which they live, buying Shreddies and lemon barley water from an \"English shop\" that looks like a Cotswolds Spar. I do wonder, though, if I should have fought harder for the traditions of my childhood because, increasingly, my boys just want to do what their friends&#xa0;do.</p> <p>Now, perhaps too late, I am trying to redress the balance. I have always read aloud to them in English, but now I devote more time to trying to think which books would most amuse them, turn them on to the language they have all but abandoned. The way they pronounce Roald Dahl may make me weep, but they love the stories. If they want to watch the Simpsons they have to watch in English; and I'm trying to arrange more trips back to the UK, where, desperate to please my father, they will test their rusty language skills.</p> <p>I don't want my children to miss out on the richness of spoken and written English, the cultural oddities of my homeland. I have come to accept my own Englishness and realised what I love about the language: the economy, the pungency, the humour of English. I want to convey that enthusiasm to my kids. Most of all, I want us to find the same things funny: I want them to understand jokes and puns, I want us to watch brilliant British comedy together. CBBC's wonderful <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ncb1z\" title=\"Sorry Ive Got No Head\">Sorry I've Got No Head</a> is a good start.</p> <p>But maybe I'm deluding myself. I look at what I am describing: a lack of shared cultural references, a sense that my children are strangers, their increasing levels of embarrassment at my behaviour and pronouncements. That's the same for any parent, isn't it?</p> <p>All children become aliens sooner or later: you struggle against it, and ultimately lose. Perhaps it's just that bit faster and more obvious for me. Even so, I won't give up until they can tell me what you call a donkey with three legs.*</p> <p><em>* Answer: A wonky, of course.</em></p>",
  "<p>Reggae has been making headlines this summer and we're not just talking about Olly Murs doing the Mobot onstage with Madness at the V Festival (though arguably this is reggae in its purest form). One of the biggest stories of all was the Rastafarian conversion of Snoop from Dogg to Lion, and that is where we will start this month's journey through the genre.</p> <p>Reggae takes on many guises, from dub to dancehall via ska and lovers rock, but Snoop's first reggae release La La La (the results of a visit he made to Jamaica with a film crew from Vice) is somewhat traditional: echoey drum rolls, a roaming bass that leads to the offbeat, a pace so stoned it might as well be buying a 24-pack of KP Choc Dips at the off-licence. The old-fashioned flavour is perhaps surprising given that Snoop chose to work with forward-thinking producers Major Lazer and Dre Skull.

Kartel is currently behind bars awaiting trial on a murder charge, but his proteges seem to be making more than enough noise while he's inside. One of these, Popcaan, is the name on the lips of every dancehall fan right now and it's certainly a name that reflects the music: big, brash crossover hits with a polished sheen. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zCMIS5UmUI\" title=\"\">Only Man She Want</a> is a perfect example of what he does: a clean-cut, bouncing synth line underpinning a catchy singalong refrain that suggests dancehall is moving in a similar poppy direction to that taken by R&amp;B in the States. New single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCe8LuFcopo\" title=\"\">When Mi Party</a> is even more joyous, an anthem that features the stop-start percussion (and yet more synths) of the Summer Wave riddim (a riddim being the backing music that accompanies a song; often a multitude of vocalists will make their own songs from the same riddim).</p> <p>Another of Kartel's proteges is Tommy Lee (sadly not a reggae reincarnation of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce star). I was sent in his direction by Gabriel Myddleton of the Heatwave, a London-based collective responsible for celebrated bashment parties such as Hot Wuk and Mad Raff. Gabriel described Tommy Lee as \"one of the weirdest voices in any genre\" and he wasn't wrong. The key track is Psycho, which is genuinely unsettling, from the masks worn in the video and the slices of minor-key synth to a vocal that swings from earthy rasp to strangulated gremlin. It's close to being comedic but somehow stays on the right side of stomach-churning, at the same time sounding like the complete antithesis of Popcaan's polished chart sound. Just to make things stranger, Tommy Lee has reworked the track as a post-Olympics tribute to his hero \u2026 Usain Bolt.</p> <p>Also gaining the Gabriel seal of approval is UK dancehall star Stylo G, a man who's been championed by Wiley. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOQdnOrIiqQ\" title=\"\">Call Mi A Yardie</a> is still detonating dancefloors despite first emerging last year. Hailing from south London (but born in Kingston, Jamaica), Stylo G's dancehall comes charged with grime's energy, and while Yardie manages to namecheck both Bob Marley and Blackberry in the opening verse, it finds time to voice the opinion that cannabis is a more appealing recreational drug than cocaine. Stylo's new track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8yIqKN2_uc\" title=\"\">Dash Out</a> (featuring Chip, previously Chipmunk) is another club banger, this time distinguished by huge synth rushes kept edgy by Stylo's charged verses.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wI7xDslCJ6I?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wI7xDslCJ6I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wI7xDslCJ6I\">Reading this on mobile?

Sun Araw is a project led by neo-dub explorer Cameron Stallones, and tracks such as Like Wine display a cut'n'paste approach to song-building that should be disorientating but actually ends up feeling giddily playful. You can also check out Stallones's more reggae-orientated side by listening to Icon Give Thank, a collaboration from earlier in the year with reggae legends the Congos. You only have to hear the opening track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzvqlUblncY\" title=\"\">New Binghi</a>, a migraine of electronic squiggles, to get the idea.</p> <p>One final recommendation is the latest from producer Mike \"Prince Fatty\" Pelanconi. Versus The Drunken Gambler is poppy and heavily dub-influenced \u2013 at times there's more echo than Ian McCulloch in the Grand Canyon \u2013 but it's the vocals of singer Hollie Cook that really stand out. The daughter of Sex Pistols drummer Paul, Cook wraps her vocal cords around a couple of reworked tracks: Ol' Dirty Bastard's Got Your Money and a gorgeously downbeat interpretation of the Whispers' 1980 disco hit And The Beat Goes On (for more of this kind of thing, check out Prince Fatty Presents Hollie Cook In Dub). More than merely an album of covers, Versus The Drunken Gambler is actually a fantastical concept album. Plus it's always nice to check your iPod and realise you're listening to a song called Kung Fu Battle Ina Brixton.</p>",
  "<p>\"OK Toyota, here's the pitch for your funny little hybrid car thing: imagine, for a second, that the traffic lights, speed cameras and parking meters inhabiting our city streets are alive and engaged in an endless dialogue.

  "<h2>El-P, On tour</h2> <p>If El-P is worried about being thought of as a \"90s guy\", he's certainly not showing it. Formerly producer and wordsmith for Company Flow \u2013 one of the more vibrant underground hip-hop groups of the time \u2013 on his latest solo album, Cancer For Cure, El-P opens with a triumphal blast of post-Prodigy beatmaking before descending down the demented lyrical wormhole that was a feature of much leftfield 90s rap. These days, however, no one's choosing sides in quite the same way. El-P now keeps company with high-calibre MCs such as Atlanta's own Killer Mike, the hipster-baiting Mr Motherfuckin' eXquire, and the ace in his pack: a diminutive, cardigan-wearing rapper called Despot. The bearded and geeky-looking MC is a witty-yet-aggressive, underrated rhymer and, best of all, he's coming along for these shows.</p> <p><strong><em>The Rainbow Warehouse, Birmingham, Sat; The Fleece, Bristol, Sun; Academy 3, Manchester, Mon; Stereo, Glasgow, Tue</em></strong></p> <p><em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Silver Apples, London &amp; Colchester</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396092325\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347536407902/Silver-Apples-008.jpg\" alt=\"Silver Apples\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">  </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Silver Apples are one of those 60s groups whose influence far outstrips their record sales.

Saxophonist Yuri Honing has representated this tradition honorably for over a decade, performing with stars such as Herbie Hancock and Pat Metheny in the process. In earlier years, Honing conjured some inspired dissections of pop songs by Bj\u00f6rk, Abba and Sting, with a mission statement of testing familiar tunes to quintessence or destruction. The pursuit continues with his new album, True, which includes pop material by Alison Goldfrapp and David Bowie. There's plenty of powerful new original material from this Berlin session, too, and Honing is joined by ECM-label pianist Wolfert Brederode, bassist Ruben Samama, not to mention the saxophonist's regular drummer for many years, the ingenious Joost Lijbaart.</p> <p><strong><em>Pizza Express Jazz Club, W1, Thu</em></strong></p> <p><em>John Fordham</em></p> <h2>Trio Libero, Swansea</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396092328\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347536565101/Trio-Libero-008.jpg\" alt=\"Trio Libero\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trio Libero </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cool swing and bursts of Coltrane-esque atonal jaggedness that have made British saxophonist Andy Sheppard such a distinctive European jazz voice get plenty of elbow room in the supergroup Trio Libero.

The lineup of Sheppard, Polar Bear drummer Seb Rochford (a man with arguably the most distinctive hair in jazz), and French double-bassist Michel Benita slowly coalesced between a 2008 workshop at the Jazz Sous Les Pommiers festival and a gig at last year's Cheltenham Jazz Festival. Rochford can resemble an understated Elvin Jones when Sheppard's in Coltrane-tenor mood, or an abstract-texture percussionist in electronic passages, and can swing intensely without histrionics or high volume. Bassist Benita is conversational, quick-witted, robust and muscular in tone and attack.

I&#xa0;have a nest of them in my stables and they're very happy; I'm very happy with them, too.</p> <p>In simple terms, wasps are an insect predator. They're responsible, along with other insect predators such as spiders, for the maintenance and control of their prey's populations. If you start taking predators out of the system, you get an imbalance, which can be disastrous. The insect population would grow and hammer the plants. The plants then wouldn't reproduce properly, which is bad for ants, which eat and disperse seeds, and then the seeds wouldn't be spread.</p> <p>Wasps are beneficial to humans because they eat a lot of caterpillars and small white larvae that feed on vegetables. They're also part of the bigger picture, the community of animals that we call the ecosystem and that functions only if it has all of the members of that community. We can't be picky and say we don't like wasps but we do like bees. Wasps, rats, cockroaches \u2013 all the creatures we call pests \u2013 play as valuable a role as anything, including us.

In any case, as a paid-up member of the worst kind of food snob fraternity, my answer has always been no. Thank you kindly for asking, but no.</p> <p>But something's afoot.

I know nothing about Garfunkel's, assuming it to be one of those pseudo-US joints that sprung up in the 70s and managed to hang around longer than the likes of Peppermint Park.

I don't know about you, but I find it troubling that one family is behind so many of the UK's mid-range, fast-casual, non-premium offerings.</p> <p>It appears that the consultancy they've drafted in has identified that these days the only way is British. Shelves are accessorised with Marmite, Lyle's black treacle tins and HP Sauce; the union flag bunting is a bit of a giveaway, too. In terms of cool restaurant signifiers, it's not doing that bad a job \u2013 factory lampshades, leatherette booths, that whole kind-of-diner ethic \u2013 but the menu lollops all over the place: pizza, pasta, pies, burgers, fish'n'chips, chicken tikka masala, \"famous\" rotisserie chicken.</p> <p>This is the point where I eat my words and swallow my shallow preconceptions, isn't it? Except, sadly, it isn't: the food is on a short graph with \"meh\"' at one end and \"argh\" at the other. There's prawn cocktail in which I play hunt-the-prawn (there are nine: miserable, flavourless little commas) in a compost heap of browning iceberg and shouty Marie Rose sauce. Calamari come in a stout breadcrumb straitjacket and taste of pork scratchings. Chicken, woolly and tough, is topped with leathery cheese and a BBQ sauce that could weatherproof fences as effectively as creosote and smells not dissimilar. A puck of gristly, mahogany-coloured meat is topped with halitotic onion rings, its scattering of chips peaky, frozen jobs; this burger costs a brave \u00a311.75.</p> <p>And what's that lurking against the wall? Why, it's the famous salad bar, clearly resistant to rebranding, unlimited visits to which can be had for \u00a38.45. After one trip \u2013 I score cold pasta tubes cooked so they're miraculously neither al dente nor floppy; bendy, vinegary coleslaw; \"bacon bits\"; viciously pickled beetroot; and bocconcini of mozzarella with the texture of slugs \u2013 they'd have to pay me to go back.</p> <p>Staff are sweet and try their best. Perhaps nobody told them that mopping around customers isn't the greatest idea, the smell of detergent adding nothing to the limp crunch of coleslaw. They interrupt several times to ask if we're enjoying our meal (we grunt non-commitment; hey, we're Brits), but say nothing as they clear almost untouched plates.</p> <p>According to its literature, Garfunkel's is \"legendary and loved\". By whom? Normally I wouldn't bother with such a place \u2013 filed under Shooting Fish In Barrels \u2013 but since they've spent serious dosh on the rebrand, it's fair to have expected a managerial shufti at the food offering, too. If they can source <a href=\"http://www.aspall.co.uk/vinegar?product=golden-malt-vinegar\" title=\"\">Aspall's golden malt vinegar</a>, they should be able to knock up a prawn cocktail that doesn't taste of stale sweat.</p> <p>It's depressing there are enough people out there prepared to fork out their hard-earned to keep this kind of lowest-common-denominator stuff afloat.

  "<p>Here is a novel which suggests that a place can in some sense manipulate its residents. Saffron Walden in Essex is a commuter town in which old and new are uneasily combined. Rachel Heath nicely conjures up the mix of past and present \u2013 the ancient centre with wealthy young families occupying the larger houses and the less prosperous long-term residents. If you live in Saffron Walden you may wish to check out this book to see where you fit; are you Stella, 22-year-old mother who has&#xa0;always lived in Suffering Boredom, as those of her schoolmates who have escaped call the town? Stella likes it, wants \"just to try and have a normal, quiet life\". Or are you Tacita, restless commuter mother, who is running a blog titled \"Washed Up \u2013 One Woman Swearing at Her Kitchen Sink\", in which she discusses her decision to ignore her husband's adultery?</p> <p>Or are you Jonathan, her slightly manic husband, who is in a perpetual lather about himself and his life? Or Theresa, a breezy, friendly incomer who works at the museum, wears gaudy charity shop clothes and has abandoned a husband with mental health problems? Or Zeki, Stella's Turkish husband, working for a local estate agent, and gullibly drawn into a piece of dodgy practice?</p> <p>Heath's skill is to wind people together, some of them related to one another, others strangers with nothing&#xa0;in common except the place in which they live. Stella is the central character, a girl who has probably rushed too young into motherhood, but is entirely satisfied there. She is thrown together with the brash commuter mothers at \"Paint &amp; Sing\", all of them in search of amusement for toddlers, and is offended by their chatter of skiing holidays, and their patronage. A person who is decent, unassuming and quiet does not lift easily from the page, unfortunately, and in this sense Stella suffers by contrast with the vibrant and unlikeable Tacita, determinedly discontented and obsessed with her ghastly blog.</p> <p>It is the disappearance of Stella's mother, Sheila, that prompts the action, bringing in her sister Joyce and older daughter Marie, a divorc\u00e9e who is a more volatile counterpoint to Stella. And there starts what seems a rather unemphatic police investigation. We hear more from Tacita's husband Jonathan, a febrile fellow, with his lurching self-doubt and vacillating behaviour. Matters come to a head with the curious conjunction of Stella, Theresa and Jonathan going off together, first to a mortuary, then to Southend. This was when my own doubts crept in. This emergency alliance seemed on the face of it unlikely, and would Stella, devoted mother, really have left her tiny unweaned baby for the night?</p> <p><em>Part of the Spell</em> is built on the premise that \"when people do something unexpected or out of character, it proves, in the end, to be the most personal and truthful act of all\". If you subscribe to that, then you will be persuaded by that turn of events, and others. I was not, entirely, though I appreciated Heath's dexterity with narrative.</p> <p>Theresa says \"the problem isn't about who we are, it's who we think we are\". This is a novel about personality, and behaviour \u2013 oh, and Saffron Walden. Much is convincing (Saffron Walden entirely so: I feel I know it). But Stella wobbled, for me, both as a 22-year-old and in her responses to the developing situation. Heath's previous book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/11/rachel-heath-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Finest Type of English Womanhood</em></a>, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/24/costa-prize\" title=\"\">shortlisted for the Costa first novel award</a>. The second novel is notoriously hard to pull off, particularly when the first has attracted attention. <em>Part of the Spell</em> goes a good way towards meeting that challenge.</p> <p>\u2022 Penelope Lively's<em> How It All Began</em> is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "<p>The concept for my book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/sportandleisure/9780718197612/the-nolympics-one-mans-struggle-against-sporting-hysteria\" title=\"\"><em>The Nolympics</em> </a>was, from the publisher's point of view, a risky one \u2013 but it was theirs. It was to have me write up, daily, my experience, as a Londoner, of what it was like to follow the Olympics; moreover, as someone who was not looking forward to them one little bit. The idea, I suppose, was to have the comedy of frustration: in the old, Perelmanian sense of comedy being about getting a man up a tree, throwing rocks at him, and then, finally, getting him down from the tree. I was to be that man, and the Olympics were to be those rocks, and my cries of pain were to be the main substance of the book. \"What if you end up enjoying them?\" I was asked. \"Not terribly likely,\" I replied. \"If I do, then that will be part of the story.\" But the chief riskiness resided, as far as I could see, in the fact that it was me they had asked to do this. I am not known particularly for my industry; and, after all, I have yet to have a book published at all. And I was going to have to work quite hard indeed.</p> <p>Writing a minimum of 1,500 publishable words a day, ideally 2,000, over a 17-day period is not a task that many writers would look to with enthusiasm. Then again, there are quite a few who would regard it as nothing special. On the one hand, you have Trollope knocking off 3,000 words a morning before setting off to work running the Post Office, and Gustave Flaubert writhing on the carpet in agony for hours as to where to place a comma. There is a certain amount of braggadocio involved when writers talk about this \u2013 especially male writers. There is no shame in saying you write slowly. The miracle, it is tacitly understood, is that any of it gets done at all; the speed you do it at isn't really that important, although if you say you write too many words a day, people start wondering if the quality control is strict enough, and if you say you write hardly anything, then people might ask themselves if you're being a bit precious, or how you can afford to feed yourself. For myself, about 1,500 words on the same subject is a day of Stakhanovite labour, to be rewarded by a big, self-administered pat on the back.</p> <p>However, I know that, when pressed, and in the mood, and (I use the word in its loosest sense) inspired, I can write at great speed; it's one of the things that makes life as a hack a bit less difficult than it otherwise has to be. It is also a phenomenon along the lines of how it is sometimes better to run up three flights of stairs rather than walk up them: the body simply doesn't register that it's knackered, the lungs don't start telling you to slow down, until you're nearly at the end. It can be the slow, steady slog that kills and dispirits. And anyway, spread out over a working day, it's not that much: just as when you complain to the doctor that a bottle of wine a night is hardly anything if you're drinking only a glass an hour between six in the evening and midnight.</p> <p>Still, it is alarming, like performing without a safety net, when you realise there is no time daily for anything but the most basic revision. The matter of tone, and its modulation or progress throughout the book, has to be settled on the hoof; a kind of honesty is forced upon the material, so if it seems as though the book starts flippantly but ends more thoughtfully, then that's because that's the way things were going on in my head.</p> <p>By \"thoughtful\", again I mean tone. I do not mean in the careful avoidance of mistakes. Here are a couple towards the end which I will own up to, in order to spare the reviewers a bit of effort: for example, Humphrey Jennings's film was called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gno3mIrh7PM\" title=\"\"><em>London Can Take It</em></a>, not <em>Britain Can Take It</em>; and whatever gremlin inspired me to give The Who's late bassist the first name \"Robert\" when I know perfectly well, and have done since I was 11, that it is \"John\", maybe one day the therapists will be able to nail it down and lay it to rest.</p> <p>As for the Olympics themselves: although I did not go quite as hoopla about them as everyone else seemed to \u2013 or was induced to by peer pressure \u2013 I certainly found myself enjoying the whole spectacle much more than I thought I would. The athletes were gracious in victory, the volunteers wonderful. To clear the air of the toxins that had been building up before was quite something. I also discovered that I am really, really impressed by synchronised swimming.</p> <p>In the end, though, I managed to produce 40,000 words over 17 days \u2013 all the while not neglecting my other jobs \u2013 which is, I suppose, something. (Also a couple of those days were spent travelling to and from Olympic venues and watching things.) There were times when the prospect of working sickened me: but I knew that any shortfall one day would mean it would have to be made up the next. Luckily, the whole phenomenon of the Olympics, and the country's reactions to it, was so interesting that there was never a shortage of material, and I like to think there isn't too much repetition within the book itself.</p> <p>Themes, though, crop up: a recurring one, I discovered, is my fascinated loathing for Boris Johnson, a much more dangerous man than even his enemies seem to acknowledge, and if this book helps in any small way to put a brake on his political career, then I will at least be able to say I have achieved something.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/sportandleisure/9780718197612/the-nolympics-one-mans-struggle-against-sporting-hysteria\" title=\"\"><em>The Nolympics: One Man's Struggle Against Sporting Hysteria</em></a> is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Second World War</strong> by Antony Beevor, read by Sean Barrett (40hrs unabridged, Audible download, \u00a339.98, members \u00a37.98)</p> <p>At last, an epic overview of the second world war that doesn't rinse the blitz, the Battle of Britain and Dunkirk. Reviewers have taken Beevor to task for devoting more than half his latest book to events on the eastern front and Asia. But by doing so, for me at least, he has filled in a lot of hitherto puzzling gaps. I know more or less what happened when and where in the main theatres of war outside Europe. I've read <em>The Balkan Trilogy</em>, <em>The Singapore Grip</em> <em>The Naked and the Dead</em> etc. It's the whys I need \u2013 why the Nazis invaded Serbia, why the Russians supported Chiang Kai-shek, why, after Pearl Harbour, Roosevelt still honoured Churchill's \"Germany first\" priority. In the same clear, compelling prose that we recognise from his previous histories, Beevor methodically assembles the pieces of his vast jigsaw and explains how they fit together.</p> <p>He's a past master of pr\u00e9cis. In a couple of sentences he sums up what others take chapters to analyse \u2013 Hitler's rise to power, for instance: \"The critical mass of the population, desperate for law and order, were eager to follow the most reckless criminal in history. Hitler managed to appeal to their worst instincts \u2013 resentment, intolerance, arrogance and, most dangerous of all, a sense of racial superiority.\" As for the horrific Nazi retreat from Moscow in the winter of 1941, I've read Tolstoy's unforgettable account of the tattered remnants of Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e stumbling home through the snow a century earlier. But for a single snapshot of pure hell, Beevor is unbeatable. German infantry, still wearing the lightweight uniforms they were issued the previous summer, would saw the legs off Russian corpses and heat them over camp fires to remove the boots.</p> <p>After a while, you too become battle-hardened, inured to the cruelty, the slaughter, the casual acceptance of death. Late entries found it tougher. The sight of young, American GIs traumatised by the Ardennes offensive prompted Godfrey Blunden, an Australian war correspondent, to write: \"They were more pitiful because they were only boys, drafted from nice homes in a nice country, knowing nothing about Europe. Not tough like the Australians, or shrewd like the French, or irreducibly stubborn like the English. They just didn't know what it was all about.\"</p> <p>It's a long, gruelling but utterly gripping book, read with the familiar grim resignation Sean Barrett reserves for Beevor's work, but not without the occasional glimpse of black comedy. In adherence to Nazi eugenic law, the registrar officiating at Hitler and Eva Braun's marriage, days before their joint suicide, asked the couple if they were both of pure Arian descent.</p> <p><strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong>, a listener's guide to the myriad versions available to download, ranging from \u00a33 to \u00a325</p> <p>Marriage was Austen's war zone, her opposing forces lined up like second world war battalions. <em>P&amp;P</em> is the book every actress wants to read, hence the embarras de choix. For me, Juliet Stevenson reading Austen unabridged on CD for Naxos takes the gold. But no one under 40 has CDs, they download. Famous busy actresses such as Jenny Agutter, Jane Lapotaire, Joannas Lumley/David settle for pitifully short abridgements (Angela Lansbury's is less than an hour), but beware, they can be dearer than the whole book read by unknowns. I'd recommend Kate Reading and Carolyn Seymour over Lindsay Duncan and Emilia Fox. And Neil Conrich, the only male reader, is good value. Miriam Margolis in a dramatisation makes Mrs Bennet sound like a \"Carry On\" character. The chicklit versions, <em>Mr Darcy's Letter</em> by Abigail Reynolds and <em>Hidden Lust</em> by Mitzi Szereto are fatuous. But <em>Vampire Darcy's Desire</em> by Regina Jeffers, all 18 hours, is a bargain at \u00a317.69, a cross between <em>Twilight</em> and <em>Tristram Shandy</em>.</p>",
  "<p>In the middle of Sebastian Faulks's new novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780091936808/a-possible-life\" title=\"\"><em>A Possible Life</em></a>, at a clinic in Athens in the middle of the 21st century, two Italian brain scientists solve the mystery of human consciousness: \"The thing that had given the world Leonardo, Mozart, Shakespeare and had made humans little lower than the angels, was not an entity, but a connection. It was an open loop that ran between Glockner's Isthmus and the site of episodic memory. It was fragile; it was, in evolutionary terms, very young.\"</p> <p>That this Nobel prize-worthy breakthrough comes as an anti-climax, even to the two women who make it, is surely one reason why Faulks became a writer and not a scientist. The 59-year-old author of a dozen books passionately believes that, even in the 21st century, we need literature as well as science to explain things \u2013 not least ourselves: \"I don't know how you can understand other people or yourself if you haven't read a lot of books,\" he says. \"I just don't think you're equipped to deal with the demands and decisions of life, particularly in your dealings with other people. If I hadn't read all of Jane Austen and DH Lawrence, Tolstoy and Proust, as well as the more fun stuff, I wouldn't know how to break bad news, how to sympathise, how to be a friend or a lover, because I wouldn't have any idea what was going on in anybody else's mind.\"</p> <p><em>A Possible Life</em>, offers up five very different accounts of what it means to be a person. Geoffrey is a prep school teacher, then a spy in wartime France, who is betrayed to the Germans and experiences unimaginable horror shovelling corpses in a death camp. Billy grows up in a Victorian workhouse and makes a go of a life that becomes unexpectedly complicated when his wife recovers from a long illness after he has set up house with her sister. Elena is the lonely neuroscientist who can't quite believe what her own research tells her, and whose childhood memories seem far more pertinent than the shiny new neural pathways revealed by the brain scanner. Jeanne is a poorly educated and pious French family servant in the 1820s, while Anya is a hard-to-resist fantasy \u2013 part sexual, part musical \u2014 of 70s California. But do these five pieces, varying in length from 30 to 100 pages and with only minor circumstantial connections to one another, really add up to a novel?</p> <p>\"I think it's a novel, I'm sure it's a novel because it's conceived as such and because it is unified,\" Faulks replies. \"The novel is a robust form, and you can do anything you like with it. People have stretched it further than this. BS Johnson famously said you could read the chapters of one of his novels [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780330353298/the-unfortunates\" title=\"\"><em>The Unfortunates</em></a>] in any order you like. Lots of people have tried this broken-up-sections thing, so there's nothing really new in it, although it is new for me.\"</p> <p>Faulks says what interests him most in fiction \u2013 more than form, style or plot \u2013 is theme. And there is an overarching theme, he says, that holds <em>A Possible Life</em> together: \"All my books are about one major idea and two or three subsidiary ones. I have thought a lot about music when constructing books and I like the way in music that themes come back. I find that structure appealing \u2013 though I'm not hugely musical and don't want to pretend I am \u2013 so I thought it would be interesting to write a novel with four or five separate movements or parts.</p> <p>\"All the sections of this book are about the same thing. They're about identity and the question of our consciousness, and whether death is a proper termination, and whether we're destined to return in some shape or another.\"</p> <p>Readers looking for answers to these questions will, however, be disappointed. Faulks's title to the central section, about the scientist Elena Duranti, \"Everything Can Be Explained\", could hardly be more ironic. On the contrary, as the story wraps up in 2069 with the character sinking into her giant sofa in her futuristic Turin apartment with a glass of wine, he writes: \"Elena admits that after a lifetime of scientific research she understands nothing at all.\"</p> <p>Among novelists, as he is quick to acknowledge, Faulks occupies a privileged position. \"I always thought I would have to have a day job,\" he says with a laugh and a rap on the wood of the coffee table in the London hotel where we are talking. \"When I started out, it wasn't thought you could make a living out of serious or literary fiction unless you got lucky with some big prize.\" A former journalist who took voluntary redundancy in his late 30s, Faulks has achieved a level of commercial success that must make him a target of envy at many literary gatherings. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099387916/birdsong\" title=\"\"><em>Birdsong</em></a>, the novel he wrote straight after switching to writing full-time, published in 1993 when he was 40, has sold more than 3m copies.</p> <p>Sales figures, often an awkward subject with authors who claim not to know the numbers, trip off his tongue and form part of our conversation. So I learn that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/romance/9780099394310/charlotte-gray\" title=\"\"><em>Charlotte Gray</em></a>, his second world war novel which was made into a film starring Cate Blanchett, has sold more than 1m copies. <em>Human Traces</em>, his own favourite among his books and a dense 800 pages of fictionalised history of psychiatry, has sold half a million \u2013 five times more than his well-received James Bond continuation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9780718153762/devil-may-care\" title=\"\"><em>Devil May Care</em></a>.</p> <p>Next year <em>Birdsong</em>, which was televised this year by the BBC with a screenplay by Abi Morgan, will have its 20th anniversary. Ignored when it came out by the literary prize judges but now studied at A level and one of the outstanding word-of-mouth successes of its decade (<em>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</em> was another), this is the book that defined Faulks's subsequent career. \"It was a wonderful thing for me, a completely wonderful thing. And if when I die people say 'that was his big book', then fine. I don't think it's the best book I've written, but to use an analogy, if you have a train with several coaches then it's no bad thing to have a locomotive. <em>Birdsong</em> has pushed or pulled my other books along with it and it is a book that I'm proud of.\"</p> <p>The novel describes in visceral detail the experience of trench warfare, including the carnage of the battle of the Somme, and juxtaposes the physical agonies of battle with the sensual delight of a passionate love affair that took place in the same part of France a few years before. Faulks has explained, most recently to the Guardian book club, how the whole era seemed \"remote, repulsive and badly memorialised\" when he decided to write about it: his own interest was piqued when he was asked to read out a list of old boys killed in the war at a Remembrance Day school assembly, and subsequently lost his voice, a symptom he attributes to shock.</p> <p>He was not the only author drawn to the first world war as living memories of it began to fade. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/book-club-regeneration-pat-barker\" title=\"\">Pat Barker's <em>Regeneration</em></a>, the first in a trilogy of war novels, was published two years before <em>Birdsong</em>. The two authors share an agent in Gillon Aitken, but Aitken (having sold Barker's book to Penguin, and Faulks's to Random House) didn't mention the coincidence: Faulks says the first he heard of Barker's book was when he made a trip to the old military hospital at Craiglockhart, where Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen were treated, and somebody there told him about it.</p> <p>When Faulks finally met Barker at the Cheltenham festival, \"she said a funny thing: 'people think we must be like Coe and Ovett, but I'm delighted [for you].' Actually I think it was mutually helpful. It's like that thing with Italian restaurants. If you have one on a street and another one opens it can be good for business.\"</p> <p>Faulks dines out on the tale of how, when he told his editor he was going to write a first world war novel, she was appalled, and clearly enjoys the irony. Since then he has been further emboldened by success to follow his instincts, however far they appear to diverge from trade wisdom. He has written six novels since <em>Birdsong</em> (including <em>A Possible Life</em>), with interruptions along the way for assorted projects such as an admired triple biography, <em>The Fatal Englishman</em>, a book of pastiches pulled together from his days as a radio quiz team captain, and most recently the BBC television series and accompanying book <em>Faulks on Fiction</em>.</p> <p>Faulks grew up in Newbury, Berkshire, the younger of two sons. His father was a solicitor, his mother worked for the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden. When he was 10 she had a breakdown, and although she got better, the experience of psychic disarray made a powerful impression. Mental illness is one of Faulks's central themes, most notably in <em>Human Traces</em>, and he has had periods of acute unhappiness himself, starting during his adolescence at Wellington College and continuing into his student years at Cambridge, fictionalised to stark effect in his unusual 1970s murder mystery <em>Engleby</em>.</p> <p>After university he found a comfortable berth for himself writing features for the Sunday Telegraph, and then moved to the Independent where he met his wife Veronica, with whom he has three children. They live in a house in west London. His elder brother Edward is a Tory peer and a QC, while his sister-in-law is a Conservative councillor. His own politics are harder to pin down. His 2009 state-of-the-nation satire, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099458289/a-week-in-december\" title=\"\"><em>A Week in December</em></a>, combines an energetic assault on the venality of hedge fund managers with a swipe at comprehensive education. It also includes strong criticism of Islamic religious teachings, which Faulks amplified when he described the Qu'ran to a newspaper as \"the depressive rantings of a schizophrenic\" with \"no ethical dimension\". He later issued an apology.</p> <p>\"The things that make anyone want to be a writer, in your teens when you first get fired up, are always going to be liberal feelings. You're always going to be on the side of the underdog, the individual who is being crushed. Think of the books you read \u2013 <em>Jane Eyre</em>, <em>David Copperfield</em>, George Orwell. I've by and large had liberal instincts but that's about as far as I could define myself politically.\"</p> <p>But whatever his private preoccupations, Faulks is always mindful of the reader. He is a good plotter who works hard at making it difficult to put his books down: the climactic scene of <em>Birdsong</em>, in which Stephen Wraysford is trapped underground for several days in a tunnel and emerges in a German trench to find the armistice has been signed, provides a cathartic release towards the close of a novel that was always going to struggle to find a happy ending.</p> <p>For all its horror \u2013 and Faulks deserves credit for popularising rage at the catastrophe of the western front \u2013 war offers an abundance of life-or-death moments that readers cannot help but find exciting, even as they are regretting the appalling waste of life.</p> <p>Faulks's father survived the evacuation of Dunkirk, fought in north Africa&#xa0;and Italy and ended the second world war a major. Faulks himself thinks \"most people would be interested to find out\" how they would have coped had history placed them in the firing line. \"I think at the age of 18 I'd have been OK, at 25 I was such a bundle of neuroses that I probably wouldn't have been, at 40 I'd have been OK again. But I do think the generation that fought the second world war was very remarkable, both the men and the women. And I don't think my generation could have done such a good job. That may sound a bit sentimental, but you still sometimes see these guys talking \u2013 there was a thing about Bomber Command on television the other day, and they were just so great.\"</p> <p>His novels tend to come with generous helpings of sex, though he firmly rejects the idea that there's a valid distinction between fiction that is erotic (good) and pornographic (bad). He cut a graphic scene out of his Bond book in favour of the Flemingesque \"he tore her dress roughly and \u2026\". \"I don't think you should be trying to arouse the reader,\" he says. \"You have to ask yourself, do they need to know?\"</p> <p>In 1998 he won the Literary Review's Bad Sex award for <em>Charlotte Gray</em> \u2013 and was so annoyed that he became the first winner not to turn up to the ceremony. But this didn't put him off, and the 1970s California section of his new novel offers explicit details of lovemaking because, in the narrator's words, \"what was communicated through sex was more than a coupling; it was the powerhouse of everything between us.\"</p> <p>He cites Penelope Fitzgerald along with Alan Hollinghurst and Martin Amis as novelists whose work he admires, but Fitzgerald didn't appear on the list of 28 books featured in <em>Faulks on Fiction</em>. Neither did other women writers, including George Eliot and Virginia Woolf, leading some critics to complain that his version of English literature was too narrow and too male.</p> <p>Faulks says the whole TV experience was \"bruising, very boring\". Filming was dogged by bad weather, and the BBC lost confidence in the whole concept of a books programme at several points along the way. No surprise, then, that the final product lacked a convincing argument and over-emphasised one of Faulks's bugbears at the time: the modern propensity to imagine that fictional characters must be based on real people (Faulks had recently fallen victim to a bout of such speculation when rumours circulated that one of the characters in <em>A Week in December</em> was modelled on the writer and critic DJ Taylor).</p> <p>His next project will be another crack at the state-of-the-nation book he feels he didn't quite nail before: \"I really do want to write about this world again. <em>A Week in December</em> ended up being heavily satirical, and humorous, I think, but I didn't set out to write it like that. I wanted to write a much more straightforward, realistic book.\"</p> <p>Readers should be warned that his may be a snapshot of the 21st century in which the digital dimension is missing: Faulks believes his three children's lives have been \"blighted by electronic media\" and could hardly be more scathing in his assessment of Facebook (\"nonsense\") and Twitter (\"just ridiculous, the tweets one reads quoted in newspapers are beneath fatuous\").</p> <p>Whether he can match the pitch and seriousness of <em>Birdsong</em> in a novel set in the 21st century or satisfy his own ambition to do \"something more in the line of Roth or Bellow or Updike\" remains to be seen. But there's no doubt that he will do his best to entertain as well as inform his readers: \"I think there is a transaction. I've always tried to ask quite a lot of the reader, but if you're going to ask a lot then you have to give quite a lot back. It is a contract, a deal. I've probably read 12,000 books, I've written 12, and you know as a reader the point at which you say 'you're not really giving me enough here'. Reading a book is an investment of money if you buy it and certainly of time, and I think you have to honour that.</p> <p>\"My ideal relationship with the reader is that at certain points they will have said 'I'm finding this quite tough but I'm going to hang in there', then at the end they will say 'oh God, I'm glad I hung on, it was so worth it'.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 September 2012. The original referred to Faulks as a former radio quiz host rather than team captain, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p><em>Zoo Time</em> is Howard Jacobson's first novel since his Man Booker winner, <em>The Finkler Question</em>, and he is dividing opinion as always. According to <strong>Anthony Cummins</strong> in the Spectator, the new novel \"is a satire on modern literary publishing seen through the eyes of a writer, Guy, who wants to sleep with his mother-in-law \u2026 Things happen in it not to feed the story but to feed punchlines \u2026 Overstatement is key to Jacobson's style, as if he might become a comic writer simply by being a writer you can't take seriously \u2026 The problem with satire, as distinct from broader varieties of comedy, is that it only survives so much exaggeration \u2026 A red rag, or just bull?\" For <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9509242/Zoo-Time-by-Howard-Jacobson-review.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Alexei Sayle</strong> in the Daily Telegraph</a>, \"Jacobson's writing is both hilarious and angry\".

  "<p>The sight of Alexa Chung focusing her bright turquoise toy camera on the Chanel catwalk last year was proof, if any were needed, that the Diana+ is the camera <em>du jour</em>. Lightweight, colourful and cheaper than a handbag, with limited editions designed by the likes of Paul Smith or the White Stripes, they have an obvious appeal to the teenagers you see cooing over the range at Urban Outfitters or at the Lomography shop in trendy Spitalfields Market. But they are also cool enough for Hoxton hipsters intent on exploring the low-fi aesthetic of analogue photography.</p> <p>Serious photographers tend to prefer the Holga: it's a bit bigger than the 35mm Diana+, but uses medium-format film, which is relatively hard to come by and expensive to process. Both have fixed lenses and only one shutter speed, but they can produce all sorts of startling effects.</p> <p>Anything goes in the Lomo approach to film photography, the website <a href=\"http://www.lomography.com/\" title=\"\">Lomography.com</a> assures us, even \"boring, brou-ha, left toes, blurred nothings\".</p> <p>Hmmm. Some of us would rather not waste \u00a31 a shot developing rubbish snaps, which is why we have come to Brighton for a half-day \"Holga and Diana\" workshop at Create Studios.</p> <p>\"Lomos are flaky cameras,\" says tutor James Kendall, cheerfully. \"That's part of the appeal: they're like those friends who never show up at parties but when they do, the party's always a blast. When your Lomo pictures go right, you get incredible results.\"</p> <p>And people all around the world are getting those great results: among the thousands of images posted on the <a href=\"http://www.lomography.com/photos\" title=\"\">Lomography.com</a> gallery are many dazzling results, from gorgeously saturated colour to faded images straight from a 1950s magazine. There are optical distortions, weird lighting, blurry silhouettes, superhero skin tones, and ghostly overprinting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396141233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/12/1347448834786/Lomography-portrait-in-Br-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lomography portrait in Brighton\" width=\"460\" height=\"449\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lomography portrait in Brighton </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Big-name \"Lomo amigos\" include actor Elijah Wood, musician Jack White and fantasy writer Neil Gaiman, attracted by a low-fi aesthetic and the possibilities of \"happy accident\".</p> <p>First, a little history. The first Lomo camera, the LC-A, was a cheap 35mm compact with a rather good fixed lens. It was first made in Russia in the 1980s, and introduced to the west by some enterprising Austrian students a decade or so later. Lomography.com still sells LC-As (now mostly made in China) but they're not cheap; it also has a range of more affordable and even more low-fi alternatives.</p> <p>The Holga, which we are using, is all plastic and, although relatively large, weighs next to nothing. The Diana+ is based on a toy camera from the 1960s. Then there is the funkiest-looking of all, La Sardina, made, as the name suggests, from recycled tin. All are are prone to light leaks, which, in Lomography, is a good thing.</p> <p>Now for the theory. There are only two modes, James tells us \u2013 sunny and cloudy \u2013 so you shouldn't even think of trying to take pictures indoors without a flash. Outside, look for shadows \u2013 if you can't see any, go read a book or something.</p> <p>He produces little cards for us to use to calculate distances for accurate focusing, and demonstrates how to balance your camera on a folding wooden measure at exactly the right distance for close-ups. I make a mental note to concentrate on the middle distance instead. Make sure you wind the camera on after you've taken your shot, he tells us. You may want to consider throwing away the lens cap, too \u2013 so you won't forget to take it off.</p> <p>Forewarned, we head out into Brighton. It's a drizzly Saturday \u2013 not much in the way of shadows \u2013 so there's a challenge to start with. But Create Studios is ideally placed for locations. The immediate vicinity is grungy urban: great graffiti, scruffy industrial buildings, lots of rubbish, odd patches of flowers. But it's only a few streets away from the warren of fiercely independent shops that is the Lanes. There's much to catch the eye here \u2013 mosaics in the pavement, windows full of hats, a knitted Brighton pavilion, transvestites in killer heels and men in tiger suits arguing at market stalls.</p> <p>James, who edits <a href=\"http://brightonsource.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Source</em></a>, a local listings magazine, is a good guide, offering a running commentary on the sights along with tips for good pictures. \"Go for old-fashioned shots,\" he suggests, to go with the old-fashioned technology. Crowds are easy, dogs even better. \"Do shoot into the sun \u2013 you get good effects that way.\" Not an option that afternoon, sadly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396141234\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/12/1347448939512/Anne-Maries-shot-in-Pavil-001.jpg\" alt=\"Anne-Marie's shot in Pavilion Gardens\" width=\"460\" height=\"469\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Anne-Marie's shots in the Pavilion gardens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Marie Conway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is something hugely liberating about going out with a group of photographers. In the ordinary way, I'd never get down on my knees before a bunch of green plastic ducks. Or hold a piece of string to a girl's nose to make sure she is in shot (actually, I let James do that \u2013 I planned to capture the moment for posterity). In the gardens around the Pavilion, we poke our cameras into a bush to capture a man practising some yogic discipline in his shorts, and squat to focus as hen-partiers in top-to-toe union flags strike poses for us.</p> <p>By the time we reach the beach, the rain has driven everyone away from the merry-go-rounds and damp deckchairs. Once we've used up our two free rolls of 120 film (a couple of dozen pics in all), it's time to go our separate ways. I buy some more film, in hope that the weather will improve. If my borrowed camera hadn't jammed as I was on my way back to the Grand, I just know I'd have got some brilliant night images of the pier and the streams of traffic below my hotel room balcony. For the next couple of weeks, I see great Lomo shots everywhere. I don't want to give the Holga back. Maybe I'll splash out on an LC-A. Then I get my prints back. Almost every bloody shot is overexposed, fuzzy, and with lots of unintentional camera shake. Even the ducks. (I know \u2013 James did warn us. Yes, I should have taken up the offer of his folding rule.) Maybe I won't bother with an LC-A. I'm told there are lots of smartphone apps that can give you the same effects \u2026</p> <p><em>\u2022 The course was provided by Create Studios in Brighton (01273 601965, </em><a href=\"http://welovecreate.com\" title=\"\"><em>welovecreate.com</em></a><em>).

  "<p>Eddie Grapper is the Sherpa Tenzing of the O2. He's a mountaineer and climber and he's got the beard to prove it. He used to work in advertising but tired of coming up with pithy straplines and decided to devote the rest of his life to craggy peaks, perilous ledges \u2013 and managing Up at the O2.</p> <p>\"I'll be honest,\" I tell him, staring upwards, \"all I know about climbing is based on watching Touching the Void and reading The Ascent of Rum Doodle. And in both cases, climbing does not end well.\"</p> <p>Eddie nods sagely. \"Well,\" he proffers, \"we've all climbed the wrong mountain.\"</p> <p>I stare up towards the vastness of the O2. Am I about to climb the \"wrong mountain\"?</p> <p>Up at the O2 opened this summer. It's a continuous walkway that takes you over the roof of the old Millennium Dome. The highest I've ever dared climb was a four-foot stepladder and that ended in tears.</p> <p>\"Climbing,\" Eddie tells me, \"is about the intangible and the ineffable. It's about a connection with your environment. You need a spirit of adventure.\"</p> <p>\"I've got that,\" I chip in.</p> <p>\"A willingness to explore new things.\"</p> <p>\"Check.\"</p> <p>\"You need to want to see what the world looks like from the top of something.\"</p> <p>\"Ummm.\"</p> <p>\"And you need a tremendous amount of physical strength.\"</p> <p>I blink. \"Eddie,\" I confess, \"I have the upper body strength of a daddy-longlegs. And I hate heights.\"</p> <p>He stares back at me. \"We got a wheelchair up there this morning. We get everyone up and over, whatever their fitness level. I've had pensioners in their 80s do it. You'll be fine.\"</p> <p>This challenge isn't quite what I've been expecting. I've spent the past few days fretting as to how I am going to grapple my way up the side of a building, but the setup is ingenious. I'm kitted into a jumpsuit, snapped into a safety harness and then, after a short climb up a perfectly normal set of stairs, find myself at base camp, the starting point of the climb.</p> <p>\"Vertigo can kick in,\" I'm told. \"But trust in your safety harness. The worst that can happen to you is that you fall to your knees. And you will always be the same distance above the roof. That can be a comfort.\"</p> <p>I stare upwards. The walkway is like a stretched, ridged trampoline with a wire running up its centre. It's very steep but the good news is that after the first 20m, the walkway gradually flattens out in increments until you hit the centre. All the same, the emotion I'm feeling isn't comfort. It's more gnarled terror mixed with the fear of a suddenly loose bowel.</p> <p>I'm clipped onto the wire and told that I must, at all times, keep one hand on my safety clip. It has to remain in the \"smiley face\" position in order for me to move and, from the off, I find this quite tricky, mostly because all I want to do is hold on to the central wire with both hands and make noises like a wounded goose.</p> <p>However, the fact I have to concentrate so hard on maintaining the smiley face clip position means I have no time to think about how I am shimmying up the side of a very large building and before I know it, I've reached the first peak.</p> <p>\"Don't forget to look around,\" says our guide, Tom, who is lovely.</p> <p>I can't quite do that yet but I'm determined to conquer my revolting fear of heights and, at some point, take both hands off the wire and the clip and do a proper Chris Bonington hands-on-hips grin.</p> <p>The climb, I'm discovering, is more akin to a fairly strenuous walk. The early upwards sections are tough on the calves, but the higher we go, the easier it becomes. There's a certain amount of bounce to the walkway that takes a little getting used to and I wish I'd worn a slightly sturdier shoe, but as we approach the summit, dare I say it, I am actually enjoying myself.</p> <p>There's a large observation deck at the top and I am overwhelmed with a sense of achievement. \"I have climbed atop,\" I cry. \"I have stood aloft and I can declare I was here!\"</p> <p>\"Yes, you can,\" says Tom, smiling.</p> <p>I have conquered the grand peak of the O2 and if I can do it, so can you.

  "<p>Having spent half a week in Port Isaac, on Cornwall's north coast, in a tiny <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrustcottages.co.uk/cottage/the-birdcage-011084/\" title=\"\">National Trust cottage called The Birdcage</a>, we find The Old Coastguard quite a contrast. Not only do we no longer have to duck to pass through a doorway, but the sun's out for the first time all week, making Cornwall seem a whole lot jollier. We check in at a glassy reception area off the main bar, then head through a sunny lounge with yellow and green walls and floor-to -ceiling windows to a sun terrace dotted with white-clothed tables. There's a lovely lawn lightly forested with palm trees, where couples and families drink and play. At the end of the garden a little door opens onto a pebbly beach, where a resident seal likes to surprise swimmers.</p> <p>I can see why the new owners Charles and Edmund Inkin jumped at the chance to take on this place. It used to be, by all accounts, a rather stiff and dowdy Victorian hotel, with a fantastic position in one of Cornwall's quaintest fishing villages. Now the brothers have added this to their portfolio of foodie boltholes, which includes <a href=\"http://www.felinfachgriffin.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Felin Fach Griffin</a> near the Brecon Beacons, and the <a href=\"http://www.gurnardshead.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gurnard's Head</a>, between St Ives and Zennor.</p> <p>Both are renowned for good food. The Gurnard's is almost booked out year round \u2013 unheard of for a coastal hotel. Now the Inkins just have to polish up The Old Coastguard. Renovations have been on hold over the summer, and will be done \"a bit at a time\". Guests will have to suffer the bad carpets and wallpaper in the corridors a while longer, though the lounge and dining areas, already done, feel fun, in seasidey colours.</p> <p>At first we're unsure whether our room's one that's been done or one that hasn't. It's the former \u2013 the Roberts radio and tongue-and-groove headboard should've been a giveaway, but I'm not keen on the mustardy-yellow wall paint also favoured at the Gurnard's. Wouldn't pale grey be more contemporary? Maybe I've read too much <em>Elle Deco</em>. But the white en suite is spic and span, the window full of the spectacular blue sea, and only the boyfriend cares that there is no TV, as he'll miss the cycling.</p> <p>There are fresh flowers and some great furniture downstairs: benches and pews from auctions and vintage fairs. We scour the menu while drinking pink champagne on the lawn, and all my doubts about staycations drain away. Inside, our table for two has seats side by side, looking out to sea.</p> <p>What the hotel has got right, from the off, is the food. (\"That was the priority,\" says Charles.) Orange segments accompanying light salt-cod croquettes (\u00a36.50) bring a refreshing sweetness; whole lemon sole with brown butter (\u00a312) is glassy-fleshed and delicate; and roast chicken (\u00a310.25), which shouldn't really tempt so close to the sea, hides irresistibly juicy meat under a thin crisp skin. Mousehole has a few good restaurants now, but I'd wager this is the best, and a bargain too.</p>",
  "<p>So much for the hope that Super League's play-off series would start with a rousing contest on the field to draw attention from the embarrassing attendance. Wigan shrugged aside a bitterly disappointing Catalans challenge to move to within 80 minutes of next month's Old Trafford Grand Final and will now enjoy the luxury of a bye through the second round of the play-offs next weekend.</p> <p>The Catalans will have a second chance with home advantage in Perpignan as their reward for finishing in the top four of the table but, if they come through that, they can expect to be summoned back to Wigan, who will now have the right to choose their opponents in the qualifying semi-finals under the controversial Club Call innovation.</p> <p>Wigan seemed vulnerable after losing Gareth Hock to an unspecified injury and Michael McIlorum with a three-match suspension as a result of their home defeat by St Helens in the last league game of the season. Brett Finch, their Australian schemer in chief, also seemed to be hobbling on a heavily strapped left thigh but that did not stop him seizing control of the game early on.</p> <p>One perfect long pass on to the chest of George Carmont allowed the veteran Samoan centre to score the game's first try in the fifth minute and, after Pat Richards had curled over a superb conversion, Finch sucked Scott Dureau out of position to combine with Liam Farrell and send Carmont clear for his second.</p> <p>When Thomas Leuluai brushed aside a weak attempted tackle from Greg Mounis, Wigan had a comfortable 16-0 lead inside 24 minutes. The Catalans did respond with a well-worked try from Louis Anderson but it was quickly cancelled out by Darrell Goulding's simple finish to leave them trailing 22-6 at half-time.</p> <p>They never threatened a comeback after that, with Farrell bursting over for Wigan's fifth try early in the second half and then Sam Tomkins scoring from Matty Smith's accurate kick. Wigan's coach, Shaun Wane, was able to remove Tomkins when he took a bang to the knee soon after that, with an eye to greater challenges ahead. The second half was turgid and tedious for a neutral, although Wigan maintained their concentration impressively, denying the Catalans any further chances and adding a couple more tries of their own \u2013 a third for Carmont and a long-range spectacular for Josh Charnley, which brought the loudest cheer of an instantly forgettable night.</p> <p>However, that will not worry the Warriors. This was a thoroughly professional performance that re-establishes them as favourites to reach Old Trafford, even if they may yet be underdogs when they get there. The wider game can only hope for a bit more spice from the remaining three play-offs, starting with a Warrington-St Helens derby on Saturday night.</p> <p><strong>Wigan Warriors</strong> Tomkins; Charnley, Goulding, Carmont, Richards; Finch, Leuluai; Lauaki, O'Loughlin (capt), Mossop, Hansen, Hughes, Farrell. <strong>Interchange</strong> Lima, Dudson, Flower, Smith.</p> <p><strong>Catalan Dragons</strong> Greenshields; Blanch, Sa, Duport, Millard; Bosc, Dureau; Paea, Henderson, Casty (capt), Menzies, Anderson, Baitieri. <strong>Interchange</strong> Mounis, Raguin, Pelissier, Fakir.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> R Silverwood (Mirfield).</p>",
  "<p>In 1902, the caustic American satirist <a href=\"http://www.ambrosebierce.org/\" title=\"\">Ambrose Bierce</a> \u2013 who once reviewed a book by observing that its covers were \"too far apart\" \u2013 proposed a&#xa0;new social convention. Modern life, he complained, involved being introduced to far too many people: you'd meet a friend in the street, then a friend of <em>his </em>would stroll by, and before you knew it you'd have a new, unasked-for acquaintance, with all the obligations that entailed. Bierce blamed the democratic spirit of the 20th century: in the older, more formal days, stricter rules governed who could form acquaintanceships with whom. \"It is to be wished,\" Bierce wrote, \"that some great social force, say a billionaire, would set up a system of disintroductions.\" He imagined a generous gent, a&#xa0;Mr White, resolving to disintroduce two friends of his, Mr Black and Mr Green. \"Mr Black,\" he might say, \"knowing the low esteem in which you&#xa0;hold each other, I have the honour to disintroduce you from Mr Green.\" Mr Black (bowing): \"Sir, I have long desired your unacquaintance.\" Mr Green: \"Charmed to unmeet you, sir.\" Mr White: \"I'm sure you will become very good strangers.\"</p> <p>It's probably best, for Bierce's sake, that he never lived to see <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=15610312130\" title=\"\">Facebook's People You May Know.</a> Ever since the widespread adoption of email in the 1990s, in fact, the phenomenon he bemoaned has reached a scale he could never have imagined. Technology exposes us to vastly more opportunities for making social connections, and far more effortlessly than even a stroll down the street and a handshake. Yet an etiquette for terminating those links, should they outlive their mutual benefit \u2013 if they ever had any \u2013 remains as absent as ever. Even \"unfriending\" someone on Facebook, the closest equivalent to Bierce's proposal, feels like delivering a slap in the face (and not even a well-timed slap, since you can't be sure when they'll find out). Facebook itself hates unfriending, for commercial reasons, and thus makes it easy to hide updates from tiresome contacts without their knowing \u2013 a deeply unsatisfactory arrangement that leaves you at constant risk of meeting someone face-to-face who assumes you must already know they've got engaged, or had another baby, or been dumped, or fired, or widowed.</p> <p>The result \u2013 at least for anyone who can still recall friendship before the social media age \u2013 can be an awkward hodgepodge. There are Facebook friends with whom you want to share everything, those you've grown apart from, and those you've barely heard of. (You can assign them to different lists, but then you've introduced a whole new layer of decisions: who belongs where? What qualifies someone to be switched from one list to another? And so on.) There are Twitter followers with whom your acquaintance is strictly professional, those you know from school, but didn't necessarily like, and those who are your dad. Not long ago, I realised, with a feeling of dismay, that I'd started to think of some of these contacts \u2013 not most of them, but some \u2013 as clutter.</p> <p>If that sounds a heartless way to think about other people, consider the parallels. Physical clutter, as a widespread problem, is only as old as modern consumerism: before the availability of cheap gadgets, clothes and self-assembly furniture, it wasn't an option for most people to accumulate basements full of unwanted exercise bikes, games consoles or broken Ikea bookshelves. We think we want this stuff, but, once it becomes clutter, it exerts a subtle psychological tug. It weighs us down. The notion of purging it begins to strike as us appealing, and dumping all the crap into bin bags feels like a liberation. \"Friend clutter\", likewise, accumulates because it's effortless to accumulate it: before the internet, the only bonds you'd retain were the ones you actively cultivated, by travel or letter-writing or phone calls, or those with the handful of people you saw every day. Friend clutter exerts a similar psychological pull. The difference, as Bierce understood, comes with the decluttering part: exercise bikes and PlayStations don't get offended when you get rid of them. People do. So we let the clutter accumulate.</p> <p>Or most of us do. Last year, a writer of romance novels from Illinois named <a href=\"http://arlynnpresser.com/\" title=\"\">ArLynn Presser</a> embarked upon what you might call an audit of her so-called friends \u2013 the social equivalent of picking up each old gadget and scrutinising it, before keeping it or throwing it out. She was recently divorced, and her adult children had left home \u2013 \"If your kids don't call you a lot, that's a&#xa0;sign you've done a good job,\" she told me \u2013 and she was spending hours every day on Facebook. \"I was keeping up with everybody's news, noticing what they were doing, staying up to date, and I&#xa0;began to think, 'Seriously though, who <em>are </em>these people? If&#xa0;I was in college with you, and we weren't particularly good friends then \u2013 why are you suddenly someone I message back and forth with at least once a day?'\" Politeness, she knew, was the reason she'd accepted some of her online friends: \"Say someone sends a request and you look at your mutual friends and you wonder, 'Wait \u2013 were you the person I was talking to at that wedding?' You don't want to ask, 'How, exactly, do I know you, and why would I want to be your friend?'\" Presser had 325 Facebook friends, a little money stashed away, and a fear of flying that she wanted to overcome, so she decided to combine all three: she made a New Year's resolution to visit them all, to find out why \u2013 or, indeed, whether \u2013 they were friends.</p> <p>\"I don't think I realised,\" Presser says, \"that it was going to be quite as big a deal as it was.\"</p> <p>To recognise that friend clutter is a problem, it should be emphasised, doesn't mean condemning online friendship per se. It's commonplace, these days, to encounter the concern that social media might be making us lonelier \u2013 that online bonds can't be as fulfilling as \"real-life\" ones. The sociologist Sherry Turkle, author of the recent book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780465010219\" title=\"\">Alone Together</a>, worries that \"we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection. Email, Twitter, Facebook, all of these have their places\u2026 but no matter how valuable, they do not substitute for conversation.\" One frequently cited statistic, based on research among Americans, is that between 1985 and 2004 the number of people who said they didn't have a single \"confidant\" \u2013 someone to whom they could talk about anything \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30038995?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101038109423\" title=\"\">rose from 10% to 25%</a>. A further 20% had only one such person. It might seem hard to avoid the conclusion that all the time we spend online, superficially connected but in a more profound sense isolated, must be to blame.</p> <p>Except that, according to an ever-growing body of evidence, social media <em>isn't</em> making us lonelier or less deeply connected. Instead, study after study endorses the idea of \"media multiplexity\": people who communicate lots via one medium, it&#xa0;turns out, are the kind of people who communicate lots via others as well. <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2006/The-Strength-of-Internet-Ties/01-Summary-of-Findings.aspx\" title=\"\">Regular emailers are more likely also to be regular telephoners</a>, one study found; people who use Facebook multiple times a day, according to another investigation, have <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Technology-and-social-networks/Part-3/SNS-users.aspx\" title=\"\">9% more close ties in their overall social network, on average, than those who don't</a>. Social media builds social capital, rather than degrading it: regular users of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, one major survey last year concluded, <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Technology-and-social-networks/Summary.aspx\" title=\"\">are 43% more likely to vote</a>. Even that chilling statistic about more Americans lacking a confidant now looks dubious: a new analysis by the sociologist <a href=\"http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.3/claude_s_fischer_loneliness_facebook.php\" title=\"\">Claude&#xa0;Fischer</a> <a href=\"http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/america-is-not-getting-lonlier/\" title=\"\">concluded that the finding arose because of a change in how the questions were asked</a>. There's little other evidence to suggest that more people are feeling lonelier. Which makes it tricky to maintain that the new modes of friendship are&#xa0;eroding friendship itself.</p> <p>None of this means that friendship isn't being transformed by social media, though. It's just that the problems aren't those of isolation \u2013 of the replacement of face\u2011to\u2011face contact with screen-gazing in darkened rooms \u2013 but those of scale. The anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar famously calculated \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/14/my-bright-idea-robin-dunbar\" title=\"\">Dunbar's number</a>\" \u2013 the notion that the largest number of meaningful social relationships that any one person can maintain is somewhere around 150. Before the internet, we kept things manageable by natural attrition: if there were people you didn't want to see any more, then by and large you didn't see them. \"It's unnatural for us to drag all our past relationships with us into our future, as we do with Facebook,\" says Anjali Mullany, social media editor of <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/\" title=\"\">Fast Company</a> and writer of its \"social media agony aunt\" column. \"That's not how things have worked, in terms of friendship, for thousands of years.\"</p> <p>Online networks have a tendency to obliterate the nuances between different kinds of relationships. Despite Facebook's lists, privacy settings and the rest, Mullany points out, \"ultimately, somebody is either your friend on Facebook or they're not. In real life, we're very political about our friendships, and I don't mean that in a bad way.\" There are friendships we'll let fade to nothing; others for which we'll put on a&#xa0;facade for a few hours at Christmas; or friendships of necessity, where we'll give the impression of intimacy without the reality. In contrast, \"Facebook essentially doesn't allow us to be political.\" Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, makes no secret of his belief that everybody sharing everything with everybody else would be Facebook's ideal state. (The site's more nuanced levels of user control are provided, his statements imply, only as a grudging concession to old\u2011fashioned attitudes that will soon die out.) It's no coincidence, of course, that maximal sharing means maximally lucrative opportunities for advertising. But this flattening of relationships is unlike anything we've called \"friendship\" before.</p> <p>When Presser set out to meet her Facebook friends, one of the first things she discovered was that about two dozen of them had no intention of letting her visit, which certainly answered the question of what kind of friends they were. More revelations were in store. Some people proved overly demanding, such as the woman with whom she'd grown up and who had moved to a&#xa0;remote part of Turkey \u2013 she said Presser could visit so long as she brought her a Mac computer and a printer. When Presser offered to help her have the equipment shipped instead, she says, she found herself unfriended. Then there was the childhood acquaintance with whom, Presser realised, she'd stayed Facebook friends mainly to&#xa0;avoid giving the impression that she had a&#xa0;problem with his having undergone gender reassignment surgery to become a&#xa0;woman. But when they met, they still didn't get along: \"I&#xa0;didn't like her any more than I had done as a&#xa0;child.\" Another Facebook friend, whom she visited in Boston, seemed friendly enough: they went to a yoga class together and said warm goodbyes at the airport. Waiting for her flight, Presser blogged about the yoga class in a slightly facetious manner. \"By the time I got off the plane,\" she recalls, \"I'd been defriended and blocked.\"</p> <p>Presser is at pains to point out that her expedition, which she plans to use as the basis for a&#xa0;book, was a largely positive experience. In a&#xa0;remote corner of Alaska, she rekindled an old friendship; near Beachy Head, she was served a&#xa0;splendid Sunday dinner by people she'd never met; again and again, she was moved by the generosity of people \"who, after all, hadn't signed up to my resolution\". But her year of friend\u2011auditing was clarifying, too. The realisation that she didn't have much in common with certain Facebook \"friends\" meant they no longer needed to weigh on her mind; she could focus on the other ones instead.</p> <p>Not that it would be accurate to give the impression that Presser reduced her number of Facebook friends. Mentally, she had decluttered. But thanks to the publicity her quest attracted in the US media \u2013 and her seeming inability to decline new requests \u2013 her friend count stands at 5,000. Facebook won't let her add more.</p> <p>The more profound truth behind friend clutter may be that, as a general rule, we don't handle endings well. \"Our culture seems to applaud the spirit, promise and gumption of beginnings,\" writes the sociologist <a href=\"http://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/faculty-detail/?fc=440&amp;flt=l&amp;sub=all\" title=\"\">Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot</a> in her absorbing new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Exit-Endings-That-Free-Lawrence-Lightfoot/dp/B008LXBEG2/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347362178&amp;sr=1-2-catcorr\" title=\"\">Exit: The Endings That Set Us Free</a>, whereas \"our exits are often ignored or invisible\". We celebrate the new \u2013 marriages, homes, work projects \u2013 but \"there is little appreciation or applause when we decide (or it is decided for us) that it's time to move on\". We need \"a language for leave-taking\", Lawrence-Lightfoot argues, and not just for funerals. A&#xa0;terminated friendship, after all, needn't necessarily signal a horrifying defeat, to be expunged from memory. One might just as easily think of it as \"completed\".</p> <p>Mullany recommends a friend-decluttering exercise that she admits sounds \"weird\", but that she predicts will become more and more widely accepted. She advises making a public proclamation on Facebook in which you specify the criteria by which you'll henceforth be defining people as \"friends\". Maybe you'll resolve only to remain Facebook friends with people you've met at least once in real life, or maybe you'll use a&#xa0;stricter standard, such as whether you'd invite that person to your wedding. Explain, in the same proclamation, that the consequent defriending shouldn't be taken personally, and that you're doing it to a number of people at once. Then start clearing out the clutter. Increasingly, Mullany argues, social media will force us to evaluate our friendships in this way \u2013 to take stock of our connections, so as to reserve our energies for those who matter most. She equates this to drawing up the guest list for a wedding: \"It's stressful but, for many people, making that list is a really important, meaningful moment.\"</p> <p>A person involved in the music industry whom I'll call Andrew \u2013 because telling you his real identity would defeat all his efforts to manage his online presence \u2013 recalls the moment he realised he'd need two Twitter profiles: one for his public existence and one for his actual friends. (The problem is somewhat different on Twitter, since followers don't need to be approved.) \"You forget that there's an audience,\" he says. \"I'd be saying something to a friend, and then someone I&#xa0;didn't know would chip in, furiously angry about what I'd&#xa0;said. I thought, 'I can't be fucking bothered with this.' It was like dragging a&#xa0;busload of people behind you wherever you went.\" Andrew left Facebook for similar reasons. \"Somebody I'd been at school with when I was 10 sent me a message to say, 'Are you still really into Adam And The Ants?' Of course I'm not. I'm in my 40s, and we knew each other when we were 10.\"</p> <p>If Zuckerberg's insistence that everyone should be friends with everyone prompts us, out of necessity, to winnow our lists to a smaller group of people we truly cherish, he'll have done something admirable, even if it's the opposite of what he intended.</p> <p>And what of Bierce, who was longing for a new convention of disintroductions as long ago as 1902? He handled his own exits unconventionally, to say the least. In 1913, at the age of 71, he took off for Mexico, telling friends he wanted to witness the revolution underway there. Some time later, he is supposed to have written, in a letter to a&#xa0;friend, \"I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination\", though the letter has never been found. Then he vanished. There were rumours \u2013 one involved his execution by a Mexican firing squad \u2013 but nothing was ever confirmed. Gradually, it began to dawn on Bierce's friends that, one way or another, he'd disintroduced himself from them all.</p>",
  "<p>Nasa's Dawn probe has now left Vesta, its ion thrusters accelerating it gently towards the dwarf planet Ceres. It was back on the first day of the 19th century that Ceres became the first object to be discovered in what we now know as the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</p> <p>That something was orbiting in that gap was suspected because of a numerical curiosity noticed a few years before. Known as the Titius-Bode Law, it begins with the sequence 0, 3, 6, 12 etc, where each number after the 3 is double its predecessor Add 4 to each and divide by 10 to arrive at 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.6, 2.8, 5.2, 10.0, etc. To within 5% or so, these correspond with the distances of the known planets at the time when expressed in astronomical units (AU), the unit of the Earth's average distance from the Sun. Mars sits at almost 1.6AU and Jupiter at 5.2AU, but nothing was known at 2.8AU. Belief in the law was boosted, though, when Uranus was discovered in 1781 very close to the next-predicted distance of 19.6AU.</p> <p>Ceres fitted the 2.8AU slot almost exactly and when other bodies began to be found at similar distances the idea grew that these are the debris from a single shattered planet. We now realise that Jupiter's powerful gravity has never allowed the material there to coalesce into a single object. Whether the Titius-Bode Law is anything more than a coincidence is still debated, but its prediction of 38.8AU fails for the outermost planet, Neptune, which orbits at close to 30AU.</p>",
  "<p>Northampton's Ben Foden faces a race against time to feature in England's autumn Tests after suffering a nasty-looking ankle injury in the second half of a heavy-duty Premiership contest. Though the unbeaten Saints have collected their third successive win of the new campaign, they now face an anxious wait to discover if Foden has done significant damage to his right ankle.</p> <p>Foden was hurt in the 46th minute when he was clattered by a charging tackle by the Bath winger Tom Biggs as he attempted to flick a quick pass away. Northampton were in control of the game at the time but had to endure a nervous finale as Olly Barkley chipped steadily away at the healthy lead established by his opposite number, Stephen Myler, who kicked five penalties.</p> <p>There was much for the watching England head coach, Stuart Lancaster, and his attacking skills lieutenant, Mike Catt, to ponder, not all of it positive. Some of the Bath backlines of old involving Catt would have made better use of the first-half possession won by their forwards, despite a fast start to the game.</p> <p>Only 70 seconds had elapsed when Nick Abendanon opened the scoring, racing on to Biggs's chip from what looked a narrowly offside position near the left touchline. The home side were fortunate the score was not referred \"upstairs\" for ratification, another example of the hit-and-miss nature of the current IRB trial system.</p> <p>Three neatly struck Myler penalties had regained the lead for the Saints by the start of the second quarter as Bath's early confidence began to give way to frustration at the referee's no-nonsense attitude.</p> <p>Northampton also began to exert genuine pressure up front, even in the absence of their injured Springbok prop Brian Mujati. By the time Myler drilled a fourth successive kick straight through the middle to extend his side's interval lead to 12-8 it was clearer still that Bath needed to find another gear. Barkley saw an attempted penalty rebound off the upright in the final action of the first half and the hosts' inability to launch the dangerous Kyle Redmond into space was another disappointment.</p> <p>Bath also had to replace their captain, Stuart Hooper, and were guilty of kicking the ball away too often, with Michael Claassens and Barkley both guilty of making life easier for the opposition. While Abendanon looked as dangerous as any runner on the field, try-scoring chances were scarce in a relentlessly physical encounter. Myler and Barkley both narrowly missed penalties which could have settled the outcome but the Saints' forwards finished strongly and a 76th-minute drop-goal by Tom May gave the visitors slightly more breathing space. A last-gasp flurry from Bath raised local hopes but Barkley's chip ahead rolled tantalisingly over the dead-ball line, allowing Northampton to add to their previous successes over Gloucester and Exeter.

  "<p>\"The problem of growth is that we have a very serious shortage of demand,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/09/vince-cable-rebuffs-conservatives-deregulation\" title=\"\">said Vince Cable last Sunday</a>, asserting a Keynesian reading of the slump that events are vindicating. He went on to denounce ideologues who seek a solution in cutting what they call red tape \u2013 and the rest of us consider rights at work.</p> <p>\"It's nothing to do with those supply side measures,\" he said. Five days is a long time in politics, however, and on Friday the same business secretary signalled that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/14/unfair-dismissal-compensation-cap-cut1\" title=\"\">the maximum compensation</a> for unfair dismissal would be slashed.</p> <p>So what was he thinking? Of course, regulations must balance what is fair and what's affordable, but cutting the cap will do precious little about costs, since most awards are an order of magnitude less. Cable himself says that Britain's existing regulations are perfectly compatible with \"very flexible labour markets\", which have stopped employment falling as fast as the economy.</p> <p>But he is cutting compensation \u2013 just as he previously barred recent recruits from getting any \u2013 purely to placate the deep right-wing prejudices reflected in the evidence-free <a href=\"http://news.bis.gov.uk/imagelibrary/downloadmedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=5551\" title=\"\">Beecroft report</a>.</p> <p>Cable's defence is that he rejected Beecroft's plan to allow bosses to fire when there is no fault, but that was hardly a difficult call. <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/beecroft-report-letting-us-sack-staff-we-dont-like-will-be-good-for-the-economy-bosses-tell-downing-street-7770808.html\" title=\"\">Adrian Beecroft himself had conceded</a> that his plans would have the \"sad\" consequence that \"people would be dismissed simply because their employer did not like them\".</p> <p>The proper response to this dross was not compromise \u2013 but to leave workplace rights well alone.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine it was your son or daughter, your brother or sister, your mother or father. They arrive home from hospital and in their bag you discover a Do Not Resuscitate notification. You would be horrified, with good justification \u2013 especially if you had visited their bedside daily yet held no discussions about the imposition of such an order, as demanded by the law. Instead, medics played God and decided, without consultation, that the life of your relative is worthless and they can die in an emergency.</p> <p>This sounds a shocking scenario. Sadly, it is all too common for people with profound disabilities. The latest case <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/13/downs-patient-hospital-dnr-order\" title=\"\">involves a man with Down's syndrome in a Margate hospital</a>. It is,&#xa0;as&#xa0;his lawyer says, blatant discrimination \u2013 yet it is happening in hospitals around the country, where doctors take&#xa0;a look at&#xa0;people with learning difficulties and make myopic assumptions about their&#xa0;quality of life. Astonishingly in this day and age, they&#xa0;often conclude it is kinder to let them die than live.</p> <p>Over the last five years the mental health charity <a href=\"http://www.mencap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mencap</a> has collated close to 100 cases of people with disabilities dying in hospitals when their lives could have been saved. The charity believes this is just the tip of the iceberg. Campaigners reel off stories of families bullied into allowing Do Not Resuscitate orders to be imposed or whose wishes were simply ignored. Parents and carers tell of the need to protect their children and charges when in the supposed sanctuary of hospital. .</p> <p>After 18 years of caring for a child with profound and multiple disabilities, my family has learned that hospital is to be avoided if possible. We have witnessed countless examples of blinkered behaviour: the doctor who ignores the patient, the GP told an injection could be fatal who gives it to her anyway, the nurse told the patient is blind who asks if she would like to watch a video. Despite life-threatening epilepsy my daughter was ignored for six hours when taken in with a fractured skull \u2013 and for nine hours when in near-constant seizure.</p> <p>Carers know patients unable to talk can be left unfed or thirsty, despite often-greater needs. One friend was rung up to be told her profoundly disabled daughter's airways had collapsed, yet doctors left her dying until her mother arrived half an hour later and demanded treatment. Minutes later and this little girl would have been one more example of death by indifference.</p> <p>Doctors and nurses are not bad people, of course. Far from it. They think they are doing their best in often challenging circumstances. Unfortunately, too often they come to misguided conclusions about the quality of life of profoundly disabled people and the love felt for them by their families. So they will take aside parents of a patient bought in with a chest infection and ask what they really want done \u2013 in effect saying shall we allow your child to die like a sick animal, rather than understanding that people find pleasures in all different ways.</p> <p>Some institutions are grappling with these issues. The best palliative care teams know there need to be months, even years, of difficult discussions over resuscitation notices. But ultimately prejudice and institutional discrimination in the NHS reflect attitudes towards disability that&#xa0;stain our society \u2013 especially towards people with the most complex needs.</p> <p>For all the genuine pleasure over the&#xa0;Paralympics, disabled people remain&#xa0;second-class citizens when it comes to jobs, transport, housing, education \u2013 and health. The epic exploits of Ellie Simmonds and David Weir will not change social exclusion. When even doctors display prejudice, it is little wonder that some scapegoat those with learning difficulties and we witness rising levels of hate crime.</p> <p>Until society comes to terms with disability, accepting that even those with the most profound conditions can enjoy fulfilling lives and are loved by their families, hospitals will remain dangerous places and doctors will condemn people with learning difficulties to death.</p>",
  "<p>The US government will slash spending targeted for the protection of embassies around the world as part of a $100bn program of automatic spending cuts set to be start this January if Congress can not find a compromise.</p> <p>The news comes after ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans died following attacks the US consulate and a safe house refuge in Benghazi on Tuesday night. US embassies across the Muslim world are now being targeted by protesters angered by a video that denigrated the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>According to a 400-page White House report released on Friday, automatic spending cuts to be made at the end of the year will include $129m a year earmarked for the next nine years to go to maintaining and protecting US embassies.</p> <p>The cuts are a small part of massive cuts to the military, air traffic control, the federal bureau of investigation, housing and social welfare programs, government salaries and private contracts that \"would have a devastating impact on important defence and nondefence programs\", according to the report from the White House budget office. Starting in January, some $54.7bn per year will be cut from defence spending and continuing for nine years.</p> <p>The report details cuts for 1,200 separate budget line items. The White House said the spending cuts would total $984bn, and the government would spend $216bn less in interest payments on the federal debt. Salaries for military personnel and Medicare benefits are exempt, but the cuts will be felt across the board.</p> <p>Air force and navy aircraft procurement is set for a $4.2bn cut. Defence department operations and maintenance would lose $3.9bn. Pentagon healthcare would be cut by $3.3bn. The national institutes of health would lose $2.5bn. Rental assistance for the poor would be cut by $2.3bn, food safety and inspections would lose over $1bn. The FBI would lose $735m for salaries and expenses.</p> <p>The automatic cuts, called sequestration, were put in place in order to force an agreement between Republicans and Democrats on a deficit reduction plan following the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. But a bipartisan \"supercommitee\" set up to negotiate a compromise collapsed, leaving sequestration in place. Half the cuts will come from defence spending and half to social programs and other non-military funding.</p> <p>\"As the administration has made clear, no amount of planning can mitigate the effect of these cuts,\" the budget officer reported. \"Sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument. It is not the responsible way for our nation to achieve deficit reduction.\"</p> <p>The report calls the cuts \"deeply destructive to national security, domestic investments, and core government functions\".</p> <p>The cuts will come at the same time as Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire, together the spending cuts and tax hikes have been dubbed the \"fiscal cliff\".</p> <p>On Thursday, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said the fiscal cliff was a serious threat to the fragile US recovery. \"If the fiscal cliff isn't addressed, as I've said, I don't think our tools are strong enough to offset the effects of a major fiscal shock so we'd have to think about what to do in that contingency,\" said Bernanke. \"So I think it's really important for the fiscal policymakers to, you know, work together to try and find a solution for that.\"</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats appear at a stalemate as the White House insists any deficit-reduction deal includes more taxes and many Republicans focus on cuts to social social programs and government spending. Republican House speaker John Boehner said this week that a compromise seemed unlikely.</p>",

He won a court order last month for his execution date, originally set for last December, to be reinstated in protest at what he calls a \"broken system\".</p> <p>Haugen was condemned for murdering a fellow inmate nine years ago while serving a life term for beating his former girlfriend's mother to death with a hammer and a baseball bat in 1981.</p> <p>Kitzhaber issued a moratorium on executions last year, saying he regards the death penalty as \"morally wrong\". Haugen initially welcomed the move because he thought it amounted to a commutation of his sentence to life imprisonment but turned against the governor when he realised he was receiving only a temporary reprieve while the future of Oregon's death penalty is decided. </p> <p>If the state does not scrap capital punishment, the reprieve would not stop the next governor from ordering the execution of Haugen or any one of the 36 other people, including a woman, on death row.</p> <p>Haugen's lawyers argued that a reprieve, unlike a pardon, must be agreed by the condemned man. In August, a court agreed, setting the clock ticking again on his execution. </p> <p>Haugen said it was his right to choose to die.</p> <p>\"This is my free will. This is my constitutional right,\" he told the court. \"You know, we need to put this to sleep. That's probably the wrong expression.\"</p> <p>Kitzhaber, a former doctor who favours cowboy boots at the statehouse and wore jeans to his inauguration, announced the moratorium in November just two weeks before Haugen was to be put to death. He said his authorisation of the executions of two men during a previous term as governor in the 1990s had been \"the most agonising and difficult decisions\" he made in office and that he no longer believed in capital punishment. </p> <p>\"The death penalty as practiced in Oregon is neither fair nor just, and it is not swift or certain. It is not applied equally to all,\" Kitzhaber said in announcing the moratorium. \"It is time for Oregon to consider a different approach. I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer, and I will not allow further executions while I am governor.\"</p> <p>Kitzhaber said a particular problem is that only condemned prisoners who abandon the lengthy appeals process out of desperation are ever executed.<br> \"It is a perversion of justice that the single best indicator of who will and will not be executed has nothing to do with the circumstances of a crime or the findings of a jury. The only factor that determines whether someone sentenced to death in Oregon is actually executed is that they volunteer,\" he said.</p> <p>Jeff Ellis, director of Oregonians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, said that no one has been executed in the state in the past half a century who did not effectively ask to die.</p> <p>\"We haven't had an execution of an individual who's gone through the entire court process in over 50 years in Oregon. You get individuals who either suffer from mental illness or who get so beaten down by the conditions of enduring life on death row that every decade or so somebody gives up. Every decade or so we execute somebody who gave up along the way. That is hardly functioning system,\" he said. </p> <p>But the governor did not commute the sentences of those on death row to life imprisonment, as he had the power to do. He said that was not his decision to make given that a referendum voted to reinstate capital punishment in 1984 and he wanted the moratorium to prod the state legislature into a \"long overdue re-evaluation\" of the issue.</p> <p>Haugen said he agreed with the moratorium but criticised the governor for leaving death row prisoners to continue to deal with an appeals process Kitzhaber said is discredited. </p> <p>\"You're not going to execute people, but you're going to continue to allow people to litigate in a broken system?\" he told <a href=\"http://\">the Statesman Journal</a> in Oregon's capital, Salem.<br> Haugen called the governor's decision to grant him a temporary reprieve rather than commute his sentence \"a coward's move\" that left him in a \"void\". The condemned man mocked the governor, saying he did not have the guts to carry out the execution.</p> <p>\"I feel he's a paper cowboy,\" he said. \"He couldn't pull the trigger.\" <br> At a court hearing in July, Haugen's lawyer, Harrison Latto, said the reprieve was a form of torture. </p> <p>\"It could be a day, could be seven years. During that indefinite period of time, they're saying: sit tight and we'll tell you at the end of that period whether you'll be executed or not,\" he said.</p> <p>The governor's attorney, Tim Sylwester, said Haugen cannot refuse the reprieve unless it has strings attached. </p> <p>\"He has a death sentence he can't challenge,\" Sylwester said. \"Right now, you're serving a life sentence, it's unconditional. So you can't refuse it.\"</p> <p>The judge who cleared the way for Haugen to seek execution, Tim Alexander, said he set aside his personal views in doing so. </p> <p>\"I agree with many of the concerns expressed by the governor, and share his hope that the legislature will be receptive to modifying and improving Oregon laws regarding sentencing for aggravated murder,\" he said in his judgement. </p> <p>\"Many Oregon judges with experience presiding over death penalty cases would concur that the current law requires spending extraordinary sums of tax dollars that could be better used for other purposes to enforce a system that rarely, if ever, result in executions.\" </p> <p>Kitzhaber's spokesman, Tim Raphael, said the governor expects to prevail on appeal.</p> <p>\"We're confident the governor has the authority to issue a reprieve, and we look forward to getting clarity from the supreme court,\" he said.</p> <p>Ellis said that although he would like to see the total abolition of capital punishment in Oregon, he understood why Kitzhaber chose the interim measure of a temporary reprieve for Haugen rather than commuting the death sentences of all those facing possible execution. </p> <p>\"I think the governor was attempting to balance the power that he has as the chief executive in this state to grant clemency but also wanting to keep in mind the democratic will of the people,\" he said. \"I see his actions as completely consistent with the appropriate role of a governor in a democratic society.\" </p> <p>Oregon has had a turbulent relationship with the death penalty. It was outlawed in the state from 1914 to 1920, and again for 14 years from 1964. It was scrapped again in 1981 but reinstated three years later in a referendum.<br> Ellis said he thinks attitudes are again swinging away from capital punishment. </p> <p>\"I think Oregonians are ready to abolish it again. The death penalty debate has turned from a relatively simple debate \u2013 the choice of do you think it's moral or do you think it's immoral? \u2013 to a much more complex choice of whether this keeps us safe and, more importantly, are there better alternatives? We now know that the cost of the death penalty is extraordinary. In Oregon, we pay these extraordinary costs and the only people we execute are folks who give up their appeal,\" he said. </p> <p>It costs about $20m a year for the state to fund the legal process, including the mandatory 10 stages of appeal, as well as maintain death row \u2013 a significant amount at a time when the state is forcing deep cuts to education and other public services.</p> <p>But Kitzhaber's move met with strong criticism from some prosecutors in the state and the family of Haugen's first victim. </p> <p>District attorney Bernice Barnett, who sent another inmate to death row for murder, criticised the governor for not having told voters when he ran for election that he planned to impose a moratorium. Josh Marquis, another district attorney, accused Kitzhaber of failing to carry out his duty to follow the law. </p> <p>Ard Pratt, ex-husband of the woman Haugen beat to death, called the governor's granting of a reprieve \"a miscarriage of justice\".</p> <p>Haugen's defence lawyers last year attempted to argue that he is mentally unfit to decide his own fate because he suffers from attention deficit disorder, foetal alcohol syndrome and mental problems. </p> <p>During a hearing on his competence, Haugen made clear he wants to die.<br> \"Do you understand what the effect of the death sentence will be?\" he was asked.</p> <p>\"Well, one of them will be that we'll never have to have this conversation again,\" Haugen replied.</p>",
  "<p>Carine Roitfeld began wearing high heels in order to look Mario Testino in the eye. Long before she became editor of French Vogue, Roitfeld was a young stylist working with Testino, then a little-known photographer.</p> <p>\"Mario has a very strong idea of how a woman should look, how she should stand, how the photo should be,\" Roitfeld says. \"But I&#xa0;have a&#xa0;lot of ideas as well. So I had to get him to listen to me. It was difficult. Well, you know Mario is very tall. So I realised I needed to be looking him in the eye when we were shooting.\" Before that, she had usually worn flat shoes \u2013 for a&#xa0;stylist, a fashion shoot is a long working day spent mostly standing \u2013 but she swapped them for high heels. \"And it worked. He has good ideas, but I&#xa0;have good ideas too.\" The stilettos were a smart move. The early advertising campaigns the pair shot, for Tom Ford's Gucci, went on to define fashion's aesthetic for the best part of a&#xa0;decade.</p> <p>Interesting that Roitfeld, a controversial figure whose erotica-tinted aesthetic has been criticised as fuelling the sexualisation of fashion imagery, should use a stiletto on a fashion shoot not for sex appeal, but to square up to a male ego. Underestimate her at your peril. At 57 years old and after three decades in fashion, 20 months clear of a decade-long tenure at French Vogue, she is a rock star of the fashion front row. At <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/new-york-fashion-week\" title=\"\">New York fashion week</a> this week, the launch party for CR Fashion Book, the biannual magazine that marks Roitfeld's return to the editor's chair, was the invitation everyone wanted. On an evening that saw a tornado hit Queens, and Manhattan buffeted and drenched by wind and rain from the storm's coat-tails, every hot model in town showed up to the Frick Collection in black tie to pay homage to Roitfeld, who held court in bandage-tight, floor-length black Ala\u00efa.</p> <p>Our interview is originally scheduled for the day after the party, but Roitfeld's new baby granddaughter, three-month old Romy, turns out to be in town and at the party, Roitfeld asks if I mind moving our slot. (\"I must see her, I am sure you understand, no?\") Two days later, we meet at the Standard East, a fancy new downtown hotel that has loaned Roitfeld rooms on the 18th floor to use as offices. She is wearing her signature pencil skirt, today by Balenciaga, along with a fitted black sweater (Ala\u00efa) and towering apple-green platform sandals (Balenciaga). In person, she is surprisingly sweet, much more approachable than her public image suggests, with richly Parisian-flecked English that is as expressive as it is grammatically flawed.</p> <p>I ask how she enjoyed the party. \"I&#xa0;thought it was a great party, all the very beautiful people were there. But I&#xa0;had so many people to talk to. And I&#xa0;think maybe I drank a lot. Every time I&#xa0;am in a picture, someone takes my vodka glass away, because you don't want to hold a drink in a photograph. And every time the glass comes back, it is full. So I don't know how many vodkas, you see.\" At most such launches in NYC, the host nurses a Pellegrino.</p> <p>But then, nobody ever accused Roitfeld of being vanilla. Scandal is what&#xa0;she does. Her French Vogue was notorious for an aesthetic that was dubbed \"porno chic\": nudity, bondage, blood. Karen Elson was tied up with a curtain cord. Sometimes it seemed there were more pictures in hotel bedrooms than fashion studios, more nipples than dresses. She was accused of promoting anorexia by printing semi-nude photos of very thin models, and of racism when&#xa0;the blond Dutch model Lara Stone appeared in the magazine painted black. One of her final issues, guest edited by Tom Ford, featured a 10-year-old model in full makeup posing on a tiger skin. Shortly after that photo was published to a media furore, Roitfeld and Cond\u00e9 Nast went their separate ways.</p> <p>So when it was announced that Roitfeld was launching an independent magazine, with no prissy publishing house to worry about, the industry held its breath for the most outrageous magazine yet. As it turns out, the first issue of CR Fashion Book is a shock, but not in a way anyone predicted. Double-sided, the magazine has two covers. One shows Kate Upton, the voluptuous blond Sports Illustrated covergirl who resembles a young Monroe, holding a clutch of baby ducklings to her creamy bosom. The other shows a young girl wearing bunny ears, grinning from ear to ear while holding a plumply naked baby. Shot by Bruce Weber, the images radiate wholesomeness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396202715\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/14/1347638126666/CR-Fashion-Book-cover-008.jpg\" alt=\"CR Fashion Book cover\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is like a family picture, no? \u2026 the CR Fashion Book cover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"No one is expecting this, huh?\" Roitfeld smiles. \"They expect me to have a very sexy girl on the cover, Kate Moss, or Lara Stone, legs, very sexy, lots of black around the eyes. But when I&#xa0;started to plan this magazine, I had just found out my daughter was pregnant. I&#xa0;started seeing babies everywhere, because I was thinking all the time about babies. I am so happy to be a grandmother, and it is amazing to be around a baby again. Babies are a mind-opener. They make you see the world in a whole new way. I had forgotten all this, because it is a long time since my children [she has a grown-up son, Vladimir, as well as her daughter] were small.\" Her favourite image in the magazine is the cover shot of the girl holding the baby. \"The baby had just peed on her at that moment, and the girl was laughing, and her face was just so full of joy. It is like a family picture, no? Every family would love to have that picture on their chimney.\"</p> <p>Inside, there are more dimply naked babies and puppies and more pregnant women, including a portrait of daughter Julia taken while pregnant with Romy. There is a model in Givenchy haute couture pushing a pram, and another in black-lace Gucci carrying a baby doll. There are more headshots, and fewer nude shots, than in Roitfeld's Vogue. The running theme is \"Rebirth\". There is still eroticism and provocation \u2013 Ford has written and photographed a \"fairytale\" about a Princess of New York (\"when she was good, she was very, very good, but when she was bad, she was gorgeous\"), which includes a woman lying motionless in a glass casket, wearing a damson Dior suit and getting a&#xa0;pedicure. But the overall mood is upbeat, celebratory, and revolves around family. \"I wanted to do something different. When I did my book last year [Irreverent, a kind of visual autobiography], I was a little shocked because I did not realise I used so much blood, so many knives. The book was like going to a shrink. I am ready to do something new now. I have always had a&#xa0;different side to me, a very family side.</p> <p>\"I am a mum, and now I am a grandma, and I have been with the same man for ever (her partner is Christian Restoin).\" What's more, she says, it's not just her who is obsessed with babies. \"When I was young, no one got married. Now, all the young people, they want to get married, they want security. Now that my children's friends are getting married, I go to more weddings than I&#xa0;ever did when I was young.\"</p> <p>What Roitfeld has, which makes her bankable even in the dicey world of magazines, is a point of view everyone wants to hear. It is worth noting that her magazine is biannual, like the catwalk show season, launched concurrently with the catwalk shows, and \u2013 in contrast to any other fashion magazine \u2013 does not take its cue from the mood of the current season's clothes. (This autumn's clothes are rather dark and gothic, a world away from ducklings and bunny ears.) The format places her as an opinion-former alongside the designers, looking ahead to future seasons, rather than in line with traditional magazines, selling clothes currently in store. Oh, and the next issue, she says, will be completely different. \"You will be very surprised, I promise,\" she teases.</p> <p>\"Carine is a born performer, and magazines are her stage,\" says Stephen Gan, Roitfeld's business partner and longtime collaborator. Roitfeld and Gan, who is the editor-in-chief of V and creative director of Harper's Bazaar magazines, hatched the idea for CR Fashion Book in New York, early this year. The double-sided, wordless cover was conceived because the magazine, which sells for $15 (\u00a39.99), \"should be like a coffee-table book. When you get bored of one picture, you can turn it over,\" says Roitfeld. Features printed in other languages, such as Japanese (then translated on the following spread) are another innovation \"because the printed languages look so beautiful, and because I think international readers will be happy to see something in their language\".</p> <p>Advertising is placed alphabetically, with Alexander McQueen at the front and Valentino at the back. Did she have trouble convincing the advertisers to go along with it? \"No one had a problem with it!\" says Roitfeld triumphantly. Certainly, the 340-page issue is fat, with 150 pages (outpacing the original plan for 100) sold at $40,000 per double-page spread. CR Fashion Book will also have a&#xa0;life online. The traditional front-of-book, newsy section will live only on the website, alongside pictures and diary entries posted by Roitfeld. \"I am from the age of magazines,\" she says, \"so the internet is terrifying to me. But I am learning.\"</p> <p>In Roitfeld's account, most of the scandal that has swirled around her career is a fuss about nothing. She flatly denies she was fired from Vogue \u2013 and indeed, the last time I interviewed her, when she had been editor for eight years, she said she thought 10 years would be about the right length of time in the job. On the subject of controversy, she says she is \"against taboos\", but that she never printed an image she wouldn't want her children to see. She doesn't use cigarettes in her photographs. She dismisses as \"ridiculous\" the allegation of racism, saying her French edition featured many more black models than most European or American Vogues. \"For me, a model is never just a&#xa0;model. She is an actress. We are telling a story, and she is playing her part. I get on well with models and I like to treat them well.\" She rejects the moniker of \"porno chic\", preferring \"erotic chic\". The little girls in the Tom Ford shoot were not in any way exposed, she says: they wore T-shirts under their evening gowns. \"But people will see what they want to see.\"</p> <p>Nor will she acknowledge any rivalry with Anna Wintour, however much the fashion industry may stir. \"Anna was my boss for a long time. I respect her. We worked fine together. She's tough, but she's honest. And when my kids moved to New York, she was one of the first people who invited them to dinner. As a mum, I don't forget that.\"</p> <p>Leaving the cushioned world of Vogue was, she says, a shock. \"Before, I had an assistant, a&#xa0;car, everything organised for me. Now I have to call taxis on the street. Vogue was like a golden cage. It is a beautiful life, but for me, it is better to have a change. I feel I am making a new family. It is a wonderful new energy.\"</p> <p>Roitfeld is in a good mood. \"I'm happy because I didn't know how it would be, to be at fashion shows, and not be the editor of Vogue. I did not know where they would sit me. You know what the fashion world can be like ... and now I am happy and surprised, because I know I have many friends.\" Zipping around New York in yellow taxis, she finds, is fine. She tells me that she has taken up ballet classes in recent years, and stands to show me the extra strips of fabric her dressmaker has inserted in her pencil skirt, because \"still I am skinny, but now my bottom is more round. It's good, no? I don't want to do Botox, that kind of thing. But I think how you hold yourself is very important. Ballet is good, because it makes you stand up tall.\"</p>",

  "<p>England's club power-brokers are under increasing pressure over the legitimacy of their new \u00a3152m broadcasting deal with BT after the Rugby Football Union announced it had not given its consent to Premiership Rugby Limited to negotiate television rights for European fixtures from 2014.</p> <p>Although the RFU stopped short of rebuking its club counterpart, it undermines PRL's confident boast of a \"game-changing\" initiative that would lead to the Heineken Cup disappearing in its present form at the end of next season. It also raises the stakes before Tuesday's board meeting of European Rugby Cup Ltd, the union-based body that currently controls European club rugby.</p> <p>Earlier in the day the PRL chairman, Quentin Smith, had been forced to issue a statement denying that a majority of Premiership clubs had lost faith in the chief executive, Mark McCafferty, as doubts swirled over whether he had a proper mandate to sell the rights for games in a future European tournament to BT Vision. \"The clubs have full confidence in Mark McCafferty and support him in implementing the broadcast deal,\" said Smith.</p> <p>As well as European Rugby Cup Ltd, which runs the existing Heineken Cup, the English clubs' initiative has infuriated a number of unions before Tuesday's prearranged ERC board meeting to debate the future shape of European competitions. It remains unclear whether PRL has the authority to market a tournament that does not yet exist and which it cannot unilaterally control.</p> <p>Under the terms of the eight-year peace accord with the RFU that runs until 2016, responsibility for TV rights would theoretically revert to the union after that date. The new deal agreed with BT runs until 2018 but for now the RFU is playing a waiting game. \"While the RFU has not given consent to Premiership Rugby to grant European broadcasting rights, we believe it is important to work with them and with all parties involved to find common ground,\" a statement said.</p> <p>The key to the argument would appear to lie with the French clubs, without whom their English counterparts would not have a meaningful product. Patrick Wolff, vice-president of the Ligue Nationale de Rugby and one of the two French representatives at Tuesday's meeting, has admitted the Top 14 clubs will be looking for urgent answers before they commit to joining any new European venture.</p> <p>\"For us the most important thing is that we don't want to waste one or two years on lawyers explaining who has the rights,\" said Wolff, who is hoping a final agreement will be forthcoming by the end of December. \"We want a quick answer. If we waste two years everyone will lose \u2013 Celts, English and French. We don't want any battles in the law courts.\"</p> <p>The Premiership and Top 14 clubs are both seeking an amended share of revenues and a fairer qualification process but Wolff made clear he would prefer all European nations to be represented in a revamped tournament. He said: \"The Heineken Cup is a very good competition and we don't want to kill it. I can't imagine the French will allow the big games like Clermont against Leinster not to happen. We will do our best to keep these type of games.\"</p> <p>The English official Dave Pearson, meanwhile, has been appointed as the Six Nations' first elite referee coach.

It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them.\"</p> <p>The magazine's publication of the intrusive pictures re-ignited memories of the pursuit of the duke's mother, Princess Diana, by paparazzi on the night of her death in a high-speed car accident in a Paris tunnel.</p> <p>Legal action will be taken under French privacy law, considered the toughest in Europe, with potential for both civil and criminal cases.</p> <p>French media lawyer Jean Frederic Gaultier of Olswangs said under French criminal law, the magazine could face a fine of up to \u20ac45,000 (\u00a336,000) and the editor could be jailed for up to 12 months.</p> <p>\"There could be a case for criminal action, if the photographs are taken or a voice is recorded in a private place without the people knowing. They were in a private place, so in my view this was a breach of law,\" said Gaultier.</p> <p>He said it was unheard of for an editor to be jailed and celebrity magazines in France are generally willing to risk fines if the benefits of boosting circulation and revenues outweigh any fines for breaching the law.</p> <p>Over five pages, Closer published what it described as exclusive pictures of the duchesss topless under the headline: \"Oh my God \u2013 sex and sun en Provence.\" The pictures were apparently taken on the terrace of a guest house during a brief holiday with the duke in France last week.</p> <p>Royal photographer Harry Page told Sky News that from what he had seen, they were taken with long lenses and the couple would have had no idea they were being photographed.</p> <p>Closer magazine defended its decision, with its editor-in-chief Laurence Pieau describing the photos as a beautiful series that showed a couple in love and saying they were in no way degrading.</p> <p>She said the magazine had more intimate shots from the same series that it opted not to publish. \"There's been an over-reaction to these photos. What we see is a young couple, who just got married, who are very much in love, who are splendid,\" Pieau told French TV news channel BFM.</p> <p>\"She's a real 21st Century princess,\" she added: \"It's a young woman who is topless, the same as you can see on any beach in France or around the world.\"</p> <p>Closer published a dozen shots of the duchess as she relaxed in Provence at a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen's nephew, ahead of the couple's diamond jubilee tour of south-east Asia and the South Pacific on behalf of the Queen.</p> <p>With a cover headline Oh my God!, the photos show the couple soaking up the sun on the balcony of a 19th-century hunting lodge, oblivious to lurking paparazzi.</p> <p>They show her taking off her bikini top, sunbathing on a sun lounger and at one point pulled down the back of her bikini bottoms as Prince William applies sun cream.</p> <p>Sources at St James's Palace said they had no advance warning about the photos before publication and by the time they learned of Closer's plans it was too late to try and get an injunction to prevent the magazine going on sale in France on Friday morning.</p> <p>The publication of the pictures is a blow to Buckingham Palace as it tries to move on from a scandal over naked shots of Prince Harry that tarred the image of the royal family, which had been bolstered by the duke and duchess's wedding, the Queen's 2012 diamond jubilee and her surprise cameo in the London Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>Newspapers in Britain were not offered the photographs publisher by Closer. They were offered a different set of long-lens shots last week, but turned them down.</p> <p>Publication of the pictures was also condemned by Bauer, the owner of Closer magazine in the UK, which had licensed Berlusconi's company to publish the French version. The company demanded Closer remove the pictures from its website immediately and in a veiled threat to sever ties with the publisher, said it was \"reviewing the terms of our licence agreement with Closer France\".</p> <p>\"Like our readers, we are appalled and regret the pain the publication of these photographs has caused,\" said Paul Keenan, chief executive of Bauer media, who said the company \"deplore the publication of these intrusive and offensive pictures\".</p> <p>Executives on two national tabloids said the set of photos being touted around last week were different. \"They were also long lens, but you couldn't see anything. These pictures nobody has seen, as far I am aware,\" one picture editor said.</p> <p>Page, a photographer who has worked with national newspapers for the past 30 years, said: \"From what I have seen, these photos have been taken from a very long way. Kate and William would have had no idea they were being taken.</p> <p>\"They were on a 640-acre estate in the south of France. I think they would have expected a certain degree of privacy. They were on a private holiday.</p> <p>\"Remember the toe-sucking photos of Fergie [Sarah Ferguson], again in the south of France. That is exactly 20 years ago this month and there was a scramble for them. But now there is not a single newspaper in Britain who would publish these pictures.\"</p> <p>The royal family only rarely and reluctantly resorts to legal action over media coverage, despite being constantly in the spotlight. The Duchess of Cambridge has taken action over invasion of privacy once before, receiving an apology, damages and legal costs from picture agency Rex in March 2010 after it distributed photos of her taken during a private holiday in Cornwall.</p> <p>The Prince of Wales won a protracted legal battle over privacy with the Mail on Sunday in late 2006, when the court of appeal ruled that the paper had infringed his copyright and confidentiality by publishing extracts from his private diaries about the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.</p> <p>Princess Diana sued the Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror in 1993 over secretly-taken pictures of her exercising in a gym and won an injunction against the publishing preventing further publication. The Queen dropped legal action against the Daily Mirror after a reporter breached royal security to work as a palace footman in 2003,.</p> <p>The publication of the topless pictures of the duchess are also likely to be taken into account by Lord Justice Leveson, who is currently drafting his final report offering recommendations to the government on the future of press regulation. The latest controversy will underline the difficulties any future British regulator will have in controlling overseas internet publication of content that can be viewed online in the UK.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2012. The original described Silvio Berlusconi as a former Italian president, rather than prime minister.</p>",
  "<p>Two days isn't nearly enough time to get to grips with the current Liverpool Biennial, which opens on Saturday.</p> <p>I hurried through the John Moores Painting Prize exhibition, now in its 50th year. Very little rubbed off on me. Lost in the exhibition City States, which takes us from Birmingham to Gdansk, from Greenland to Taipei, and occupies a vast acreage of Liverpool's former postal sorting office, I could have been anywhere. Here I spent about half an hour circumnavigating a humongous inflatable black pillow, wedged between floor and ceiling, by a collective from Vilnius. The bloated black form might signify the big sleep.</p> <p>Around a corner are versions of Morris Louis's 1960's drip-and-pour paintings, executed, inexplicably, by North Korean weavers. Why, you ask. The answer is very long indeed.</p> <p>Every few hours, I slipped down to the waterfront, to check if Anthony McCall's much anticipated column of cloud had yet ascended across the Mersey. Wind and weather and technical glitches have meant that this, the most spectacular of the biennial's works, has yet to take off. Of such mysteries and expectations biennials are made, from Liverpool to Sydney.</p> <p>Since its inception in 1999, the Liverpool Biennial has itself struggled to take off. Under the new artistic directorship of Sally Tallant, it is trying to refocus. The overall theme, hospitality, is more complex than it sounds, though whether it helps us cross and recross the city in search of its roster of 242 artists in 27 locations, is moot.</p> <p>Better to sit in a room and think. But not perhaps in Finnish artist Markus K\u00e5hre's fake hotel suite, on the 1st floor of the Monro pub. Everything, from the table lamps to the windows, walls and doors, is a perfect simulacrum, fabricated by the artist. We take it all as real, until we look in the mirrors on the wall, which reflect everything except ourselves. This is disturbing and uncanny, unless you happen to be a vampire or a ghost. Even the daylight is fake.</p> <p>K\u00e5hre's work is perfectly in tune with the title of the biennial's main exhibition, The Unexpected Guest. In art, we are used to expecting the unexpected, though genuine surprise is rare. Biennial after biennial, the same fashionable names with their familiar stratagems appear. Here comes Dora Garcia, who's always everywhere, there goes Argentinian Jorge Macchi, who \"questions our ability to locate ourselves in space\", by way of bent iron bars, which intend to simulate the effects of refraction in water. It doesn't work. I much prefer the games room set up by Pedro Reyes at FACT. Somehow, I ended up playing a sexed-up version of snakes and ladders with the Mexican cultural attach\u00e9, while small children milled about, whacking each other in a pillow fight.</p> <p>Sometimes I felt less a guest, more an ingrate, especially as I queued to get into the non-existent nightclub behind Elmgreen and Dragset's freestanding VIP door in the Liverpool ONE shopping precinct. A genial but unmovable doorman tells anyone who asks that they're not on the guestlist.</p> <p>There are plenty of such lighthearted works here, from the multi-coloured plastic pigeons roosting at the entrance to the Walker Art Gallery (a work that rips-off Maurizio Cattelan's stuffed pigeons that have been in at least two Venice Biennales), to Superflex's Liverpool To Let, a bunting of estate agents' signage, which festoons part of the enormous ground floor space of the Cunard Building, which few artists occupy with any real presence.</p> <p>Althea Thauberger's video staging of Peter Weiss's 1963 play Marat/Sade, and Sylvie Blocher's video reworkings of speeches by the likes of Angela Davis and Karl Marx, had a real spring and surprise. Marx has never sounded so good as declaimed by a semi-clothed Russian punk rapper.</p> <p>We are less guests than voyeurs to Japanese photographer Kohei Yoshiyuki's famous but rarely seen The Park, at the Open Eye Gallery. These 1970s images of public sex in a Tokyo park, at night, are more funny than salacious, and shown in a blacked-out room. You search for the images with a torch, and become one with the furtive spectators spying on all the goings-on.</p> <p>People like to watch, and others like to be watched, and some like to listen. Doug Aitken's The Source, in a building especially designed by David Adjaye, presents a series of interviews with major creative figures about the sources of their creativity. The sound levels are too low and the videos are screened simultaneously about the circular space. It is almost impossible to concentrate on William Eggleston's ruminative mumble, or to focus on Mike Kelley in probably his last interview before his suicide earlier this year. The interviews are great, but Aiken has turned them into a sort of cocktail party babble.</p> <p>The best work in the biennial is undoubtedly John Akomfrah's The Unfinished Conversation, a three-screen video based on the life, work and talk of the incomparable Jamaican-born thinker Stuart Hall, at the Bluecoat Gallery. Much more than biopic, Akomfrah juxtaposes archive news footage, readings of William Blake, Dickens and Virginia Woolf and most of all Hall's own voice, to describe the world's tumbling. Hall's thoughts about identity, immigration and selfhood, evolve through a roar of telling images. Akomfrah's film, like the essence of Hall's work, is about the conundrum of being in the world, and is as unexpected as it is brilliant.</p>",
  "<p>I met Tyler Hamilton in the lobby of a Toulouse hotel during the 2003 Tour de France. Hamilton was performing what seemed at the time like one of the greatest rides in the history of the race, appropriately in the centenary Tour; he was fighting his way through it with a double crack in his collarbone and was highly placed overall. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/20/tourdefrance2003.tourdefrance3\" title=\"\">It made a great interview for the Observer</a>; my companion and I left feeling quietly impressed with the guy. I had heard that the American, from Marblehead, Massachusetts, was quiet, even boring, but he was perfectly eloquent at talking about the pain he was enduring.</p> <p>It was difficult not to be inspired by the suffering Hamilton was going through, just as it was difficult not to raise eyebrows and wonder what the hell was going on when he rode away from the entire field in the Pyrenees, up the steepest climb of the race, broken collarbone and all, to win in Bayonne. Struggling to stay in contact with the leaders seemed within the bounds of possibility; winning a stage by four minutes did not add up.</p> <p>So it was not a massive surprise to learn that Hamilton had injected a bag of blood the night before the stage to Bayonne, increasing his performance by 3%, or so he writes in his account of his doping journey, The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups and Winning at All Costs. That is pretty much what the book, written jointly with the American journalist Daniel Coyle, inspired in me: not surprise so much as the occasional jolt of shock at the grimy practicalities and the odd drop of my jaw at the means Hamilton says that he, Lance Armstrong and others used to stay ahead of the testers and the police.</p> <p>In the broader sense this book is old news, at least compared with Willy Voet's Breaking the Chain, which I translated following its publication in 1999. Voet's revelations were fresh; the Festina scandal had broken less than a year before it appeared. In the same way that the Armstrong saga has been a 10-year drip-feed of revelation, we have had eight years to get used to the idea that Hamilton was riding on blood transfusions, because he was busted for blood doping in 2004, while leaks during the Operaci\u00f3n Puerto inquiry left no room for error about his prolific drug-taking.</p> <p>What Hamilton's account does do is offer an initial, and deep, insight into the evidence that Armstrong refused to confront when he opted out of arbitration in the case that the US Anti-Doping Agency had built against him and his associates. Armstrong's surrender \u2013 with its implicit acceptance of the charges the Usada had raised against him \u2013 made a contorted kind of sense on 25 August, as it does now, given the material in the book.</p> <p>Looking back to 1999, I was naive to assume that year that the threat of police raids would make the cyclists leave their drugs at home. While the fear seems to have made many of them ride clean (a vast percentage of the samples from 1999 tested later for erythropoietin were clean), that in turn rewarded those who took special measures and doped up. In the case of Armstrong and Hamilton this meant hiring a motorcyclist, nicknamed Motoman, to transport their EPO.</p> <p>The following year, with a new test in the pipeline for that blood booster, Armstrong and US Postal switched to microdoses of EPO (to reduce \"glowtime\", as they call the period when a rider will test positive after an injection) but primarily to blood transfusions \u2013 a bigger boost to performance but involving trips to Spain by private jet to have blood removed before it was reinjected for the key moments in the race. Blood doping later became more sophisticated, once Hamilton had left Postal and taken up with the egregious Dr Eufemiano Fuentes, alleged supplier of blood doping services extraordinaire, albeit one who insists he is innocent. Blood is taken out and reinjected in epic quantities; it is frozen and manipulated. Occasionally it goes off, to disastrous effect.</p> <p>The methods used for concealment are the stuff of the underworld: multiple pay-as-you-go mobile phones, constantly changed, codes for the numbers of rooms in obscure hotels where blood is taken out and put back in, elaborate measures to dispose of evidence, on one occasion hiring a flat in Monaco for one transfusion, hidden there for a month with Hamilton and his then wife, Haven, keeping an eye on it. But above all, constant paranoia, fear of the opposition, fear of discovery. It is sport but not as mere mortals can imagine it or report it, in the case of my colleagues and I. We suspected and conjectured, while being unable to put our disquiet into print; quite how we could have uncovered it I cannot imagine, given the elaborate measures to which the drugtakers were resorting to ensure secrecy.</p> <p>Amid the blood there are telling insights into Armstrong: \"He believed \u2013 still believes \u2013 that he wasn't cheating, because in his mind all the contenders in the race \u2026 had their own version of Motoman, everybody was doing everything they could to win and, if they weren't, they were choads [an insult particular to Armstrong, somewhere between a chump and a toad] and didn't deserve to win.\"</p> <p>If there is a note of optimism that can be taken from this book, it is not from Hamilton's story, but the background: testing, more and more stringently, particularly out of competition, clearly does have an effect: it piles on the pressure, forcing the drug takers and the men who run the blood banks into mistakes, such as traces of banned drugs unintentionally finding their way into a bag of blood which then show up positive. Testing does not net them all \u2013 Armstrong never failed a test \u2013 but it catches enough to make a difference.</p> <p>Hamilton's downfall, that positive for blood doping in 2004, it seems, is most probably due to an error by Fuentes, who was seemingly supplying so many names in the peloton that he may have given the American the wrong bag. (In a wry-smile footnote that you simply couldn't make up, it seems that his sidekick may have suffered from dementia.)</p> <p>This is not an account that will engender a great deal of sympathy, at least not in my mind. Hamilton suffered severe depression, sacrificed his marriage and lost a million dollars fighting for years to maintain the lie that he had raced clean. He does not paint himself as a victim: he had a choice and he made the choice. His story, and that of the seven-times Tour winner with whom it runs in parallel, is a defining example of what we all tell our children: one lie leads to another, they grow and take on a life of their own.</p> <p>Any residual feeling I might have felt for a man who fouled up his life as Hamilton did evaporates on page 19, after his account of that stage win in Bayonne, where he writes: \"You can call me a cheater and doper until the cows come home. But the fact remains that in a race where everybody had equal opportunity, I played the game and I played it well.\" The ultimate drug taker's argument: they all did it, so I had to do it. Not everyone in that race had access to Fuentes or Motoman. Hamilton did not have to do it. They do not have to do it.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780593071731\">Tyler Hamilton's The Secret Race is available now</a></em></p>",
  "<p>At about 8am on Friday, almost nine days after she was rushed to Grenoble university hospital in a state which police later described as somewhere \"between life and death\", Zainab al-Hilli was whisked away from France by British police and taken to a secret location in the UK. Her departure was a rare ray of light in the otherwise unrelentingly bleak story of her family's sudden, brutal and as yet unexplained killing in the French Alps.</p> <p>Not only was her survival against all the odds, but it also reportedly enabled her to give investigators a key piece of witness testimony from the massacre, in a secluded clearing beside a forest road, of her mother, father and grandmother. According to police sources quoted by AFP and a French television station, the seven-year-old told investigators before leaving hospital that she had seen only one \"baddie\" during the attack that killed Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier.</p> <p>Public prosecutor Eric Maillaud warned this week that investigators could not depend on any evidence which might be given by Zainab \u2013 but her statement, if officially confirmed, is highly significant nonetheless. She is, as he has said, the only living person who actually saw what happened. And the inquiry, now spread across four countries and occupying dozens of officers on both sides of the Channel, has so far raised many more questions than there are, as yet, answers.</p> <p>At a press conference in Annecy this week before he headed to Britain for meetings with police, Maillaud said there were three leads but no suspect, and warned that such cases could often take \"two years, three years or 10 years\" to crack. \"It's not like the American TV series [CSI],\" he added, with a hint of irritation, \"where they solve everything in 45 minutes.\"</p> <p>It is perhaps testament to the other-worldly horror of what awaited them on the winding Combe d'Ire forest road near Chevaline on Wednesday afternoon last week that both main witnesses who stumbled on the crime scene also used the prism of sensationalised fiction to describe it. \"There was no sound. It was like in a film,\" Philippe Didierjean, a French hiker, told Le Parisien. \"One of those TV series where everything starts with a murder. Except this time we were the actors and we couldn't change channels with a remote control.\"</p> <p>Before him, inside their maroon BMW with the engine still revving, had lain the bodies of Saad al-Hilli, a 50-year-old British-Iraqi engineer, his wife, a 47-year-old dentist, and his 74-year-old Swedish-Iraqi mother-in-law. Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three from the nearby village of Ugine, was lying dead on the road.</p> <p>Unbeknown at that time to Didierjean and to Brett Martin, an RAF veteran believed to have been the first on the scene, four-year-old Zeena al-Hilli was hiding beneath the skirts of her mother inside the footwell of the car. She would not be discovered by police for another eight hours. The family, from Claygate, Surrey, had been on the fifth day of their camping holiday near Lake Annecy.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath, locals were shocked and, understandably, concerned for their own safety. \"I thought it was a guy who wanted to let rip,\" said Paul Ducher, a farmer mucking out his cowshed in Chevaline. He and many others feared that one seemingly random shooting spree could quite easily be followed by another. Before long, however, that initial panic ebbed away as indications grew that these were more likely to have been planned killings, the roots of which lay far away from Chevaline. \"This goes way beyond us,\" said Martial, Ducher's neighbour.</p> <p>Richard Gessner, a businessman who used to live in the village, said the \"bizarre\" nature of the saga \u2013 its international scope, its hint of intrigue \u2013 had caused many locals to detach themselves from it. \"That's why it hasn't had such a big impact here,\" he said. \"The first day, there was an impact because the locals thought there might be a madman on the loose, but now the indications are that it was a contract killing, a targeting thing, they're not as worried.\"</p> <p>If it had ever been in any doubt, the international dimension to the case was made clear this week when, as Surrey police carried out a search of the Hillis' mock Tudor home, Maillaud and one of the two French investigating magistrates, Michel Mollin, flew in for a 24-hour visit to \"improve co-ordination\" and \"iron out\" any communication issues between the forces. As he arrived, Maillaud said he believed Annecy was merely where the murders happened to have been carried out, and not where the \"origin, causes and explications\" of the crime lay. They, he said, were in Britain.</p> <p>Police are clear that two of the three leads they are following would appear at least partly to be rooted in the UK. The first \u2013 an alleged family feud between Saad and his elder brother, Zaid, over their father's inheritance money \u2013 has been the subject of much speculation. Zaid, who also lives in Surrey, has been repeatedly questioned by police as a witness. He vehemently denies any involvement in his brother's death.</p> <p>The second area of investigation is Hilli's work as an engineer in Britain. He was employed at a satellite technology company in Surrey and had his own business, SH Tech, specialising in technical design for the aircraft industry.</p> <p>The third lead \u2013 regarded as the most difficult but potentially the most fruitful \u2013 takes the focus away from Surrey and towards Iraq, where Hilli was born and grew up. He came to Britain in the 1970s, while Saddam Hussein was building a power base before becoming president in 1979, and studied in London. He is known to have kept ties to his home country and is reported to have returned there two years ago in an attempt to recover a house and a business.</p> <p>French police have enlisted the help of international specialists from the national detective branch to help them pursue this line of inquiry. But Maillaud said they feared having great difficulty obtaining reliable information from Iraq.</p> <p>The other main source of speculation \u2013 a son of Suhaila al-Allaf's in Sweden who is reported to have experienced mental health problems and violent outbursts \u2013 was dismissed by Maillaud as of little significance.</p> <p>So where does this leave the investigation? A police source said Maillaud was not exaggerating when he warned that cracking this most perplexing of cases could take years. This week, police in the area around Chevaline have been working through witness statements, preparing to requestion, retrace and re-examine. They were reported on Friday to be hoping to track down a dark Mitsubishi 4x4 apparently seen in the area on the day of the attack. Meanwhile, the Hillis' BMW is being studied by forensic experts at Rosny-sous-Bois near Paris for any evidence that may not yet have been revealed. But the next step forward could well have come from a little girl, recently orphaned, whose biggest worry 10 days ago was starting back at school this week and on whose delicate shoulders now lies the burden of a vast and mysterious police inquiry.</p>",
  "<p>The Captain Mainwaring style of banking is back. At Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which has been opening UK branches at the rate of one every 10 days for the past year or more, staff do not earn bonuses for selling customers products they do not want, and those customers can speak to their branch manager rather than going through to a call centre.</p> <p>The bank's 137-strong network, with 1,100 staff, already spreads from Truro in the south west of England to Aberdeen in Scotland . That is more branches than publicity-hungry Virgin Money has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/08/virgin-money-takes-over-northern-rock\" title=\"\">after buying the 74 from nationalised Northern Rock at the start of the year</a>.</p> <p>Yet many Britons may will never have heard of it. There is no billboard advertising or sports sponsorship. As Anders Bouvin, chief executive of the UK business, explains it relies on word of mouth among small business and current account customers.</p> <p>Such rapid expansion might be cause for alarm but with the government encouraging challengers to take on the \"big four\" and get lending to small business, Handelsbanken can be ambitious. \"I can't see that there is any to reason to reduce that rate [of branch opening], if anything it would increase,\" said Bouvin.</p> <p>Even so, questions about a target number of branches or sales are brushed aside as Handelsbanken \u2013 which has had a presence in the UK since 1982 \u2013 does not have a marketing department or budget. It has lent more than \u00a39bn since 2008, still a tiny fraction of the amount of loans granted in the banking system each year. \"It's all about seeing opportunities when they arise,\" he said.</p> <p>Many of the principles that trip off Bouvin's tongue as he explains the culture of the bank \u2013 which was on its knees 40 years ago before Swedish businessman Jan Wallander stepped in and devised the ethos that survives today \u2013 sound similar to those uttered by UK bankers currently trying to repair their battered reputations. \"You've got to understand your customers' needs, their dreams,\" said Bouvin.</p> <p>\"It's a good business if you have satisfied customers,\" he said.</p> <p>There is no command and control function. The head office does not take day-to-day decisions on lending. Each of Bouvin's branch managers is in control, reporting in to its main London office \u2013 with its striking views of Tower Bridge \u2013 via three regional offices in London, Birmingham and Manchester. A fourth regional office will open in Bristol next year.</p> <p>He asks who is going to know the needs of customers better \u2013 \"people like me in this ivory tower or local people who are geographically closer to their customers?\"</p> <p>The model is built upon the one used by the Swedish parent company. After its financial meltdown in the 1970s, Wallander stepped in to unwind what he regarded as US management methods which had made it too centralised, taking two months to approve a loan.</p> <p>Bouvin talks about the \"church spire principle\". He says: \"Every branch has its defined market area. It shouldn't be larger than you can see if you crawl up to the top of the local church tower.\"</p> <p>Unlike other banks, its branches do not have signs displaying loan rates or savings products in their windows. It does not appear in best buy tables. Every product is bespoke. This lack of price transparency and cherry-picking of customers is one area of potential criticism. Bouvin sees it differently. \"Our customers are in control of their finances.\"</p> <p>When asked whether such a decentralised approach leaves the bank vulnerable to branch managers being lax or hiding problem loans, he is also robust. \"Our track record proves the opposite.\"</p> <p>Putting confidence in staff makes them careful, he said. And there are no bonuses or sales targets which might encourage risk-taking. Instead a profit-share type operation \u2013 known as Oktogonen (after the bank's octogon logo) \u2013 was set up in 1973. If the bank has achieved a better return on equity than its peers in any year then a contribution is made into Oktogonen which is then tied up, largely in Handelsbanken shares, until the recipient turns 60.</p> <p>Niels Kroner, in his book about the bank, wrote that it \"has the ethos of a well-functioning 19th-century civil service\".</p> <p>He said: \"The staff are no geniuses perhaps but talented and moderately ambitious people who are motivated to do what is right because it is right, not because it earns them a financial reward.\"</p> <h2>Fair shares<br></h2> <p>The six or so Handelsbanken staff who joined the bank's profit-sharing scheme when it was set up in 1973 and are still in employment could now be in line for a \u00a3900,000 nest egg at 60 \u2013 the age at which they can cash in the units for the first time.</p> <p>The system, named Oktogonen after the bank's octogon logo, lies at the heart of how the bank operates.</p> <p>Instead of the bonuses typical of other banks, money is allocated to the fund when the bank is more profitable than its rivals. Every employee, from the most junior to the most senior, receives the same allocation.</p> <p>About 90% of the funds are used to buy Handelsbanken shares and locked up until the member turns 60.</p> <p>However, this scheme has run into the trouble in the UK and has not been able to make allocations to staff for the last two years, when tax laws changed and exposed employees to double taxation when the units are allocated and cashed in.</p> <p>The bank is still looking for a solution to the problem.</p>",

  "<p>The number of lawsuits against News International over News of the World phone hacking continues to mount, with more than 40 new claims filed by individuals including Sarah Ferguson, former footballer Tony Adams and Joanne Lees, whose boyfriend Peter Falconio was murdered in Australia.</p> <p>Others filing claims for News of the World phone hacking damages ahead of Friday's deadline for new civil actions set by the high court judge presiding over the process include the Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson, Uri Geller, and ex EastEnders actors Leslie Grantham and Tamzin Outhwaite.</p> <p>They have been joined by former Boyzone singer Keith Duffy, Joe Royle, ex manager of Everton and Manchester City, and Tony Woodley, formerly joint general secretary of the Unite trade Union.</p> <p>Friday's new claims bring the total number of fresh civil cases against News International since it paid out to 58 victims earlier in the year to 121. More claims are expected to be lodged at the high court in London on Friday but will not be made public by court documents until Monday.</p> <p>Hugh Tomlinson, QC, representing phone-hacking victims, told a high court case management conference earlier this month that in addition, 124 phone-hacking claims have been accepted into the News International compensation fund. He said he believed the total number of new claims will be \"somewhere under 300\".</p> <p>Ferguson, Prince Andrew's ex wife, former England and Arsenal captain Adams, are among the most high profile of the latest batch of alleged News of the World phone hacking victims.</p> <p>Lees, who had a difficult relationship with the press after her boyfriend Falconio was murdered while they were travelling in the Australian outback in 2001, is one of a number of victims of crimes that the paper allegedly targeted.</p> <p>Hugh Grant and Charlotte Church's priest, Father Reardon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/13/phone-hacking-hugh-grant-high-court\" title=\"\">are among 13 other claimants</a> who have filed lawsuits this week. Others who have filed damages claims in the last week include TV presenter Chris Tarrant, ex Oasis manager Alan McGee, former EastEnders star Sid Owen, actor Darren Day, and the Labour party's regional organiser for London, Hilary Perrin.</p> <p>A further 68 claims were filed by the beginning of September from individuals including Cherie Blair, footballer Wayne Rooney, Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell, David Beckham's father Ted, John Major's former daughter in law Emma Noble and a witness in the Tommy Sheridan perjury trial, Lily Colvin.</p> <p>In January and February this year, News International settled 58 News of the World phone hacking cases out of court. Those who received damages included celebrities such as Jude Law and Sienna Miller, and crime victims Sara Payne, the mother of murdered school girl Sarah Payne, and Shaun Russell, whose wife and daughter were killed in a hammer attack in a country lane.</p> <p>Mr Justice Vos, the high court judge overseeing the new round of civil actions, had originally pencilled in February as the date for these cases to go to trial, but this has now been put back to some time after May because of a potential clash with criminal proceedings involving former News International executives, including Rebekah Brooks, who was chief executive and Andy Coulson, who was the editor of the News of the World.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 September 2012.

  "<p>Twitter has relented in its fight with New York prosecutors to hand over three months worth of messages from an Occupy Wall Street protester ahead of the activist's criminal trial.</p> <p>Twitter had argued that the posts belong to Malcolm Harris and as such it would be violating fourth amendment privacy rights if it were to disclose the communications.</p> <p>But having lost a legal appeal against a subpoena, Twitter faced the prospect of steep fines if it did not comply with the judges order to turn over the tweets to the Manhattan district attorney's office.</p> <p>The firm handed over the tweets on Friday after being told by a New York judge that it would be held in contempt after that date.</p> <p>The activist has been charged with disorderly conduct in relation to a protest on the Brooklyn Bridge in October last year. He was among several hundred Occupy Wall Street demonstrators arrested during the protest march.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that messages posted by Harris \u2013 who goes by the twitter handle @destructuremal \u2013 could show whether the defendant was aware that he was breaking police orders relating to the demo.</p> <p>In January, the New York district attorney's office issued a subpoena to Twitter, calling on the firm to hand over \"any and all user information, including email address, as well as any and all tweets posted for the period 9/15/2011 \u2013 12/31/2011\".</p> <p>Harris initially attempted to block the move, but was told that he had no proprietary interest to his own messages.</p> <p>Twitter countered that this contradicts its own terms and conditions, which explicitly states that users \"retain their right to any content they submit, post or display on or through\". Moreover, in its own legal challenge to the subpoena, the firm accused prosecutors of trying to force its employees to violate federal law.</p> <p>Lawyers for Twitter also argued that under the Uniform Act, prosecutors would need to obtain a subpoena in California before it could demand documents from a company based in that state.</p> <p>But a New York judge rejected most of the firm's arguments and ordered Twitter to hand over the messages to the court, which would review the material and hand over relevant tweets to prosecutors</p> <p>No one at the firm was available to comment, and the New York's district attorney's office declined to respond.</p> <p>Harris' lawyer, Martin Stolar, said the decision by Twitter to hand his client's messages \"certainly doesn't help our case\".</p> <p>He added: \"I assume Twitter made a business decision, that they did not want to go into contempt. I would think they would be better off making a business decision to stick up for the fundamental privacy rights of their customers.\"</p> <p>Harris has pleaded not guilty. Mr Stolar said Friday that he would continue to appeal against the tweets being used as evidence in any criminal trial.</p>",
  "<p>When Werner Herzog says a film is the most frightening and most surreal he's seen in at least a decade, you know need to steel yourself. He's right. Here's the best, and the most horrific, movie of this year's Toronto film festival.</p> <p>It's a documentary about the Indonesian death squads of the mid-1960s who tortured and killed communists. But it's also a film within a film, as director Joshua Oppenheimer urges the ageing gangsters to recreate their acts on increasingly elaborate scale (prosthetics, props, drag outfits, soundtrack, location shooting). They grin and mug just as they also take it very, very seriously. A strangulation scene is interrupted by the call for evening prayers. But they return after their ablutions.</p> <p>At first you suspect this will riff on familiar ground, with the main interviewees, former members of paramilitary organisation Pancasila Youth, explaining how they were inspired in both their look and sadism by the movies. The most charismatic of them, Anwar Congo, who has a radical hair dye job a third of the way through in reaction to the rushes, is slightly haunted by his acts, he admits, which he tries to forget with music and dancing. And booze. And marijuana. And ecstasy. Others are scornful of any regret: \"You feel haunted because your mind is weak. It's just a nerve imbalance.\"</p> <p>The frank corruption of politics, the glee of the media (\"One wink and they were dead!\" grins a local publisher), the killers' happy embrace by the government (\"We need gangsters to get things done\", says a senior minister) \u2013 this sheer giddy chutzpah has remarkable cumulative effect. We watch these gangsters (everyone emphasises their belief that the word stems from \"free men\") talking trash to female caddies on the golf course, waxing lyrical about the merits a life of \"relax and Rolex\".</p> <p>Some have criticised Oppenheimer for not interviewing anyone who survived the ordeal. It doesn't matter. We know this was genocide. We know that they'd be likely to feel fairly aggrieved. These men hoist themselves and do more besides. The most extraordinary scene comes during one of the recreations. One of Anwar's neighbours, who is moonlighting as the victim, laughingly suggests they use in the film a story that he has. It's of a man \u2013 ok, it's his stepfather, he says \u2013 who was dragged from his bed at 3am by the death squad, to the sound of the screams of his wife and children (that's him, he laughs, that's me!). The next day they found his body beneath a barrel and then buried it by the side of the road, \"like a goat\", so frightened were they that they too would be taken. The percolation of reaction among the men listening is the most compelling thing you'll ever seen.</p> <p>It's often said of documentaries that they deserve to have as wide an audience as possible. This doesn't deserve; it demands \u2013 not for what it says about present-day Indonesia or even about its former horrors. But because almost every frame is astonishing.</p>",
  "<p>In Jamaica <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/clover-graham-obituary\" title=\"\">Clover Graham</a> was the eyes and ears of the United Nations refugee agency. As honorary liaison for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), her passion for justice and human rights filled a needed gap in the legal infrastructure in Jamaica. She not only advocated for and counseled asylum seekers, assisted with refugee status and resettlement procedures but she also kept tabs on how refugee families were doing and helped instill a sense of safety and community.</p> <p>\"To all who knew her, Clover was a selfless humanitarian, a passionate human rights activist, a leader who constantly inspired others to take action, combining her legal expertise and intellectual depth with human kindness,\" wrote the high commissioner for refugees, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in an all staff announcement about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19338826\" title=\"\">Clover's murder</a> last month.</p> <p>Before her untimely death on August 18th, Clover was a dedicated law professor who contributed to the development of the legal aid system in Jamaica. From her days with Brixton Black Women's Centre to her work with refugees, Clover never gave up advocating for those in need of legal assistance.</p> <p>From 1998 Clover worked on behalf of UNHCR with a group of Haitian refugees who fled political violence associated with the coup d'etat that ousted President Aristide in 1991 and his return to power in 1994. Like all refugees, they feared for their lives and sought safety on the shores of Jamaica. Clover worked with the authorities to make refuge possible. At the time of her murder, she was in the process of advocating for the naturalisation of over a dozen Haitian refugees.</p> <p>Clover made it her personal mission to ensure no refugee or asylum seeker was left without protection. This is how she met a former child soldier from Sierra Leone. Clover advocated that this young refugee be moved from Trinidad to Kingston, Jamaica, so he could pursue his musical education. Like so many people Clover assisted, she welcomed him into her extended family.</p> <p>In 2007 Clover's son, Taiwo, and his girlfriend were murdered. Shortly following this horrible loss Clover continued her dedicated and inspired work with UNHCR finding solace in seeking justice for refugees. Clover was also a UK citizen and could have lived a more comfortable life but she stood by her country with its grand beauty and devastating weaknesses.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/homicide.html\" title=\"\">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a>, Jamaica has the highest murder rate in the Caribbean. In 2011, of the thousands of murders in Jamaica, 1125 were reported, and few led to sentencing. In the report, <a href=\"http://www.genevadeclaration.org/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2011.html\" title=\"\">Global Burden of Armed Violence: Lethal Encounters</a>, Jamaica is ranked third in countries most affected by violence, behind El Salvador and Iraq. In spite of these terrifying statistics, Clover pursued justice with a single-edged sword working tirelessly for vulnerable refugees and fellow citizens by providing legal aid and basic assistance \u2014 often from her own pocket.</p> <p>In one of the last correspondence our office received from Clover in June, she sent us an article about the men convicted of the murders of her son Taiwo and his girlfriend. The email was titled \"Finally\" and you could sense that Clover was finally at peace after a four year battle she fought to have some of the perpetrators prosecuted. Clover was one of the few voices that rose above and demanded justice for their deaths. She was a courageous person. Following her death, UNHCR is now among the chorus of voices that have taken up Clover's cause and continue to urge the authorities to do everything they can to bring the perpetrators of her murder to justice.</p> <p>While in Jamaica last week we were pleased to learn that the authorities are trying to identify the perpetrators, and that this murder, as well as many others affecting the Jamaican society, will not go unpunished. We hope that as the spotlight turns away from her death to competing demands that the authorities spare no effort until justice is done.</p>",
  "<p>The black flag of the Islamist Ansar al-Sharia militia continued to flutter over its base in downtown Benghazi, but the garrison was nervous, braced for reprisals after the killing of the US ambassador to Libya on Tuesday night. Many in Benghazi say Sharia played a part in the storming of the US consulate that left four Americans dead.</p> <p>At the gate of the militia's compound, a bearded commander dressed in black from head to toe said the talk inside was of two US warships that had been deployed off the Libyan coast. \"There are two military boats,\" he said. \"Everybody is talking about it. I know they are there, what do I need to do to prove it, swim?\"</p> <p>He refused to give his name or to allow journalists entry. When asked about the death of the ambassador, Chris Stevens, he terminated the interview, ducked back into the base and slammed the gate shut.</p> <p>Sharia has been blamed for string of recent attacks on western targets, including the destruction of Commonwealth war graves and a rocket attack on the British ambassador in June. The group was formed early in last year's uprising and its members did much of the early fighting that stabilised the frontline in March 2011 when Muammar Gaddafi's forces threatened to capture Benghazi.</p> <p>Its main base is 100 miles north-east, in the coastal city of Derna, known as the centre of Islamic conservatism in Libya. It was here that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group was formed to combat Gaddafi in the 1990s. When it was crushed, some members fled to join the ranks of Islamists in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The man with responsibility for security in Benghazi is Fawzi Yunis Gaddafi, who is from the same tribe as Libya's former dictator but was imprisoned by the former regime for his political views. Chief of the Benghazi branch of the supreme security committee, the only national military force, Yunis Gaddafi said Sharia sat apart from the security apparatus.</p> <p>\"There is the SSC, and [in Benghazi] there are other brigades that are not with the SSC. Ansar al-Sharia is separate,\" he said. But he was reluctant to close down Sharia without direct orders, despite evidence that Sharia personnel were involved in the night of violence.</p> <p>\"We saw some individuals there [at the consulate attack],\" he said. He even knew where some of the suspects were: Benghazi's al-Jala hospital was treating several of the mob wounded in the fighting. But security forces did not dare enter the hospital because it was guarded by the Sharia brigade. \"There are some who have been wounded, but if you go there the Sharia are around the hospital,\" he said.</p> <p>On Tuesday night Yunis Gaddafi had taken panicked calls from American diplomats pleading for help as they were slaughtered. \"I spoke to the Americans, they were saying please help us,\" he said. His units arrived too late to save Stevens and his colleagues.</p> <p>He said he would have had more men on duty if he had known the ambassador was inside the embattled compound. \"We didn't know the ambassador was there. It was the Americans' fault. If we had known he was there, we would have been earlier.\"</p> <p>Diplomats have in the past muttered about Islamist units such as Sharia enjoying funding and support from Qatar and Saudi Arabia, powerful allies of the new Libya whom the government hesitates to oppose. But Yunis Gaddafi denied this was a factor. He said Sharia could only be blamed if conclusive proof emerged from an investigation.</p> <p>That seems unlikely. Libya's interior ministry said it had arrested four men, refusing to confirm whether they were Sharia members, but there were no signs of an investigation at the burnt-out consulate. Police were conspicuous by their absence and journalists were allowed free access, trampling possible clues into the dust.</p> <p>\"You want to know who controls Benghazi?\" asked a worshipper, who did not give his name, outside the Mishal al-Harem mosque after Friday prayers. \"Nobody controls the streets of Benghazi.\"</p> <p>Loudspeakers outside the mosque broadcast a sermon in which the imam, Suheib, condemned the attack. \"The burning of buildings is not the path of the prophet Muhammad,\" the imam said.</p> <p>It was a sentiment shared by worshippers mingling outside in the hot afternoon sun, and anger was growing towards a government unable or unwilling to take control. The fear across Benghazi is that the jihadists want to decouple Libya from western support, creating chaos in which they will hope to seize power.</p> <p>\"We have the armed forces. We should tell them [Sharia brigade] to disarm or get out, yet the people in charge [of Libya] can't give them a single ultimatum,\" said Khalid Faraj, a Libyan-American businessman. \"What if these idiots shoot a plane down, who is going to listen to us making excuses?\"</p>",

That might sound boring, but when you're watching a middle-aged man shovelling cow poo with half a hundred humans grimacing behind him, it's like witnessing somebody with Imaginary Friend Syndrome having a breakdown. \"It's completely different from what I know,\" says Audience member and fashion stylist Nicholas, overwhelmed by all of the faeces. \"I understand fashion, lifestyle, creating a brand, all those kind of big things \u2026 everything that he's not.\" That's right Nic, the daily cultivation of acres of land and herds of cattle is pretty inconsequential compared to the daily cultivation of one's Tumblr.</p> <p>My favourite bit of The Audience is when The Audience don't fit into a room. On outdoor trips they roam free like gazelle, but lead them into a council flat kitchen and you've got eyes peeping through air vents and Paul the plumber splayed across the ceiling like Spider-Man. Always polite and keen, they stand like a Greek chorus, nodding in synchronicity and listening to one another; in contrast to most group decision-making found on reality TV. Instead of an hour-long loop of the words \"literally\" and \"at the end of the day\", The Audience ask considered questions like, \"What would make you happiest?\" Also, \"Are you being emotionally blackmailed?\"</p> <p>At the end of the week a resolution is reached and it's time to cut the umbilical cord: \"We're going to leave your life, we can't be here forever.\" They then, presumably, get on a really long tandem and cycle off to an oversized house where they curl up in bed together. TV is obsessed with thrusting strangers together in order to highlight aspects of the human condition, and finally this idea has produced positive results. There's a lot we don't see, though. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a mediator with a stun gun loitering in case Tiger the stuntwoman (yes, really) kicks off over Ian's mortgage plan. Or maybe we <em>can</em> all get along sometimes. Can we? Someone answer me! Help?</p>",

What are they convinced about? That they are the saviours of rock'n'roll. \"It's a fuck-you to the grind of everyday living,\" they declare of their new single, A Challenge to the Dark, \"a struggle against the darkness, an escape route to a better place.\" They continue: \"Sonically it's a challenge to the mainstream, lyrically it challenges the apathy that dominates popular culture in the UK. Above all this is a band to believe in.\"</p> <p>The railing against everyone in the world, ever, isn't just isolated to press releases-cum-mission-statements. You should hear their first single, Carry on Suzie, which came out a few months ago. \"Don't know how much more I can take,\" gnashes Skinner in an accent so unashamedly council-estate Scottish it could work for the <a href=\"http://www.scottishhousingconnections.org/HA/Drumchapel-Housing-Co-operative/\" title=\"\">Drumchapel Housing Association</a>.

It's pure style over content, ironic given the \"authenticity\" of the performance and overall venture. It's big, bold, brash, a blare, a blast, a bludgeon, the band determined to prove their determination (and so forth). Hometown is a 70s vision of a town in ruins, with some Glasvegas melodrama, Be My Baby drums, and early-Bono-ish chest-beating. It's so mired in cliche it's almost sweet.

  "<p>Sea ice in the Arctic has shrunk to its smallest extent ever recorded, smashing the previous record minimum and prompting warnings of accelerated climate change.</p> <p>Satellite images show that the rapid summer melt has reduced the area of frozen sea to <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">less than 3.5 million square kilometres this week</a> \u2013 less than half the area typically occupied four decades ago.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice cover has been shrinking since the 1970s when it averaged around 8m sq km a year, but such a dramatic collapse in ice cover in one year is highly unusual.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\" title=\"\">A record low in 2007</a> of 4.17m sq km <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">was broken on 27 August 2012</a>; further melting has since amounted to more than 500,000 sq km.</p> <p>The record, which is based on a five-day average, is expected to be officially declared in the next few days by the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">National Snow and Ice Data Centre</a> in Colorado. The NSIDC's data shows the sea ice extent is bumping along the bottom, with a new low of 3.421m sq km on Tuesday, which rose very slightly to 3.429m sq km on Wednesday and 3.45m sq km on Thursday.</p> <p>Scientists predicted on Friday that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer months within 20 years, leading to possibly major climate impacts. \"I am surprised. This is an indication that the Arctic sea ice cover is fundamentally changing. The trends all show less ice and thinner ice,\" said Julienne Stroeve, a research scientist with the NSIDC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396182754\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347636881754/Arctic-sea-ice-loss-001.jpg\" alt=\"Arctic sea ice loss\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arctic sea ice loss  Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shrinking of the ice cap was interpreted by environment groups as a signal of long-term global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/arctic-climate-change\" title=\"\">study published in July in the journal Environmental Research Letters</a>, that compared model projections with observations, estimated that the radical decline in Arctic sea ice has been between 70-95% due to human activities.</p> <p>\"We are on the edge of one of the most significant moments in environmental history as sea ice heads towards a new record low. The loss of sea ice will be devastating, raising global temperatures that will impact on our ability to grow food and causing extreme weather around the world,\" said John Sauven, director of Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>Sea ice experts on Friday said they were surprised by the collapse because weather conditions were not especially conducive to a major melt this year. The ice is now believed to be much thinner than it used to be and easier to melt.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice follows an annual cycle of melting through the warm summer months and refreezing in the winter. The sea ice plays a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the Sun's energy, helping to cool the Earth.</p> <p>David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: \"The disappearance of Arctic ice is the most visible warning sign of the need to tackle climate change and ensure we have a world fit to pass on to the next generation. The sheer scale of ice loss is shocking and unprecedented. This alarm call from the Arctic needs to reverberate across Whitehall and boardrooms. We can all take action to cut carbon emissions and move towards a 100% renewable economy.\"</p> <p>Ed Davey, the UK climate and energy secretary, said: \"These findings highlight the urgency for the international community to act. We understand that Arctic sea-ice decline has accelerated over recent years as global warming continues to increase Arctic temperatures at a faster rate than the global average.</p> <p>\"This Government is working hard to tackle climate change and we are working closely with our international partners not to exceed 2 degrees above pre industrial levels. I am calling for the EU to increase its emission target from 20% to 30% and will be taking an active lead at the UNFCCC Climate change talks in Doha later this year, where I will push for further progress towards a new global deal on climate change and for more mitigation action now.

  "<p>As all local authorities know, the status quo is not an option. Not that councils have ever stood still in their search for efficiency and better public services. Indeed, Localis would argue that they are ahead of the game compared with the rest of the public sector, but it's clear that tough times are ahead.</p> <p>Nothing new here of course. However, the sector should not despair. Momentum has been growing for years to break down the silos of public sector organisations from local area agreements and long before, to community budgets and way beyond.</p> <p>Local government has plenty to offer the rest of the sector in terms of its experience in delivering quality services for good value. In turn, there's plenty that the voluntary sector, private sector and emerging mutual organisations can show local authorities.</p> <h2>Pushing the boundaries</h2> <p>Shared services have been in vogue for a number of years, delivering significant savings. However, some councils are continuing to push the boundaries beyond the traditional models of shared back office and management, towards expanding out to sharing whole frontline services.</p> <p>London's tri-borough is one example, with \u00a3300m in savings planned over the next decade, but there are others. Such a model will not be appropriate for all councils and shared services are, by and large, not the solution to the \u00a316.5bn funding gap that the Local Government Association expects by 2020, but in some cases they might help work towards this.</p> <p>Councils are starting to think more broadly about working with external partners, too. Moving from procurement to commissioning is something that we've long argued for, as have others, in a move towards designing services in partnership around strategic outcomes.</p> <h2>Time to embrace change</h2> <p>To help meet the unprecedented challenge faced by the sector, such solutions will need to be radical. They will rely on honest, trusting and mutually beneficial relationships, with both residents and external partners. The public sector will need to be more open to giving up control and embrace working with partners of all types, depending on local need and circumstance.</p> <p>The private sector will need to think about long-term, mature, strategic partnerships that offer value beyond management efficiencies.</p> <p>Finally, the voluntary and community sector will need to commit to practical and sustainable solutions, working with commissioners to overcome concerns and perceptions. To make all of this happen, the public sector will need the skills to commission effectively \u2013 council chiefs still think there is more to be done here, despite their experience within specific policy areas.</p> <p>Our new report looks into co-operative and mutual models, new payment options and ways to harness a more entrepreneurial spirit, but the common theme is that there are a whole swath of alternative models of service delivery out there. But that's ok. That's localism. There are plenty of possibilities to choose from.</p> <p><em>Steven Howell is a senior policy officer at Localis, the local government think-tank.

  "<p>Back in 2002, when Tom Cruise could keep his peculiarities and PR under control, he starred in the sci-fi whodunit blockbuster film Minority Report. Set in the year 2054, Minority Report offered, among many things, a futuristic portrayal of retail experiences. In the film, Cruise's character, John Anderton, is hurriedly walking through a shopping mall trying to evade capture. While doing so his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQbVD5hlddk\" title=\"\">eyes are being scanned</a> with alarming frequency. With each scan the glass window he is passing by offers up a personally targeted advertisement (best ad: \"John Anderton, you could use a Guinness right about now!\"). In the ten years since the release of the film many of the computer and consumer experiences envisioned have either come to fruition or are on the verge of what's possible. These experiences are being made possible by combining the capabilities of mobile devices and big data.</p> <p>Last week I had the opportunity to attend a workshop in San Francisco presented by SAP on the very subject of the future of mobile, big data, and analytics. Aptly named <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maribellopez/2012/07/07/the-future-of-mobile-is-right-time-experiences/\" title=\"\">Right Time Experiences</a> (RTE), these contextual experiences take the vast amounts of data available publicly and privately and combine it with real-time information from mobile devices. For consumers this could translate into something as simple as an enhanced shopping experience or as complex as medical services. For businesses it provides the opportunity to engage with clients and products in ways never before possible.</p> <p>A key ingredient to this experience is leveraging the native capabilities of mobile devices. Data from audio, video, GPS, pressure, and biometric sensors can be collected, transmitted, and integrated into a variety of apps on our devices. These mobile inputs maintain a persistent connection to the Internet and provide an almost limitless stream of information. Devices are constantly improving their capabilities. In fact, recent devices have hardware that is sensitive enough to tell when you are moving between floors inside a building.</p> <p>The end result is opportunities that are a breath of fresh air for consumers and businesses alike. For example, the French insurance company Groupama allows customers to start an accident claim, complete with photos and GPS coordinates, from the accident site using a mobile device. Retailer Tesco allows commuters in a Seoul, Korea, metro station to use their mobile devices to <a href=\"http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/16/view/15557/tesco-virtual-supermarket-in-a-subway-station.html\" title=\"\">order and have groceries delivered</a> on their commute home by scanning desired items from a billboard in the station. Experiences such as these provide customers with valuable time savings while granting companies the opportunity to distinguish themselves and build loyalty.</p> <p>What is defined as a connected device can go beyond our common understanding of what mobile is as well. Vitality has a product called <a href=\"http://www.vitality.net/\" title=\"\">GlowCaps</a> that is used on the top of prescription bottles. Vitality GlowCaps flash to remind the user to take their medicine. These caps are connected wirelessly through mobile carriers, like AT&amp;T in the United States, to transmit data to doctors and loved ones every time the cap is removed. These caps allow concerned parties to track whether medicine is being taken according to schedule. They can also refill the patient's prescription automatically.</p> <p>All of these experiences can bring added convenience to our lives, from directions to connections. However, coupled with this capability comes concern that we could be exposing too much personal information. There are apps that push the social boundaries of privacy. For example, the app called <a href=\"http://girlsaround.me/\" title=\"\">Girls Around Me</a> allows users to leverage the social platform FourSquare to see who is in their proximity. <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook/\" title=\"\">Wolfram Alpha</a> aggregates information on your Facebook posts and friends such as age and location. There is even an app named <a href=\"http://ilektrojohn.github.com/creepy/\" title=\"\">Creepy</a>, which is a geolocation information aggregator that takes the data from sources such as Twitter, Flickr, and Foursquare and overlays what was posted and where on an interactive map.</p> <p>The challenge and opportunity is that the greater the diversity of data collected, then the more of a crystal clear outline of who we are can be derived. Taken together, the sum of the data outlines our habits, routines, and daily norms. This data can also clearly show any variations from our routine. This is very powerful data that can be leveraged for life-enhancing experiences. It can also be wielded to gain intrusive insight into our patterns and lifestyle. We are also only scratching the surface in terms of what is possible to collect. As mobile devices become more intimate to our physical being, the opportunity for sensors only grows. Why not track vital signs so you know when you or a loved one are beginning to get sick or taking a turn for the worse? But how much of this personal outline is appropriate for collection and consumption?</p> <p>The data collected is meaningful both on an individual level as well as on a collective basis. Just as deviations from the norm can be used for analysis and functionality on a personal basis, it is almost more powerful when looking at the masses. For example, think of how an indicator, such as the consumer confidence index, could go from its current monthly backwards-looking data point to real time and even predictive stream based on variations of consumer spending that are being constantly gathered. Think of the field day that savvy political campaigns could have with the data collection and analysis capabilities.</p> <p>The collection of so much personal data raises many questions. Who owns this data? The organisations providing the service, or the individual? Is it possible for an individual to opt out of having their data collected? Do consumers have access to their data? Can individuals request to have the data deleted? Who has control of the sale and sharing of your data? The disparate nature of the data across many apps and services makes answering many of these questions a challenge on a global basis.</p> <p>Many years ago, I remember being freaked out the first time I ever got directions from the internet. I entered my address in Seattle on the West Coast of the United States as the starting point and my parents' house on the other side of the country as the destination. Up came turn-by-turn directions to their house some 3,000 miles away. I remember looking at the map and thinking that somehow I was actively spying on them. \"Stalkers are going to have a field day with this,\" I remember telling a friend.</p> <p>Fast-forward to today. We don't think twice about being provided with step-by-step directions from our current location. In fact, giving someone directions could now be classified as a lost art. What once seemed invasive and like spying has become the norm; or as my good friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miljagillespie\" title=\"\">Milja Gillespie</a> said, \"Creepy is the new cool\". As mobile devices allow for a greater breadth of Right Time Experiences to transpire, what is considered invasive, or creepy, today could just as well morph into the norm of tomorrow.</p> <p>So the question remains: are we being coaxed into handing over too much information? Are we the proverbial frogs sitting in hot water and not noticing the temperature rising? Are we trading convenience over concern? Or is it that we have been raised to think too highly of information as it relates to us? Perhaps our information isn't as important or personal as we believe. Is \"creepy\" just us old curmudgeons not making way for the new? On the plus side, if creepy is the new cool, then perhaps Tom Cruise will someday be able mount a comeback.</p> <p><em>Benjamin Robbins is a principal at Palador.

  "<p>The senior police officer under pressure to resign over his role in the Hillsborough operation was fighting to hold on to his job on Friday, apologising for further upsetting fans in comments he made this week.</p> <p>Sir Norman Bettison, chief constable of West Yorkshire, who is resisting calls from the families of the dead and some MPs for him to quit, issued his second statement in 48 hours on the affair after the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said his words flew in the face of the damning conclusions of the Hillsborough independent panel.</p> <p>Within hours of the Liberal Democrat leader's intervention, Bettison issued a statement apologising if the families of the 96 who died had been upset by his remark that \"fans' behaviour \u2026 made the job of the police in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles harder than it needed to be\".</p> <p>The words were included in a statement \u2013 issued after the report was published this week \u2013 in which he made clear he was staying in his post despite the independent panel report revealing more details about his key role in a South Yorkshire police internal review team condemned as a \"black propaganda\" unit.</p> <p>As his employers, the West Yorkshire police authority, began an investigation into the matters the report raised about his role, the storm grew. Asked about Bettison's position, Clegg said: \"His words were ill-judged. That is obvious. After a report like that, to suggest the fans were an impediment to the police operation when the report revealed the truth that the burden of responsibility lay with the police and other emergency agencies was insensitive and ill-judged.</p> <p>\"He will need to react pretty clearly to clarify what he meant. It flies in the face of the basic thrust of the report.\"</p> <p>Within hours, Bettison apologised. \"Let me speak very clearly,\" he said. \"The fans of Liverpool football club were in no way to blame for the disaster.</p> <p>\"I formed this clear view on hearing all the evidence that was presented at the Taylor inquiry.</p> <p>\"The evidence was overwhelming. The police failed to control the situation, which ultimately led to the tragic deaths of 96 entirely innocent people. I can be no plainer than that and I am sorry if my earlier statement, intended to convey the same message, has caused any further upset.</p> <p>\"My role was never to besmirch the fans. I did not do that. I am deeply sorry that impression and slight has lingered for 23 years.\"</p> <p>The Hillsborough independent panel \u2013 which had unprecedented access to 450,000 documents \u2013 uncovered the true scale of the South Yorkshire police cover-up, which began in the hours after the fans were crushed to death at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.</p> <p>Fresh evidence in the panel report showed 164 police statements were doctored, victims were tested for blood alcohol levels and checks were carried out on the police national computer to access criminal records in order \"to impugn the reputation of the deceased\".</p> <p>Criminal charges may now be laid against serving and former officers after South Yorkshire police set in motion a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p> <p>The force said they were reviewing matters raised in the panel's report \"with a view to making a referral\" to the IPCC. Any referral requires them to identify officers and any offences they may have committed. Any referral would have to name officers and alleged offences \u2013 either criminal or disciplinary.</p> <p>Officers and former officers could be investigated for perverting the course of justice by doctoring statements, misconduct in public office and manslaughter.</p> <p>The current South Yorkshire chief constable has said there are 195 officers who were involved in the Hillsborough operation who are still serving.</p> <p>But there was anger and concern growing among many of those officers on Friday.</p> <p>Several serving and former officers telephoned the police federation expressing concern that they might be targeted unfairly in any investigation.</p> <p>Many, it is understood, said the dramatic revelations of the Hillsborough report had led to the trauma they suffered on the day resurfacing. Others expressed concern that they would become scapegoats.</p> <p>Neil Bowles, chairman of the South Yorkshire police federation \u2013 who was a serving officer in the force at the time of Hillsborough \u2013 said: \"The calamitous conclusions of the panel's report have only made the morale of officers which was already at an all-time low \u2026 worse. Every officer within South Yorkshire police then and since will be blamed for the sins of the past.\"</p> <p>Bowles himself was not on duty at the stadium on the day \u2013 but worked as a mortuary officer in the temporary facility for the bodies the following day. \"I worked for 14 hours there, and the feelings I had then have all returned now,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>India's government has opened the country's retail sector to foreign supermarkets, a sign that long-awaited major reforms regarded as vital to relaunch the country's flagging economy may now be pushed through.</p> <p>Several major international brands such as Tesco, Carrefour and Walmart have been hoping to set up shop in the emerging economic power to exploit a \u00a3300bn retail market. Tesco invested \u00a360m in a cashand-carry joint venture with Indian conglomerate Tata in 2008 in order to gain a foothold in the country in anticipation of the law change.</p> <p>Other long-awaited moves included measures to allow foreign airlines to take stakes of up to 49% in India's troubled domestic domestic airlines and a sell-off of state-owned companies. A proposal has also been cleared which will allow overseas investors to buy up to 74% of broadcast carriage services, such as cable and internet TV.</p> <p>The government of prime minister Manmohan Singh, the 79-year-old economist credited with reforming India's economy in the early 1990s, has been under fierce attack in recent months following a series of corruption scandals and a failure to halt sliding growth, tackle a growing fiscal deficit or support a weakened Indian rupee. The <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/government-announces-fdi-in-multi-brand-retail-267499\" title=\"\">local television station NDTV</a> called the move \"a huge signal that [the government] is shrugging off its policy paralysis\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/WorldEconomy/Big-bold-reforms-FDI-in-retail-aviation-allowed/Article1-929952.aspx\" title=\"\">The Hindustan Times newspaper</a> spoke of \"big, bold reforms\". Government spokesmen were unavailable for comment.</p> <p>The new measure to allow overseas retailers into India is controversial.

Currently most urban Indians get their groceries from corner stores, markets or barrows.</p> <p>Supporters say the move - which will allow foreign firms to own 51 % of ventures within India and sell directly to shoppers for the first time - will bring down soaring prices and help modernise India's ramshackle distribution systems. Local stores will survive as they offer services which big retailers cannot match, they argue.</p> <p>A bid to open up the multi-brand retail sector (shops which sell many different brands ) to major international chains - single brand retail is already allowed - failed last year after opposition from regional parties which support the ruling Congress party and public protests.</p> <p>However senior government figures appear to have calculated that it is now worth risking the support of such groups given the potential boost to growth and international sentiment.</p> <p>A provision for individual states within India to decide for themselves whether to apply the new measure together with a demand that around a third of produce is locally sourced is likely to defuse much of the opposition.</p> <p>Swapan Dasgupta, a political commentator, said that the retail reforms would be \"very problematic\" nonetheless. \"If we were still in the good times, when people felt positive, then that would be easier. Now, with the overall mood depressed and retail suffering already, there will be greater resistance,\" he said.</p> <p>In recent months, a series of poor economic indicators for India have rattled markets and threatened a downgrade by ratings agencies. The government waited until the end of the parliamentary term to act. Opposition parties had blocked almost all business in the national assembly in recent weeks in protest.</p> <p>New supermarkets could be set up relatively quickly, industry analysts say, because many international chains already have cash-and-carry operations in India selling to shopkeepers. Dasgupta said that the government had been goaded to act by overseas criticism and was hoping that \"a big inflow of investment would offset the fiscal deficit.\" The Congress party is split between those pushing for a new wave of reforms designed to accelerate private sector growth and those who favour massive investment in major public redistribution programmes to the poor.</p>",
  "<p>Not content with wielding his superhuman powers against archenemies Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom, Spider-Man has turned his sights on Kippa Man, whose dastardly ventures will no doubt shortly be vanquished by the comic book hero.</p> <p>Publishers Marvel Comics have filed a $25,000 (\u00a315,400) lawsuit against a Jerusalem shopkeeper whose large array of kippas, or Jewish skullcaps, include some bearing a likeness to Spider-Man in his trademark red and blue spider outfit.</p> <p>Avi Binyamin, owner of the tiny Kippa Man store in Jerusalem's historic Jaffa Road, was informed this week of the legal action, according to reports in the Israeli press.</p> <p>Representatives of Ivtsan-Netzer-Wolecki &amp; Co, an Israeli law firm acting for Marvel, visited Kippa Man in July after being tipped off that the store was selling unlicensed Marvel merchandise. \"The defendant distributes and sells kippas that carry the plaintiff's symbols in a breach of the plaintiff's rights to the product, including trademarks, the trademarked name, and manufacturer's rights,\" read the court petition.</p> <p>A photograph of a Spider-Man kippa was submitted as evidence of copyright infringement.</p> <p>Binyamin said he was surprised to be singled out for legal action. \"There are 20 stores on this street, they all sell the same thing,\" he told the Jerusalem Post. \"They make them in China. I just bring them in.\"</p> <p>Kippas adorned with football club insignia, the trademarks of well-known beer and soft drinks brands, and cartoon characters are widely available in Israeli shops and street stalls. It is also possible to order a customised kippa emblazoned with the wording or image of the wearer's choice.</p> <p>As well as Spider-Man, Marvel owns the comic characters Captain America, the Hulk and X-Men. Its parent company, Marvel Entertainment, was acquired by Walt Disney in 2009 for $4.24bn.</p>",
  "<p>Japan has announced plans to end its reliance on nuclear power within 30 years, in a historic policy shift prompted by the triple meltdown at the Fukushima power plant.</p> <p>The move to close all 50 of the country's functioning reactors by around 2040 marks a dramatic change of course by a country that had previously championed atomic energy, putting Japan alongside Germany and Switzerland, which also turned away from nuclear power following the disaster.</p> <p>Japan, the world's third biggest user of nuclear power before the disaster, had planned to increase nuclear's share of the energy mix to 50% by 2030. But the country's attachment to nuclear power was severely weakened after the Fukushima accident sent radioactive materials into the ocean and atmosphere, contaminated the food and water supply, and forced the evacuation of 160,000 residents.</p> <p>\"Based on facing the reality of this grave accident and by learning lessons from the accident, the government has decided to review the national energy strategy from scratch,\" read a policy document released on Friday. \"One of the key pillars of the new strategy is to achieve a society that does not depend on nuclear energy as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>The decision comes after two months of public consultations and the largest anti-nuclear demonstrations Japan has ever seen. Local media reports said the cabinet had already agreed to approve the panel's recommendation, with a formal announcement expected soon.</p> <p>The plan calls for renewable energy to comprise about 30% of Japan's future energy mix \u2013 an eightfold rise from 2010 levels \u2013 and the development of sustainable ways to use fossil fuels.</p> <p>In the short-term, however, the shift will force Japan to increase its already heavy dependence on oil and natural gas, calling into question its ability to reach internationally agreed CO2 emissions targets.</p> <p>\"This is a strategy to create a new future,\" a policy statement said, after key ministers finalised the decision on Friday. \"It is not pie in the sky. It is a practical strategy.\"</p> <p>The report says Japan should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 20% from 1990 levels and to reduce energy consumption through greater efficiency by about 10% from 2010 levels.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners welcomed the decision, but said the phase-out should have come much earlier. \"The government's strategy involves a nuclear phase-out nearly two decades later than needed,\" said Kazue Suzuki, Greenpeace Japan nuclear campaigner. \"It also provides clarity for the business community that renewable power, not nuclear, is the future.</p> <p>\"For too long Japan's leaders have ignored their people and gambled the health, safety and economic stability of every citizen on nuclear power, and as the people of Fukushima continue to suffer, so does the rest of our country. This announcement must become law, otherwise it will be seen as nothing but lip service to buy votes before the coming election.\"</p> <p>The report does not specify how the expensive shift to renewables would be funded, or how to minimise the environmental impact of greater fossil fuel use.</p> <p>The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, will be hoping that the decision boosts support for his unpopular administration ahead of a general election expected in November. Recent opinion polls showed most Japanese preferred a phase out over two other options proposed by the government that gave nuclear a limited role.</p> <p>\"We are only at the starting line,\" Noda said. \"Now we are going to begin an extremely difficult challenge. No matter how difficult it is, we can no longer put it off.\"</p> <p>However, if, as many expect, Noda's party is replaced by a more conservative administration after the next election, there is no guarantee that the no-nuclear policy will survive.</p> <p>Japan was briefly without nuclear power earlier this year after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-closure\" title=\"\">all 50 working reactors were closed</a> for safety checks.</p> <p>No restarts were permitted until the reactors passed stress tests introduced in the wake of the Fukushima crisis and gained the approval of local authorities.</p> <p>The move away from nuclear has caused concern among Japan's allies. Japan provides nuclear technology expertise to companies in the US, while France and Britain, which reprocess its spent nuclear fuel, have sought assurances that it will continue to accept high-level radioactive waste created by reprocessing.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-closure\" title=\"\">Noda approved the restart of two reactors</a> in western Japan amid fears that the country would experience power cuts during the summer.</p> <p>He has come under sustained pressure from business leaders not to abandon nuclear, amid warnings that power shortfalls and the high cost of renewables could stifle production and derail attempts to kick-start the country's export-led economy.</p> <p>But some analysts said a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-disaster-new-geothermal-plants\" title=\"\">serious shift towards renewables</a> could benefit the economy. \"A total exit from nuclear is positive for the economy, on balance,\" said Andrew Dewit, a professor at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. \"It incentivises Japan's political economy to focus on efficiency and renewables. Japan lags in both these areas and they offer the greatest opportunities for growth.\"</p> <p>The phase-out will be achieved by retiring reactors, which were built between the early 1970s and 2006, when they reach the end of an agreed 40-year life span. The report said, however, that some could be restarted before they are closed permanently provided their safety is confirmed by a new regulatory body.</p> <p>\"We will launch all possible policy measures to achieve a nuclear-free society by the 2030s,\" the report said. \"Until the total phase-out we will only use nuclear reactors that are confirmed safe.\"</p>",
  "<p>Everyone holds an opinion, even those who are obligated by law or profession to remain neutral. It is human nature. It can foreseeably become difficult to sit by and listen as everyone around you who is free to gives their opinion, some misguided and others even profiting from it, while professional obligations require you to stay silent. Such is the burden, however, of being a professional in a position of importance to national security.</p> <p>This conflict is not new, but the pressures and incentives for breaking the rules are growing. With TV pundit spots, big publishing advances, and organizations such as WikiLeaks providing opportunity and motivation, are western democracies even capable of keeping secrets anymore?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7421144n\">Matt Bissonnette, calling himself \"Mark Owen\"</a>, was a member of Navy Seal Team 6 and took part in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He has written a book that extensively details the raid and has unleashed a controversy in doing so. Paired with this debate are the attacks of <a href=\"http://www.opsecteam.org/\">Opsec</a>, a rightwing political action committee started by other former Navy Seals who are attacking President Obama and his administration for releasing generally similar information on the Bin Laden raid to the press.</p> <p>Both Bissonnette and Opsec have been rebuked by senior military officials at the Pentagon such as special operations commander Admiral William McRaven and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. The <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443696604577645924269918282.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">US government has not ruled out</a> taking legal action.</p> <p>When one swears an oath to serve the country as a member of the military or any national security-related agency, a different set of rules applies immediately. A measure of your personal freedom, freedom of speech, and political participation rights are curtailed. Inductees know this beforehand, are well-briefed upon induction, and periodically afterward. They sign non-disclosure statements to the effect, and laws prevent the disclosure of identified security information. You also know that some, much, or all of what you do will remain anonymous and unaccredited. Matt Bissonnette knew this when he wrote his autobiography.</p> <p>All this is necessary for many reasons, foremost among them being to preserve the dedication to the nation such jobs require. You may be putting your life, or the lives of many others, at risk for the country, and be privy to sensitive information; you should be doing so because you feel a sense of duty, commitment, and patriotism. To allow public servants working in national security roles or members of the military to profit financially or to have an outsize influence on partisan political debate because of what they've done or what they know is detrimental to national security. Allowing this behavior would mean having soldiers and civil servants motivated by the opportunities of fame and fortune, leaving aside the selfless commitment and dedication to duty and country such roles do and ought to require.</p> <p>This larger point is one many seem to miss. It is arguable that both the information in Bissonette's book and the information disclosed by the White House following the Bin Laden raid were not classified or going to get anyone killed. The difference is that the president has the obligation and duty to inform the public about such an important event, regardless of one's opinion of him personally: he is the commander-in-chief. But soldiers or civil servants profiting personally, or even for charity as Bissonnette claims he is doing, by giving their own personal accounts of the facts calls into question his selfless dedication to country and duty first. Allowing this to continue would attract the wrong sort of people with false motivations into military or government service.</p> <p>This has become a problem of late for the United States. Television news channels and bookstore shelves are filled with pundits and commentators who are former CIA agents or soldiers. The gap in time between events and the release of bestsellers about them is getting ever smaller. Many of America's intelligence agencies have lax policies toward private-sector recruiters pulling their employees and some are even <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0110/32290.html\">allowed to \"moonlight\"</a> and offer their services privately while still employees of the agency. These policies have become a problem <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-502223_162-20053443.html\">with intelligence agencies losing many</a> of their top people to private firms after years of training and service. Disgruntled civil servants and soldiers have released secured government information in the media.</p> <p>These events call into question the motivations, independence, and commitment to duty of the individuals who take part in them. Serving in the military or government should be about a life dedicated to protecting and serving the country, not serving one's self by securing a nice paycheck and nice retirement.</p> <p>Many would push back against this by saying that those who occupy positions in the White House or Congress profit greatly from <em>their</em> service, or even the service of others, so why shouldn't people like Matt Bissonnette, who actually put their own lives on the line, be allowed to profit from it? Yet, presidents and congressmen and women should not profit personally from their jobs either \u2013 and their perceived abuse and misuse of their offices to do so is a reason why the majority of Americans have lost respect for these institutions and officials. Overwhelming majorities of Americans still hold a great deal of respect and esteem for the military and intelligence services because they are seen as representing selfless commitment to the country above self. They're not seen as corrupt, as other militaries and intelligence agencies around the world are. Allowing such behavior to continue may put this view in jeopardy.</p> <p>Such events as the Abbottabad raid don't need to remain a secret forever, especially since the fact that the event occurred is public knowledge. It is important to our democracy, history, and society that the public learns what, how, and why events such as this happen. But there should be a space of several years in between. </p> <p>Matt Bissonnette should be allowed to tell his story, but not while it is still such a present event. There are many possible consequences. Detailing such a raid may amount to providing \"open-source\" intelligence for our international opponents. Disclosing details of equipment, tactics, techniques, or procedures that may seem harmless and mundane on their own can be pieced together with other information. For Bissonnette to wait a couple years to tell his story would not have reduced its national historical significance \u2013 though it may have reduced his big-name television interviews or book sales.</p> <p>There is a difference between Bissonnette's book and the disclosure of a crime or \"whistleblowing\". The reporting or disclosure of a felony or fraud, waste or abuse is quite different from writing a bestselling autobiographical book. Whistleblowers rarely profit from making what they know public: frequently, they lose their jobs, and often endure lawsuits or years of abuse afterwards. Their motivation is usually to correct a wrong. Rewards are offered to encourage them to come forward. Bissonnette was not reporting or disclosing some great crime and he stands to enjoy a great deal of positive attention and profit from his book, even if he donates most of the proceeds to a Navy Seal charity (as he has already <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/09/second-charity-refuses-donations-navy-seal-author/56678/\">attempted to do twice unsuccessfully</a>).</p> <p>It's hard to be too angry with Matt Bissonnette: he is a genuine hero who put his life on the line more than once and is deserving of the profit and attention he's received. It's pretty hard to keep a secret, especially when that secret is that you had a part in killing Osama bin Laden, one of those rare events which most Americans will recall where they were when it happened. Members of Seal Team 6, already famous before the raid, will probably never have to buy their own beers again.</p> <p>But what Bissonnette and his defenders miss, and what the majority of his Seal colleagues understand, along with most other members of the military and intelligence community, is that the wider consequences to the national security of the country he risked his life many times to defend outweigh the right to fortune and fame for his bravery, even if it is well-deserved.</p> <p>In order for the sterling reputation of the United States military and intelligence services to be preserved, and the trust placed in them by average Americans maintained, national security professionals cannot be allowed to profit from their acts, even if they go above and beyond duty or what is normally expected. Seeking fortune and fame, even if merited, cannot be allowed to cloud judgment when it comes to defending America. When it concerns our national security, we need those defending it to continue to put duty and country first. This extraordinary selflessness and dedication is what has kept us safe and strong throughout our history. </p> <p>Matt Bissonnette has an extraordinary story to tell; he should be allowed to tell it. But he should have waited for it to pass from current affairs and into history first. That a small group of brave and dedicated men finally delivered justice for their country is a story not likely to be forgotten by Americans anytime soon.</p>",
  "<p>At the Louis Vuitton flagship store on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, the Japanese tourists were jostling over the famous monogrammed leather bags like they were going out of fashion.</p> <p>France may be caught up in the global economic crisis, but there is no sign of it here.</p> <p>Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy is a leader in a still-flourishing luxury goods market and its chief executive, Bernard Arnault, is in the enviable position of being the richest man in France.</p> <p>Louis Vuitton is a French success story, which should make Arnault something of a local hero.

Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The news that the billionaire businessman might head to the land of <em>moules-frites</em> generated headlines, insults, a lawsuit and divided France roughly down right-left lines: those who saw Arnault as a symbol of the \"selfish rich\" and those who saw him as a standard bearer for the tax-bludgeoned entrepreneur trying to create jobs and wealth.</p> <p>Arnault, 63, a friend of former rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy (he was a witness at Sarkozy's second marriage), denied he was planning to up sticks to get out of paying a new 75% \"supertax\" on the rich, one of the vote-winning pillars of Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's election campaign in May.</p> <p>The explanation from an LVMH spokesman was that Arnault was seeking dual citizenship to make \"sensitive\" investments in Belgium, a response shot down by the Belgian authorities who said foreign investors enjoy the same fiscal treatment as locals.</p> <p>Living in Belgium, which Arnault \u2013 net worth an estimated at $24.4bn (\u00a315bn), <a href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg-billionaires-index/\" title=\"\">according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a> \u2013 said he had no intention of doing, would conveniently free him of French taxes on income, inheritance and wealth.</p> <p>However, the mayor of Uccle, a chic suburb of Brussels where Arnault has a property, said the billionaire had voiced his unhappiness with the French tax system even before the presidential election.</p> <p>\"Mr Arnault came to see me at the end of last year, wanting to be domiciled here, to live here,\" Mayor Armand de Decker told the newspaper La Libre Belgique. \"He has a feeling about the policies of his country, which he considers unfriendly to business.\"</p> <p>Was Arnault paving the way to Monte Carlo, the French press wondered. The route to Monaco via Belgium is a well-trodden one: once he had dual nationality, the businessman could theoretically renounce his French citizenship and move to the Riviera principality where Belgian nationals \u2013 but not French citizens \u2013 can live tax-free.</p> <p>Shortly before the Arnault scandal erupted, the businessman had met the French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, to tell him exactly what he thought of the new tax band. A week ago, Hollande went on television to reiterate: the 75% tax band for those earning over \u20ac1m (\u00a3810,000) was on its way.</p> <p>\"There will be no exceptions,\" he said. \"Everyone has to make an effort, play their part. We all have to be patriots. especially them [those earning over \u20ac1ma year].\"</p> <p>A 75% tax band will give France the highest tax rate in Europe \u2013 overtaking Sweden \u2013 and possibly the world (tax burdens are complicated to calculate).</p> <p>Hollande has also warned that households will have to come up with an extra \u20ac10bn to help bring down the country's public deficit.</p> <p>The president, who once admitted: \"I don't like the rich\", certainly has France's wealthiest citizens in his sights, but the French middle class is likely to be pummelled too.</p> <p>As well as the new 75% tax, a 45% band is to be introduced on incomes over \u20ac150,000 a year (up from 41%) and households will be limited to a maximum \u20ac10,000 savings on tax reduction schemes (down from \u20ac18,000).</p> <p>France is also looking to beef up its \"wealth tax\", imposed on households with assets worth more than \u20ac1.3m including their main home. The threshold for inheritance tax has already been lowered from \u20ac150,000 to \u20ac100,000, a move expected to raise around \u20ac2.5bn by 2014, and there are moves afoot to raise the rate of capital gains tax.</p> <p>Even low earners will pay more income tax after the household allowance (the same as the personal allowance, only applied to families not individuals) is reduced from \u20ac2,336 to \u20ac2,000 a year.</p> <p>Hollande is also said to be considering a fiscal law, similar to that in the US, under which French taxpayers would be subject to French taxes even if they leave the country.</p> <p>For Socialists, the 75% supertax is considered the vote-winner in May's presidential and legislative elections. Even though a small number of French people, probably fewer than 30,000 in a country of 64 million, will be affected, it is hugely symbolic for the leftwing president and his administration.</p> <p>However, Jean-Philippe Delsol, a tax lawyer and member of the IREF economic thinktank which supports \"economic freedom\", says the tax is populist and plays on a historic Gallic antipathy to the rich.</p> <p>\"If you are wealthy in the UK, there is no hate. There may be envy and scorn, but there is no hate, real hate like there is in France. We like everyone to be the same and if they are different we detest them,\" Delsol said.</p> <p>\"Maybe it's because we are a Catholic country and have a lot of rural people who don't like the rich, or because of the idea of egalitarianism that came out of the French revolution, or from Marxism that gained a hold in France.\"</p> <p>Critics like Delsol say the tax will halt the \"economic flux\" necessary for growth and will have the opposite effect to that needed.</p> <p>France, like the UK, already has its tax exiles, including the former Victoria's Secret model Laetitia Casta, the multi-starred restaurateur Alain Ducasse and singer Johnny Hallyday, who like Arnault, caused a storm by seeking Belgian nationality. Hallyday, whose real name is Smet, was turned down by Brussels even though his father was Belgian, and instead moved to Switzerland.</p> <p>Delsol believes many more could follow. \"Even Henry IV's minister Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my de Laffemas in the 16th century understood that high taxes kill the total revenues. And there is an enormous risk people will leave the country.\"</p> <p>Delsol said that last year his law firm had dealt with five cases of French people seeking to go abroad for tax reasons. The threat of a 75% supertax tripled that number.</p> <p>\"In just the first four months of this year we had 15 clients who are leaving or want to leave France. And it's a different type of person. Before we'd have businessmen selling up to go into retirement and wanting to go to Belgium or Switzerland, where they don't have to pay capital gains tax.</p> <p>\"Today it's younger people, 40- to 48-year-olds, new entrepreneurs with lots of energy who have already made money and want to make more, which they don't want to have taken by the French tax authorities.</p> <p>\"They are going to Brazil, Luxembourg \u2026 anywhere but France, and that is bad news for this country.</p> <p>\"It's not just about tax either, it's the climate. People who are making money in France are fed up with being despised.\"</p> <p>The office of Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, did not respond to a Guardian request for information about how much income the new 75% supertax would generate. But Hollande and his administration, it seems, are prepared to risk an entrepreneurial brain drain.</p> <p>Asked about Arnault during a television interview, the president replied: \"He should have taken into account what it means to be French. We are a big country, with lots of advantages and history. We are proud to be French. We have to call on patriotism at this time \u2026 to ask for an effort in the battle against debt.\"</p> <p>As the American economist and politician Charles Wheelan claimed in his book Naked Economics: \"France is a good place to be a struggling artist, and a bad place to be an internet entrepreneur\".</p>",

  "<p>More than 50,000 households live in temporary accommodation in England, according to <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN02110.pdf\" title=\"\">government figures</a>, and the number is rising.</p> <p>The figure is a 5% increase from last year and a 2% increase on the previous quarter, though the number of households in temporary accommodation is still less than half the peak recorded in 2004.</p> <p>The scope of temporary accommodation is vast, encompassing hostels, night shelters and refuges as well as B&amp;Bs and short-term housing leased from local authority housing stock, housing associations or private landlords.</p> <p>The term temporary is also used rather loosely, and time spent in temporary accommodation can range from days to years. Shelter research found that 62% of households in temporary accommodation in London <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/66379/Homelessness_factsheet.pdf\" title=\"\">had been living in it for more than two years</a>.</p> <p>Temporary accommodation can also have a detrimental affect on household health and <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/66379/Homelessness_factsheet.pdf\" title=\"\">has been linked to</a> illnesses, including depression, and distress.

Yet the practice is on the increase because of a shortage of alternatives for authorities.</p> <p>Upcoming benefit caps could also pose problems for people in temporary accommodation. With short-term emergency accommodation a far more expensive option than regular housing, plans to cap benefits may leave households unable to keep up with rent payments.</p> <p>So how can the standards be improved? How can the need for B&amp;B accommodation be reduced? What effect will welfare reforms have, and how can housing associations make life more stable and secure for families in temporary accommodation?</p> <p><strong>Join our expert panel from 12pm on Monday 17 September to take part in the discussion.</strong></p> <p><strong>Panel TBA</strong></p> <p><strong>David Hunter</strong> is head of operations \u2013 east region at Paradigm Housing.

  "<p>Business secretary Vince Cable has announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/14/unfair-dismissal-compensation-cap-cut1\" title=\"Unfair dismissal compensation cap to be cut to encourage hiring of new staff\">the direction the coalition intends to take in employment law reforms</a>, and it's a mixture of good and bad news for employees.</p> <p>First the bad news: the maximum statutory unfair dismissal compensation of \u00a372,300 is to be slashed. Although this is only awarded in 1% or 2% of cases a year, if you are a reasonably high earner or out of work for a lengthy period of time this could affect you. The proposed replacement is the lower of either an individual's annual net salary or the national median average earnings which is presently \u00a326,000, although ministers \u2013 not parliament \u2013 can increase this average by a multiplier of two or three. Not many would expect the \u00a326,000 to be increased three times, or perhaps even two.</p> <p>You will also for the first time have to pay to lodge a claim in the employment tribunal, and further payments will need to be made along the way (including when the case is listed for hearing). It is proposed that unfair dismissal and discrimination claims will cost \u00a3250 to issue and a further \u00a3950 to get a hearing date. Such payments are likely to depend on the financial circumstances of the claimant, but it is not clear how this will work.</p> <p>Now the better news for employees: the \"fire at will\" proposals allowing employers to dismiss underperforming staff without any prior process have been dropped. These were <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/r/12-825-report-on-employment-law-beecroft.pdf\" title=\"Adrian Beecroft: Report on Employment Law\">originally advanced by Adrian Beecroft in a report (pdf)</a> commissioned by David Cameron and were watered down in the months that followed to apply only to micro firms (those with fewer than 10 staff).</p> <p>Instead, the government will encourage the use of settlement agreements between employers and their staff, enabling frank discussions about an early termination of an individual's employment to be had without prior process or fear of a subsequent tribunal claim. This would be a voluntary scheme and the underperforming individual would not be obliged to entertain such discussions or agree to a settlement, but it does give both parties the option.</p> <p>The following measures are also due to be introduced:</p> <p>\u2022 Tribunals are to be streamlined to make it easier for judges to dismiss weak cases at an early stage.</p> <p>\u2022 The government intends to work with conciliation service Acas to simplify its guidance on disciplinary and grievance matters which small companies supposedly find confusing.</p> <p>All the proposals are still in the consultation stage and Cable says he is trying to protect the interests of employers and the basic employment rights of employees. But there is little doubt the measure to reduce the statutory compensation cap represents a further erosion of workers' rights in the UK.</p> <p>If you are found by a tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed by your employer (note the word \"unfair\"), why should the ceiling of your compensation be reduced in this way? As the majority of your compensation payment usually amounts to your actual loss of earnings, and your employer is likely to have much deeper pockets than you, this seems rather unfair.</p> <p>The proposals follow an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/apr/06/unfair-dismissal-reform-government-unions?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Unfair dismissal reform divides government and unions\">increase in the qualifying period for making a claim for unfair dismissal</a> from one year to two for those who started work after 6 April 2012.</p> <p>Watch this space to see whether the proposed reforms make the statute books, and whether they will have the desired effect to encourage employers to hire new staff and make it easier to settle disputes at the same time.</p> <p>Do you think the proposed employment law reforms are sensible and fair?</p> <p><em>\u2022 Philip Landau is an employment lawyer and partner in the firm of </em><a href=\"http://www.lzwlaw.co.uk/documents/employment_law.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

  "<p>Discounting photographers and security guards, there were seven people waiting outside BBC Radio 1 HQ on Friday morning, as the juggernaut of Chris Moyles's personality ground to a mutually agreed halt. Three of them were dyed-in-the-wool Chris fans; one declined to comment; three of them were autograph hunters, who hated Chris Moyles.</p> <p>\"Can't stand the bloke,\" a man in his 40s elaborated. \"It's the worst show ever. It'll be brilliant when Nick Grimshaw takes over.\"</p> <p>He came to get autographs from guests, and was disappointed that there weren't any, apart from Richard Curtis. Autograph hunters, I have noticed over time, will never tell you their name. I can see that it gets a bad rap, as a hobby, but if they're that embarrassed about it, they could just stop doing it.</p> <p>A young pair, Adam Philpot, 21, and his nameless companion, also just came to see famous guests who never materialised. \"But that's not all we're doing,\" Adam said, with a nil desperandum smile. \"We'll go to Westfield after this.\" They arrived at 6am.</p> <p>Inside the building, the swansong show was devoted to the team's achievements over the past eight years, eight months and nine days, and the high regard in which they are held. \"Ed Sheeran has sent me a message, saying 'good luck mate, have a good one', which is very sweet.\" \"Scott Mills has sent me some flowers.\" \"We've had 90,000 texts. That's Wembley Stadium, at full capacity. It's amazing, isn't it? When you visualise it like that.\"</p> <p>One of the team, Dom, chipped in near the end: \"I'm proud of what we've done because I don't think anybody will repeat what we've done.\" Later on, from Moyles, pensively, almost audibly shaking his head: \"It's a hard act to follow.\" I wouldn't swear to it in a court of law, because I'm not a regular listener; but I think he was talking about himself.</p> <p>It hasn't been without its trials. \"All the flak that we've taken, I'm not talking about criticism or bad reviews, I'm talking about people writing stuff about the show when they don't listen to the show, we just got through all of it.\" Hang on, there's more \u2026 \"I do think a lot of the reputation that I have and the show has comes from lazy journalists just rehashing old material. Yesterday, there was a really nice piece in the Guardian about me, and they used a picture from 2003. It's little things like that.\" Little things like what, you might be wondering? He used to be 18 stone, and now he weighs less than that. We printed a portrait from the fat years, running the risk that people won't realise how thin he really is.</p> <p>\"I'm the only radio host to finish in better shape than when I started,\" he underlines. \"You certainly don't look like a morning show guy,\" concurred one of guests, dragooned onto the phone to tell him how great he was, from every angle.</p> <p>I don't wish to cause undue distress to his bereft fans, but this was the most mawkish, self-congratulatory, portentous broadcast I've ever heard emit from the BBC. It was carefully humourless, to maintain its respectful tone. Everything someone might say about a breakfast show at an awards ceremony, while the DJs shuffled on the spot and looked at their feet, they said about themselves. For three and a half hours.</p> <p>Paul Swinton, 30, leapt to his defence: \"Would you not brag about it, if people were calling you a fat git for years?\" He started listening when the show first started, but became an ardent fan after an interview with Noel Gallagher during Euro 2004. \"You hear the origins of in-jokes and that makes them funnier. If you listen consistently, you find it's like being in a group of mates.\" I asked him if he was sorry to see the end of this era: \"To be honest, it gives me a bit more freedom to listen to what I want in the car in the morning.\" That's commitment, when you're too loyal even to station surf. Zosia Morris, 23, and Amy Roberts, 24, started listening to Moyles when they were at school. \"We thought we'd come down to show our respects,\" said Zosia. \"It's the end of our youth,\" Amy added, \"We're going to have to switch to Radio 2.\" \"Through school, through uni, through trying to get our first job \u2026 it's like a group of friends talking that you're also part of.\"</p> <p>It's a feat, certainly, making 6.4 million (at the programme's height in 2010, 11.8 million) people feel as though they're in your gang. Part of the appeal of Moyles and his associates was an aura of honesty: sometimes tacit, sometimes open, there was always an undertaking to say exactly what they thought. When what they're thinking is how tearjerkingly proud they are of everything they've done, it grates on the outsider. To the insider, it's part of the charm.</p>",
  "<p>Does marrying a man entitle a woman to use his sperm?

  "<p>The general consensus among most people who went to see The Avengers earlier this year was that of all the colourful superpowered mega-titans on display in Joss Whedon's genre-defining comic-book ensemble, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk was the one who absolutely smashed it. Imbuing the great green rage-monster's alter ego Bruce Banner with a gentle, resigned tristesse, rather than the rampant (and ultimately boring) torment that both Eric Bana and Ed Norton's takes seemed to suffer from, Ruffalo left space for the character's comic side to emerge and fuelled talk of a new standalone Hulk movie.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/01/mark-ruffalo-hulk-six-movie-deal\" title=\"\">the actor is signed on to star in five more films for Marvel studios</a>, many expected that proposition to be one of the first to emerge in the wake of The Avengers' blockbuster success. With the film having passed the $1.5bn mark last month, secondly only to James Cameron's Avatar and Titanic in terms of all-time grosses, execs have been greenlighting comic-book movies like spandex is going out of fashion. As well as sequels to Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and The Avengers itself, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/24/week-in-geek-marvel-guardians-of-galaxy\" title=\"\">Marvel last month saw fit to put the offbeat and little known Guardians of the Galaxy into production</a>. But still, no announcement of a new Hulk movie.</p> <p>Interviewed at the Toronto film festival, where he is promoting his new film Thanks for Sharing, Ruffalo appeared to suggest that Marvel have given up on the idea after both Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003 and Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk in 2008 failed to set the world on fire.</p> <p>\"I think they've done it. I think they feel that they've done that,\" <a href=\"http://splashpage.mtv.com/2012/09/12/mark-ruffalo-hulk-future/\" title=\"\">Ruffalo told MTV News</a>. \"I think they don't really know where to go [with the character].\"</p> <p>If true, this looks to me like a rather admirable admission of failure. The character does seem to need other figures to bounce off on the big screen: all the best laughs in The Avengers featured CGI Ruffalo's no-nonsense, brutal and bombastic entanglements with friends and enemies alike, so perhaps he's better used for cameo appearances in films driven by other comic-book heroes. The Hulk's personality, it seems, only really blooms when he has to deal with other people.</p> <p>Perhaps Sad Hulk, as we'll call him, belongs on the small screen, wandering miserably around small town America to the strains of the 1970s TV series' maudlin end credits theme. Fans of the Lou Ferrigno era will be pleased to note that <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/abc-hulk-television-show-jessica-jones-yman-171924/\" title=\"\">there are plans afoot to create a new show</a>, though Ruffalo does not seem likely to be involved. Have producers made the right call here?</p> <p>Elsewhere in the rapidly expanding Marvel universe this week, rumours abound that Doctor Strange may turn up in Thor: The Dark World (the upcoming Thor sequel). Some reports had suggested that none other than Viggo Mortensen himself might be set to portray the cosmic sorcerer,<a href=\"http://twitter.com/RogerWardell\" title=\"\"> a story emanating from the Twitter account of one Roger Wardell</a>, who has been furiously tweeting rumours about a whole range of Marvel upcoming projects for months. People began listening when his prediction that <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/anthony-mackie-captain-america-sequel-349622\" title=\"\">Falcon would be appearing in Captain America: The Winter Soldier was confirmed elsewhere</a>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Marvel executive Victoria Alonso has shot down any suggestion that Mortensen is involved with upcoming projects, which would, it has to be said, have been a pretty impressive coup. \"We would love to work with Viggo Mortensen. I've been trying that for years,\"<a href=\"http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=26079&amp;count=0\" title=\"\"> she told Worst Previews</a>. \"But I don't know if Viggo is even acting anymore. I thought he wasn't acting anymore. It would be great to work with him in the future, but we don't have him signed, no.\"</p> <p>It's nevertheless intriguing to note some of Wardell's other \"exclusives\". Apparently, The Mandarin will be the main villain in Iron Man 3, and Marvel are seriously considering getting Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts to pull on a power suit in the same film. Wardell also reckons shots from The Avengers will be recycled for the forthcoming TV show on the ABC network in the US.</p> <p><a href=\"http://splashpage.mtv.com/2012/09/12/joss-whedon-shield-new-cast/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+splashpage+(MTV+Splash+Page+Blog)\" title=\"\">Whedon himself, however, this week told MTV News</a> the show would most likely focus on different characters to those who appeared in the film. \"It needs to be its own thing,\" he said. \"It needs to be adjacent but you don't want to do a show where you're constantly going, 'Iron Man just left, but he was totally here a minute ago.'\"</p> <p>The show's main figures will probably not have superpowers, added the Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator. \"That makes them a little bit \u2013 even though they're a big organisation \u2013 underdogs, and that's interesting to me.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/joss-whedon-talks-all-things-marvel-with-vulture.html\" title=\"\">In a separate interview with Vulture, he added</a>: \"The important thing to me is that we know what the show is. We love what it is. It came together very organically, so when we went in to pitch [to Marvel], it wasn't like, 'We're trying to find this because you want a TV show,' it was, 'Check this out.' And that's a good way to walk in a room.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Whedon has already been planning his sequel to The Avengers, at least in terms of where it begins. \"The creation of the team is not the happy ending,\" <a href=\"http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/Entertainment/2012/09/10/20186786.html\" title=\"\">he told Canada's 24 Hours</a>. \"It is the beginning of something that is complex and difficult, and now I get to dig a little deeper. And maybe, while I'm digging, just twist that knife. And that's exciting for me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ready for your close up? A new era begins on Saturday as NBC broadcast the first network television MLS game, and seeing as it's <strong>Portland Timbers</strong> hosting <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong>, it should do the league proud, spectacle-wise. There's also a Cascadia Cup at stake for a Timbers side with precious little else at stake this season, while Seattle will be trying to stay on the heels of a <strong>San Jose</strong> team facing a very winnable trip to <strong>Chivas USA</strong> later that evening.</p> <p>The third member of the Cascadia triumvirate, <strong>Vancouver Whitecaps</strong>, are struggling to get over the play-off line, but could do themselves a lot of favors by beating <strong>Dallas</strong>, while over in the other conference, <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> could do themselves and some of their Eastern rivals a favor by beating <strong>Montreal Impact</strong>. </p> <p>Most of the intriguing clashes are in the East this week. On Friday night, leaders <strong>Sporting KC</strong> host a <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong> side who edged them in last year's conference final, while behind them N<strong>ew York Red Bulls </strong>face a tricky tie against <strong>Columbus Crew</strong> - still the side most likely to crash the play-off party despite their surprise loss to New England last week. <strong>New England</strong> travel to <strong>DC United</strong> on Saturday evening - the first of a series of games that the DC faithful will see as key to stabilizing their faltering play-off charge. </p> <p>One side for whom the play-off race is finally, officially, mathematically over is <strong>Toronto FC</strong>. They're hosting a <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong> side who may not yet technically be in the same boat, but are surely playing for pride at this point. Ditto <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong>, who must travel to the Home Depot Center on Friday night to face an <strong>LA Galaxy</strong> side, who may find it hard to empathize with their struggles - even given their own early season travails. The champions are making their run for play off position and looking comfortable.</p> <p>Also looking comfortable - our cast of fan reps, bloggers, beat writers, podcasters and assorted ne'er do wells, who had a weekend off for the international break, but were rudely interrupted by the excited squawks of the Guardian carrier pigeons outside their executive boxes, demanding game previews for the resumption of MLS hostilities. You can see their game previews below, then have your say in our comments section.</p> <p><em>All kick off times are EST</em></p> <h2>Sporting KC vs Houston Dynamo, Fri 8.30pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>This Friday night, Sporting KC looks to extend its four-point lead in the East Conference against fourth place Houston Dynamo. In SKC's last match nearly two weeks ago, the team came back with a 2-1 win over bottom-of-the-table Toronto FC \u2013 a match not expected to be close, but earning SKC it's fifteenth regular season win. SKC will need to win Friday to match its 2000 regular season win record (16 wins) and to keep on the heels of the San Jose Earthquakes on the race to the Supporter's Shield.</p> <p>Graham Zusi, who played exceptionally well in the second leg of the USMNT's World Cup Qualifiers against Jamaica, and Kei Kamara, return from national duty. No doubt many will watch if Zusi's form will carry into the match against Houston. Houston had four players on international duty \u2013 two with Jamaica \u2013 and all will be available Friday. Thankfully, midfielder Jacob Peterson has recovered from a shoulder injury, and will be available for this match. Don't count on him playing 90 minutes, though. Defender Aurelien Collin will also be back after serving a game suspension as a result of a red card.</p> <p>This is the third meeting between Sporting KC and Houston Dynamo this season. Sporting KC's record is a draw at home and a loss away. In both those matches, Sporting out-shot Houston. In the loss, Sporting played a man short after Peterson was ejected in the 47th minute. Look for Sporting KC to be aggressive on the attack.</p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>The Dynamo won! It wasn't pretty, but it was the last game of a tough stretch that included the added hurdle of missing three starters and a key sub to international duty. It took a stoppage time penalty that capped off a night of really questionable officiating (bad officiating in MLS? WELL I NEVER!) and a lot of frustration, but it was a win and three huge points for Houston. </p> <p>At last the roster is back together and everyone has had a little time to breath, well except for the guys on international duty. Houston needed this after a roller coaster adventure through August and early September, so now there's the chance to refocus and get ready to for the playoff run. This weekend's match against Sporting KC is a big one. This is a team you'll need to beat in the playoffs and if you really want to improve your chances, beat now to try to get ahead of them in the standings. Look trips to KC are never easy but the Dynamo know how to get results there. I think they'll be able to get at least a draw and that would be just fine by me.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs Colorado Rapids, Fri 11pm (Univision)</h2> <p><strong>Josie Becker</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.lagconfidential.com\">LAG Confidential</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The Galaxy form has been much improved as of late, goals are coming fast and furious and the defense has improved tenfold since Omar Gonzalez returned to the club. His emergence with the removal of David Junior Lopes has the Galaxy back line back to where it was last year; keeping clean sheets. The offense has kept up it's hot streak, even with Landon Donovan nursing a knock he picked up in Mexico City. David Beckham and Juninho have stepped up big in the midfield, taking some of the pressure off Robbie Keane up top to create by himself. </p> <p>This weekend the Galaxy host Colorado Rapids, who aren't making the playoffs which means they're playing for pride. That can easily be a trap game, but with the team playing well without Donovan, and the possibility of Landon Donovan and Christian Wilhelmsson coming off the bench (I doubt either of them start) the Galaxy should be able to sustain at least two strong waves (one to start and one after the subs) that Colorado will just have to pray through. So long as the Galaxy aren't looking ahead to the match in Puerto Rico, LA should be able to dust Colorado with relative ease. </p> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, COO, <a href=\"http://www.bulldogsupporters.com\">Bulldog Supporters Group</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>The Rapids were last in action in a home and home series against Portland Timbers. In the first game, despite an assured debut from new signing Hendry Thomas in midfield and Matt Pickens winning save of the week, the Rapids left the Rose City empty-handed, going down 1-0. Therefore it was vitally important we got back to winning ways in the rematch at Dicks Sporting Goods Park 5 days later. This the Rapids did in fine style with a thumping 3-0 win which sent the Rapids fans into the international break full of hope that the poor run of results is finally over.</p> <p>Tonight we head to California to face the Galaxy in a game we must win if we are to keep our slim play off hopes alive. Despite their league position the MLS champions are not a bad team and it will be a very very tough game. One notable absentee will be Wells Thompson, who many Rapids fans will remember marking David Beckham out of the game two years ago. Wells was traded to Chicago earlier in the week and his departure marks the loss of another key member of the 2010 team - the&#xa0;so-called \"thugs\" who won MLS Cup.</p> <h2>Toronto FC vs Philadelphia Union. Sat 1pm (TSN, RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.90minutesofhopp.com\">90 Minutes of Hopp</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>BMO Field was a different atmosphere on Wednesday night than from the last time two soccer teams played there. Granted, the last match was a World Cup Qualifier, but speak to anyone who attended that game, and they will tell you that it was the best atmosphere BMO has had all year. Especially compared to Wednesday, when the only fanfare before the 79th minute goal was in the traditional 24th, when BMO rang with Danny Dichio's name. However, instead of sounding like a rally, it sounded more like a taunt; a bittersweet reminder of the once enthusiastic fans, who are now outnumbered by empty red bucket seats.<br> Simply put, on Wednesday night, Chicago played better. It was no surprise, Toronto has had more injured players than winning games this season and a game so close to an international break was bound to leave some holes. The first Chicago goal was scored in the 13th minute and the follow up right before the half, which was unfortunate, as it came right after a massive save from new-father-of-triplets, Milos Kocic. However, it wasn't all bad; Eric Hassli provided Toronto with their only goal, which woke up a sleepy BMO. With the loss officially eliminating TFC from playoffs, it will be interesting to see if Toronto will bounce back with a we-no-longer-have-to-care optimism against Philadelphia this coming Saturday. With only three more regular season home games (including Saturday), the team owes their fans at least one win. And maybe the once deafening chant of \"T-F-C\" will return to the house on the Lakeshore.</p> <p><strong>Dan Walsh</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://phillysoccerpage.com/\">Philly Soccer Page</a>:</p> <p>Philadelphia Union played to a scoreless draw against New England in their last match on Sept. 1, controlling much of the game's flow but failing to finish their chances. That continued a pattern for the Union, who have scored just three goals during a six-game winless streak. The Union took 18 shots, but they just couldn't find the back of the net. Freddy Adu started at central attacking midfield with Michael Farfan moving to a wing, and the duo proved an active and dangerous pair in one of the game's few bright spots. However, unless the Union's young strikers finish their chances, all the creativity in the world won't matter.</p> <p>This week, the Union travel to Toronto to take on the last place Reds in a battle of the Eastern Conference's 9th and 10th place teams. The Reds are coming off a tough 2-1 loss Wednesday to Chicago and haven't won in eight games. The Union haven't played in two weeks, and no MLS team has played fewer games than the Union this year. A key spot to watch will be whether Farfan and Adu deploy in the same roles, because like a few other Union players, Adu is probably playing for his job next year. They'll face a Toronto defense that looks a bit more stabilized since the addition of center back Darren O'Dea, but make no mistake, this isn't a good team. Each club really needs a win. The question is who wants it more.</p> <h2>Portland Timbers vs Seattle Sounders, Sat 3.30pm (NBC)</h2> <p><strong>Roger Anthony</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>Portland goes into the weekend with one final chance to semi-salvage a disastrous season. By beating archrival Seattle on Saturday, the Timbers can stake a claim on the Cascadia Cup, emblematic of the unofficial Pacific Northwest championship contested by Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. You can make a case that the Timbers are perfectly poised to steal the silverware: The Sounders, after all, have bigger fish to fry, with a Supporters Shield in sight and a CONCACAF match four days following the showdown in Portland. On top of that, if Sounder coaches show their squad tapes of the Timbers' last match \u2013 Sept. 5 at Colorado \u2013 the boys in Barf Green will be full of overconfidence. The Rapids cruised to an absurdly easy 3-0 win. In their short MLS history, the Timbers have fallen behind 3-0 in every match at Colorado, and have scored only once in three visits over two seasons. </p> <p>Among the questions being carried into Saturday's match is whether the there will be revisions to the suddenly stabilized lineup. With an interim coach calling the shots and no hope of a playoff spot, some might expect the season's final months to be a learning lab for the club's young players. Instead, interim coach Gavin Wilkinson has locked in on a back four of Kimura-Mosquera-Horst-Smith, playing them steadily regardless of (wildly inconsistent) results. That will change Saturday, as LB Smith will be sidelined due to yellow-card accumulation.</p> <p>It will be loud 'n' rowdy Saturday. Given Portland's penchant for defensive meltdowns early and late \u2013 and the recent crunch-time wizardry displayed by Freddy Montero and Eddie Johnson \u2013 odds are the Cascadia Cup won't need engraving by Sunday morning.</p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Its hard to complain about another 3 points for the boys after a home win against the struggling Chivas. Two goals from Eddie Johnson off wonderful service from designated players Christian Tiffert and Fredy Montero, respectively. This offense is clinking at the right time, and it appears despite the embarrassment of riches their is a slight chance we might be adding even more to the arsenal with Eidur Gudjohnsen. However the front office has made it known they expect to participate in CONCACAF each and every year which means some silverware is still needed. The Sounders remain tied for 3rd in the supporters shield race and have an away trip against the lowly Timbers to take back control of the Cascadia Cup will help them keep the pressure on San Jose and Kansas City and force them to continue to come away with results.</p> <p>The Sounders are psychologically a completely different team than the last time they faced the Timbers, having gone 7-1-4 since the 2-1 loss at Jeld-Wen with the lone loss a last second defeat against league leading San Jose on the road. The Timbers on the other hand, have since lost their coach, their dignity and their owner lost his marbles. Since there is no pity in Rose City, we'll save the drama for another day and taste their tears after a 2-0 loss in front of that poor Timbers Army that still lack any kind of history that includes winning anything significant. This is once again, their game of the year, since the playoffs are pretty much out of the picture, the only hardware they can obtain is a cup that would give them 2 chances at home against us to get, so salute to our little brothers with special needs across the Columbia river.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Columbus Crew, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p> <p>After the long international break, the Red Bulls are back to business on Saturday, and they've got a pretty clear path laid out before them, even if it's not an easy one. Seven games remain on the campaign, five of which are at home (and the only road games are at New England and Philadelphia, not exactly long flights). New York sits third in a tightly packed Eastern conference, four points behind the leaders Sporting Kansas City. Fortunately New York can control their own destiny with two games against KC still on the schedule.</p> <p>First things first, at home Saturday against Columbus, who hold the final playoff spot in the East and will be keen to solidify that position with a result in New York. But the Red Bulls are still yet to lose at home, and with the team rested will look to climb back closer to the top. The big questions revolve around a packed lineup, including the returning Rafa Marquez. Where the Mexican fits in the lineup with Dax McCarty being the defensive midfielder of choice will be interesting. That is a sterling example of the lineup troubles that have plagued New York all season, and now, they've only got seven games left to nail it down before the playoffs - or even make the playoffs in the first place.</p> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>So, the Month of August saw the Crew go streaking. The Men in Yellow plodded through a grueling schedule of 7 league games in 22 days. It started off with two draws and then four straight victories before the good times finally came to an end with defeat at New England a week and a half ago. It was bound to happen. The boys looked tired, emotionally drained, and ready for a break. And playing on a horrendous synthetic pitch didn't help matters. But, there is a lot to feel good about in that seven game stretch, mainly the new look Crew offense spearheaded by the sublime playmaking of Federico Higuian and finishing of Jairo Arrieta. The two combined for six goals and seven assists in the six games leading up to New England, and just like that the Crew are in the thick of the playoff race.</p> <p>Now, with over a week off, everyone gets a chance to see how good this New Look Crew can be with time to practice and run with fresh legs (ironically, this weekend kicks off a stretch of 3 games in just 8 days). New York is the perfect litmus test. They sit just four points ahead of the Crew in third place in the East. Of the top six teams battling for the playoffs in the East, NY has scored the most goals (46) but have also conceded the most (39) as their Jekyll and Hyde season continues. In April, NY thrashed the Crew 4-1. However, there will be no less than 6 changes to the Crew's starting XI this weekend since that game. This is a whole new team. Can the Crew's new found offensive prowess keep it going, and will a recharged defense be a dominant force once again? Who&#xa0;knows? Let's predict a draw.</p> <h2>D.C. United vs New England Revolution, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.blackandredunited.com/\">Black and Red United</a>, DC:</p> <p>Before the international break, D.C. United just wrapped up a ridiculous stretch of five games in 14 days. Although the team's record during that streak was only 1-2-2, it could have easily been significantly better if not for some fatigue/injuries (the 1-0 loss to Real Salt Lake), unlucky breaks (Wilman Conde of the Red Bulls scoring the goal of his life), and unexplainable refereeing (what up, Mark Geiger). United played well enough to win four out of the five games. That may seem encouraging, but it doesn't mean much when you're looking at the standings.</p> <p>Fortunately, United's schedule is about to get easier, with the next five matches coming against teams that are currently outside of the playoff race. Unfortunately, United may have to do it without Dwayne De Rosario, who suffered an apparent MCL injury during his time with the Canadian National Team earlier this week.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>The Revs have finally made some changes in the back, bringing in Darius Barnes and Flo Lechner, that has allowed the club to play a bit more confidently and press further up the field. I still wish that Heaps would play with more true midfield width but at least this current tactical set up is perfect for allowing Diego Fagundez to impose himself on the game and he has done very well.</p> <p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Benny Feilhaber has hit a new low with the Revs. He played for the Revs reserves last week after only making a late cameo for the Revs against Columbus. I just can't picture him featuring much the rest of the season or for the Revs next year. I expect a trade, and possible the changing of the guard with Juan Toja set to soon make his club debut.</p> <h2>FC Dallas vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>We had a bye for the last game, so not a lot to report other than a friendly against Leon FC that went to penalties and gave us the sight of Bruno Guarda out-backflipping the player who'd scored the penalty before his. Other than that, everyone except Ugo Ihemelu is fit for the run-in, and the Panamanian contingent and Brek Shea are due back from national team duty. At one point in the season this would have looked like a routine game, but now, if we win this, we're one point behind them in the play off standings.</p> <p>Vancouver tend not to do very well when they play us - both times we've played at BC Place we've beaten them fairly easily, so you'd think that at home etc etc. But I've been following this time for too long to get too optimistic. I hope the players appreciate the magnitude of the situation and get the job done. If we beat them the play-offs are attainable.</p> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>I can't remember the last time the Whitecaps won a game, or even got a point. It feels like it's been eons. Amazingly we're still in a play-off spot, and even in a decent position to stay there. Our 2-0 loss to LA away was expected, as we rotated a number of starters and hadn't been playing well for a while. We didn't even get a shot on net, which is starting to feel normal. The one positive to take from the game was that our defence looked solid: Juninho and Beckham scored brilliant goals (1st and 2nd in MLS Goal of the Week voting), but we restricted LA to mostly shooting from outside the 18, and keeper Brad Knighton didn't have a particularly busy night. </p> <p>We're away to our play-off rival Dallas this Saturday. An away game, the heat, and a traveled strike force (Mattocks, Richards and Miller all featured for their national teams) potentially means an impotent attack. DeMerit and O'Brien will have to keep Dallas' renewed offence at bay, and Robson, Koffie and Davidson will have to be careful about giving players like Perez and Ferreira too much time on the ball. Lee shut down the dangerous Brek Shea last time and he'll have to be sharp again on Saturday.</p> <p>What is encouraging is that over the period of their resurgence, Dallas have only kept one clean sheet. Unfortunately that was against us in that dreadful loss in August, but it means that we should have opportunities to score. It's just a matter of whether we can take advantage of those. I'm guessing the heat and our form will be too much to overcome. </p> <h2>Chicago Fire vs Montreal Impact, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Dan Martin</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.section8chicago.com/\">Section 8</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>The Fire returned to league play against Toronto on Wednesday after an extended break. Given TFC's cellar status and the game in hand that the original Men in Red held over several of their Eastern Conference foes, the game was really a must-win. The club did just that, with two goals in a thoroughly dominant first half (and, if I'm being honest, some scrambling to hold on to the advantage despite a TFC goal in the second half). A win on the road is a win on the road, though, and I don't think there's a Fire fan in the world that would look at the standings post-game and not feel good about seeing Chicago listed at second place in the east, just 3 points behind Kansas City.</p> <p>Saturday at Toyota Park presents another golden opportunity to make up ground, albeit against a slightly more threatening Canadian opponent. I'd expect the Fire to start a very similar lineup to those that took the field at TFC, though perhaps with a speedier forward lineup to try and take advantage of Montreal's experienced, but aged, backline. Dominic Oduro has been silent in the goals department for a while now, and this could be his night to end that streak. Oduro has been used primarily as a super-sub since the arrival of Sherjill MacDonald, but I would not be surprised to see him in the starting lineup this weekend. He scored the club's first goal of 2012 in the season-opener at Montreal -- if he can repeat the feat in front of the home fans (and if the defense can shore up its occasional poor positional play) it will help greatly towards another 3-point haul and with a little help, who knows? First place in the East? After the past two seasons, do Fire fans dare to dream big?</p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>After a 2-week break, the Montreal Impact is back in action this weekend, against the Chicago Fire. Not finishing on a good note before the break, the 2-1 loss against the Columbus Crew was frustrating but the Impact is still in the playoff race. With no injuries and suspensions to hinder the team, Jesse Marsch will have an almost full squad and his choices for the end of the season will be crucial.</p> <p>The Chicago Fire is another hot team in the Eastern Conference, showing consistency and a killer instinct to win games. Led by Chris Rolfe, the offensive sector is full of threats even with Marco Pappa leaving to the Netherlands. Alvaro Fernandez is settling in very nicely and the Fire's strong overall play will be a challenge for the Impact.</p> <p>Facing challenges has been the story of the Montreal Impact all season and they have met them very well as the club is still in the playoff race. A strong center back line with Alessandro Nesta at the helm should help the team handle threats in the box. One issue might come from playing 3 center backs in a 4-man defense, something that Jesse Marsch will look at renewing against the Fire.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Last week, Chivas USA attempted to right the ship and see if heading up to Seattle to face the Sounders would cure their recent woes. Despite getting off to a terrific start with an early goal from Nick LaBrocca, the Goats allowed an equalizer and then a late winner by Eddie Johnson to lose 2-1. The loss leaves Chivas winless in their last six games, and only earning two points in that span has meant that any hopes of making the playoffs are long gone. Now, the question is whether they will win again in 2012.</p> <p>The bad news is that Chivas are set to face the San Jose Earthquakes this weekend. Both teams met up two weeks ago, and Chivas lost 4-0, giving up multiple set piece goals in the process. Prior to that game, they hadn't allowed a set piece goal all season, but such is the depth of this team's slump at the moment. Optimism certainly can't be high for a team that allows a massive amount of goals and still has trouble scoring, but it has to be remembered that this is indeed MLS, and there are no guaranteed results in this league. Chivas certainly need to pick up their form for the entire match if they have any hope of getting a result against the league's best team, but this team showed for much of 2012 they indeed have what it takes to get results. The question is whether we will see any kind of revival in form on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>The San Jose Earthquakes are the first team to make the 2012 MLS playoffs, and in the past fortnight, the journey to that destination has been through Chivas USA. The convincing 4-0 home win before the international break was a cool and controlled performance. The Quakes squad apparently found its free kick touch with three in the victory over Chivas USA: one Bend-It-Like-Bernardez 35-yarder, and two for skipper Ramiro Corrales. It's just another example of how this year's team confidence is translating into a change in fortune for a club who had only two goals directly from free kicks in the past three seasons. Spurs loaner Simon Dawkins scored the fourth and several spectacular saves by Jon Busch preserved the shutout. </p> <p>The upcoming weekend's away trip sees Quakes fans anticipating more of the same against The Goats. Bernardez and Chavez return from international duty, where both scored for Honduras. Some shine returned to Wondo's golden boots when he recovered his scoring ways, albeit in an international friendly against San Luis FC (and in stoppage time, naturally). Seattle's victory over Chivas USA in the only match last weekend ensured a playoff spot for the Earthquakes, with the next destination the Supporters' Shield. The Earthquakes have a league high, and club record, 56 goals this season, and with The Goats shaky defense the smooth ride should continue this weekend \u2013 I'm predicting a Earthquakes victory by a couple of goals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings\">MLS Standings</a></p>",
  "<p>There's trouble brewing in Canada.</p> <p>It's difficult to perceive on first glance. In Toronto, the air is clean, crime rates are low and healthcare is universal. Yet an undercurrent of anxiety courses through the country's public discourse and its media; it dominates conversations in coffee shops and university hallways. A volley of recent polarising political developments has led many Canadians to ask whether their country's reputation as a tolerant, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/canada-carbon-emission-targets\" title=\"\">environmentally conscious</a> international peacemaker is suddenly in doubt.</p> <p>A harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants has belied the notion of a country open to incomers. Quebec has elected a separatist provincial government, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/quebec-separatists-election-victory-shooting\" title=\"\">triggering political violence</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/20/canada-eu-tar-sands\" title=\"\">extraction of oil from the vast tar sands</a> of Alberta has proven hugely controversial, as has the marginalisation of the country's First Nations indigenous people. In foreign policy, Canada is increasingly toeing the US line, most recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/08/iran-hostile-canada-severs-diplomatic\" title=\"\">cutting diplomatic ties with Iran</a>. And its Afghanistan deployment has been tainted by allegations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/20/canada-allegations-complicit-torture-afghanistan\" title=\"\">complicity in the torture of detainees</a>.</p> <p>Some, though not all, of this tendency has been blamed on the country's conservative leadership, which gained a parliamentary majority in May last year. The prime minister, Stephen Harper, has tightened immigration policy, struck a hard line in the Middle East and adjusted environmental policy to encourage controversial oil extraction programmes in the country's vast northern hinterlands.</p> <p>\"Everybody knew that Harper would have a different agenda from that of the Liberals,\" said Herb Grubel, a professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University and former member of parliament. \"What he has been doing is putting into effect some of these ideas.\"</p> <h2>Immigration</h2> <p>Canada is one of the few countries in the world that still looks to immigration as a tool for nation-building \u2013 <a href=\"http://maytree.com/policy/research-reference\" title=\"\">20% of Canadians were born abroad</a>, and new immigrants add 0.8% to the country's population each year. Multiculturalism has been a formal policy since 1971; it's taught in the country's elementary schools.Yet over the past year immigration authorities have radically adjusted the criteria for successful applications and cut resettlement programmes en masse. In June, Ottawa provoked a firestorm of controversy \u2013 and sparked a spate of doctors' protests \u2013 when it eliminated all but the most basic healthcare for certain refugee groups. Last week, immigration minister Jason Kenney announced that <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-revoking-citizenship-of-more-than-3000-after-fraud-investigation/article4532222/\" title=\"\">3,100 people would have their Canadian citizenship revoked</a> for hiring immigration consultants to falsify their documents. Eleven thousand aspiring citizens are still under investigation.\"There's a lot that we need to fix pronto, otherwise the message goes out to the world that we're not a welcoming place,\" said Ratna Omidvar, president of Toronto-based immigration foundation Maytree.</p> <p>Since 2006, the <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1147060--canadian-citizenship-rejections-have-more-than-doubled-since-2006\" title=\"\">refusal rate for Canadian citizenship</a> applications has doubled; the number of immigrants from Asian countries such as <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/Immigration-applications-to-Canada-drop-in-Asian-countries/articleshow/13165547.cms\" title=\"\">China and India has halved</a>.</p> <p>Some analysts say the changes point to a deep-rooted, yet widely ignored undercurrent of racism in Canadian society. In late August, news leaked that the Bank of Canada had removed an east Asian-looking woman from preliminary designs of its new $100 bill, <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/canadians-ask-why-design-of-100-bill-replaced-asian-woman-with-white-one/\" title=\"\">replacing her with a caucasian</a>. Chinese groups were outraged, causing the bank to issue a public apology.</p> <p>\"Fighting racism in the States is like punching a brick wall, but fighting it in Canada is like punching a marshmallow \u2013 it always melds back to the same shape,\" said Minelle Mahtani, a professor at University of Toronto Scarborough. \"We live in an ostrich-head-in-the-sand-like denial that racism exists in this country, and yet systemic discrimination is the norm.\"</p> <h2>Quebec</h2> <p>Intolerance is also rife in francophone Quebec, which elected the separatist Parti Quebecois leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/quebec-elections-minority-government-shootings\" title=\"\">Pauline Marois as premier</a> on 4 September. Marois's ascent to power has been shadowed by violence: a man shot two people at the Montreal convention centre where her party was celebrating its victory, killing one and leaving the other in a critical condition. \"The English are waking up!\" the man shouted in French during his arrest, eliciting widespread soul-searching about the depth of the province's linguistic divide.</p> <p>Quebec was already reeling from a spring full of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/canada-student-fee-protest-arrests\" title=\"\">huge student-led street demonstrations</a>. The movement, often referred to as the \"maple spring\", began as a smattering of peaceful protests against tuition fee hikes. But when the then incumbent Liberal administration passed an emergency law to crack down on demonstrators, simmering discontent exploded into full-blown dissent. At the height of the movement, almost 1,000 protesters were arrested in a 400,000-strong Montreal march, some of them as young as 15.</p> <p>Analysts say that Marois is unlikely to hold a referendum on independence \u2013 she is fighting from a minority position and popular support for secession has waned since Quebec's last referendum in 1995.</p> <p>Yet she has invited controversy by proposing measures that would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/parti-quebecois-shooting-fears\" title=\"\">restrict freedom of language and religion</a> in the province. Her promise to strengthen Quebec's French language charter would restrict access for some groups to English junior colleges. Her \"secularism policy\" would ban religious symbols such as headscarves, skullcaps and hijabs in public offices. Yet it would allow crucifixes, which, according to Marois, symbolise traditional Quebec culture.</p> <p>\"There is still a large group of ethnic nationalists who believe that Quebec should be for the pure-wool francophones who founded this province,\" said Bruce Hicks, a professor of political science at Concordia University in Montreal. \"Pauline Marois, out of deference to this more extremist group in her party, sort of pandered to that.\"</p> <h2>Tar sands</h2> <p>Almost 4,000km away from Montreal, the vast plains of northern Alberta province lie at the heart of another national debate. The region contains 140,000 sq km of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil-sands\" title=\"\">tar sands</a>\" \u2013 a mixture of sand, water and clay the texture of cold molasses \u2013 which contain copious amounts of highly viscous petroleum. Over the past decade, technological developments and soaring oil prices have made its extraction economically viable, making it a prime destination for major international oil companies.</p> <p>Critics say that Harper's environmental policy favours these companies over the long-term wellbeing of Canada's natural environment. Last month, Ottawa cancelled almost <a href=\"http://www.ottawacitizen.com/technology/Federal+government+cancels+environmental+reviews+pipelines/7136029/story.html\" title=\"\">3,000 environmental reviews</a> on proposed development projects across the country, many of which involved tar sands oil extraction.</p> <p>The Canadian government has approved a 730-mile pipeline from the Alberta tar sands to the shores of British Columbia, where it will be loaded on to oil tankers and shipped to Asian markets. Environmental groups have launched a united stand against the project, claiming that Enbridge \u2013 the Calgary-based company at its head \u2013 has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/enbridge-canada-tar-sands-alberta\" title=\"\">dishonest about the risk of potential oil spills</a>. In 2010, an Enbridge pipe burst in northern Michigan, leaving a <a href=\"http://www.fox17online.com/news/fox17-kalamazoo-river-enbridge-oil-spill-still-a-concern-to-residents-20120911,0,2076893.story\" title=\"\">still-visible oily sheen on the area's rivers</a>.</p> <p>\"Canada has always been a natural resource extraction country \u2013 it's logging, it's hydro-power, it's mining, it's oil and gas,\" said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, international director at the Natural Resources and Defence Council. \"But the tar sands is such a big resource, and it drew such major players, that it's really reshaped the way the government has dealt with environmental issues.\"</p> <h2>First Nations</h2> <p>Tar sands oil extraction has also underscored an already fraught relationship between the federal government and Canada's nearly 700,000 indigenous people, called First Nations. For decades, resource extraction on First Nations land and chronically underfunded schools have left many of these communities mired in poverty, alcoholism and disease.</p> <p>Gerald Amos, former chief of the Haisla Nation in coastal British Columbia, said that while his community used to survive by catching oolichan fish \u2013 a type of smelt \u2013 in the nearby Kitamaat river, this traditional way of life is long gone. Toxic dumping has destroyed the river, driving the fish to the brink of extinction. Amos fears that the Enbridge project will consume what's left of the wilderness near his home, where the pipeline will meet the coast.</p> <p>\"I think that the big issue for a lot of communities \u2013 one that really hasn't been grappled with yet \u2013 is the cumulative impact of what we call progress,\" he said. \"And that's something that I think communities are going to have to start grappling with very quickly.\"</p>",
  "<p>Broadcasting as Controversial TV on Sky Channel 200, <a href=\"http://www.emtvonline.co.uk/home.php\" title=\"\">Edge Media</a> is a platform for alternative viewpoints, the kind the government and orthodox media don't want you to know about. But how much truth can a man take? I've been ordered by the Guardian to sit in the full beam of its transmissions for 24 consecutive hours, and report my findings. I don't have Sky, so I went to my friend Matt's house.</p> <p><strong>12:00</strong> A squashed-looking man called Theo Chalmers is talking quite vaguely about aliens. At noon. But that's okay. I expect you get your news from the Guardian, because you can only handle truth that's been wrung through a mung bean. Theo and I can handle the harder stuff.</p> <p><strong>13:00</strong> A woman interviews a man on an Essex park bench about how he used to psychokinetically electrify his dinner money, like Matilda. Dog-walkers pass them, uninterested. I look out of the window at what I suspect could be the last sunny day of the year.</p> <p><strong>15:00</strong> The crap graphics of the Edge Media ident are revealing. Satellites hover over pyramids, revealing their third eye, matching a tablet in an Mayan temple, where some UFOs watch, er, a T-Rex roaring at a pharaoh. The shroud of Turin floats through space to the dark side of the moon where, reflected in an astronaut's visor is \u2026 well, I can't actually make it out. It's truth-shaped, though.</p> <p><strong>17:00</strong> Democracy Now! would be an energising call to arms against injustice. Unfortunately this is Democracy Now, no exclamation mark, a tedious look at what's happening in democracy now: for which read US politics (Michelle Obama: that's what's happening). Where are the nutcases?</p> <p><strong>18:00</strong> There are only three adverts on this station, and the repetition is doing my nut. The<a href=\"http://esotericagenda.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> Esoteric Agenda</a> convention in Manchester (an Ideal Homes expo for radical malcontents) is trailed with trance music and the catchy tagline \"Art Sex Attention Prisms\" alongside an epilepsy-inducing pick'n'mix of Vitruvian Men, eyeballs and triangles. Uncensored Magazine's spot runs along similarly hysterical lines, screaming MARTIAL LAW UPDATE, and WHAT YOUR DOCTOR WILL NEVER TELL YOU, and WAS FUKUSHIMA A FALSE FLAG OPERATION? There are holistic adverts for special salt, and the rest of the unfilled advertising time is given over to galleries of crop circles. Crop circles are so boring.</p> <p><strong>19:30</strong> More Yank malaise, this time following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy-movement\" title=\"\">Occupy</a> movement. There's also a section reassuring us that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange\" title=\"\">Julian Assange</a> is safe in the Ecuadorian embassy. My friend Matt weighs in: \"Yeah, but it's not a very nice embassy. Have you been in the Moroccan ambassador's house down the road? It's like walking into the 70s.\"</p> <p><strong>20:00</strong> Now things are getting interesting: it's The Light And Energy Show. Filmed cheaply in a breezeblock basement, a lady who could be Vanessa Feltz interviews a man called <a href=\"http://www.nickashron.com/\" title=\"\">Nick Ashron</a>. Ashron is a luscious mullet in a brocaded greatcoat who sketches people's spirit guides. It's not an interview so much as a monologue of self-regard punctuated with simpers. \"I heard about this Jesus and thought, 'I want to do something like that.'\" Nick's drawings all look like Legolas. \"I didn't know whether to pursue my music or my healing. Eventually I released a CD of healing music.\" Matt leaves the room and doesn't come back.</p> <p><strong>21:00 </strong>Red Zone. Four actors, including Christopher Ellison from The Bill and Yvette the waitress from 'Allo 'Allo! are sitting on red sofas in a darkened room, discussing topics selected entirely at random. Jack Marsden, who's been in Heartbeat, announces: \"We have two legs and a mouth to perambulate the cock and balls around. We don't think for ourselves.\" DCI Burnside is even better value: \"I wasn't a hippy, although I got a lot of free love in the 60s.\" \"I had to do a Welsh accent in a soft porn movie in the 70s\" \"I'm closer to death than any of you.\" The topics all veer quickly toward sex. 'Was there sex addiction in the time of Taoism, Jack? 'I don't know, I wasn't there.' This is almost certainly the best programme I've ever seen. \"Kids are evil!\" says Yvette.</p> <p><strong>23:00</strong> I've got a headache, but things are hotting up now. Nick Ashron is back with his own show: Lightworker's Guide To The Galaxy in association with Starship Pegasus. He's still dressed as a pirate, but has added clanking amulets and a rigatoni choker to the mix. He's avidly reviewing a book called How To Become A Money Magnet.</p> <p><strong>00:00</strong> On the stroke of midnight, a man who looks like Ronnie Barker in Open All Hours stands in front of a pinboard and talks at me about the New World Order and the cabals who manipulate our governments and media (FYI \u2013 The Illuminati, Majestic 12 and Committee of 300; you're welcome). \"My wife Wanda and a lady from Wales assembled this factboard about the dark forces with info from the higher orders,\" Ronnie attributes, \"whom I suspect were the Galactic Federation of Light.\" I'm starting to feel quite sad.</p> <p><strong>01:00</strong> There's a break for Teleshopping, but I want the truth, not trinkets. I log on to Edge Media's Video On Demand service to hear a prominent activist equating Israel's treatment of the Palestinian people with Nazi Germany.</p> <p><strong>02:00</strong> Squashed Theo is back, talking about the falsification of British history, with a Welshman who looks like a recently exhumed Peter Stringfellow. There are claims that the lost tribes of Israel are Welsh, that Camelot is in Wales, and that the Ark of the Covenant is buried in Wales. Fantastic stuff. There's a CGI rendering of the Ark, which looks like something Kanye West might keep a woman in. I realise everyone on this station has long hair. The men have very long hair. The women look like saloukis. I'm blinking slower than Lauren Bacall and suspect I have bedsores.</p> <p><strong>04:00</strong> I'm nodding in and out of consciousness like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ozzyosbourne\" title=\"\">Ozzy Osbourne</a> now; I have no recollection of this time, and my notes look like an ebbing cardiogram.</p> <p><strong>06:00</strong> I snap back to \"reality\" with On The Edge, wherein the eccentrically named Alex:g delves the sinister goings-on behind small court cases. For a show that swims in muddy water, he has the looks and na\u00efve credulity of Murray from Flight Of The Conchords. \"You shouldn't have to pay for your own lie-detector test. That's terrible.\" Chaining doughnuts, my blood sugar level is up and down like a service elevator freighted with type 2 diabetes.</p> <p><strong>07:00</strong> The low-quality titles to Now That's Weird depict cartoon electricity crackling between the menhirs of Stonehenge. The guest's chortling condescension and eager cynicism suggest he's unimpressed with the raft of crackpot bullcrap suggested by \"ordinary\" members of the public, but not because they're obviously wrong. His air of \"Yes, I already predicted that and have Google image searched the evidence already\" superiority make him sound like a bellend. He's a paranoid without portfolio.</p> <p><strong>08:00</strong> Nick Ashron is back again, interviewing yet another business consultant. The backs of my eyeballs itch and my scalp crawls.</p> <p><strong>09:55 </strong>Bridging Heaven &amp; Earth: a lantern-jawed US hippy presents a sort of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCI5ig9QawU\" title=\"\">Take Hart</a> for acid casualties. A viewer sends in a picture of a rainbow octopus reaching for some lightning, which briefly makes me cry. Then there's Tuvan throat singing and an instrumental from Wolfrobe, which makes me go and sit on the toilet for 25 minutes.</p> <p><strong>12:00</strong> My body, drained of sensation, registers no triumph as I reach the 24-hour mark. I have bad breath and tinnitus. On-screen, Theo is talking about the afterlife. Apparently the body floods with glutamate during near-death experiences. \"You could have a mystical experience after a Chinese meal.\"</p> <p><strong>THE END</strong> In a heap, I reflect on what I've learned from my foray into the frontiers of truth. This station's bifurcation into paranoid conspiracy theory and New Age quackery is not as jarring as it first appears: both are wholesale rejections of mainstream society, retreats into deep cynicism on one hand, and naive optimism on the other. Concerns about the abuses of government, corporations, the surveillance society and energy crisis are not marginal any more, although \u2013 as with any amateur choir \u2013 it's the strangest voices that stand out. I've been judging their hairstyles, rudimentary CGI and fixed-camera shots, suggestive of lonely bunker-babble. Maybe I'm just tired but perhaps some truth is buried down there with them. After all, \"a paranoid is someone who knows a little of what's going on\", according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/williamburroughs\" title=\"\">William Burroughs</a>. What's more, I've worked in a newsroom, and can personally attest that they <em>are </em>run by lizard kings. They actually keep the editors on human leashes. It's sick.</p>",
  "<p>The magazine that published topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge is breaking strict French privacy laws but is likely to be willing to take the risk for the boost in sales.</p> <p>Privacy laws in France are considered to be among the most robust in the world, with leading politicians regularly using courts to prevent the publication of embarrassing photos that would be innocuous by the standards of British tabloids.</p> <p>Yet the French also have form in targeting British royals. Twenty years ago there was a war among British tabloids after the then Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, was pictured topless with an American businessman sucking her toes.</p> <p>And in 1994 paparazzi took pictures of Prince Charles standing naked on the balcony of a French chateau in a set of photos published by the German tabloid Bild.</p> <p>Thomas Roussineau, who specialises in privacy law, said that the French magazine Closer had undoubtedly broken the country's privacy laws by publishing photos of the duchess on holiday in Provence.</p> <p>\"It is totally forbidden,\" he said. \"The castle is not the street, it is in a private place. And they are intimate pictures.\"</p> <p>But he said it was likely that the magazine had weighed the potential fine against the revenue the photos would generate. \"[The fine] be a very small part of the revenue they will have from these pictures,\" Roussineau said.</p> <p>Closer's editor-in-chief defended her decision to publish. Laurence Pieau described the photos as a \"beautiful series\" that showed a couple in love and were in no way degrading.</p> <p>French privacy laws are stricter than in the UK and have often favoured public officials trying to protect their secrets \u2013 the existence of former president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second family and daughter Mazarine was only divulged to the public with his approval just before he died.</p> <p>More recently the French were confronted with revelations about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's sexual proclivities and only learned of the end of the 30-year relationship between the current president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and socialist politician S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal after she was defeated in the 2007 French presidential election.</p> <p>\"The law is more strict here,\" Roussineau said. \"When the Dominique Strauss-Kahn story came out, I had calls from journalists in England who did not understand the reason why it was not known before.</p> <p>\"The reason is that the privacy law is more strict so journalists in France don't reveal this information.\"But Roussineau said the situation was changing. He said the fine would be around \u20ac30,000 (\u00a324,000), compared with far larger punishments previously, which meant publications may begin to take the risk.</p> <p>Politicians, the powerful and the wealthy wishing to protect their privacy benefit from one all-encompassing law in article 9 of the civil code: \"everyone has the right to privacy.\"</p> <p>There are no explicit UK privacy laws, but individuals have privacy rights deriving from the European convention on human rights, enshrined in domestic law by the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>The French laws ban not only the disclosure of a person's private life but also forbid the \"theft of personal image\", which technically bans paparazzi taking photos even in public places.</p> <p>This summer Hollande's girlfriend, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, won a \u20ac2,000 payout after suing VSD, a celebrity magazine which published photographs of the couple walking into the sea holding hands, the state residence in the south of France.</p> <p>The legal intervention astonished the French media as Trierweiler works for Paris Match, a celebrity magazine. The beach photo-shoot appeared on the front page of a number of Paris magazines, including VSD and Voici, which have pledged to fight any legal action.</p> <p>The French laws are considered the strictest in Europe. Albert II, the prince of Monaco, and his family discovered that their notorious aversion to intrusions into their private lives could be big business, netting themselves and their lawyers more than \u20ac500,000 in damages in one particularly litigious year.</p> <p>The French also have laws protecting people whose images are used without their permission to sell products. Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, got a payout from Ryanair after the budget airline used photographs of them in an advertising campaign.</p> <p>In 2011 Max Mosley used French privacy laws against the News of the World, after it published pictures from a video of the F1 boss at a sado-masochistic party with some prostitutes. Because the newspaper was distributed in France, Mosley won. The paper was fined \u20ac10,000 and told to pay \u20ac7,000 damages and \u20ac15,000 legal fees.</p> <p>So it would appear that the French magazine, Closer, has breached the privacy of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and could face prosecution under criminal law for \"fixing, recording or transmitting the image of a person in a private place without their consent\". The maximum sanction is imprisonment and a \u20ac45,000 fine.</p> <p>Gideon Benaim, a lawyer at Simkins in London, said it was time for St James's Palace to draw a line in the sand. \"If I were advising the palace I would say that now is not the time for acquiescence.</p> <p>\"Such publishers should be pursued to the full extent permissible by the law so that they will think twice next time,\" he said</p> <p>However Duncan Lamont, a partner in the media team at Charles Russell LLP, said the palace could face a tough legal battle to prove it was an invasion of privacy.</p> <p>\"It is not quite a private house. The chateau is rented out and there may be debate as to how truly private it was and whether the paparazzi were on a public thoroughfare,\" he said.</p> <p>\"These issues can take years to resolve.\"</p> <p><strong>Lisa O'Carroll and Kim Willsher</strong></p>",

  "<h2>Exhibition of the week \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/renaissance_to_goya.aspx\" title=\"Renaissance to Goya at the British Museum\">Renaissance to Goya: prints and drawings from Spain </a></h2> <p>Spain is one of the great artistic nations of Europe yet art here evolved in a unique and unusual way. It did not look in the 1400s as if Spanish art was going to soar. That century saw the expulsion of the Moors and with them the loss of the arts that created the mosques and palaces of <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Mosque_Cordoba.jpg\" title=\"the mosque at Cordoba\">medieval Andaluc\u00eda</a>. Could the new exclusively Catholic Spain rival the beauty of medieval Islam? It took an immigrant from Crete, the ethereal genius El Greco, to give 16th century Spain <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001017\" title=\"El Greco at the Met\">truly great paintings</a>. In fact, his religious intensity pointed the way to the personal visions that would soon make Spanish art sublime. In the 1600s, the art of Spain explodes into power, from the unrivalled realism of Vel\u00e1zquez (see below) to the poetic Catholicism of <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/francisco-de-zurbaran-saint-francis-in-meditation/27646\" title=\"Zurbarn at the National Gallery, London\">Zurbar\u00e1n</a>. By the late 1700s, raw native originality was blending with European portrait styles in the precociously modern art of <a href=\"http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/painting/spanish-painting/goya-and-18th-century-painting\" title=\"Goya at the Prado\">Goya</a>.

  "<p>The death toll from the fire that ripped through a Karachi garment factory <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/13/karachi-fire-pakistan-workplaces\" title=\"\">this week</a> currently stands at 289, making it the largest number of casualties in a single industrial incident in Pakistan's history. Later, a fire at an illegal shoe factory in Lahore killed 25, bringing the total of Pakistani deaths in industrial incidents that day to more than 300. As the country mourns the enormous loss of life, attention is turning to lax labour laws and the culture of corruption that allows the scant regulations that do exist to be flouted.</p> <p>The facts of the Karachi fire are nightmarish. After the Karachi blaze started, workers were said to be unable to escape because the doors were locked. It is thought that this was to prevent them from leaving their shifts early, though it has also been speculated that it was because of a recent break-in. Allegedly, there was no emergency exit, with other doors blocked by piles of finished clothes, workers had to smash iron bars on the windows to jump several storeys to escape the flames, and unsafe chemicals in the rickety building made the smoke even more toxic. While the cause of the fire has not been confirmed, it has been blamed on faulty wiring. The owner of the factory looks to have gone into hiding. Although Pakistan's constitution guarantees the right to secure and humane working conditions, these twin tragedies have shown this right is meaningless. Ministers have been queuing up to offer their condolences and condemnation, with President Asif Ali Zardari announcing an investigation, and murder charges being filed against the factory owners for their \"utter negligence\".</p> <p>But what exactly is the legal protection for workers in Pakistan? The only legislation on health and safety that exists is the Hazardous Occupation Rule 1963, under the 1934 Factories Act. The act also has a whole section, added in 1997, that is concerned with fire safety. Pakistan is a signatory to the International Labour Organisation's labour inspection convention, which commits the government to ensuring that workers are fully informed about their legal rights, and to enabling inspectors to report on problems that aren't covered by existing regulations.</p> <p>So laws defending workers' rights do exist. But they are rendered redundant by a total failure of implementation. In fact, an executive order issued under the <a href=\"http://www.pbindustries.gov.in/downloads/INDUSTRIAL%20POLICY.pdf\" title=\"\">Punjab Industrial Policy 2003</a> actually abolished labour inspections, with the aim of \"developing an industry and business-friendly environment\" to attract fresh investment. The ban originated in Punjab (the province that is home to Lahore), and Sindh (where Karachi is situated), appears to have followed suit. Unsurpisingly, it was implemented under pressure from wealthy industrialists.</p> <p>Pakistan is a country with an enormous gulf between rich and poor, and an undue amount of influence wielded by a small number of industrial families. The country functions on a deeply entrenched web of patronage and vested interests, meaning that there is little interest in workers' rights and little motivation to change the status quo. Corruption exists at every level, from bribing local officials to overlook an illegal building, to influencing government policy. The civilian regime is weak, and according to labour activists, regulation has deteriorated even further in the past few years along with a general decline in governance.</p> <p>Textiles are big business in Pakistan, a major export that employs 38% of the manufacturing work force and accounted for 7.4% of GDP in 2011. Pakistani cotton is in high demand in neighbouring India, and underpins Pakistan's growing high-end fashion industry. But garment manufacturers claim that in order to compete with cheap products from Vietnam and India, they are forced to cut corners.</p> <p>Putting profits over worker safety is a universal problem, and can be seen in sweatshops throughout the developing world, including in neighbouring India and Bangladesh. But the scale of this tragedy has shone a light on the lax oversight and flagrant disregard for human life that runs riot in Pakistan.</p> <p>Authorities overlooking factory standards, building control, and fire safety have failed at every level. Will this disaster lead to lasting change and an end to the culture of impunity for wealthy businessmen? We must hope that the outraged declarations of politicians are not just empty words to be forgotten once compensation has been paid and the media storm dies down.</p>",

  "<p>Payday lender Wonga has defended the way it carries out fraud checks after a spate of incidents in which consumers found their bank accounts had been used to repay loans taken out by criminals.</p> <p>The lender, which offers loans of between \u00a3400 and \u00a31,000 on a short-term basis at a cost of more than 4,000% APR, makes a virtue of the fact it can turn around applications in just 15 minutes.</p> <p>However, victims say it takes much longer to get a response from the company when things go wrong, and have questioned whether the speed of approvals and the way loans are set up make it a soft target for fraudsters.</p> <p>When a loan is taken out from a traditional lender or credit card provider, the borrower will give current account details for the loan to be paid into. A direct debit is also set up to make repayments: the debit is normally deducted from the same account that receives the loan money. Some banks, including HSBC, insist this is the case.</p> <p>With Wonga and other payday loans a debit card is given for repayments, and the borrower grants the lender continuous payment authority, which allows them to take payments at any time during the month. It is less obvious whether this card is linked to the account receiving the money, although Wonga said it does require both accounts to be held in the same name.</p> <p>One victim, Nadia Mounsey, said she knew nothing about the fraud until she spotted two debits to Wonga from her HSBC current account. On each occasion about \u00a3500 was debited.</p> <p>Another victim, John Young, told us he became aware that his Bank of Scotland account details had been given to Wonga for repayments when he received an automated phone call from his bank asking to verify seven payments totalling \u00a3765 made on his debit card.</p> <p>His sister fell victim to a separate fraud, which she discovered when she received a letter from Wonga demanding payment for a loan she never had. None of the victims had ever taken out a Wonga loan.</p> <p>One major bank said it had seen a \"significant increase\" in fraud by criminals using Wonga over the past six to nine months, albeit from a low base, while BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog said it had been contacted by 40 people who had fallen victim to various types of fraud involving Wonga accounts.</p> <p>Some of the viewers had taken loans with the lender before, and suddenly received letters several months later about new amounts that had been borrowed and paid into different accounts. Others had never had dealings with the firm.</p> <p>Wonga denies it is more susceptible to fraud than traditional lenders, saying it doesn't allow loans to be repaid from accounts not held in the borrower's name. It added that the cases brought to the Guardian were instances of identity fraud, which it said were not unique to Wonga.</p> <p>However, its website suggests that it does allow repayments by a third party in some cases. <a href=\"https://help.wonga.com/help/payments/repaying/paying-loan\" title=\"Wonga: Can someone else pay my loan for me?\">In the help section</a> it says: \"You can have someone make a payment on your behalf. You need to call our customer service team and have the card holder present so they can give authorisation to use their card.\"</p> <p>Figures from credit referencing agency Experian suggest fraud rates at Wonga are double the level seen on traditional unsecured loans. While <a href=\"http://www.openwonga.com/responses/view/fraud-prevention\" title=\"\">Wonga says fewer than 0.1% of its approved loans are confirmed as fraudulent</a>, Experian's figures show 0.05% of unsecured loans \u2013 or five in every 10,000 \u2013 are found to be taken fraudulently.</p> <p>The figures do not include payday loans but, like Wonga's, do include \"first party\" fraud where a borrower uses their own account details but lies about some aspect of their circumstances to secure the loan.</p> <p>According to Experian, fraudulent applications for credit cards is higher at 0.14%.</p> <p>Wonga said it had \"a zero tolerance policy on fraud\", and that cases of criminals targeting it were \"extremely rare\".</p> <p>In a statement it said: \"We take every case of fraud seriously and have every sympathy for the victims of identity theft. Our automated technology is at the cutting-edge of screening out fraud and we achieve roughly a tenth of the fraud levels seen by the rest of the e-commerce sector.</p> <p>\"On the rare instances our advanced security systems are bypassed by criminals, we always ensure our customers are left without any liability and we work with the police to ensure cases are fully investigated.\"</p> <p>In August, payday lender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/09/payday-lender-licence-revoked?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"OFT revokes payday lender licence, but firm continues to lend\">MCO Capital had its credit licence revoked by the Office of Fair Trading</a> (OFT) for failing to check the identity of borrowers and allowing fraudsters to use the personal details of more than 7,000 individuals successfully to apply for loans.</p> <p>The OFT said it was aware of cases involving Wonga, but was not able to comment on individual companies.</p> <p>Mounsey said that although her bank had refunded her within two weeks for the transactions, the incident had caused her inconvenience.</p> <p>\"I was left without a debit card for five days while it was replaced, and I incurred two overdraft fees as a result of the payments going out just before I was paid, although these have since been refunded,\" she said.</p> <p>\"As my name and address weren't used to take out the loan it hasn't affected my credit rating, which is a relief, but it could easily have gone unnoticed had I not checked my bank statement.\"</p> <p>She didn't bother reporting the fraud to Wonga. \"It's extremely easy to take out a loan, yet it's impossible to find any contact details on their website,\" she said.</p> <p>Young, meanwhile, said he had tried to contact Wonga \"as I wanted assurances they would give all the info they had to the police, and because their business methods facilitated this fraud\".</p> <p>He added: \"I was told that their fraud department could not be contacted by phone, and that I had to provide an email address before it would even be reported to them. I was told that 'my' account was now blocked. I told them not to call it 'my' account as it wasn't mine. They told me someone would be in touch in 24-48 hours. I am still waiting.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for HSBC said: \"We have seen an increase in this type of fraud from Wonga, which we think is largely because they allow customers to receive their loan into a different account to the one they have designated to collect repayments from.</p> <p>\"Although we can't comment on behalf of Wonga, it has its own fraud department and we expect they will be looking to minimise this type of criminal activity. As an unsecured lender it is liable for this type of fraud \u2013 our defrauded customers have chargeback rights for any losses they face.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Cath injected herself with heroin, unaware it had been contaminated by anthrax, her wrist immediately began to swell and turn red. The pain was shocking. But she felt only anger and irritation.</p> <p>\"I wanted my usual buzz,\" she said. \"I'd been a heroin addict for 23 years. I knew I'd spiked my vein properly. I couldn't understand why the gear wasn't working.\"</p> <p>So she injected herself a second time. This time her entire arm swelled up. The red turned to purple. It spread up towards her elbow and down towards her fingers. The pain intensified but the drug high still didn't come.</p> <p>It was 2010 and Cath had infected herself with anthrax at the height of the largest single common-source outbreak of human anthrax in Britain in more than 50 years. The deaths spread across Europe: 126 cases were eventually identified, including 119 in the UK. At least 14 people died.</p> <p>This week health experts said a second drug user had died of anthrax in Blackpool, weeks after the first such death in the town.</p> <p>During the 2010 outbreak, everyone in Cath's community knew of the risks. Her needle-exchange clinic had posters warning that heroin contaminated with anthrax could kill and listing the symptoms. News of deaths and amputations caused by the disease spread across the drug users' grapevine. But Cath couldn't care less. \"My eyes slid over those posters,\" she says. \"I didn't think of my body as something I needed to keep alive \u2013 it was a just a piece of skin with veins that I could put drugs into.\"</p> <p>That day, as she watched her arm turn from purple to black, she just felt annoyed that her elusive hit hadn't materialised. She injected herself a third time. Finally, the opiate kicked in.</p> <p>When she woke, hours later, sweat was pouring off her and the pain in her arm was excruciating. \"It still didn't occur to me that the heroin had been contaminated,\" she said. \"I just thought it was another abscess.\"</p> <p>Cath was so used to abscesses that she barely bothered going to hospital to have them treated, not caring that doctors had considered amputating her infected arms and feet on a number of occasions.</p> <p>After three days, however, she was unable to stand the pain any longer. Diagnosed with anthrax, she was immediately put on an intravenous, antibiotic drip \u2013 the only vein to be found was in her neck. She was told an amputation was the most likely option but that death was a possibility.</p> <p>\"I couldn't compute that I had anthrax,\" she said. \"It was the stuff of terrorism and war to me. But it didn't make me think I should stop taking heroin. All I was worried about was that if they amputated my right arm, I'd have to learn how to inject with my left.\"</p> <p>Cath was lucky. The antibiotics killed the infection and on the fourth day, she was given 28 pills to take every day for two weeks and sent home. The first thing she did was to call her dealer.</p> <p>Last week, for the first time since the 2010 outbreak, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction admitted Europe was again in the grip of an anthrax outbreak, probably linked to contaminated heroin.</p> <p>There have been 10 cases identified across Europe since early June. The official advice from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is that more cases are to be expected.</p> <p>\"It's likely that further cases among people who inject heroin will be identified as part of the ongoing outbreak in EU countries,\" said Dr Fortune Ncube, an expert in blood-borne viruses with the HPA. \"The Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of people who inject drugs presenting to emergency departments and walk-in clinics with symptoms suggestive of anthrax.\"</p> <p>How the anthrax found its way into the heroin this time has puzzled police and health experts. In 2010, the contamination in the UK was eventually traced to a single batch infected with anthrax spores from an infected goat or contaminated hide somewhere in transit between Afghanistan or Pakistan and Scotland, probably in Turkey.</p> <p>There are other causes. Heroin can be naturally contaminated after harvesting from soil where an animal had died from anthrax. It can also can be contaminated if infected bone meal is used during the cutting process.</p> <p>Whatever the source, experts are highly critical of the advice that has been given to users in the past fortnight.</p> <p>Often, when there is a health scare among drug users, the advice government hands down through treatment agencies is to use drugs in safer ways. With HIV, for example, users were encouraged to use needle exchanges. This time, however, the advice is simple: stop using heroin and seek help from local treatment centres, which can provide support including substitute medication.</p> <p>That, according to some experts, is impracticable. They say that in an environment where it can take users six months to get access to heroin substitutes such as methadone or Subutex, asking users to stop using is futile.</p> <p>The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse disputes this timescale. It says the average waiting time to get treatment in England is five days \u2013 the lowest it has ever been \u2013 and even quicker in an emergency.</p> <p>\"The HPA campaign assumes users know what they're doing,\" said Mark Styles, a director for the DetoxPlus and Pierpoint addiction treatment centres in St Annes-on-Sea, near Blackpool. \"That's one hell of a presumption.\"</p> <p>Styles has come across half a dozen cases of anthrax in his 16 years of working with heroin users. \"They're not remotely interested in the risk of contracting anthrax,\" he said. \"To tell someone with a drug addiction that they need to stop taking the drug, is like telling me I can't drink water.\"</p> <p>Scott March agrees. An addict for 16 years, he eventually detoxed last year. March knows of at least four people who have died from anthrax linked to contaminated heroin. \"It was scary to be using drugs, knowing it could have anthrax in, but the urge to use is so powerful, that there's no fear strong enough to stop you,\" he said. \"Even if you knew your needle was full of contaminated heroin, the fear wouldn't be strong enough. You can't see past the denial.\"</p> <p>In the unlikely event that users were engaged enough to care about infection, added Styles, they would probably not spot its onset. \"The symptoms of anthrax are minor compared to the horrendous physical effects of taking heroin. Users are suffering so much anyway that they're simply not going to notice any difference,\" he said.</p> <p>Cath was aware she could infect herself with anthrax a second time after leaving hospital. \"The contaminated drugs were still going around,\" she said. \"But my urge to use again was stronger than my will to live.\"</p> <p>Nine months after her anthrax infection, however, she decided to detox. \"I didn't give up immediately after having anthrax but it did make something click very subtly inside me,\" she said.</p> <p>Cath has now been clean for two years, including more than a year of treatment. She has trained as an aromatherapist and masseuse. \"If I can give up, then anyone can \u2013 with determination and good treatment,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I had anthrax, been an addict for 23 years and had got to the point where I was effectively not human: I was rotting, I lived like a rabid, stray dog. But now I love life now and my family are proud of me. When she looks at me, my mum doesn't have anguish in her eyes any more.\"</p>",
  "<p>With the Leveson inquiry in mind, let me explore the implications of the Duchess of Cambridge pictures episode (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/14/kate-middleton-topless-pictures-palace-lawyers\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/sep/14/duchess-of-cambridge-magazines\">here</a>).</p> <p>France has a strict privacy law that is supposed to protect people from the unwanted attentions of the paparazzi. But it appears to make little difference to the country's intrusive celebrity magazines because they accept they will be fined. </p> <p>The fines are relatively small \u2013 usually less than \u20ac30,000 \u2013 so publishers view the problem of whether or not to publish in commercial terms. </p> <p>They make a cynical calculation based on the improved revenue through extra sales set against the amount they will be fined for breaking the law.</p> <p>So let's suppose that some kind of privacy legislation were to be introduced in Britain. Surely publishers and editors would do as the French do.</p> <p>Of course, fines could be higher than in France - and perhaps higher still for repeated offences - but there would have to be a sensible upper limit.</p> <p>Anyway, a new privacy law isn't going to be enacted here. So, in practical terms, privacy intrusions within Britain will be dealt with, as now, through a system of press regulation or, in the courts, through actions based on article 8 of the European convention of human rights.</p> <p>So let's imagine that Leveson recommends a form of regulation that allows for newspapers and magazines to be fined for breaches of a code of ethics (this is likely given the industry's acceptance of enhanced penalties).</p> <p>As with a privacy law, a similar outcome is quite possible. Editors may well risk fines in order to benefit from additional sales. They would also, as now, try to argue public interest justifications.</p> <p>One new form of public interest defence has become crucial (as The Sun showed when publishing the Prince Harry photo). If pictures are published on websites across the world, and can therefore be deemed to be \"in the public domain\", then why not allow them to be carried on British news websites?</p> <p>As Lord Justice Leveson recognises, it is impossible to regulate what happens outside Britain's jurisdiction. Print imported into Britain can be constrained; online material cannot.</p> <p>So let's take another flight of fancy by asking what might happen should the topless Kate pictures go viral, and therefore global. Say they reached similar levels of online publication to the Harry pictures, would Rupert Murdoch allow The Sun to publish by arguing - <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/angry-murdoch-used-harry-photos-to-defy-leveson-8081427.html\">as he did with the Prince Harry picture</a> - that it's all a matter of press freedom?</p> <p>I doubt that he would contemplate publishing these particular pictures, not least because of a possible negative public reaction at a time when the paper is on the back foot over its Hillsborough coverage.</p> <p>Then again, note that the Palace huffed and puffed about The Sun's use of the Prince Harry picture, and then sat on its hands. It did not make a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission, implying that it acknowledged the strength of the paper's argument.</p> <p>Deciding where to draw lines in such matters remains problematic.</p>",
  "<p>\"I realised that if I put the record out, I'd become this guy who was famous for being a miserable fuck.\" Tom Krell is explaining why he scrapped a near-complete album before starting over and making Total Loss, his remarkable new one. Speaking today, at the airy Berlin apartment he's made his base for the summer, the 27-year-old American seems pretty chilled out. He also looks neat and discreetly stylish, which helps when you use the stage name <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/50a5520c-454a-4d5d-ab74-d442b58e7304\" title=\"\">How To Dress Well</a>.</p> <p>Two summers previously, Krell felt less together. He recalls this black period candidly: \"My best friend died unexpectedly; his heart just stopped in his sleep. Then my uncle died suddenly, which blasted my family apart. I went into a long-distance relationship which was totally spirit-rending, and then I had to move to Chicago alone.\" His companion in the Windy City was to have been his best friend.</p> <p>A few months later, in October 2010, the first How To Dress Well album came out. Titled Love Remains, it was difficult to classify. Krell's songs felt soulful and intimate, though his lyrics were often indecipherable. While it sounded like a record made in a bedroom, Krell's music also borrowed tropes from high-gloss urban pop. The contradictions were intriguing; How To Dress Well soon became a hipster favourite and Krell toured the world. But as he recalls today, \"I experienced all this alone.\" </p> <p>When he got home, Krell threw himself into a new record, but it was one that ended up \"drilling down into melancholy\". He says he has \"a propensity towards sadness that is quite intense\", but something in his music showed hope. \"I wrote this song called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYXnW3nwrlY\" title=\"\">Ocean Floor For Everything</a>, which didn't fit with the rest of the album,\" he explains. \"It was still sad, but in a different way. It wasn't about being totally debilitated by loss, it was about going through loss and creating an energy from it.\" </p> <p>After completing Ocean Floor, Krell chose to set aside the tracks he had previously recorded, close to an album's worth. With Ocean Floor as the wellspring, new songs flowed \"quickly and mostly in the order they appear on the album\". Of writing and recording, Krell says: \"It feels like I'm doing nothing. It feels like the opposite of what I do in the rest of my life, which requires so much calculation and thinking and self-presence and needing to be in control.\"</p> <p>The rest of Krell's life involves a philosophy doctorate at Chicago's DePaul University. So far, open-ended deadlines have allowed him both to study and commit to How To Dress Well. He admits this dual lifestyle may seem \"luxurious\", but making Total Loss hardly sounds indulgent. \"I think the album was part of the mourning process,\" Krell says now. \"I was dealing with the initial shock, anger, misery and pain, then working it through in my music. On the other side, I found songs like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smd0kbcuH_g\" title=\"\">Set It Right</a>.\"</p> <h2>'There's a lot of indie R&amp;B circulating: it's ready to be played in Urban Outfitters \u2026 not experienced in any meaningful way'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396165138\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347549739210/How-To-Dress-Well-008.jpg\" alt=\"How To Dress Well\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Andrew Volk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Volk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Set It Right is extraordinary. It begins with Krell's voice hidden behind a thick wall of droning noise. Two minutes later, the wall crumbles, allowing a now audible Krell to deliver a series of messages: \"Jamie, I miss ya; Mama, I miss ya; and Dad, I miss ya...\" Yet while such songs are sad, they're also wistful and affirming. Perhaps unexpectedly, Total Loss is a more accessible record than Love Remains; the production is smoother and Krell's vocals are more direct. </p> <p>In the past, How To Dress Well has been labelled \"indie R&amp;B\" and linked to artists like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/frank-ocean\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a> and the Weeknd, but Krell isn't keen on this. \"I don't understand it. Frank Ocean's album is amazing, but I don't think of him and the Weeknd as my sonic peers,\" he says. \"And right now, there's a lot of indie R&amp;B circulating that's, like, whatever ... I mean, it's ready to be played in Urban Outfitters. [But] it's not ready to be experienced in any meaningful way. There's a lot going on emotionally on Love Remains and Total Loss that I don't see in that music I'm grouped in with.\" </p> <p>If Krell comes over as superior, it's misleading. He's intellectual and serious, but his tastes are varied. He says Total Loss was influenced by everything from Mariah Carey to Ukrainian-Canadian experimental pianist <a href=\"http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/wild-mercury-sound/lubomyr-melnyk-the-voice-of-trees\" title=\"\">Lubomyr Melnyk</a>. But for all his contemplativeness Krell is also ambitious: he wants Total Loss to \"touch as many people as possible\". Later, he plays the Guardian a new track he hasn't quite finished; if released, it could be his most commercial moment yet. Inspired by 90s Europop act Alice DeeJay, it mixes Krell's emotive vocals with pop-trance synths and four-to-the-floor beats. The effect is How To Dress Well In Ibiza. At the same time, Krell says he would \"never change the project in order to get a wider audience. To me, scale isn't the most important thing. I've had amazing experiences playing to audiences of 3,000, and also for just 12 people, singing right into their faces.\" </p> <p>Whatever fate meets Total Loss \u2013 even if it ends up sountracking hipster shopping trips on the Urban Outfitters in-store playlist \u2013 no one who hears it is going to call Tom Krell a \"miserable fuck\" again.</p>",

We need to make a REAL difference to people living with dementia \u2013 not just in the future, but for people like Norman McNamara and the carers who have written so powerfully in our series.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Today's post is by the new care and support minister, Norman Lamb, who has an <a href=\"http://whoseshoes.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/in-the-shoes-of-norman-lamb-minister-of-state-for-care-and-support/\" title=\"\">update on the prime minister's challenge on dementia</a>. He writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are already signs of progress up and down the country. Hard work is beginning to bear fruit. We are seeing a steady increase in diagnosis rates and we have seen a significant fall in the prescribing of antipsychotics for people with dementia. It will take time to achieve all our aims but we remain committed to dementia and by working with health, social care and wider society we will succeed.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Speaking of <strong>Norman Lamb</strong>, Roy Lilley's <a href=\"http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Dr-Deaf.html?soid=1102665899193&amp;aid=n7b5phlO9RA\" title=\"\">must-read morning email</a> for NHS managers shares this interesting archive story. <strong> </strong>Lamb told the Lib Dem conference in 2007, when he was the party's health spokesman, that patients needing emergency NHS treatment after becoming drunk or incapacitated by drugs <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/lamb-%E2%80%9Crat-arsed-drunks%E2%80%9D-should-pay-ae-bills-1322.html\" title=\"\">should be charged</a>, or as he put it:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you get rat-arsed on a Friday night and get taken to A&amp;E where you are foul and abusive to staff, is it right for the taxpayers to fund your life-saving treatment?</p> </blockquote> <p><br>As the Lib Dem Voice site put it at the time, Lamb couldn't be accused of slipping out his policy gently. Lamb's policy proposals at the time also included an elected local health board to give people a bigger say in services a local health contribution to allow communities to raise extra money for local health services.</p> <p>\u2022 More on the BBC's <strong>Trouble on the Estate</strong> programme. The <a href=\"http://unemployednet.org/\" title=\"\">UnemployedNet</a> site, which describes itself as the first free one-stop online support site for unemployed people, says the Panorama programme, and series like Saints and Scroungers suggest \"the BBC just doesn't seem to have the skills to make documentaries about working class life in Britain\". The site's review of Trouble on the Estate says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sensationalist tone was present throughout; a more balanced documentary may gather fewer viewers, but it would be fairer and more truthful without the dramatic music, repeated shots of the one boarded-up building suggesting deprivation that wasn't shown, and lack of factual and statistical context for much of the information provided by those appearing on camera.<br>In presenting the idea that we were seeing all life on the estate it erred towards dishonesty; life everywhere includes positives and calm time when little happens. The closest we came to a functional relationship was a 15 year old who had moved to his Aunt's house a mile away; we saw him with his girlfriend on the swings in full romantic effect. For every workless family we saw, statistics suggest there must be at least two with work, people who are getting up every day and providing, even on the Shadsworth [the estate in the programme].</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 This picture story by photojournalist James Clasper, who describes the \"mouldering mosaic of paper\" on display as <a href=\"http://jamesclasper.com/bread-line\" title=\"\">a London shopkeeper keeps record of the amounts owed by his customers on the breadline</a>.

  "<p>Owing to my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/may/02/ladies-why-you-should-stop-shaving\" title=\"\">aversion to razors</a>, the Guardian has kindly invited me to comment on singer Jessie J's announcement that she plans to shave her head for charity in March next year. On the one hand, I am the right hairy beastie for this job. My xyrophobia is but partial, you see \u2013 <a href=\"http://showstudio.com/project/fashion_fetish/essay_trichophilia\" title=\"\">I've shaved my head twice now</a> and will probably do so again the next time I'm trying to impress someone at a party. On the other hand, however, I feel a bit shoe-horned in, because I hadn't heard of Jessie J before today.</p> <p>Yes, yes, I know. Have I spent the past year under a rock in China with my hands over my ears? Do I go about my life wearing a sensory deprivation helmet? I've already had all this flack from my incredulous workmates and flatmates, so please just find some other way to slag me off in the comments section.</p> <p>Being a partial luddite and partial snob (snuddite?), I miss almost everything that happens in popular culture. Ergo, my snob half wrote a version of this article on the train back from work based on the arsey assumptions that a) Jessie J was a disposable plastic product of the X-factory and b) the internet was awash with hate-monkeys shrieking that if Jessie J shaved her head her vagina would fall off (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/miley-cyrus-cut-hair-why-fuss\" title=\"\">just like they did with Miley Cyrus</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396151235\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347622043089/Brick-Lane.jpg\" alt=\"Emer O Toole on Brick Lane \" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'I've shaved my head twice now and will probably do so again the next time I'm trying to impress someone at a party.'</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I got home, my luddite half worked out how to search Twitter (I'm afraid of Twitter. Look what those <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/jul/31/my-favourite-hitchcock-the-birds\" title=\"\">birds did to Tippi Hedren</a>). And I discovered, much to my chagrin, that Jessie J is AMAZING. She writes her own stuff, and her lyrics are cool; she has a phenomenal voice, and she's outspoken about her bisexuality; she has intelligent things to say, and she looks <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=deadly\" title=\"\">deadly</a>! I couldn't find any hate monkeys at all. Not a single faeces-flinging primate was there in any Twitter tree. Instead, all the birdies were chirping stuff like \"OMG Jessie J UR so BRAVE Im gonna shave my head 4 charity 2 UR my inspiration.\"</p> <p>I hate it when I'm prevented from rolling out a prefabricated feminist diatribe. It makes me all stampy. But never fear! I've come up with a different unfounded and cynical assumption about Jessie J to peddle instead. Here it is. Jessie J isn't really shaving her head for charity. Jessie J is shaving her head because she wants to. Oh we all know people who do it \u2013 people who get you to sponsor their \"charity\" skydive, or their \"charity\" walk up Machu Picchu, or their \"charity\" MDMA-fuelled danceathon in Ibiza. Well, Jessie J is no different. Sure, she's raising some money (mo-nay, mo-nay) for a worthy cause, but she has a far more devious motive.</p> <p>Imagine: you're an \u00fcber-famous super-cool pop star who everyone except me has heard of. You harbour a deep and unrelenting desire (possibly based on a teenage obsession with Skunk Anansie) to see the contours of your own skull. But you are savant enough to know that you live in a world in which a white woman's decision to shave her head is seen, variously, as a sign of acute psychological distress (Britney), of living in an alternative dimension (Sin\u00e9ad), or of having been locked in a basement by a masked man for months with only a scrap of loo roll for company (Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta). What do you do? That's right \u2013 you play the charity card. That way everyone thinks you're brave. No one even suspects that you're secretly a body non-conformist screaming against the strictures of gender normativity.</p> <p>But I'm on to you Jessie J. I know you're excited at the prospect of irreverently skipping across the boundary of acceptable female behaviour, of breaking down learned beliefs about what is masculine, what is feminine, and what is beautiful. I know you want to rewrite the cultural schema of shaved-headed women, turning connotations of prisons, camps and collaborators into a narrative of playfulness, bravery and social value. And I think you're aware that when a woman admired as much as you plays this game, it gives others the permission to do so as well. It gifts women and men alike with the courage to take control of their physicalities, to make choices about their bodies based on individual desires, not blind conformity to stupid gendered bullshit or fear of social ridicule.</p> <p>So Jessie J, if 2013 is the year of the shaved head, why not consider <a href=\"http://www.armpitsforaugust.com/\" title=\"\">Armpits4August</a> in 2014? All for a very good cause!</p>",
  "<p>A City trader recklessly gambled with illicit trades to boost his bonus, and ran up potential losses of more than \u00a37bn at one point, a sum big enough to sink his employer, the global bank UBS, a court has heard.</p> <p>Kweku Adoboli, a trusted and experienced member of UBS's exchange traded fund (ETF) desk in London, risked ever-greater sums in an attempt to conceal his losses over two and a half years before he was caught in September 2011, Southwark crown court was told.</p> <p>Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting, said the 32-year-old took his bank's money and \"fraudulently gambled it away\" in an attempt to boost his status and become one of the elite circle of City traders who earn vast annual sums.</p> <p>She said: \"Mr Adoboli's motive was to increase his bonus, his status, his job prospects and his ego. Like most gamblers he believed he had the magic touch. Like most gamblers, when he lost, he caused chaos and disaster to himself and all of those around him.\"</p> <p>The total losses to UBS were eventually calculated at $2.3bn, or just over \u00a31.4bn. Wass told the jury: \"This colossal loss rose purely as a result of Mr Adoboli's fraudulent deal making, which amounted to naked gambling.\"</p> <p>However, she added, at one point the scale of Adoboli's liabilities to the bank through vast trades, which were not properly hedged to mitigate the risk, reached almost $12bn.</p> <p>\"Make no mistake, the scale of Mr Adoboli's gambling was so large and unchecked he could quite easily have approached and even exceeded the limits of the bank's resources,\" she said.</p> <p>By \"risking the very existence of the bank\" through the scale of his activities, and in the deliberate and calculated way he carried out the scam, Wass said, Adoboli amounted to something quite different to the usual rogue trader.</p> <p>The court was told that the former public schoolboy joined UBS as a graduate trainee in 2003 after completing his degree at Nottingham University. He initially worked in the back office, which maintains records, analyses trades and makes sure accounts are balanced and correct, Wass said.</p> <p>\"He became intimately aware of how the bank's accounting controls worked and would have seen their strengths and weaknesses. He would have known what events triggered the alarms and how to avoid this happening,\" she told the jury.</p> <p>Two years later he moved to the trading floor and in a rapid ascent became a director on the ETF desk. His salary rose to match: beginning at \u00a333,000 with a bonus of \u00a37,500, by 2008 Adoboli was earning a combined sum of \u00a365,000. Just two years later this was \u00a3360,000 \u2013 a basic salary of \u00a3110,000 and a bonus of \u00a3250,000 based partly on the bank's wider performance but also on how much profit an employee brings in.</p> <p>This gave a false picture of his skills, Wass said: \"Mr Adobli's income had risen exponentially during 2009 and 2010 not because he was a genuine top trader but because, as he later admitted, it was during this period that he began to fraudulently gamble the bank's money.\"</p> <p>Adoboli racked up the giant losses undetected through three means, Wass said. First, he often exceeded the official daily trading limit per employee of $100m. He also failed to hedge trades by making balancing trades to mitigate potential losses, an insurance method that also caps potential profits. By doing so Adoboli hoped to maximise profits and thus his bonus, she said. Finally, he falsified data so as not to record his trades properly, often inventing false clients and trades for hedges.</p> <p>Adoboli's reckless manner was like that of a \"martingale\" gambler, a reckless system of betting in which a loss on a position is followed up by a double-sized punt on the same outcome, on the assumption it will eventually recoup losses.</p> <p>Wass said: \"He was certain his prediction of the way the market was moving was correct and when the market moved the opposite way and his bets lost, he simply increased his bets.\"</p> <p>In the summer of last year, Wass told the jury, colleagues started to ask questions about his trading account, particularly one accountant in the UBS back office. \"Each time that Mr Adoboli was questioned he gave a plausible explanation for his trades,\" she said. \"Mr Adoboli was able to draw on his experience of working within the control system to sidestep the questions.\"</p> <p>But on 14 September, under intense scrutiny and aware a number of trades were \"about to hit the buffers\", Adoboli panicked and walked out of the UBS office, saying he had to see a doctor. Using his home email account he sent his bosses a message which, Wass argued, admitted his guilt.</p> <p>In the email, read to the court, Adoboli said he had tried to suppress losses from \"off book\" trades, a number of which were, he warned, still \"live\". It continued: \"I have now left the office for the sake of discretion. I will need to come back in to discuss the positions and explain face to face but for reasons that are obvious I did not think it was wise to stay on the desk this afternoon.\"</p> <p>Saying he took full responsibility for what happened, he ended: \"I am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my bank and my colleagues at risk.\"</p> <p>Wass told the jury: \"You will see, Mr Adoboli's dishonest practices had a measure of success in the early days. He was cheating the system and he appeared to be getting away with it for years.</p> <p>\"On 14 September last year his system crashed like a car hitting a wall at high speed. Due to a series of events that had been building up over the previous few weeks, Mr Adoboli's pyramid of fraud collapsed. He was left with no choice but to admit exactly what he had been up to.\"</p> <p>Adoboli, from Whitechapel, east London, denies four counts of fraud and false accounting between October 2008 and September 2011.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>Prince William is said to be furious after a French magazine published topless photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge.</p> <p>Officials at St James's Palace said \"a red line has been crossed\" after the French version of celebrity magazine Closer published what it described as exclusive pictures of Kate topless under the headline: \"Seulement dans Closer: Kate et William, leurs vacances tres hot en Provence.\"</p> <p>They were apparently taken on the terrace of a guest house during a brief holiday in France last week.</p> <p>The couple were staying in Provence at a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen's nephew, ahead of their diamond jubilee tour of south-east Asia and the South Pacific on behalf of the Queen.</p> <p>Officials who are touring with Prince William in Malaysia said the Duke and Duchess were furious and hurt by the publication of the photographs.</p> <p>They did not know anything about the photos until the magazine's website showed an image of its new front cover with a heavily-pixellated image of a woman with dark hair that it claimed was the Duchess, in a bikini, apparently about to remove her top.</p> <p>On Friday morning, the magazine emerged on the streets of Paris with the pictures of Kate.</p> <p>Sources said that royal officials did not make contact with Closer in Paris last night, because the magazine had already come off the printing presses.</p> <p>But St James's Palace was consulting French lawyers, with royal officials saying the publication was \"turning the clock back 15 years\" to when Princess Diana was pursued by paparazzi.</p> <p>It was reported that the photos were offered to British papers last week, but they all turned them down.</p> <p>However, one picture desk executive on a national tabloid said the set of photos being touted around last week were different. \"They were also long lens, but you couldn't see anything. These pictures nobody has seen, as far I am aware,\" the executive said.</p> <p>The publication of the topless pictures of Kate will not just reignite memories of Princess Diana but will also feed into the Leveson report on the ethics of the press.</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson is currently drafting his final report and recommendations and this controversy will underline the difficulties any future British regulator will have in controlling overseas press and internet publication.</p> <p>Closer's audacious decision to go to press comes just weeks after the US showbusiness website TMZ published photos of a naked Prince Harry cavorting in a Las Vegas hotel room.</p> <p>William and Kate were told about the allegations on Friday morning before they visited the Assyakirin Mosque and had also looked at the images on the Closer website.</p> <p>Speaking about the royal couple, a source said: \"They're saddened their privacy has been breached \u2013 if it has been breached.</p> <p>\"We will talk to our lawyers in London and counterparts in Paris to see what options are available. We're not aware of anyone [in the UK] seeking to publish so the Press Complaints Commission is not coming into it.\"</p> <p>The Sun was the only British newspaper to defy the palace's request not to publish photos of Harry in the nude with an unnamed woman.</p> <p>Prince Charles had issued the request to newspapers, via the PCC, along with a letter from his personal lawyers at Harbottle &amp; Lewis warning them that he had an expectation of privacy under English law, saying there was no possible justification for printing the photos apart from prurience.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>When Sardia was just over a year old, her mother Hasina started to notice she was having difficulties walking and picking things up with her hands.</p> <p>\"I saw that she wasn't like the other children,\" says Hasina, a mother of three from a small village in the north of Bangladesh.</p> <p>\"I watched her and I knew something was wrong, she was walking in a different way to her twin sister and she couldn't really move her limbs.\"</p> <p>Sardia was taken to the local clinic, which referred her to a bigger district hospital. The doctor there told Hasina that he thought her baby had cerebral palsy, but there was nothing that could be done.</p> <p>\"I had no idea what he was talking about, I had never heard of cerebral palsy,\" says Sardia. \"I thought she was going to die.\"</p> <p>Conservative estimates show that in a country with a population of more than 161 million, 1-2% of all babies are born with some form of cerebral palsy.</p> <p>Cerebal palsy is a condition that disrupts the nerve signals between the brain and muscles, often leading to problems with movement, posture and co-ordination as children grow up.</p> <p>Research has linked the condition to prolonged, difficult or premature births, where the baby is somehow deprived of oxygen either in the womb or during delivery.</p> <p>The vast majority of babies with cerebral palsy in Bangladesh are born in rural areas. According to Unicef data, 78% of births in the country still take place in the home, where women experiencing complicated or difficult childbirth lack access to trained medical professionals or treatment services.</p> <p>Hasina was lucky enough to find a doctor who diagnosed Sardia early. Two months on, mother and daughter are starting a two-week therapy course at <a href=\"http://www.crp-bangladesh.org/\" title=\"\">CRP-Bangladesh</a> (Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed). The centre is the only facility in Bangladesh offering any kind of specialised services for children with cerebral palsy and admits 80 children and their mothers every month.</p> <p>Cerebral palsy cannot be cured or even treated, but it can be managed. The centre offers a mix of group sessions, physiotherapy, play and music therapy and education classes for parents; it admits children from three months to 12 years old.</p> <p>\"The earlier the children get here, the more we can do for them, the problem is that mothers are so in the dark about cerebral palsy that children often aren't diagnosed until they are six or seven,\" says Hosneara Perveen, who heads the centre's paediatric unit.</p> <p>Mothers of disabled children still face huge stigma, says Perveen. Many are blamed if their child starts showing signs of disability, such as loss of control of their hands and legs or sudden spasms. This often stop them from seeking help, because they feel ashamed.</p> <p>\"It's the social stigma that has to be tackled,\" says Perveen. \"The only way to do this is to educate the mothers and parents. When they come to the centre, we sit down with the mothers and explain very clearly what cerebral palsy is, how and why it happens, and what can be done to manage it. With therapy, children can show a marked improvement. There is no reason for them to be excluded or shut out.\"</p> <p>For Hasina, understanding cerebral palsy has been transformational. She has been learning forms of play and language therapy to help Sardia and will leave the centre with a physiotherapy programme to try to improve her daughter's co-ordination and balance.</p> <p>The challenge now is to find a way to provide the same kind of education and physical therapy services to the millions of other children with cerebral palsy across the country.</p> <p>Outreach services are next on the centre's list. Perveen has already dispatched some of her staff into the field with former patients, after mothers told her their children were being excluded from school.</p> <p>\"We know teachers are refusing to let children with cerebral palsy into the classroom, but the Bangladeshi government has made a declaration that every child can access education, so we're trying to show mothers they must raise their voices if their child is being denied or tell us [so] we can help them. So far, our workers have got seven children back in the classroom.\"</p> <p>The centre has also launched its own model \"inclusive\" school, where children with cerebral palsy and other disabilities study alongside children with no disabilities.</p> <p>\"Yes, it is a drop in the ocean, but it's a start,\" says Mohamed Quadin, a research associate who has been helping to design programmes at the centre. \"We're trying to expand as fast as we can and the idea is that if we can prove these services work, then we can try to present it to the government as a model that can and must be replicated.\"</p>",
  "<p>Many households in the UK are starting to feel the economic squeeze as job losses, pay freezes, soaring train fares, energy price wars, housing slumps and rising food prices take their toll in austerity Britain.</p> <p>But what about the poorest of households, facing a poverty premium for the same basic essentials we all need?</p> <p>Figures released this month by the Insolvency Service show there has been a 9.6% surge in debt relief orders compared to the same quarter last year. An estimated 310,000 people borrow \u00a3120m each year from loan sharks on which they repay \u00a3450m and it has been suggested that the associated stress, health issues and family breakdown linked to this debt crisis is costing the state \u00a343m annually.</p> <p>With welfare reform expected to increase the pressure on low income families and individuals, Big Lottery Fund's intervention to help prevent more people from spiralling into debt couldn't have come at a better time.</p> <p>Hannah Fearn, the Guardian housing network editor, recently called for housing providers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/editors-blog/2012/jul/27/welfare-reform-vulnerable-families-debt\" title=\"\">to do more to help residents to manage their finances through education</a>, as well as enabling access to cheaper products and services in order to prevent welfare reform measures from overwhelming poorer households.</p> <p>The Big Lottery Fund's improving financial confidence initiative aims to do just this, targeting those identified as the most affected by financial exclusion; social housing tenants moving in and out of work and first time tenants or young people in social housing. We are investing \u00a331.7m in 37 partnership projects across England to enable housing providers and voluntary sector organisations, local authorities and financial service providers, to prevent an estimated 150,000 of the most vulnerable social housing residents from falling into a spiral of debt.</p> <p>City South Manchester Housing is receiving \u00a31m for the mind your money project \u2013 a new partnership of 30 organisations. Using a flagging up system that will alert agencies when a tenant has moved in or out of work, the partnership will ensure that appropriate financial information can be given at the right time. A pre-paid card scheme will be piloted to ensure tenants keep aside money for essential bills.</p> <p>Livin Housing is working with 15 partners to reach 20,000 young and first time social housing tenants across County Durham. The \u00a3800,000 project will provide information and practical advice on products and services \u2013 including how to get hold of affordable furniture, reduce fuel bills, set up a bank account and access affordable credit. This should reduce the number of evictions and terminations in the first year of tenancy by helping people to budget and remain in control of their finances.</p> <p>There is a long way to go: total household debt stands at \u00a31.5tn. But by investing in financial support during the early stages of someone's tenancy we can all help towards preventing individuals falling into debt, which ultimately becomes more costly for tenants and landlords later on.</p> <p>The Big Lottery Fund will be working with all the projects to gather evidence of best practice and which methods have been most successful to share with policymakers and service providers.

  "<p>It's one of the most infuriating sentences uttered at a restaurant table. You forgo starters with heavy heart (and empty stomach), turn down the marbled temptations of grass-fed fillet for the terrine-\u00e0-la-cheap-cuts, go halves on dessert with an equally frugal friend, only to have some cheery-faced lout down the other end of the table holler, \"So shall we just split the bill then?\"</p> <p>Ever since the opening of the first restaurant, when the first bill hit the first table, diners have looked at each other and intoned the bill-splitters' mantra: \"So how shall we do this?\"<br><br>In China, tradition dictates an increasing vigorous tussle over the bill until, like the alpha-male in an Attenborough documentary, the most senior of the herd wins the day and settles the debt alone. In contrast, it's not unusual in Germany for each diner to be presented with their own itemised bill.</p> <p>In the UK, however, we flit between paying individually, splitting evenly or some mathematically complicated mixture of the two \u2013 leading to frustration, distress and, in some cases, some highly mercenary tactical dish-selection.</p> <p>Firstly, there's the plight of the small eater. It is perhaps a sign of modern fashions that eating lightly (especially if you're nurturing a healthy BMI) is now severely frowned upon in polite company. The words \"don't tell me you're on a diet!\" are usually enough to shame the modest eater into ordering an unwanted chocolate fondant with cream. Social niceties then dictates that no fuss be made over one's own portion of the theoretical bill; instead, hope rests on the chance that some conscientious white knight will quietly point out that Amanda only had the soup and half a chocolate fondant, and insist that the remaining bill is split. Split, that is, equally among everyone else present.</p> <p>The question of alcohol consumption is another flammable after-dinner topic. Better the teetotaller be, than the one who nurses a solitary glass of wine the whole evening only to be lumped in with \"the drinkers\" when the night's damage is tallied up across a bottle-strewn table.</p> <p>It's a topic that draws academic attention. The Economic Journal published a paper entitled <a href=\"http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/splitting-bill.pdf\">The Inefficiency of Splitting the Bill (pdf)</a>, in which the authors consider what they term the \"unscrupulous diner's dilemma\": \"When a group of diners jointly enjoys a meal at a restaurant, often an unspoken agreement exists to divide the check equally. A selfish diner could thereby enjoy exceptional dinners at bargain prices.\"</p> <p>They set up three scenarios for a group of six diners: paying individually, splitting the bill equally, and receiving a free meal. Unsurprisingly, the average bill is smallest in the first case, with diners ordering 1.67 dishes on average. Move to splitting the bill equally, and average meal cost jumps by 36%. However, that's nothing compared to the free meal scenario, where participants ordered 3 dishes on average and the meal cost skyrocketed to 220% the cost of paying individually. Something to perhaps consider, before offering to pay for dinner on your next birthday.</p> <p>Over the pond, the Americans have developed their own solution to the gentle art of bill splitting: the recently released <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foodivide/id541355429?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Foodivide iPhone app</a>, which apparently provides the \"fastest and most drop dead gorgeous way to split a bill\". The app-wielder taps in every food item and drags-and-drops it (gorgeously, we assume) onto each diner's virtual plate, thus calculating everyone's exact share of the bill, tax and service included. Given that you'd need eagle eyes and an eidetic memory to remember who ordered what without doing the grand \"So what did you order?\" table survey, you wonder where the time and social gain really lies, apart from dealing with the numerically- or generosity-challenged who think that adding 12.5% to a bill means rounding up to the nearest pound.</p> <p>And let's not get started on the complex modern ritual of who pays the bill when a new couple go out for dinner, where even reaching for the plastic could jeopardise (or rapidly boost) one's chances of romantic success. That said, they say that being able to discuss finances in a frank and non-confrontational manner is one of the keys to long term relationship success. So go ahead a pin your date down on exactly what is implied by \"let me get this one\". It could save years of stress and heartache in the long run.</p> <p>So how do you usually split the bill? Is it ever polite to ask to pay individually? Or should we all just keep quiet and order the lobster?</p>",

  "<p>The events of 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough were a tragedy. South Yorkshire police, the force I joined in 2006, failed victims and families on that dreadful day, and failed them again in the aftermath of what remains the UK's biggest sporting disaster.</p> <p>Like many of my fellow officers, I feel profound sorrow at what happened at Hillsborough. It is difficult to imagine the pain undergone by the families involved. I hope that <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Wednesday's report</a> can go some way towards healing the trauma caused.</p> <p>The difficult lessons of the authorities' failure at Hillsborough continue, but the inadequacy of the policing operation has already led in part to a profound transformation in the way football matches are policed today. At the core of that transformation is a determination to work in partnership with football fans and clubs, to get away from a mindset of \"fans as troublemakers\" which unfortunately still persists today in the way British football fans are sometimes perceived abroad.</p> <p>Given the reduction in violence and disorder associated with football, we are now able to put crowd safety and control at football grounds at the centre of policing plans for matches.</p> <p>In the planning for a major event we look at the major disaster plan, understand and test it. Post-event we debrief and learn from any near misses or incidents. Vitally, this includes discussion of triage, the response of emergency services and evacuation plans.</p> <p>Match commanders are trained to an incredibly high standard, and no one is allowed to command an event without appropriate extensive training. The training covers tactics in public order and safety, in keeping the piece and in human rights.</p> <p>Operational orders are now prepared ahead of every football match where there will be a policing presence. These plans specifically require forces to identify sufficient reserves to allow for rapid deployment of officers to any part of the ground in an emergency.</p> <p>The more focused approach to policing football, together with an emphasis on crowd safety, allows matches to take place using far fewer officers. At a recent high-profile game at Sheffield Wednesday FC, a high-risk fixture, there were 150 officers on duty \u2013 about 100 of whom were at the ground. This compares with Hillsborough where there were 1,200 officers on duty, of whom 800 were at the ground.</p> <p>Today we have better stewarding and better technology which gives us a sophisticated understanding of crowd flows. We can electronically lock gates, and electronic ticketing in all-seated stadiums means we know where all fans are. Football intelligence officers work with clubs across the country with match safety at the forefront of their work.</p> <p>The police service has successfully enforced legislation on football banning orders to prevent those intent on causing violence from attending matches, and on the consumption of alcohol within grounds \u2013 all with the wider interests of safety in mind.</p> <p>Across the piece, we've moved from amateur to professional in our approach.</p> <p>The UK football policing unit has become a centre of expertise on policing football both at home and abroad. Our officers are routinely sought out to advise other countries on football policing, specifically on safety and security and to deliver training.</p> <p>However, even with these changes, the safety and security of people within and outside stadiums must remain a key priority for the police service. The Hillsborough tragedy serves as a reminder to all agencies of the need to continually review approaches to the management of sporting events. Since those dark days we've worked very hard to build trust and co-operation with all in the football community. We have to continue working together to ensure we carry on improving safety and security at football matches in future.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Carl Gardner, barrister who spent 12 years in Whitehall working for a number of departments including the DWP and HMRC and acted as adviser to the Cabinet Office and the Attorney General's Office</strong></h2> <p><strong>I felt I wasn't the 'right sort of person'. </strong>I left at the end of 2007 because there seemed to be no way up for me. I'd got lots of experience, taken a lot of responsibility and ticked all the boxes I was supposed to tick to aspire to the senior civil service. But I just couldn't get the key line managers on whom my future career depended completely to give me enough backing \u2013 or to explain why not. While I loved most of my experience in government, I was left with the feeling that many senior civil servants are very bad at managing people, and that this does affect its ability to retain talent.</p> <p><strong>There was a glass ceiling for me in the civil service. </strong>I'm not sure it was about class, and I don't think it was about education. If I'm right, I think it's a complex mix of other things. I have quite a strong regional accent, and sometimes I think that affects how people see me. More importantly, I think that period of part-time working affected some senior peoples' view of me. Perhaps my own period of working part-time made my subsequent experience resemble a woman's in some ways.</p> <p><strong>There's a big trend for top appointments to be made from the private sector. </strong>In the middle of the civil service you can get the feeling that you're meant to just stay put as a kind of public sector underclass, while outside people are being appointed above you. What's frustrating and confusing is that I also hope some of these outside appointments could be part of the solution. If outsiders at the top can see the problems of career and people management below them, and remedy them \u2013 good. There is also a problem that insiders promoted to the top can be the very people for whom the status quo has worked very well. These are perhaps those most resistant to change.</p> <h2><strong>Sharon O'Dea, online communications specialist at Standard Chartered Bank. She previously worked for a number of public sector organisations in central and local government</strong></h2> <p><strong>Outsourcing impacts on the morale and opportunities of staff: </strong>In several organisation I've worked in there was a sense of resentment that the 'sexy stuff' is given to consultants and agencies. I'm not sure that was always the case \u2013 often agencies really are better placed to provide the required skills to a tight timeframe. But it's true there are often cases where work of the same quality could be delivered more cheaply using in-house resources if some thought was given to it.</p> <p><strong>Fast-streamers get the bulk of opportunities: </strong>I really enjoyed working in the public sector; the work is interesting and it does usually feel like you're making a difference. But the glacial rate of progression and progress is stifling for many. This is something I hear a lot from friends in the civil service; fast streamers moved from project to project, while those who joined at other points languishing on the same grade for years. The low turnover rate, especially now, with the recession making people disinclined to move, and with the overall number of posts shrinking, means there are even fewer opportunities for the ambitious.</p> <p><strong>Absurd social media rules make public servants feel trapped. </strong>In one widely-publicised case a couple of years ago, a mid-ranking civil servant was castigated by the Daily Mail for some mildly critical remarks and for being 'friends' with Sally Bercow on Twitter. She worked in the IT side of finance, didn't have any kind of advisory role, and wasn't politically restricted. Does a [retweet] on Twitter compromise neutrality? We run the risk of making such rules so absurd they effectively ban public servants from using social media at all.</p> <h2><strong>Kevin Lloyd, a former senior civil servant who wrote about why he left the civil service </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/11/civil-service-whitehall-voluntary-redundancy\" title=\"\"><strong>here.</strong></a><strong> He is founder of the consultancy </strong><a href=\"http://mountgroveassociates.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Mountgrove Associates</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>It is doubtful if there is still a distinctive role for a civil servant.</strong> As more roles that could be said to have almost embodied the impartiality, integrity and objectivity that has always been at the heart of a neutral civil service (thinking here particularly about policy advice to ministers) might be seen as ones that can be played by other people and if there is more emphasis on inviting and seeking multiple viewpoints in a less mediated way, then just what is the special purpose of being a civil servant?</p> <p><strong>The departure of permanent secretaries has an effect on the remaining workforce. </strong>The loss of people from the most senior positions who have grown up in the civil service and have been seen as stars for some considerable time is a matter of genuine concern. Taken together with the increasing rhetoric and emphasis on introducing a larger number of people from outside at very senior levels it is quite hard to argue that this doesn't have an impact on the perception of people working in departments about their own futures.</p> <p><strong>To say I experienced 'class bias' is a slight overstatement. </strong>To put it slightly pejoratively, posh people frequently don't have much of a problem with confidence and have an expectation of a certain status. The less posh among us probably don't draw on quite the same reserves or sense of entitlement.</p> <p>Confidence in these circumstances may derive from doing a job well and being able to demonstrate your skills and abilities and feeling encouraged to do so. When some of those footings seem less secure and there seems to be more emphasis on style and presentation then you can start to become more bothered by such things. Clearly different for different people but that was one aspect of how it felt for me.</p> <h2><strong>Professor Colin Talbot, professor of government and public administration, Manchester Business School</strong></h2> <p><strong>The whole fast stream idea needs reviewing. </strong>It might have made sense when there were few graduates in the civil service, but today there are many more. In my experience a lot fast streamers rise without trace; its hard to point to what they've achieved because they never stay anywhere long enough to see things through.</p> <p><strong>Class is an issue in the senior civil service</strong>. I have always been struck, as someone from a working-class background, at just how class-dominated the senior civil service is. I've lost count at the number of times I've had Latin thrown at me. I guess I have strong antennae for it, but there is a very particular culture which I don't find at the top of civil services in other countries, and I've been in quite a few.</p> <p><strong>A 'those who can, teach' style campaign to boost morale won't work. </strong>Everyone understands that education is good for you. But few understand that government is good for you. The real debate is about how much government we should have \u2013 a bit more or a bit less, or a bit different \u2013 but much of the political rhetoric is couched in \"government is bad for you\" terms.</p> <h2><strong>Wendy Bradley, a former civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs</strong></h2> <p><strong>Public service needs to be taken more seriously. </strong>It isn't a rest home for people too lazy or incompetent for a 'proper' job in the private sector as some ministers and journalists seem to believe. There is a compact between the country and its civil servants similar to the military compact. Public servants will accept lower pay than market rates in return for the opportunity to serve, recognition for their achievements, and the support of their government and communities.</p> <p><strong>Immediate line managers should be taken out of the promotion process. </strong>In my early career with the Inland Revenue I experienced the change from a centrally managed career service, where you could go to talk to someone without an axe to grind about how your talents and abilities fitted in with the needs of the service, to a system where you had to \"take responsibility\" for your own career. The unintended consequences which flowed from this continued to blight things like movement between different areas of the same department for years.</p> <p><strong>There isn't a dearth of female talent. </strong>Some of my best friends, to coin a phrase, are talented, remarkable women who also happen to work in the civil service. But yes, there's a problem with the pipeline that takes women (or doesn't take them) to the top jobs. There are fewer promotion and progression opportunities in a shrinking service anyway, and in a pay freeze where pay, pensions and conditions are under attack there isn't an option of standing still.</p> <p>White men are having the same problems; but when the advancement of women, ethnic minorities and disabled people is so fragile it can feel as if the equalities ladder is being kicked out from under us.</p> <p><strong>Join the </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/public-leaders/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Public Leaders Network</strong></a><strong> free to receive regular emails on the issues at the top of the professional agenda.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Disney has admitted it will be <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-50-million-writedown-jay-rasulo-370146\" title=\"\">forced to write off more than $50m</a> after cancelling a film project \u2013 believed to be Coraline director Henry Selick's latest stop-motion venture \u2013 earlier this year.</p> <p>It was revealed in August that the untitled project from the highly respected film-maker, which had 150 San Francisco based animators working on it, had been cancelled. Despite having been shooting since the previous summer, <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/disney-halts-henry-selicks-stop-motion-animated-film/\" title=\"\">industry blog Deadline reported</a> that the film \"just wasn't coming together in a manner that pleased the studio\". Little information has been forthcoming as to the exact nature of Selick's film, but a <a href=\"http://www.creativeheads.net/job/9592/storyboard-leadsupervisor-in-san-francisco\" title=\"\">job posting on creativeheads.net</a> last year listed the Selick project under the title Shade Maker and described Selick's mandate to \"make great, scary films for young 'uns\".</p> <p>Selick, who also directed critically acclaimed animation features such as The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach, rejoined Disney in 2010 (where he also worked as a young apprentice animator post-college) in what was described at the time as a long-term contract to produce stop-motion animation films. It was previously reported that he would be <a href=\"http://www.frontrowreviews.co.uk/reviews/henry-selick-to-join-disneypixar/4686\" title=\"\">permitted to approach other studios</a> with the cancelled film.</p> <p>The suggestion that Disney torpedoed a project from a highly respected animator with a strong track record at huge expense hints at an unprecedented jitteriness at the company. Earlier this year, the company was forced to admit that it might lose $200m due to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/20/john-carter-lose-disney-200m\" title=\"\">disappointing performance of science-fiction epic John Carter</a>, which many in the industry blamed on poor marketing. Nevertheless, the studio is hardly faring badly on the whole in 2012 thanks to the enormous box office success of comic-book movie The Avengers. Joss Whedon's superhero ensemble has taken more than $1.5bn, making it Disney's highest grossing film of all time and the third highest overall.</p> <p>The studio has also seen animated film Brave, produced by its wholly owned division Pixar, perform well at the box office this year. The boisterous Scottish-set fairytale fantasy has taken $488m worldwide.</p> <p>The $50m write-down was announced by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo at a communications and entertainment conference in Los Angeles yesterday. Rasulo did not name the project in question but said it would cost the company two cents in per-share earnings. Selick's film had been expected to hit cinemas in October 2013.</p> <p>The veteran animator was reported earlier this year to be in line to direct an adaptation of Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book at Disney, though it is not known if that project is still in the works. Gaiman also wrote the 2002 novella upon which Selick's Coraline was based.</p>",
  "<p>Every day I get about 120 emails, four texts, and six messages on Facebook. Sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed by all the technology that sits in between me and the people I'm trying to reach.</p> <p>I imagine Professor Scott Fahlman struggling with the same feeling almost exactly 30 years ago when he suggested that the computer science department of Carnegie Mellon University adopt emoticons on its online bulletin board. On 19 September 1982 at 11.44am he changed the way we write, starting with: \"I propose that [sic] the following character sequence for joke markers: :-)\"</p> <p>Long before online bulletin boards, people used to pass on their histories by word of mouth. And how they communicated went beyond just the words they spoke. Body language, eye contact, tone of voice and even smell added signals that gave their words a much wider and more nuanced spectrum of meaning.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the stuff we type today looks the same regardless of who we are or what mood we're in. Helvetica, one of the most popular fonts in the world, was designed to be neutral so it could suit all kinds of contexts. So apart from the occasional transgression into the dubious world of Comic Sans, our business memos look just like our love letters, which look just like our complaints to the editor.</p> <p>To balance out all this sameness, people often resort to exclamation marks, ALL CAPS, smiley faces, and sometimes even Hello Kitty emoticons, which can have the effect of a squealing teenager. However tempting it may be to litter your text with winks and LOLS (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/may/11/rebekah-brooks-david-cameron-texts-lol\" title=\"\">are you listening, prime minister</a>?), it's important to practise restraint.</p> <p>Imagine William Carlos Williams' poem The Red Wheelbarrow if it was written by some of the standards we use today:</p> <p>SO much depends</p> <p>upon</p> <p>a red wheel</p> <p>barrow :)</p> <p>glazed with rain!</p> <p>water!</p> <p>beside the white</p> <p>chickens ?!</p> <p>As Mark Twain said: \"If I'd had more time, I'd have written a shorter letter.\" The same sentiment can be applied to content that doesn't use theatrical punctuation to make the emotions of the writer clear. It's hard to write simply and do it with feeling, especially when we're constantly emailing, texting, and messaging.</p> <p>The problem with using punctuation and wingdings to communicate emotion is that it's usually too much. Whether reading an email or trying to navigate through a set of written instructions, unnecessary noise can be confusing and frustrating. Like looking at Piccadilly Circus or Times Square, it's overwhelming and says too much and nothing all at once. If everything is exciting and important, nothing is.</p> <p>Here are some of the things I do to resist the urge to over-amplify my own writing:</p> <p><strong>Read it out loud</strong></p> <p>Ad man David Ogilvy and countless others have advocated this as a way to hear how writing will feel to the people reading it. Read strong, non-standard punctuation in the tone it's meant to literally convey. For example, when you read sentences ending in an exclamation mark, read them exuberantly. If it sounds silly or phoney, consider replacing the exclamation with a full stop.</p> <p><strong>Think about your reader</strong></p> <p>There's a difference between writing a letter to a friend and writing instructional or business content. Your friends and family know you and will probably hear your voice when they read your words. Strangers who read what you've written (hi there, strangers) will be less forgiving. Think about your reader and write accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Go shorter</strong></p> <p>According to a web usability study by Jakob Nielsen, people only read an average of 28% of the text on a standard web page. Be ruthless and cut deep.</p> <p><strong>Identify your own jargon</strong></p> <p>If your goal is to communicate, coded language that's hard to understand is not your friend. Figure out what you're trying to say and make it your mission to do it in the clearest, simplest way possible.</p> <p><strong>Make peace with neutrality</strong></p> <p>The quiet parts in your writing are the canvas for the joyous, bright moments. Even without smiley faces and exclamations in every sentence, people will still think you're OK.</p> <p>Expressive and effective language is possible, even when there's a network of invisible wires and servers between you and your reader.</p> <p>And just so you all know, I'm smiling as I type this.</p> <p><em>Amy Thibodeau is a content strategist at Facebook.

These kids were very relaxed and bright. I think they look quite grown up, and they\u2019re definitely cool without being stroppy. You\u2019ve got the boy in the cool scarf, the girl in the fashionable Vans; and you can see that the school has commissioned a graffiti artist to decorate the classroom. Youth culture is a part of the fabric of the building.

It was a one-room primary school in a tiny village in a mountainous, largely agricultural region of Yemen. The views out of the windows were spectacular. We had to use 100m of cables to work my lights because there was no electricity. I\u00a0guess that the kids were between five and 12, although some might even have been younger. Small rural schools such as this were more relaxed about boys and girls being taught together.

The district was extraordinary \u2013 like pictures I had seen of Detroit. You could drive through block after block of houses that were almost falling down. The school was a large, fairly old and traditional building, but the headmaster was very enthusiastic and I got a sense that the kids and teachers got on well. This was a proper lesson. It was geometry and it was way over my head. I visited a\u00a0few state schools in this district of St Louis, and the only one that had more than a handful of any white students at all was the Gifted and Talented school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Germain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395983368\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347365061039/School-Bornago-College-Ne-014.jpg\" alt=\"World Classrooms: School Bornago College, Netherlands\" width=\"611\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>School</strong> Bornago College, Netherlands<br/> <strong>Fertility rate</strong> 1.8<br/> <strong>Life expectancy at birth</strong> 81<br/> <strong>Population on less than $2 a day</strong> 0%<br/> <strong>Primary age children not in school</strong> 1%<br/> <strong>Youth literacy</strong> 99.7%<br/><br/> These kids were having a sports day.

They asked me lots of questions about what I thought of their country, whether I thought it was nice, whether I thought it was poor. They were very ambitious, believed that school was an important opportunity, and they wanted to do something with their lives and planned to study on.

  "<p>Government proposals to slash the \u00a372,000 compensation cap for unfair dismissal will only serve to make it easier for bosses to mistreat staff, and are another \"slap in the face for workers\", according to the TUC.</p> <p>Unions reacted with anger after the decision to lower the cap was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/14/unfair-dismissal-compensation-cap-cut1\" title=\"\">announced by the business secretary, Vince Cable</a>, as part of a package of measures that he said were designed to make it easier for employers to hire staff while protecting \"basic labour rights\".</p> <p>The construction union UCATT said the new cap, which may be set at the employee's annual salary, or another lower figure, was an \"act of vengeance against workers\" by the coalition government, while the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said the government should concentrate on a credible plan for growth rather than \"sacrificing people's rights at work\".</p> <p>Cable believes the current maximum \u2013 though awarded in only 1% or 2% of cases a year \u2013 deters employers from hiring staff. The current median award is only \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000, with 6% of cases leading to awards over \u00a330,000.</p> <p>He has resisted pressure to adopt compulsory no-fault dismissal \u2013 a proposal advanced by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/23/beecroft-proposals-coalition-support-criticism\" title=\"Guardiasn: Beecroft proposals: how Tory donor's radical blueprint split the government\">Adrian Beecroft </a>in a report commissioned by David Cameron and given near-totemic status by the Tory right.</p> <p>The business secretary will instead back a voluntary scheme in which employers and staff can sign settlement agreements that would allow an employee to leave a company with a good reference providing they waived their right to pursue unfair dismissal proceedings at a tribunal. The agreements will come into force next summer.</p> <p>Cable told ITV Daybreak the government had taken a \"moderate\" approach to labour reforms. \"We've been very, very careful and moderate in the way we have approached this and taken it step by step and consulted at every stage.</p> <p>\"We are trying to have it both ways because we do want the best of both worlds, we want to have confidence in business that they can hire people, but we want people to go to work knowing that at the end of the day, if they have a very bad relationship, they do have some basic labour rights and protection.\"</p> <p>Barber welcomed the fact that the central plank of the Beecroft report's proposals had been ignored, but warned that reducing payouts for unfair dismissals will \"let bad employers off lightly\" and deter victims from pursuing genuine cases.</p> <p>\"This will feel like another slap in the face following the government's decision to bring in fees for employment tribunals,\" said Barber. \"For all the government's talk that helping businesses to sack poor performing workers will make companies more productive, this is little more than a smokescreen to erode hard won rights.</p> <p>\"Making it easier for bad employers to get away with misconduct is not the way to kickstart our economy and will not create a single new job.\"</p> <p>Umunna said: \"Ministers should be making it easier to hire, not easier to fire people. We are in a double dip recession due to this government's failed economic policies, not because of the protections people have at work. Instead of adopting a credible plan for growth, this government is attacking rights of every employee in this country.</p> <p>Sacrificing people's rights at work is not the way to bolster consumer confidence and get our economy moving again.\"</p> <p>UCATT leader Steve Murphy, said: \"Vince Cable needs a serious reality check. In many industries such as construction, employers frequently ride roughshod over existing employment rights. By weakening the law, employers are being further encouraged to mistreat their workers.\"</p> <p>Paul Kenny, GMB general secretary, said employers' decisions to hire more staff were based on confidence about future demand for their good and services, not the rights of their staff.</p> <p>\"Employers' confidence has been knocked sideways by this government stalling the recovery they inherited and the double dip recession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In fact the steps being taken here by government, and the 'noises off' about it being easier to sack people, will have a much more profound effect on workers than employers. It will increase feelings of job insecurity and reduce the confidence of workers as consumers to commit to spending.</p> <p>\"Therefore it will have a dampening effect on consumer demand which will in turn further weaken the confidence of businesses who consequently will not take on workers. The policy will have precisely the opposite effect on jobs than the stated intention of the government.\"</p> <p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT said: \"The Liberal Democrats should be ashamed to be associated with the introduction of measures which give employers licence to exploit, bully and discriminate against their workforce. However the coalition seeks to spin this announcement, this emphasises the contempt for working people which pervades the coalition's policies.\"</p>",
  "<p>I spent yesterday at a conference in Cambridge on the theme of \"<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">reputation in the age of protest</a>\", sponsored by the YouGov polling organisation and addressed by speakers as diverse as British and US government officials, corporate CEOs and Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian blogger who was nominated for the Nobel peace prize for his role in the Arab spring.</p> <p>In a world where, so several people reminded the audience, reputations acquired over 20 years can be lost on Twitter in a careless five minutes, the session was a mixture of optimism and occasional alarm bells. How could it be otherwise on a day when the Hillsborough coverup was finally exposed (a Leveson scandal before Leveson!) and when a tawdry and provocative Islam-bashing US film had provoked an ugly and deadly response, equally foolish, in the Middle East?</p> <p>On a lighter depressing note, we woke this morning \u2013 the conference, co-sponsored by the Guardian, continues today \u2013 to find that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/14/kate-william-furious-topless-photographs\" title=\"\">snatch-photos of a topless Duchess of Cambridge are being published in a French magazine</a>. Odd in a country whose ferocious privacy laws protected the likes of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but serving no evident public interest. Alas, as with Prince Harry's willie, we will hear more spurious claims about the public right to leer from slow learners in Fleet Street.</p> <p>In Cambridge yesterday all sorts of people said that governments and corporations can't control the new social media (or can they? warned others) and had better get with the programme, responding as rapidly to individual consumer complaints aired online as BP did to the Deepwater oil rig disaster, only more adroitly.</p> <p>Likewise diplomats, who need to adapt to ever-faster news cycles in different time zones \u2013 which also means embracing Twitter and Facebook. But the likes of Ghonim also wondered if the flipside of a binary online world (good/bad with few nuances), where brutal online ridicule and loathing is widespread, might have quashed the noble aspirations of an Abraham Lincoln or a Martin Luther King at an early stage.</p> <p>Fascinating stuff, but all tough stuff too, underpinned by the way globalisation is reinforced by internet technology at a time when the west's leadership in that globalising wave is being challenged by a resurgent Asia. But \"Globalisation 2.0\" also sees what Joel Rogers, director of YouGov Cambridge, calls \"transnational forces of public opinion\", which make it all much harder to manage in traditional ways.</p> <p>In other words, individuals are more empowered by the internet, and a new global middle class can make its influence felt against tyrannical or merely incompetent government \u2013 most visibly across the Middle East since 2011 \u2013 as can society's discontented, those who have lost their jobs and prosperity thanks to globalisation's shifts of production or who can see on TV and their smartphones what others have and want it too. In the wake of global financial meltdown extremes of right and left return to challenge the politics of centrism.</p> <p>Parts of yesterday's exchanges were of a familiar kind, almost pre-internet. Thus General Lord (Richard) Dannatt, former chief of the general staff, spoke of Britain's lingering postcolonial obligations in many parts of the world, but also how the risks of military intervention had often been understated since the Falklands war of 1982 revived the fashion. Politicians, solders and diplomats focus too much on immediate problems instead of horizon-scanning to nip potential problems in the bud.</p> <p>The conference was backed by global polling which the Guardian has been reporting in the past few days: predictable mistrust of Mitt Romney in Europe, for example, and the divergent views on the state and social policy on the two sides of the Atlantic, but also lingering mistrust of Britain for its receding imperial role in the Middle East and north Africa to offset more positive attributes such as democracy and the rule of law. British education is a conspicuously successful feature of its \"soft power\" in 2012.</p> <p>Politicians get a predictable kicking in terms of public trust and reputation, though someone \u2013 a corporate, not a politician \u2013 pointed out that fewer than one in three MPs were compromised by the MPs' expenses scandal and that this had not been sufficiently pointed out. Quite so. Less predictably, Gary Hoffman, the Barclays banker who stepped in to sort out tottering Northern Rock in 2008 \u2013 he was going off Barclays at the time \u2013 said he did so because he was impressed by customer loyalty.</p> <p>Even as they took their savings out in panic they said they wanted to put them back again when things settled down. Yes, you can change corporate culture and correct past error, including corrupt practices but \u2013 said someone else \u2013 you have to spend more time on low-probability/high-risk problems than the less important high-probability/low-risk kind that firms tend to focus on.</p> <p>And yes, you need to have established good relations with the government \u2013 or media \u2013 before a crisis breaks. It's too late when it's already under way. That was one of BP's problems in the Gulf of Mexico, compounded by CEO Tony Hayward's decision (his advisers told him to) to go on US TV in person \u2013 a Brit with an unfortunate accent and smirk \u2013 instead of putting up one of BP's tough Texan oilmen.</p> <p>It's all about adaptation to change in ever-faster circumstances. The British army thinks the US army is too \"kinetic\" \u2013 too hyperactive \u2013 and that its own experience in Northern Ireland would allow it to run Basra with ease. But the Americans adapted more quickly and created General David Petraeus's \"counter-insurgency army\" to defeat al-Qaida and force the Saddamist Sunni insurgents to negotiate with the Shia majority, said Sir Robert Fry, a clever former marine general. In Syria it is the Sunnis who are the repressed majority \u2013 a mirror-image situation which is encouraging renewed militancy in Iraq.</p> <p>I could write much more. Let's end on a negative note and a positive one. Fry said that the invasion of Iraq broke a 200-year British consensus about the utility of force: that the government of the day would only fight when it had to and that the military would eventually do the job honourably and well with public support.</p> <p>I thought that verdict overlooked all sorts of controversy and incompetence, from the Crimean and Boer wars to the Kenyan and Malayan emergencies, but we can see that there will be fewer such interventions in future. Chinese strategic thinkers cannot believe how incompetent the US and its British allies have been in recent deployments, said Fry, unleashing forces they did not understand with awful consequences.</p> <p>The day's closing session was more optimistic. Ghonim, jailed in Cairo during the Egyptian revolution, spoke of the internet as a tool which made it harder for repressive regimes to deny inconvenient facts or sweep protest under the carpet (how can it when the photos are on Facebook?) and insisted that the wisdom of crowds \u2013 \"the masses always outsmart the politicians\" \u2013 can prevail.</p> <p>Would the Egyptian revolution have occurred without the internet? Yes, but differently and more slowly, Ghonim suggested. Are the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist forces a threat to the openness and reform which the Globalisation 2.0 world seeks? The Brotherhood is in power now, not simply criticising from the sidelines. That makes it more realistic and will make its supporters more realistic over time, he seemed to suggest.</p> <p>With all the dismay evident among Muslim speakers at the murder of Chris Stevens, the sympathetic US ambassador to Libya \u2013 the provocative film is so ridiculous that it amounts to a promotion for Islam, Ghonim explained \u2013 it was hard to pretend that the road ahead would be easy. After all, Egypt and Algeria almost came to blows after online abuse between supporters of their two sides before a World Cup qualifier.</p> <p>But Ghonim was warm and wise, a good speaker with whom to end the day.</p>",

  "<p>A standoff between Chinese and Japanese ships in disputed waters claimed by both countries has increased concern about the growing tensions in a long-simmering territorial row in the East China Sea.</p> <p>Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest after surveillance ships entered the area around the island group \u2013 known as the Diaoyu to China and Senkaku to Japan \u2013 which is controlled by Japan. Vessels from the two countries radioed each other with warnings to leave the waters.</p> <p>There were signs of the row spilling over at street level: a Japanese man in Shanghai was reportedly injured when <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2012/09/14/japanese_man_splattered_with_hot_no.php\" title=\"\">hot noodles were thrown into his face</a>\u2013 the sixth such attack in recent days.</p> <p>Brad Glosserman, executive director at Honolulu's Pacific Forum CSIS, told Reuters: \"The dangers of miscalculation are real.\"</p> <p>Taylor Fravel of the security studies programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: \"Neither side wants to see the situation spiral out of control, but both felt that they had to act. We should be concerned, but it has not yet crossed a point of no return.\"</p> <p>The island group is surrounded by rich energy resources and fisheries. The sovereignty dispute reignited when both Chinese and Japanese activists landed there last month and protests broke out in several Chinese cities, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/china-protest-japan-senkaku-diaoyo-island\" title=\"\">attacks on Japanese cars and businesses</a>.</p> <p>It became even more fraught when Tokyo's nationalist governor Shintaro Ishihara said the city would buy and develop the uninhabited islands from their private owners, who are Japanese. The central government then arranged to buy them, despite Beijing's protests.</p> <p>\"From the Japanese side it was the best outcome&#xa0;\u2026 Ishihara is extremely rightwing and ultra-nationalist and if he controlled these islands there is no telling what he might do with them. It seems almost like he wants to provoke China on this. The Japanese government clearly does not,\" said Ian Storey, an expert on maritime issues at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.</p> <p>Although Chinese vessels have entered the area before, their voyages have not been announced. This time the foreign ministry in Beijing said the ships were there to conduct maritime surveillance and that China was carrying out a mission of \"law enforcement over its maritime rights\".</p> <p>Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told reporters: \"We lodged a strong protest and also we made a strong case that the Chinese side should leave from the territorial waters around the Senkaku islands.</p> <p>\"I'd like to underscore that we should never let the situation escalate and we have strong hopes for the Chinese to respond in an appropriate and calm manner.\"</p> <p>Kyodo news agency reported that the Chinese ships withdrew from the disputed waters on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>China is Japan's biggest trading partner. But deep-rooted popular mistrust endures, fuelled by memories of the brutality of the Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s. Complicating matters further is the impending leadership change in China and a looming election in Japan.</p> <p>Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, warned that the possibility of military conflict could not be eliminated. \"Chinese leaders actually talk tough and act carefully, but sometimes it's out of your control. Chinese public opinion has become so powerful. They have to talk very, very tough. By doing so, they will help enhance the tensions,\" he told AP.</p> <p>With popular feeling running high, Beijing saw small scale anti-Japanese protests on Thursday and Friday. One shopping centre in the capital was showing images of anti-Japanese demonstrators and the Diaoyu islands on its giant screen, rather than the usual entertainment videos.</p> <p>The phrase \"the Diaoyu Islands are China's\" appeared almost 2.5m times over 24 hours on the popular Sina Weibo microblog, although it was outnumbered three-fold by references to the iPhone 5.</p> <p>Earlier this week, one man even <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2012/09/14/man_unfurls_anti-japanese_banners_s.php\" title=\"\">set fire to his own Honda</a> vehicle in protest against Japan.</p> <p>Some Chinese travel agents have reportedly cancelled tours to Japan and Japanese businessmen told Reuters that officials have asked firms to cancel or postpone public events and major sales promotions. This week, the Shanghai government dropped the name of Japanese sponsor Toray Industries from the title of the city's December marathon.</p>",

  "<p>Pounding the towpath on my lunchtime runs, in my head I was still clocking six-minute miles like those I ran in 10k races over a decade ago. But my first experience with a run-tracking app \u2013 using a phone's GPS to detail my exact pace for every mile run \u2013 revealed I was less a wannabe Mo Farah, and more a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/series/ed-balls-s-marathon-diary\">sprightly version of Ed Balls</a>.</p> <p>This year, after discovering my colleague <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/series/running-with-the-kenyans\">Adharanand Finn</a> ran the New York marathon in two hours 55 minutes and learning that several other Guardian runners were planning to crack the significant milestone of sub three-hour marathons, I set myself the masochistic task of <a href=\"http://justgiving.com/vaughanmarathon\" title=\"\">trying to run next year's London marathon for charity in under three hours</a>. The fastest I've done one before is 26 minutes slower. In a bid to close the gap, I've turned to technology.</p> <p>Can an app make you run faster? Yes, for me at least. Beat-yourself challenges and virtual leaderboards keep you on your toes and away from complacency if you run alone most of the time. And the dashboard and tracking tools of iOS and Android apps, as well as GPS watches, mean you can't lie to yourself about whether you're racking up, say, the 40+ miles a week you should be for a sub three-hour marathon.</p> <p>But there are big differences in how the services line up, as outlined below. I'd love to hear your experiences. I left out <a href=\"http://runstar.se/\" title=\"\">Runstar</a> and have heard good things about <a href=\"https://www.zombiesrungame.com/\" title=\"\">Zombies, run!</a>, so let me know in the comments how you've fared with either of those.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.endomondo.com/login\" title=\"\">Endomondo</a></h2> <p>Recently given a complete design overhaul on the Android version, this popular app is intuitive and easy to use. The web dashboard where you can get an overview of your runs, by comparison, is a bit ugly and fussy in terms of design, plagued by low-rent Google ads as well as constant plugs for its paid-for 'lounge' service to compare yourself against other runners, even if you've bought the Pro version of the app.</p> <p><strong>The good:</strong> Auto pauses when you stop; 'beat my run' mode; clean interface; interval training on Pro version; auto sharing to your Facebook timeline (if you want it) and Twitter (at the start and end of runs, if you like); decent audio updates; classification by workout type (eg can list cycle rides separate to runs).</p> <p><strong>The bad:</strong> Lack of granular control over social media sharing (for example, you have to share a map of your run on your Facebook feed); web dashboard could be clearer; free versions now have ads.</p> <p>\u2022 Available on Android (reviewed) and iOS. Free version available; 'Pro' version costs \u00a33.99.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/\" title=\"\">Nike+</a></h2> <p>While many will hate the 'inspirational' voiceovers from celebrity athletes that you get after breaking a personal best using this app, I loved its cheesy post-run feedback. It's a fun, slickly designed app that in a welcome move puts your pace much more prominently than rivals'. It integrates nicely with your phone's music collection, too.</p> <p><strong>The good:</strong> Smart interface; music support; granular control over social media sharing to Facebook and Twitter; friends can 'cheer' you via Facebook; celebrity feedback; easy to set prominent goals; can recalibrate distance of runs in-app if you know the GPS was wonky.</p> <p><strong>The bad: </strong>Promos for Nike kit; notoriously buggy website with regular log-in problems even after its recent redesign.</p> <p>\u2022 Free. Available on Android (only O2 phones in UK so far) and iOS (reviewed).</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.strava.com/\" title=\"\">Strava</a></h2> <p>The go-to app for cyclists is also excellent for runners. The star attraction is the 'segments' \u2013 sections of a route chosen by one of Strava's users \u2013 that you can compete on a virtual leaderboard against other runners. Whether your GPS will match you properly to the segment is fairly hit and miss \u2013 it was only accurate about half the time in my tests \u2013 but it's far more of a motivator than 'beat yourself' and 'shadow runner'-type modes on the other apps. Clean interface in-app and on the online dash.</p> <p><strong>The good:</strong> Legible audio updates; easy sharing to social networks; well-designed in-app interface and online dashboard; lively online community of users.</p> <p><strong>The bad: </strong>Segment mapping can be hit and miss; audio updates are extremely fast and possible to miss; no auto-sharing to Facebook.</p> <p>\u2022 Free.

The app is ugly as sin, too.</p> <p><strong>The good:</strong> Free app; lots of users online; email alerts; good online dashboard.</p> <p><strong>The bad: </strong>Wonky GPS tracking; ugly app interface.</p> <p>\u2022 Free.

It's stylish, and just about small enough to wear when you're not running, and the interface is surprisingly easy given it only has three buttons. Overall it works well, but the GPS can be frustratingly slow to get a fix at the start of the run, and won't let you start the counter until it has locked on to enough satellites.</p> <p><strong>The good:</strong> The styling; cheesy 'crowd go wild' exhortations at the end of the run; decent accompanying PC software.</p> <p><strong>The bad: </strong>No audio updates; no wireless connectivity; slow to lock on to GPS at start of runs; USB charging only (no mains adapter).</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3130-150.

The option to race against yourself is good, and the lapping and stats options are great.

You can learn much more about late-Victorian London from Conan Doyle than Henry James.</p> <p>True to form, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/26/digested-read-switch-charlie-brooks\" title=\"\">Switch by Charlie Brooks</a>, published by the pioneering Blue Door imprint of Harper Collins, is not only a promising diversion, it tells us quite a bit about its author, the husband of Rebekah Brooks who goes on trial this autumn on charges relating to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">phone-hacking scandal</a>.</p> <p>Mr Brooks has always stood by his wife, asserting her innocence. On the dedication page of Switch, he goes one further. She is, he writes, \"the best wife in the world \u2013 who inspires me with her sense of decency, her clarity of thought and her integrity.\"</p> <p>Immediately before this touching, and slightly defiant tribute, the reader learns that Brooks was educated at Eton, but left '\"to become a stable lad\". Subsequently, he has worked as \"a racehorse trainer\" and a newspaper columnist (for the Daily Telegraph). All in all, a promising CV for a would-be thriller writer.</p> <p>The disappointment of Switch is that almost none of this is explored in what follows. True, we get glimpses of the hero's adulterous girlfriend, Gemma. \"She still took his breath away. Her long flowing hair falling down her back, her dress clinging to her body just enough to be tantalisingly sexy, and best of all those exquisite calf muscles.\"</p> <p>Don't misread this. Gemma is not just good in bed, she is troubled, too. \"She was such a confused soul. Spoilt and self-centred on the one hand, and yet generous and insecure on the other.\"</p> <p>Brooks has read enough thrillers to know that the love-interest should step coquettishly into view no later than chapter two (check), give our hero (Max Ward) the rogering of his life (check), and then hover tantalisingly on the periphery of the action (check), offering up her body for occasional work-outs either in bed, or on a \"very comfortable Moroccan rug\" (check).</p> <p>Students of Charlie Brooks' life and times will be interested to know that Max first met Gemma on \"a typical, wild Gloucestershire weekend party. Everyone drank too much and a few people ended up doing things they shouldn't... Max had followed her upstairs to bed. By the time he knocked on her door, she was wearing the skimpiest of nighties...\"</p> <p>Sadly, Max Ward, happy-go-lucky \"MI6 spook\", does not confine his attentions to sexy Gemma. He's also playing away with Sophie. On top of this, he's whizzing about 21st-century Europe like a fruit fly on speed, pursuing \"a mission\" that involves an old master painting, some unlikely intelligence shenanigans, and a pervasive air of menace. Plainly with a possible movie deal in view, each chapter of Switch opens in another posh EU location. Now Monaco, now Amsterdam, anon London (and, weirdly, Eton). Note to author: cut the flashbacks. They slow the action, and confuse the hell out of the reader.</p> <p>By the not-so-shattering climax of Switch, three things are clear. First, this is really a first draft with several potential stories (all of them under-explored). Second, Brooks has broken the first rule of thrillers: write about what you know. Horses, Gloucestershire, yes. International intelligence, no. His MI6 is, frankly, incredible. Third, the reader cries out for at least one even vaguely likeable, or interesting, character.</p> <p>In place of an engaging cast, Brooks has spun a confusing, over-complicated yarn which comes with dutiful puffs from Jeremy Clarkson (\"a turbo-charged race to the finish\") and Alex James (\"I couldn't put it down\"). Did they, you wonder, actually read it to the end ?</p> <p>I advise Charlie Brooks to flash his copy of Switch en route to court when his wife's trial starts. It will promote sales \u2013 and a leisured re-reading will show him how to do better next time.</p>",

It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them.</p> <p>\"Officials acting on behalf of their royal highnesses are consulting with lawyers to consider what options may be available to the Duke and Duchess.\"</p> <p>\"The Duke and Duchess remain focused currently on their tour of Singapore, Malaysia, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu on behalf of the Queen.\"</p> <p>The couple were staying in Provence at a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen's nephew, ahead of their diamond jubilee tour of south-east Asia and the South Pacific on behalf of the Queen.</p> <p>They did not know anything about the photos until the magazine's website showed an image of its new front cover with a heavily-pixellated image of a woman with dark hair that it claimed was the Duchess, in a bikini, apparently about to remove her top.</p> <p>On Friday morning, the magazine emerged on the streets of Paris with the pictures of Kate.</p> <p>Sources said that royal officials did not make contact with Closer in Paris last night, because the magazine had already come off the printing presses.</p> <p>But St James's Palace was consulting French lawyers, with royal officials saying the publication was \"turning the clock back 15 years\" to when Princess Diana was pursued by paparazzi.</p> <p>It was reported that the photos were offered to British papers last week, but they all turned them down.</p> <p>However, one picture desk executive on a national tabloid said the set of photos being touted around last week were different. \"They were also long lens, but you couldn't see anything. These pictures nobody has seen, as far I am aware,\" the executive said.</p> <p>Page, a photographer who has worked with national newspapers for the past 30 years, said: \"From what I have seen, these photos have been taken from a very long way. Kate and William would have had no idea they were being taken.</p> <p>\"They were on a 640 acre estate in the south of France. I think they would have expected a certain degree of privacy. They were on a private holiday.</p> <p>\"Remember the toe-sucking photos of Fergie, again in the south of France. That is exactly 20 years ago this month and there was a scramble for them. But now there is not a single newspaper in Britain who would publish these pictures.\"</p> <p>The publication of the topless pictures of Kate will not just reignite memories of Princess Diana but will also feed into the Leveson report on the ethics of the press.</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson is currently drafting his final report and recommendations and this controversy will underline the difficulties any future British regulator will have in controlling overseas press and internet publication.</p> <p>Closer's audacious decision to go to press comes just weeks after the US showbusiness website TMZ published photos of a naked Prince Harry cavorting in a Las Vegas hotel room.</p> <p>William and Kate were told about the allegations on Friday morning before they visited the Assyakirin Mosque and had also looked at the images on the Closer website.</p> <p>Speaking about the royal couple, a source said: \"They're saddened their privacy has been breached \u2013 if it has been breached.</p> <p>\"We will talk to our lawyers in London and counterparts in Paris to see what options are available. We're not aware of anyone [in the UK] seeking to publish so the Press Complaints Commission is not coming into it.\"</p> <p>The Sun was the only British newspaper to defy the palace's request not to publish photos of Harry in the nude with an unnamed woman.</p> <p>Prince Charles had issued the request to newspapers, via the PCC, along with a letter from his personal lawyers at Harbottle &amp; Lewis warning them that he had an expectation of privacy under English law, saying there is no possible justification for printing the photos apart from prurience.</p> <p>In 1994 the German Bild magazine published photos of Prince Charles naked on a balcony while on holiday at a French chateau near Avignon, but no British papers published them.</p> <p>French Closer was launched in 2005 as a version of the British magazine then owned by UK publishing company Emap. It was sold in 2006 to Mondadori France, a subsidiary of an Italian company, and sells 400,000 copies a week.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Personally I see a buoyant, active manufacturing sector in which growth has to be managed in a sensible way, especially with threats of further economic turmoil in Europe.</p> <p><strong>Pick the right premises:</strong> Last year we consolidated from two smaller premises to one larger one. The lease on the larger premises was considerably cheaper than the two \u2013 mainly down to commercial property being much more available now than when we signed the lease on the smaller units and is therefore much cheaper.

Mainly due to our clients demanding more to meet their customers' needs. The biggest problem we have (and I'm sure other manufacturers do as well) is getting skilled staff.

  "<p>There's nothing that newspapers like more than discussing sex and disgusting stuff so a group of psychologists in the Netherlands have come up with the perfect research; <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0044111\" title=\"\">arouse some women, get them to do disgusting stuff and see what happens</a>. It was a little more sedate than the bushtucker trial on I'm a Celebrity\u2026 but possibly as pointless. The researchers claim that women's aversion to \"disgusting\" things is lessened when they are sexually aroused. Which is good, the scientists say, because sex is a bit disgusting. Leading to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2202711/Study-finds-sexually-aroused-women-easily-disgusted.html?openGraphAuthor=%2Fhome%2Fsearch.html%3Fs%3D%26authornamef%3DEddie%2BWrenn\" title=\"\">\"So that's how they put up with men!\"</a> headlines. Apparently \"saliva, sweat, semen and body odours are among the strongest disgust elicitors\" which makes it remarkable that we go at it like bunnies given half the chance when we're in fact meaty little sacks of saliva and sweat. Well no, it isn't that remarkable.</p> <p>Clearly, what people find disgusting varies massively. I find mayonnaise disgusting. It is vile, it stinks and it makes everything it touches taste 100 times worse. However, I recognise that the entire pre-packaged sandwich market disagrees with me. But I am aware that my disgust is subjective (and that the rest of you are weird).</p> <p>The research itself was bizarre. They selected 90 university student women and put them into three groups. One of the groups of women was shown porn (sorry, an \"erotic film\"); one group extreme sports (which was supposed to excite them but not sexually); and the other group were shown a film of a train (something neutral and not arousing or exciting).</p> <p>All of the women were heterosexual and had no \"sexual dysfunction\" but researchers didn't seem to check whether they were disgusted by or simply not turned on by porn. It might have been rubbish erotica and the fact that it was called \"de Gast\" (The Guest) makes me imagine it was set in the 80s and involved women in pearls and men in deck shoes (no one can get aroused by a man in deck shoes). Even those in the \"non-aroused\" groups might actually be turned on by watching exciting sports or might be train fetishists (yes, yes, they do exist and you can go to <a href=\"http://www.tokyomango.com/tokyo_mango/2008/03/new-fetish-cafe.html\" title=\"\">a train fetish cafe</a> in, not unsurprisingly, Japan). The participants then had to watch their film for a few minutes, carry out a \"disgusting\" task, watch the film for a few more minutes, do another task and repeat with a total of 16 tasks. I certainly couldn't maintain a lady-boner through that. A text message is enough to distract me from my solitary arousal.</p> <p>Some of the \"disgusting\" tasks they were asked to perform didn't strike me as particularly disgusting. Lubricating a vibrator? I mean, I wouldn't want to do it in front of my mum but I don't see why it would be \"disgusting\".</p> <p>But that's the point. What is disgusting?</p> <p>Saliva is disgusting if it is spat out of the mouth of a fascist on a rightwing march. When you cut your finger as a child and your Mum put it in her mouth to stem the flow, that was fine. Views on saliva and spitting are even different across cultures, indeed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/world/asia/17iht-web-0417china.5314587.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">the Chinese had to be told to stop spitting</a> in the run up to the 2008 Olympics.</p> <p>Assuming that everyone finds saliva, sweat, and semen disgusting is not only conjecture, it also overlooks some really fringe stuff that people are into sexually. I think that it is safe to say that most of us are disgusted by poo. Generally speaking, in every context you care to mention, I will say \"No thank you\" to the offer of a turd. However, I am fully aware that there are people who are scatologically inclined. I would even be willing to bet that some people involve mayonnaise in their love-making \u2013 they are, I believe, the true perverts.</p> <p>But I think with this study, the highlighting of semen is the dog-whistle. I can't get away from the feeling that it is trying to hint at the fact that the only reason why women give blow-jobs is because they are aroused to the point of non-disgust. This plays on the assumptions that women just aren't that into sex, that semen and oral sex are to be considered disgusting, and that women therefore have to be biologically \"tricked\" into the unpleasantness of sex.</p> <p>Well no.</p> <p>Sexual arousal and disgust are as affected by social factors as biological ones. Disgust can be defined by culture, time, context, class, gender and religion. And there is little on earth more variable than what people are sexually aroused by. So I find the researcher's quandary as to \"why people still manage to engage in pleasurable sex despite the disgusting nature of many stimuli that are implicated in sexual behaviours\" more revealing about their views on disgust and sex. Either that or they just have really filthy sex.</p>",

  "<p>Here we go again... now it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/14/kate-william-furious-topless-photographs\">Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, getting the paparazzi treatment</a>, just as her late mother-in-law did 15 years ago and her brother-in-law did just a couple of weeks ago.</p> <p>No wonder the Duchess and her husband, Prince William, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19595221\">are reported to be furious.</a> With memories of Princess Diana in mind, they must feel history is repeating itself.</p> <p>The statement issued by the Palace this morning, calling the privacy intrusion \"grotesque and totally unjustifiable\", makes an explicit reference to Diana:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly, British newspapers and magazines refused to publish the topless pictures of Kate because it would be a blatant breach of the editors' code of practice to do so.</p> <p>The photos were obviously taken without the Duchess's consent, and they were snapped in a place where she and her husband had, to quote the code, \"a reasonable expectation of privacy.\"</p> <p>As for \"the public interest\", there is no earthly way of constructing an argument to justify publication on such grounds.</p> <p>The Kate pictures are different from those involving Prince Harry, who was pictured last month while naked in a Las Vegas hotel.</p> <p>Though The Sun advanced a public interest defence for publishing the Harry picture, it was very specific to the circumstances. </p> <p>Aside from its argument that the pictures were \"in the public domain\" by virtue of having been published on many websites, the paper claimed there were security implications and questions about his position in the army. <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/article4502239.ece\">\"We believe Harry has compromised his own privacy,\"</a> it said.</p> <p>That paper thin argument to justify publication would not be possible in relation to the Kate pictures.</p> <p>Nor is it a matter of newspapers giving special privileges to royalty. One key decision taken by the Press Complaints Commission about sneak pictures of people in a private place dates back to 2001 and involved the DJ Sara Cox. She was pictured nude on a private beach on an island in the Seychelles.</p> <p>The PCC did not adjudicate because <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/feb/25/thepeople.mondaymediasection\">it convinced the offending paper, The People, to apologise</a>, and Cox went on to sue the paper, which eventually<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/jun/07/pressandpublishing.privacy\"> paid her and her husband \u00a350,000 in an out-of-court settlement.</a> </p> <p>Similarly, Amanda Holden and her then husband, Les Dennis, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/dec/21/pressandpublishing.humanrights\">were paid \u00a340,000 in an out-of-court settlement </a>after the Daily Star published sneak photographs of them. Neither were legal precedents, because they didn't go to trial.</p> <p>The editors' code certainly did draw a line between public places and private places, offering a large measure of protection for the latter. </p> <p>It is interesting that the pictures of Kate and William are appearing in a French magazine because France has very strict privacy laws. Presumably the magazine, Closer, is willing to take the legal heat should the prince and his wife decide to sue.</p> <p>It is also sobering to recall that Diana's death in 1997 occurred in France when she was being pursued by the paparazzi. (Incidentally, she was not pictured topless. She was pictured in a bikini while pregnant - by newspaper staff photographers - and there were many other bikini shots taken by paparazzi over the years).</p> <p>Finally, some callers to radio phone-in programmes this morning have indicated that there could be a public backlash should any British publication dare to publish sneak pictures of the Duchess. I would doubt that. Hypocrisy in this matter runs deep. </p> <p>But the British-based version of Closer - published by Bauer Media - had better watch out. Despite its French namesake being owned by a different company - Silvio Berlusconi's Mondadori - it could just find itself being punished by a boycott.</p>",
  "<p>One in four people in Britain feel they have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/04/quarter-people-ripped-off-lettings-agents-shelter?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">charged unfair fees by a letting agent</a> according to research published by housing charity Shelter.</p> <p>The reason the fees were felt to be unfair was that they bore no relationship to the amount of work done by the agent. Tenancy renewal fees are a good example. How much does it cost a letting agent to change the date and print off a new contract to be signed? Can that really be worth \u00a390?</p> <p>Shelter's research echoes <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/media/downloads/Renting_in_the_Dark.pdf\" title=\"Renting in the Dark (pdf)\">the findings of a mystery shopping exercise</a> the Resolution Foundation published last year. We contacted 25 letting agents in London, Manchester and Gloucester, including national and local brands. We found huge variation in the types and levels of fees charged.</p> <p>Administration fees ranged from \u00a390 to \u00a3375. A third of agents charged a tenancy renewal fee, while the rest did not. Some agents charged a separate reference check fee, while others rolled it into the administration fee. The biggest problem for tenants is that most agents don't tell you what fees they charge upfront on their website so you can't avoid those who charge the most. And in a market where demand outstrips supply, the option to go elsewhere does not always exist.</p> <p>The funny thing about letting agents is that they don't seem to be all that popular with either tenants or landlords. It would be easy to understand a model whereby they worked well for landlords but not for tenants. Yet a lot of larger landlords try not to use them, preferring to find their own tenants. Clearly, this isn't true of all agents but the growth of websites that allow landlords to rate tenants and vice-versa partly reflects the perceived failings of letting agents.</p> <p>Industry experts argue that there's a simple solution. Tenants just need to make sure they only use accredited agents. But with the private rented sector now the second largest tenure in our housing market, it is not clear that self-regulation is enough.</p> <p>This is not a government that likes regulation, quite the opposite. But there is a case for putting letting agents on the same footing as estate agents to reflect the housing market we now have. This would involve bringing letting agents under the definition of an estate agency with the Estate Agents Act to give the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) the ability to ban agents who act improperly. This is hardly controversial. The industry itself has called for it.</p> <p>Putting letting agents on an equal footing with estate agents would get rid of the worst parts of the market. At the moment, the OFT could close you down as an estate agent today and you could open up as a letting agent tomorrow. To make the market more transparent for tenants and landlords, so that they know what fees they will incur upfront, agents should be required to be members of an ombudsman service and, as part of membership, to publish their fees in advance and in a comparable form.</p> <p>The private rented sector is arguably the Cinderella tenure in the housing market. Now that it has overtaken social housing, it is time to focus on making it work better for people who will make it their home for the medium to long term, not simply pass through. Making letting agents fairer and more transparent is just one part of what needs to be done.</p> <p><em>Vidhya Alekeson is director of research and strategy at the </em><a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Resolution Foundation</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>My 15 minute walk to work takes me through London's historic heart of medicine and dentistry, into Cavendish Square, the home of the <a href=\"http://www.medicalprotection.org/uk\" title=\"\">Medical Protection Society</a>'s (MPS) London office. One of the joys of this role is that no two days are the same. Although I am based in London, I may be in our offices in Leeds or Edinburgh or meeting members in other countries.</p> <p>MPS is a mutual membership organisation, providing advice, assistance and professional indemnity to more than 270,000 doctors, dentists and health professionals around the world, including the UK, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.</p> <p>My role includes ensuring that members are supported with the legal and ethical problems that arise from their professional practice including clinical negligence claims, complaints, disciplinary processes and inquests.</p> <p>A key part of MPS's work is informing and influencing the statutory and regulatory framework in which clinicians practise. Responding to consultation documents and meeting with departments of health, colleges and medical councils in all countries in which we offer membership ensures that we maintain a dialogue with decision makers. We find that our international experience is helpful to the development of public policy for the benefit of members and their patients.</p> <p>These meetings are generally scheduled well in advance, but the day is punctuated by current issues. These can be as diverse as whether we should defend a particular clinical negligence case to trial, the pros and cons of a legal challenge in a disciplinary procedure or the expectations on a doctor when faced with a patient's request for a report in order to seek assisted suicide. This latter aspect was one which caused significant concern to GP members and is an example of where we are able to provide guidance to members when faced with such ethical dilemmas.</p> <p>Our team of about fifty doctors are specialists in legal medicine and take nearly 20,000 telephone calls for advice every year.</p> <p>One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is speaking with groups of doctors across the world, through our educational programmes. Although there are differences from country to country, many of the medicolegal issues are universal. I often see a doctor experience that 'light bulb moment' during a presentation or workshop and I know that the training will make a difference to how they provide care.</p> <p>At these events I am often asked how I became involved in this area of medicine. For me it was as a result of an interest in medical law and forensics during my time in GP and hospital medicine. MPS recruits regularly and we look for doctors with a sound clinical background who want to combine that with legal training and qualifications.</p> <p>Education, not just in clinical skills but also in how we communicate effectively, is key to reducing the rising numbers of claims and the adverse impact that claims can have on public confidence in healthcare. In recent years we have seen a significant rise in the cost and frequency of clinical negligence claims. The NHSLA paid over \u00a31.2bn last year to compensate NHS patients and we have seen over 40% more claims against UK GPs than the comparable position last year.</p> <p>When something goes wrong, it is absolutely right that patients receive fair compensation, it is what doctors want and why we exist, but in 7 out of 10 claims the claimant's lawyer receives more than the patient. This cannot be acceptable, particularly at a time when the NHS is so financially constrained. We shared our experiences to help shape the civil litigation reforms that are being implemented to address disproportionate legal costs.</p> <p>One of the benefits of city living is the accessibility of entertainment and so my day ends with ample opportunity to indulge my passion for theatre and in particular, live comedy.</p> <p><em>If you know someone in healthcare who you would like us to feature in our Five minutes with ... series, let us know by </em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>emailing us</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails on the future of the health sector.</strong></p>",
  "<p>South Yorkshire police, the force at the centre of the Hillsborough disaster cover-up, has set in motion a process that could see serving and former officers face criminal charges.</p> <p>The force said it was preparing to refer the conduct of its officers during and after the disaster, in which 96 football fans died, to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The police watchdog can make recommendations to the Crown Prosecution Service to charge officers for their part in what the Hillsborough independent panel report on Wednesday identified as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-police-coverup-revealed\" title=\"\">an orchestrated cover-up and smear campaign against the victims</a>.</p> <p>The IPCC could also investigate disciplinary breaches by the officers, but there are obstacles in the way of taking action against those involved in wrongdoing because most have now left the service.</p> <p>The panel \u2013 which had unprecedented access to 450,000 documents \u2013 uncovered the true scale of the South Yorkshire police cover-up, which began in the hours after the fans were crushed to death at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.</p> <p>Fresh evidence showed 116 police statements were doctored, victims were tested for blood alcohol levels and checks were carried out on the police national computer to access criminal records in order \"to impugn the reputation of the deceased\".</p> <p>Amid growing calls for criminal charges to be brought, South Yorkshire police said they were reviewing matters raised in the panel's report \"with a view to making a referral\" to the IPCC. Any referral requires them to identify officers and any offences they may have committed.</p> <p>The announcement came after the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, called for a criminal investigation to be overseen by the watchdog.</p> <p>\"We are asking the Home Office to set out a proper separate investigation into the cover-up and what happened in South Yorkshire police, including looking at criminal charges,\" she said. \"At Hillsborough, people who should have been protected were betrayed and justice was denied.\"</p> <p>The move to mount an investigation came as one of the last serving senior police officers involved in the Hillsborough operation rejected calls for his resignation. Sir Norman Bettison, the chief constable of West Yorkshire police, was a key member of a five-strong internal inquiry team at South Yorkshire accused of engaging in a black propaganda campaign against fans to shift blame from the police.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/hillsborough-report-norman-bettison-refuses-resign\" title=\"\">Bettison said he had \"nothing to hide\"</a> and would not step down. He risked raising the wrath of the victims' families further when he said: \"Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be.\" He denied any part in doctoring statements.</p> <p>But his employer, the West Yorkshire police authority, said it was mounting an internal investigation into the matters raised in the report to assess what action should be taken.</p> <p>The IPCC said in a statement it would be reviewing the panel's report, which raised \"extremely serious and troubling issues for the police\".</p> <p>\"There is a huge amount of information contained within the report and supporting documentation that needs to be analysed and digested.\"</p> <p>The attorney general, Dominic Grieve, will decide in the coming weeks whether to order a new inquest after the original, which recorded verdicts of accidental death, was found severely lacking by the panel. But any new inquest could be severely delayed if an IPCC investigation leads to criminal charges. The inquest would only be held after the completion of any prosecutions.</p> <p>Criminal offences which could be investigated include perverting the course of justice in the doctoring of police witness statements, misconduct in public office and manslaughter.</p> <p>South Yorkshire's chief constable, David Crompton, said on Thursday the issue of criminal responsibility for the changing of statements was the same as in any other situation.</p> <p>\"If someone has falsified something and it breaches the criminal law then, fair enough, that applies to anybody, whether it's in relation to Hillsborough or anything else. They should face prosecution, let's be clear about it,\" he said.</p> <p>Two officers involved in the Hillsborough tragedy have already been prosecuted in a private case brought by the Hillsborough support group.</p> <p>Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield \u2013 the officer in charge on the day \u2013 was tried for unlawful killing but in 2000 a jury failed to reach a verdict and he never faced a retrial. His second in command on the day, former superintendent Bernard Murray was found not guilty of two counts of unlawful killing.</p> <p>Many of those who might have faced charges are now dead, including the chief constable at the time, Peter Wright, who died last year having been awarded an OBE and CBE.</p> <p>Paul Middup, one of the officers responsible for a series of allegations about the drunken behaviour of the fans which led to the Sun headline, \"The Truth\", said at a meeting of the South Yorkshire police federation that Wright had given him a \"free hand\" to defend the police.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian on Thursday, Middup said he did not want to comment.</p> <p>Former South Yorkshire police constable Richard Wells, who led the force after the disaster, said prosecutions were essential.</p> <p>\"Wherever the best legal minds available to us and to the government are able to establish good clear evidence for a sustainable prosecution of anybody regardless of rank, regardless of whether they are still serving or retired, that should happen,\" he said. \"That's the only way we are going to lance this constantly festering boil.\"</p> <p>Recriminations grew on Thursday as the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, called for Sir Irvine Patnick, the former Tory MP who was involved in the police cover-up campaign, to be stripped of his knighthood. Patnick, who was one of the sources for the Sun's coverage, said he was \"deeply and sincerely sorry\".</p>",

Photograph: Nasa/JPL-Caltech/MSSS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the moment the scientists have been waiting for. Nasa's Mars Curiosity rover will begin driving today in search of the first rock to analyse with its robot arm. After five and a half weeks of instrument checks, software updates and test drives, today the scientists take over from the engineers.</p> <p>Searching for the right rock could take days or weeks depending upon what the rover happens to pass. Curiosity will make slow but steady progress, driving at no more than 40 metres per Martian day, or sol as the scientists call them, before radioing its progress back to Earth.</p> <p>From now on, the science team will meet as soon as the data is received to determine what has been achieved and what they would like to do next. This could be driving to a new location, analysing a rock or soil sample, or taking images.</p> <p>The decision-making process is split across two eight-hour shifts. During the first, the scientists make a plan that the engineers check to ensure it is achievable. During the second, programmers build the command sequences necessary to make the plan happen. These are uploaded to Mars and Curiosity sets about following them, while the ground team grabs some rest.</p> <p>If anything unexpected happens, perhaps Curiosity tilts beyond a preset limit or slips too much in the dust while moving, then it will stop what it's doing, send its status back to Earth and await further instructions.</p> <p>The science mission begins with Curiosity in excellent shape, and with an operating crew brimming with confidence. During a <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/25360845\">teleconference</a> on Wednesday, Jennifer Trosper, the mission manager from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told how the expertise built up across previous rover missions was paying off.</p> <p>During 1997's Mars Pathfinder mission, one in three sols were lost because something happened unexpectedly and the rover halted operations. During the Spirit and Opportunity rover missions, which landed in 2004, lost sols were down to just one in 10. So far, Curiosity has clocked up 37 sols on the Martian surface yet they are just a single sol over their expected mission plan.</p> <p>Ironically, given the amount of geological instrumentation on the rover, today's first scientific observation will not be looking down at rocks but up into the sky. Twice every Martian year (which is about twice as long as an Earth year), Mars's largest moon, Phobos, slips across the face of the Sun. It happens today and the team will try to record the event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396152188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347556096312/PIA05554.jpg\" alt=\"Martian moon Phobos silhouetted against the Sun\" width=\"220\" height=\"201\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity took this image of Martian moon Phobos slipping across the face of the Sun in 2004. Photograph: Nasa/JPL/Cornell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/JPL/Cornell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Previous Martian missions, such as Spirit and Opportunity, caught pictures of such transits but this is the first time Nasa will attempt video footage. They will use one of Curiosity's <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/08/curiosity-mars-rover-cameras/\">17 cameras</a> and they will have to be quick. Phobos orbits Mars once every 7.6 hours and crosses the face of the Sun in just 30 seconds. To check for success, a few test images will be downloaded first before the whole movie at a later date.</p> <p>Then Curiosity begins to \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/13/curiosity-rover-drive-martian-life\">drive, drive, drive</a>\". Today is not the first time the rover has driven. There was a 13-sol period during the checking out phase called the intermission when Curiosity drove 109 metres to test its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/22/mars-rover-nasa-curiosity-test-drive?intcmp=239\">ability to manoeuvre</a>. Today, however, the driving begins in earnest.</p> <p>Using just 115 Watts of power \u2013 a little more than a traditional, bright lightbulb \u2013&#xa0;it will head for a rock formation dubbed Glenelg. Ostensibly named after a rock formation in Yellowknife, Canada, Nasa also chose the name because it is a palindrome and they plan to visit the <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/blogs/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowBlogs&amp;BlogsID=246\">formation twice</a>.</p> <p>Wherever they go after this first foray, they will have to pass by Glenelg again from the opposite direction when they turn around and head back to their primary target, Mt Sharp. Why not just head straight there? Even on Mars, it seems, the temptation to take the scenic route is irresistible.</p> <p>Let the science begin!</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com\">Stuart Clark</a> is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846972157\">The Sky's Dark Labyrinth</a> (Polygon)</em></p>",

  "<p>One of Britain's most unusual \u2013 and in some ways, most daring \u2013 co-operatives comprises more than 8,800 people. They have together put about \u00a328m of their money into a fund that in turn has lent it out worldwide to support fair trade farmers and producers.</p> <p>The co-op's name is <a href=\"http://www.shared-interest.com/\" title=\"\">Shared Interest</a>, the name reflecting the principle that has guided it since 1990 when it was set up with help from the pioneering fair trade venture <a href=\"http://www.traidcraft.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Traidcraft</a>. Shared Interest helps fair trade farmers' and producers' groups with the working capital they need to get their crops grown and harvested during the long wait to receive the money for the produce they eventually sell. It means that Shared Interest's loans may be used to buy seeds and fertiliser, farm equipment and vehicles, or even to pay the costs of replanting exhausted crops.</p> <p>Bankers would no doubt be appalled at Shared Interest's cheerful defiance of conventional lending prudence. The co-operative lends primarily to small business ventures, often in developing countries and usually without taking collateral as security. This is, as Shared Interest's managing director Patricia Alexander accepts, a risky line of business, something she says her members fully understand. \"We don't want people to put their life savings in,\" she makes clear.</p> <p>Shared Interest does have its own ways of being prudent, however. The key to its operation, Alexander says, is the strong link between fair trade producers and fair trade buyers and importers. \"We're very keenly concerned with the relationship between the producer group and the buyer, because that's essentially our security,\" she says. As she explains, Shared Interest typically gets its money back not from the producers but directly from the buyers, from part of the funds due for the produce being purchased.</p> <h2>Advance working capital</h2> <p>Fair trade has boomed in Britain in recent years, the overall market having doubled in two years. With companies such as Cadbury's and Sainsbury's \u2013 and of course the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/food/food-and-drink/food/Fairtrade/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group</a> \u2013 endorsing fair trade, it might seem curious that there is a still a need for a small operator such as Shared Interest. But according to Alexander, the lack of available capital remains acute for fair trade producers. Choosing her words with care, she points out that many larger manufacturers and retailers acquire fairly traded goods through intermediaries who do not offer to advance working capital. \"Gaining access to the market is most important [for producers], but it's a shame that more larger organisations don't offer pre-finance,\" she says. She adds that the demand for loans from Shared Interest far outruns the resources currently available from members' deposits.</p> <p>The coffee farmers' co-operative in the southern Mexican town of Huatusco is one of those groups who have come to Shared Interest for working capital. The co-op is able as a consequence to pay its farmers in advance of the harvest, protecting them from having to sell their crops at prices dictated by two large transnational coffee businesses that operate in the market nearby. The co-operative has also been able to sponsor 80 local young people to attend a local university (the deal is that once they graduatethey work initially to help strengthen the co-op).</p> <p>Coffee, as in Huatusco, is the most important crop in Shared Interest's loan portfolio, followed some distance behind by cocoa and fruit (handicrafts is also significant). But as well as lending direct to fair trade producer groups, Shared Interest also helps the fair trade movement more generally by lending to fair trade buying organisations. One example is the Ottawa-based co-operative <a href=\"http://www.lasiembra.com/camino/\" title=\"\">La Siembra</a>, which markets the Camino range of fair trade chocolate bars and produce to the Canadian market. The producer/buyer split in Shared Interest's total loan book is currently about 40:60 although Shared Interest is rapidly trying to increase the share of its lending in developing countries. It has recently appointed staff in Peru, Kenya and Ghana to help this process.</p> <h2>Tough times</h2> <p>The recent global downturn has given the fair trade movement its own challenges. Somewhat unfortunately (not least given its name) Shared Interest's members have had to accept a 0% rate of return on their investments since 2009, although Alexander says that her board is hoping to reinstitute interest on deposits next year. As an Industrial &amp; Provident Society cooperative, Shared Interest's maximum member deposit is set by law at \u00a320,000 although the average individual investment is in fact a relatively modest \u00a33,000 or so. But Shared Interest's members do appear to care very deeply about the work their co-operative undertakes: almost two hundred turned up for the AGM earlier this year, and there is also a team of active volunteers who promote Shared Interest's work. Shared Interest's Board of Directors is aided and scrutinised by a nine-strong members' Council. In an interesting innovation to the practice of co-operative governance, Shared Interest regularly draws at random the name of one of its members and invites them to join the Council. (Most agree.)</p> <p>Alexander is particularly keen to bring more younger people in as members of the co-operative, the average age currently being over 60. \"A lot of people give money to charity, but by putting money into Shared Interest it gets used again and again, allowing people to help themselves and to gain respect,\" she says. With over 20 years' trading history behind it, Shared Interest has demonstrated that high principles can also work out in practice.</p> <p><em>Andrew Bibby is a professional writer and journalist</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The former police chief who triggered a dramatic political upheaval in China, toppling his former patron Bo Xilai, will go on trial on Tuesday morning for defection, abuse of power and other offences.</p> <p>Wang Lijun, the vice mayor of Chongqing, in south-west China, fled to the US consulate in Chengdu in February.</p> <p>He told diplomats that he believed Bo's wife Gu Kailai had poisoned British businessman Neil Heywood - a death that had up until then been ascribed to excessive alcohol consumption. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/gu-kailai-suspended-death-sentence\">Gu was convicted of Heywood's murder last month</a> and handed a suspended death sentence.</p> <p>A spokesman at Chengdu Intermediate People's Court confirmed Wang's<br>case would be heard on Tuesday, adding: \"We will release news [about<br>the trial] in a timely manner.\"</p> <p>The case comes weeks before a once-a-decade leadership transition is expected to take place, and takes the party one step closer to drawing a line under the country's biggest political scandal for decades.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/bo-xilai-police-chief-charged\">The announcement of Wang's indictment</a> did not mention Bo, the former Chongqing party secretary. But officials say the charges against him are striking because they relate to his actions in office and therefore raise questions about his former boss's behaviour.</p> <p>According to state news agency Xinhua, prosecutors have charged Wang with \"bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking\", adding that the evidence was \"concrete and abundant\".</p> <p>Bo had hired Wang, who had a reputation as a gang-busting policeman, to spearhead a dramatic crackdown on organised crime. But critics said the campaign trampled over the law and resulted in widespread abuses.</p> <p>The politician, who some thought might win promotion in this year's leadership crackdown, has not been seen since March, when authorities said he was under investigation for unspecified disciplinary offences.</p> <p>While some analysts think the party's leaders will prefer to deal with Bo using internal mechanisms, others suggest the charges against Wang are a hint that he could yet face a criminal trial.</p>"
