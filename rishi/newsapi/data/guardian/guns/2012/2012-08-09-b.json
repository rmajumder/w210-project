  "<p>\"An impudent little man in horsehair\" may well fit many disappointed litigants' description of a judge, but publishing it could land you in prison for up to two years for the offence of scandalising the court. The Birmingham Daily Argus, who described a judge as such in 1900, was punished with a fine of \u00a3100 plus costs for the arcane form of contempt of court.</p> <p>The offence, which affords special protection to the judiciary, may be abolished following a <a href=\"http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/consultations/scandalising.htm\">consultation by the Law Commission</a> which opens on Friday. The law reform body is investigating the offence, which dates from 1765, following the attempted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/17/peter-hain-contempt-case-dropped\" title=\"\">prosecution of former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain</a> this year. The Labour MP criticised Lord Justice Girvan's handling of a judicial review application in his autobiography, describing the judge as \"off his rocker\". Although the charge was dropped, the case provoked a debate as to whether the offence of scandalising the court was in breach of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects free expression.</p> <p>Lord Pannick proposed an <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2012-2013/0004/amend/ml004-v.htm\">amendment</a> abolishing the offence to the crime and courts bill, which has prompted the review. Scandalising the judiciary \u2013 or murmuring judges, as it is known in Scotland \u2013 has not been successfully prosecuted in England and Wales since 1931, but is more common in former colonies that have adopted the UK's system of common law.</p>",

  "<p>The idea of elected police chiefs was always controversial, but \u2013 unlike with, say, NHS reorganisation \u2013 it at least had a comprehensible aim. The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-12/policereformandsocialresponsibility.html\" title=\"\">legislation</a> went through without too much noise, and the elections are set for November. But now two snags have emerged. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/09/magistrates-banned-police-commissioner-elections\" title=\"\">Magistrates have been barred from standing</a> \u2013 a stricture affecting several Conservative candidates \u2013 and one eminently qualified Labour runner, Bob Ashford, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/08/bob-ashford-labour-police-commissioner\" title=\"\">has withdrawn</a> because an ancient teenage transgression leaves him falling foul of unforgiving rules.</p> <p>A few weeks before an expected reshuffle, and a few weeks after the G4S debacle, the mix-up over magistrates is more serious for Theresa May. It is a headache for her own party that reinforces her reputation as a just-in-time home secretary. Lord Justice Goldring's guidance, which ruled magistrates out, caught her department on the hop. It is defensible, even desirable, to insist on a separation between the bench in court and the police force that hauls people before it. But this is a big change: police authorities are currently positively required to include magistrates. It is extraordinary that the home office rammed through a law allowing a judge to bar magistrates without foreseeing that this might happen.</p> <p>It is the debarring of Mr Ashford, however, that is the more damning indictment of the whole tenor of our criminal justice debate. Having been director of strategy for the Youth Justice Board, he would have brought more insight than most to the directly elected commissioner post. His experience of ending up on the wrong side of the law as a young boy, through some ill-advised trespassing on a railway, would only have added to that. Half a century on, it would be no bar on applying for an ordinary job \u2013 or on standing for parliament. Indeed, MP Eric Joyce continues to sit on the green benches after <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-17310549\" title=\"\">being convicted for assault</a> and later <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2183892/I-cut-electronic-tag-Commons-Vs-Lords-boat-race-MP-Eric-Joyce-fined-600-removing-device.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">removing the electronic tag</a> fitted to him as a result; there would be no constitutional bar on him becoming home secretary and assuming oversight of the police as a whole. But such is Westminster's bipartisan bloodlust against law-breakers beyond its walls that Labour MPs lined up with Tories to make sure that past offences such as Mr Ashford's would scar would-be commissioners for life. Falklands hero Simon Weston \u2013 surely a dream populist candidate \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/02/simon-weston-police-crime-commissioner\" title=\"\">has also felt moved to withdraw</a>. He was fined \u00a330 aged 14.</p> <p>Our prime minister is only one of the top politicians whose alleged youthful <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1542377/Cameron-from-Eton-drugs-to-Oxford-excess.html\" title=\"\">dabbling with drugs</a> put them on the wrong side. The only difference between them and someone with a conviction is that they were never caught in a way that landed them in court. Ethically speaking, it is a Rizla paper of a distinction. Our politicians ought to be as forgiving about the pasts of others as they are about themselves.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/gu-kailai-murder-trial-neil-heywood\" title=\"\">biggest murder trial in China for decades </a>flashed past our screens, and almost entirely below Chinese ones, leaving the outside world little the wiser about the essential facts of the case. What was the \"ample evidence\" against Gu Kailai, the wife of the disgraced political high flier Bo Xilai, who did not contest allegations that she had poisoned the British businessman Neil Heywood? Whose other crimes did she inform on, and could this be a precursor to her husband facing criminal charges? And why had all reference been dropped to Gu's alleged economic crimes? What had happened to Gu the greedy wife converting her husband's political empire into hard cash?</p> <p>A window on the intrigue-filled world of the Chinese elite that had been blown open all those months ago by the unexpected arrival of Wang Lijun, Bo's police chief, in the US consulate in Chengdu, closed firmly yesterday. China's Communist leaders wanted us to believe that this was a simple and uncontested criminal trial of a ruthless woman. To make the point they chose a court well away from both Beijing and Chongqing, the mega-city Bo ruled. The trial was barely given a mention on China's main television news broadcasts last night. Was this a display of collective confidence, or of collective nerves?</p> <p>The Bo affair was never just about the fall of a charismatic princeling, the son of a revolutionary hero, who had grown too big for his boots. It was also about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/opinion/in-china-fear-at-the-top.html?_r=1\" title=\"\">succession</a>. Before the scandal broke, Bo was to have exercised his natural right to one of the nine places on the standing committee of the politburo at the forthcoming 18th Chinese Communist party congress. The collective transition to a new generation of leaders had already been dubbed \"seamless\". It is not, now, but the internal crisis that Bo sparked remains China's most closely guarded state secret. It is said that Bo had high-placed backers, like the security chief Zhou Yongkang. A report by the Financial Times that Zhou had been sidelined as a result of Bo's purge was swiftly contradicted by news that Zhou had been picked to represent Xinjiang region at the congress where the new generation of leaders would be confirmed in post. There may be no smoke without fire, but whose political interests are going up in flames remains as ever opaque. What can be safely assumed is that succession is a work in progress and that the demise of a politician as able and as loud as Bo may have suited not just the quiet moderately reformist old guard but the new one too.</p> <p>The biggest question left by the trial yesterday is what will happen to Bo, who has been suspended from the central committee pending investigation of \"serious disciplinary violations\". The narrative created by his wife's trial, the implication that she suffered from depression, that she acted out of a perceived threat to her son, all diverts attention away from deeper questions about the economic and political power Bo wielded. The famed Chongqing model \u2013 increased state control launched on the back of a sweeping campaign against organised crime \u2013 has disappeared with Bo. But how many other Chinese leaders could suffer the same fate with their political and commercial empires? Bo's fate is a warning to anyone else contemplating breaking ranks.</p> <p>The palace intrigues of the heirs to China's throne matter hugely. If one were to place a bet about where the next geostrategic confrontation will lie, it would not be in the Middle East or even Africa but the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/north-east-asia/china.aspx\" title=\"\">South China Sea</a>. Competing territorial claims for the 2m square miles of oil- and gas-rich waters have so far involved minor skirmishes between fishing boats and coastal protection vessels. But with Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia all involved in the dispute, and with China claiming the entire sea, it was perhaps only a matter of time before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/china-us-south-china-sea\" title=\"\">a war of words </a>erupted between China and the US. China is thought to be backing its territorial claims by building four carrier fleets. It will need cool heads in Beijing to manage that power.</p>",
  "<p>This restoration of Hitchcock's 1926 silent melodrama offers a gripping prehistory not just of his own work, but the Hollywood thriller itself. Ivor Novello plays the lodger, living in a boarding house in pre-first world war London where people are terrified of a serial killer called the Avenger who murders young blondes. The lodger is a strange, tortured figure whose neurotic sensitivity and vulnerability begins to entrance the landlady's pretty daughter Daisy (June Tripp), who is being courted by Joe (Malcolm Keen), a police detective on the killer's trail. But might not this lodger, with his mysterious nighttime excursions, be the killer himself? Novello's haunted appearance is a ghostly premonition of Robert Donat in The 39 Steps and Anthony Perkins in Psycho. The initial sequence, showing how news of the murders is disseminated in the press, is brilliant, and there is a flash of pure Hitchcock genius in the lodger's ambiguous disgust and excitement at seeing Joe playfully put Daisy in handcuffs. The ending is arguably a little anti-climactic, but with its sheer brio and control, this is a vital rerelease.</p>",
  "<p>In 2001 I bought a flat in the ex-council block where I'd been living since leaving university. A kind friend with an empty boot offered me a lift to B&amp;Q to get some flooring. We didn't get further than the end of the street because a group of local kids decided to sit on the bonnet and stare at us until \u2013 well, my guess is, until they got bored, we ran them over, or we were rescued by a police helicopter.</p> <p>We took the \"ignore them and they'll go away\" approach, which is what happened eventually and which did absolutely nothing for the balance of social relations in that neighbourhood. I remembered this incident while reading the new Royal Society of Arts report recommending that members of the public should be <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/about-us/rsa-pamphlets/the-woolwich-model\" title=\"\">trained to combat anti-social behaviour</a>. I wondered how such training might have helped us that evening \u2013 whether we could have all become friends after a brief explanation of our need to get to B&amp;Q while the sale was still on, or whether we'd have mounted a campaign to make sure the youth club stayed open for longer.</p> <p>Ben Rogers, the RSA report's author, comments that \"building people's own capacity to manage anti-social behaviour might be a more fruitful and realistic way forward\" than demanding more of the police at a time of budget cuts. \"The police can't be everywhere,\" he adds. \"And there are limits to what the police can do to address everyday conflicts and challenges.\"</p> <p>He has a point: the police are in the same boat as teachers in that they are asked not only to paper over, but to fix, tears in the social fabric that they, in isolation, did not cause. Now the same is being asked of the general public. Training in civilian anti-social behaviour management has been offered to, among others, social housing tenants, making people who live in poorly designed and socially segregated neighbourhoods responsible for maintaining social order.</p> <p>I've just spent two years living in a very affluent part of London, having spent most of the previous 15 years living in a particularly poor area, and the 18 years before that on an out-of-city council estate. Moving to what I called \"poshville\" made me realise the true nature of privilege: it allows you to live an entirely stress-free existence, should you choose to do so. It felt like walking on air. There was very little chance of getting marauded on the way to B&amp;Q. I didn't have to worry about being verbally abused outside the corner shop or getting eyeballed from the back seat of the bus. I didn't have to hunch my shoulders and look down every time I left the house. Everyone who lived in that area moved freely and confidently.</p> <p>Most people, at most times, care about their neighbourhoods and, indeed, their neighbours. Most people don't walk on by when faced with low-level anti-social behaviour. I've intervened more than once when I've seen boys trying to set fire to bus seats or kids smoking on a tube train. I regularly see others do the same. However, there's not a great deal you can do in a single encounter to persuade someone who has decided not to give a toss that it's worth thinking of others.</p> <p>Giving recalcitrant youths a verbal clip around the ear is not a substitute for making sure that they don't become recalcitrant in the first place. The state-level equivalent of walking on by is hounding individuals for their poor choices without improving their social conditions. The French sociologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo%C3%AFc_Wacquant\" title=\"\">Loic Wacquant </a>describes this phenomenon as \"punishing the poor\" \u2013the act of criminalising people at the bottom for making bad choices from a severely limited pool of options.</p> <p>Having lived for a long time in a poor area and then, for a much shorter time, in a rich one, it strikes me that the main difference is the overwhelming sense of control and \"rightness\" the rich area had. Anti-social behaviour was much rarer for the simple reason that people generally had better things to do and had no wish or reason to debase themselves in public. (Who knows what went on in private, but that's another matter.)</p> <p>The point is that we cannot do the work of the state without the back-up of internal as well as external resources. A fragmented neighbourhood of stressed and transient people is not going to be able to police itself as well as a settled area of contented and confident people. We have cause to demand a better state.</p> <p>While autonomy is crucial, the idea that individuals can attain complete control over social circumstances is as ridiculous as it is dangerous. We are generally happy to hand over management of aspects of our lives to others on the basis of implicit trust: we don't expect to be able perform our own heart operations or mend our own sewers. If you're going to have a police force at all, then the state needs to fund it properly. The less back-up we have, the more likely we are to walk on by.</p>",
  "<p>Screenwriter Peter Morgan and director Fernando Meirelles have proven themselves mighty talents in the past, but they've come a catastrophic cropper with this bizarre film, an all-star multinational US-Europudding, lurching along in a wince-making series of tonal misjudgments and false notes. 360 is a portmanteau film, a daisy chain of interrelated lives; the title promises a panoptic view. It's perhaps inspired by the multi-stranded movies of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rittu, and the cyclical structure is taken loosely from Arthur Schnitzler's stage-play Le Ronde but with a hopelessly shallow pseudo-sophistication that made me think it had in fact been written and directed by Alan Partridge. Anthony Hopkins is a troubled soul in Colorado, searching for the truth about his vanished daughter; Jude Law is a businessman in Berlin, whose marriage is stagnant; Rachel Weisz is his unhappy wife in London; Jamel Debbouze is a romantic dentist in Paris \u2013 there are many more. The film is so wildly unconvincing at all levels that it is simply weird: two different attractive, sensitive young women suddenly make massively unlikely overtures to scary, strange men they have never met. Huh? If someone suggests seeing this, do a 180 \u2013 and&#xa0;run.</p>",
  "<p>The US government's health watchdog is warning children and the elderly to avoid contact with pigs at agricultural fairs following a surge in humans infected with swine flu over the past month.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the bulk of the 145 infections identified since 12 July are in young people. Elderly people are also vulnerable to the virus passed from pigs to humans.</p> <p>The outbreak is centred on Indiana and Ohio but infections have also been reported in Illinois and Hawaii.</p> <p>Dr Joseph Bresee, of the CDC's influenza division, said: \"Right now a large number of agricultural fairs are ongoing around the country and the direct exposure of people to pigs has been the primary cause of infection.\"</p> <p>Bresee said that anyone coming into contact with swine should avoid eating, drinking or putting anything in their mouths while around pigs. He said that children and the elderly or anyone with a weakened immune system should not go near pigs at all.</p> <p>The outbreak of the virus, a strain called H3N2, was first detected last year but the number of cases has risen sharply over the past month. The biggest increase has been in Indiana where infections are up eight-fold in a week to 113.</p> <p>The Indiana state health commissioner, Gregory Larkin, was at a loss to explain the surge in infections.</p> <p>\"It could be we're where the strain broke out, or it could be that our surveillance is tighter than other states,\" <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/article/20120809/LIFE02/208090340/Swine-flu-cases-surge-Indiana?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CIndyStar.com\">he told the the Indianapolis Star</a>.</p> <p>Ohio has had 30 new cases, all traced to contact with pigs at agricultural shows. Dr Ted Wymyslo, director of Ohio's health department, said that has prompted closer scrutiny of people and animals.</p> <p>\"There has been a tremendous increase in surveillance across the state,\" said</p> <p>The outbreak has caused concern in rural states in the midst of summer fairs. Four Ohio counties have agricultural shows on at present and another 25 are to be held later this month.</p> <p>Even states without any swine flu cases are being forced to take precautions.<br>The Iowa authorities required exhibitors to have about 3,500 pigs screened by veterinarians for entry to the state fair that opened on Thursday.</p> <p>\"We're on alert and we're looking for it, but I wouldn't say we're concerned,\" the state fair manager, Gary Slater, <a href=\"http://thegazette.com/2012/08/06/iowa-state-fair-officials-taking-health-precautions/\">told the Gazette</a>. Bresee said those precautions are sufficient, at least for now.</p> <p>\"I don't think it's necessary at this point to cancel swine shows,\" he said.</p> <p>Bresee said most cases are mild and people generally fight off the infection but it is possible for the swine flu virus to kill. He said two people were kept in hospital since the recent outbreak and both recovered.</p> <p>Bresee also said that so far people appear to have contracted infections direct from pigs rather than other humans.</p> <p>\"At this point there's no evidence of sustained efficient human-to-human spread in the community,\" he said, although he said it is possible it will occur.<br>Typical symptoms are several days of fever, coughing, aches, sore throat nausea and diarrhoea.</p>",
  "<p>In the early nineties, a \"three strikes and you're out\" craze swept the nation. Twenty-six states have since enacted mandatory sentencing laws that were supposed to obliterate crime rates by sending repeat offenders, especially violent ones, to prison for as long as possible, or, in many cases, for the rest of their natural lives.</p> <p>Now, almost 20 years after the first \"three strikes\" law went on the books, it has become apparent that the laws have done little to lower crime rates \u2013 but a lot to ensure that prisons are packed to overflowing and that state budgets are bankrupt. As a result, in the past few years, the vast majority of states have been enacting repeal measures in favor of a more balanced approach to public safety. Even California, the mecca of three strike enthusiasts, has been taking steps (albeit baby ones) to undo the damage of their signature legislation. Which makes it all the more surprising, that just last week, the state of Massachusetts decided to buck the trend by signing its own three strikes bill into law.</p> <p>The Massachusetts law came to pass the way these kind of sweeping laws generally come to pass \u2013 in response to an egregious crime committed by a paroled felon. In this instance, the push for the legislation began back in 1999, following the rape and murder of 27-year-old Melissa Gosule. From 2000 to 2012, <a href=\"http://3strikeslaw.blogspot.com/\">\"Melissa's Bill\" was introduced in each legislative session</a>, but it was not until after the 2010 murder of police officer John Maguire, by another repeat felon, that the law gathered enough momentum to pass.</p> <p>The desire to enhance public safety and to prevent a reccurrence of such horrible crimes is completely understandable and praiseworthy, but to do so in a manner that has been proven time and again to do little to achieve either goal is, at best, foolhardy and, at worst, a cynical move by politicians wishing to appear tough on crime.</p> <p>The bill drastically expands the number of felonies that are eligible for life without parole sentences and will require that anyone convicted of a third violent felony will have to serve the full maximum sentence without possibility of parole. The bill also requires that the sentence for a third violent felony conviction will have to be served consecutive to any previous sentence, rather than concurrently. There are numerous other provisions in the bill, but they all amount to the same thing: a lot more prison time for a lot more people, in a state where the prisons are already operating at approximately 145% capacity. </p> <p>According to Tracy Velazquez, executive director of the Justice Policy Institute, which has <a href=\"http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/04-09_rep_threestrikesnatl_ac.pdf.pdf\">authored several reports on three strikes laws (pdf)</a>, the bill is almost certain to backfire:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"By creating a justice system based on offense rather than actual risk, you're going to end up sweeping more people into the system who don't need to be there. It looks to us like it's more of a public relations measure than a public safety measure.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Velazquez and others are right to be wary. In California, for instance, the idea that the three strikes law is really about enhancing public safety has become something of a joke (a very sick one), <a href=\"http://www.facts1.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=15\">as life sentences have been handed down</a> to so called \"dangerous criminals\" whose third offenses were no more egregious than stealing a set of golf clubs, robbing a video store, or (my personal favorite) the homeless man who stole food from a soup kitchen. Proponents of the Massachusetts bill claim that the same extremes will not befall them, as only <em>violent</em> felonies count as strikes, but as the definition of what constitutes a violent felony is so broad (home invasion and driving under the influence are on the list), and as judges are allowed no discretion to dismiss any prior strikes, there's reason aplenty to believe that many people will be subjected to the same unreasonable sentences as have been handed out in California and other states.</p> <p>It seems that Massachusett's Governor Deval Patrick had some reservations about the bill and asked the state supreme court to take a look at it. <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2012/07/27/mass_chief_justice_has_concerns_about_crime_bill/\">Chief Justice Roderick Ireland duly got back to him</a> and said, in essence, that the bill was more than a little flawed. His main concerns were the lack of judicial discretion and the bar on parole for so many offenders.</p> <p>A team of researchers at Harvard law school also examined the bill and <a href=\"http://charleshamiltonhouston.org/assets/documents/publications/CHHIRJ%203%20Strikes%20Report-Merged.pdf\">released a comprehensive report (pdf)</a> on its merits (or more accurately the lack of). They concluded that the bill would cost taxpayers an additional $125m a year; would impose unnecessarily harsh sentences on low-level offenders, overwhelming the already overcrowded prisons; would unfairly impact communities of color, particularly African Americans who are already overrepresented in the prison population; and would divert precious resources away from education and job creation, which are ultimately far more effective means of reducing crime. Said Benjamin Thompson, executive director of the Criminal Justice Policy Commission:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You would think that when you have the state supreme court and Harvard law [school] give you their opinion, and it both cases the opinion is that this is a bad law, it seems that would be enough for you to put the brakes on and have a rethink.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, Governor Patrick ignored the warnings and, apparently under pressure from members of the state legislature (many of whom are up for re-election shortly), signed the bill into law. If being seen as soft on crime doesn't sit well with voters, it remains to be seen whether being stupid on crime works any better.</p>",
  "<p>In a few short hours, behind the closed doors of courtroom number one in a nondescript provincial city, China attempted to dispatch its biggest political scandal for two decades.</p> <p>Thursday's official account of Gu Kailai's trial for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood raised as many questions as it answered. The number of the room where she is said to have poisoned the Briton was revealed: 1605, at the Lucky Holiday hotel in Chongqing, the southwestern city where Gu's husband Bo Xilai was the powerful party secretary.</p> <p>But details of Heywood's dealings and economic conflict with Gu remained vague.</p> <p>And when the black-robed judges return to the Hefei intermediate people's court, at an unspecified date in the near future, they are certain to pronounce Gu and her aide Zhang Xiaojun guilty. The defendants did not contest the allegation of premeditated murder, said Tang Yigan, vice president and spokesman of the court. There was ample evidence that they had \"used brutal means\" to kill Heywood.</p> <p>\"Gu Kailai is the main culprit and Zhang is the accessory,\" he said in a statement to reporters.</p> <p>Yet it went on to note the defence lawyer's claims that the 41-year-old victim, who left a widow and two young children \u2013 one, the godchild of his alleged killer \u2013 bore \"a certain responsibility\" for the reason of his murder.</p> <p>That was presumably a reference to the prosecution claim that Gu thought he posed a threat to her son, Bo Guagua, for reasons not specified.</p> <p>The case's sensitivity is such that it was not even mentioned in the country's main evening news bulletin. But a short report on the news channel showed Gu, 53, wearing a black suit and white shirt as she arrived in the courtroom.</p> <p>The former lawyer, who was flanked by two policewomen as she entered, looked considerably heavier than in pictures taken in recent years.</p> <p>Zhang, her 33-year-old aide, wore a white polo shirt and dark trousers as he walked between two male officers.</p> <p>Prosecutors alleged that Gu arranged for Zhang to escort Heywood from Beijing to south-western Chongqing on 13 November last year.</p> <p>She met him in his hotel room, where they drank tea and alcohol together until he was so drunk he vomited and needed water.</p> <p>She then poured the poison \u2013 that she had previously prepared, and that Zhang had carried \u2013 into Heywood's mouth.</p> <p>Gu's lawyer said her ability to control her behaviour was \"weaker than normal people's\" at the time of the murder, perhaps hinting at mental health issues \u2013 though the court noted that she was in good physical condition and emotionally stable during the hearing.</p> <p>More intriguingly, he said that her \"significant contribution\" in reporting on other people's crimes should be taken into account. No further details were given.</p> <p>Whether that was a hint that she might have discussed her husband's affairs \u2013 and that he could yet face a criminal trial \u2013 is impossible to judge.</p> <p>\"The most important part of the case is still not known \u2013 how it relates to Bo Xilai, a Politburo member and rising political star,\" said Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the Brookings Institution in the US.</p> <p>Bo was once tipped for possible promotion in the 10-yearly change of leadership approaching this autumn. Now he remains under internal party investigation. Unseen since his ousting in spring, his fate unclear. The challenge for the party is to justify the removal of a popular figure, without discrediting other leaders by association.</p> <p>\"The most important thing [to the party] is making the case that this is truly exceptional. As a murder that's probably true. But the economic issues involved are by no means exceptional; there's widespread corruption,\" Li said.</p> <p>Many believe such considerations explain why Gu stood trial solely for murder and why the trial was sited well away from the capital and from Chongqing, where Bo remains popular.</p> <p>Four police officers from Chongqing were charged last week with covering up Heywood's murder and will stand trial in the same court in Hefei on Friday.</p> <p>No foreign media were allowed into Gu and Zhang's trial, with officials saying there was no room in the spacious courtroom, although empty seats could be seen in the news footage.</p> <p>Two British diplomats attended in a consular capacity. Relatives and friends of Heywood and the defendants were present, the statement added.</p> <p>Dozens of plain clothed officers and scores of uniformed police surrounded the taped-off courthouse throughout the hearing. There were the usual muscular young men with crew cuts and T-shirts. But others, including a woman with a Louis Vuitton handbag and patent leather peep-toe sandals, also wore earpieces as they stood outside the granite-and-glass building in the drenching rain. Two protesters were later dragged away by colleagues at the back of the building.</p> <p>\"The security of the Hefei intermediate court is definitely number one in the world but whether it can ensure just proceedings is another question,\" lawyer Li Fangping wrote on Sina's Weibo microblog.</p> <p>Hefei, capital of Anhui province, is known as the home of Lord Bao, an 11th-century official still seen as an icon of justice and righteous officials in China.</p> <p>But responding to another lawyer's post, the artist and activist Ai Weiwei wrote on Twitter: \"The 'justice' of no justice, no fairness, and no openness to the public. It is sad.\"</p> <p>Relatives of Gu and Zhang hired lawyers to represent them, only to be told that the defendants had accepted state-appointed lawyers.</p> <p>Gu thanked the judge, prosecution and defence at the end of proceedings and asked that Zhang receive a lighter sentence than hers, a source who witnessed the trial told the Washington Post.</p> <p>Possible sentences range from 10 years in prison to the death penalty.</p> <p>\"I committed a crime that brought negative consequences to the party and the country,\" Gu added, according to the source.</p> <p>It is unclear whether she extended her concern to the former friend whose violent death, hundreds of miles from his family, had brought her to the courtroom.</p>",
  "<p>George Monbiot (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation\" title=\"\">Putting a price on the rivers and rain diminishes us all</a>, 7 August) is right to say the logic behind valuing ecosystem services is coherent and plausible. If they have no monetary value, their assumed value is zero. If their value is zero, then destroying them is harmless, despoiling them no loss, poisoning them no problem. For half a century, the green movement has urged greater awareness, more conservation, reducing our footprint on nature. Yet despite some limited successes, this approach has failed overall. Our demands on the natural environment are rising, not falling.</p> <p>Valuing natural capital requires us to train accountants to value every tiny, implausible detail of the biosphere around us. Will it work? Who knows? But so far nothing else has. We pay museums and galleries to act as stewards of our heritage assets. Who do we pay to look after our natural assets? If the answer is \"nobody\", what result would we expect?</p> <p>Valuing assets is one thing, but trading them is another. Monbiot's concerns about the prospect of a \"market\" in ecosystem services are well-founded. There is little doubt that if this government could find a way of doing it, it would but as Monbiot points out, it is almost impossible to do. Despite the risk of some bizarre kind of market emerging, valuing natural capital is still the right thing to do.<br><strong>Alastair McCapra</strong><br><em>Chief executive, </em><a href=\"http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Landscape Institute</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Monbiot does well to compare the monetisation of ecosystem services to the enclosures of common land. What price the biosphere? Before we rush to financialise ecosystem services, or to counter this tendency with cries of horror about corporate greed, why not acknowledge that we don't yet know how ecosystem services \u2013 or biodiversity \u2013 actually work? Ecosystems have functional values in dimensions that science can measure. Surely the first thing to do is to demonstrate the dependence of all terrestrial life on ecosystems in a practical, measurable way that everyone&#xa0;can understand. It should then be obvious that humanity has a special responsibility in respect of the biosphere which cannot possibly be discharged by selling chunks of it to anyone.<br><strong>Michael Dunwell</strong><br><em>Staunton, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is making a big mistake in arguing for a market-free world. Demand for access to fragile areas for tourism and extraction of resources, combined with scarcity, creates a market whether he likes it or not. The issue is whether it is shaped in a rational way and how it is regulated. The creation of incentives to invest in the conservation of biodiversity creates the possibility of a win for communities (investment in eco-tourism and its community infrastructure), for nature (price denotes real value creating a disincentive to destroy), and for investors (income from bonds over time). Those following the mythical path, denying the reality of market mechanisms, create obstacles to sustainable conservation.<br><strong>Jeremy Ross</strong><br><em>Ashtead, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 When land is taken into private ownership, in effect duty-free land enclosure, the landowner levies a charge on all that that land produces. This means all who do not have free access to land but need to use it for whatever work they undertake have a portion of the fruits of their labour paid to someone who does not work. Monbiot reveals that the UK has a natural capital committee,&#xa0;an ecosystem markets task force which proposes to pay landowners, \"the providers of ecosystems\", for their services, either by the government or by \"users\". This would further increase&#xa0;the&#xa0;cost to society of almost everything,&#xa0;as most of our land is&#xa0;privately owned.</p> <p>As the value of the land is determined by the community, why not tax the landowners for the use of it \u2013 land value taxation. This would resolve many&#xa0;problems, particularly speculation by those holding land in disuse to&#xa0;increase its value. This would encourage them to either use the land more profitably, or make it available for others&#xa0;to do so.<br><strong>Mary Law</strong><br><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot flits from being a hard-headed pragmatic green \u2013 pro-nuclear power \u2013 to dreamy romantic all too readily. His opposition to \"pricing nature\" seems very principled, the principle being of course that one day capitalism is going to up sticks and walk away. I disagree with him wholeheartedly, since capitalism seems perfectly capable of withstanding even the shocks it creates for itself. This must partly be explained by its readiness to exploit human or natural resources at less than their actual value. The greatest challenge \"greening\" society faces is to make us pay the actual value of what it is we consume, and if that means pricing rivers, so be it.</p> <p>But long before that we will perhaps develop an effective system of paying for the embedded carbon in our goods, the exploitation of child labour, the true cost of our waste and even for the legacy of our current tenancy of this planet. The task is to \"commonise\" the commons, and make us all pay our fair share for our use of it. If we did that, such abominations as the Alberta tar sands, as much a part of \"nature\" as a pretty stream, would be less attractive to the money grubbers.<br><strong>Colin Challen</strong><br><em>Scarborough, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Anyone worried about George Monbiot's article on commodification of nature may like to read Antonio Tricario's piece about the global nature of financialisation or privatisation of common resources, in Red Pepper this month. And if you thought the free marketeers had learned a lesson from the financial crash of 2008, they are voracious in seeking new ways of making money. In other words they know the price of everything and value of nothing. It is sad that this began in Britain under Labour, but Nick Clegg perpetuated government policy when he addressed the Natural Capital summit in Rio in June advocating natural capital accounting. If you put a price tag on nature, you create a market.<br><strong>Dr Graham Ullathorne</strong><br><em>Chesterfield, Derbyshire</em></p>",

  "<p>When Nicola Adams first put on boxing gloves at her local gym as a tiny schoolgirl of 12, bouts between two women were banned by the British Boxing Board of Control. They were too unstable, went the reasoning, on account of their menstrual cycles, and besides no one wanted to see a pretty girl get hit.</p> <p>On Thursday, 17 years later but not a great deal taller, Adams finally gave her response in the ring, emphatically defeating the Chinese world champion flyweight Ren Cancan to become the first woman ever to claim an Olympic gold medal in boxing.</p> <p>She had only gone to the gym that day because her mother had an aerobics class and could not find any childcare.</p> <p>Britain may be getting accustomed to gorging on medals, but the country's 24th gold, courtesy of Adams, is more significant than most.</p> <p>When the IOC ruled in 2009 that women's boxing would be in the London Games, 11 years after the BBBC was obliged to lift its unequal ban, the former world champion Amir Khan said he was against the move, saying: \"When you get hit it can be very painful.\"</p> <p>On Thursday he was ringside, paying lavish tributes, with everyone else, to the skill and dexterity of the female fighters.</p> <p>Once London's festival of sport has come to its conclusion, there is little question women's boxing will be reckoned one of its great successes. It is not merely the ferociously supportive crowds the sport has drawn \u2013 even if the most vocal bellows have been reserved for Ireland's Katie Taylor, who took lightweight gold shortly after Adams's bout \u2013 but the respect the competitors have commanded, among boxing ingenues and experienced sports devotees alike.</p> <p>As recently as March this year, the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA) was threatening to force women boxers at the Games to compete while wearing skirts \"to help distinguish them from the men\".</p> <p>Immediately before Adams's bout, Ching-Kuo Wu, the AIBA president, said the Rio Games would almost certainly see the number of divisions at which women could compete at the Games double from three to six. London's women fighters, he said, were \"heroes in boxing history\".</p> <p>As Adams stood on the podium to claim her gold, four days into women's Olympic boxing history, the exclusion before now of women from the sport already seemed as ridiculous as the bar, until 1984, on their running the marathon. Did she think she had answered the sceptics, she was asked later?</p> <p>\"It's not me that's answered them, it's the crowds. They have been cheering as much for us as they have for the lads.\"</p> <p>If she could inspire young girls to think boxing was also open to them, she said, \"that's amazing\". She added: \"That's what I want to see. More girls getting into boxing and participating.\"</p> <p>The martial metaphors, already tiring 13 days into these Games, are inevitably over-exercised when it comes to women's boxing, but in Adams's case, talk of punching through glass ceilings and battling her way out of adversity seem particularly apt.</p> <p>After her first bout at 13, she did not compete again outside her Leeds gym for four years thanks to a lack of opponents. There were no women's clubs when she started, and when two teenage girls tried to compete in a bout in 1997, Lennox Lewis called it a freak show; the Daily Mail, inevitably, a \"bout of madness\".</p> <p>She was first introduced to the sport by her boxing-mad father, Samuel, watching the Rumble in the Jungle and other legendary bouts on VCR and becoming entranced by Ali.</p> <p>She didn't really stop to think that girls didn't box. \"I was so young I wasn't really into the politics,\" she said after her bout. \"All I saw was Mohammed Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard, and I just wanted to do what they did.\"</p> <p>She turned pro at 18, became the first woman boxer to represent England, and went on to win two world championship silver medals and become European champion in 2011.</p> <p>It was the more impressive given a catastrophic injury three years ago, when she fell down stairs while walking to the ring before a bout, and cracked her vertebra. She went ahead with the bout, and won, but was so badly injured she was confined to bed for three months and unable to fight for a year.</p> <p>\"When I had my injury it was really hard to think I was ever going to get up to boxing speed, to be able to go as quickly as I did before. But I have improved on how I did before, and come back stronger.\" How did she account for that? A shrug. \"I was always determined that I would succeed.\"</p> <p>Described by her mother, Dee, as gentle and a \"mummy's girl\", Adams is just 5ft 5in, and, to fight in the 51kg category, weighs less than eight stone. She is also an irrepressible smiler, beaming as she entered the arena to huge cheers from the crowd.</p> <p>At their most recent encounter, in the world championships in May, she was defeated by Ren, but her victoryon Thursday was emphatic, at one point knocking her to the floor, though her Chinese opponent was quickly back on her feet.</p> <p>The Brits, waving union flags, chanted her name, and in perhaps the greatest mark of respect, the Irish crowd, expectant for Taylor's bout immediately after hers, even lent her a chorus of \"Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole!\" in the second round. As the final bell sounded she was still throwing punches, a tiny ball of energy.</p> <p>Adams's hopes that more women will go into boxing will almost certainly be helped by her success at the Games \u2013 and the visibility of Britain's other competitors at these Olympics, Natasha Jonas and Savannah Marshall. British women received \u00a31m of funding in 2009 and Adams had a generous living allowance and the full support of the boxing set-up at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. Her success is likely to mean that funding is increased.</p> <p>She said: \"There's an option of going professional, but I'm happy with the amateur game. Rio is definitely an option for me. It would be nice to see their opening ceremony.\" Besides, she said with a smile, \"We haven't yet had a double Olympic champion in boxing for the females. There's definitely some motivation there.\"</p>",
  "<p>Google is to pay a record $22.5m (\u00a314.4m) fine to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US after it tracked users of Apple's iPhone, iPad and Mac computers by circumventing privacy protections on the Safari web browser for several months at the end of 2011 and into 2012.</p> <p>The fine is the largest paid by one company to the FTC, which imposed a 20-year privacy order on Google in March 2010 after concerns about the launch of its ill-fated Buzz social network.</p> <p>In the latest case, commissioners ruled 4-1 that Google had breached that order not to mislead consumers about its privacy practices. There was no admission of wrongdoing on the part of Google.</p> <p>Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the FTC, said in a <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/08/google.shtm\">statement</a>: \"The record setting penalty in this matter sends a clear message to all companies under an FTC privacy order.

The adverts appeared after being bought by vendors trying to sell pills to US users, who bought AdWords adverts alongside search results. The company escaped prosecution after settling.</p> <p>In a statement, Google said: \"We set the highest standards of privacy and security for our users.

  "<p>The Chinese, according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_word_for_%22crisis%22\" title=\"\">John F Kennedy</a>, use two brush strokes to write the word \"crisis\". The first stands for danger; the other for opportunity. Still smarting from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/10/house-of-lords-reform-halted\" title=\"\">House of Lords reform</a> debacle, Nick Clegg faces both in equal measure.</p> <p>The increasingly strained relationship with the Conservatives provides him with room for manoeuvre, perhaps more than he realises. For the first time, the Liberal Democrats can operate in the way they should always have done \u2013 as an independent party that has chosen to ally itself with another to run the country for a specific period. They need make no more claims than this. They need to keep their options open and to be seen to be doing so.</p> <p>Clegg trades on the fact that he is the first peacetime Liberal in a century to preside over government. That is no mean feat and, by the nature of coalition, requires compromise. The public appears to appreciate, better than the Westminster village, that give and take is a sign of a mature political system.</p> <p>His problem, however, has not been the fact of compromise, but its nature. Most of the cases that he can demonstrate are negative ones. The Lib Dems have played a vital role in making Tory legislation less extreme, less red meat. The health reforms could have been worse; Europe policy would have been more barking; welfare changes would have hurt the vulnerable even more.</p> <p>The same would have applied had a post-2010 Lib-Lab coalition been formed. Labour is showing every sign of tacking to the right on criminal justice and civil liberties, continuing a miserable tradition established under the Blair and Brown administrations. What galvanises the troops, however, is positive change. <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">The Protection of Freedoms Act</a>, which received royal assent in May, was a small but important step forward in limiting the authorities' use of individual data. This is in danger of being more than offset by the hideous \"snoopers' charter\" and plans to introduce secret courts for intelligence-related criminal cases, such as the use of torture.</p> <p>The pupils' premium and the raising of the income tax threshold are the most visible Lib Dem contributions so far. They need to be developed more in policy terms and trumpeted more as achievements. But these two parts are less significant than the bigger picture \u2013 a more coherent vision for social justice and social mobility. Clegg has dipped in and out of this agenda. He should stick with it.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have shown an internal discipline that the other parties would not have done had they been in a similar position. (Remember the Maastricht rebels; remember the Blair-Brown hatreds.) Their restraint is, in one respect, admirable. Taken too far, though, it can also suggest an unhealthy ability to cling on to baubles that accompany political power. Compromise is good as long as comfort does not dull the senses or quell the anger that is the lifeblood of radical politics.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have been far too bashful. Largely untainted by the bankers' scandals, they could and should be leading the way on radical reform. The proposals in the Vickers report were a step in the right direction, but they are far too mild and slow to take effect, reinforcing the legitimate view that all governments \u2013 Labour and Conservative \u2013 are subservient to the wealthy. This is an area that Clegg should have been crawling all over from the start. The brief flurry of collectivist-voluntary endeavour from the Olympics \u2013 coinciding with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/09/standard-chartered-iran-sanctions\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered </a>becoming the latest bank to face allegations of dodgy dealing \u2013 should be used to reinforce that message.</p> <p>Another area where he should be making more noise is the environment. The Tories' attempts to limit the growth of renewable energies should be resisted more noisily.</p> <p>Ultimately, it comes down to who needs whom most. It is conventional wisdom that the Lib Dems are clinging on because the collapse of the coalition would lead to electoral annihilation. With the shelving of boundary changes, their task becomes marginally less difficult. But who will blink first?</p> <p>Driven by a born-to-rule mentality, many Conservative MPs feel insulted by the fact that David Cameron failed to win the 2010 general election and that, as a result of their party's poor performance, they have had to work with others. Yet, unless their fortunes improve markedly (and with the economy flatlining, there is no prospect of that for the next year or two), they have nowhere else to go.</p> <p>They could take the ultimate risk and go to the polls before 2015, but they would run the risk of leaving office as quickly as they assumed it. They could try minority administration, but the stuttering and haggling would be even more frustrating. So they are stuck; and Clegg, ever so politely, should use every opportunity to remind Cameron of this unpalatable truth.</p> <p>The forthcoming party conference season marks the halfway point in the cycle of this coalition government. This period, which is also likely to include a cabinet reshuffle, is a moment for Clegg to change gear. He should treat both rival parties with equal distance and courtesy. He governs with the Tories but should start preparing for life after 2015 \u2013 with either of them.</p> <p>The less tribal among Ed Miliband's team are already thinking these thoughts, which is a considerable improvement on Labour's arrogance in 2010. Some, however, are talking about a deal only if Vince Cable is in charge. Labour strategists should be reminded they will not be in a position to choose another party's leader.</p> <p>The prospect of a rapprochement between Labour and Liberals is causing consternation among Tories, as Tim Montgomerie wrote this week on <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/08/public-blame-the-conservatives-for-breaking-coalition-agreement.html\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>: \"We have to win outright next time or we're likely to be out of power.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dems have taken the blows, over tuition fees and more. They have lost the opportunity to modernise our moribund constitution. They have kept stumm for the sake of stability, and been accused by the left of treachery and by the right of petulance. Clegg has two and a half years to put a strongly liberal stamp on government as it seeks a path out of the economic mire.</p> <p>That is a desperately tall order but, as the past two weeks have shown, success comes to those who show muscle and no little guile.</p>",

If last year's Oscar frontrunners (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142801/artist\" title=\"\">The Artist</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142805/hugo\" title=\"\">Hugo</a>, even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142864/help\" title=\"\">The Help</a>) rode a wave of warm nostalgia (\"borne back ceaselessly into the past\", as Fitzgerald would have it), many of the current early contenders seem cut from an altogether different cloth. They are stark, self-critical, thrumming with unease. This year has already thrown up a brace of surprisingly dystopian blockbusters in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a> (in which impoverished underlings fight for their lives on primetime TV) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (in which the villain foments a people's uprising in Gotham City). Now these themes of loss, ruin and class envy look set to roll right through the autumn season. In America they call it the fall.</p> <p>If you're looking for the emblematic documentary of 2012, for instance, check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJYzgJ4CwI\" title=\"\">The Queen of Versailles</a> (released on 7 September ), a twisted cousin to Gatsby in the way it charts the rise and fall of the super-rich. Lauren Greenfield's Sundance prize-winner spins the tale of David Siegel, a Florida time-share mogul who brazenly boasts about pulling the strings that helped George Bush win the 2000 presidential election. Siegel, alongside his trophy wife Jacqueline, dreams of building America's biggest house. He winds up shredded by the financial crash and shopping at K-Mart, his golden future already behind him. \"I guess you could call this a riches-to-rags story,\" he says and for once he's right.</p> <p>Alternatively, there's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/22/killing-them-softly-review\" title=\"\">Killing Them Softly</a> (21 September) \u2013 a sinewy Brad Pitt hit-man thriller, described by the Hollywood Reporter as \"a metaphor for the ills of American capitalism\". Andrew Dominick's film plays out against a backdrop of the 2008 presidential election, where the economy is in free-fall and pristine election billboards stand proud in vacant lots. \"America's not a country, it's just a business,\" snaps Pitt's character at one stage. But in this case the business is failing and everyone \u2013 even the criminal \u2013 is feeling the pinch. Speaking in Cannes, where the film had its premiere, Pitt referred to it as \"a story that says something about our time and who we are\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789322\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/9/1344524931035/Ben-Mendelsohn-in-Killing-008.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Mendelsohn in Killing Them Softly.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Mendelsohn in Killing Them Softly</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pitt's comment prompts obvious follow-up questions. Because if films such as Killing Them Softly and The Queen of Versailles are a portrait of America, then they are also a mirror \u2013 reflecting contemporary anxieties back at their audience. And by and large, the picture's not pretty.</p> <p>Over at New York magazine, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/declining-america-2012-7/\" title=\"\">US critic Frank Rich identifies</a> what he regards as mass hysteria in the land at large. \"If there's one battle cry that unites our divided populace, it's that the country has gone to hell and that almost any other modern era, with the possible exception of the Great Depression, is superior in civic grace, selfless patriotism, and can-do capitalistic spunk to our present nadir,\" he writes. \"For nearly four years now \u2013 since the crash of 08 and the accompanying ascent of Barack Obama \u2013 America has been in full-on decline panic.\"</p> <p>Central to this panic is the suspicion that the US is tanking and that its golden moment may have passed. Certainly this is a concern within the domestic film industry. North American box office shrunk by 4% in 2011, while Chinese attendance swelled by 40%, forcing the major studios to rely more and more on the overseas market. Outside the Hollywood bubble the issue is still more pressing. The economy continues to stutter, allowing China to creep inexorably to the front of the stage. Meanwhile public panic finds its voice in Republican accusations (particularly clamorous in this, another election year) that Obama is somehow a defeatist, unpatriotic commander- in-chief, gently presiding over his nation's decline. All of which adds to the abiding tremor of angst, woe and disquiet \u2013 a mood that Rich (subverting an old Reagan campaign slogan) refers to as \"mourning in America\".</p> <p>Many of the films scheduled for this autumn are still under wraps, so it remains to be seen how far the rot extends. It seems unlikely, for instance, that the likes of Frankenweenie, the final Twilight or the first <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125622/hobbit\" title=\"\">Hobbit</a> movie will contain damning critiques of modern American society \u2013 though obviously time will tell. In the meantime I have high hopes for Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, directed by Steven Spielberg and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146341/master\" title=\"\">The Master</a> (9 November), which plays at Venice next month. It's the tale of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a would-be demagogue reputedly based on L Ron Hubbard, who concocts a cult called \"the Cause\" and promises to liberate the faithful from the pains of the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789323\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/7/20/1342793252489/Philip-Seymour-Hoffman-in-009.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Master\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Master</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Judged on face value, The Master looks like a natural extension of director Paul Thomas Anderson's previous work. The Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122167/there.will.be.blood\" title=\"\">There Will Be Blood</a> concerned itself with a raw-boned, ascendant US, a nation building itself up on the twin pillars of oil and church. This one, by contrast, comes mired in sophistry and doubt. It suggests that a new religion can be run-up out of nothing - an ersatz belief-system cast out onto the continent. And yet Dodd is surely more about snake-oil than salvation. In the words of one non-believer: \"He's making all this up as he goes along.\"</p> <p>Slide south far enough and long enough and you eventually fetch up in the delta wetlands of Louisiana, a landscape still reeling from the aftermath of hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill. This is the backdrop for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145827/beasts-of-the-southern-wild\" title=\"\">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a> (19 October), possibly the most warmly received film on the 2012 festival circuit. Directed by Benh Zeitlin and produced by Court 13, a \"grassroots film-making army\" from New Orleans, this is a vibrant, unclassifiable mongrel of a movie \u2013 a post-apocalyptic fantasy that feels naggingly relevant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789324\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/2/3/1328271457181/Beasts-of-the-Southern-Wi-007.jpg\" alt=\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beasts of the Southern Wild</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beasts of the Southern Wild plays out in a fantastical bayou called \"the Bathtub\", where raggle-taggle outcasts forage through garbage and eat cat food from the tin. They are the scattered and shattered, adrift in a land that has been flooded, polluted and left to die. Naturally the prognosis is bleak. Early reviews have rushed to position Beasts as a film from the frontline, perched on the edge of 21st-century America and beckoning the rest of us forward.</p> <p>All of which sounds fair enough, although it arguably paints a partial picture \u2013 conveniently ignoring the often buoyant tone of Zeitlin's picture: the exuberance and festivities and the familial bonds that sustain its characters in times of trouble. These qualities are borne out by the director's own view of Beasts of the Southern Wild. For him, \"the film is about how to survive and combat the loss of a place, the loss of a culture and don't let those things crush you\". And amid all the gloom \u2013 the half-built mansions and made-up religions, the vacant lots and cat-food suppers \u2013 it's hard not to draw comfort from that. Even in the ruins, it seems, there is still a place for fun, fireworks and the hint of a happy ending.</p> <h2>Subtext alert!

  "<p>The girls in the front row at the Middle East in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are gazing up at Brian Fallon, singing every word back at him. They were queueing outside in the heat by lunchtime to get these spots, and nothing will budge them. They look to be in their mid-teens \u2013 they have the wristbands to signify to the bar staff that they should not be sold alcohol \u2013 and they are truly, madly, deeply in love. The pretty girl with the red vest and the brunette bob in the very centre is acting out the lyrics, using only her facial muscles. You can all but hear her thoughts: Oh, Brian! If you were mine your heart would be made whole!</p> <p>The object of her affections stands and sweats, tattoos down his arms and up his neck. He is shortish and slightly stocky, a scrubby ginger beard covering his prominent chin. But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-gaslight-anthem\" title=\"\">the Gaslight Anthem</a>'s looks are not what have attracted the front-row girls. They are here for the bruised romanticism of Fallon's lyrics, for the wounded lover they imagine him to be.</p> <p>And as the Gaslight Anthem, unusually for a straightahead rock band, get bigger and bigger and bigger \u2013 their fourth album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/19/gaslight-anthem-handwritten-review\" title=\"\">Handwritten</a>, entered the UK charts at No 2 and the US charts at No 3 \u2013 so Fallon finds the expectations and demands of their fans more and more difficult to meet. As guitarist Alex Rosamilia explains in the cool of their tourbus earlier that day: \"We come from that school where we don't believe we're different from you and it's insulting to me on some kind of weird level that musicians are put on a pedestal.\"</p> <p>\"You were born with that talent,\" Fallon expands. \"The best thing you could ever say to your credit is you refined it a little. Fans look up to us and that's creepy. It's kind of this huge thing of idolising and hero worship and \u2013 people say \u2013 religious experience. But they crucified Jesus! They shot John Lennon! I'm not looking for that kind of thing, I'm not into this.\" He laughs, to show he is not comparing himself to Jesus, and blows cigarette smoke out of the bus window.</p> <p>The we're-the-same-as-you attitude comes from Gaslight's roots in the New Jersey punk scene, among bands such as <a href=\"http://hotwatermusic.com/\" title=\"\">Hot Water Music</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chunksaah.com/shop/index.php?main_page=advanced_search_result&amp;search_in_description=1&amp;zenid=i0l6jmjnijlsflhkqslrma03g4&amp;keyword=bouncing+souls\" title=\"\">Bouncing Souls</a>. All four members, bar bassist Alex Levine \u2013 Fallon's brother-in-law, who was signed up because he was reliable and was taught to play his instrument by Fallon \u2013 had bounced around groups, and forming Gaslight in 2006 was more or less their last shot.</p> <p>From the start, though, Fallon had a goal. \"I had a five-year plan,\" he says, \"to get to 500-seat venues and tour by ourselves and fill a room everywhere we go. I figured we could make a living off that. As long as you buy nothing stupid, you'll be OK.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2Leo9HSaGQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2Leo9HSaGQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Talk to Fallon's bandmates, or to other musicians who know him, and almost the first thing that gets mentioned is how driven he is. \"Brian always had pretty grand expectations of what we could do,\" says Benny Horowitz, Gaslight's drummer and commercial conscience. \"I'm a realist and kind of a curmudgeon, and in retrospect I think it's been good in both ways: we didn't go too far, too fast, which I can give myself some credit for, and at the same time if I was running the band we wouldn't have gone as far as we have. I'm grateful Brian had that headspace. I would have let my punk rock and white-guilt scruples hold us back too much.\"</p> <p>Horowitz's punk rock scruples come from his teenage years, from playing in bands and putting on shows while he was meant to be in high school. \"I really fell in love with the local scene and when I became a promoter it was really cool. You'd get a great seven inch that you loved, and either someone from the band or someone from the label's phone number was on the insert. You'd call and be: 'I book this Elks' Lodge in New Jersey and I see you're touring. Can I offer you this much to come?' I was 15 years old. They were the days before contracts, when everything was: 'We'll come, just give us a fair percentage off the door.' If you made a lot of money, you gave the band as much as you could. If you didn't make any: 'Here's enough for gas, I made you guys food, I got you a place to stay, and that's the deal.\"</p> <p>His key tools were a notebook with a thousand or so phone numbers, a pager and a payphone dialler. \"They were old pocket organisers that you could fuck with and somehow they'd mock the sound of change dropping into a payphone. So you'd dial the number and hear: 'Please deposit $2.25.' Then you'd hold the speaker up to the earpiece and press the quarter button nine times and that was it. I sat at this Quick Chek by my house for hours and hours and hours booking shows.\"</p> <p>By contrast, music took Rosamilia not out of the house, but down to the basement, where he'd sit and experiment on the four-track recorder he had bought with savings from his first job. \"That was really all I did throughout high school. I just recorded music by myself. In the basement. Sad little kid. I remember being obsessed with the recording process: how did they get it to sound like that? And by how moving the microphone further away changed the way it sounded. None of it sounded any good. I remember reading the liner notes from <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/pretty-hate-machine-mw0000207551\" title=\"\">Pretty Hate Machine</a> [by Nine Inch Nails] and it said: 'All songs written, arranged and performed by Trent Reznor', and I'm like: If he can do that by himself, I can do it by myself. I can imagine my mom wondering what was going on, me screaming in the basement with headphones on.\"</p> <p>For Rosamilia, music was an escape from a wretched experience at a private high school, which he began the summer after his father left home. \"The guy who's supposed to teach you how to shave and tie your tie and all that \u2013 he left. And now I had to go to a school where I had to tie a tie every day and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I didn't mesh well with the other kids. I had one little table that everyone else in the school made fun of, and those were my friends for high school.\"</p> <p>\"We were the depression-era kids,\" is how Fallon puts it. \"Not depression like in the 30s \u2013 but when they discovered kids were depressed and they need to take Ritalin. We were the kids that were like: 'This sucks, man. Everything sucks. This isn't a party. I'm getting beat up in high school.' People see us as more jubilant, but if you really read what's on the page it's not very jubilant.\"</p> <p>Fallon's drive was apparent when he was a teenager. \"I did the coffee house thing \u2013 we have coffee houses where people play, or we used to \u2013 and when I was 14 I started there. Just played all the time. Every weekend I had a show, or every Thursday. Open-mic nights, the whole thing. I was playing and playing and playing because I knew I had something that I had to be refining. People always refer to us as nostalgic, but I'm not nostalgic for anything. I'm happy to be here. The writing is about youth because there was no youth \u2013 I didn't go out and get wasted and go to parties, because I was trying to learn songs and write them so I could go to the coffee house and play.\"</p> <p>People see the nostalgia in Fallon's lyrics, with their array of heartland America reference points, their embrace of a cultural iconography that stretches from the 50s to the 70s (their breakthrough album, from 2007, was called The '59 Sound). They draw it, too, from the chug of a band content to let guitar, bass and drums do the work, a band <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul0XCTeJx_o\" title=\"\">endorsed by Bruce Springsteen</a>, a band that <a href=\"http://stereogum.com/1046472/the-gaslight-anthem-you-got-lucky-tom-petty-cover/mp3s/\" title=\"\">covers Tom Petty</a>. To supporters, it all makes Gaslight a great American rock'n'roll group; to detractors it makes them the Emo Street Band, with <a href=\"http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/the_gaslight_anthem/even_cowgirls_get_the_blues.html\" title=\"\">words thrown together</a> from a Classic Rock Lyrics Fridge Magnet set. Fallon tries not to take either group too seriously. \"I have this expression that I love: it's not your band. If I wrote a book it would be called one of two things: They're Not Your Friends or It's Not Your Band.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:archdukelesferdinand:playlist:6JGCVA0nGgXSXll1Lx4pu0\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:archdukelesferdinand:playlist:6JGCVA0nGgXSXll1Lx4pu0\" width=\"460\" height=\"540\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This time around, Fallon's got a little less specific, a little less rooted in writing about everyman experiences. It wouldn't be true any more, he says, and nothing matters to him more than honesty \u2013 despite the way he throws up his hands in horror and pulls a face when I suggest what he sells is sincerity. \"I'm not really your everyman any more, and I started feeling like that was a bit of a sham,\" he says. \"I did live that, but I'm not that guy [any more]. I have to write about different things.\"</p> <p>The references to old records and singers and films, though, aren't just casual shout-outs. \"I realised that everyone has to know where we come from,\" Fallon says. \"They've got to know we're on this side, that our line is here, this is the line in the sand. We're not with you and we're not with you \u2013 we're with these people. I was really obsessed with defining where we came from and separating ourselves from everyone else. Rappers did that \u2013 A Tribe Called Quest did that, talking about Michael Jackson and a lot of other artists, and they were letting you know: This is where we stand. That was the only thing out of hip-hop music that I took and brought into our thing.\"</p> <p>The thing took a little while to get going. Their first gig was up the road from their hometown of New Brunswick, New Jersey, early in 2006, in a town called Somerville. \"It was at The Only Game in Town,\" Rosamilia remembers. \"A place where people go to play Warhammer and magic stuff.\"</p> <p>\"They sell comic books in the front,\" Fallon says. \"There were maybe 50 people there.\" And how many were friends? \"Thirty,\" Rosamilia reckons. \"A decent chunk.\"</p> <p>\"I remember somebody telling me that day: 'You guys are gonna be huge,'\" Fallon says. \"I was like: 'What are you talking about? Did you see that show?' It wasn't great, you know.\"</p> <p>But Horowitz, using his old contacts as a teenage hardcore punk promoter to set up Gaslight shows, was soon starting to hear the same things. For the first time, getting gigs wasn't like pulling teeth, or the result of calling in favours. \"This was: 'Dude, this is good.' They weren't just yanking me off this time and I saw an opportunity I had never seen before.\" For Horowitz, the moment when that opportunity finally and definitively knocked was in October 2007, at Fest, a punk and hardcore event in Gainesville, Florida. \"Up to that point we were starting to gain traction, but nothing big. Then we went to that place and it was a lot of people in the same place for once. We played a show there that was just nuts. We packed this bar in the middle of the afternoon, probably 200 or 300 people, and people knew the words.\"</p> <p>Tonight at the Middle East the crowd all know the words, from the teenage girls at the front, through the boys with tattoos bouncing on their feet in the middle, to the older guys at the back. Fallon is solicitous but firm, telling one crowdsurfer to stop, and that if he's unhappy he can have a refund. He points out to a beer-thrower that he is a non-drinker and is no happier about being drenched in alcohol than a vegetarian would be to have meat thrown over them. And he and the band do not let up for the duration of their set.</p> <p>After 90 minutes onstage, condensation dripping from the low roof, the Gaslight Anthem retreat up the back stairs and out into the hot, close night. They walk to their tour bus and board it, open cold drinks and wind down for a minute. Then Fallon pulls his pack of smokes from his pocket and pulls the bus door open to reveal those teenage girls from the front row. \"OK,\" he says to the rest of the band, who aren't leaving their seats. \"Time for me to sign some autographs.\"</p> <p><em>Handwritten is out now on Mercury.

So anyone that comes along with another idea, let alone anything as explicit as this piece in the opening ceremony, the first thing they have to do in the US media, which is pretty much controlled by the corporations, is to discredit it as fast and as hard as they possibly can. And any time you see anybody saying: \"Oh, the American people didn't like this, they resented it, etc\" ... they're lying.</p> <p>It's not for your benefit, it's for our benefit. So our population here learns, once again, that anything that's done for the people is wrong.</p> <p><strong>I don't know if you're familiar with the mayor of London, a character called Boris Johnson ...</strong></p> <p>Never heard of him.</p> <p><strong>He's a Conservative buffoon. He's so ridiculous that there's a point at which some people start to find him funny. Is there an element of that with the Sarah Palins of this world? Or are they too dangerous to ever find them funny? </strong></p> <p>They're too insanely dangerous. Look, what did Gore Vidal say recently? The interviewer asked him what he thought of the Republican party and he said it's not a party any more, it's a Hitler Youth mindset and they're out to destroy the country, and he was 110% right. So in case anybody thinks Michele Bachman or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country. </p> <p>This right now is the time of decision in this country. There's no other way to look at it. This is it. This is the most critical time in the history of the country, for chrissakes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ct3BFR6GwFY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ct3BFR6GwFY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Is Mitt Romney the least worst candidate to have emerged from the Republican ranks?</strong> <strong><a href=\"#2\">(2</a><a name=\"2back\">)</a></strong></p> <p>I don't agree with that. Romney is as bad as anyone can be. He's a dangerous man. He's a cruel man. He's a perfect creation for what the Republican party is all about. And that is to say, a rapacious capitalist. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/12/mitt-romney-bain-capital-live\" title=\"\">Anyone who ran Bain Capital is not your friend</a>. All they're going to do is rape and pillage the land. That's what he did at Bain Capital and that's what he's going to continue to do. Plus he can go around and in this guise of being a good buisnessman, which he's not .... and this face \u2013 with the big grin and everything \u2013 is jovial, but hollow. And it's outrageous if you analyse what he's saying, because he'll say one thing and do the opposite. And the media gives him a lot of attention. You know the story of the Olympics at Salt Lake City? Then he goes over to Great Britain and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney-london-olympic-games\" title=\"\">bad mouths the Olympics</a> over there ... But he's carrying an entourage of donors and he's putting on a dog and pony show for them. It takes a bit of study. People are so desperate over here now. They don't have the time to research and go back over the history of this guy. And everybody knows that. So what I'm trying to do with these little songs I write is say: let's look at this a different way. I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest a different point of view.</p> <p>It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought \u2013 assuming that people will listen. For instance, I like that idea that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/koch-brothers\" title=\"\">Koch brothers</a> made a deal with Satan down at the crossroads. And that's useful because everyone understands what crossroads are all about \u2013 some of these songs call up and quote other songs. You've heard some of this material before, some of these lyric ideas, little inserts.</p> <p><strong>It's a bit different to the protest songs of the 60s. Is that because you think those songs were never really effective or because the times have changed?</strong></p> <p>Well, I don't know how to write soldier music. They were soldiers' songs so people could go out and hit the frontline. We shall overcome and so forth. And you need those types of songs. Especially in the Occupy movement. I think they're going to want to have songs like that, it'll be helpful. But I don't know how to do that really. That's a different kind of musical brain up there. So what I look at is these bleak stories: they're narratives and they introduce you to a character and the character says something.</p> <p>Irish songs function that way. They tell a little story. Or old time country music did that. It's not as direct. It's a little different.</p> <p><strong>But do you still find something inspiring in the idea of Woody Guthrie with his guitar and the slogan on it saying: \"</strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbulO_FB2ZI\" title=\"\"><strong>This machine kills fascists</strong></a><strong>\"?</strong></p> <p>Sure. He was a great storyteller in music. He was perfect. He had a good visual sense, so those tunes ... you can see them, I always thought. He had a gift for making songs out of things. He went and saw [the 1940 film] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath_%28film%29\" title=\"\">The Grapes of Wrath</a>, I was told, and wrote <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKWGAGPy_kw\" title=\"\">Tom Joad</a> in one night, this whole epic song with umpteen verses. Because he'd seen it, he knew how to do it, I think.</p> <p>He lived through the depression and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Worst-Hard-Time-Survived/dp/0618773479\" title=\"\">dustbowl</a> and so he turned his mind there. It's always good to listen to his thing. Now we're listening to him again on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/07/woody-guthrie-centenary-protest-songs\" title=\"\">the 100th anniversary of his birth</a>.</p> <p><strong>Is that something which has been lost from songwriting? I'm reminded of something I think Bob Dylan said about the sinking of the Titanic: within months, there were dozens of songs telling the story from a different perspective. Nowadays, people don't expect that from music, they turn to TV.</strong></p> <p>I know. The whole idea of lifestyle has corrupted everything. So if you're going to be a musician you have to present yourself as some sort of demonstration of some sort of lifestyle that's useful to people who have to demonstrate lifestyles: to sell clothes, liquor, or something. Disney started this. So the vocabulary of the music has changed a lot from, let's say, 1970 onwards. It's more about the person and what they seem to be, rather than what they think or what they've experienced.</p> <p>Once the record companies grew to being corporations it was obvious that those corporate managers would say: \"Hey, let's stop talking about unions, let's stop talking about bank fraud. We'd rather talk about sales. What can we sell here?\" Then we put it up on TV and the advertisers get happy because it sells their product. You know it's useful that way.</p> <p>Now, beneath the corporate level and beneath the lifestyle element, you're going to start to see more folks on the ground doing this again: playing instruments for that reason, expressing something. They have to find this again, young people, right? They might even want to do it again. I'm starting to see this, I think.</p> <p><strong>Does social media have a role in this?</strong></p> <p>I don't trust social media \u2013 I think it's all a bunch of bullshit. I think it's a manoeuvre. It's Orwellian. This small screen is going to hypnotise you. You're going to do what it wants you to do. What does it want you to do? It wants you to text your friend. What are you saying to your friend? You're going to say: \"I'm on the corner!\" \u2013 and your friend says: \"I'm on the other corner!\" Is that what you're saying ... is that what you're thinking? Wait a minute.You don't even know what you think and what you feel if that's what you're doing all day and night.</p> <p>Besides, all this social media \u2013 they're hooked to transactions in some way and they're delivering this massive audience \u2013 to whom? So I don't like it and I don't trust it.</p> <p>They say: \"Oh, the Arab Spring!\" Well, the goddamn military took over Egypt anyway in the end. Who says they got a revolution? What revolution? The fucking military went in there like they always have done.</p> <p>To me, the point is you turn the screen off and listen to yourself and maybe you'll have an idea. Maybe it might be a good idea, something you can do to help out.</p> <p><strong>I hate to say it, but it's almost like California's gift to the world \u2013 both with music in the 70s and with people like Steve Jobs \u2013 they both appear to be about empowerment and choice but actually it's the opposite.</strong></p> <p>I agree.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that's true of the the generation that you were part of? They pretended to be this great thing but you look back \u2026 and what did they really change?</strong> <strong><a href=\"#3\">(3</a><a name=\"3back\">)</a></strong></p> <p>The idea of change is overrated. Change in what way? A big change was Lyndon Johnson passing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act\" title=\"\">the Voting Rights Act</a>. They didn't want to do it. The Democrats didn't want to do it and the Republicans damn sure didn't want to do it. Eisenhower didn't want to do it and Kennedy didn't want to do it \u2013 but they had to do it. That's a whole story in itself. But now you have new Jim Crow laws \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/12/florida-panel-stand-your-ground-law\" title=\"\">stand-your-ground law</a> is already responsible for about 80 shooting deaths of African Americans. That's bringing lynching back. That's bringing Jim Crow back. Can you imagine? Could this be true? Well, it is true, if you see it that way. I do. I keep trying to say it with these songs till I'm blue in the face. But it's a fact. That's what going on in this country right now. That's why Vidal called it a Hitler Youth mindset. This is real shocking stuff.</p> <p><strong>On the new album, the song Cold Cold Feeling pictures President Obama pacing the Oval Office on his own in the dark. Is he a good man trapped in an impossible situation?</strong></p> <p>Yes, 110%. He's set upon by dogs. He's prevented from doing anything because the Republicans ensured that no president and no Democrat president can ever do good again. That's what Bush was sent in there to do: destroy the presidency, and that's what I think he did. How do you come back from that? How do you make the presidency good again? They talk about bi-partisanship but that's an empty word, doesn't mean a thing. So what is Obama supposed to do? How can he operate? This healthcare thing is really quite something, if it lives. They're going to go after it and try to destroy it, that's the leading end of the Republican effort right now, that's going to sink the Titanic, you know?</p> <p>I mean, I think he's a good man. He's a smart man. He understands the constitution, therefore he must respect it. They don't. I believe that he does.</p> <p><strong>Was this record born of a sense of duty </strong><strong>\u2013 because someone needs to stand up and say something \u2013 </strong><strong>or therapy to work out your anger? </strong></p> <p>It's a bit of both. I want to say something because I think you should if you can. It's challenging, but it's fun. I like to write these songs. I mean, yeah, otherwise what are you going to do, pound your fist on the table? That's no good. Then they win big time because they got you cornered. Music is the way that I know. It's the thing I have.</p> <p><strong>Do you sometimes feel like you've had enough \u2013 isn't there the temptation to flee somewhere else, and do something like make another record with the Buena Vista crew?</strong> <strong><a href=\"#4\">(4</a><a name=\"4back\">)</a></strong></p> <p>First of all, the old-timers are gone, or they are in places where I can't find 'em, or wouldn't know where to look. It's 2012 right now, so who's left?</p> <p>The thing about music is you never know when the next impulse is coming from. So since we're surrounded with issues, in this very unstable time ... there's that sense of \"let's do this now... let's write something here\".</p> <p><strong>Do you listen to much new music?</strong> <strong>Any hip-hop?</strong></p> <p>No, I don't. It's better to listen to something I like. There's always something there that's helpful or interesting \u2013 that's how I get myself moving. Plus, I sit and play the instruments. That doesn't change so much. I get better at it, but it's the same music.</p> <p><strong>Is it important that people realise that music is something you can make \u2013 you don't just consume it?</strong></p> <p>That's right.</p> <p><strong>Do you worry that the world's cultures are disappearing?</strong></p> <p>Of course. Like with any species. You worry about birds, you worry about insects. you worry about plants \u2026 the Earth. Yes, what a struggle. Culture is fragile. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mali\" title=\"\">Look at Mali right now</a>. That's the death of music there. That's gone now ...</p> <p><strong>In the face of all this, what do you do? What do you take pleasure in apart from music?</strong></p> <p>I'm a big fan of trees. I like to go see where they grow. California is beautiful \u2013 apart from the freeways and the malls and the prisons. You can still go out into nature. I'm a big fan of light. I'm a big fan of the way the sun is in the air here.</p> <p>We have a very nice life here. Our little house where little Susie and me are ... and Joachim is great.

  "<p>Where you find a company's name can be telling. Samsung was once ubiquitous on rather battered airport trolleys. Now it is found on Chelsea shirts and plastered all over the Olympics.</p> <p>The English translation of Samsung \u2013 three stars \u2013 once inadvertently summed up the Korean company's microwaves and televisions, which were viewed as a cheap alternative to Sony. These days, Samsung is the world's biggest technology company by sales, selling more flatscreen TVs than anyone else and trouncing Apple in smartphones. And it is not just a question of quantity; increasingly gadget fiends are tossing away their iPhone 4S to drool over the new Samsung Galaxy S3.</p> <p>The rapid rise of South Korea's largest company has placed this secretive behemoth at a crossroads. When its phones are promoted in the Olympic opening ceremony there is bound to be growing scrutiny of the way it organises itself, and where it goes next.</p> <p>Samsung is famed in business circles as a \"fast follower\" \u2013 letting others innovate before flooding the market with excellently-made, rather imitative products. Now it is the market leader, there is no one left to follow. And fast following can cause trouble: Samsung is locked in a vicious patents dispute with Apple in courtrooms around the world.</p> <p>Samsung is South Korea's biggest <em>chaebol</em>, a traditional, family-run conglomerate with a dizzying array of almost 100 subsidiaries. Samsung Electronics is its flagship but Samsung also makes ships, weapons, sells insurance and even runs Everland, a Korean amusement park.</p> <p>The company's rise has mirrored that of South Korea, which was poorer than Ghana 50 years ago. Samsung began making noodles and selling dried seafood in 1938 before founder, Lee Byung-chull, moved into sugar, textiles and, in 1969, electronics. Lee Kun-hee, the 70-year-old son of Samsung's founder, has been its visionary, controversial \"emperor\", as Professor Sea Jin Chang, author of Sony vs Samsung, puts it, for 25 years. In the early 90s, Lee, an amateur wrestler, famously pronounced that Samsung was second-rate and employees should \"change everything except your wife and children\". He once made a bonfire of 150,000 of his own company's mobile phones and, two years ago, tweeted: \"It's a real crisis now ... Most of Samsung's flagship businesses and products will become obsolete within 10 years. We must begin anew.\"</p> <p>Driven by such crisis-laden rhetoric, \"the real strength of Samsung is its speed,\" says Chang. \"Korean people eat fast, talk fast and walk like crazy. It's the spirit of the Korean people and Samsung is the best example of their competitive nature.\" Samsung has always moved fast. Two months after it built its first black-and-white TV in 1970, it was exporting them to Panama. \"For Koreans, being number one, getting the gold medal is the thing,\" says Tony Michell, author of Samsung Electronics and the Struggle for Leadership of the Electronics Industry.</p> <p>\"Samsung is an also-ran in the global smartphone market,\" observed the Economist 18 months ago. Now, Samsung is the market leader, selling around 50m smartphones in the second quarter of 2012 to Apple's 26m. While there is one basic iPhone, Samsung offers smartphones at every conceivable price.</p> <p>\"They've got the entire market covered,\" says Jason Jenkins, editor of CNET UK. Samsung's latest high-end phone, the Galaxy S3, \"is the hottest phone on CNET by a long way\" judges Jenkins. \"What Samsung has proven over the last five years is that they are very conscious about what consumers want and very quick to manoeuvre to serve those consumers,\" says Stuart Miles, founder of gadget reviewers Pocket Lint.</p> <p>To describe Samsung as speedy, militaristic and secretive might appear a stereotypically western judgment but it is the view of Chang, a South Korean. He says Samsung's ability to get good products to market quickly is because it is a \"militaristic organisation, very disciplined, [with] top-down management\", shaped by the fact that Koreans undertake military service. Staff are loyal, highly disciplined and work long hours: it is unusual for staff in research and development, for instance, to take more than one Sunday off each month.</p> <p>South Korea has a \"love hate\" relationship with Samsung, according to Chang. \"We are proud of Samsung because they are very successful and we're grateful for that but at the same time there are internal problems.\" Even the country's right-wing party has taken up chaebol-bashing in the run-up to elections in South Korea. Some critics argue chaebols stifle innovation and strangle small suppliers. Others question issues of tax, accountability and succession. In 2008 a Seoul court found Lee guilty of financial irregularities including tax evasion. He was fined $109m (\u00a369.8m) and given a three-year suspended sentence. Resigning as chairman of Samsung, Lee returned in 2010 after he was pardoned by the South Korean government.</p> <p>The Lee family only own about 1% of the entire group's shares and yet control Samsung through a bewildering array of holding companies. Lee's family are squabbling in court over the succession question with Jay Y. Lee, the Harvard Business School-educated son of Lee Kun-hee, now the clear \u2013 albeit unproven \u2013 successor. \"There's a legitimacy question,\" says Chang. \"The same legitimacy question that you may have for Kim Jong-un in North Korea.\" Chang also points to the tax arrangements which appear to have allowed \"JY\" to acquire huge wealth while partly avoiding the country's stiff inheritance tax.</p> <p>Samsung is facing increased scrutiny over workers' rights and working conditions. Traditionally, no Samsung employees were members of South Korea's fairly assertive unions although by law Samsung has an employee-management council, and there is now a Samsung union. Meanwhile, China Labour Watch this week claimed it discovered evidence of child labour at HEG Electronics, a Chinese supplier to Samsung and other companies including LG. Samsung said it was dispatching inspectors again to investigate the allegations.</p> <p>Samsung is more innovative than popular perceptions hold. Around a quarter of its 220,000 employees work in research and development and It holds a huge number of patents, not so much for products such as phones but for processes \u2013 clever production techniques. Apple's lawyers, however, think Samsung's smartphone success has come by \"slavishly\" copying its iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>Horace Dediu, founder of analysts Asymco, worked as a competition analyst for Nokia during its heyday in the early 2000s. \"Samsung was always on our radar. They made no secret of their intention to become more powerful than Nokia,\" he says. According to Dediu, Samsung went from \"fast following\" Nokia to \"fast following\" Apple.</p> <p>This analysis is reinforced by a Samsung memo produced by Apple in a Californian courtroom this week. \"Influential figures outside the company come across the iPhone and they point out that 'Samsung is dozing off,'\" wrote JK Shin, head of Samsung's mobile communications shortly after the 2007 launch of the iPhone. \"When our UX is compared to the unexpected competitor Apple's iPhone, the difference is truly that of heaven and Earth. It's a crisis of design.\"</p> <p>Consumers may not care about such skirmishes but the case could actually damage Apple, thinks Michell, because many people \"were never really aware that Samsung was even in the same league. All the court cases are actually saying, 'well, they are very similar'\". They certainly look it these days but so do cars and televisions. As Jenkins puts it: \"Personally I don't feel that companies can copyright a touch-screen rectangle.\"</p> <p>What is more intriguing is the interdependence of these patent pugilists. Samsung also makes components \u2014 semiconductor devices such as LEDs, microchips, computer memory and flash memory for phones and tablets. In fact, Samsung is the sole manufacturer of crucial chips used in iPhones and iPads. Apple is Samsung's biggest customer and accounts for 8.8% of Samsung's revenue, according to analysis by Bloomberg. If Apple stopped buying Samsung parts, Samsung's profits would dive. Then again, Apple would struggle to find a supplier as reliable as Samsung.</p> <p>Another damning court revelation was when British judge Colin Birss ruled that Samsung could not have copied Apple because it was \"not as cool\".</p> <p>Samsung has attracted many fans among Apple-haters (some geeks are fascinatingly tribal about brands) but the consensus is still that Samsung is not as cool as Apple. \"It can't be because they make so many things,\" says Jenkins. He is mystified by Samsung's desire to dominate every unfashionable electronics sector. \"Why are Samsung killing themselves to flog hard drives or MP3 players? Why not just admit Apple won that battle years ago?\"</p> <p>Samsung has strived to become cooler by spending heavily to be a \"top\" Olympic sponsor alongside legendary brands such as Coca-Cola and McDonalds.</p> <p>\"Most of us had never heard of Samsung before their Olympics sponsorship, but now we can't imagine a world without them,\" says John Davis, author of The Olympic Games Effect. Samsung became a top sponsor in 1997 and its brand value increased from US$3.1bn two years later to $23.4bn in 2011, according to Interbrand. Its presence at London 2012 \u2013 also opening a flagship, Apple-style store in Westfield Stratford \u2013 shows its desire not merely to be known, but to be desired. Davis judges Samsung will emerge a clear winner from the Games \"if you define winner as having visible and memorable advertising and products that generate 'buzz'\".</p> <p>Samsung dominates smartphones but for how long? The marketplace is littered struggling former giants such as Nokia and BlackBerry's RIM. \"It won't be Apple or the litigation that brings Samsung down,\" says Dediu. \"It will be some unknown Chinese OEM [original equipment manufacturer]. That's going to be the story of the next few years.\"</p> <p>Samsung's basic phones will be trumped by cheap Chinese brands; at the top end, Samsung depends on Google for the Android operating system so beloved of phone geeks. \"If Google doesn't match Apple, Samsung will get caught in a trap,\" says Dediu. Samsung might also flounder if Google makes a superior version of Android for its own handset company, Motorola.</p> <p>Dediu predicts a near future where all hardware is \"good enough\" and big profits will only be made from software and services \u2014 music services, cloud hosting, voice recognition, apps. Jenkins agrees. \"Whoever controls the gateway to these services will own the next decade,\" he says.</p> <p>Samsung may excel at making phones but Dediu is not impressed by its approach to software. \"There is no buzz, not even rumour of Samsung having a presence in any software services area. Normally you'd see some acquisitions or an office built in the Valley,\" he says. Stuart Miles of Pocket Lint sees the S3 as evidence Samsung are trying to understand how software works but Jenkins is not hugely impressed. Samsung's services \"have stupid names and don't work very well,\" he says.</p> <p>Samsung is looking beyond the world of phones, however. Traditionally, Korean chaebols have been reluctant to move into new areas by purchasing smaller companies \"but somewhere in the DNA of Samsung there is a more acquisitive mentality,\" says Michell. Samsung is investing $21bn up to 2020 in five areas \u2013 solar panels, LEDs for lighting, electric car batteries, medical equipment and biotech drugs \u2013 in what appears an astute repositioning in an era of ageing populations and renewable energy challenges. Its initial success is mixed, according to Michell, with only medical technology an unqualified success. Like others in Seoul, however, he believes the threat from China is overstated. \"The Chinese have a long learning curve in product quality and the ability to produce a million items without defects,\" he says.</p> <p>Samsung may be emblazoned over our products and sports for some years yet.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's role in supplying information to an American military \"kill list\" in Afghanistan is being subjected to legal challenge amid growing international concern over targeted strikes against suspected insurgents and drug traffickers.</p> <p>An Afghan man who lost five relatives in a missile strike started proceedings against the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and the Ministry of Defence demanding to know details of the UK's participation \"in the compilation, review and execution of the list and what form it takes\".</p> <p>Legal letters sent to Soca and the MoD state the involvement of UK officials in these decisions \"may give rise to criminal offences and thus be unlawful\". They say Britain's contribution raises several concerns, particularly in cases where international humanitarian laws protecting civilians and non-combatants may have been broken.</p> <p>\"We need to know whether the rule of law is being followed and that safeguards are in place to prevent what could be clear breaches of international law,\" said Rosa Curling from the solicitors Leigh Day &amp; Co. \"We have a family here that is desperate to know what happened, and to ensure this kind of thing never happens again.\"</p> <p>Targeting Taliban commanders in precision attacks has been an important part of Nato's strategy in Afghanistan, and it has involved US, British and Afghan special forces, and the use of drones.</p> <p>But who is put on the \"kill list\" and why remains a closely guarded secret \u2013 and has become a huge concern for human rights groups. They have questioned the legality of such operations and said civilians are often killed.</p> <p>Soca refused to discuss its intelligence work, but the agency and the MoD said they worked \"strictly within the bounds of international law\". Its role in the operation to compile a \"kill list\" was first explained in a report to the US Senate's committee on foreign relations.</p> <p>The report described how a new task force targeting drug traffickers, insurgents and corrupt officials was being set up at Kandahar air field in southern Afghanistan. \"The unit will link the US and British military with the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency], Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, and police and intelligence agencies from other countries.\" The 31-page report from 2009 acknowledged the precise rules of engagement were classified.</p> <p>But it said two generals in Afghanistan had explained they \"have been interpreted to allow them to put drug traffickers with proven links to insurgency on a kill list, called the joint integrated prioritised target list\".</p> <p>\"The military places no restrictions on the use of force with these selected targets, which means they can be killed or captured on the battlefield,\" the Senate report said. \"It does not, however, authorise targeted assassinations away from the battlefield. The generals said standards for getting on the list require two verifiable human sources and substantial additional evidence.\"</p> <p>The legal challenge has been brought by an Afghan who believes his relatives were unlawfully killed in a case of mistaken identity during one \"kill list\" operation. A bank worker in Kabul, Habib Rahman lost two brothers, two uncles and his father-in-law in a US missile attack on their cars on 2 September 2010. They had been helping another member of the family who had been campaigning in Takhar province in northern Afghanistan in the runup to the country's parliamentary elections. In total, 10 Afghans were killed and several others injured.</p> <p>Rahman says most of those who died were election workers. But the attack was praised by Nato's International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf) which said the target had been a man in the convoy called Muhammad Amin. The US accused him of being a Taliban commander and member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and said the people who had been travelling with him had been insurgents.</p> <p>A detailed study of the incident by the research group <a href=\"http://aan-afghanistan.com/\" title=\"\">Afghanistan Analysts Network</a> contradicted the official account, saying Isaf had killed Zabet Amanullah. Amin was tracked down after the incident and is still alive, said the study's author, Kate Clark. \"Even now, there does not seem to be any acknowledgment within the military that they may have got the wrong man,\" she said. \"It is really very bizarre. They think Amin and Amanullah are one and the same.\"</p> <p>Rahman's lawyers acknowledge they do not know whether information provided by Britain contributed to this attack, but hope the legal challenge will force officials to be more open about the British contribution to the \"kill list\".</p> <p>The letters to Soca's director general, Trevor Pearce, and the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, point to the Geneva conventions, which say that persons taking no active part in hostilities are protected from \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\".</p> <p>They also draw on the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has said anyone accompanying an organised group who is not directly involved in hostilities \"remains civilian assuming support functions\".</p> <p>The legal letters, the first step towards seeking judicial review, say \"drug traffickers who merely support the insurgency financially could not legitimately be included in the list\" under these principles. The lawyers believe that, even if Isaf had targeted the right man, it may have been unlawful for others to have been killed in the missile strike.</p> <p>\"The general practice of international forces in Afghanistan and the experience of our client suggest that proximity to a listed target is, on its own, sufficient for an individual to be considered a legitimate target for attack. Such a policy would be unlawful under the international humanitarian law principles,\" they say.</p> <p>Curling said: \"Ensuring the UK government and its agencies are operating within their legal obligations could not be more important. Our client's case suggests the establishment and maintenance of the 'killing list' is not in line with the UK's duties under international humanitarian law. Our client lost five of his relatives in an attack by the international military forces as a result of this list. It is important that the Ministry of Defence and Soca provide us with the reassurances sought.\"</p> <p>Soca said: \"Soca does not discuss intelligence. Soca works strictly within the bounds of international law.</p> <p>\"Our activity overseas is conducted in line with other UK government departments, which comply with the principles of international humanitarian law and human rights.\"</p> <p>The MoD said: \"As part of Isaf, UK forces operate alongside numerous partner nations in the fight against an insurgency that seeks to maim and kill both innocent Afghan civilians and allied forces alike. We continue to work towards a stable Afghanistan that can effectively manage its own security by the time our combat operations cease at the end of 2014.</p> <p>\"In doing so, UK forces operate strictly within the bounds of international law under rules of engagement which, for reasons of operational security, we do not discuss in detail.\"</p>",
  "<p>Olympic fashion fever gets to us all eventually, doesn't it David Cameron?</p> <p>Check out the PM in an Adidas red collar polo shirt in all its Team GB nodding glory. This sports get up, apparently for boxing watching, is not much of a shock when you consider the numerous pictures we've seen of him out jogging. But there is an obvious issue. And no, its not his choice of armchair, which is more World of Interiors than two-rounds-in-the-ring.</p> <p>It's the styling of a sports polo shirt with office trousers and shoes. Ghastly. Yes, yes, he's working and he's come straight from desk to TV, whipped off his shirt and tie to chill in his casual garb. But really this is a polo shirt that needs to be donned with something a little more casual. Chinos would have been better even if a little on the Henley Regatta side. Mind you, we should all be relieved for two reasons. First, he's not got any lycra on and secondly, he's not rocking a pair of yellow Nikes.</p>",
  "<p>Finally, a genuinely positive spin for England in a thoroughly uncomfortable week, with polished performances from a pair of potential successors to Graeme Swann.</p> <p>James Tredwell, the dependable Kent off-spinner who has already played one Test and a handful of one-day internationals, exploited surely the driest strip of earth in Manchester to claim three for 93. But it was the impact made by Lancashire's exciting young left-armer Simon Kerrigan from the Pavilion End that really fired the imagination.</p> <p>Shortly after lunch, Kerrigan had failed to take a wicket in 13 overs and conceded 35 runs, including a couple of sixes from Michael Klinger, an experienced South Australia batsman who had a good stint with Worcestershire earlier this season. Little more than an hour later he returned to the changing rooms with figures of six for 59, the tourists having lost their last seven wickets for 63 in the space of 24 overs.</p> <p>In a first-class career of only 31 appearances which began here in April 2010, the 23-year-old from Preston has shown an exciting ability to take his wickets in match-winning clusters. He claimed five for 43 on debut against Warwickshire, five for seven (and match figures of seven for 26) on his first appearance last season on a raging turner at Edgbaston, and famously nine for 51 \u2013 the best figures by a Lancashire bowler for 58 years - to seal a dramatic victory against Hampshire at Aigburth in the penultimate match of the county's Championship triumph.</p> <p>This season has been trickier, as Kerrigan has usually operated as a lone spinner for the first time in his career, and has struggled without the control exerted by the more experienced Gary Keedy from the other end. But with Tredwell slotting into Keedy's role and keeping things tight, this was a spectacular return to form.</p> <p>\"He bowls at a nice pace which obviously makes it hard for the batsmen,\" said Tredwell, who had never even met his spin twin until the Lions gathered in Manchester at the start of the week. \"If there's a bit of turn, there's not much time to change your decision, which is obviously the key on a pitch like this. He can also bowl in a variety of ways, getting the ball up above the eyeline or bowling a sort of cutter, which is another big plus.\"</p> <p>Tredwell claimed the prize scalp of Ed Cowan, one of Australia's incumbent Test openers who is leading this A team to aid his preparations for next year's full Ashes tour, who had batted beautifully for 99 until he was undone by a classic off-break that lifted and left him. He also dismissed Klinger, one of two batsmen who were caught off bat and pad by Joe Root \u2013 a sharp short leg in addition to a highly promising opener, as he showed in combination with his Yorkshire colleague Jonny Bairstow in a partnership of 128 later in the day.</p> <p>Then a brilliant slip catch by Bairstow gave Kerrigan his first wicket, that of Tim Paine, a young wicketkeeper who was shaping as Brad Haddin's successor until he suffered a serious thumb injury last year. Peter Forrest, a batsman who has already played 15 ODIs, followed lbw, and Kerrigan then dismissed two Test regulars, Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon, with consecutive balls.</p> <p>Swann, who took a wicket for Nottinghamshire at Taunton on Thursday, will not be losing any sleep yet, even if Kerrigan's haul provides another opportunity for James Anderson to rib him about the young spinners aiming to take his place. But given the recent worrying signs of wear and tear in their premier slow bowler, this was a highly encouraging day for the beleaguered England management.</p>",
  "<p>Plans for the first police commissioner elections this autumn have been thrown into fresh disarray with the disclosure that magistrates \u2013 who make up a significant number of the candidates \u2013 have been banned from standing.</p> <p>It is thought that the guidance issued last Friday by the senior presiding judge in England and Wales could affect as many as six or seven \u2013 a fifth \u2013 of the official Tory candidates so far adopted and others who are standing as independents or for other parties</p> <p>One of the Conservatives' leading candidates openly attacked the judge's ruling on Thursday night. Craig Mackinlay, the frontrunner to become the police and crime commissioner in Kent, contacted the Guardian on Twitter and said: \"Massive row developing (about) PCCs and magistrates. I am 'caught'. Unacceptable and nonsensical. Post election can agree but not pre.\"</p> <p>His intervention came as those affected started to take the first steps to launch a possible legal challenge to Lord Justice Goldring's decision.</p> <p>Among the independents affected will be Ann Barnes, who has been chair of Kent police authority for the past six years.</p> <p>Goldring's guidance is also believed to ban the dozens of elected councillors who are also magistrates from serving on police and crime panels, which are being introduced to scrutinise the actions of elected police commissioners.</p> <p>The Local Government Association (LGA) called the decision \"nonsensical\" but the Judicial Communications Office defended Goldring, saying judicial office holders had to be seen to be independent.</p> <p>\"Holding political office with personal and direct accountability for the performance of the police is not compatible with the role of a magistrate,\" it said. \"To be both accountable for the performance of that force and sit as an independent judge trying cases brought by that force is incompatible.\"</p> <p>Judges are banned from standing as candidates by the legislation introducing the new elections, to be held on 15 November, but it does not mention magistrates. The guidance, designed to protect judicial independence, is also likely to have serious implications for the many MPs who are also magistrates. The ruling is surprising as magistrates have had a statutory role on police authorities for more than 30 years.</p> <p>The disclosure has taken the major political parties by surprise. At least one Conservative candidate to be a police and crime commissioner (PCC), Julie Iles, who has strong hopes of winning the November election in Surrey, immediately tweeted: \"Seems I've no choice but to resign with immediate effect as a JP but I am saddened by it.\"</p> <p>The disclosure follows hard on the heels of the disqualification of Labour's candidate in Avon and Somerset because of a \u00a35 fine 47 years ago for two minor offences at the age of 13, and adds to a growing sense of chaos around the new elections.</p> <p>Goldring says in his guidance: \"Although not disqualified on statute, I have decided that it is not permissible for magistrates to stand for election as PCCs. Magistrates who wish to stand for election, upon announcement of their intention to do so, should resign immediately. During the election campaign, former magistrates should be highly circumspect when describing their bench careers,\" he advises.</p> <p>\"Should magistrates wish to participate actively in a campaign for the election of a PCC they should take leave of absence to do so, and avoid behaviour which could risk bringing the judiciary into disrepute. Magistrates should also refrain from holding meetings with candidates standing for election.\"</p> <p>Goldring explained that while many people standing for election might not be party affiliated, the election itself and role upon appointment \"is likely to be highly political\". He added: \"Further, it would be inappropriate for a judicial office holder to hold an office which has an oversight and leadership role in respect of police forces, or to participate in an election campaign for such a role.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman confirmed that there was nothing in the legislation to prevent magistrates from standing. \"Whether you can or cannot be a magistrate is down to the judicial authorities,\" he added.</p> <p>But the LGA attacked the guidance. \"Parliament took the view that magistrates could stand for election as commissioners and we would question why the senior presiding judge has decided differently,\" said Councillor Mehboob Khan of the LGA's safer communities board.</p> <p>He said that the ban on magistrates serving on oversight panels, which were not elected, made particularly little sense. He added that until recently there had to be at least one magistrate by law on each police authority, the bodies being replaced by the elected commissioners.</p> <p>Sam Chapman, who runs the website <a href=\"http://topofthecops.com/\" title=\"\">Topofthecops.com</a>, which is tracking the elections and revealed the guidance, said the Wiltshire Conservative candidate, Angus Macpherson, and Paul Bullen, the Ukip candidate in Cambridgeshire, were both JPs.</p> <p>Chapman said the guidance was hard to justify on the grounds that the job would be highly political when politicians already served as lord chancellor, attorney general and solicitor general, and it ignored the fact that magistrates until recently made up a third of police authorities.</p> <p>\"Ironically, the form of judicial independence defended in this direction seems so extreme as to in itself constitute a political statement. This is not merely rules. This is message. And it's a message which needs to be reconsidered,\" said Chapman, who was shortlisted to be the Conservative PCC candidate in Lancashire.</p>",

  "<p>The Ministry of Justice is planning to set up call centres inside jails as part of its work programme for prisoners, according to documents promoting the scheme.</p> <p>Details of the plans have emerged after marketing material from an MoJ- supported company, which described the call centre scheme as a \"rehabilitation revolution\", were passed to the Guardian.</p> <p>The MoJ stressed that the company, UrbanData Ltd, was no longer involved in the programme as it had <a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/60232/notices/1646015/recent=10;category=corp-insolvency-winding-up-court;subcategory=petitions-companies\" title=\"\">filed for liquidation this month</a> but the department confirmed they are still interested in setting up call centres from inside the prison estate as part of their programme for expanding <a href=\"http://www.one3one.justice.gov.uk/home/\" title=\"\">ONE3ONE Solutions</a>, formerly known as the Prison Industries Unit.</p> <p>In a leaflet sent out to various organisations late last year, UrbanData said it could offer \"lower costs and overheads\" if businesses signed up.</p> <p>\"The opportunity for your organisation is a higher corporate responsibility profile by engaging in a high-profile initiative supported by the Ministry of Justice, lower costs and overheads for trained contract centre agents, flexible resources that can deal with overflow calls and specific projects, all dedicated to growing and supporting your business,\" the leaflet read.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/interactive/2012/aug/09/urbandata-prison-call-centres-leaflet\" title=\"\">Advertising the scheme as a \"fantastic rehabilitation revolution\"</a> the flyer added that prison-run call centres could offer trained operators \"with British Regional [sic] accents as an effective alternative to off shoring operations\".

  "<p>A planned protest march against US drone strikes in Pakistan, due to go through one the world's most dangerous hotbeds of Islamic militancy, has hit a major snag after the Pakistani Taliban announced they would try to kill the leader of the procession, the former cricket star turned politician Imran Khan.</p> <p>\"If he comes, our suicide bombers will target him,\" the Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan told the Associated Press during an interview in a remote compound in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), a mountainous and lawless region on the Afghan border.</p> <p>During the interview, which concluded with a volley of automatic gunfire from his bodyguards, Ahsan said Khan was fair game because he was a \"liberal\" and anyone who participated in forthcoming national elections would be considered \"infidels\" and attacked.</p> <p>His remarks have surprised many, including people in Khan's camp, because of Khan's unflagging opposition to missile strikes by remote-controlled drones against Taliban commanders, his repeated calls for ceasefires and negotiations with the Taliban and his own bitter attacks on Pakistan's elite class of \"liberals\".</p> <p>He has even been dubbed \"Taliban Khan\" by some critics because of the support his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has received from notorious conservative Islamists parties, some widely regarded as fronts for militant groups.</p> <p>On Thursday Khan promised to continue with the peace march in late September through Waziristan, an area that is home to a plethora of insurgent groups, including al-Qaida and the Taliban.</p> <p>On Twitter Khan told his followers that \"a man of faith doesn't fear death\" and that the planned \"march against drones that have destroyed millions of lives in FATA is worth dying for\".</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, he said he hoped his \"peace caravan\" would attract 100,000 people, most of them from FATA itself.</p> <p>\"Every man in the tribal areas is a warrior and carries a gun. We will be using them to protect us,\" he said.</p> <p>The march is also attracting international support, with activists from the US anti-war group Code Pink due to attend. The group is largely made up of women \u2013 including mothers whose sons have served in Afghanistan, some of whom are likely to attend the march.</p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, director of the rights group Reprieve, said some as yet unnamed British politicians were also due to attend as well as \"a lot of media\".</p> <p>\"I have no desire to get myself or anyone else injured or killed,\" he said. \"But we are going to North Waziristan, absolutely, we are going where the drones are.\"</p> <p>North Waziristan, once dubbed \"Terror Central\", does much to deserve its reputation as one of the most dangerous places in the world.</p> <p>It hosts a number of different militant groups and fighters from all over the world. The writ of the Pakistani army, let alone the state, barely runs outside the walls of a smattering of bases throughout the area.</p> <p>It is a key safe haven for the Haqqani network, a Taliban-affiliated group that has used it as a base to launch spectacular attacks, including on high-profile targets in Kabul such as the US embassy.</p> <p>With Pakistan reluctant to take the Haqqani network on militarily, the Obama administration has increasingly turned to unmanned drones to try to suppress the groups, a tactic the US claims is highly effective at killing carefully targeted militants.</p> <p>Rights groups, however, say large numbers of civilians are killed as well \u2013 a claim that is extremely hard to test as independent researchers and journalists cannot travel freely to areas targeted.</p> <p>\"We are trying to open Waziristan up,\" said Stafford Smith. \"There is really no other war zone in the world where no one gets to go.\"</p> <p>Stafford Smith said he was responsible for ensuring the safety of the marchers from overhead drones operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.</p> <p>\"My job is to make sure the CIA doesn't do anything stupid,\" he said. \"I will write to Obama and tell him that if my picture comes up on his weekly PowerPoint please, please don't call in the drones.\"</p> <p>It was revealed earlier this year that Barack Obama has a weekly briefing where he personally assesses which militants can be killed by drones.</p> <p>Both Stafford Smith and Khan suggested the reported remarks of the Taliban spokesman did not reflect the movement as a whole, with Stafford Smith saying such a position would be \"illogical\" and \"idiotic\".</p> <p>In an email to Pakistani media on Thursday Ahsan partially retracted his statement, saying a decision to attack Khan would not be finalised until a week before the march.</p> <p>Khan, who is an emerging force in Pakistani politics, said he suspected the remarks were somehow orchestrated by \"political people who are threatened by me\".</p> <p>He has long campaigned for dialogue with the militants, arguing that any military push into North Waziristan would be disastrous, causing \"massive collateral damage and blowback in the cities of Pakistan through suicide bombings\".</p> <p>\"The ideological element of militants that want sharia law and not elections is only a tiny minority, not even 3%,\" he said. \"Most of them are fighting because of the collateral damage caused by this war.\"</p> <p>Khan's critics, however, accuse him of being dangerously naive.</p> <p>\"This just shows to the Pakistani public how extreme the Taliban world view is,\" said Cyril Almeida, a newspaper columnist who helped coin Khan's unflattering nickname.</p> <p>He said: \"It's this bizarre thing where Taliban Khan is hated by the Taliban, but Taliban Khan's own politics ensures the average Pakistani remains confused about who the Taliban are and what they represent.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>A payday lender has been fined and had its licence taken away by the Office of Fair Trading for the first time \u2013 but is still lending money at interest rates of more than 5,000%.</p> <p>The lender, MCO Capital, has 28 days to appeal against the action taken by the watchdog, which fined it \u00a3544,505 and revoked its licence after the company failed to check the identity of people applying for its loans. This allowed fraudsters to use the personal details of more than 7,000 individuals to successfully apply for loans amounting to millions of pounds. The lender then wrote to people demanding they repay the loans even though it was aware their details may have been used fraudulently and they may not therefore have borrowed the money.</p> <p>The OFT said the lender was in breach of money laundering regulations, which are designed to reduce the risks of businesses being used for money laundering and terrorist financing and require lenders to conduct appropriate identity checks. It also said it had asked MCO to stop the practice of writing to people whose details had been used fraudulently on a number of occasions \u2013 but the lender had ignored it.</p> <p>\"MCO's failure to put adequate procedures in place made it vulnerable to fraud. The way in which MCO then wrote to consumers to collect debts caused unnecessary distress and inconvenience to thousands of people,\" said David Fisher, OFT director of credit.</p> <p>However, the action does not stop the lender from being able to continue to offer high-cost loans to its largely low-income borrowers. MCO was trading online under two websites, Helploan.co.uk and Balanceloan.co.uk, when the fraud occurred. Neither name was licenced and both websites have now been shut down. But MCO is continuing to trade as Paycheckcredit.co.uk, Popcredit.co.uk and Speedcredit.co.uk. Paycheck's typical interest rate on its loans is 5,420%. The OFT cannot stop it trading under these names until the 28-day appeal period has passed.</p> <p>Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for stricter regulation of short-term lenders and described such firms as legal loan sharks, said the practices engaged in by MCO could be commonplace: \"It speaks to widespread concerns about the payday loan industry and there should be more robust procedures in place because this is an industry that is out of control. One in three payday loans are issued to people to pay off an existing loan, so it's welcome to see the OFT tackle payday lenders, but fines of this type will do little to stop them, they are peanuts to these firms. Caps on the cost of credit is needed to tackle payday lenders.\"</p> <p>The biggest name in the payday loan sector is Wonga, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/07/wonga-itv1-red-or-black\" title=\"\">which charges 4,215% APR on it loans and which recently announced its controversial sponsorship of the second series of Simon Cowell's ITV's gameshow Red &amp; Black</a>, hosted by Ant &amp; Dec.</p> <p>Wonga's sponsorship of the high-profile programme, which will use the slogan \"Straight talking money\", immediately came under fire from Creasy. She tweeted on Wednesday, urging people to tweet Ant and Dec's official Twitter account, and email the general inquiry email address of their agent to protest about the sponsorship. \"Wonga is wronga until there's caps on the cost of credit,\" she tweeted.</p> <p>Creasy added today: \"Most payday lenders are doing the same thing [as MCO]. I'll be very interested to see if other firms are found to have done the same thing.\"</p> <p>\"MCO's practices will have caused considerable distress for consumers, so it is good to see this action from the OFT,\" added Sarah Brooks, director of financial services at Consumer Focus. \"However, the difficulty is that currently the OFT has no power to stop the company trading until the appeals process has finished. This means in practice that the firm can continue to treat consumers unfairly and continue to ignore the OFT's request to change its practices.</p> <p>She added: \"This type of business behaviour is appalling and underlines the acute need for the power to revoke licences immediately as the government recently announced it plans to.\"</p> <p>It is the first time the watchdog has fined a payday lender and the first time it has revoked a licence in this sector. Pay day lenders, which lend small loans for short periods but charge huge interest rates, have attracted enormous amounts of criticism in recent years from consumer bodies, debt charities and politicians.</p>",

  "<p>Hospital admissions for injuries caused by dogs have risen 5.2% in England, with young children suffering the most wounds.</p> <p>Around one in six hospital admissions for dog bite and strike injuries involved a child aged under 10, according to provisional data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Of those, almost half required plastic surgery, and more than a quarter led to facial surgery.</p> <p>The most recent figures, for the year ending April 2012, showed a total of 6,450 admissions for dog bites or strikes, an increase of 5.2% on the previous year. Of those 1,040 were of under-10s, with nearly half (494 admissions) requiring plastic surgery, and 27% (278 admissions) resulting in oral or facial surgery.</p> <p>The Hospital Episode Statistics show under-10s accounted for the highest rate of admissions by 10-year age group.</p> <p>Overall, people living in the north-east were more likely to be admitted to hospital following a dog attack. There were 21 admissions per 100,000 of the population, or 551 in total, in the North East Strategic Health Authority's area. Admission rates were lowest in London, where there were seven for every 100,000 of the population.</p> <p>While children were more likely to undergo plastic surgery, admission rates for adults were higher for trauma and orthopaedic treatment.</p> <p>The statistics were greeted with calls for the government to amend legislation aimed at controlling dangerous dogs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Dogs Trust</a>, the UK's largest dog welfare charity, said it was deeply concerned by the rising number of dog attacks. \"We believe it is the responsibility of dog owners to ensure their dogs are properly trained and under control and advise that children should never be left alone with a dog,\" it said.</p> <p>\"Preventing dog attacks is vital and new measures are needed to place more responsibility on the owners of dangerous dogs. Dogs Trust is calling on the government to repeal and replace the existing Dangerous Dogs Act with new legislation that better protects the public and is strongly in favour of compulsory microchipping as it can help improve the traceability of irresponsible dog owners.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.uk/home\" title=\"\">RSPCA</a> animal welfare charity stressed the vast majority of bites treated by the NHS would not necessarily be down to dogs being more aggressive, but rather due to human behaviour around dogs.</p> <p>\"Owning a dog is a privilege with responsibilities, not a right with entitlements. We need strong deterrents to stop owners whose dogs are dangerously out of control and for those people who abuse animals. Tougher sentences will help with the former and need to be applied to the latter,\" it said.</p> <p>\"We need dog owners to be accountable, the law to be enforced and the courts to take dog abuse, abandonment and attacks seriously.\"</p> <p>Children tended to treat pet dogs as their peers, it said, often cuddling and kissing them with very close facial contact, which a dog could find threatening. Children should not be left alone with dogs and warned not to approach them when the dog was eating, had a toy or possession, was sleeping, sick, injured, in pain, tired or had hearing or vision impairment.</p> <p>RSPCA guidelines show gestures from dogs showing they are feeling uncomfortable include yawning, lip licking, averting their gaze, turning their head away, dropping ears, crouching, low wagging, tucking their tail under and rolling over on their backs.</p>",
  "<p>Researchers from Michigan State University in the US have found nearly as many as <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57487619-10391704/parents-publicly-spank-their-kids-in-surprising-numbers-researchers/\" title=\"\">one in four parents or caregivers slap their children in public</a>. Or, to use the academic term, the children are at the receiving end of what their study calls \"negative touch\" \u2013 anything from arm-pulling to pinching. Lead researcher Dr Kathy Stansbury wrote: \"I was very surprised to see what many people consider a socially undesirable behaviour done by nearly a quarter of the caregivers.\"</p> <p>The first part of Stansbury's statement made me pause. Is smacking really a \"socially undesirable behaviour\"? I was reminded of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/science/08tier.html\" title=\"\">psychologist Jonathan Haidt</a>'s argument that there is a liberal bias in academics, especially in the social sciences. So I asked the question on social media. All but one respondent replied with a \"yes, it's undesirable\", with some stretching to \"undesirable and (it should be) criminal\". Hmm. Perhaps I was the one out of touch here.</p> <p>I was also surprised at the percentage of caregivers who operated with a \"negative touch\" policy \u2013 I'd have expected it to be considerably higher. Full disclosure: I was smacked as a child. At home, I had taps on the backs of my legs, rulers on the flat of my hands and \u2013 a couple of memorable times \u2013 the tongue of a belt on the palm.</p> <p>This form of discipline had pretty much ceased by the time I was about 10, but then I went to secondary school. Corporal punishment was normal and sanctioned by the school system (as it had been in most Nigerian primary schools), and I felt the sting of more than a few canes across my backside over the years. I can barely remember the \"crimes\" committed, or the actual caning encounters, but at the time I must have cried like a baby and raged like a movie super villain.</p> <p>There's a Yoruba saying: \"<em>Aya omode ni were di si, egba la o fi tu</em>\", which roughly translates as \"the madness which resides in the chest of a child can be undone with a cane\". Interestingly, the Michigan State study found that \"kids disciplined with positive touch were more likely to comply more often and more quickly with less fussing\".</p> <p>As an adult, I have made a conscious decision that if and when I have children, I will not smack them. My decision does not stem from a deep well of emotional trauma: I do not consider myself to have been abused. I think that is due to the environment I was in: the context was that almost everyone I knew was smacked. It was, for want of a better word, \"normal\". But for all of my positive (an odd word, I know) experience of this form of punishment, I just reckon that smacking is not the variable that guarantees \"good\" children.</p> <p>I, along with a bunch of friends, was smacked and we turned out undamaged. But then, a lot of my friends and peers weren't smacked and they're responsible, undamaged adults too. Of course, it works the other way too, which suggests to me that smacking is not the deciding factor here.</p> <p>The language we use when we talk about smacking children is interesting. There is obviously a clear line between \"smacking\" and \"abuse\" but both are often used interchangeably in the course of this debate. There are children who have been brutalised by their caregivers under the umbrella term of \"smacking\" and \"discipline\". This was not my experience, and I doubt it is for the millions of children who are smacked. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting\" title=\"\">Parenting</a> is a personal thing, often done publicly. And it's worth remembering that the social stigma of smacking does not seem to be stopping a determined set of parents from \"disciplining\" their children this way.</p> <p>The law as it stands has a \"reasonable chastisement\" clause, which permits mild smacking. And that's how it should stay \u2013 parents need some autonomy in deciding on how to raise their own children.</p>",

Some of the playing Bychkov drew from his new orchestra was truly exceptional, notably in the woodwinds.</p> <p>If the Unfinished brought to mind <a href=\"http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/ideasv61/burnham.htm\" title=\"\">Schumann's famous phrase</a> about the \"heavenly length\" of Schubert's final symphony, <a href=\"http://www.richarddubugnon.com/\" title=\"\">Richard Dubugnon's Battlefield Concerto</a>, premiered in LA a year ago, rather overstayed its welcome. The concerto, in nine not very distinctly defined sections played without a break, is a vehicle for the piano-playing <a href=\"http://www.labeque.com/index.php/bio\" title=\"\">Lab\u00e8que sisters</a> (Bychkov is married to Marielle Lab\u00e8que). There is lots going on in this piece, and Bychkov kept the orchestra under tight control in order to keep the spotlight on the prodigiously industrious soloists, but the concerto lacked a distinct personality, and its self-proclaimed connections to Paolo Uccello's <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paolo-uccello-the-battle-of-san-romano\" title=\"\">battle paintings</a> were&nbsp;elusive.</p> <p>No such doubts about <a href=\"http://imslp.org/wiki/Ein\\_Heldenleben,_Op.40_(Strauss,_Richard)\" title=\"\">Strauss's Ein Heldenleben</a>. Here Bychkov was on home ground, and if at times his reading felt oddly austere for this ravishingly preening orchestral work, the playing again made clear that the new relationship between the BBC orchestra and Bychkov will offer some unmissable&nbsp;evenings.</p> <p>\u2022 If you're at any Prom this summer, tweet your thoughts about it to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardianmusic/\" title=\"\">@guardianmusic</a> using the hashtag #proms and we'll pull what you've got to say into one of our weekly roundups \u2013 or leave your comments below.</p>",
  "<h2>What is the \"ample\" evidence against Gu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun?<br></h2> <p>We do not know and are unlikely to find out. It is likely to have come from witness statements and confessions. Witnesses rarely give evidence in person in the Chinese system \u2013 meaning there is no cross-examination. Confessions are likely to have been given in circumstances that would render them inadmissible in a British court.</p> <h2>Why did Heywood fly to Chongqing to meet Gu Kailai and what was the nature of their economic conflict?<br></h2> <p>The nature of their economic ties are unclear. He appears to have handled some of her financial affairs. There were previously claims that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/16/neil-heywood-expose-gu-kailai\" title=\"\">investigators believed he was funnelling money overseas for her</a>, leading to a row when he sought a larger cut. Although he had been part of her inner circle, friends say the relationship had cooled long before his death. He may have hoped that Gu's invitation meant she wanted to build bridges.</p> <h2>Why did Gu's defence lawyer claim that Heywood bore \"a certain responsibility\" for the cause of his death?<br></h2> <p>This appears to be a reference to the assertion that Gu believed Heywood was a threat to her son, but no explicit link is made.</p> <h2> Why did Gu believe that Heywood might pose a threat to her son?<br></h2> <p>Again, no indication is given. Friends of the Briton strongly dispute the suggestion, saying that it simply was not in his character and that he was closer to Bo Guagua than other members of the family. Bo Guagua said before the trial that he had submitted a statement because he was cited as a motivating factor in the alleged crime, but did not elaborate.</p> <h2> Why did Heywood get drunk with Gu?<br></h2> <p>Friends became suspicious when Heywood's death was initially ascribed to excessive drinking because he was known as only a light drinker. Yet the new account suggests he was already so drunk he had vomited before the poison was administered.</p> <h2> Why was Zhang needed to carry the poison?<br></h2> <p>The account says Gu prepared the poison and administered it herself. It is unclear why she gave it to her aide in between.</p> <h2> Whose crimes has Gu informed on, according to the defence?<br></h2> <p>No indication is given. It could refer to her co-accused, Zhang \u2013 although she reportedly requested a lighter sentence for him during the hearing \u2013 or the four police officers due to stand trial for covering up for her. Others wonder if her husband could face criminal charges. No comment has been made on his case since the announcement that he was under investigation for suspected disciplinary violations.</p> <p>Some analysts previously thought that, if anything, the signals suggested that leaders wanted to deal with him through internal party processes.</p> <h2> In what way was Gu's ability to control her behaviour \"weaker than normal people's\" at the time of the crime, according to her defence?</h2> <p>This may be intended to imply she was suffering from mental health problems, which could be regarded as a mitigating factor. She is thought to have experienced depression in the past.</p>",
  "<p>The victims of the Sikh temple shootings in Wisconsin have been remembered at a series of solemn events across the US, as people gathered to urge religious tolerance and greater gun controls.</p> <p>In New York, hundreds took part in a candlelight vigil in Union Square honouring the six people killed by Wade Michael Page at the Wisconsin Sikh Temple in Oak Creek on Sunday. It was a scene that played out across the US as people came together to remember those caught up in America's latest shooting atrocity and to urge political leaders to act.</p> <p>The event in New York was coordinated by the Manhattan Sikh Association and began around 7.30pm ET. Organizers handed out dark blue bandanas for attendees to cover their heads, white T-shirts that read \"We Are All Sikhs\" and hundreds of small electronic candles.</p> <p>As six people stood in a line and each held a photo of an Oak Creek victim with their name below, a series of interfaith speakers took the podium to urge an elimination of religion-based discrimination and push for gun control in the hopes of preventing further hate crimes.</p> <p>\"It's so easy to come together when there's a terrible tragedy. It's more difficult to come together when things are going well because we get caught up in our day-to-day lives, we re-erect the walls that separate us and we wait until the next tragedy,\" said one of the speakers, a rabbi.</p> <p>Near him, a woman draped in an American flag head covering stood silently as he spoke. \"Well, it can't be that way any more,\" the rabbi continued. \"It's really time to demonstrate every day \u2013 not just on a terrible day like today \u2013 to demonstrate every day that we are one, that we are in this together, that our skin colours, that our religion and our nation of origin is meaningless in the face of our unified humanity.\"</p> <p>Near the end of the vigil, with the plaza at Union Square nearly filled, supporters were asked for a moment of silence to remember each of the victims. At that point, they turned on their electronic candles and lifted them up against the night sky in a show of nationwide solidarity.</p> <p>Similar scenes were witnessed across the US as people continued to commemorate the victims. Scores of Sikh temples took part in vigils on Wednesday. In Michigan, 500 people gathered at a gurdwada in the Detroit suburb of Plymouth.</p> <p>Sikh places of worship opened their doors to those previously unfamiliar to the tenets of the faith, with a temple in San Jose among many that gave newcomers required head coverings.</p> <p>The vigils began earlier this week. On Tuesday, residents of Oak Creek turned out in their hundreds to join members of the Sikh community at the site of the shootings. At that event, local police chief John Edwards addressed those gathered, telling them that he was struck by the reaction of the temple-goers, in their lack of hatred and focus on \"compassion, concern and support\".</p> <p>The calls for calm and understanding come despite an emerging picture of the killer as a man driven by racial hatred. Page, a former US soldier who had been kicked out of the army for being drunk on duty and going absent without leave, was a member of the white power music scene.</p> <p>He sometimes performed with a Nazi swastika hanging behind the group, and his first band, Definite Hate, produced an album called Violent Victory, with a cover design of a white fist punching a black face.</p> <p>Community leaders are scheduled to hold more unity events at cities across America on Thursday evening.</p> <p>On its Facebook page, Punjabi Radio USA, which is helping publicise the vigils, urged: \"Now is the time to show the world that we as human beings can rise above the ignorance and violence that still exists today. Now is the time to come together in peace and solidarity. Now is the time to stand against hatred towards anyone.\"</p>",
  "<p>BSkyB's share price briefly touched a nine-month high on Thursday as shareholders warmed to its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/08/bskyb-sky-sports\" title=\"\">victory over Ofcom in the battle over the wholesale pricing of Sky Sports channels</a>.</p> <p>The satellite broadcaster's share price rose 19p, more than 2.5%, to 762p in early trading on Thursday as investors welcomed the Competition Appeal Tribunal's ruling, which looks set to reverse Ofcom's decision to cut the wholesale price at which it sells Sky Sports 1 and 2 to competitors.</p> <p>Sky's stock market surge saw the satellite broadcaster briefly hit its highest share price since the beginning of December last year.</p> <p>The ruling is a serious setback for Ofcom. The media regulator takes pride in its historically airtight evidence-based approach to investigations. But the CAT ruling contradicts Ofcom work dating back to 2007 relating to BSkyB's power in the UK pay-TV market.</p> <p>\"This is a big blow for Ofcom to be told that they have misinterpreted the evidence, it flies in the face of everything that Ofcom is based on,\" said Will Smith, media analyst at Jefferies.</p> <p>The defeat, which Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi, called an \"extraordinary outcome\", follows last Thursday's publication of the Competition Commission's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/02/bskyb-power-rivals-competition-commission?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">report clearing BSkyB</a> of being anti-competitive in the pay-TV movie market.</p> <p>Ofcom, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/20/bskyb-pay-tv-movies-ofcom?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">vigorously disagreed</a> with that decision, is sticking to its guns, arguing that the CAT has made a mistake in the pay-TV sport market.</p> <p>The regulator believes that BSkyB is too dominant in the UK pay-TV market as a whole, pointing out that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/02/bskyb-power-rivals-competition-commission?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Competition Commission agreed with this</a> in its ruling last week.</p> <p>In its report on the pay-TV movie market last week Laura Carstensen, chairman of the inquiry group at the Competition Commission, said that the BSkyB has \"market power\" over rivals in the pay-TV sector and that \"competition is not effective\".</p> <p>Nevertheless the <a href=\"http://www.catribunal.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CAT's often critical assessment</a> of the media regulator's work \u2013 at one point it scathingly says it found \"a significant number of Ofcom's pivotal findings of fact in the statement to be inconsistent with the evidence\" \u2013 will mean a finely balanced decision needs to be made on whether to lodge an appeal.</p> <p>Ofcom declined to comment on whether it plans to appeal. A board meeting needs to be held to assess the situation and a final decision will be made before the CAT's deadline in early October.</p> <p>\"An appeal by Ofcom looks likely given the questioning of such a major body of work (the regulator took three years to conduct the review),\" is the assessment of Laurie Davison, media analyst at Deutsche Bank. \"So, most likely, we are still in legal limbo with no clear date for resolution.\"</p> <p>As a result Deutsche Bank kept its estimates of BSkyB's financial performance, target share price and rating steady. Investors also cottoned on to the likelihood that BSkyB has won a significant victory but is nowhere near winning the regulatory war, with the company's share price coming back down to a minimal lift for the day at 753p.</p> <p>If BSkyB eventually does win the battle to allow it to set its own price for what it charges rivals to carry for Sky Sports 1 and 2 then it could have major ramifications for BT in particular.</p> <p>In June BT became the first rival in 20 years to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/premier-league-tv-rights-3-billion-sky-bt?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">snatch a package of the best Premier League games from BSkyB</a>, with a \u00a3735m bid to secure 38 matches a season in the three years from 2013.</p> <p>To make the most of its rights a number of observers have argued that BT should withhold the matches from being aired on Sky, to maximise value to subscribers of BT Vision, while Ofcom's order still forces BSkyB to offer its matches on Sky Sports 1 and 2 to the telecoms company and other rivals.</p> <p>If BSkyB were to win the battle to have the \"wholesale must offer\" order scrapped then it could force BT to offer its football matches to Sky or face having Sky Sports pulled off BT Vision.</p> <p>\"This could potentially be used as a negotiating lever to encourage BT to wholesale its newly-won Premier League rights, or to withhold and severely impair their TV/triple play offer,\" said Davison.</p> <p>The CAT's report reveals that Ofcom tried to get the hearing reopened in June, but was denied as it was felt it would prolong the already lengthy process.</p> <p>Ofcom was keen to add evidence relating to the bidding war for Premier League matches between BSkyB and new entrant BT in June.</p> <p>Sky's challenge to Ofcom had the backing of sports governing bodies including the Football Association, the Rugby Football Union and the England and Wales Cricket Board \u2013 which warned of the \"serious consequences\" and \"irreparable damage\" at grassroots level of taking money from Sky.</p> <p>However, this did not appear to be the case with the Premier League, which in June secured a 71% increase in the value of UK live TV rights for the next three-year period to a record \u00a33bn, thanks to a bidding war between BSkyB and BT.</p> <p>In a statement BT said that it intends to bide its time and mull the full ramifications of the ruling before deciding what action to take.</p> <p>\"It's open to BT and the other parties to apply for permission to appeal against the tribunal's decision on points of law only,\" said a BT spokesman. \"Any appeal would be to the court of appeal and the application would need to be brought within one month of the tribunal handing down the public version of its full judgment expected in late September. Given that the tribunal has only released a summary of its judgment publicly, we will await the public version of the full judgment before commenting further.\"</p> <p>A number of observers believe it would be futile for Virgin Media and BT to challenge the ruling.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

What a combination. Elektra and Miranda Kilbey are two sisters, barely out of school, who grew up flitting between Australia and Sweden and now work as a duo called Saint Lou Lou.

Their frequent peregrinations from north to south, cold and dark to sunny and bright, apparently impacted deeply on their psyches. We're no shrinks, but we do recognise the delicate sound of thunderous yearning when we hear it, and this pair obviously spent their formative years in a near-permanent state of longing for the Other Place. \"When you're constantly travelling back and forth between the opposite ends of the world, you can end up feeling like you're stuck somewhere in between,\" they have said, in an attempt to explain the aching sense of displacement that informs their songs.</p> <p>They're pop songs, not indie or electronic ones, even though you can see the alternative crowd digging them and detect elements of the latter creeping into their construction, which takes place in Stockholm with their co-writers Addeboy Vs Cliff \u2013 who produced their imminent debut single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vrUxtXqIbE\" title=\"\">Maybe You</a> \u2013 and Patrick Berger, who is <a href=\"http://vikavikavika.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/berger.jpg\" title=\"\">a retired Czech footballer</a> as well as sometime knob-twiddler for Robyn. Oh, all right, they're different Patrick Bergers. Just trying to lighten the mood, which is so deliciously sad you can taste it. In fact, super-chic French label Kitsun\u00e9 liked the flavour straight away, signing them as soon as they heard the demo of Maybe You. Now the girls are planning to move to London to finish their debut album, due in 2013.</p> <p>Let's just hope they don't get too happy while they're here because, let's face it, we all know what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/24/olympics-opening-ceremony-rehearsal\" title=\"\">a crazy fun town</a> the capital is right now. Even we wouldn't sanction mental torment just for our personal delight; we are simply cautiously advising Elektra and Miranda, if they'll forgive our informality, to retain that special quality of misery that serves their music so well. As commercial pop goes, Maybe You is less fizzy than forlorn, and the words are tremendous, existentialist angst-poetry for teens on Twitter. Miraculously, it's no one-off. We have been privy (we always lapse into Shakespearean when we're excited) to two further tracks, demos that prove even without the finishing studio touches these tunes work.

  "<p>It is now widely acknowledged that an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">armed conflict is taking place across Syria</a> between government forces (including militias) and organised armed opposition groups. This means the laws of war (also known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law\" title=\"\">international humanitarian law</a>, or IHL) apply and bind all sides, and violations may amount to war crimes.</p> <p>These detailed laws have been in force for decades, so we are a long way from the days when it could be said that in times of war the law falls silent. But the basic principles of the laws of war are still surprisingly little understood. The words \"war criminal\" seem to be mostly used as a term of derision, rather than a statement of fact, let alone a requirement to prosecute. Therefore it is vital to understand the basic principles of IHL when considering what is going on in Syria today.</p> <p>The most basic principle of all is that all parties fighting in the conflict must distinguish between combatants and civilians, and take \"all feasible precautions\" at all times to protect civilians and civilian property. Civilians, and civilian objects \u2013 eg homes, schools, hospitals \u2013 may never be the object of attack, so they can never be specifically targeted.</p> <p>This does not mean that every civilian death is a violation of IHL. The parties can target military objectives, including enemy fighters and weapons, but also civilian buildings and bridges being used by enemy forces. Civilians who are taking \"a direct part in hostilities\" can be attacked for the period they have joined in the fight, including civilian leaders commanding forces. At the same time, fighters who have been taken out of combat, such as through being seriously wounded or captured, or who have surrendered, are entitled to protection from attack.</p> <p>International law does not just prohibit targeting civilians. It prohibits indiscriminate attacks, those that do not or cannot distinguish between military targets and civilians. This can be when attacks are not directed at a military objective or when the weapons or their particular use are inherently indiscriminate, as in many cases of shelling of populated areas. Even if the attackers are targeting a clear military objective, they may not mount attacks where the anticipated loss of civilian life or damage to civilian property is disproportionate to the expected military advantage to be gained.</p> <p>Defenders as well as attackers are required to take all feasible steps to protect civilians. This means all sides must avoid deploying military targets such as fighters or weapons in or near densely populated areas, and they must try to remove civilians from areas of military operations.</p> <p>An example of the requirement to always distinguish between military targets and civilian objects would be attacks on a television station. The station could only be directly attacked if it were being used for direct military purposes, such as relaying military orders. Simply broadcasting pro-government or opposition propaganda is not a justification for attack. On the other hand, if one side were to send its fighters into the TV station, the other side could target those fighters so long as the attack did not violate the rules on indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks.</p> <p>A key area in which many abuses take place in conflict is in the treatment of detainees, and so application of the law is critically needed here. Both IHL and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law\" title=\"\">international human rights law</a> \u2013 which continues to apply at all times \u2013 protect all detainees, strictly prohibiting executions, torture and other abuse. The most fundamental principles of human rights law apply even during genuine emergencies, including the requirements that all detention is subject to judicial review and that only courts of law may try and convict people.</p> <p>But law needs enforcement, which is where prosecuting war crimes is critical. War crimes are essentially serious violations of IHL committed by individuals with criminal intent. They are committed not just by the fighters who carry them out, but those who order them, and those who assist, aid or abet those fighters. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/special-court-for-sierra-leone\" title=\"\">Sierra Leone special court</a>'s conviction of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor shows that those who give assistance to forces knowing they are committing war crimes may be responsible themselves for aiding and abetting those crimes. Commanders, military or civilian, may also be criminally responsible for war crimes committed by their subordinates that they should have known about and that they failed to prevent or prosecute.</p> <p>While prosecuting Syrians implicated in war crimes should in principle take place in Syria, this could be done in the many countries that accept universal jurisdiction for these crimes. In reality, at this point, the one court that could prosecute war crimes by all sides \u2013 as well as the well-documented crimes against humanity committed by government forces during the past year \u2013 is the international criminal court.</p> <p>But that court will only realistically have jurisdiction in Syria if the UN security council refers the situation in Syria to the court, which means a much more united and concerted push than we have seen to date by European countries and others to obtain such a resolution. The real prospect of being pursued around the world for war crimes will do more than anything else to persuade commanders to ensure that their forces comply with the law and that civilians are spared the worst of the conflict.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's controversial bid to import some Olympic wrestling success ended in conspicuous failure when the host nation's sole representative, the Ukrainian-reared Olga Butkevych, was beaten in her opening bout. The 26-year-old was too upset to talk after losing to Ecuador's Lissette Antes Castillo in the closing seconds of a contest she had been expected to win.</p> <p>The disappointing result may well have repercussions for the funding of GB wrestling but Shaun Morley, the British Wrestling performance director, said that Butkevych, who qualified for a British passport only in May, had been unlucky and would be back to represent her adopted country in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.</p> <p>\"Olga's absolutely devastated,\" said Morley, admitting it was \"a possibility\" his sport's funding could now be cut. \"She made a slight tactical error in the last five seconds and that was the difference between winning and losing. Tactically and technically she was the better athlete.\"</p> <p>The outcome, though, is certain to intensify the debate over the wisdom of recruiting Eastern Europeans rather than developing home-based talent. Butkevych, one of a number of foreign-born wrestlers who originally came to Britain five years ago as sparring partners, was greeted warmly by the crowd, keen to witness a first GB medal in the sport since 1984.</p> <p>Until the last five seconds of the final round in the 55kg category she had looked in control only to be hurled out of the ring at the worst possible moment. Morley remains adamant her selection will ultimately prove a good thing. \"We've spent four years developing strategies to move wrestling forward in this country. I would hope this will prove positive in terms of showcasing the sport.

  "<p>\"It's only two weeks\" was ITV's stiff upper lip approach as the London 2012 Olympics opened on 27 July. The broadcaster has duly trotted out a low-cost summer schedule of soap and detective drama repeats, from Vera to Poirot and Midsomer Murders \u2013 and been totally thrashed.</p> <p>With massive audiences flocking to the BBC's coverage, from the 27 million peak for the opening ceremony onwards \u2013 and the public catching results on their smartphone or online \u2013it made absolute sense for the BBC to have sealed its exclusive rights contract for the Olympics up to 2020 just before the London Games opened.</p> <p>However, London 2012 didn't have to be such a BBC fest. One cannot help wonder if \"the people's channel\" would love to turn back the clock.</p> <p>ITV covered the Olympics in 1968, 1972, 1980 and 1988, and for several decades strove to reach a fair accommodation to share coverage with the BBC, before bowing out after the Seoul Games.</p> <p>In 1988 ITV co-operated in covering the Seoul Olympics with Channel 4, which provided overnight and breakfast coverage. This solved another key ITV problem before the onset of multichannel television: the BBC had two channels (BBC1 and BBC2) to screen coverage; ITV had only one.</p> <p>The official history of independent television in Britaincharts the disjointed story of ITV's Olympics coverage. The Olympics was named as one of the list of non-exclusive sporting events back in 1956, when ITV first went on air, and the regional companies made it a special network event.</p> <p>ITV made strenuous efforts to muscle its way into sharing top sporting rights. But this led to fierce rivalry with the BBC, which has covered the Olympics unbroken since 1960, and was proud of technical advances, including coverage in colour on BBC2 for the first time from the Mexico City Games in 1968.</p> <p>Throughout the 1970s there was a constant negotiation over avoiding duplication of Olympic events, and alternating coverage to save money. But they failed to agree on sharing coverage for the Olympics in 1972, 1976 and 1980, and the football World Cup finals in 1974 and 1978.</p> <p>In practice the 1972 the Munich Olympics was covered by ITV principally through extended ITN news bulletins. In 1976 ITV abandoned its plans for the Montreal Games, after the IBA \u2013 then the commercial TV regulator \u2013 asked the BBC governors for a form of alternation in coverage, only for the BBC management to speak of \"total war\".</p> <p>But ITV's decision not to cover the Los Angeles Games in 1984 was key to the decision to withdraw from the Olympics altogether. It was about cost and commercial returns. The official history of ITV records \"extraordinary demands made for working overseas\" from heavily unionised technicians. Camera crews travelled first class, received daily allowances, expected first class hotels \u2013 a disincentive on ITV companies to authorise any shooting overseas.</p> <p>So in 1984 all ITV coverage of the Olympics was cancelled, rather than take an extra production assistant to Los Angeles and create an expensive precedent. An accompanying table in the book shows that after a strike in 1979 average annual earnings for ITV employees jumped 73% in 1980. So the Olympics became a BBC-only event.</p> <p>Freed of commercial breaks, viewers would probably say that's a jolly good outcome.</p>",

  "<p><em>I read about Mat Honan, the journalist who had his email hacked and his devices wiped. What should we all be doing to avoid this kind of thing?</em><br><strong>Sarah Taylor</strong><br><br>For those who missed the story, Wired journalist Mat Honan had his Gmail and Twitter accounts hacked, which is not all that unusual. What made the story \"epic\" was that the hacker(s) used his Apple iCloud account to perform a \"remote wipe\" on his iPhone, iPad and MacBook, deleting all his data. Worse still, he didn't have backups.</p> <p>It was evident that something had gone wrong from the tweets the hacker sent from Honan's Twitter account and Gizmodo's account, to which it was linked. (He used to work there.) Honan went public on 3 August 2012 in a blogpost: <a href=\"http://www.emptyage.com/post/28679875595/yes-i-was-hacked-hard\">Yes, I was hacked. Hard.</a> At the time, he blamed his old seven-digit alphanumeric password.</p> <p>Honan followed up on Monday 6 August with a full account in Wired: <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/\">How Apple and Amazon Security Flaws Led to My Epic Hacking</a>. It turned out that it was not a password crack but \"social engineering\". The hacker had phoned AppleCare technical support and been given a temporary password to Honan's .Me account. Honan says: \"It did this despite the caller's inability to answer security questions I had set up. And it did this after the hacker supplied only two pieces of information that anyone with an internet connection and a phone can discover \u2026 a billing address and the last four digits of my credit card.\"</p> <p>The billing address came from the Whois data that Honan had used to register his domain name, and the credit card numbers from Amazon. (See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/aug/08/apple-amazon-patch-security\">Apple and Amazon patch security flaws exposed by hack heard round the world</a> for more details.)</p> <p>Once the hacker had control of Honan's email, he could get the passwords reset on other accounts, such as Twitter.</p> <p>There are several things that will help prevent this from happening to you. These include: (1) use two-factor authentication; (2) don't put all your eggs in one basket; and most of all (3) backup, backup, backup.</p> <h2>Two-factor authentication</h2> <p>With two-factor authentication, security depends on two different things. Often these are something you have, such as a credit card, and something you know, such as a four-digit pin (personal identification number). The \"something you have\" could also be a dongle or, with biometrics, your face, fingerprints, or iris patterns. With online services, it's usually a mobile phone. Set up two-factor authentication with Gmail, for example, and when you ask for your forgotten password to be reset, Google will send a verification code to your mobile. </p> <p>Google's Matt Cutts has posted a video on how to do this: <a href=\"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/google-two-step-authentication/\">Please turn on two-factor authentication</a>.</p> <p>Facebook introduced a similar system in May 2011. For instructions, see <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150172618258920\">Introducing Login Approvals</a>: \"[It] requires you to enter a code we send to your mobile phone via text message whenever you log into Facebook from a new or unrecognized computer. Once you have entered this security code, you'll have the option to save the device to your account so that you don't see this challenge on future logins.\"</p> <p>But two-factor authentication can be somewhat tedious, and also there's the risk of losing your mobile. Perhaps it might be worth using an old smartphone with a prepaid (PAYG or \"pay as you go\") account for this single purpose.</p> <h2>Eggs in multiple baskets\u2026</h2> <p>I've given this advice numerous times, but it's risky to put all your eggs in one basket. Honan was an extreme case in his dependence on Apple's iCloud, but many people are dependent on Google or Microsoft or even Yahoo. The question is, if you lost access to your account, would you also lose access to your calendar, contacts, online photos, documents, and other data?</p> <p>Apple, for example, wants you to use a single ID (identity) for iCloud, its App Store, buying things from iTunes etc. This is a bad idea. As far as possible, you should use different IDs, passwords, and even different credit cards for different purposes. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo have also been pushing people towards using the same account for multiple services on multiple devices, and this will get worse when a Microsoft ID is used to log on to Windows 8.</p> <p>Your stuff will be more secure if you spread it around.</p> <p>If you must use a single supplier, make sure you have backups elsewhere. For example, most email services provide \"mail forwarding\". Set this up so that every email that reaches (say) your Gmail inbox is automatically sent to a Yahoo, Hotmail or other inbox as well.</p> <p>Microsoft has just launched an improved email service at Outlook.com to replace Hotmail. Register and you can get your new Outlook inbox to fetch all the emails from your Gmail or other account, providing a backup. You've missed the opening \"land grab\" but plenty of good outlook.com names should still be available.</p> <h2>\u2026 and multiple email accounts</h2> <p>I hadn't considered this before, but Honan's case also shows that there is a risk in using the same email address for all your online accounts, which is exactly what I do. I must have a couple of dozen accounts for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Quora, Bitly and so on, but all the password reset tokens would end up in the same email inbox.</p> <p>It would be more secure, but not as handy, to use a different email address for each service. This isn't impractical if you use a desktop email program such as Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, or Microsoft Outlook, because a single \"send/receive all mail\" will collect email from multiple email accounts. If these addresses are only used for passwords and similar purposes, there should not be much email to collect. I'm now thinking about setting up WLM for this purpose. </p> <p>Creating programmatic email addresses (xyz4twitter@outlook.com, xyz4quora@outlook.com etc) would make things simpler, but if you take this approach, think of a format that's less easy to guess.</p> <h2>Backup, backup, backup</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/feb/14/email.yahoo\">Schofield's Second Law of Computing</a> says data doesn't really exist unless you have two copies of it. Preferably more. And the only person who can be held responsible for that is you. </p> <p>A simple solution is to have a desktop or laptop PC backed up to an external hard drive and synchronised using a program such as <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/freefilesync/\">FreeFileSync</a>, which is what I happen to use. There are lots of alternatives. Ideally, you should also store copies of important things online, using a service such as Dropbox, Carbonite or Mozy.</p> <p>Since your online storage can be hacked and deleted, it is vital to have physical backups on one or more external hard drives, thumb drives, SD cards, CD-Roms or DVDs. For more on this topic, see an earlier answer: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2012/feb/23/ask-jack-backup-data-storage\">CD, DVD or SD: what's best for backups?</a>.</p> <p>One extra advantage of having 16GB of data on an SD card or USB memory stick is that you can keep it \"off site\" in a trusted friend or relative's house. This provides some protection from physical threats such as earthquakes, flooding, fire and theft.</p> <p>If you use a service that allows devices to be wiped remotely, this increases the need to have separate backups. Honan fell victim to Apple's optional Find My Mac feature, which allows users to locate and wipe a stolen device. There are similar services such as <a href=\"http://preyproject.com/\">Prey</a>, which also works on Windows, Linux and Android. Use with care.</p> <h2>A cloudy future</h2> <p>There's clearly a trend towards keeping data online (\"in the cloud\" is the new jargon) and accessing it from numerous devices including PCs, tablets and smartphones. While this can be convenient, it also brings risks. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/10/it.security\"> Schofield's Third Law of Computing</a> states: \"The easier it is for you to access your data, the easier it is for someone else to access your data.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://xkcd.com/936/\">Strong passwords</a> don't protect you if someone using the same public Wi-Fi can easily hijack your session cookies with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep\">Firesheep</a> and get instant access to your email and Facebook accounts. (See my previous answer, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2012/may/17/vpn-internet-privacy-security\">Using a VPN to protect your web use</a>.) </p> <p>Also, it's now scarily easy to add a cheap, inconspicuous <a href=\"http://bit.ly/O6svFV\">keylogger</a> to any publicly accessible computer, as I was recently reminded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Codepope\"> DJ Walker-Morgan</a>.</p> <p>Honan wrote: \"My experience leads me to believe that cloud-based systems need fundamentally different security measures. Password-based security mechanisms \u2013 which can be cracked, reset, and socially engineered \u2013 no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing.\"</p> <p>Until we come up with something better, <em>always use secure https connections</em> rather than http, when available. We now need all websites to support https all the time.</p>",
  "<p>Despite having a few articles up on here already, as one of the new additions to the ranks of the Guardian's science bloggers, it seemed appropriate to introduce myself more fully. A quick potted history of my research and outreach activities seems sensible, though as might have already been gathered I'm a palaeontologist specialising in the non-avian dinosaurs and their close relatives the pterosaurs.</p> <p>I've always been keen on animals for as long as I can remember and spent many a long hour dragging my parents around zoos and museums just desperate to see animals of all shapes and sizes. I was determined to be a biologist of some description and was intent on making a career of studying animals. While dinosaurs were always part of this, they were never really a huge draw for me, or at least no more than any other group, and I rather fell into them by chance. </p> <p>As such I started off my academic career reading zoology where I rather specialised in animal behaviour and locomotion. This was followed by a masters based at the Natural History Museum in London and where I ended up writing about the evolution of dinosaur size for my thesis. That in turn led me to have the opportunity to pursue a palaeontologically based PhD looking at the origins of the pterosaurs and that was pretty much it: I was a palaeontologist.</p> <p>Following my doctorate in 2005 I spent two years working in Munich and then onto Beijing for a further three years before taking up a short lecturing post in Dublin. Starting in Munich I was able to get to grips with the aspects of palaeontology I'm most interested and involved in \u2013 the ecology and behaviour of the dinosaurs. </p> <p>However, like most researchers I've covered quite a range of topics in my research (<a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=S-VueuQAAAAJ\">as you can see here</a>) with bits of work on dinosaur teeth, pterosaur wing membranes, fossil footprints, the preservation of fossil feathers and more, and I've also been responsible for naming a number of new dinosaur species. Most recently though, I've been able to develop my work on the socio-sexual behaviour of dinosaurs and on the predatory behaviour of the theropods and have published a series of papers exploring these issues and with some more in the pipeline.</p> <p>From a young age I've been actively involved in various outreach projects and science communication efforts and this blog is simply the latest in quite a line for me. Aside from a variety of talks, presentations and magazine articles I've started up a number of online projects. The forerunner to this was my blog <a href=\"http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/\">Archosaur Musings</a> which is rather more technical than Lost Worlds is intended to be. Musings is still ticking over in the background and there's nearly five years' worth of material on there for those who want more detail on their dinosaurs. I managed a post a day for much of that time and naturally ended up covering a great deal of material, and some of the most important and interesting pieces I hope to update and recapitulate here on occasion. </p> <p>With a number of colleagues I set up <a href=\"pterosaur.net\">Pterosaur.net</a> as an online resource on pterosaurs, as they seem to suffer particularly from being confused with both dinosaurs and birds, and there is an occasional accompanying blog for the site too.</p> <p>Finally, my big outreach project is <a href=\"http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/\">Ask A Biologist</a>. Set up about five years ago now, this is there to provide direct access to scientists and try to break down the perceived barriers between researchers and the public. Anyone can leave any question about biology and have it answered (well, hopefully) by one of a panel of academics and researchers with a very wide-ranging set of specialisations. To date we've answered more than 6,000 questions (all of which are archived on the site) and have, I hope, really helped educate and inform people with even the most casual interest in biology. </p> <p>Oh yes, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dave_Hone\">I'm on Twitter too</a>.</p> <p>That's it really. I do a lot of dinosaurs, a fair bit of pterosaurs and I'm especially interested in the ecology and behaviour of these extinct reptiles. As a result, you can expect a fair bit of that on here in the coming weeks and months, but I also intend to write a fair bit about new discoveries and changing ideas about dinosaurs and indeed other fossil finds too with a liberal dose of science communication, evolution and the like. </p> <p>If you want to know a bit more, well you can explore those sites and I've done a couple of interviews over the years (<a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2009/08/paleo-profile-of-david-hone-china-blogging-and-bone-eating-dinosaurs/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.webvies.net/dinosaurcouch/2012/02/02/interview-with-david-hone/\">here</a>) about my work that may be of interest.</p>",
  "<p>Something interesting is happening to the legal services market in Scotland.</p> <p>Firstly, like everywhere else, Scotland is feeling the effects of a double dip recession. This has shrunk the legal sector, dried up a good deal of commercial and domestic property work and left smaller law firms concentrating their billable time on wills, trusts and executries.</p> <p>For the medium to large firms in the Scottish market, however, the seismic event of the past few years has been the falling away of work from the two most significant clients in the country: The Bank of Scotland and The Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>To give an idea of just how central this work is, I recall a discussion some years ago with a senior partner in one of Edinburgh's grandest firms. He pointed out that in 1800 their two largest clients were the banks and that this was still the case over two hundred years later. Indeed, the decline of bank business in Edinburgh \u2013 which all the major firms share in \u2014 has been compared by some to Glasgow's loss of heavy industry in the 1950s, or the disturbance of an ecosystem in which surveyors, lawyers, accountants and even sandwich shops have traditionally lived and thrived. Of course both banks are still very much present in the Scottish market, it's just that the transaction work which they consistently provided may not return on anything like the scale it once was.</p> <p>Despite these changes, however, there is a great deal for lawyers to be optimistic about: the market has dynamism and Edinburgh is growing again as an eminent financial centre with secure funds under management; it's attracting headquarters for banks such as Virgin Money, Tesco and Green Investment; the city has over 700 established financial services firms; it's building a significant reputation for technology start-ups with IPO ambitions; there's oil and gas work and development; and it's still one of the top places in the world to live, work and study.</p> <p>But the thing which is most interesting in the industry at the moment is the rapid trend of mergers between Scots and English firms. The most prominent link up earlier this year was between McGrigors, one of Scotland's lead firms, and Pinsent Masons. Others have followed: <a href=\"http://www.dwf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">DWF</a> and Biggart Baillie, <a href=\"http://www.shoosmiths.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Shoosmiths</a> and <a href=\"http://www.achws.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Archibald, Campbell &amp; Harley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dacbeachcroft.com/\" title=\"\">DAC Beachcroft</a> and Andersons. A number of other firms have featured in the rumour mill. The trend is a very significant one for a jurisdiction which has always been fiery about its independence: equally, however, its very independence from the rest of the UK legal sector has perhaps led Scots firms and their lawyers to underplay their hand on a wider stage.</p> <p>Why are these mergers happening, and what are the incentives on both sides?</p> <p>From the Scottish perspective, a link up with a strong London or regional player gives the strength and support of a larger firm in these tough economic times \u2014 for even the biggest in Scotland are small when compared to the likes of the magic circle firms. Many clients will have interests across the border, and it makes sense in those circumstances for the same firm to be able to offer a joined up service. For lawyers in Scottish firms, a link up with a global practice brings the potential to work and travel far beyond the jurisdiction's traditional boundaries.</p> <p>From the opposite perspective, merger with a Scots firm is likely to bring in a high quality team of lawyers with an established share in some very lucrative markets including, for example, oil and gas work. As an added bonus, for those working on high value London deals there will suddenly be the availability of a skilled team of commercial lawyers working out of Edinburgh, Glasgow or Aberdeen, who would then be in a position to share the workload at a competitive rate.</p> <p>Overall, the trend of cross border mergers meets a number of needs on both sides, as well as being a timely reminder that despite obvious differences (such as land law) there is much which is shared across the two jurisdictions. After all, the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1707/7/contents\" title=\"\">Act of Union</a> in 1707 gave Scots the commercial freedom to reap the benefits of England's trade networks, whose doors had until then been closed to them; and it gave England the talent, drive and imagination of some of Scotland's best people. The combined strength from working together across the border is greater than the sum of the separate parts.</p>",

But the move seemed to mark a significant moment in the fight for control of southern Aleppo, which had raged for more than two weeks, claiming several hundred casualties.</p> <p>In Damascus, meanwhile, the FSA announced the defection of Muheddine Musalmani, President Assad's protocol chief. But a state TV channel said he would issue a statement denying the claim.</p> <p>Last week, Assad's prime minister, Riyad Hijab, a veteran Ba'ath party member, became the most senior Syrian political figure yet to defect, appearing in Jordan on Wednesday. Hijab's replacement was named on Thursday as Wael al-Halqi, formerly the health minister.</p> <p>Iran \u2013 a close ally of Syria \u2013 called for \"serious and inclusive\" talks between Assad's government and the opposition as it hosted a conference for 29 countries that it said had \"realistic\" views on the escalating crisis. None of the participating countries has called on Assad to quit or backed opposition groups. Only Iraq, Pakistan and Zimbabwe sent their foreign ministers.</p> <p>Fighting was reported on Thursday in the Damascus area, Hama and Deraa. Shelling also intensified in other parts of Aleppo which had notionally been held by the FSA since it secured its foothold in Salahedin in late July.</p> <p>The regime push had been widely expected earlier this week and rebels had vowed to defend their ground. However, commanders said the intensity of the shelling meant their fighters now had too few opportunities to take cover.</p> <p>\"They were shelling the buildings at the frontline all night,\" said Major Abu Furad, who led one of the main units in Salahedin, Katibat al-Ansar. \"The buildings were falling in front of us. It was impossible to stay there.\"</p> <p>The rebel group had been occupying an area known as street 15, which faced a regime force around 200 metres away. Both sides had traded small arms fire for the past fortnight, but neither had advanced beyond their positions. \"We withdrew to street 10, which [runs parallel] behind street 15, 150 metres back,\" he said. \"But the regime was shelling that street too. It was relentless and no one could stay behind. They have started using bigger bombs from planes. They were far bigger than the shells from the tanks.\"</p> <p>The FSA leadership in Aleppo said it was now redeploying its forces to other key areas of the city. It claimed its ousting from Salahedin had not damaged morale and maintained that the regime was continuing to hold back its ground forces because it fears many would defect if they were ordered to enter the city.</p> <p>\"That's what the defectors are telling us,\" said Sheikh Tawfik Abu Sleiman, leader of one of the Aleppo brigades. \"They would shed their uniforms and run away.\"</p> <p>Shelling intensified throughout Thursday in other areas of Aleppo that had previously seen limited fighting. The FSA said it was responding by launching attacks in the centre of the city, where regime troops and the loyalist shabiha militia were stationed to defend key state institutions.</p> <p>The FSA in Aleppo seemed to be united in a plea for an internationally enforced no-fly zone, which would ground the Syrian air force jets now playing an increasing role in the campaign.</p> <p>\"That's all we need,\" said Abu Hanefa. \"No guns, no armies, just the ability to get these things out of the sky. They are killing us.\" Another rebel leader, who had left Salahedin, said: \"Even the bravest among us had to acknowledge that these jets are something that we cannot fight. It is one thing being outgunned by tanks, but planes are creating a very, very difficult situation.\"</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>The Beijing silver medallist in the 10km marathon swim, Keri-Anne Payne, was today unable to go one better for Great Britain and finished just outside the medals at the Serpentine. The 24-year old Stockport swimmer, born in South Africa, went into the race as the reigning world champion from 2009 and 2011 but finished fourth in a tight finish as she closed in on bronze in what she described as a \"violent\" race.

There was quite a lot of fighting. I don't think any of it was intentional. I've never really been in the pack before so perhaps its like that all the time. For me it felt a little bit violent, a little bit argy bargy. It took a lot of energy out of me and that's why I like to get out front.\"</p> <p>The race took place in still, hot conditions with barely a ripple on the surface of the sun-drenched Serpentine and Payne was unable to dominate the race as she did in Beijing in 2008 when she led until the last 50m only to be overhauled agonisingly by her Russian rival, Larisa Ilchenko.</p> <p>She hit the front from the start, but for the second half of the race she was tucked into fourth and fifth position in a leading group behind Risztov who swam in the pool in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, the European open water champion Grimaldi, Anderson and Angela Maurer from Germany.</p> <p>As Risztov came down the back straight in front of 10- deep crowds past the Serpentine swimming clubhouse, Risztov led by several lengths ahead of a tight pack of four chasing two medals. The roar from the crowd swept across the water's service as they headed for the final turn and the pack tried to close the gap leaving Payne hanging on at the back. She moved up to fourth but could not catch Grimaldi.</p> <p>Payne has swum before in far worse conditions. Competing in the Xin Jinhe river in Shantou, China, she contended with dead dogs and horses. The Royal Park had installed aeration equipment and reed beds to oxygenate the water and keep the algae at bay and the wildlife consisted of Egyptian geese and mute swans, none dead.</p> <p>Payne's fourth place will provide little relief to the British swimming team which has underachieved in the pool at London 2012 winning only two bronzes, both for Rebecca Adlington, and one silver for the Scot, Michael Jamieson.</p> <p>Adlington, Liam Tancock and Elizabeth Simmonds were among more than a dozen members of the team who came to cheer Payne on. They included David Carry, whom Payne will marry on 15 September. He sat in the stands and talked to the prime minister, David Cameron, attending yet another event.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people who did not need tickets lined the banks of the Serpentine to watch the swimmers on their steady progression.</p> <p>More than 70 of Payne's family and friends, including her childhood swimming coach, were in the stands.</p> <p>The supporting party all wore \"Keep calm and Keri-Anne\" t-shirts emblazoned with a picture of the South Africa-born swimmer hauling herself out of the water, victorious in an earlier race.</p> <p>\"With the family atmosphere around here and the sun shining it is almost like she's a kid again back in South Africa,\" said Carry. Di Williamson, her first swimming coach, had flown in from Johannesburg for the race.</p> <p>After a huge dive and a long underwater glide which gave Payne an immediate advantage, she hit the front to plough through the unbroken still water. Risztov tucked in by her hip, the position that has been identified as the most efficient to achieve the draft effect.</p> <p>At the end of the first lap Risztov, Melissa Gorman from Australia, Payne and Anderson led the field and the group stayed together throughout the first three laps, crossing the halfway mark in an hour with Grimaldi joining the group and Payne in fourth.</p> <p>The marathon swim is not just about endurance. Cunning and aggression is required too in the often tight pack. The organisers check the competitors' finger nails and toenails are trimmed before they dive in.</p> <p>The discipline is the equivalent of doing 200 lengths of a 50m pool and burns around 3500 calories, so there are feeding stations on the course which are one of the more eccentric sights of the London 2012 games. Coaches hold out drinks and energy gels on poles of up to five metres which are identified with the national flag. As the coaches try and find their swimmer in the pack and the swimmer flips onto their back to swallow the sustenance it resembles a game from It's a Knockout, only without Stuart Hall's giggling commentary. Impeding or swimming over rivals is punishable by a yellow card from the race referee.</p> <p>By the end of the fourth lap Payne was in fifth place and just 4.4 seconds off the leader Risztov, but it was not the front-running position Payne had planned to take.</p> <p>The race was proving gruelling and the South Africa swimmer Jessica Roux gave up and was rescued by a jet-ski.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever the outcome of today's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/08/olympics-2012-boxing-boxing\">flyweight final</a>, Nicola Adams has already won the first fight in the battle to have women's boxing accepted as a worthy Olympic sport.</p> <p>Back in 2009, when it was announced that more than 100 years after women's boxing first featured as a demonstration sport at the 1908 Olympics it would finally be accepted as an Olympic sport, neither the sport's male proponents nor the press were particularly impressed. Amir Khan, one of Britain's best-known boxing Olympians who won silver at the Athens Games in 2004, was not in favour.</p> <p>\"Deep down I think women shouldn't fight,\" he said at the time. \"That's my opinion. When you get hit it can be very painful. Women can get knocked out.\" But he didn't appear to be too concerned on Wednesday as he sat smiling alongside prime minister David Cameron in a deafeningly loud Excel centre, to witness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/08/nicola-adams-mary-kom-london-2012\">Nicola Adams box her way to a place in the flyweight final</a> and Olympic history. After beating <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/19136965\">India's five-time world champion Mary Kom</a>, the boxer beamed for the cameras. \"To reach an Olympic final, I've dreamt of this since I was 12 years old,\" said the 29-year-old from Leeds.</p> <p>Back then, it was a far-fetched dream. The women's sport was completely banned in the UK until 1996, with the <a href=\"http://www.bbbofc.com/\">British Boxing Board of Control</a> (BBBC) denying women a licence to fight until 1998 on the grounds that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/218581.stm\">premenstrual syndrome made them too unstable to box</a>. Even after being given the green light by the <a href=\"http://www.abae.co.uk/aba/\">Amateur Boxing Association of England</a>, getting a competitive fight was difficult and even finding a gym to train in could be a struggle, with girls regularly turned away because of a lack of \"facilities\".</p> <p>But if this Olympics has been a triumph for women's sporting achievement in general, it has been a defining moment for boxing in particular - the Games when women demonstrated that they could not only complete in a sport seen as quintessentially male, but do it with real class. Adams - with her trademark copy of the Ali shuffle employed between lightning-quick combinations - looks completely at home in the ring. Alongside Ireland's Katie Taylor, the four-times world champion whose travelling supporters have made the Excel shake, the women have silenced doubters with convincing displays of skillful and entertaining boxing. </p> <p>Although 21-year-old British middleweight Savannah Marshall, the reigning world champion, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19147880\">went out in a shock defeat in the quarter-finals</a> and the superior skills of Taylor <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19147877\">proved too much for lightweight Natasha Jonas</a>, the British women boxers have more than proved their right to compete at the highest level. \"I hope I have shown what is possible for women's boxing, that's what it is all about at the top level,\" said Jonas after her fight with Taylor, who will now fight to take home gold in the lightweight final. </p> <p>\"When you see women's boxing at the highest level and that kind of performance, how can you argue that women aren't just as good as the men?\"</p> <p>Perhaps the most surprising things about the women's boxing in these Games is how little <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/17/london-2012-nicola-adams-olympic-stars\">the struggle to get here</a> is referenced. Back in 1997 Frank Maloney, the manager of the former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, described a fight between two girls exercising their new-won right to box in 1997 as a \"freak show\".</p> <p>Now Lewis himself seems cheerfully flummoxed at the quality of the women boxers on show. \"Wow, the girls were unbelievable at ExCeL on Monday,\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19160069\">he wrote in his BBC blog</a>, reserving his greatest praise for Taylor - a masterful boxer, who has perhaps done more than anyone to raise the profile of women's boxing and bring it to the Olympics. \"The way she throws punches and the aggression she throws them with, you can tell she's got the killer instinct,\" he wrote. \"I think the guys should be watching their backs, she could beat a lot of them out there.\"</p> <p>The coverage of the women's boxing has been remarkable. Newspapers that usually dedicate meagre inches to women's sport - and still less to women's boxing - have put Adams on the front cover. Bastions of traditional values <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/boxing/9459940/London-2012-Olympics-pioneering-pugilists-win-hearts-and-minds-in-boxing-ring-after-long-struggle-for-acceptance.html\">such as the Telegraph</a> have hailed the tournament as \"the purest distillation of the Olympic spirit - the pursuit of sport for sport's sake\".</p> <p>And the Sun - a newspaper that still carries a daily picture of a near-naked woman - <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/olympics/4472842/Emmeline-Pankhurst-would-have-been-proud-of-Natasha-Jonas-Probably.html\">declared</a>, after Natasha Jonas made history by becoming the first British female boxer to fight in an Olympics, that \"Emmeline Pankhurst would have been proud.\"</p> <p>As Adams steps into the ring today for the first women's boxing final in Olympic history, she will be carrying the hopes of a nation desperate for her to win gold and fulfill her childhood dream, as well as the hopes of lots of young girls.</p>",
  "<p>Most of Mitt Romney's newest Twitter followers are fake, according to an investigation of bogus social media accounts.</p> <p>A pay-for-follower service most likely drove the presumptive Republican nominee's recent and dramatic spike in online followers, <a href=\"http://www.barracudalabs.com/wordpress/?p=2989\">concluded Baccardua Labs</a>, a digital security company.</p> <p>The widely reported surge in tens of thousands of new followers for <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mittromney\">@mittromney</a> from 21 July \u2013 which provoked commentary and suspicion \u2013 appeared to have been purchased from a dealer, it said: \"We believe most of these recent followers of Romney are not from a general Twitter population but most likely from a paid Twitter follower service.\"</p> <p>The analysis, part of a wider investigation into what the report called the underground Twitter economy, found telltale signals that about a quarter of the new followers were less than three weeks old and had not tweeted. Some 80% were less than three-months-old.</p> <p>The report's author, Jason Ding, said there was no way of identifying whether it was the work of the Romney campaign, a Romney supporter or an opponent out to discredit him.</p> <p>\"Romney's newest followers could have been paid for by himself, his associates or by his opponents.

  "<p>I'm not sure if my mother, thrilled when I decided to study law, ever anticipated that this would involve me spending weeks in court live-tweeting about fisting and how best to stick metal rods down one's penis. But it's testament only to how extraordinary it is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/08/boris-johnson-aide-extreme-pornography-cleared?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Simon Walsh's case at Kingston crown court</a> ever reached this stage that I found myself doing exactly this.</p> <p>I was alerted to Simon's case in July this year. Walsh was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) with five counts of possessing extreme pornographic images under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63\" title=\"\">Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008</a>. Police officers raided his city-centre flat and took all his electronic equipment on the suspicion that he was in possession of an indecent image of a child. No illegal material was found on any of the equipment, but in an online email account six images were recovered. Five of these were retrieved from his \"sent\" folder, and one from his inbox. Simon was subsequently charged with five counts of possessing \"extreme pornography\", and one count of possessing what was purported to be an indecent image of a child. The final image was sent to him unsolicited, and he had no recollection of ever viewing it. It was also the defence's case that the last image was not of a child but an adult male.</p> <p>\"Extreme pornography\", <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/extreme_pornography/\" title=\"\">according to the act</a>, covers images of any number of sexual activities \"likely to cause serious injury to the breasts, anus and genitals\". The judge in this case ruled that he considered \"serious injury\" to relate to \"physically, mentally or morally harmful\". As Walsh, a barrister himself, remarked over the weekend: \"How on Earth can one's genitals be morally harmed?\"</p> <p>The CPS, however, seemed ruthless in their pursuit of a conviction. I'm certainly no prude, but in the process of the trial I learnt more about the anatomy of the anus and penis than I have ever felt necessary. Did you know the difference between an anus and rectum, or that we have not one but two sphincters? Or that urologists occasionally have cause to extract ballpoint pens from people's penises? Neither did I. I never thought I would witness a barrister for the CPS refer so many times to \"Nasty Kink Pigs\" (a sex contacts site) in legal argument with apparent relish, nor an expert witness utter the immortal words: \"It may take some time for someone to take a whole arm into their rectum.\" I didn't think I would ever see a consultant urologist be asked to stand in a witness box and demonstrate how to hold a penis using a ballpoint pen casing. All these details were supposedly essential to the CPS's case, attempting to prove that the images showed adults causing \"serious injury\" to each other's genitals and anuses and that Walsh had a keen interest in viewing pornography of this kind.</p> <p>Nonetheless, interrogating a defendant about their most intimate and private sexual fantasies and activities is exactly what Section 63 permits a prosecuting barrister to do. The same barrister reminded the jury in his closing speech that this is not a Victorian law, but came into force as late as 2008. Yet a jury is still obliged to come to a decision as to whether or not pornographic images are \"grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character\". As the judge presiding over the case said in his directions to the jury: \"I don't pretend for a moment that these parts of the legislation are easily understandable\".</p> <p>It becomes difficult to imagine, after Simon Walsh's landmark acquittal on all counts, under what circumstances charges relating to possession of extreme pornography may be brought to the crown court again, but it seems the CPS has a rather prurient interest in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/aug/08/extreme-porn-trial-simon-walsh\" title=\"\">bringing other people's private sex lives to light</a> and persecuting them for it.</p> <p>At one point in the trial, the prosecuting barrister asked Mr Datta, a colorectal surgeon at Guy's and Thomas's NHS Trust: \"Can you tell us what a douche is?\" Perhaps the CPS might be able to answer that question.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Shooting your own son<br></strong></h2> <p>After seeing Rob Drummond's wonderfully entertaining but emotionally devastating <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/05/bullet-catch-edinburgh-festival-review\">Bullet Catch</a> at the Traverse, I asked Jackie Wylie of Glasgow's The Arches \u2013 where the piece originated \u2013 if the magician's assistant (always a member of the audience, not a plant) had ever refused to shoot Drummond, at the show's climax. I was interested, because while I was watching I wondered whether I would be able to bring myself to do it. \"Not so far,\" she replied. But then at Tuesday night's performance it happened. When it came to the crucial moment, the girl plucked from the audience wouldn't, or couldn't, pull the trigger. But all was not lost: Drummond's mum was in the audience, and when a son needs a helping hand a mum can't refuse, can she? Actually she, too, faltered \u2013 leaving the task to one of Drummond's friends, who stepped into the breach. If anything, the story makes me even more fond of the show, which unlike so much theatre is a piece that revels in its genuine liveness, which entertains the genuine possibility that things may not pan out quite as rehearsed. </p> <h2><strong>Re-forestation</strong></h2> <p>I feel a little sad when I walk along Bristo Place past the site where the wonderful Forest Cafe used to be and which was the home to the remarkable <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/aug/07/edinburghfestival.forestfringe\">Forest fringe</a>, run by Deborah Pearson and Andy Field. Forest fringe is hoping to be back at the fringe next year in its full glory, but it has a presence here this year with a project called <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/paper-stages-edinburgh-2012/\">Paper Stages</a> that will be launched at the new <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/hunt-darton-cafe?day=25-08-2012&amp;performance=1%3A19183 \">Hunt and Darton Caf\u00e9</a> on Saturday. One of the people behind the much-missed Forest Cafe was rising poet Ryan Van Winkle. He can be found at <a href=\"http:// www.summerhall.co.uk\">Summerhall</a> with Red, Like Our Room Used to Feel, an intimate 20-minute poetry/installation experience.</p> <h2><strong>Cute rules?</strong></h2> <p>I ran into a couple of theatre programmers yesterday, who were trawling the fringe looking for shows. One remarked that so far she had found little for her because so much was \"white and middle-class\", and the other said that she was drowning in cuteness. I know how she feels. Whimsy and charm are a significant part of the toolbox of many young theatremakers here: there's even a show at the Traverse, Mess, that succeeds in making anorexia all pink and fluffy. <a href=\"http://hannahsilva.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/preamble-to-writing-about-two-shows-at-summerhall-edinburgh-fringe/\">Check out this interesting read by Hannah Silva on the subject.</a> I wonder whether economics play a part: audiences are often more willing to be enchanted than they are to be challenged by shows such as Morning at the Traverse or <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk/2012/the-shit-la-merda/\">The Shit</a> at Summerhall \u2013 a piece so literally and metaphorically naked, raw and angry that you leave the theatre feeling as if you've had all your skin scraped off. </p> <h2><strong>Word of mouth</strong></h2> <p>Shows I haven't seen myself but which I'm hearing good things about: Perle (from Verity Bargate winner <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/32332/thomas-eccleshare-wins-verity-bargate-award\">Tom Eccleshare</a>) at Assembly Roxy, Bottleneck at Pleasance Courtyard, Stellar Quines' The List at Summerhall, The Boat Factory at Hill Street, One Hour Only and Bitch Boxer at Underbelly (I'm catching both today) and Botallack O'Clock and The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs, both at Gilded Balloon.

  "<p>Jaguar Land Rover has won gold for British exporters by reporting a 45% boom in second-quarter profits to well over \u00a3500m, driven by soaring demand from China for the new Range Rover Evoque.</p> <p>The Coventry-based company, now under the control of Tata Motors of India, saw a 91% increase in overall sales from the luxury-car-hungry Chinese market year on year.</p> <p>More than 80% of the vehicles produced at three UK plants are being shipped abroad, increasingly to countries such as China, Brazil and Russia.</p> <p>\"China is strong, especially strong for the luxury market,\" said Ralf Speth, the chief executive of JLR. \"We have a very low market share in China \u2026 therefore we are sure we can continue this growth.\"</p> <p>Industry experts say the Range Rover Evoque has been particularly cleverly marketed \u2013 boosted by a special edition designed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/apr/23/victoria-beckham-designs-range-rover\" title=\"Guardian: Posh car for sale, one stylish owner, contact Victoria Beckham \">collaboration with Victoria Beckham</a> \u2013 but they believe the whole company is thriving on heavy investment, strong product lines and good management.</p> <p>The strong financial performance was announced on the day the Office for National Statistics revealed that in June Britain's trade deficit had ballooned to its highest level since modern records began following a sharp drop in exports.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, JLR sales rose 34% to 83,452 vehicles, including nearly 72,000 Land Rovers \u2013 but fewer than 12,000 Jaguar saloon cars \u2013 in the three months to 30 June.</p> <p>Revenues for the quarter hit \u00a33.6bn, an increase of 35%, while operating margins stood at 14.5% and an operating profit of \u00a3527m in the quarter \u2013 an increase of 45.6% \u2013 was recorded.</p> <p>\"Continued strong revenue and operating profit performance were supported by demand for new products, improved market mix and a favourable exchange rate environment,\" said the company.</p> <p>JLR has declared a first dividend of \u00a3150m, which went to Tata Motors, whose wider business was hit by a slowdown in its home market of India and a depreciation of the rupee. The wider group reported a consolidated profit, before tax, up 34% but net income rose only 12%.</p> <p>Tata bought Jaguar Land Rover from the Ford Motor Company in 2008 for about \u00a31.5bn and its subsequent success after a long period of difficulty means 23,000 staff are employed in Britain. About 8,000 have been taken on in the past 24 months alone and the business has recently announced plans to build a new engine plant in south Staffordshire that could take on a further 750 workers. JLR has also decided to build a new Jaguar F-type at the Castle Bromwich facility in Birmingham.</p> <p>Professor Baback Yazdani, the dean of Nottingham Business School and a car industry expert, said JLR had \"bounced back remarkably\" over recent years by positioning itself for overseas market growth in luxury brands.</p> <p>\"This is about foreign ownership but local management. Just like the Olympics, if you want to be a champion you have to put in relentless hard work as well as inspired leadership.</p> <p>\"Tata has put in long-term investment but given the responsibility to JLR to deliver its own destiny.\"</p> <p>JLR is just one of a number of automobile success stories in Britain with Toyota, Nissan and the BMW-owned Mini business also performing strongly at a time when car sales in Europe and the US are static.</p> <p>Toyota said late last year that up to \u00a3100m would be invested and 1,500 jobs created with the production of a new hatchback model at the group's Burnaston plant in Derbyshire. This month the Japanese company announced that first-quarter profits had almost quadrupled, although this was exaggerated by difficulties last year owing to the tsunami which forced it to halt production.</p> <p>Meanwhile, those more exposed to volume car markets in the US and Europe such as General Motors of Detroit, which also controls the Vauxhall brand, saw a fall in quarterly profits in the three months to June. In 2009 the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and received a $50bn bailout from the American government.</p> <h2>VW weathers crisis while subsidiary Seat amasses losses</h2> <p>As it strives to become the world's most profitable automotive group, the last thing Volkswagen needs is a perpetually loss-making subsidiary. Seat, its Spanish car division, is exactly that, which is why VW has ambitious plans for the carmaker outside western Europe.</p> <p>Unlike its competitors, VW has weathered Europe's debt crisis, reporting higher profits and record deliveries while adding production capacity in expanding Chinese and Russian markets. Seat, meanwhile, has amassed \u00a41bn (\u00a3786m) of losses since 2008 and has made a profit in only one of the last 10 years, a dismal performance that VW seems committed to fix.</p> <p>Battered by the slump in austerity-hit Spain, Seat is the only brand among VW's five main car nameplates to be stuck in the red, VW's recent quarterly results showed. \"Seat is the undisputed black sheep in the VW family,\" said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, director of the Centre for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. \"It would be economically more sensible to close it down and use its facilities for other group brands.\"</p> <p>VW wants Seat to become less reliant on Spain and instead seize potential in China and Russia.</p> <p>The brand plans to open 15 showrooms in major Chinese cities including Chengdu, Nanjing and Shenzen by the end of the year, exploiting growing demand from young buyers for sporty compacts. The average Seat buyer is 34, giving it the youngest customer profile in the VW group.</p>",
  "<p>For young people, a criminal record is synonymous with a future without hope. Nowhere is this reality born out more clearly than the case of Bob Ashford, the former director of strategy at the Youth Justice Board, who has had to stand down as Labour's police and crime commissioner candidate for Avon and Somerset because of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/08/bob-ashford-labour-police-commissioner\" title=\"\">minor offence committed 46 years ago</a>. He was 13 at the time and was fined \u00a32 and 10 shillings.</p> <p>Our rehabilitation system is based on a complete misunderstanding \u2013 it manages risk through a criminal record check, a list of everything that someone has done wrong, and doesn't take into account the achievements they have made since their offence. Employers, like most of the public, are educated about crime by the media. They've been subjected to self-righteous outrage without knowing about the factors that lead to the offence in the first place, or the hard work that has gone into overcoming them. And when you put the facts in their hands, employers can use them to discriminate, excluding people with a record from employment.</p> <p>Offenders have already often been punished by incarceration; by stigmatising them, society continues to punish them for the rest of their life in slow instalments. Many ex-offenders would slip easily into a working life, posing little risk to employers or the public. Why are they not allowed to get on with their lives?</p> <p>Teenagers know that if they are 15 and have a criminal conviction, they are bottom of the employment pool. The number one concern of young people coming into contact with the criminal justice system is the criminal records check. This leaves them without hope. Instead of managing and avoiding risk, the system does the opposite. It creates the ground from which extreme behaviour is cultivated.</p> <p>Despite my many achievements in later life, I will always be labelled \"ex-offender\". The only way I could get a job was to set up my own business, but that's not an option for everyone.</p> <p>Navigating the path to successful living is the best qualification for working with people currently caught up in the criminal justice system. Yet, the public sector has a terrible record of employing ex-offenders. They are excluded from these positions because we live in a world in which politicians are too scared of the public. Bob Ashford, in <a href=\"http://bobashford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">his statement</a> explaining his decision to step down as a PCC candidate, says:</p> <blockquote> \"I am setting out in detail my recollection of the offences I committed and which have now barred myself from standing to illustrate the pressures and injustices that children and young people can face in their neighbourhoods and criminal justice system and the continuing damage of offences and criminal records committed by children and young people being carried into their adult lives.\" </blockquote> <p>That's why I founded the charity <a href=\"http://www.uservoice.org/\" title=\"\">User Voice</a>, which is led and run by the very young people Ashford refers to. Politicians from all parties should be held to account for discriminating against us, for managing risk in such a perverse way, and for ultimately failing society by not employing the real experts \u2013 youth offenders \u2013 in the youth justice system to help cut crime.</p>",
  "<p>Climate change is real, it exhibits the hand of man, and it is the cause of global devastation. Despite the obvious need for immediate action, the human race is losing the race against time. Here's a different approach for us to become resilient, kickstart growth, and accelerate the pace of progress toward sustainable development.</p> <p>Last week Nasa scientist <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/05/us/climate-change/index.html?iref=allsearch\" title=\"\">James Hansen linked climate change to extreme weather</a>. His findings are topical, considering the ongoing widespread US drought, massive power outage in India, and historic flooding in China. Whether you believe the science behind climate change or not, these dreadful events rise above the sceptic's eye.</p> <p>Despite climate change's continuing path of devastation, the world is still struggling to mount an effective response. Not that the global effort is not lacking. Rio+20 was the latest in a recurring string of international meetings to combat climate change and promote sustainable development. Prominent companies are investing significant amounts to achieve their greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments. And many individual citizens are acting voluntarily to reduce their environmental footprints.</p> <p>But there are numerous, well-known roadblocks to an effective response. Let's start with the word \"voluntarily\". Action to mitigate the hand of man in climate change has for the most part been voluntary. Yes, the European Union has put its emissions trading scheme in place. And yes, Australia has set up its own carbon trading market. But without a binding global policy on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global action remains voluntary. As we all know, there are timescale limits to voluntary actions.</p> <p>The global effort to achieve a binding policy that transforms efforts from voluntary to \"in compliance\" is hamstrung by asymmetric competitive disadvantage. Outside of huge, near-selfless gesture, why would developed countries willingly limit their companies' GHG emissions (therefore necessitating significant investment and potentially disruptive change) while developing countries would not be under similar conditions?</p> <p>What makes climate change such a frustrating challenge is not only its scale but also its myriad stresses and risks. The challenge effects everyone, albeit unequally. Those living in particularly sensitive environments are at greater risk of suffering from climate change's effects. And that's before we discuss financial and technological resources. Climate change is a collection of stresses and risks. Stresses, such as the melting of the polar ice cap, and risks, such as the subsequent potential flooding of urban centres residing on shorelines, have been thoroughly dissected elsewhere. Suffice to say there is no single climate change solution.</p> <p>Cross-sector collaboration provides the path to our best chance to navigate out of our collective mess. To see why and how, consider the <a href=\"http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/\" title=\"\">Consumer Goods Forum</a>. The forum brings together over 400 retailers, manufacturers, and NGOs from 70 countries. The member companies have <a href=\"http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/pfiles/press_release/Press_Release_2012/2012-06-20-CGF-Us-Gov-deforestation.pdf,\" title=\"\">combined sales of $3.1 trillion and employ nearly 10 million people</a>. Eighteen months ago the forum's members collectively set a binding agreement to help achieve net zero deforestation by 2020 by employing the power of their supply chains. Deforestation is meaningful to the forum's companies because they rely on forestry for everything from palm oil, to soy, beef, paper and board materials for their products.</p> <p>This agreement, and subsequent action, is noteworthy because deforestation accounts for nearly 17% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed the agreement possesses so much kinetic energy that in June 2012 the US government agreed to join the forum's effort to tackle deforestation.</p> <p>Cross-sector collaborations are most effective when targeting issues of collective enlightened self-interest. Water to a beverage company. Food to a food company. Energy to an energy services company. All three of these are clearly sustainable development issues. They have become, by company choice, the foundations of enterprise strategies.</p> <p>To be clear, climate change itself falls within everyone's sphere of interest. But where do we truly begin? How does a participant in a sector, or an entire sector for that matter, move the needle on climate change? And how can we avoid disappointment if we expect every participant in our global economy to act voluntarily in our collective best interests?</p> <p>As the Consumer Goods Forum shows, there is appetite among the private, public, and civil sectors to collaborate on meaningful issues. Indeed initial conclusions from my study of ongoing cross-sector collaborative efforts reveals clues that could help answer to the challenges we face:</p> <h2>Change the object of our global pursuit from sustainability to resilience</h2> <p>Private, public, and social sectors must participate collaboratively if a set of solutions is to be found and put in place. Above all else, inaction within each sector is a prescription for obsolescence across all sectors.</p> <p>\"Sustainability\" is perceived to be a loaded term, more often associated with stewardship than prosperous development. Our collective reliance on achieving a state of sustainability is leading to inaction, endless debate, and disagreement. Once and for all, let's move beyond sustainability as synonymous with altruism, with \"do goodedness\", and with liberal agendas. Instead let's view action, and not merely debate, as synonymous with raising our collective resilience today while inoculating our global environment against the hand of man over time.</p> <h2>Work with organisations across sectors to solve common vexing issues </h2> <p>The key is to collaboratively focus on solutions to smaller, though no less significant, sustainable development issues:</p> <p>\u2022 Without water, beverage, food, and energy companies perish quickly</p> <p>\u2022 Without water, we perish quickly too</p> <p>\u2022 Without energy, our lives are irrevocably disrupted. The same holds true for all companies</p> <p>\u2022 Without food, we perish, though slightly less quickly thanwithout water. Farmers and food companies in particular perish quickly without food</p> <p>Water, energy, food \u2013 these three issues are the essential holy trinity of environmental sustainability. They are maddeningly intertwined and their effect reaches everyone \u2013 private, public, and social sectors alike. Because everyone is affected by each of these issues, and because they are so intertwined, everyone needs to be at the table. No one entity, no matter how large, can save us from ourselves.</p> <h2>Adopt an 'action <em>is</em> our policy' approach </h2> <p>The private and social sectors must stop waiting for government regulation in order to act. This is not earth shattering. But to this point the sustainable development action has been less than unanimous. Certain companies within the private sector are beginning to realise that they no longer control their own destiny. Now they can only influence their own destiny. Because, above all else, every company relies on natural resources and willing human labour for products and services. Without either, what do you have?</p> <p>Collective action on environmental and social issues can kickstart growth. Solutions to the challenges discussed above will rely upon all else enlightened self-interests, innovation, and inclusivity. History has shown how innovation, when properly funded and scaled, lead to growth. Inclusivity in turn increases the likelihood of adoption of innovative solutions to frustrating problems. But it's enlightened self-interest that will enable the scale of innovation and extend our reach to include as many constituents as possible.</p> <p>As the Consumer Goods Forum example suggests, multinational companies can successfully lead cross-sector efforts to address vexing climate change problems. Their interests cross the borders of developed and developing countries alike, so their actions, when brought to life throughout their global operations, are not beholden to the asymmetric competitive disadvantage problem. Indeed companies including Coca-Cola, Unilever, and GE are actively embracing open innovation to find, fund, and scale ideas that build the foundation to solutions in the water, food, and energy fields. Coca-Cola is working with Dean Kaman, the Segway inventor, to refine and scale a device that can turn the dirtiest of water into the cleanest drinking water. Unilever is working with NGOs and other organisations to collect and bring best thinking and practices to 500,000 smallholder farmers worldwide. And GE's Ecomagination challenge is both gathering ideas for new energy system technologies, but also using the company's global footprint to refine, scale, and accelerate entrepreneurs' ideas into significant revenue streams for all involved.</p> <p>For those sceptics of the private sector, remember this: these companies understand that without water, food, and/or energy, they too will cease to exist.</p> <p>We're all in the same boat. It's time to accept this and get on with escaping our mess by rowing in the same direction. Resilience, growth, and sustainable development remain within our reach. We just need to work together to grab these brass rings.</p> <p><em>Eric Lowitt is the author of The Future of Value and a forthcoming book, The Collaboration Economy.

Gu and the family employee Zhang Xiaojun did not contest the allegation of premeditated murder, said Tang Yigan, vice-president and spokesman of the Hefei intermediate people's court. \"Gu Kailai is the main culprit and Zhang is the accomplice,\" he added.</p> <p>The judgment will be delivered at an unspecified future date, Tang said in his brief statement to reporters after the hearing closed, which included the details of the case.</p> <p>Bo, once tipped for promotion in the 10-yearly change of party leadership approaching this autumn, was ousted as party secretary of Chongqing in March. His downfall, and the extraordinary news of his wife's arrest on suspicion of murder, was the biggest upheaval in Chinese politics for 20 years.</p> <p>Gu's trial is so sensitive it was not even mentioned on China's flagship evening news programme. But in a short clip carried on the state broadcaster's website, Gu was shown arriving at the courtroom wearing a black suit and white shirt, flanked by two female police officers.</p> <p>Zhang, her co-accused, wore a white polo shirt and dark trousers as he walked between two male officers.</p> <p>The clip said four Chongqing police officers had been charged last week with covering up the murder of Heywood by Gu to prevent her from having to face criminal responsibility. They will stand trial in the same court in Hefei on Friday.</p> <p>The official statement released on Thursday did not explain why Gu's lawyer, Jiang Min, had said the 41-year-old Briton should bear responsibility for his murder. But officials said Gu had killed him in the belief that he posed a threat to her son and alluded to a conflict over money.</p> <p>Prosecutors alleged that Gu arranged for Zhang to escort Heywood from Beijing to south-western Chongqing on 13 November last year. She met him in his room, number 1605 at the Lucky Holiday hotel, where they drank tea and alcohol together until he was so drunk that he vomited and needed water.</p> <p>She then poured poison that she had prepared earlier, and had been carried by Zhang, into Heywood's mouth.</p> <p>The 41-year-old's family were told he died of excessive drinking. They accepted the conclusion, apparently believing it brought on a heart attack. But friends of the businessman were sceptical, saying he was only a light drinker.</p> <p>Intriguingly, Gu's defence lawyer said she had alerted officials to crimes of other people and that this should be considered a significant contribution and taken into account. No further details were given.</p> <p>When news of her detention first emerged, some thought Bo might also be tried. But no further mention has been made of his case since the initial statement that he was under investigation by party authorities for disciplinary violations.</p> <p>Some also surmised that the decision not to charge Gu with economic crimes, to which she allegedly confessed, was an attempt to shield her husband \u2013 and by extension other leaders and their families \u2013 from unwelcome scrutiny over possible corruption.</p> <p>Defending Gu, Jiang said Gu's ability to control her behaviour was \"weaker than normal people's\" at the time of Heywood's death. But the court noted that she was in good physical condition and emotionally stable during Thursday's hearing.</p> <p>No foreign media were allowed into Gu and Zhang's trial, with officials saying there was no room in the spacious courtroom, although empty seats could be seen in the news footage.</p> <p>Two British diplomats attended in a consular capacity. Relatives and friends of Heywood and the defendants were also present, the statement added.</p> <p>Dozens of plain-clothed officers and scores of uniformed police surrounded the courthouse during the hearing. Two singing protesters who appeared outside the Hefei intermediate people's court in Anhui were dragged away in the pouring rain. \"I don't believe it. This case was decided well in advance,\" said one of them, Hu Jiye, before he was pushed into a car.</p> <p>The lawyer Li Fangping wrote on Sina's Weibo microblog: \"The security of the Hefei intermediate court is definitely number one in the world but whether it can ensure just proceedings is another question.\"</p> <p>Responding to another lawyer's post, the artist and activist Ai Weiwei wrote on Twitter: \"The 'justice' of no justice, no fairness, and no openness to the public. It is sad.\"</p> <p>Relatives of Gu, 53, and Zhang, 33, hired lawyers to represent them, but were then told that the defendants had accepted state-appointed lawyers. But Gu thanked the judge, prosecution and her own lawyers at the end of proceedings and asked that Zhang receive a lighter sentence than hers, a source who witnessed the trial told the Washington Post.</p> <p>\"I committed a crime that brought negative consequences to the party and the country,\" she added, according to the source.</p>",
  "<p>A senior Russian official has implied that Madonna is a moralising \"slut\" after the singer used a Moscow concert to state her support for the jailed feminist punk band Pussy Riot.</p> <p>\"With age, every former s. tries to lecture everyone on morality,\" Dmitry Rogozin, a deputy prime minister, wrote on Twitter late on Wednesday, using the first letter of the Russian word for \"slut\" or \"whore\". \"Especially during overseas tours.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/07/pussy-riot-madonna-concert-plea\" title=\"\">Madonna scrawled \"Pussy Riot\" across her back</a> and performed \"Like a Virgin\" wearing the band's trademark balaclava during a concert in Moscow on Tuesday.

  "<p>As this week's money-laundering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">allegations against Standard Chartered bank show</a>, Iran is feeling the pressure of heightened sanctions and is exploring all options to circumvent them.</p> <p>Though the claims relate to the period 2001-7, since the start of this year co-ordinated sanctions by the EU as well as the US have tightened the noose on Tehran by blocking access to the key financial and insurance markets of Europe. Iran is slowly being excluded from large parts of the global financial system, unable to sell its oil and fast running out of space to store it.</p> <p>Living with sanctions is not new to Iran, nor are many of the methods it has used to evade them. But all its counter-efforts have locked western sanctions enforcement agencies in a game of cat-and-mouse aimed at exposing anyone trying to access the financial system to launder funds or hide transactions.</p> <p>And Iran's tactics are often sophisticated. Over the past year, the regime has launched a diplomatic offensive focused on developing economies, which are desperate for cheap fuel, and it has offered them huge discounts on oil. Some countries have found ways to trade or evade by negotiating barter deals involving grain or consumer goods in exchange for oil.</p> <p>In addition, tankers carrying Iranian oil are alleged to have switched off their automatic identification systems used to track their locations, and Iranian shipping firms are known to have frequently changed the name, owners, and flag state of vessels \u2013 even allegedly to have repainted tankers. The lack of transparency in the shipping industry makes detection of offenders more difficult, and Iran has historically been successful in staying ahead of US and European efforts to track and blacklist them.</p> <p>Iranian corporations, directed by their government, have long used offshore companies, which have limited or no ownership disclosure requirements, to trade or try to enter the financial system. In 2010, with the help of US pressure group <a href=\"http://www.iranwatch.org/\" title=\"\">Iran Watch</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/world/middleeast/08sanctions.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">New York Times exposed </a>a web of companies being used by the Iranian state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. Its network of interlinked companies was registered in financial centres such as Hong Kong and Isle of Man, and in some cases had British directors. This level of sophistication should not come as a surprise when Iran has been subject to US asset freezes since 1979 and more widespread sanctions since 1984, during its war with Iraq.</p> <p>As modern sanctions have become more targeted and focused on isolating Iran from the global financial system, limiting its ability to earn foreign currency through sales of oil and gas, so too have the methods used to undermine them. Some anti-money-laundering specialists have been forced to run background checks on their students to ensure they are not trying to discover weaknesses in the system. And there are fears among oil traders that Iranian oil is being mixed with non-Iranian supplies.</p> <p>There will always be countries and companies who will choose to trade with Iran, regarding sanctions as western or US-inspired measures that are unenforceable against them. As a result, major western companies doing business in Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union are becoming increasingly wary of clients who may be discreetly trading with businesses in Iran. While the headlines are focused on allegations against Standard Chartered, today's major sanction-busting deals are being done by firms that are not household names. <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2012/07/31/white-house-orders-new-iran-sanctions-targets-2-banks-under-existing-measures/\" title=\"\">Last week's blacklisting by the US treasury</a> of Bank of Kunlun Co, part of the Chinese state-owned China National Petroleum Corp, and the Elaf Islamic Bank of Iraq for \"knowingly facilitating significant transactions and providing significant financial services for designated Iranian banks\" was not so widely reported.</p> <p>These types of transactions are indicative of the trend of a continued appetite by many to evade sanctions. Whether Standard Chartered is guilty or not, the US regulator's action shows that it is quickly losing patience with any foreign firm, British or Chinese, which attempts to have illicit dealings with Iran.</p>",
  "<p>The move in Malawi to close down Chinese businesses outside the four major cities has been condemned as xenophobic by rights organisations. A new law enforced on 31 July barred foreigners from carrying out trade in Malawi's outlying and rural areas.</p> <p>The investment and export promotion bill required traders to move to the southern African nation's major cities: Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba. The law is an attempt to protect local small-scale businesses from competition from foreign traders.</p> <p>Two prominent civil rights organisations, the Centre for Development of People and the Centre for Human Rights Rehabilitation (CHRR), have warned the Malawian government against encouraging the victimisation of foreign traders.</p> <p>\"We are worried about the increasing xenophobia sentiments and attacks on foreign nationals who are doing legal business across the country,\" the executive director of CHRR, Undule Mwakasungula, told IPS. He argued that the way Chinese traders were being treated was in violation of their human rights. \"Malawi should not be perpetrating xenophobic attacks on foreign nationals under the pretext of protecting the interests of local businesses.\"</p> <p>The new legislation comes immediately after Malawian traders in some rural areas grouped together in May and convinced local government authorities to force out Chinese traders. The protests first began in Karonga, a bustling town in the north of Malawi, which borders Tanzania, and later spread to all 28 districts in the country.</p> <p>While there are no official figures yet as to how many foreign traders have complied with the new law, IPS confirmed that in seven of the country's 28 districts, Chinese traders closed down their businesses. They now have to apply for new licences to trade in the specified four cities. But many may not qualify, as the new legislation requires investors to deposit a minimum of $250,000 in Malawi's central bank as startup capital.</p> <p>Malawi's minister of trade John Bande said that the new legislation was intended to regulate foreign investment. \"The new law clearly outlines what kind of businesses foreign investors will be allowed to get involved in. We will not accept foreigners to come all the way from places like China and open small businesses and shops in the rural areas of this country and compete with local traders,\" Bande said.</p> <p>But Mwakasungula said that the main challenge faced by local businesses was that they lacked the financial and technical muscle to compete favourably with the Chinese. He said that it was unreasonable for the government to resort to such a \"drastic decision\".</p> <p>\"It is unrealistic for the government to think that stopping foreign traders from doing business will automatically boost businesses run by locals,\" he said.</p> <p>There are no official figures on the number of Chinese or foreign traders there are in Malawi. However, Chinese-run shops, restaurants and lodges have sprouted across the country since 2007, when Malawi established diplomatic relations with China. The country had just abandoned its 41-year-old ties with Taiwan in favour of the economic giant.</p> <p>China has become Malawi's major economic partner since then. According to statistics from Malawi's ministry of trade, the country's trade volumes jumped to a record high of $100m in 2011 \u2013 a 400% increase from 2010.</p> <p>The two countries have a 2008 memorandum of understanding about issues of industry, trade and investment. It commits China to increasing Malawi's productive capacity in things like tobacco, cotton, mining, forestry, and fertiliser production.</p> <p>China has also given Malawi $260m in concessionary loans, grants and development support. This year, the country's first <a href=\"http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/05/china-keen-to-reverse-negative-image-in-africa/\" title=\"\">five-star hotel opened</a>. It includes 14 opulent presidential suites and a state-of-the-art conference centre, and was built by the Chinese government. In April 2012, China's direct investment in Africa surpassed $15.4bn, according to statistics from the Chinese embassy in Malawi.</p> <p>But ordinary Malawians are not happy with the influence that the Chinese have on the country's economy. Ellen Mwagomba, who has been at the forefront of the protests against Chinese traders in Karonga, has had a grocery store there since 2003. She told IPS that sales in her shop plummeted in 2008 when the Chinese started trading in the area.</p> <p>\"This place is a hive of activity since it is a border area. Business used to be good until the Chinese invaded us, bringing cheap goods and taking away our customers,\" Mwagomba said. She said that her grocery store lost business to Chinese traders as they charged as little as a quarter of the price that local traders asked for their goods.</p> <p>\"The goods I stock are from the local industry and from South Africa and are of good quality, they are not very cheap. But people would rather go for the cheap Chinese goods, which are also of cheap quality,\" said Mwagomba. She said that consumers preferred to purchase Chinese goods, to maximise their spending power. Up to 74% of the population in Malawi lives on less than $1.25 a day.</p> <p>But Mwagomba and other like-minded locals convinced the local assembly to remove Chinese traders from their district. \"They started leaving in June and business is now picking up for us, even before the new law became effective. I am now making up to $500 in sales. I could barely make $100 a day when the Chinese traders were here in full force,\" Mwagomba told IPS.</p> <p>But many Chinese feel they have been treated unfairly. Fu-han Chao used to run a restaurant in Mzimba district, in northern Malawi. But he was forced to close it down on at the end of June, before the new law came into effect, following an order by local government authorities after Malawian traders complained about the cheap goods sold at low prices by their Chinese counterparts.</p> <p>\"The local traders don't work as hard as we do. We open our shops much earlier and close them much later. We even open on Sundays when most businesses are closed, and we are hated for that. We have been treated very unfairly and I feel really angry about this. I felt threatened most times, and scared,\" Chao said.</p> <p>He added that business was meant to be about competition. Until he was forced to close his restaurant, he said he had a number of customers and was making up to $800 a day. \"We are contributing a lot to the economy of this country. I am yet to decide on what to do next. Maybe I will go back to China, but it is also tough to run a business back there because the population is high and the competition is also high,\" he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Chinese government has not supported its traders on this issue. At a recent press briefing, China's ambassador to Malawi, Pan Hejun, said: \"It is up to the Malawi government to thoroughly screen the Chinese nationals willing to invest in the country. These are small vendors and why should the Malawi government allow them to do business? They are capitalising on government's failure to screen foreign traders.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Rules should be respected and we don't encourage these traders to go into rural areas. We encourage real investors.\"</p>",
  "<p>Leicester's mayor has dubbed <a href=\"http://www.curveonline.co.uk/curve.php?pgid=0\" title=\"\">the Curve theatre</a> \"the most expensive and disastrous project this city has ever seen in its history.\"</p> <p>Peter Soulsby, who was the MP for Leicester South before being elected mayor in 2011, also revealed that the council was still incurring annual costs of \u00a3120,000 on the Curve's predecessor, the Haymarket Theatre, seven years after it closed.</p> <p>The new theatre, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3562763/The-Curve-theatre-in-Leicester-A-dramatic-statement.html\" title=\"\">designed by architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly</a>, came in at \u00a361m \u2013 more than twice the original budget \u2013 with the council's planned contribution of \u00a34.4m eventually reaching \u00a336.8m. \"Curve is a wonderful theatre and we're very proud of it. But it came at an enormous cost and it's quite clear that when it was planned people didn't control the costs,\" said Soulsby.</p> <p>In 2009, less than a year after the first performances in the new building, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/oct/01/leicester-curve-theatre\" title=\"\">an Audit Commission judged</a> that it did \"not represent good value for money\" and criticised \"weak project management arrangements at the start of the project.\"</p> <p>Fiona Allen, chief executive of the Curve, argued that the comments were not reflective of the theatre's artistic output and organisation practices.</p> <p>\"We're having a great deal of success,\" <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/36975/leicester-mayor-criticises-council-overspend\" title=\"\">she told The Stage</a>. \"We've just had [Hollywood producer] Harvey Weinstein talking about all the reasons why he's bringing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/17/gwyneth-paltrow-finding-neverland-musical\" title=\"\">Finding Neverland</a> to Curve \u2013 there aren't many theatres in the UK where he could bring it.</p> <p>\"Sales have gone up year on year, we're building audiences and our financial position continues to improve. We shouldn't dwell on the past. We really need to move forward.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, costs on the Haymarket, for which the council owns the lease, are down to annual maintenance costs of \u00a3100,000 and \u00a320,000 in empty property rates.</p> <p>Soulsby accused his predecessors at the city council of mismanagement: \"A buyer should have been found for the Haymarket before productions moved to what is now the Curve. I'm very actively trying to find a use for the Haymarket, but it's not easy in this economic climate.\"</p>",
  "<p>For transgender people, making the difficult decision to transition from being publicly a man or woman to the gender one really identifies with can be a traumatic experience.</p> <p>But while employers can help by showing understanding and support, some companies' response to the issue, though well-meaning, can lead to discrimination and humiliation.</p> <p>According to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender charity <a href=\"http://www.stonewallscotland.org.uk/scotland/\" title=\"\">Stonewall Scotland</a>, transgender issues still cause \"a lot of anxiety\" among employers.</p> <p>\"There's still an area of fear among employers about what they do, how they do it and whether they might get it wrong,\" said Stonewall Scotland director Colin McFarlane.</p> <p>He adds that while employers are making \"great strides\" in terms of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality, they are lagging behind providing for transgender staff, despite being covered by employment legislation under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents\" title=\"\">Equality Act 2010</a>.</p> <p>McFarlane explained: \"There's a lack of understanding about what the real issues are. Some employers lump trans issues in with sexuality. What we find in the work that we do, is employers still have that lack of understanding.\"</p> <p>Conversely, transgender activist Jane Fae says that in some cases, employers' self-conscious attempts to cater for transgender workers results in bosses tip-toeing around trying not to offend anyone, marginalising transgender staff even more.</p> <p>According to Fae, the biggest issue in many offices is use of the toilet. Employers who ban their transitioning staff from using the female toilet may face legal action. \"People try and fix this problem in ways that people often don't realise are offensive,\" she says. \"Such as saying if you're trans you can use the disabled facility.</p> <p>\"It just marks people out as different and if there are any employees who don't like people transitioning, it almost endorses that.\"</p> <p>It seems that many employers are simply guilty of over egging the pudding.</p> <p>\"When transitioning, from the public perspective, it's mostly about the clothes,\" Fae explains.</p> <p>\"Some people may also start to take hormones, which may have some side effects. But it's not a big thing. In some ways both the trans community and employers make too much of a deal about it.</p> <p>\"We don't accept people saying women on their periods who may be feeling hormonal shouldn't be expected to work. It's absolutely ludicrous and I think it's equally ludicrous to apply that same attitude to trans employees.\"</p> <p>The greatest hurdle to a smooth transition, however, is an administrative one and a case of not what you are, but who you are.</p> <p>Changing your forename and gender at work remains troublesome for many, despite its relative ease in the eyes of the law, and it's a sticky situation which Fae has been campaigning to change.</p> <p>\"The problem has arisen over the last decade, because of money laundering and the terror threat, people are scared silly about identity,\" she explains.</p> <p>\"If you come into work today as Matthew and then come in tomorrow as a girl called Carol, unless you have an identical twin somewhere, you don't need much in the way of proof.</p> <p>\"People might say they can't call you Carol unless you have a piece of paper to prove it, but that's wrong in law and actually, the Inland Revenue will quite happily change your name and gender on the system with the same level of security. So, it's not an issue.</p> <p>\"Therefore, we are and have been putting more and more silly additional requirements into the pot.\"</p> <p>Being transgender, an umbrella term used to describe a whole range of people whose gender identity differs in some way from what they were assigned at birth, has no impact on a person's work output and a progressive equality policy can enhance a company's reputation and improve employees' performance and productivity.</p> <p>Fae says the solution is to offer clarity on all the issues surrounding transitioning and being transgender, as well as providing a safe space for people to discuss their fears and anxieties.</p> <p>\"There are people, who for religious reasons, find it difficult to accept having trans women at work and there has to be a space for them to explore that,\" she insists.</p> <p>\"But the key thing is the employer needs to make it absolutely clear that there will be no leeway or concessions for people who act in a discriminatory manner as it not only reflects on the company, but will be treated as a criminal offence.</p> <p>\"On the one hand, give people the information and a space to understand and know more so they understand that transitioning is a very traumatic part of someone's life, but at the same time there should be penalties for people who have a go.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>I began this book reluctantly \u2013 I was deep into Hilary Mantel's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/13/bring-up-bodies-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bring Up the Bodies</em></a>, which is pretty much the exact opposite \u2013 but by the end I wanted to hand out copies to all those poor folks I see squirming their way through the squalid prose-dungeons of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fifty-shades-of-grey\" title=\"\"><em>Fifty Shades</em></a>. I wanted to launch a new British magazine especially for long-form journalism. I wanted to go out and round up a good few of the nation's so-called columnists and shame them into admitting that the weekly crap-farragoes that they are pretending to call careers will no longer do. I wanted to say \"<em>that's</em> what I'm talking about\".</p> <p>What am I talking about? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/society/9780099572350/pulphead-notes-from-the-other-side-of-america\" title=\"\"><em>Pulphead</em></a> is a collection of essays that appeared in various American magazines written by a journalist in his late 30s, whom almost nobody in Britain will know. But my guess is that those of you who like real writing (I know you're out there) will soon come to love <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-jeremiah-sullivan\" title=\"\">John Jeremiah Sullivan</a> \u2013 especially if he turns his talent to writing fiction, which, on the evidence of this collection, would not be too great a stretch. My stateside siblings tell me that he's already got a foot on the same escalator that took <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\" title=\"\">Foster Wallace</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathan-franzen\" title=\"\">Franzen</a> and the gang <em>per aspera ad astra</em>. Meanwhile, various people are calling him the next <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/tomwolfe\" title=\"\">Tom Wolfe</a> this and the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/huntersthompson\" title=\"\">Hunter S Thompson</a> that. Who knows? I'd say hold off a spell \u2013 he's simply not produced enough assessable work. But I certainly found this collection wonderfully engaging, lucid, intelligent, entertaining, interesting and amusing.</p> <p>The first pleasure of <em>Pulphead</em> is the subject matter. There is the best essay you will ever read on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson\" title=\"\">Michael Jackson</a> and the only essay you'll ever read on Axl Rose. There's the oddly emotional and disconcerting account of attending a Christian rock music festival entitled Upon This Rock. There's the story of Sullivan's time living with the mad old American writer Andrew Nelson Lytle, who late one night finally got around to touching the young John Jeremiah's genitals. There's a supreme piece of writing \u2013 part analysis, part paean \u2013 about reality television. There's an account of going to meet Bunny Wailer, the only surviving member of Bob Marley's original band, in Jamaica. There's a disarmingly convivial trip to Disney World. There's a wonderfully illuminating investigation into the lyrics of a pre-second world war blues song \u2013 and in particular what the word \"kind\" once meant \u2013 in the sense of \"a little more than kin and less than kind\". There's a moving and hyper-real account of Sullivan's brother's near death by accidental electrocution, a post-Katrina excursion to the Gulf Coast, some piquant pages on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tea-party-movement\" title=\"\">Tea Party</a> and a piece about the coming war between homo sapiens and the rest of the animal kingdom.</p> <p>The second pleasure is the sophistication. So often the clarity of a writer's voice comes at the expense of a subtlety in tone. Not here. The two best pieces of the ensemble \u2013 Getting Down to What is Really Real and Upon This Rock \u2013 are written with such a well-judged balance of close-up love and objective report that they subverted my prejudices entirely and left me admiring Sullivan's way of admiring. I went into these chapters belligerently not giving a toss about reality TV and believing the Christian rock music scene to be the single most colossally redundant human phenomenon to date; I came out a changed reader. Sullivan had guided me through these alien worlds in a way that revealed to&#xa0;me their interesting geometries and&#xa0;their <em>raisons d'\u00eatre</em>. What more can&#xa0;the writer do?</p> <p>Not only do the essays engage, they are also richly informative. I finally understood the title of one of my very favourite songs \u2013 I and I by Bob Dylan \u2013 as a Rastafarian expression. And I found myself jotting down notes in order to seek out the songs Sullivan cited \u2013 one of which, Let Him Go, I am listening to right now. Again: what more can you ask?</p> <p>But the greatest pleasure of all was the writing itself. There are essayists who rely on their subject to create interest and there are essayists who rely on their style. Sullivan deploys both. In The Last Wailer, he describes the notorious Jamaican drug lord and gangster Christopher Coke (oh, nominative determinism) as a \"short, thick, somewhat pan-faced man, who keeps a low profile and always seems to be smiling at an inward joke\". In the reality TV essay, he renders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/richard-branson\" title=\"\">Richard Branson</a> as \"that weird and whispery mogul-faun, Sir Richard\". Elsewhere, \"knuckles are cubed with arthritis\" and the music in a nightclub is \"like a rabbit's heartbeat in the core of your brain\". Everywhere, Sullivan's love of language, his skill and inventiveness, reminded me afresh of the delight of reading people who can actually write. And even when he didn't quite pull it off \u2013 the interior of a rented mobile home \"smelled of spoiled vacations and amateur porn shoots wrapped in motel shower curtains and left in the sun\" \u2013 I found myself greatly enjoying the failure.</p> <p>I had only one reservation. Hovering&#xa0;somewhere in the coulisse of these performances, there seems to be an anxiety about authenticity. This manifests itself as an emphasis on&#xa0;what&#xa0;\"actually\" happened here, what the reader might check up on there, a habit of breaking out into bald film dialogue-style quotes as if to prove such and such was \"really\" said. In one story (the weakest), Violence of the Lambs \u2013 about the animal-human war \u2013 Sullivan adds a coda: \"Big parts of this piece I made up\u2026\" He seems angry about having to admit to fabrication \"because of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/us-news-blog/2012/jul/30/jonah-lehrer-quits-new-yorker\" title=\"\">certain scandals in the past</a> with made-up stories\" and then writes a second postscript about new \"facts\" discovered. Sure, there are (adolescent) jokes in play here \u2013 about \"fact-checking\" journalism, about editors, about fabrication, about scientific horror stories \u2013 but there's also just straightforward bullshit at the expense of the reader. My take: expect a novel&#xa0;sometime.</p>",
  "<p>The number of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders in the past three months fell to its lowest level since 2010, according to official figures.</p> <p>There were 8,500 posessions in the second quarter of 2012, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said \u2013 about 1,000 fewer than in the first three months of 2012 and the lowest number since the final quarter of 2010.</p> <p>The CML said the drop in the second quarter of the year was in line with a seasonal pattern it has seen in each of the past three years.</p> <p>The number of borrowers who have fallen behind with their mortgage payments was broadly the same as compared with the same quarter in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012.</p> <p>\"The figures show that lenders, borrowers and debt advisers are working together to get through the current period of economic difficulty and keep mortgage possessions in check,\" the CML's director general Paul Smee said.</p> <p>Previous figures from the CML showed that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/09/uk-home-repossessions-fall-four-year-low\" title=\"UK home repossessions fall to four-year low, says CML\">number of UK homes being repossessed fell to its lowest level in four years in 2011</a>. However, the group said it expected there to be a higher number of people facing more serious problems this year.</p> <p>It predicts repossessions will rise from 37,000 in 2011 to 45,000 this year, as people's budgets remain under pressure at a time of high unemployment and low wage growth.</p> <p>\"That repossessions are likely to rise for the year as a whole is depressingly predictable,\" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. \"Although interest rates are expected to remain at 0.5% for the foreseeable future, a growing number of borrowers are still struggling.\"</p> <p>\"Mortgage rates continue to rise, despite the non-movement of base rate, with more than a million homeowners seeing an increase in mortgage rates in May, for example. Those with little or no equity in their homes don't have the luxury of being able to remortgage on to a cheaper deal.\"</p> <p>The struggle some homeowners face was laid bare earlier this week in testimonials from Guardian readers as part of a series about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/financial-crisis-five-years-on-readers\" title=\"Financial crisis, five years on: readers' stories\">how the recession has changed their lives</a>.</p> <p>Tim Robson, 49, an unemployed senior civil servant from south Wales said: \"I was a senior manager at a local council when I was made redundant in 2010 earning more than \u00a370,000 a year. Now I'm being offered jobs at the bottom being paid \u00a316,000 and my jobseekers allowance is about to run out. If things don't improve, this year I will have to sell the house, but the market is so depressed it'll be a struggle to sell it.\"</p> <p>Many homeowners face repossession not because they refuse to downsize, but because they cannot sell their homes.</p> <p>\"The situation is particularly hard for people who have bought in the past six or seven years and find that their properties are now worth less than they paid for them,\" said former estate agent and housing commentator Henry Pryor. \"For those people, even if they want to move to restore their position, they can't because they don't have enough equity to get a new mortgage deal.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The shock in today's figures is that they haven't grown larger quicker. However, lenders do seem to be working harder than ever to make sure people stay in their homes, and I hope this will continue.\"</p> <p>Additional figures from the CML show that landlords are continuing to cash in on the property market. Buy-to-let lending increased by 5% in the second quarter of 2012, with the volume of loans up 14% year-on-year.</p>",
  "<p>Philip Marlowe, that hardest of hard-boiled private investigators, is preparing to saunter back on to the literary stage next year courtesy of the Man Booker prize-winning novelist John Banville.</p> <p>In an agreement with the estate of Marlowe's creator Raymond Chandler, Banville will write a new Philip Marlowe novel, for publication next year. As well as featuring Marlowe, \"a lone wolf, unmarried, getting middle-aged, and not rich\", as the detective describes himself, Banville will bring back his friend, the policeman Bernie Ohls. The novel, which Banville will pen under his crime-writing pseudonym Benjamin Black, will be set in the 40s in Bay City \u2013 Chandler's fictional stand-in for Santa Monica \u2013 and will, said its US publisher Henry Holt, \"feature Chandler's hallmark noir ambience\".</p> <p>Chandler's are big shoes to fill. He wrote seven Marlowe novels, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9780140108927/the-big-sleep\" title=\"The Big Sleep By Raymond Chandler\">The Big Sleep</a> in 1939 to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780140108972/playback\" title=\"Playback By Raymond Chandler\">Playback</a> in 1958, with his eighth, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9780708848234/poodle-springs\" title=\"Poodle Springs By Raymond Chandler \">Poodle Springs</a>, unfinished when he died in 1959. It was completed by author Robert B Parker in 1989. Parker also penned a follow-up, Perchance to Dream, which received a less than enthusiastic welcome: <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/philip-marlowe-set-to-return-in-novel-by-john-banville/\" title=\"'Mr Parkers Marlowe] has no turbulent soul '\">Martin Amis wrote in the New York Times Book Review</a> that his version of Chandler's creation \"has no turbulent soul, no inner complication to keep in check. Mr Parker neither understands nor respects Marlowe's inhibitions; he fritters them away, unconsciously questing for some contemporary ideal of gruff likability. By the end of the book, Marlowe has become an affable goon.\"</p> <p>Banville, though, is delighting in the opportunity. \"I love the challenge of following in the very large footsteps of Raymond Chandler,\" he said. \"I began reading Chandler as a teenager, and frequently return to the novels. This idea has been germinating for several years and I relish the prospect of setting a book in Marlowe's California, which I always think of in terms of Edward Hopper's paintings. Bay City will have a slightly surreal, or hyper-real, atmosphere that I look forward to creating.\"</p> <p>He admitted it was \"rather intimidating\", however, as \"Chandler's is such a particular voice\" \u2013 the Marlowe novels are narrated by the wise-cracking detective, in a staccato, distinctive style. \"I hope \u2013 that is, Benjamin Black hopes \u2013 to write in the spirit of Chandler, rather than to try to ape his style,\" Banville said. \"But the prospect of reviving Marlowe, and setting a noir novel in 'Bay City' in the early 40s, is thrilling.\"</p> <p>Chandler himself said of Marlowe: \"I see him always in a lonely street, in lonely rooms, puzzled but never quite defeated.\" The detective says: \"When I get knocked off in a dark alley sometime, if it happens, as it could to anyone in my business, nobody will feel that the bottom has dropped out of his or her life.\"</p> <p>Ian Rankin, in an introduction to The Big Sleep, called Marlowe, \"a knight of sorts \u2013 tarnished, to be sure, a knight errant. The work he does is dirty, but he maintains his own moral code.\" He said Chandler provided \"the template for much of the urban crime fiction that came after, as well as most modern Hollywood thrillers, [and] few writers have come close to matching him\".</p> <p>John Sterling, an editor at large for Macmillan, acquired the as yet untitled novel. \"John Banville writing as Benjamin Black recreating Raymond Chandler is a perfect literary hand-off,\" he said. \"There is no one better to bring Philip Marlowe back to life for the vast readership that loves noir crime fiction.\"</p>",
  "<p>Public reactions to the churches' views on gay marriage currently range from weary indifference to head-scratching bewilderment to angry consternation and all the way to incandescent outrage. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/aug/03/tainted-case-against-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">Andrew Brown's blogpost</a> attacking two recent church interventions on the question tends towards the third of those responses. It is certainly the case that some such interventions needlessly place the churches in the line of fire.</p> <p>One of the things attracting Brown's ire was a <a href=\"http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/2012/07/26/prime-minister-urged-to-correct-serious-misrepresentation/\" title=\"\">letter to David Cameron</a> from Anglican Mainstream, an association of conservative Anglicans, responding to <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/lgbt-reception/\" title=\"\">the PM's remarks</a> at a reception for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups at 10 Downing Street. The letter was within its rights to challenge Cameron's ill-informed misrepresentation of the churches' attitudes towards gay people. But it included the unsustainable claim that people of homosexual orientation \"have always been fully welcomed\" in the churches. Whatever the official teaching of the churches may have been, their practice has all too frequently fallen lamentably and hurtfully short of the goal of \"welcome\". Many homosexual Christians \u2013 including some I have known, and including many who would call themselves theologically conservative \u2013 will readily confirm this, at least if asked by someone who by their practice and tone of voice has earned their trust.</p> <p>But whatever the shortcomings of individual statements on the question, the churches' opposition to gay marriage is now facing the undiscriminating charge that it is driven by \"homophobia\". In fact, most of their public statements on the matter are only attempts to re-articulate what has long been the most fundamental and enduring principle of Christian (and Jewish) sexual ethics, which is that human beings have been created in such a way that sexual union is appropriately enjoyed in the context of permanent heterosexual commitment. This principle is as much a restraint on heterosexual behaviour as it is on homosexual behaviour (although the churches' voice on the latter would have been a good deal more compelling had they demonstrated a more consistent track record on the former).</p> <p>The principle is, of course, profoundly disagreeable and sometimes reprehensible to much secular, and some revisionist Christian, opinion. But a position that has shaped one of the most formative ethical practices of western culture cannot be presumptively dismissed as driven by mere prejudice. That is an evasion of reasoned debate.</p> <p>What is more, most churches are very familiar with the distinction between what they believe about the appropriateness of same-sex sexual relationships and what they believe about how the state should, pursuant to the public good, order those or any other kinds of personal relationships. They are needing to dust down that distinction today. Churches have over the centuries lived, comfortably or contentiously, with a wide variety of legal marriage regimes. Most of them long ago came to terms with the state's permitting remarriage (and many eventually came to allow it within their own ranks). Half a century ago, the Church of England was itself in the forefront of calling for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts. Most have now adjusted themselves, albeit reluctantly in some cases, to the existence of civil partnerships. The question of whether there should be yet another significant change in marriage law \u2013 albeit possibly the most far-reaching they have yet had to contemplate \u2013 is a challenge that should not be foreign to them.</p> <p>As they reflect on that question, they will be aware that the last 10 years has seen a rapid collapse in support for the current legal definition of marriage, and examining how they should position themselves in such a radically reconfigured cultural landscape. Most would still prefer to retain the current definition, and some are campaigning vigorously to that end. There have indeed been cogent defences of such a position (<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/03/13/3452229.htm\" title=\"\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1722155\" title=\"\">here</a>) although they have yet to be projected successfully into British public debate.</p> <p>Yet a growing number are also ready to acknowledge that, in a rapidly secularising as well as deeply plural society, such an option may no longer be democratically sustainable and that new legal models may need to be entertained. One option is at least to call for a separation of civil marriage ceremonies from religious ones, allowing both state and church greater freedom to order their own affairs as they see fit. Another is for civil partnerships to be opened to heterosexual partners, allowing Christians (and others) to consider that legal option for themselves instead of an expanded definition of \"marriage\" they cannot own. A more radical option would be a universal regime of civil partnerships (open to both heterosexual and homosexual couples, and possibly other household relationships) in which \"marriage\" is withdrawn from the state's purview, yet with the state remaining fully responsible for the protection of the interests of children or separating partners.</p> <p>These are not exhaustive, and none has yet won, or is likely soon to win, anything like a consensus. The churches still have a lot of hard work to do to articulate a public position on marriage that is not only true to their own convictions but also credible as a thoughtful contribution to public policy \u2013 but then so does David Cameron.</p>",
  "<p>Shirley MacLaine, the Oscar-winning star of Terms of Endearment, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/24/downton-abbey-dowager-countess-american\" title=\"\">is sweeping into Downton this autumn as the scabrous Martha Levinson</a>, mother to Elizabeth McGovern's Lady Cora and the brass that facilitated her daughter's marriage to Hugh Bonneville's Lord Grantham.</p> <p>And doesn't she know it. \"Here's to the future as long it's not like the past,\" says MacLaine's Martha L in what is obviously the real point of the casting: the chance for a sparring match with Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess of Grantham.</p> <p>It is the ultimate transatlantic culture clash \u2013 and as delicious as it sounds.

And they don't really take us too seriously either.</p> <p>To many American minds, fantasy and olden times equals British accents \u2013 whether it's Game of Thrones or the Lord of the Rings or the faraway history of ancient Rome in the BBC/HBO co-production.</p> <p>And when British actors get to play the lead in a US series they are never allowed their own accents \u2013 think Hugh Laurie in House, Jamie Bamber in Battlestar Galactica, Stephen Moyer in True Blood, Damian Lewis in Band of Brothers and Homeland.</p> <p>But when the Yanks are in our stuff, well, we do tend to fall over ourselves, being always the junior partner in the so-called special relationship.</p> <p>All the cameos in Extras and, more recently, Life's Too Short have been to show what great sports Hollywood gods such as Samuel L Jackson, Robert De Niro, Depp \u2013 again \u2013 and Steve Carell are.</p> <p>Depp was also treated like royalty by the cast of The Fast Show when he made his cameo in the last ever episode of the BBC sketch comedy. Paul Whitehouse as the \"suits you, sir\" tailor asks him if he had \"boned anyone yet, sir?\", a joke which hinges on the fact that Depp is an A-Lister deigning to grace a British TV comedy.</p> <p>More recently Robert Vaughn was spoken about in hushed tones when it was announced that he was going to star in Hustle, as the sharp, smart and cool head hustler Albert Stroller.</p> <p>The only time I think we Brits have ever had the upper hand is in Episodes, the recent BBC/Showtime co-production predicated on the joke about two UK comedy writers (Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig) who have their Bafta-winning comedy ruined by a US network \u2013 and LeBlanc.</p> <p>But even here, as well as the satirical depiction of US network TV as brash, vulgar and stupid, the comedy also derives from the Brits being uptight and endlessly humiliated by their American paymasters. So the joke is also on us, once again.</p>",

  "<p>This is the one Usain Bolt always took seriously. The 200m, the event he always believed was his. It's the one for which, in Beijing, he bothered to tie up the laces of both his shoes, keeping his foot on the throttle all the way to the finish line.</p> <p>It is also the one in which his start does not seem significantly slower than those of his rivals. In the second of Wednesday night's three semi-finals he appeared to be level with Ademir Da Silva of Brazil, running in the lane outside him, within half a dozen strides, and by the time he came off the bend there was a big stretch of clear track between the defending champion and the rest of the field.</p> <p>He was able to enjoy the latter stages of the race in comfort, easing up on his way to a time of 20.18sec while keeping an eye on his rivals' progress on the big screen at the end of the home straight. Behind him came the 20-year-old Anaso Jobodwana of South Africa, taking the second automatic qualifying place for Thursday's final.</p> <p>\"It's all about going through as easy as possible,\" Bolt said. \"This is my favourite event. I'm focused and I'm ready. The track is fast and it's going to be a good race. There are a lot of good competitors, a lot of people who could spoil the party.\"</p> <p>The men's 200m has been an incident-packed and occasionally lurid event in recent Olympics, on and off the track. After a bout of food poisoning two weeks before the Games cost an enfeebled Michael Johnson, the odds-on favourite at the age of 24, a place in the 1992 final, the great man turned up in his golden shoes in Atlanta and set a world record that would stand for 12 years, until Bolt finally lowered it.</p> <p>In Sydney the gold medal was unexpectedly won by Konstantinos Kenteris of Greece, whose sudden emergence provoked widespread suspicions. They were reinforced four years later when he failed to defend the title in his home Games after an extraordinary episode the day before the opening ceremony involving a faked motorcycle accident on the way to a drug test, followed by a week-long hospital stay that turned out to be equally bogus. Later the Greek police found 30 boxes of steroids in his coach's office. Kenteris was banned for two years.</p> <p>Shawn Crawford won the 2004 gold medal, and was presented with the silver in Beijing four years later after Churandy Martina, of the Netherlands, and Wallace Spearmon of the US were disqualified from second and third places for running outside their lanes. Crawford later sent Martina his silver medal with a message saying: \"I know this can't replace the moment, but I want you to have this because I believe it's rightfully yours.\" The gold, of course, had gone to Bolt, who became the first man to win the two individual sprint titles while setting world records in each.</p> <p>Jamaica's two top sprinters seemed to have made an adequate recovery from their celebrations at the weekend after finishing first and second in the 100m final on Sunday. Yohan Blake rocketed ahead in the first semi-final but significantly slowed up to finish in 20.01, beating Spearmon by a hundredth of a second. \"A walk in the park,\" he called it.</p> <p>Christophe Lemaitre, the great hope of French sprinting, was a further hundredth back in third. Two years ago he became the only man to win the 100m, 200m and 4x100m in the European championships and Wednesday night's 20.03 was good enough to get the 22-year-old through to the final as one of the two fastest losers in the competition, along with Alex Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez of Ecuador, who finished third in Bolt's semi-final.</p> <p>The last of the semi-finals was won by Martina, who was born 28 years ago in Cura\u00e7ao and has won titles at the Pan-American and South American Games as well as in the European championships. He finished in 20.17, ahead of the 22-year-old Warren Weir, a member, like Bolt and Blake, of the hugely successful Racers Track Club in Kingston. Christian Malcolm, the Welsh runner who has been around long enough to be described as ageless but is actually still only 33, finished third, but his time of 20.51 was not good enough to take him into a final in which he finished a surprised fifth in Beijing.</p> <p>Up to that point it had been a mixed evening for Jamaica. Richard Phillips fell painfully in the semi-final of the 110m hurdles but the 22-year-old Hansle Parchment \u2013 a psychology student who comes from St Thomas \u2013 the mountainous parish on the south-eastern tip of Jamaica where Paul Bogle led a group of former slaves in the bloodily suppressed Morant Bay rebellion in 1865, ending on the gallows but becoming one of the island's seven official national heroes in the process \u2013 set a new national record of 13.14sec on his way to winning the bronze medal.</p> <p>Veronica Campbell-Brown, the reigning 200m champion, was unable to defend her title, finishing fourth, while her compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the winner of the gold medal in the 100m, took the silver behind Allyson Felix of the United States.</p> <p>It has taken a while for the London 2012 Olympic Stadium disc jockey to recognise that Jamaican music ought to play some part in the soundtrack to an evening of modern international athletics, but on Wednesday night, between the first and second semi-finals, the penny finally dropped and Desmond Dekker's Israelites rang out, followed by the Specials version of A Message to You, Rudy. A little burst of Burning Spear or Maytals would not go amiss here in the coming days.</p>",

In the summer of 1969, we sat, enthralled, as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed Apollo 11's Eagle space ship and took humanity's first steps on a world other than Earth. Our guide that day was Walter Cronkite. He and his CBS News colleagues assembled information, expert commentary and more \u2013 including the grainy black-and-white videos from Nasa, the American space agency \u2013 and we reveled as history was made before our eyes, in real time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394427260\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/8/1344443070314/waltercronkite_220.jpg\" alt=\"Walter Cronkite, CBS News, 1963\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walter Cronkite, anchoring CBS News, in 1963.

When we saw Armstrong descend from the lander's ladder and put the first human footprints on the lunar surface, it had already happened. My father had explained one much-earlier night, as we gazed skyward, that when we look at stars we are seeing the past, and now I understood what that really meant.</p> <p>This all came back to me on Sunday night as I watched another historic space flight, <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/\">the landing of the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover</a>. My computer screen \u2013 like most people who saw this, I watched online \u2013 showed the telemetry from the spacecraft as it descended toward the surface. I and the Nasa team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were spectators, really, because what we were seeing was some 14 minutes in the past. So by that moment, Curiosity had already landed safely, in a stunning achievement of engineering, science and exploration \u2026 or it had not.</p> <p>I also reflected on a huge change we've seen in the media since the Apollo days. I was watching the feed directly from Nasa, unfiltered. This wasn't so much a matter of choice, because the major broadcast news operations didn't much care; they gave minimal time, or none at all, to the landing. I'm certain that Cronkite, if not the current corporate raiders who run CBS and other channels' news operations, would have been at his anchor desk on Sunday evening. He believed in science and space exploration, and would have recognized that this Mars landing, while not the first, was such a breakthrough. Yet, perhaps surprisingly for someone of my background in the news business, I didn't much care that the news organizations had so little interest, because Nasa was doing such a good job on its own.</p> <p>Nasa has always demonstrated media savvy, but its performance in recent years has become something quite remarkable. It has used modern media tools in ways that set it apart from any other government body I can name: pushing the edges of media exploration just as it pushes the boundaries of our solar system and beyond. For years now, the wallpaper on my computer has been a picture from one of Nasa's many troves of stunning photos, sometimes a distant nebula or galaxy or close-up of a nearby planet or Earth.</p> <p>With the Mars Curiosity mission, the JPL pushed media boundaries in some striking new ways. One of my favorites, on <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/participate/\">the mission's \"Participate\" web page</a>, is the \"Be a Martian\" virtual reality apps (web and mobile). And check out a <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spacecraft-3d/id541089908?mt=8\">clever augmented-reality app</a> (iOS now; Android soon) that gives you an essentially 3D view of the rover and its instruments, <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2408054,00.asp\">among many other apps</a>, images, social media experiments and more.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/\">first thumbnail photos after landing in the Gale Crater</a> on Sunday night were almost retro: black and white and showing very little. Then, we got a glimpse of Mount Sharp, where the rover will look for evidence that the conditions for live (as we know it) may have existed in Mars. The most <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-232\">striking image, so far, from the mission is the picture taken</a> from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite. We look down on Curiosity as it descends by parachute through Mars' thin atmosphere. Again, this isn't the first image of its kind (a photo from an earlier mission was much grainier), but this one is going to stick in my mind, because it combines so many elements of Nasa's expertise \u2013 and tickles my amazing-media instincts.</p> <p>My admiration for what the Mars Science Laboratory team has done, and their craft's explorations to come, is almost unbounded. I also admire Nasa's use of media to tell this story. But we all need to recognize the limitations of self-coverage, even as we applaud the good work this time.</p> <p>Every institution \u2013 company, government agency, you name it \u2013 is a media operation, too. Some are much better at it than others; advocacy groups and thinktanks, in particular, have become <a href=\"http://mediactive.com/4-3-advocates-the-almost-journalists/\">what I've called \"almost-journalists\"</a>, part of the journalistic ecosystem even if they are not actual journalists. But their motives in the media they produce are inevitably affected by self-interest.</p> <p>So, I did not look first to Nasa when two space shuttles were lost in flight during that program's existence. Although I did check out what Nasa had to say, I turned to more traditional media sources, and, as the web developed, well-informed bloggers and others who were not insiders. Fairly or not, I don't expect insiders \u2013 especially in governments and companies \u2013 to report in timely or straightforward ways about their failures.</p> <p>On Sunday night, it would have taken nothing away from the Nasa team to have had a preeminent journalist, a latter-day Cronkite, bringing outside expertise and context to the event. But in the absence of the kind of serious investment in coverage that I believe this mission deserved, I was still able to experience the wonder of it all in that semi-real time in which we all exist in the space age. Good enough.</p>",
  "<p>Up and down the country, corporate bodies called Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) are increasingly administering urban centres, offering their paying members privileged access to unelected officials who are literally 'on call' to take their grievances directly to policy makers. In the case of Liverpool City Council's recent decision to regulate busking and street entertainment, we find a lesson in the pitfalls of charging unaccountable bodies with directing democracy on the public's behalf.</p> <p>Would-be performers in Liverpool city centre must now sign up to a mandatory licensing scheme and obtain a photo ID card before they can book a two hour slot to play in council-designated pitches. The scheme requires that entertainers be bound by a number of restrictive terms and conditions. These range from entertainers being forbidden to sit on the floor or occupy a pitch more than 1.5 metres in a diameter, to a clause granting council officials the right to stop a performance purely on the grounds of personal taste - turning enforcement officers into what one <a href=\"http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2012/07/09/liverpool-musicians-take-to-the-streets-to-protest-against-council-s-new-busking-rules-100252-31357139/\">busker describes</a> as \"a poor man's Simon Cowell\". Any person failing to comply with these terms and conditions will be issued with a letter threatening prosecution for trespass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-413949931\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/1/24/1327424040980/Silver-Seas-busking-in-Lo-001.jpg\" alt=\"Silver Seas busking in London\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silver Seas busking in London Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In essence, Liverpool's policy is an attempt to bring busking and street performance under the remit of the 2003 Licensing Act, despite <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/LiftingtheBurden.pdf\">clear statements</a> published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in 2006 that busking is <a href=\"http://keepstreetslive.com/concise-objections#fn-393-1\">not a licensable </a>activity under that legislation. The legally-questionable nature of Liverpool's policy does not end there, for it attempts to make it an offence for anybody under the age of 18 to busk, despite central <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/hl1/help/dg_064158\">government guidelines</a> clearly stating that busking is permitted for anybody over the age of 14.</p> <p>Accounts from buskers suggest that the policy was pushed through council meetings, with their recommendations flatly ignored. Jonny Walker, a Liverpool-born busker and singer-songwriter, was involved in the council's consultation process:</p> <blockquote> <p>I was invited by officials to look at the proposed policy. I had major issues with it and was asked to prepare a report with suggestions for how to improve it. My report was ignored and no changes were made to the policy which was then rubber stamped at a council meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Once he realized his views had not been taken into account in the finished policy, Walker started <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/keep-spontaneous-street-performance-alive\">a petition</a> which has garnered more than 3,000 signatures to date and launched <a href=\"http://keepstreetslive.com/\">a campaign</a> to urge the council to rethink its policy. The campaign has gained the backing of the Musician's Union.</p> <p>Diane Widdison, national organiser of the union, has said that Liverpool City Council did not consult them regarding the new policy:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Musician's Union are happy to help the council put together a best practice guide for buskers. We would suggest a working party which includes street artists and performers so we can agree on a guide which is acceptable to both sides. We do not agree with making the process overly bureaucratic or too restrictive for no good reason.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> Liverpool city council responds: </p> <blockquote> <p>In essence, we are trying to balance the needs of all the people who use the city centre \u2013 shoppers, visitors, people who work there and buskers.</p> <p>While there may be claims that there is a lot of opposition to the policy, it has also been welcomed by many people, especially on grounds of reducing noise and ending repetitive songs.</p> </blockquote> <p>The council adds that the idea is also to be fairer to all buskers and potential buskers by preventing the same ones hogging pitches for hours on end.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is also important to note that the policy will be reviewed in three months and a panel including buskers, representatives from the musician unions and other interested parties will meet before the end of August to discuss the policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>The council stresses that the regulations are not an attempt to stop busking, but to provide a balance between the different people using the city. </p> <p>The elected member in charge of the policy, Coun Steve Munby, Liverpool's cabinet member for neighbourhoods,<a href=\"http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=216314\"> has claimed </a>that the policy was crafted to deal with the many complaints the council receives<br>from businesses and shoppers about noise levels, repetitive performances and the number of buskers at certain times.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uii6wH9t5Sk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uii6wH9t5Sk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Munby says that buskers add \"animation and colour to the centre\" but on some Saturdays, there have been 12 performers in a short stretch of Church Street competing \"in effect for limited cash.\" He added that having a regulated system for street entertainment is in the best interests of buskers, businesses, shoppers and other city centre users and brings Liverpool into line with other major cities.</p> <p>Ged Gibbons, CEO of Liverpool's <a href=\"http://www.citycentralbid.com/\">City Central BID</a> and champion of the new policy, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>This new <a href=\"http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=216314\">busking policy</a> is hugely welcome and will make a real difference to the vibrancy of the city centre</p> </blockquote> <p><br>and has <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uii6wH9t5Sk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">claimed</a> to have received regular telephone complaints from the likes of M&amp;S and Primark about troublesome buskers. In the same vein, <a href=\"http://councillors.liverpool.gov.uk/documents/g12428/Public%20reports%20pack%2008th-Jun-2012%2009.00%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10\">minutes from the council </a>Cabinet's agenda in which the policy's terms and conditions can be found, describe the policy as crafted to deal with long-standing \"complaints from businesses, residents and others\".</p> <p>However, information acquired under Freedom of Information legislation shows that as of November 2011 the number of city shopkeepers who formally complained to the Council to regulate buskers/street performers was so low that the council themselves do not bother to <a href=\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/93739/response/235594/attach/html/2/174593%20Nightingale%20Response%20131211.doc.html\">record complaints</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>[...] due to the immediate nature of the complaint the majority of complainants simply draw the matter to our street Nuisance Officers but do not formally complain. Subsequently the licensing department do not formally record the number of complaints they receive regarding buskers/street performers.</p> </blockquote> <p>And why do affected retailers not formally complain? The answer, in short, is that they do not need to. That is what Liverpool's City Central BID is for.</p> <p>Around 650 businesses currently make up the BID, and each pays a levy on top of their business rates to fund it. Besides extra cleaning, care and security, this levy effectively grants businesses an amplified voice in local democracy. Like BIDs in other British cities, Liverpool's is a quasi-governmental corporate body which works with local authorities, but is not wholly accountable to them. Karen Lappin, Store Manager for Liverpool's Blacks, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44317280\">explains</a> what you get with membership into Liverpool's City Central BID: </p> <blockquote> <p>Ged [Gibbons] will come round, one of the team will come round, and they'll sit down and ask how they can help you. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Critics of the new busking policy argue that with its access to policymakers, Liverpool's City Central BID has hastily embarked upon the needless regulation of Liverpool's street performance culture under the banner of 'business improvement'.</p> <p><em>Christian Eriksson is an independent researcher and investigative journalist.
