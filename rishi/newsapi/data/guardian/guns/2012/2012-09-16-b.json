  "<p>An Egyptian soldier was killed and seven were injured in a set of retaliatory attacks on security forces in Sinai on Sunday as the fallout from a major attack that killed 16 border guards last month continues in the peninsula.</p> <p>Security forces had on Sunday carried out a series of raids arresting suspected militants linked to the 5 August attack near the town of Sheikh Zuwayed, four miles from the border town of Rafah. The raids were met with almost immediate retaliation by armed gunmen and a three-hour shootout ensued according to witnesses in the area. One soldier was killed and seven injured, in addition to two civilian injuries as a result of the clashes. The soldier died from wounds sustained in the clashes after being transported to a Cairo hospital.</p> <p>\"The shooting continued for three hours causing much panic and fear and then as is always the case things return back to normal as if nothing has happened,\" Sheikh Zuwayed resident and politician Mohamed El-Menei said.</p> <p>The Egyptian military and police has conducted a barrage of attacks and raids on locations in northern Sinai ever since the attack, which saw the removal of the two senior commanders of the Egyptian military as well as the head of intelligence.</p> <p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on a border post that straddled Egypt, Gaza and Israel, conducted during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. The 16 soldiers were killed as they were breaking their daily fast at sunset. The attack caused much embarrassment to the Egyptian military and the newly elected Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi, who used the attack to sweep the entrenched Mubarak generals Hussain Tantawi and Sami Anan from the top two military posts.</p> <p>Sinai has long been a trouble spot even during the regime of ousted president Hosni Mubarak, where residents of the peninsula holding grievances over the heavy-handed security crackdowns carried out by Mubarak's once feared state security apparatus. In the wake of the August attack, the response of the new government and the new military commanders has been more of the same, sweeping crackdowns and raids on unidentified locations and arrests of purported unidentified assailants.</p> <p>\"No one seems to know what's really happening,\" said El-Menei, \"and no one seems to know who security forces are clashing with.\"</p>",
  "<p>The number of homeless families put up by councils in bed and breakfast accommodation has risen by almost half, according to an analysis of official figures. The rise comes after ministers warned 20 councils not to house families in B&amp;Bs for six weeks or more.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Housing Federation</a>, which represents housing associations, found that between January and March 2011 there were 2,750 families nationwide living in B&amp;Bs. In the same period in 2012 this had risen to 3,960, an increase of 44%.</p> <p>The federation also says the number of homeless families is increasing, pushing up demand for \"emergency temporary accommodation\" (B&amp;Bs). In the past two years, the number of households accepted as homeless has risen by 10,000 to 50,290.</p> <p>The problem is acute in inner London, where the government's policy of capping housing benefit has caused thousands of families to approach councils to help cover the shortfall between rent and state subsidies. Westminster council said it now had more than \"1,150 households approach for advice and assistance due to the local housing allowance (LHA) cap. In July, 141 households approached for advice, an increase of 27 on the previous month.\"</p> <p>\"We believe the rise in acceptances is the result of the LHA caps and a high proportion of applications coming from families who are unable to find alternative accommodation, who we are required to accept through homeless legislation,\" the council said.</p> <p>Because of the shortage of affordable properties for low-income people, many are being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/02/tory-borough-move-homeless-away\" title=\"\">exported out of London</a>. According to Westminster, \"in the last month we have secured properties in Hemel Hempstead, Bletchley, Maidstone and Grays\" to house the homeless.</p> <p>The federation says this sort of temporary accommodation is preferable to B&amp;Bs, which lead to poor people having no security of tenure. However, it warned that from April 2013, families living in these homes could be hit by another cap which limits the total amount of benefits paid to households to \u00a3500 a week.</p> <p>\"As [homes in the private rental sector] become more expensive to rent and manage, this could mean families are unable to pay the rent \u2013 pushing them back into B&amp;Bs, or even on to the streets,\" it said.</p> <p>The government has not yet confirmed how the benefit cap will affect people living in temporary accommodation and what measures will be taken to protect the service.David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said: \"In a B&amp;B, whole families can find themselves sharing one room and they are often shut out of their accommodation during the day, causing huge disruption to daily routines of school and work. Every child deserves a decent home to come back to after school, where they feel secure, and where they can sit down to do their homework. That is what temporary accommodation provides.</p> <p>\"Without the safety net of temporary accommodation, thousands more families will find themselves in a vicious cycle of homelessness.</p> <p>\"It is essential that the government puts in place measures to protect this crucial service and the vulnerable families who depend on it.\"</p> <p>Mark Prisk, the Tory housing minister, said: \"There is no excuse for any family to be stuck in bed and breakfast accommodation, and we have offered support to those 20 councils who between them account for 80% of families in this situation for an unacceptably long time.</p> <p>\"We have some of the strongest protections in the world to safeguard people from homelessness, and levels remain lower than in 28 of the last 30 years. Councils have a range of options at their disposal to help anyone facing the threat of losing their home, and to help them further we've increased the discretionary housing pot to about \u00a3400m over the spending period to help families with the transition to the new, fairer system of benefits.\"</p>",

The DNA in mitochondria controls how cells make and use energy, while a person's appearance and other characteristics are influenced by the genetic material locked up in the cell nucleus.</p> <p>Faulty mitochondria can cause a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jun/05/mitochondrial-genetic-disease-ethical-doubts\" title=\"Guardian: 'Three-parent babies' cure for illness raises ethical fear\">wide range of devastating disorders</a> that typically affect the organs and tissues that use most energy, such as the brain, heart and muscles. About one in 200 people carry some form of mitochondrial mutation, and while some of these cause no or only mild disease, others underlie disorders that are progressive and ultimately fatal.</p> <p>Mitochondria are passed down to children only from their mothers, so to avoid harmful mutations being inherited, the new techniques aim to replace the mother's mitochondria with healthy versions from a donor. There are only 37 genes in mitochondria, about 0.2% of our total genetic makeup.</p> <p>In one procedure, called maternal spindle transfer, doctors use standard IVF techniques to collect eggs from the affected woman. They then remove the nucleus from one of her eggs and drop it into a healthy egg from a donor that has had its own nucleus taken out. The new egg, which carries all the mother's chromosomes but the donor's mitochondria, is then fertilised with the father's sperm.</p> <p>The second procedure, called pronuclear transfer, is similar but performed on an early-stage embryo instead of an egg.</p> <p>Through online questionnaires on the authority's website, public meetings in London and Manchester, and opinion polls, the HFEA hopes to gather views on the procedures for a report that will go to Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, in the spring. The consultation runs from Monday until 7 December.</p> <p>\"If this is allowed, and we don't have a view, it has consequences in perpetuity,\" said <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/Lisa-Jardine.html\" title=\"HFEA: Lisa Jardine\">Lisa Jardine</a>, chair of the regulator. \"Once we have genetic modification we have to be damn sure we're happy, because this is not about us, our children, or even our grandchildren, it's about many generations down the line, what the consequences might be.\"</p> <p>The procedures are still being developed in laboratories, notably by <a href=\"http://www.neurone.org.uk/meet-the-teams/the-mitochondrial-research-group/\" title=\"Doug Turnbull\">Doug Turnbull</a> and others at Newcastle University. Any change in the law would allow the treatment in principle, with clinics then requiring permission from the HFEA or another regulatory body.</p> <p>One issue the consultation will ask about is whether a donor should be anonymous, as with blood donation, or contactable by children they contributed DNA to, as is the case with sperm and egg donation. What the procedures mean for the child's sense of identity and the issue of genetic modifications that will run through countless generations will also be explored.</p> <p>\"We want to make a difference to the lives of our patients who live with mitochondrial diseases. These can seriously affect the quality of life of both patients and their families and it often affects several generations. If we can stop that happening, it will be a tremendous help for many hundreds of people who suffer with these diseases,\" said <a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/iah/staff/profile/mary.herbert\" title=\"Newcastle: Mary Herbert\">Mary Herbert</a>, professor of reproductive biology, who works with Turnbull at Newcastle.</p> <p>\"We are now undertaking experiments to test the safety and efficacy of the new techniques and hope that this will inform the HFEA's decision-making process. This work may take three to five years to complete,\" she added.</p>",
  "<p>More people want increased public spending even at the price of higher tax rates, according to the annual <a href=\"http://www.natcen.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Social Attitudes survey</a>. In a possible sign of unease over the recent spending cuts, the number calling for an increase in spending and taxation to strengthen public services rose for the first time in nine years last year.</p> <p>The survey, prepared by the National Centre for Social Research, comes amid a growing feeling in Downing Street that Britain may be embarking on a slow economic recovery. Sir John Major gave voice to this view, only expressed in private by ministers, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/16/economy-darkest-moment-john-major?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">told the BBC on Sunday he hoped Britain had \"passed the darkest moment\"</a>.</p> <p>The former prime minister echoed the views of ministers that the recent negative GDP figures may be inaccurate because employment is growing and industrial production is increasing. But George Osborne may have to embark on a harsher than expected strategy in his autumn statement, by accelerating spending cuts or abandoning his debt target, if the Office for Budget Responsibility confirms that a greater proportion of the lost GDP is permanent, or structural.</p> <p>The chancellor is warned in Monday's British Social Attitudes survey that he will have to tread carefully. The survey found that support for higher spending and higher taxes increased from 31% to 36% between 2010 and 2011. Of those questioned, 55% would like spending to remain at the same level.</p> <p>The survey says: \"This is a modest increase, but it could well be the first sign of a reaction against the public spending reductions that the government has begun to implement, and which are set to accumulate between now and 2017.\"</p> <p>The findings show little support for further cuts. But they also show Osborne may have judged the national mood when he warned in the budget that the slower economic growth means an extra \u00a310bn in welfare cuts to avoid much deeper cuts to health and education. The survey found that 59% believe the government should be mainly responsible for ensuring unemployed people have enough to live on against 88% in 2001.</p> <p>The survey found little support (28%) for the view that the \"government should spend more on welfare benefits even if it leads to higher taxes\". This compares with 58% in 1991.</p> <p>There is little support (15%) for an increase in benefits for unemployed people. But there is strong support an increase in benefits for disabled people who cannot work (53%) and overwhelming support (75%) for an increase in benefits for those who care for sick and disabled people.</p> <p>In a chapter on welfare, the survey's co-director Elizabeth Clery writes: \"While attitudes to different aspects of welfare are behaving in a far from uniform way, they are generally moving in line with the current direction of government policy, rather than responding as they have previously to the onset of recession. We see that the public is becoming less supportive of the government taking a leading role in providing welfare to the unemployed, and even to the elderly in retirement. There is less enthusiasm about public spending on all types of benefits and an increasing belief that the welfare system encourages dependence.\"</p> <p>The survey also found a fall in satisfaction with the NHS from an all-time high of 70% in 2010 to 58% in 2011, the first drop in a decade. The NHS budget has been spared most of the cuts because David Cameron has pledged to ensure that it rises at least in line with inflation. But this is tight compared with the last decade when the NHS budget has risen by between 4% to 5% a year in real terms.</p> <p>Of those questioned, 51% would like a large reduction in immigration levels. A further 24% would like to see immigration reduced modestly.</p> <p>The government responded to the findings by insisting that ministers would continue to stabilise the public finances. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"There is nothing fair about running huge budget deficits and burdening future generations with our debts. If we don't restore sense to the public finances now, the impact on families and businesses will be worse in the long term, with less money to deliver public services in the future. That has meant tough decisions on spending, but the government has taken action to cut out waste and bring the welfare bill under control so that we can prioritise frontline services, such as the NHS, that people rely on.\"</p>",
  "<p>If the future of Wasps is secure, then the role of the man who found the backers and put together the consortium which saved it, remains unresolved. The future of Ken Moss, a former player and once seen as Wasps' chairman-designate, is unclear after his dream of buying the club its own home was put on hold.</p> <p>Moss saw owning their own stadium as a key part of the rescue plan put in place last spring, but on Saturday, after the club had won their first game under new ownership, the current chairman Mark Rigby said they would remain tenants at High Wycombe for at least two years. \"It will certainly be a minimum of two seasons and probably three,\" said Rigby, further confusing the situation regarding Moss, someone he once played alongside.</p> <p>On Friday, when the consortium announced it had finally taken control, it was said that Moss's future was still being \"finalised\". A day later there were suggestions that Moss's job might be done, although the club is still to reveal the identities of its new backers.</p> <p>According to Rigby that will happen \"within weeks\" although he declined to be more precise. \"We have a small group of people who have a belief in the business and the future of the business, but they are back-seat investors,\" said Rigby. \"It's not unusual in business for people to be private about their investments and for the moment they want to remain private while we sort out board structure.\"</p> <p>However, Rigby was less circumspect about the decision to continue as tenants of Wycombe Wanderers. \"Rather than run off on day one and try and find a stadium deal, it would be a insult to the creditors who have supported us through this trading period when money has been very tough,\" he said, adding: \"They believed we would get across the line and then they would get paid. We have to stabilise the integrity of the company before we think of multi-million pound stadium deals. Frankly if I was a creditor I would be insulted if that was the first pronouncement. I'd say 'sort my bill out first please'.\"</p> <p>According to Rigby, the club is still \"haemorraghing\" money and will announce a further \u00a32m loss in its next trading figures. Season ticket sales are down to around 3,000 and the club still has to tie in a shirt sponsor, but after Saturday's performance that could be a deal waiting to happen. After close defeats against Harlequins and Bath, Wasps finally ran away with the game, scoring four tries while coming from behind after half-time. Unsurprisingly, Stephen Jones was named man of the match on debut after taking the game by the scruff of the neck in the second half while completing a perfect kicking display worth 23 points.</p> <p><strong>London Wasps </strong>Southwell (capt); Varndell, Daly, Masi, Wade; Jones, Simpson; Payne (McIntyre, 68), T Rhys Thomas (Lindsay, 45) , Staibano (Taulafo, h-t); Palmer, Wentzel, Launchbury (Haskell, 63), Poff, Johnson (Vunipolo, 64).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Varndell 2, Simpson, Taulafo. <strong>Cons </strong>Jones 4. <strong>Pens</strong> Jones 5.</p> <p><strong>London Irish</strong> Homer; Ojo, Joseph, Tagicakibau, Yarde; Shingler, O'Leary; Lahiff (Aulika, 68), Lawson, Halavatau (Ryan, 9), Skivington (Low, 67), Evans, Danaher (capt), Treviranus, Fisher (Gray, 67).</p> <p><strong>Try </strong>Yarde. <strong>Pens</strong> Shingler 2.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> L Pearce (Devon).</p> <p><strong>Attendance </strong>5,612.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Job:</strong> group chief executive, WPP<br><strong>Age:</strong> 67<br><strong>Industry:</strong> advertising, marketing<br><strong>2011 ranking:</strong> 8</p> <p>WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell admitted that he had \"misjudged the mood of shareholders\" after nearly 60% voted to reject his \u00a36.8m annual pay packet \u2013 topped up with a \u00a35.6m share windfall. It was the largest rebellion at a blue chip company since 90% voted against Sir Fred Goodwin's pension arrangements at Royal Bank of Scotland in 2009.</p> <p>Sorrell still reckons he's worth it, and over the past year WPP cemented its place as the world's biggest marketing services group with its best ever annual results, achieving \u00a31bn profits and \u00a310bn revenues for the first time. WPP is also switching its corporate HQ back to London from Dublin, after changes to UK tax law.</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne can look forward to welcoming WPP back following a shareholder vote in December that will ratify the move.</p> <p>Sorrell shifted WPP's tax domicile to Ireland in 2008 in protest at the prospect of \"double taxation\" of overseas profits \u2013 once abroad and again in the UK \u2013 but new legislation has prompted a return.</p> <p>Never one to rest on his laurels, in June he stunned the advertising industry by buying a majority stake in AKQA, one of the world's most well-known digital agencies and one of the last independent global players, in a deal with an enterprise value of \u00a3348m.</p> <p>Despite a hectic schedule plotting global advertising domination, Sorrell found time to slot in a quick session carrying the Olympic torch through the London borough of Redbridge.</p> <p>The 67-year-old showed a clean pair of heels in a fetching white tracksuit, and with no signs of him slowing down don't mention the words \"succession management\" just yet.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Job:</strong> lord justice of appeal<br><strong>Age:</strong> 63<br><strong>Industry:</strong> law<br><strong>2011 ranking:</strong> 10</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson ranks high again this year with his eagerly awaited report into the culture, practice and ethics of the press due later in 2012. Plucked out of the courtroom by David Cameron, the Liverpool-born judge has had to handle the most high profile and contentious public inquiry into the media since Hutton \u2013 at times showing a sure touch handling the evidence, while at others struggling with presentation and politics.</p> <p>The judge proved fearless in inviting the famous and infamous into his courtroom, beginning with the unexpectedly star-studded lineup of the first week, in which Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and JK Rowling were among those who helped get the inquiry onto the nightly news bulletins.During 97 days of witness hearings spread across eight months and at a cost of nearly \u00a34m, the Leveson inquiry transformed into a standing commission examining a range of controversies \u2013 including Jeremy Hunt's behind the scenes relationship with James Murdoch during News Corporation's bid for BSkyB \u2013 and supplied many moments of low drama, such as when Rebekah Brooks revealed that David Cameron used to sign off texts to her with the acronym \"LOL\".</p> <p>But Leveson often showed irritation with the media, complaining that journalists misunderstood his occasional musings from the chair as indications of his thinking. There were several surprising battles over the reporting of the inquiry, with Paul Staines, AKA Guido Fawkes, and John Mullin, the editor of the Independent on Sunday, after each printed material that partly been based on evidence that leaked out ahead of it being published Leveson's team. And he stood accused of being naive when he sent out a 116-page document of potential criticisms of the media in his final report earlier this month, but insisted that it remain secret and discussion confidential.</p> <p>His biggest test, though, lies ahead. It will be all about what report he chooses to write \u2013 whether he proposes legislation to restrain press excesses. The judge has been quick to argue that the Press Complaints Commission was \"not really a regulator\" but \"a complaints mechanism\" and is exercised by the cost for ordinary individuals who need to seek redress. He argued that he did \"not want to make more work for lawyers\" in the future and insisted that he had to produce a solution that would satisfy \"the public at large\" not just the press. But his worry remains that his report may end up \"on the second shelf of a journalism professor's study\", unread and ignored. The next couple of months will decide just that.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Job:</strong> founder and chief executive, Amazon<br><strong>Age:</strong> 48<br><strong>Industry:</strong> digital media and online retail<br><strong>2011 ranking:</strong> 12</p> <p>Almost 20 years after he launched Amazon in his Seattle garage, Jeff Bezos's fervour to innovate and stay one step ahead of opponents remains undimmed.</p> <p>Earlier this month Bezos unveiled new versions of its best-selling Kindle Fire tablet and e-reader, called Paperwhite (\"thinner than a magazine, lighter than a paperback\"), stealing Apple's thunder ahead of the launch of a rival mini-iPad.</p> <p>Since launching in 1994 the online retail giant has rewritten the rules of traditional bookselling and publishing, and made the decisive move to dominate the wider digital content market with the launch of the first version of the Kindle Fire \"iPad killer\" last autumn.</p> <p>Since then, the Kindle Fire has hoovered up 22% of tablet sales in the US and it was jingle all the way at Christmas with 95% of the 1.3m e-readers sold over the festive period in the UK.</p> <p>Trade title the Bookseller reckons that Amazon controls at least 70% of the UK ebook market, which will be worth an estimated \u00a3500m in 2012, but Bezos's masterplan is to dominate a digital marketplace for content akin to Apple. Bezos is also moving into video on demand (Amazon Prime, LoveFilm), music streaming (Cloud Player) and digital storage (Cloud Drive). The Amazon Prime subscription targets fans of US online film service Netflix. This was underlined earlier this month in a major deal with premium movie channel Epix, which includes titles such as Avengers and Iron Man 2.</p> <p>Sensing the threat of Netflix's international expansion, Bezos moved to take total control of LoveFilm \u2013 Amazon owned a 42% stake since 2008 \u2013 to move the UK business beyond its DVD-by-post roots to streaming video.</p> <p>Netflix arrived in the UK and Ireland in January to find a well-prepared opponent hurriedly sewing up digital rights for movies.</p> <p>Amazon is also waging digital war on the music front, with ambitious and controversial streaming service the Cloud Player, and is not afraid to tackle Google in the digital storage stakes with the Cloud Drive.</p> <p>The 48-year-old has also kept himself busy beyond plotting digital media domination. Bezos and his wife MacKenzie pledged $2.5m to supporters of gay marriage in Washington state, in what is believed to be the largest-ever single donation to the campaign for same-sex unions in the US, after an employee emailed him asking if he might cough up just a 10th of that figure.</p> <p>His other passion is space; he created a private aerospace company called Blue Origin in 2000 with an aim to make space travel more affordable, and earlier this year announced he had found the long-submerged F-1 engines used in the Apollo 11 moon mission. He hopes to raise one or more of the five engines from 4,300m below the Atlantic ocean's surface.</p> <p>Never one to think about slowing down, Bezos is also spending millions to create a clock that is meant to last for 10,000 years in the wilds of west Texas.</p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Downton Abbey series three. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode one.</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/series/downton-abbey-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Viv Groskop's series two blog</a></p> <p>Joy upon joys \u2013 it's spring 1920 and there is to be a wedding at Downton Abbey. Order a boatload of lilies and send Mrs Patmore on a crash course in making canap\u00e9s! Get Sybil and the tediously politically radical chauffeur over from Dublin! Find Edith someone to flirt with in the church so that she doesn't look like a total saddo! No, not that weird old one she was flirting with last series. Someone new. There isn't anyone? Oh, alright, he'll do.</p> <p>With just the right amount of exposition, catching-up and scene-setting, this was a vintage Downton opener, boding well for series three. The postwar aesthetic helps. One glance and you can see the cash they've dropped on hair and wardrobe. <a href=\"http://www.1920-30.com/fashion/hairstyles/marcel-wave.html\" title=\"\">Marcel waves</a> all round, a consignment of crushed velvet that would make Madame Bovary blush and a cornucopia of gothic jet-beading worthy of Lady Gaga's Monster Ball Tour.</p> <p>In theory, this wedding should have been the worst way ever to start a new series. The entire point of Downton Abbey from the very beginning has been The Entail or, in pleb speak, the inheritance. With Matthew and Mary shacked up, the plot has dried up. Or has it?</p> <p>Just in case, as with Shirley MacLaine, you're new to Downton, here's a catch-up. Matthew is Mary's extremely distant cousin. He is the closest male heir. When Lord Grantham dies, the whole estate goes to Matthew. Which is why it was really important that one of the girls married him. This was supposed to be the entire point of series one and two. Although most of the time everyone forgot about it.</p> <p>Anyway, now Mary has married Matthew and Downton is saved. Hooray. But, look! Lord Grantham has gambled away all of his wife's crazyass massive US fortune on the Canadian Trunk Line! And the crazyass American mother-in-law is still spending cash like there's no tomorrow, dripping in ermine, renting top-of-the-range motor cars from Liverpool and demanding goat's milk even though food allergies were not invented until 1987.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bates and Anna are continuing their chaste romance despite the fact that he is in jail for murdering his wife \u2013 can Anna prove it was suicide before Bates commits the actual murder of his annoying cellmate? And the fight to be the most evil continues \u2026 Thomas is no less evil now he is \"Mr Barrow\", the valet; O'Brien has become even more evil now that she has inveigled Alfred, her nephew, into the house. Even Daisy showed signs of becoming evil. Or is that just what class consciousness looks like in Downton Abbey? All in all, a promising first outing. And unlike the cocktails, it wasn't too exciting for so early in the evening.</p> <h2>Random Subplot Alert</h2> <p>All the business with \"Tom\" Branson, the Irish chauffeur turned anti-posh son-in-law, and the spiked drink was slightly mad but came good in the end. Who'd have thought one of Lady Sybil's former suitors would carry around the 1920s equivalent of Rohypnol in his waistcoat pocket? Which also allowed for a lovely twist with Sir Anthony doing a classic, \"I say, chaps, that's not on!\" double take and saving the day, thereby allowing Lady Edith to overlook his geriatric status and inability to reproduce and continue her ill-fated and desperate courtship with him. And let Matthew save the day by making Tom his best man. Which then meant he could take Tom's advice and beg Mary's forgiveness so that the wedding could go ahead. Just thinking about the Venn diagrams Julian Fellowes must have on the walls of his study gives me a headache.</p> <h2>The Golden Eyebrow Award of the Week</h2> <p>This accolade will be awarded to the actor who makes best use of one or more eyebrows during any given episode. The actor with the most Golden Eyebrows at the end of the series will be sent a pair of gilded tweezers. (I will really do this. Please remind me.) Obviously, Dame Maggie will win The Golden Eyebrow Award most weeks. But this week it must go to the left eyebrow of Carson. Truly the butler is back with a vengeance.</p> <p>Carson is the anchor at the head of the downstairs table: \"That treacle tart just hit the spot.\" He is the nemesis Thomas needs: \"We must all be grateful you were not the presiding judge, Mr Barrow \u2026\" He is the real head of the household. The scene where he stood shoulder to shoulder with Lord Grantham, his eyes burning into Lady Mary as she glided down the stairs in her wedding gown, was priceless. If you want a look that settles on just the right side between paternal and creepy, you want Carson's left eyebrow on speed dial.</p> <h2>Surprise Character Development</h2> <p>Lord Grantham can cry! And it was rather beautiful crying. Although the reaction of Cora seemed implausible. She was remarkably understanding about the loss of her entire fortune. But I suppose when you're wearing an absolutely gorgeous peach satin peignoir it's difficult to get too distressed about anything. Still, I wondered if we really bought this development. What's Lord Grantham's back-up plan? Surely he doesn't have one? And without one he is completely doomed. Maybe Isis (the labrador) has the answer. Not enough Isis in this episode.</p> <h2>Sorry, Could You Just Repeat That Rather Awkward Line of Dialogue?</h2> <p>\u2022 Matthew: \"I'm looking forward to all sorts of things.\"</p> <p>Mary: \"Don't make me blush.\"</p> <p>Oh for heaven's sake, just hurry up and get on with it, will you? Or perhaps not. We all know what happened the last time Lady Mary took a man to her bed. The Turkish diplomat with an undiagnosed cardiac condition did not see out the night. RIP Mr Pamuk. Good luck, Matthew.</p> <p>\u2022 Cousin Violet on the temperament of Martha (Shirley MacLaine): \"Was Napoleon overawed by the Bourbons?\" Poor Dame Maggie does have to deliver some obscure lines. We want simple classics. \"What is a weekend?\"</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Grantham upon seeing Lady Mary as a blushing bride: \"I'm so happy I feel my chest will explode.\" Just a couple of things: (a) he is about to lose his entire fortune and livelihood so this was not a very fair line to give him and (b) has anyone ever actually used this expression outside of Tom Cruise on Oprah Winfrey's couch? Huge Bonneville often seems to draw the dialogue short straw.</p> <h2>Next week</h2> <p>\"What's that you're telling me as I sit, powerless, in prison staring at the four walls alongside a cellmate I am tempted to murder? What's that you say? My beloved Downton is to be sold?\" I can't really see what Bates can do about the Crawleys' financial problems from inside the slammer. But, then, he always was a resourceful man. And let's not forget his history with Lord Grantham: they served in the army together and Lord Grantham feels he owes Bates his life. Bates to the rescue again?</p>",

  "<p>A year ago today, a few hundred people went to Wall Street, gathering in the financial district in Lower Manhattan with the intention of staying there until the US noticed. I was lucky to be in Zuccotti Park that first day, with the much more courageous and steadfast Occupiers, who slept out, and planned often truly profound visions for social change.</p> <p>I was just there as a citizen, a baffled ordinary person. I thought that what President Bush had done, what Obama had done, to deal with the financial crisis since 2007-2008 \u2013 the Dodd-Frank regulations, the Financial Inquiry Commission, civil actions and settlements \u2013 had ended as a wink-wink, nod-nod to global financial behemoths. I felt disbelief in seeing that, in the press at least, matters were closed. So I stood outside, and looked for what I could do. But like many others of the rank and file, the non-visionaries, I went home at night. I slept in a warm bed. I worried what America and the world would make of us.</p> <p>Then a kind of miracle occurred. Occupy camps sprang up in every major US city, plus little demonstrations and pickets in every tiny town. Polls showed widespread support, and the press and TV were unexpectedly interested and kind at first, considering how easy we were to make fun of.</p> <p>Once you talked to newcomers at marches and rallies, however, it seemed less surprising. Ordinary Americans were truly strangled by debt \u2013 suffering in immediate ways that rarely made the news \u2013 while we knew that bankrupt institutions had been propped up, with money from our taxes, only to go on foreclosing on soured mortgages and compounding our credit card service fees. Even the business reporters who visited Occupy knew the system was rickety and wildly unfair. The only people who didn't experience it personally, alas, were the wealthy, who controlled national political decisions.</p> <p>Here is a letter from a small town resident in Illinois to a Wall Street executive: \"Our neighbours, with teenagers our children grew up with, are about to be evicted from their house. Their car was repossessed. Their father works in construction, and there hasn't been much of that going on since the real-estate market crashed, which you may remember. Whose fault was that \u2013 his? \u2026 People in your world are doing great (from what we hear, 'great' doesn't begin to describe it), while the rest of us are going down. It is a disaster and cannot continue.\"</p> <p>Within six weeks of the start, many of us began to get nervous that the economic points were getting lost. The direct and obvious message in the protests was increasingly submerged beneath two distractions. One was the endless police violence against the protesters, and the other an obsession with how so many people could live so close together without showers and toilets.</p> <p>You could feel the change occurring: the press started to think the camps were gross. And you could tell that the police were distancing themselves from us, deciding that we were \"them\", not citizens. When, on 26 October 2011, Oakland <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/26/scott-olsen-occupy-oakland-review\" title=\"\">police shot a protester, Scott Olsen</a>, in the head with a tear-gas canister or some other unconventional round, I despaired. Olsen had survived two tours as a marine in Iraq, only to have his skull shattered for exercising freedom of assembly at home. That's it, I thought, that's how non-violent protest ends. You can always pre-empt protest in democracies with sufficient brutality, carefully and stealthily applied, under the guise of crowd control or health and sanitation.</p> <p>That night, in the endless click-trance that bad news induces on the internet, I was passing through sites from different cities' occupations when I landed on an effort called Occupy the Boardroom. This website asked for letters from people who could never go to an Occupy encampment. It collected detailed, forceful messages composed by ordinary citizens directly to named executives of the big six US banks. Its promise was to deliver them, by email, while posting them to \"the mailbag\" so we could all read one another's words.</p> <p>\"The housing crash of 2008 was not an unfortunate accident, rather the fallout from careless gambling and calculated, short-term greed ... I don't expect you to do anything about it. I'd rather you just got out of the way so the rest of the country can start rebuilding. Take your business to Greece or Ireland. Oh wait, you already bankrupted them. I guess the US was just the next target.\"</p> <p>\"Just wanted to give you a pat on the back for collecting over $4,000 from a friend of mine on a Chase credit card with a $500 limit (on which she charged a little bit less than $500 worth of merchandise). It was a great example of innovation in your industry!\"</p> <p>The authors might be struggling to make a living, working at two jobs to save their home, or taking care of an ill or elderly relative. But they supported the protests, and intelligently explained like no source I had ever seen what Americans have experienced at the hands of our banks, and the reasons to speak out.</p> <p>For the 10 months since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/nov/15/occupy-wall-street-zuccotti-eviction-live\" title=\"\">eviction of Zuccotti Park</a>, these letters have given me direction through all the vicissitudes of Occupy. I met the website organisers and asked to use the only skills I have, as a writer and editor, to gather the best ones into a book. A group of volunteers and co-editors read all 8,000 letters. We selected 150. We contacted every author we could find for permission, and have published the letters as <a href=\"http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/the-trouble-is-the-banks-letters-from-ordinary-americans-to-wall-street\" title=\"\">The Trouble is the Banks: Letters to Wall Street</a>. I'm hoping to mail the book to Mitt Romney \u2013 and the president too, of course.</p> <p>People ask me if Occupy will continue, or succeed in anything, if it will change anyone's mind in power. I really have no idea what to answer. For my part, these letters, bound in print, mean that no one can any longer say that they didn't learn what had gone wrong in America, what Occupy arose from, or whether the citizenry supported it; or that they didn't know what solutions citizens clearly wanted, or the profound reasons for our discontent.</p>",
  "<p>The government is poised to give the go-ahead to the first full-scale cull of badgers in England, under a policy that could soon mean as many as 100,000 of the animals \u2013 a third of the national population \u2013 are shot dead by farmers in an attempt to protect cattle from bovine tuberculosis.</p> <p>According to Whitehall sources, the first of two licences is expected to be issued as soon as Monday for a large pilot cull area in Gloucestershire, which is a hotspot for bovine TB.</p> <p>Previously, there have been localised trials to test the science behind such culls. Yet despite the mixed results of the tests, ministers have decided to push ahead with the national scheme after winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/12/activists-disrupt-bager-cull\" title=\"\">an appeal-court battle brought by campaigners</a> last week.</p> <p>In 2011, 26,000 cows were slaughtered because of the disease, which can also be carried by badgers.</p> <p>A decade-long scientific trial of badger culling concluded that such killing could make<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\"> \"no meaningful contribution\", and was \"not an effective way\" to control the disease</a>. But the government is going forward with the plan under intense pressure from British farmers.</p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"We will continue to work with the farming industry so badger control in two pilot areas can start as soon as is practical.\"</p> <p>As yet, no badgers have been killed as part of the cull, but with only straightforward administrative steps required after the granting of the licence, culling could begin within days.</p> <p>Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is a fervent supporter of the cull, having tabled a record 600 parliamentary questions on the issue while serving as environment spokesman in opposition.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/business/business-news/no-more-%E2%80%98clueless-urbanites%E2%80%99-in-defra-just-a-focus-on-reviving-rural-economy/49669.article\" title=\"\">interview with the Farmers Guardian</a> on Friday, Patterson appeared to cast the proposed cull as being of benefit to badgers: \"I find the attitude of those who want these wonderful animals to die of this disgusting disease [bovine TB] completely incomprehensible.\"</p> <p>But Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, said: \"The cull will cost more than it saves, put a huge strain on the police, and will spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers are disturbed by the shooting. Ministers should listen to the scientists and can this cull \u2013 which is bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.\"</p> <p>A source in Paterson's department said the controversial policy was causing great anxiety: \"The panic among senior officials outweighs anything since foot and mouth. It makes The Thick of It look tame and gentle.\"</p> <p>The government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/25/badger-cull-high-court-challenge\" title=\"\">refused to release numerous documents under freedom of information rules</a>, including advice from the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, and communication with the National Farmers Union. The latter was blocked on the grounds that it was \"internal communication\".</p> <p>Natural England, the licensing body, said: \"We are working flat out with licence applicants on processing their applications. We will issue licences to enable control activity to commence in the pilot areas as soon as is possible.\"</p> <p>The licence will be issued to a group of farmers and landowners who will commit to killing at least 70% of the badgers on their land for at least four years in a row.</p> <p>The government's own impact assessment concluded that it would cost farmers more to carry out the cull than to do nothing and suffer any losses from bovine TB.</p> <p>The licence area must also have \"hard boundaries\", such as rivers, to prevent badgers fleeing and potentially spreading the disease and making the situation worse.</p> <p>The government pointed to the 16% cut in bovine TB found at the end of the 10-year trial but the new culls will use a different killing method. Instead of trapping then shooting \u2013 considered expensive \u2013 the badgers will be \"free shot\" by marksmen. The deaths have to occur before 1 February, when the close season for badger shooting begins and runs till 31 May.</p> <p>But the start of the cull could be halted by a legal challenge to the licence. The Badger Trust, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/badger-cull-legal-challenge-fails\" title=\"\">unsuccessfully challenged the government's cull policy</a> in the appeal court last week, stated: \"We will continue to pursue all legal means to stop culling. We will closely study any licences issued by Natural England.\" The trust was successful in a previous legal action against badger culling in Wales. Campaigners are also pursuing a complaint against the government in Europe under the Bern convention, which governs wildlife and habitat protection.</p> <p>A licence for a cull in Somerset is thought to be taking longer to process due to a legal issue involving the crown estate, but sources said they did not expect that to prevent the licence being granted in due course.</p> <p>Animal rights campaigners are determined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/12/activists-disrupt-bager-cull\" title=\"\">to halt the trials</a> through protests at the cull sites, whose location is not being made public. Volunteers plan to patrol the zones and stop the badgers coming into the open.</p> <p>The Gloucestershire and Somerset culls are trials meant to test whether free shooting is as effective as trapping and shooting.</p> <p>Critics say the short time of the trials will be insufficient for comparison with the decade-long trial, but if the government calls the trials a success, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/19/badger-cull-bovine-tb-spelman\" title=\"\">killing will happen across affected areas in England</a> and is expected to end the lives of 70,000 to 105,000 badgers \u2013 from an entire UK population estimated at 300,000.</p> <p>A badger vaccination plan is replacing the Welsh cull. Vaccination is also being tested in Devon by the National Trust, and by the Wildlife Trust in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>The last Labour government said an oral badger vaccine would be ready by 2015. The coalition cancelled five of six trials of injectable vaccines, and said a viable oral vaccine was \"years away\".</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for reporting Lord Adonis's rewriting of history, though rightly qualified by the description \"a blazing polemic\" in Martin Kettle's article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/12/adonis-plan-for-state-schools\" title=\"\">Adonis has a plan for schools, and you may find you like it</a>, 13 September). Certainly, the school system has been \"reinvented\", but not in the way Adonis would have us believe. \"Independent state schools\". Really? When under direct contract to an all-powerful secretary of state with minimum parliamentary accountability, thereby creating the most politically centralised system in western Europe since Germany in the 1930s? \"Comprehensives based on the old secondary moderns\". Really? Certainly not the ones my children went to \u2013 where, as in so many others, they were inspired to work hard for university and higher qualifications. \"Academy results are still improving at 8% a year\". Really? Not when the GCSE \"equivalents\" are now replaced by the more \"academically rigorous\" six-subject Ebacc \u2013 and no more than the many comprehensives that have resisted \"forced conversion\". \"Academies and free schools are boosting innovation\". Really? Any more so than the many comprehensives have managed, despite the constraints of a national curriculum from which academies and free schools have been liberated?<br><strong>Professor Richard Pring</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Martin Kettle is right to call for a focus on facts, but the facts show little backing for academies. The school-by-school data released by the DfE earlier this year showed that, when you compare similar schools, non-academies perform at least as well as academies. It is true that, for academies below the 35% benchmark (for five GCSEs including English and maths), results grew by 8% last year. But results at non-academies below the benchmark also grew by 8%. And they made far less use of the GCSE equivalents (such as BTecs) that Michael Gove so scorns.</p> <p>Some local authorities responded to underperformance through the academy route. Others chose direct support and intervention. Despite the greater funding of the academy route, the data shows the non-academy route has been as successful. Real school improvement is not down to structure. It is down to factors such as effective leadership, high expectations and great teaching. And those are needed whatever the nature of the school.<br><strong>Henry Stewart and Melissa Benn</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Local Schools Network</em></a></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Comprehensive schools have coped remarkably well for many years with very disadvantaged and disruptive children, children whose English language skills are weak and with social dislocation. A government keen to promote equal opportunities would enable comprehensive schools serving the most demanding catchments to work with smaller classes (16 pupils rather than 26?) with the support of learning assistants. This would improve social and academic outcomes greatly.</p> <p>The academy programme is in its infancy. The claim that it is \"clearly successful\" is wildly premature. The story I hear is vastly different: mass exodus of staff, mass expulsions of awkward pupils, governors living far from the school, diminution of teachers' rights, little or no local accountability. The demise of local education authorities, the direct consequence of the academies programme, means there will shortly be no teams to provide management and teaching advice, training, collaboration across schools and phases: critical, continuous, professional, trusted support. Academies will be faced, before long, with diminishing funds and increasing isolation. <br><strong>David Curtis</strong><br><em>Solihull, West Midlands</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Adonis, and his successor, Michael Gove, claim their academies programme is about social justice. Yet last week the OECD reported that schools in the UK are <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/educationspendingrisingbutaccesstohighereducationremainsunequalinmostcountriessaysoecd.htm\" title=\"\">\"among the most socially segregated in the developed world\"</a>. Adonis and Gove believe they are on a heroic mission to save education but, with such meagre returns after 10 years, isn't it time they started to look facts in the face?<br><strong>Alasdair Smith</strong><br><em>Anti Academies Alliance</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Academies are not independent. They are created by, wholly dependent for their annual funding on and subject to terminable contracts with the secretary of state. And academies are state schools only if that minister is, like Louis XIV, taken to be the state. <br><strong>Peter Newsam</strong><br><em>Thornton Dale, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Mr Kettle implies there is a direct relationship between the perceived evils of local authority control and the alleged failure of the comprehensive system. If there was a failure it was indeed one of vision, but one across the whole educational system, local and national, among educationists and politicians. That is not in itself a justification for divorcing schools from the local democratic process and effectively centralising a major tranche of government spending.<br><strong>Steve Healey</strong><br><em>Brighton, Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008If academies and free schools are so good, why are they not being introduced across the board? Could it be that their \"success\" is based on selection, funding or facilities that are not, and never can be, available to all?<br><strong>Michael Leigh</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008A key element of successful schools may be the selection of able children of pushy parents. In its own interest, why would a good free school or academy in a small town like mine not select able children with two-Jag parents able to drive them in from elsewhere? Can Martin Kettle tell me how children on a deprived estate, who might then require education in another town, would be advantaged by a school day lengthened by two hours on a bus?<br><strong>Philip Kerridge</strong> <br><em>Bodmin, Cornwall </em></p>",
  "<p>Time for a reality check, says Maxie Hayles, ploughing through rice and curried mutton. We may all have cheered for Mo Farah and the melting-pot contingent in Team GB. But we've not&#xa0;yet reached Martin Luther King's promised land. Still too much racism, too much institutional racism, he says. Policy-makers talk \"post-racial\". Maxie's having none of it. \"It's a fallacy; nonsense. There is an agenda to keep race on the back burner because race is unpleasant to deal with. But it is there.\"</p> <p>There's a trace of bitterness and that's understandable. For 23 years Maxie, 67, was the face of the <a href=\"http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/end-era-birmingham-racial-attacks-monitoring-unit\" title=\"\">Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit</a> (Bramu). Two weeks ago, after many years on the financial precipice, the organisation, bowed to the inevitable and wound itself up. An unsatisfactory, unwanted end to an institution feted in its time by governments, the great and the good and icons in the field such as Jesse Jackson. And yet, inevitable.</p> <p>Bramu was one of the independent monitoring groups set up in the 1980s, a decade scarred by riots, racial attacks and decades of hostility between the police, statutory authorities and minority communities. The authorities identified as perpetrators of racial discrimination were often the ones funding the groups pointing the finger. That seemed to suggest that even they knew they needed holding to account.</p> <p>But that was then. Over time, race relations have improved and institutions no longer feel the need to be held to specific account on the issue of racism. They certainly feel less inclined to fund those such as Maxie who might do that.</p> <p>The public money goes to bodies that \u2013 like the equalities commission \u2013 seek to address discrimination across all the strands: race, gender, disability, religion, sexuality. Bramu did host a high-profile \"hate crime\" conference in 2010. But without a dramatic rebrand, it was swimming against the tide.</p> <p>\"We dealt with 6,000 cases, 30,000 inquiries,\" Maxie says. \"When the funding stopped, we had 120 live cases.\" He lays down his fork to show me hate crime stats, with race by far the biggest component. \"Any group in this field has to prioritise race.\"</p> <p>But that was then, and the future, as seen by those who hold the purse strings \u2013 Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem \u2013 is indeed post-racial. Inevitable. A tide that strong sweeps everything in its way.</p>",
  "<p>I am sitting staring at a computer screen. So far so banal, except that this screen features a red dot that, by some technological magic, tracks the movement of my eyes: I can place it where I want on the screen just by looking. The bottom of the screen portrays a keyboard, although I could, if I chose, select other screens made up of various vocabulary, grammar and expression-based menus, which, for experienced users, would doubtless speed things up.</p> <p>Because this is painstaking. I look at&#xa0;a letter, and the red dot sits on it. I&#xa0;continue staring, and the dot blinks, twice. The letter then pops up at the top of the screen. I move on to the next letter (or, more often, the backspace).</p> <p>It gets easier: there's predictive text, like on a mobile phone, so I stare at the word I want, which gets added to my sentence. Eventually, the phrase is complete. I stare at it and it blinks. \"What an amazing machine,\" says a cool, synthesised voice. \"Rather let down by its user.\"</p> <p>This is eye-gaze technology, at the leading edge of a fast-evolving and \u2013 for those who need it \u2013 vital field known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication\" title=\"\">augmentative and alternative communication</a> (AAC), plus the closely related assistive technology (AT). Without it, we would have been denied access to the remarkable mind of Professor Stephen Hawking (not to mention his starring role at the Paralympics opening ceremony). Nor would the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/22/tony-nicklinson-right-to-die-case\" title=\"\">locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson</a> have been able to express so memorably \u2013 using eye-gaze \u2013 his despair at being refused the right to an assisted suicide. Hawking, with characteristic elegance, summarises its value: \"Even more important than the freedom of speech is the freedom to speak.\"</p> <p>Most of us know nothing about it. Worse, says Anna Reeves of the <a href=\"http://www.ace-north.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ACE Centre</a>, a national charity that provides independent AAC assessments, advice and training, \"a lot of people who need it have real trouble getting it. The funding's a mess. It falls between education and health, and most local authorities don't have specific budgets for it.\"</p> <p>Yet AAC can be life-changing. Alan Martin, who developed cerebral palsy as an infant, was 31 before friends clubbed together to buy his first communication aid. \"Before that,\" he explains in one of several pre-recorded messages he can activate on his current machine, \"I relied on facial expressions and gestures. It was very frustrating.\"</p> <p>Jovial and instantly engaging, Martin now runs his own company, <a href=\"http://www.mouseonthemove.co.uk\" title=\"\">Mouse on the Move</a>, providing inclusive dance workshops for people with disabilities. To talk, and teach, he uses a wheelchair-mounted portable computer. He has reasonable control of his right arm, so uses a finger to press symbols on the screen that open up successive folders of images, words and frequently used phrases. He can also send emails and \u2013 an exciting new addition \u2013 text messages through a mobile phone connected to his computer. The whole system, Reeves says, cost around \u00a38,000, and is in the middle of a spectrum of more than 100 different kinds of communication aids. (\"Rubbish,\" says Martin succinctly, when asked what he thought of his first device.)</p> <p>At one end are simple picture books and communication boards from which users select letters, words, phrases, pictures or symbols to communicate their message. Simple electronic devices contain digitised speech messages pre-recorded by a family member or carer and activated by a big button. More sophisticated boards hold up to 32&#xa0;symbols and attached messages.</p> <p>But helpful as these devices are, they are limited to pre-set messages. Computer-generated speech lets users say what they want to say. A portable machine called <a href=\"http://www.toby-churchill.com/content/lightwriters-0\" title=\"\">the Lightwriter</a> has existed since the 1970s, allowing people who can type to display messages on a screen and also speak synthetically. More recently, says Reeves, \"we've seen some great apps being developed for iPads and the like. If they work for you, they're brilliant. Especially for kids, because they're cool.\"</p> <p>One, <a href=\" http://www.assistiveware.com/product/proloquo2go\" title=\"\">Proloquo2Go</a>, even features a couple of authentic British children's voices, as well as \"sad\" and \"happy\" versions of the same voice; until recently synthesised speech robbed users of accent, emotion and intonation. Alan, who was born on Merseyside and is a huge Liverpool fan, would love to be able to speak scouse.</p> <p>At the top end are the systems used by Martin, Nicklinson and Hawking: fully functioning computers, controlled in any number of ingenious ways. Hawking now uses a muscle in his cheek; another system moves the mouse through minuscule lip movement. These systems are capable of emailing, texting and even opening doors, turning on lights and operating the telly.</p> <p>There are, Reeves says, perhaps 260,000 people in Britain using AAC equipment, about 10% of them using this kind of hi-tech aid. Their conditions range from serious physical and learning disabilities through sensory impairment to autism, motor neurone disease, stroke and, commonly, cerebral palsy. \"There are also many who are undiagnosed, who simply present to us with an inability to communicate,\" she says. \"It's far more common than people think.\"</p> <p>Formed this summer by the merger of two separate charities to develop what would be, astonishingly, Britain's first national AAC/AT service, the ACE Centre holds open information days, carries out in-depth needs assessments on individuals, and advises and trains children and adults with AAC needs as well as teachers and carers.</p> <p>But it doesn't have the money to provide actual aids for any longer than a short test period.

  "<p>Nobody, but nobody, would choose this as the moment to demand repeal of the Freedom of Information Act. If the Hillsborough cover-up has demonstrated one thing, it is that unaccountable power corrupts; the light thrown in by FoI helped expose the facts as well as this insight, 23 years on from the tragedy. The sole comfort with this conspiracy is the hope that the culture has since altered sufficiently that even bent cops would now think twice about abusing their authority so blatantly.</p> <p>That solace, however, is hard to sustain when a new veil of secrecy is about to be thrown over another element of state power. Just as the police have (half) learned to live in a more open culture, the government is giving the security services and allied bureaucrats an unprecedented licence to switch off the lights in open court. After revelations about MI5's knowledge of American torture emerged in the case of Binyam Mohamed \u2013 revelations that the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8538410.stm\" title=\"\">master of the rolls decided</a> were embarrassing as opposed to dangerous \u2013 the state's supreme secret operatives set to work on the proposals that have become <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/justiceandsecurity.html\" title=\"\">the justice and security bill</a>. It is back in the House of Lords next month, and it is decision time for the Liberal Democrats. Next week their conference must decide whether to back Jo Shaw's amendment demanding a rethink from first principles, or whether instead to acquiesce in an inherently illiberal law in return for the sort of mushy and unworkable compromises that Gordon Brown once offered on 42 days.</p> <p>Sloppily drafted, <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf\" title=\"\">the original proposals</a> came in what Kenneth Clarke conceded was a \"very green paper\", but were nonetheless immediately rushed into a bill, with the white paper stage being skipped. The most notable concession was the removal of inquests from the sweeping scope of a scheme that covers civil litigation of all other stripes, but now <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldselect/ldconst/18/18.pdf\" title=\"\">the Lords constitutional committee</a> has warned of the possibility of the executive reversing even this at some future point, by exploiting a so-called Henry VIII power that is written into the bill to allow ministers to revise its terms. The whole process has had the smack of precisely the sort of arrogance that the bill would keep hidden in future. And it is no longer in the hands of the instinctively liberal Mr Clarke, but instead of his replacement as justice secretary, Chris Grayling \u2013 a man who said he would like to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/06/conservatives.humanrights\" title=\"\">tear up the Human Rights Act</a>.</p> <p>Ministers insist that no currently admissible evidence will be rendered secret, but that is doubly misleading. For one thing it assumes \u2013 against all expectation \u2013 that the judges who currently wield the black marker pen under the public interest immunity (PII) system are as gung-ho with it as the executive will be if it succeeds in usurping this power under the bill. For another, it misses the point \u2013 information kept out of court under PII is put beyond the reach of both sides; closed hearings, by contrast, are expressly designed to free the authorities to exploit information that the other side is barred from seeing. That unbalances the scales of an adversarial system whose great merit is allowing the material marshalled by either side to be tested \u2013 if need be, to destruction \u2013 by the other, and also undermines a principle of open justice that has been embodied in the common law since the fall of the Stuarts.</p> <p>The Lib Dem leadership plans to muddle through by hinting at compromises to extend notional judicial discretion. No such compromise can cohere, since \u2013 like a referee with only one team on the pitch \u2013 the judge will still be ruling on material that one side is unable to test. The party must consider whether it really wants a rerun of Nick Clegg's messy handling of health reforms, which even friends now admit he should have killed, or whether instead it would be better to force a clean break. Underlying the political judgment is the principle. With its genesis in torture cases that shamed the authorities, the grim sort of things this bill could keep secret are apparent. Who knows what horrors might emerge 23 years from now to blight the conscience of anyone who acquiesces in its passage.</p>",

  "<p>A little over two weeks after he signed for the club, Hugo Lloris finally discovered what it feels like to be a Tottenham player. He would have enjoyed the conditions on a warm, still afternoon in Berkshire \u2013 and seeing his new side record their first win of the season \u2013 but little else will have been to the Frenchman's liking as he remained rooted to the bench, out of sight and, as far as his manager is concerned, out of&#xa0;mind.</p> <p>Going into this contest, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas had reiterated that for the time being, and until injury or loss of form forced him to think otherwise, Brad Friedel would remain his first-choice goalkeeper. Watching on, Lloris could have taken little comfort or hope from seeing the American put in another assured performance and come within a few minutes of keeping his first clean sheet of the season.</p> <p>This was Friedel's 307th consecutive appearance in the Premier League \u2013 he appears certain to make it 308 when Queens Park Rangers visit White Hart Lane in six days' time. The situation is an intriguing one. Having signed the captain of France, and a man regarded as being one of the finest goalkeepers in the world, it was expected that Villas-Boas would thrust Lloris straight into his starting XI. He made clear, however, after Spurs's 1-1 draw with Norwich on 1 September, and 24 hours after Lloris had completed his \u00a312m move from Lyon, that there would be no immediate&#xa0;change.</p> <p>With players then departing for international duty, it fell to Didier Deschamps, the France manager, to declare that Lloris \"has not appreciated the statement of his coach\", with the player expressing his dissatisfaction personally soon after.</p> <p>This was all taken to be another example of Villas-Boas's lack of man-management skills, the trait which did for him at Chelsea. Looked at another way, however, and it could be deemed as proof that the Portuguese had learnt from his torment at Stamford Bridge and instead of having favourites, would now reward players on their performances alone. On that basis, Friedel deserves his place.</p> <p>The 41-year-old was excellent against Norwich, and while hardly troubled against a generally toothless Reading side here, he displayed the calm and confidence that persuaded Harry Redknapp to sign him on a free transfer from Aston Villa in July 2011.</p> <p>He plucked crosses out of the sky with ease, marshalled the four defenders ahead of him with authority, and, barring one clearance on 38 minutes that landed straight at the feet of Garath McCleary, cleared danger from the Spurs's area with little fuss.</p> <p>It should be reiterated, however, that he was facing a Reading side who, 25 days after their last league match \u2013 a 4-2 defeat at Chelsea \u2013 appeared well short of attacking guile. Brian McDermott made the decision to maintain Pavel Pogrebnyak as a lone striker, but with the Russian receiving little or no help from midfield, the hosts were a blunt force for the majority of this contest.</p> <p>Neither did it help that the bulk of their free-kicks, which should have caused Spurs problems given they were being delivered by Danny Guthrie and Ian Harte, drifted high, wide or both. Some credit should also be given to the Spurs central defenders, Jan Vertonghen and William Gallas, who generally kept their positions well and, more often than not, timed their tackles and blocks perfectly.</p> <p>Indeed, the one time Friedel was left wanting, drifting out of position to leave Adam Le Fondre with an effort at an open goal, Gallas made a decisive goal-line clearance. Reading did eventually score, with Hal Robson-Kanu striking late on as Tottenham's defence, for once, left their goalkeeper exposed.</p> <p>It was reward for a more energetic second-half display from the home side but, overall, Spurs were in total control. As was their goalkeeper. Lloris has more waiting to come.</p>",
  "<p>At the moment, I am trying to avoid thinking about John Cage. And instead, I find myself thinking about Ant &amp; Dec. In 2009, the musicians Steve Beresford and Tania Chen asked me to supply the spoken part for a performance of <a href=\"http://www.lcdf.org/indeterminacy/\" title=\"\">Indeterminacy</a>, by the postwar avant-garde giant John Cage. My shelves creak with music, but I&#xa0;didn't know any Cage, beyond Sonic Youth's interpretation of his piece <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEEV4bIXv5s\" title=\"\">Six</a> on their Goodbye 20th Century album. As ever, I access the Temple of Culture by the tradesmen's entrance.</p> <p>Highbrow musicologists would scoff at this lowbrow lead in to Cage's oeuvre. But, in her 1975 tome Sword of Wisdom, the celebrated mystic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithell_Colquhoun\" title=\"\">Ithell Colquhoun</a> recalls discovering the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn\" title=\"\">Order of the Golden Dawn</a> in 1923 as \"a schoolgirl sitting on a lavatory-seat and leaning forward to see into&#xa0;the depths of an osier basket lined with newspapers\", specifically an occult expose from the Daily Express. In a piece of synchronicity worthy of Cage, I discovered this while reading Sword of Wisdom on my toilet, near to which I&#xa0;keep all my occult books, as I find they have laxative properties.</p> <p>Cage's Indeterminacy is currently available as a cardboard box of 90 cards of 90 stories of different lengths, and a leaflet of instructions: \"Read the stories aloud, with or without accompaniment, paced so that each takes one minute. A stop-watch or watch with a second hand will help keep time. Read all 90 stories in order or select a smaller number, using chance procedures or not.\" Beresford and Chen elect to improvise on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_piano\" title=\"\">prepared pianos</a> and found objects while I read Cage's stories in random order, and we all do our best to ignore each other, an approach that has made all the eight performances we have given in the last two years unique, though it's inappropriate to take any personal pride in this, as we are merely Cage's zombie puppets.</p> <p>Indeterminacy's instructions advise reading \"conversationally, naturally, and neutrally. Cage's own reading is resolutely undramatic.\" Early in this ongoing project (we have a three-date \"tour of London\" next week, for example), I&#xa0;resolved to find out as little about Cage as&#xa0;I could, so that I didn't \"interpret\" the stories, or do an impression of what I imagined his performance would be like. I&#xa0;didn't&#xa0;even check the pronunciations of any of the place names, people, or the many species of mushroom mentioned in the stories, assuming my ignorance exemplified Cageian chance procedure. But suddenly, like a delusional believer seeing affirming signs wherever he looks \u2013 images of Jesus on burned toast, the face of David Icke in&#xa0;a&#xa0;soiled nappy \u2013 I was encountering Cage everywhere.</p> <p>When we performed in Bexhill-on-Sea, the pavilion hosted a Cage exhibition, which I walked through cowed, following Beresford's calves to the restaurant for the hearty meal he insists on consuming before so much as looking at a table of&#xa0;children's toys and vintage melodicas. The trombonist Alan Tomlinson, who is performing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2diY6wC1Xs4\" title=\"\">Cage's Solo for Sliding Trombone</a> alongside us, told me Cage sought comedy brass advice from Spike Jones and His City Slickers, suggesting, if not something so common as a sense of humour, then at least a sense of the absurd. After an Indeterminacy in Bristol, the Welsh magus <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/clarkgwent\" title=\"\">Carlton B Morgan</a> told me he overheard Cage discussing garlic bread in a Pizza Hut in Huddersfield in 1989. And at a party last week, the punk film-maker <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Bendel\" title=\"\">Graham Bendel</a> not only told me he had once invited Cage to dinner, but did an unsolicited impression of him, sounding like a macrobiotic Woody Allen, insisting he could only eat \"beans and pulses, just beans and pulses if you don't mind, boys\".</p> <p>None of this was remotely helpful. Then I remembered. In 2001, I was invited by ITV to pitch Ant and Dec a sitcom idea. I suggested the pair should play bickering lighthouse keepers on a lonely rock. Each week a supply boat, rowed by Cat Deeley, would deliver a different MacGuffin, an object to drive that show's plot. But the Byker boys chose instead to pilot a remake of Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads, specifically the episode No Hiding Place, in which they try to avoid hearing the results of a soon to be televised football match. In the shadow of Cage, I find myself wondering if it is too late to pitch Ant and Dec a new sitcom.</p> <p>In Anthony M and Declan D: New Departures, the duo play freelance interpreters of time-based art pieces, who live in a lighthouse on a lonely rock. In the pilot episode, Queer Silence, they are commissioned to perform Cage's Indeterminacy and spend the days prior to the event avoiding forming an opinion about the composer, a decision threatened by Cat Deeley, who rows around the island doing an impression of Cage through a megaphone. \"Beans and pulses, just beans and pulses if you don't mind, boys.\"</p> <p>When I sit down next to Beresford and Chen next week with my cards and my clock, I will block Bendel's Woody Allen voice, and Morgan's garlic bread, and think instead of Ant and Dec, two voids meeting in empty oblivion, bulldozers of negative space, leaving my mind clear for Indeterminacy. Eleven years later, that failed sitcom pitch belatedly has a higher purpose. But if the boys are interested, the offer remains open.</p> <p><em>Indeterminacy is at London's </em><a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk/whats-on/john-cage-indeterminacy/\" title=\"\"><em>Battersea Arts Centre</em></a><em> on 23 September, </em><a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on-book-tickets/music/john-cage-indeterminacy\" title=\"\"><em>Kings Place</em></a><em> on 24 September and </em><a href=\"http://www.cafeoto.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Caf\u00e9 Oto</em></a><em> on 25 September.</em></p>",

This means that neither the zoo where the panda sneezed, nor Fenton's owner, will see a penny of the profits. So yes, there is money to be made from filming your pet being cute.

  "<p>Finally, the lineup for the US presidential election in November has been decided: the Republicans have nominated John Kerry and his running mate Chris Van Hollen, who will go head-to-head against the White House incumbent Rob Portman and his vice-president Ted Olson.</p> <p>The four men are indeed the 2012 presidential candidates, though they are taking on the roles more as actors than as politicians.

Ted Olson, who held the post of solicitor general under George Bush, will wear the shoes of Joe Biden in preparatory sessions with the real Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>He joins Rob Portman, who plays Obama as Romney's sparring partner; Kerry who conversely plays Romney in mock debating sessions with Obama; and Van Hollen who has been given the role of Ryan as Biden prepares for the debates.</p> <p>Since the first dramatic TV debate in September 1960, in which Richard Nixon put forward a disastrously sweaty performance against John F Kennedy, the importance of preparing for the events has grown into an entire industry.</p> <p>The role of sparring partner has grown in importance by equal measure, and the role is now taken very seriously indeed \u2013 even more so this year in a tightly fought race when so much is potentially riding on the debates.</p> <p>A good debating partner will help the real candidates hone their messages and avoid nasty surprises. Portman, who is recognised as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/rob-portman-obama-romney-debate\">a leading exponent of the art</a>, spends hours preparing himself for the role, watching videos of the politicians he is playing over and over until he knows their every policy position as intimately as their mannerisms.</p> <p>Such is the exacting nature of the work \u2013 which involves a capacity to memorise enormous amounts of policy detail combined with skills as a debater and performer \u2013 it is no surprise that three of the four are legally trained.</p> <p>Olson has presented 58 cases before the US supreme court including the highly controversial Bush v Gore in 2000 which handed the election to Bush even though he lost the popular vote.</p> <p>Portman practiced in commercial law, and Kerry was a prosecutor in Massachusetts. Van Hollen is the odd one out: though he has no legal experience, his value to Biden is that he is knows Paul Ryan's foibles inside out.</p> <p>A Democratic representative for a district of Maryland in the US Congress, Van Hollen has has the chance to study Ryan at close quarters for years.

  "<p>The government is threatening to block the disclosure of emails that reveal who removed key sections from a letter that exonerated Lord Prescott of false claims that he had used a government credit card for \"cavalier\" spending.</p> <p>Despite a ruling from the information commissioner that the details be released this week, ministers may prevent the release of emails between the Cabinet Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government. Ministers are contemplating a defence under section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act that release of the emails may prejudice the \"effective conduct of public affairs\" or \"collective cabinet responsibility\".</p> <p>The emails centre on unfounded claims by the Tory co-chairman Grant Shapps, who was then a housing minister, that the former deputy prime minister's \"private office\" had spent \u00a32,000 on Whitehall credit cards, supposedly including a trip to an Australian casino. In fact the spending was entirely legitimate. The only untoward items were due to the government-issued credit card having been cloned.</p> <p>The letter from the head of the civil service, Gus O'Donnell, clearing Prescott was altered, with a key paragraph \u2013 apologising to the Labour peer Prescott for not warning him that information was being released \u2013 removed.O'Donnell's signature was apparently forged. The warning procedure allows former ministers to prepare a response to allegations raised about them in parliament.</p> <p>Without this notice, Tory MPs were able to put down parliamentary questions and ambush Prescott. It led to a <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3897514/Prescott-staff-spent-taxpayers-cash-at-casino.html\" title=\"\">spate of newspaper stories</a> conveying the impression that Prescott had enjoyed hospitality at the taxpayers' expense when he was deputy prime minister. Shapps, now Tory chairman, claimed: \"Prezza seems to have a cavalier attitude to the public purse.\"</p> <p>Prescott claims the questions about spending on Whitehall credit cards during his time in office were part of a Tory campaign to scupper his chances of becoming a police commissioner.</p> <p>He and Hilary Benn, Labour's frontbench spokesman on local government, have issued a series of freedom of information requests that have seen both the Cabinet Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government stall over the release of the key emails. Prescott said: \"It is absolutely staggering Grant Shapps's former department redacted a cabinet secretary's letter without his permission and is now covering up whodunnit.</p> <p>\"This government is trying to protect the identity of the person responsible by using a ministerial veto clause to say it's not in the public interest. This from a government that claims a commitment to greater transparency. I know from the Cabinet Office that they have the answers as to who gave the order to change the cabinet secretary's letter. They must publish now.\"</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said: \"We believe that some of the information held is covered by section 36 and extra time is needed in order to make a determination whether the public interest is best served by releasing this information or not.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the communities department said: \"We have not currently issued a section 36 exemption order. We will be writing to Lord Prescott in due course.\"</p> <p>In answer to a parliamentary question on the matter, Lord Wallace, a government whip, told the Lords the missing paragraphs in the letter had been deleted in administrative error and that the cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood, had written to Prescott to \"explain the background\".</p> <p>In a separate development it emerged on Sunday that the website founded by Shapps which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/15/labour-probe-grant-shapps-company\" title=\"\">Labour called for an investigation into last week </a>over allegations of copyright violation and fraud has been taken down from the internet.</p>",

I owed it to her and womankind to celebrate her recovery by writing her biography.</p> <p>As I began my research \u2013 I cannot recommend the findings of Dr Pfaus's MRI scans of the cervix too highly \u2013 I began to make some remarkable discoveries. A vagina that is neglected can easily fall into a deep depression; indeed, I encountered several that had self-sealed in an act of suicide. Meanwhile, a pampered vagina is capable of acts of great creativity. It is a little-known fact that Edith Wharton wrote the House of Mirth with her clitoris. And while it is true that the vagina may sometimes become addicted to her own happiness, this is something society ought to celebrate, rather than control with a strict 12-step programme that insists on submission to a male God.</p> <p>Throughout history, men have sought to subjugate the vagina through whatever means they have available and as Dr Nancy Fish, whose luscious auburn curls cascade dreamily over her angular shoulders, points out in her seminal work, The Vagina Songbook: \"The Delta Blues actually originated from the Venus Delta, as women began to protest at 'Waking up in the morning/ With a penis in my bed'.\"</p> <p>I had experience of this directly when a male friend, whom I shall call Neanderthal, offered to host a party in celebration of my vagina. \"I've made some vulva-shaped pasta that I've named cuntini,\" he laughed. I gasped as I noticed he was also serving champagne out of deliberately phallicised bottles and had not even had enough respect to circumcise the sausages. My vagina went into a three-year spasm during which I was unable to do anything except write to Ban Ki Moon and insist that verbal insults to the vagina be considered a war crime.</p> <p>To say I was astounded by the degree to which the Goddess Array (as I now choose to call my vagina) reacts to oppression is an understatement, not least when I conducted my own experiment on mice with Dr Here Shite, whose neat bob perfectly offsets her generous smile. You should have seen the look of terror on the rodents' faces as we shouted: \"Watch out for the pussy!\"</p> <p>Many decades of detailed exploration of the inner contours of the Goddess Array ensued, until I was finally able to conclude that a happy vagina is one that is equally respected by men and women. And as I pondered this brilliant conclusion, I lay back in the Greek countryside where I was on holiday, and realised that the Earth was a Goddess, too. The hills enveloped me in their bosomly embrace and the trees bowed down to my vagina and cried: \"Come, Yoni.\" For three hours, 57 minutes and 28 seconds, I did as they commanded.</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> The Holy of&#xa0;Holies</p>",
  "<p>Private health firms can expect to win business worth around \u00a320bn from the NHS in the next few years by taking over GP surgeries and setting up new community health clinics, according to a report written for profit-making companies keen to expand their role in the health service.</p> <p>The \"\u00a320bn opportunity ahead for the private sector\" in the NHS as a result of coalition policies and pressure on public finances is set out in a briefing on the private sector's potential future role by <a href=\"http://www.catalystcf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Catalyst</a>, corporate finance advisers who specialise in healthcare.</p> <p>There is a \"significant opportunity for the private sector in primary and secondary care,\" says the Catalyst report. \"The introduction of GP commissioning and interest in healthcare models offering alternatives to hospital care will require a higher proportion of services to be delivered by the private sector. The markets for these services are estimated to be worth around \u00a320bn.\"</p> <p>Recent contracts worth as much as \u00a3500m which private firms have won to provide NHS services show the NHS is becoming more open to such providers, it says. \"Landmark contracts awarded to Circle, Virgin Care and Serco demonstrate increasing recognition from the public sector that leveraging the private sector's ability to invest capital and use more efficient delivery models is necessary for the government to reduce costs while improving the quality of healthcare.\"</p> <p>Virgin Care, part of Richard Branson's business empire, signed a \u00a3500m contract with a primary care trust in Surrey to provide community health services over the next five years and is the preferred bidder to land a \u00a3130m contract for children's health and social care services in Devon.</p> <p>Justin Crowther, director at Catalyst and coauthor of the report, said: \"Despite many challenges, the private sector is increasingly providing healthcare services, whether paid for by the taxpayer or directly by consumers at the point of use. Whether this is to turn around underperforming hospitals, operate GP surgeries, deliver community services or create centres of excellence in areas such as pathology, [NHS] commissioners are increasingly using the skills and capital of the private sector.\"</p> <p>With pressure growing for more services to be provided outside of hospitals closer to people's homes, private firms can expect to make inroads into the \u00a38.3bn spent on GP services every year in England, the report states. <a href=\"http://www.virgincare.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Virgin Care</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thepracticeplc.com/index.jsp\" title=\"\">The Practice</a> currently earn about \u00a3185m a year from operating GPs surgeries, just 2.2% of the primary care budget.</p> <p>In addition, of the \u00a38.5bn community health services budget, \"we believe the private sector could deliver up to 20%, or around \u00a32bn, by 2020,\"&#xa0;it&#xa0;says.</p> <p>Private firms could afford to build new premises which the NHS's budget squeeze means it cannot, it adds. The restructuring of pathology services is another opening, with the NHS Midlands and East of England's strategic health authority's decision to let private firms tender for a \u00a3500m pathology contract an example of a potentially profitable emerging trend.</p> <p>The creation next April of local clinical commissioning groups by the coalition's controversial NHS shakeup, groups of GPs who will buy healthcare for patients and control \u00a360bn of NHS budgets, will see them buying back-up known as commissioning support services \u2013 a market worth an estimated \u00a31.3bn a year \u2013 the report adds.</p> <p>While the impact of the Health and Social Care Act on the NHS's procurement policies remains unclear \"the role of the private sector is increasing. If this is combined with the removal of barriers to higher participation, such as in primary care removing practice boundaries and goodwill on GP practices, investment would be boosted and the opportunity for the private sector to build business with scale will be considerable,\" it predicts.</p> <p>Labour said the report was \"concrete proof that the great NHS carve-up is well under way. The government opened the floodgates with a Health Act that places a market free-for-all at the heart of the health.</p> <p>\"Since then, they have ordered the open tendering of community services, creating the conditions for private firms to pick off lucrative services,\" said Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary.</p> <p>\"Worse still, in Jeremy Hunt we now have a health secretary who bent over backwards in his last job to promote powerful private interests and, in his own back yard, encouraged the handing over of NHS community services to Virgin. The NHS is not at all safe in Mr Hunt's hands.\"</p> <p>Dr Clive Peedell, cochair of the NHS Consultants Association and member of the British Medical Association's ruling council, said ministers had misled the public with \"their repeated denials of NHS privatisation when this is clearly part of their supply side economic policy to replace large swaths of public sector provision of services with private provision/supply \u2026 The \u00a320bn QIPP efficiency drive agenda introduced by New Labour started this process and the Health and Social Care Act is the legislative catalyst, which will drive the privatisation process much faster,\" he said.</p> <p>As NHS services fail they will be offered to the private sector, added Peedell. Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire is already being run by private healthcare firm Circle, while private companies are being allowed to bid to take over the similarly debt-laden South London Healthcare trust, which is in administration.</p> <p>But Vernon Baxter, editor of specialist business magazine HealthInvestor, which monitors private healthcare, said opposition to private providers from NHS organisations could mean their acquisition of new business proves \"patchy\". \"The size of the opportunity for the private sector is likely to run in to the billions, but making it a reality is going to be a real challenge, and there will be significant resistance from within the ranks of the health service.\" While some CCGs would welcome private providers, others will not use them, he predicted.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-not-guilty-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">police officer cleared of killing Ian Tomlinson</a> on the fringes of the G20 protests in London will this week face further scrutiny into his conduct through an internal Metropolitan police disciplinary hearing which, unusually, will be held in public. It will be only the second time such an internal police hearing will take place in the open since a <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/2864/regulation/30/made\" title=\"\">2008 law</a> gave the Independent Police Complaints Commission powers to compel this in instances with particular public interest.</p> <p>A three-strong panel, comprising two police officers and a member of the public, will decide whether PC Simon Harwood's baton strike and push on Tomlinson as the 47-year-old bystander walked away from police lines on the evening of 1 April 2009 amounted to misconduct, and if so whether he should be sacked from the force or face another sanction. In July a jury acquitted Harwood, a member of the Met's elite the Territorial Support Group public order unit, of manslaughter following one of the most high-profile cases of alleged police misconduct in recent years. Harwood conceded his actions were excessive in retrospect but insisted he was reacting to a perceived threat following a day of wide disorder.</p> <p>The verdict left Tomlinson's family in something of a legal limbo: just over a year before another jury, at the inquest into Tomlinson's death, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/03/ian-tomlinson-unlawfully-killed-inquest\" title=\"\">ruled he was unlawfully killed by Harwood</a>. The disciplinary panel will know details of Harwood's past record which were not disclosed to the jury for legal reasons, notably that he quit the Met on health grounds in 2001 shortly before an earlier planned disciplinary hearing into claims he illegally tried to arrest a driver after a road rage incident while off duty, altering his notes to retrospectively justify the actions. Harwood was nonetheless able to join another force, Surrey, before returning to serve with the Met in 2005. The 45-year-old also allegedly punched, throttled, kneed or threatened other suspects while in uniform in other incidents.</p> <p>The hearing has no legal force, meaning that Harwood is not obliged to attend. The only other public hearing concerning officers accused of failing in their duty when they did not respond to repeated calls from Colette Lynch, a young woman in Rugby, Warwickshire, about threats from her ex-partner. He stabbed her to death days later.</p> <p>Deborah Glass, the IPCC's deputy head, announced in March last year that Harwood's hearing should also be public. Glass first consulted with Tomlinson's family, police and other potential witnesses on the idea of a public hearing. While Tomlinson's relatives supported this, 11 of the 13 individual police officers she contacted were opposed.</p> <p>The Met's official position was that a public hearing was necessary to \"maintain and if necessary restore public faith\" in the police force. However, speaking about the case, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley of the Met police said there was no plan to extend public disciplinary hearings to other cases.<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>This was a 3-1 rout for Tottenham, even if Reading did limit the damage until a second goal was supplied by Gareth Bale in the 71st minute. Jermain Defoe, who had opened the scoring, soon added the third. It would be far fetched to make a fuss about the fact that this was Tottenham's first Premier League victory under Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas in four attempts but it will help to establish him in the eyes of the club's supporters.</p> <p>It would be over doing it to pretend that the manager's tactics here were an act of genius but he did run risks by employing Defoe as a lone striker. They paid off. The one dissident could be Emmanuel Adebayor, a striker who spent his afternoon on the bench, but there could be no cause for rebellion when Villas-Boas's approach worked so well.</p> <p>There was a fluidity to Tottenham's play but it would be unfair to present Reading as mere stooges. Brian McDermott's side were not without merit and there has to be acknowledgement that the ascent into the Premier League, given the calibre of Reading's new rivals, will be something of an ordeal. Even so, no one at the Madejski Stadium looked as if they were overwhelmed by foreboding.</p> <p>It took time for them to appreciate that notice would have to be taken of a Tottenham under interesting redevelopment. The campaign has barely drawn breath but that need not check the excitement of onlookers. Signs of promise can be misleading but Spurs fans will find their hopes climbing when signings such as Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, bought from Fulham for \u00a315m in the summer, can already look entirely at ease in the team.</p> <p>Reading will carry grievances about decisions that went against them but the outcome was entirely appropriate. Villa-Boas does not become a towering leader with one win but it is a step in the right direction after his unhappy departure from Chelsea.</p> <p>The outcome might have been worse for Reading had Tottenham not been denied a goal with the score at 1-0. It looked as if the ball might have crossed the line before the centre-half Alex Pearce blocked it and it is a measure of Tottenham's performance that such an episode was only a minor detail in a game where they were mainly in the ascendant.</p> <p>Reading scored through the substitute Hal Robson-Kanu in added time but solace must have been limited. This fixture was hard on Reading. They had gone 25 days without a Premier League match following the downpour that washed away their game at Sunderland. The team could have been deemed rested or, if all went badly, stale but they were so ineffective for so long that they forfeited any right to an excuse.</p> <p>Brian McDermott's side were in trouble even though the clinching goals were delayed. A better co-ordinated Tottenham led from the 18th minute when Defoe applied a strong finish to a cutback from Aaron Lennon in a move initiated by the outstanding Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Reading goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, deputising because of Adam Federici's knee injury, had already been fully occupied.</p> <p>The lead at half-time was one goal yet there could just as easily have been a rout by then. The failure to exploit Reading's vulnerability at an earlier stage was the one criticism that could be levelled at Tottenham \u2013 a flaw that must have been particularly irksome to the visitors' Villas-Boas as he searched of his first league win with Spurs. It was particularly ridiculous, for instance, that Defoe should send Lennon clear in the 35th minute, only for the winger to run the ball behind for a goal&#xa0;kick.</p> <p>The main asset enjoyed by Reading then was the leniency of Tottenham and for a while the score gave the misleading impression of a contest. Defoe put Tottenham ahead but there would have been recriminations if they had not increased their lead because he had also been wasteful. As it was, Villas-Boas and his men surely left the ground in a state of contentment.</p> <p>Reading might feel unhappy with particular events but the truth is that the task before them will be daunting week by week. There is no shame in that but the sort of means that can make a difference tend to lie with expensive footballers. All the same, the perseverance of the club has been put beyond question by their climb to this level of the game.</p> <p>McDermott conceded his side had been second-best throughout. \"The second goal killed us. We came up against a top-class side and they played well. They deserved to win We have to move on very quickly \u2013 you have to do that in this league.</p> <p>\"It's a learning curve for all of us. We knew we were playing against a team of world-class individuals. They played well and we didn't cause them enough problems.\"</p> <p>The outcome was disappointing for his club's fans but it was not the type of encounter that will plunge them into despair. This was a memorable day even if it did not come to the conclusion yearned for by the Madejski faithful.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Gylfi Sigurdsson (Tottenham)</p>",
  "<p>Officers from the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> are investigating an incident in which a 62-year-old man with a shotgun was seriously wounded in an exchange of fire with armed police.</p> <p>The man was said to be in a \"serious but stable condition\" in hospital in Brighton on Sunday after a six-hour standoff at a house in nearby Seaford over Saturday night ended in shooting. Two officers were slightly injured but not by gunshot wounds, according to <a href=\"http://www.sussex.police.uk/\" title=\"\">Sussex police</a>.</p> <p>The force said the incident was being treated as attempted murder of police officers before the investigation was handed over to the police watchdog.</p> <p>Sussex police said in a statement: \"Armed police officers were called to North Way, Seaford, at 7.10pm on Saturday following a report of a domestic incident involving firearms. A woman left the house safely a short time later. Police negotiators engaged with the man for several hours, but shortly before 1am on Sunday morning, he left the house and shots were exchanged with armed officers from Surrey and Sussex tactical firearms unit.\"</p> <p>The man appeared to be wounded, but went back into the house, the statement said. \"Officers then reacted as swiftly and as safely as possible to enter the house and administer first aid. He was taken to the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton with what are described as life-threatening injuries\". A shotgun was recovered.</p> <p>Nearby residents were advised to stay indoors during the confrontation.

  "<p>Germans are still shackled to their past and it greatly influences the way they deal with Europe and the wider world, according to one of the country's foremost writers and thinkers.</p> <p>Bernhard Schlink, author of The Reader and a series of other works that tackle the guilt of his and other generations about the past, says that German children today still have to deal with the difficult hand history has dealt them. In an interview with the Guardian to start a week-long series looking at Europe's pre-eminent power, the 68-year-old author says he sometimes experiences his own Germanness as a \"huge burden\" that he has come to accept.</p> <p>And he adds that the reason the European crisis is so agonising for Germany is that the country has been able to retreat from itself by hurling itself into the European project. An unravelling of the European ideal would deprive the Germans of an \"escape from themselves\". \"I can't say I'm thankful about being German because I sometimes experience it as a huge burden,\" Schlink says. \"But it is an integral part of me and I wouldn't want to escape it. I have accepted it.\" The former judge, whose main home is in Berlin, cites examples of friends and colleagues who have done much to disguise their Germanness, to assume other identities in an effort to escape the sometimes overwhelming historical responsibility.</p> <p>\"I remember one of the nicest things a colleague of mine in the United States said when he introduced a lecture of mine: that he had never met a German in academia in the United States who so little tried to hide that he's German,\" he says \"I certainly know German colleagues in the US who try to be Americans, try to melt into Americanism, even before they get married and become American citizens. But I've never tried that.\"</p> <p>The burden of nationality has very much shaped the way in which Germans view themselves and their responsibilities within Europe, Schlink says. It is a subject he covers in depth in a volume of essays, Guilt About the Past, in which he argues: \"We Germans tend to prefer to see ourselves as world citizens of a world society, as free citizens of a free world, as Atlanticists or Europeans rather than as Germans.\" The wish, he says, is symptomatic of another desire, to escape what it means to be German, including the solidarity, responsibility and guilt attached to that.</p> <p>Europe, he agrees, as a wider community in which Germany is only one part, is a place in which Germans have tried to retreat from themselves. \"I think that turning to Europe is an attempt to escape a difficult identity in favour of a more simple one \u2026 This idea will always fail, because a German who goes to France, England, the United States and presents him or herself as simply a European, this is not what he is, he is not just a European, he's a German and those who travel learn that the world is not as cosmopolitan and international as we'd like it to be.\"</p> <p>An innate sense of German fatalism is also playing into the way Germans are reacting to the current crisis \u2013 which after all has yet to directly affect them \u2013 as well as a melancholic streak. \"I sense some sort of fear of revenge for the fact that historically speaking, and in comparison to many parts of the world, we have it good right now,\" Schlink says over the phone from his US home in the Berkshires, Massachusetts. \"It's interesting, my son is 40 years old, a dentist, with a good life, two lovely kids, a lovely wife and everything's going well for him, but even he said to me: 'Well, don't you think maybe we've had it too good for too long?' I said to him: 'It's up to us to use this crisis as a chance.'\"</p> <p>The writer sees the German sense of melancholy and pessimism for which its people are sometimes ridiculed as national traits that mean that even though most Germans are enjoying a comfortable standard of living, low unemployment, and a booming export economy, they are unable to view it without sensing the doom that might be about to come.</p> <p>\"Germans have a melancholic, a pessimistic streak, which cultural historians trace back to the thirty years' war [a series of wars between 1618 and 1648 that devastated much of Europe including large parts of Germany]. There are these beautiful comparisons of German, English and French soldiers' war songs, and the English and French ones, they're all about hope and victory, and the German soldiers' songs are all about losing comrades, or imminent death. This pessimism I think leads people to ask now: 'Have we had it too good?'\"</p> <p>Most of Schlink's literature is tangled up in the German past \u2013 from his 1997 bestseller The Reader, about the affair between a teenager and a woman who is later tried for war crimes (which was made into an award-winning film with Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes), to a trilogy of detective novels surrounding about a character called Selbs with a shadowy Nazi past, and the novel Homecoming, whose protagonist goes on the hunt for a father he never knew.</p> <p>Even his latest work, Summer Lies, while focusing on modern-day love stories that all have a sad twist to them \u2013 although nothing to do with the war \u2013 touches on the subject of hidden pasts and the convoluted stories people tell to keep up appearances.</p> <p>This summer, he postponed work on his latest novel (whose subject is top secret) to concentrate on a script for a film set at the start of the first world war. \"I don't know for how many years, but definitely for the foreseeable future Germans will be shackled to their past and that will influence the way they act in Europe,\" says Schlink. He believes all this makes Germans intensely keen to show solidarity with the rest of Europe.</p> <p>\"But I think what Germans rightly say again and again is that if we are to give up our sovereignty and our prosperity or share our prosperity with others, then [it will be] only in the context of more of a political union.\"</p> <p>Growing accusations that the current German government has faced from across Europe, of being a fourth reich or having imperialist tendencies, \"is the expression merely of a sentiment of mentality shaped by history \u2026 I think in substance Germany couldn't be further from wanting to dominate Europe,\" he says.</p> <p>The calls for Germany to offer more leadership are problematic, he says, not least because that is not the way Europe is constructed. \"The very constitutional structure of Europe is such that one country alone cannot lead. What I think this question is really about is the expectation that Germany shares what it has even more generously and in as undemanding a way, as it is right now. And I think it's right that Germany says: 'Yes, we're willing to share but only in a context of a political union where the responsibilities are shared too.'\"</p> <p>Schlink says he does not feel particular pressure to follow in the postwar tradition of German writers opining on issues of moral responsibility, but rather feels he has a duty as a citizen and a constitutional law professor. \"As a citizen and someone who was a judge on the constitutional law court for 18 years, I feel whenever I can raise my voice with the hope of being heard I need to do it, but I wouldn't assign a special wisdom and responsibility to writers.\"</p> <p>On that note, he is highly critical of the great doyen of modern German literature, G\u00fcnter Grass, who has lately drawn criticism for two poems he wrote, one warning against Israeli aggression towards Iran and criticising the fact Germany provides Israel with nuclear submarines, and another criticising Germany's austerity measures against Greece. \"I didn't like the poems and the sad thing for me with Grass was the way he made his SS affiliation public: not the affiliation itself, I wouldn't hold that against him \u2013 but that he demanded openness from others for such a long time while hiding this,\" says Schlink, referring to the revelations in 2006 that the Nobel laureate had been drafted into the Waffen SS at the age of 17. \"That, in a way, took away some of the moral authority he had and I was so sorry that he'd lost it. These two poems have a shrillness that maybe reflects this loss of moral authority. He senses that maybe he isn't heard the way he used to be, so he becomes louder and shriller in these poems. I just find it sad.\"</p> <p>Schlink, whose father was a Lutheran pastor, believes Germans will remain ensnared in their past for some time, though the burden will become weaker from generation to generation. \"Already, it makes a difference as to whether it was your father who was in the SS, or your grandfather. Was it a grandfather whom you actually met, maybe loved? Or is it a grandfather who's just a picture on the wall with other family photos? Already, I see that my son has a different relation to the German past than I did. But even my two granddaughters [aged four and eight] will still have to cope with it. When they go abroad and go to Britain and see all these movies that still deal with 'bad Germans' ... and they will have to find a way to cope with it, and to understand that at least what they owe others is a sense of tact.</p> <p>\"They will have to learn where this anger comes from, that it comes from real wounds that still torment people.\"</p> <p><em>Bernhard Schlink's latest collection of short stories, Summer Lies, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson</em></p>",
  "<p>Uwe Albrecht has what he calls a wonderful problem. In his office in Leipzig's fortress-like town hall, the deputy mayor says the city's population has grown so much in the past decade that he is having to build more kindergartens and schools.</p> <p>\"Ten years ago we were talking about closing schools,\" he said.</p> <p>Now Leipzig is one of the success stories of reunification. New roads, rail links and a redeveloped airport have sucked in investment and international companies. But none of it would have happened without a colossal 20-year bailout that has already cost the west \u20ac1.3tn. \"Without the transfers from the west, it would not have been possible.\"</p> <p>With Europe slumped in an existential crisis, looking both desperately and fearfully to Germany to supply the leadership and the money to match its clout as the EU's central power and biggest economy, it is often forgotten that Berlin is a past master at financial bailouts. Which is why it is also weary of them.</p> <p>The enormous costs the country has shouldered since 1989 have pushed many to the limits of their largesse, with people fed up with how much they have had to pay and for how long. \"People feel these transfers will never stop, that the money will just keep flowing,\" says Matthias Kullas of the Centre for European Policy.</p> <p>In a domestic debate that mirrors the rancour and resentments that have broken out across the EU as leaders bicker endlessly over who should pay to rescue the euro, richer German states now complain about constantly having to help out poorer states via the national federal subsidies system. Just as tens of thousands of Germans tried and failed last week to persuade the country's constitutional court to rule against the eurozone's bailout fund, the rich southern state of Bavaria is taking similar action to try to freeze payments to poorer areas. Some southerners are calling for Bavarian independence from Germany, arguing it would be better off. In addition to the subsidies, German taxpayers stump up a \"solidarity surcharge\" of 5.5% of income tax to fund the hefty costs of unification in an arrangement due to last until 2019. \"East Germany might well need another trillion,\" said Katinka Barysch, a German economist at the Centre for European Reform.</p> <p>Despite the unification fatigue, the project remains feasible for several reasons \u2013 patriotism, empathy with the less fortunate easterners, and because the process is subject to the same rules, laws, political system and culture and can be easily policed and monitored.</p> <p>None of this can be said about Europe. The German merger model is not a template that can be applied on a European scale. When the euro was being created 25 years ago, the then chancellor, Helmut Kohl, used to argue that German and European unification were two sides of the same coin. The euro crisis has punctured that notion.</p> <p>And in the debate now raging in Germany over Europe, it has become acceptable to assert that Kohl may have been a great chancellor, but he got one thing wrong \u2013 the euro.</p> <p>\"It's healthy,\" said Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot, of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. \"This is the first time that Germany is having a proper polarised discussion on Europe. Europe still resonates in Germany. But now the debate is different. Some say yes, some want it smaller, some say forget it and turn their backs on it.\"</p> <p>This polarisation is generating tremendous uncertainty and ambivalence as Berlin agonises over which way to turn, poised between giving Europe the cold shoulder or spearheading a big new integrationist push towards a much more centralised eurozone federation. For the moment it's a case of muddling through, but few believe that this can continue for long. Whatever the outcome, Europe's future \u2013 and that means Germany's future \u2013 will be decided not entirely but mostly in Berlin.</p> <p>Writing last week in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the historian Andreas Wirsching likened Berlin's current dilemmas over Europe to those of Otto von Bismarck in the 19th century, suggesting the tug of war over the euro reflected a similar political dynamic that in the past had resulted in real wars.</p> <p>Germany's position in Europe, he wrote, was \"semi-hegemonic. That means a problematic in-between position which is not dominant enough to impose its will on its European neighbours, but is strong enough to be seen as a threat, generating opposition, stirring alliances, and always running the risk of leading to isolation.\"</p> <p>That may sum up the position of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, after she was hijacked at an EU summit in June by the leaders of France, Italy and Spain over euro policy. Indeed, Merkel has acknowledged the \"semi-hegemon\" status, telling parliament in June that Germany may now be big and strong, but it is also overstretched and not big or strong enough to meet the expectations of rescuing the euro.</p> <p>Tensions, suspicions and misunderstandings between Germany and its eurozone partners abound. Germans feel aggrieved at being penalised for success, being asked to shell out for other people's failures. The beneficiaries of the bailouts feel bullied by Berlin dictating their budget and fiscal policies. They complain when Germany leads \u2013 and when it does not. \"It's always been viewed as common sense in Germany to be pro-European,\" said David McAllister, the prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony. \"But now for the first time there's a noticeable anti-European feeling.\"</p> <p>German competitiveness, for example, and the success of the \"made in Germany\" brand that has made the country a global exports champion, is frequently criticised by those on the other side of the euro debate, feeding German defensiveness and a sense of grievance.</p> <p>Hans Kundnani, editorial director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that Germans are blinded by an \"export nationalism\" or have become too dependent on their exports, which generate nearly half of all German GDP. \"Germany needs to become less competitive, and contract its export sector in relation to GDP.\"</p> <p>Such advice is met with gasps of incredulity. \"We export like madmen to China, Latin America, Asia, India. We're an export machine whose success has nothing to do with Europe. We also did that when we had the deutschmark,\" said Wolfgang Nowak, a former aide to Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.</p> <p>Gunnar Beck, an expert on European law and a sceptic on Germany's so-called European vocation, said: \"Germany has not benefited from the euro nearly as much as many say. Asking Germany to focus less on exports \u2013 the backbone of the economy \u2013 would be like asking the British economy to focus less on the financial sector. There would be an outcry.\"</p> <p>The euro crisis has put paid to the fiction that Germany and France are equals at the top of the EU. But the German establishment has not yet resolved the issue of direction of travel. Take two voices from Germany's political elite, both of them social democratic. The signals could not be more different.</p> <p>Nowak, the former Schr\u00f6der aide, now directs Deutsche Bank's Alfred Herrhausen Society. He told the Guardian: \"Germans have taken it on the chin for far too long, and spent far too much money on Europe. And why did we do it? Because we swooned over the idea of the United States of Europe, hoping that people would forget that we're Germans \u2026 We felt liberated at the idea of being able to be Europeans. And others let us dream the dream as long as we always paid the bill.\"</p> <p>In stark contrast, J\u00f6rg Asmussen is playing a key role in trying to save the euro as the German on the executive of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and a former deputy finance minister. For him the answer is the United States of Europe derided by Nowak. Asmussen said: \"Every generation has to define anew how it deals with Europe and the European question. I wouldn't take it for granted that we can keep what we have achieved. Completing monetary union means four things \u2013 a banking union, a fiscal union, an economic union, a democratically legitimised political union. They belong together and depend on one another. And this integration will mean more freedom, more security, more jobs, more prosperity for the European citizen.\"</p> <p>This is the agenda Merkel also says she is pursuing, one that will tax all her qualities of leadership if she is to perform the double trick of coaxing her own people into acceptance as well as cajoling at least 16 EU countries into buying the federal Europe blueprint.</p> <p>The road to that Europe will be long and pitted with holes. Perhaps the most fundamental problem with the vision espoused by Merkel or her veteran finance minister and European architect, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, is that it is based not on enthusiasm or optimism, but has been born of crisis and fear. There is no upbeat dynamic, rather a dread that Europe will unravel into a patchwork of rival, resentful fiefdoms if it is not centralised.</p> <p>Besides, the French and the British are comfortable with the mantle of leadership \u2013 the Germans less so.</p> <p>\"Germans are very, very reluctantly dealing with the idea that they are the default leaders of Europe, that we're the ones that everyone's looking to for salvation,\" said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.</p> <p>\"Leadership by Germany was for decades the last thing that the world wanted and the Germans certainly would not have dreamed of doing so,\" added Jan Ross, a commentator for weekly newspaper Die Zeit. \"The word was taboo. Whenever the words 'leader' [F\u00fchrer ] and 'leadership' needed to be translated, it caused the tongue to knot.\"</p> <p>Now that everyone is pressing Germany to show leadership, it does not know how to respond, he said.</p> <p>Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, famously highlighted the dilemma in a speech last year in Berlin when he declared that he feared Germany's power less than its inaction.</p> <p>The acquired habit of relative passivity is proving hard to break. \"I think it's very good that Germany is hesitant to have a leading role,\" said Margot K\u00e4ssmann, former head of a Protestant churches' federation. \"The history of the last century has proven that was usually the wrong path to go down.\"</p> <p>In an internal paper distributed to German embassies this year, the foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, dwelt on the damage being done to Germany's image abroad by its handling of the euro crisis, warning that old stereotypes about the \"ugly German\" were being revived among the country's neighbours.</p> <p>The Der Spiegel columnist Jakob Augstein, alarmed that Berlin had blundered into self-righteous isolation over the euro, argued that it was better for Germany to be wrong but together with its EU partners than to be right on its own.</p> <p>\"I always felt a bit ashamed to be German,\" admitted K\u00e4ssmann. \"When I went to Yad Vashem for the first time I didn't talk German. I think I was 40 when I sang the national anthem for the first time.\"</p> <p>When World Cup football came to Germany in 2006 it marked something of a turning point. \"It was such a good feeling,\" recalled K\u00e4ssmann. \"My daughters wanted to put up flags in my house. I refused, but it showed me how they have no problem any more with their national identity and I think that's a good thing. Of course, it helped that our team came third, rather than first. To have won would have been a bit embarrassing.\"</p> <p>If modern Germany is more at ease abjuring the power and responsibilities of leadership in favour of a quiet, comfortable life, the frictions and misunderstandings making the European crisis worse are rooted in other psychological and cultural factors. In the midst of Europe's woes, it is difficult in the towns and cities of Germany to sense any trouble. The crisis is just not happening in a country with the second lowest unemployment in Europe. This mismatch makes it difficult to mobilise public opinion behind expensive action to fix problems that people do not feel affected by.</p> <p>\"I get the feeling that Germans are lounging on an island and not taking on board what the rest of the world is thinking,\" Elmar Brok, an MEP for the Christian Democrats, said recently. \"I sometimes have the impression that we Germans alone think we know what is right and that everyone else is somehow wrong.\"</p> <p>And despite complaints in Germany that they are paying the most to bail out the Greeks, Irish and the rest, Brok points out that the country is paying the same as everyone else in per capita terms. There just happen to be more Germans.</p> <p>Then there's the culture that makes Germans the biggest savers and most reluctant spenders, encouraging national stereotypes about the thrifty and the spendthrift, the scroungers and the stingy. Comparatively few Germans own credit cards, for example, and most are reluctant to take out a mortgage and are obsessed with saving.</p> <p>It is customary to ascribe these habits to a history of several currency reforms over the past century as well as the wheelbarrow inflation of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s.</p> <p>\"Hyperinflation and currency reform are firmly anchored as major traumas in the collective German psyche,\" said McAllister.</p> <p>\"Inflation is something that frightens us, and is one of the reasons why Germany included a debt brake in its constitution.\" It has also insisted that others in the eurozone follow suit. Facing an election himself in January, McAllister has made the ambitious pledge to eliminate his state's debt \"for the first time in our history\" by 2017.</p> <p>\"Germans have piggy bank genes, they save like mad,\" said Nowak. \"It's why they see Merkel as the mother of all piggy banks, defending their interests, their savings. The fear of hyperinflation is what makes the idea of printing money horrific to Germans.\" It also reinforces the allergy to bailouts and the growing disenchantment with the euro. Almost uniquely in Europe, Germany has no anti-EU party. But there is a growing band of eurosceptics who would like to see the country leave the euro, while the mainstream appears determined to control it.</p> <p>\"What won't happen is large-scale fiscal transfers without very strong central control,\" said Barysch.</p> <p>Guerot in Berlin added: \"The German political elite is very pessimistic about what is doable and still acceptable to public opinion. The Germans are eager to find a way of controlling other people's spending. If they're going to cover the others' debt, they won't do it for free.\"</p> <p>McAllister points to the power of the press and some reports that Germans are ingesting about the rest of the eurozone. \"A German reads that the average Greek retires at 58, 59, the average French person at 62. He or she feels that we've gone through all these structural reforms in the last few years, we've had little or no wage rises, we can expect to retire at 67, we've really worked hard to make Germany more competitive, yet the one who makes the effort is punished and those who don't do anything get away with it.</p> <p>\"Germans are distancing themselves from Europe and that's something we've never seen before.\"</p>",
  "<p>Iran has confirmed for the first time that forces from its revolutionary guards corps (IRGC) are in Syria helping Bashar al-Assad's government crush rebels, and warned that it would get involved militarily if its Arab ally came under attack.</p> <p>In a clear public signal of Tehran's continuing support for Assad, the commander of the Islamic republic's elite military formation said that a number of members of the IRGC's Qods force were in Syria, though General Mohammad Ali Jafari gave no further details and claimed this did not constitute \"a military presence\".</p> <p>It was a surprisingly candid response to persistent claims by western countries, the Syrian opposition and Israel that Iran is actively helping the regime in the 18th month of a bloody war. Lakhdar Brahimi, the veteran Algerian diplomat who replaced Kofi Annan as UN envoy to Syria earlier this month, met Assad in Damascus on Saturday but warned afterwards that any progress would be slow and halting given the yawning gap between government and opposition. \"The crisis is dangerous and getting worse, and it is a threat to the Syrian people, the region and the world,\" said Brahimi.</p> <p>Reports from Syriaon Sunday described government forces fighting rebels amid shelling and sniper fire in Damascus and Aleppo, as well as in Homs and Deir ez-Zor. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist network, reported 103 dead. Opposition activists reported 115 people killed on Saturday. According to the UN around 20,000 people have been killed. Opposition sources say the figure is closer to 30,000.</p> <p>Jafari's admission underlines the way in which the Syrian uprising has become enmeshed in regional and international rivalries. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are arming Syrian rebel groups, while the US, Britain and France have called for Assad to go but are offering only limited and non-lethal backing to the armed opposition. Russia and China have repeatedly blocked action against Syria at the UN.</p> <p>The Qods force includes elements of special forces, intelligence gathering and aid, and answers to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It has been accused of planning attacks inside Iraq since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Jafari said that the IRGC was providing \"intellectual and advisory help\" to Syria.</p> <p>British officials say that the IRGC has provided riot control equipment and technical advice on how to crush dissent, for example on how to flood areas with security forces. Iran is also providing support to improve the Syrian regime's intelligence gathering capabilities and help to monitor protesters' use of the internet and mobile phone network, including text messaging.</p> <p>Iran is said to have been dismayed at the heavy-handed way its long-standing Arab ally responded when the unrest began in March 2011, contrasting it with the more sophisticated response to protests that followed its own disputed presidential election in 2009.</p> <p>\"If Syria came under military attack, Iran would also give military support but it \u2026 totally depends on the circumstances,\" AFP reported Jafari as saying at a rare press conference in Tehran.</p> <p>The general also said that the Strait of Hormuz, the channel at the mouth of the Gulf through which a third of the world's traded oil passes, would be a legitimate target for Iran should it be attacked. \"If war occurs in the region and the Islamic republic is involved, it is natural that the Strait of Hormuz as well as the energy [market] will face difficulties. The US has many vulnerabilities around Iran, and its bases are within the range of the guards' missiles. We have other capabilities as well, particularly when it comes to the support of Muslims for the Islamic republic,\" he said.</p> <p>In Damascus, Brahimi also met Syrian opposition figureswho are still tolerated by the regime. \"We told Mr Brahimi \u2026 of our support for his efforts to resolve the crisis by ending the violence and killings, providing medical care and releasing political prisoners,\" said Hassan Abdel Azim, spokesman for the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change. But the head of the Free Syrian Army's military council in Aleppo, Colonel Abdel Jabar al-Oqaidi, predicted that the envoy's mission would fail, like Annan's, because he had nothing to offer those fighting for their freedom, al-Arabiya TV reported.</p> <p>Syria's state news agency Sana quoted Assad as telling Brahimi that the success of his mission hinged on \"pressuring countries which finance and train the terrorists, and which traffic weapons to Syria, to stop these actions.\"</p> <p>In Istanbul, Tariq al-Hashimi, the fugitive Iraqi vice-president, said in interview that the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was failing to stop ammunitions and armaments reaching Syrian government forces. \"My country is unfortunately becoming an Iranian corridor to support the autocratic regime of Bashar al-Assad,\" he said. \"There is no doubt about that.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Good afternoon </strong>and profound thanks to the scamp who lit the fuse by writing \"relegation six-pointer\" in the intro before withdrawing to a discreet distance. Yes, I know those media people looking for a fresh angle after the weekend's PL results delivered few dramatic talking points are keeping a close eye on this one in case the AVB \"crisis\" talk makes a front-page splash should Tottenham lose today but I can't see Daniel Levy doing anything rash after the club changed tack in the summer. He seems far more the type to plan, mull and then strike rather than act in haste to me. He believes patience brings far more rewards than impetuosity. </p> <p>Looking back at the Premier League head-to-heads at the Madejski \u2013 a 1-0 Spurs victory in May 2008, a 3-1 win for the Royals in November 2006 \u2013 the thing that stands out most from the earlier game (apart from a Spurs midfield of Lennon, Jenas, Zokora and Ghaly [I'd forgotten entirely about Ghaly]) is just how many players Reading have sold for more than \u00a31m since their relegation. By my reckoning they've sold Dave Kitson, Nicky Shorey, Ibrahima Sonko, Emerse Fae, Andr\u00e9 Bikey, Stephen Hunt, Kevin Doyle, Marek Matejovsky, Shane Long, Matt Mills, and most pertinently today, Gylfi Sigurdsson. By the time they won promotion back to this league in the summer, that income plus parachute payments must have meant the club didn't need much in the way of subsidy from the owner, which is a round about way of saying Steve Coppell's legacy has sustained the club long after his departure.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Holiday and cricket duties means I've seen these two only once each for the full 90 minutes this season though I saw loads of Reading's promotion campaign. I though Spurs, in spells, and particularly the first half of the first half against Newcastle in their first match looked dangerous, with Sigurdsson and Bale, in particular, a threat. They simply ran out of breath after playing such a high tempo, fortune, to a certain extent, and striking options. Reading impressed me against Chelsea and if Alex Pearce had headed in Ian Harte's free kick to make it 3-1 before half time I think they would have held on to win \u2013 in the end it took an offside goal and a sucker-punch with their keeper up in the Chelsea box desperately looking for an equaliser to make it a 4-2 defeat.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong><br><strong>Reading:</strong> McCarthy; Gunter, Pearce, Gorkss, Harte; McCleary, Leigertwood, Karacan, Guthrie, McAnuff; Pogrebnyak. <br>Subs: Taylor, Shorey, Mariappa, Le Fondre, Hunt, Robson-Kanu, Cummings. <br><strong>Tottenham:</strong> Friedel; Walker, Vertonghen, Gallas, Naughton; <br>Sandro, Dembele; Lennon, Sigurdsson, Bale; Defoe. <br>Subs: Lloris, Dempsey, Huddlestone, Adebayor, Dawson, Townsend, Caulker. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Howard Webb (S Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Kyle Naughton at left back. BAE is injured but I can't remember seeing him play on that flank but Danny Rose is out on loan. Seems odd to me that he isn't going to start with Adebayor if he's looking for Sigurdsson and/or Dembele to make support runs into the box and Dempsey is also made to wait.</p> <p>Here's Rob Moline: \"Saw that 'relegation six-pointer' and arched an eyebrow, a la Roger Moore (in the crap Bond movies). Regarding your intro, I see Daniel Levy as an incurable negotiator. He's brilliant at getting top dollar for players he sells, but sometimes it seems the excitement of the deal overcomes common sense. Like when he sold Berbatov and Keane out from under Juande Ramos on the last day of the transfer window that time. Got 50 million quid right enough; but then a couple of weeks later Spurs were deep in the relegation battle and he was forced to sack a totally disillusioned and no-longer-trying manager. So for my money drives Levy; not patience as you suggest.\" </p> <p>I see your point, Rob, but I think it's the deal and winning the deal or being seen to have won the negotiations that drives him, screaming, as it were, \"no one makes a mug of Daniel Levy\" to the big boys in the playground.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Maybe Benoit Assou-Ekotto isn't injured:</strong> He posted one of his rare tweets four hours ago which didn't suggest knack of any kind: \"Today is the day...cant imagine as. We loose. COYSsssssssssssssssssss. LOL,\" he wrote. Why the LOL? And of COYS - well YNWA has just been played and met with a fine reception by both teams' fans. Simon McMahon writes: \"Afternoon Rob.

That player (was it Len Shackelton?) who left the famous blank page in his biography wasn't wrong was he?\" It was him, Gary, the Clown Prince. And he wasn't far wrong.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>Alex McCarthy's PL debut means Federici's been dropped after a couple of mistakes. We had him on loan at Leeds last year and he was very secure. Reminded me a bit of Tim Krul.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>What on earth are Spurs wearing, a black and silver Blackburn Rovers tribute? Any how, Naughton makes some progress up the left, linking with Bale, before centring to Walker who has Lennon outside him but shoots from 25 yards, the ball flying several yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> McCleary launches Reading's first attack up the right flank but can't find Pogrebnyak and Friedel snuffs out the cross.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Double save from McCarthy when Bale shoots from a free-kick 20-plus yards out, pushing it wide and then getting up quickly when Sigurdsson latches on to the rebound and battering it away. They look very loose at the back, Reading.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> \"As they said in the 60s, Clapton is God,\" writes Mike Wilner. \"I say Modric is Clapton. If Dembele is better than Modric, well, finish the equation...\" Lennon is Ringo? Tottenham look patient and very comfortable in possession, trying to establish a bridgehead up their right flank to get Lennon running at Harte with Walker ready to bomb on outside.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Short break while boots and the wrong colour shin pad support tape are changed ends with the re-start and within a few seconds Vertonghen gives away a free kick. When the ball is played into the box to the far post, up goes to challenge. Kyle Walker or his doppelganger<em> I didn't see who</em>'s swinging arm knocks it off the head of the Reading attacker but the ref says he was pushed and the evidence supports him.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Sorry - have just had a couple of technical stoppages, the TV feed freezing then having to reboot this programme. Naughton again does well up the left, going past Gunter and swinging in his cross that goes over the box and Lennon had not read it, letting it roll beyond him and out.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Reading 0-1 Spurs (Defoe)</strong> Excellent pass splits Ian Harte and Kaspers Gorkss and Lennon had made the run on the outside of Harte into space. He picks it up and taps it back on the run to Defoe who has run three yards or so into the box and he clips his firm finish under McCarthy's dive.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 min: </strong>Reading's defending and communication among the back four and Leigertwood and Karacan is making this easy for Tottenham who are exploiting the space down the inside forward channels and on the outside of the full-backs with some excellent passing and intelligent running from Defoe, Lennon and Bale.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>22 min: </strong>McCleary speeds past Bale but Naughton is not going to let him past and clips his heels. Free kick to the right of the box whipped in by Harte without the bend he intended to reach the far post run of Pearce who has to improvise and in doing so makes a defensive clearance away from goal. Spurs break quickly, Defoe running through the middle and chances his arm with a shot off the outside of his boot that flies wide.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Sam provides this thought for the MBM merchandise department: \"Thought for a T-shirt: 'Half 11 at night (in HK) and all I've got is this lousy minute by minute (debatable) match report'.\" That'll have Superdry quaking, Sam. It's that slow When the Spurs go Marching In drowning out the Reading fans who have been silenced by their side's tentative performance, sitting back and ceding ground. .</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Reading have had a better few minutes using the time they've won to play it across the back four then up to McAnuff who gets picked off after a surge forward, Walker and Sandro winning it off him.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> It's been a bit meh since Defoe spurned his second chance. \"Surely Parker is Ringo, unshowy but vital to maintain the tempo and noticeable when absent,\" writes David Wall. Who's George then?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> McCarthy was just about to get his first PL assist with some awful, leaden footed control, letting Defoe take the ball wide and he had to go after him leaving an empty goal. When Defoe, though, turned and pulled the ball back after getting to the touchline, Reading had got two men back and Sigurdsson's scuffed shot was blocked on the line.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> The final ball lets Tottenham down after Sandro and Walker combine up the right, Defoe switching with Lennon and drawing Gorkss out with him. It created some space between Harte and Pearce but the pass to free Walker was too firm.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Oh dear, Reading's bag of cement approach to trapping the ball is gifting Tottenham chances and momentum. Ian Harte, under little pressure, 35 yards from his own goal, fumbles his attempt to kill a pass and lets in Defoe for a a run on goal. He has only punished such lax basics once so far and wasted three more openings but he will score again if Reading don't get a grip.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>38 min: </strong> But you can't count Reading out and they almost strike back having made headway up the right through McAnuff. It's as if they need a half-time spot of counselling to address their nerves. It's only 1-0 and should be retrievable.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Jermain Defoe is not having the confidence problems seeming to affect Reading, shooting again when gifted a half-chance from 25 yards. Nothing wrong with his self-belief but there's a little bit wrong with his accuracy.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min: </strong> Here's a gallery of match pics for you to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2012/sep/16/premierleague-tottenham-hotspur\">peruse</a>. Gorkss is let down by his team-mates up front from Guthrie's corner. He stayed up when it broke down but when he won it and attempted to tee up one, any, of his team-mates by guiding the ball towards the penalty spot, no one anticipated it and made a run to meet him.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 min: </strong>This has been Tottenham's half by a country mile but Reading's hope must be that they're only 1-0 down and can't be as poor again.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong><strong>Half time: </strong> Reading 0-1 Tottenham </strong> \"Your scamp doesn't know what a six-pointer is,\" writes Paul Scott. \"The teams have to be exactly 3pts apart for it to apply.

Otherwise every game is a six pointer entirely devaluing it's true definition.\" Fair point Paul but they key word for the Arsenal fan behind it was \"relegation\". For those of you asking for goal descriptions, I'm afraid it's the same old story.

Guthrie drops back into the centre of midfield.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> And Reading begin with far more attacking intent, moving McAnuff wider and allowing Harte forward. The left-back takes the ball off the winger, checks inside and fires in a right-foot cross from the left that only just eludes ALF's head on the dive.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Vertonghen goes on a marauding run up the left on the diagonaland into the box past Sigurdsson. he lays the ball off to the Icelander and screams for it back but Sigurdsson switches to the other side and tries to find Lennon's run into the box from the right but overhits his pass.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> If Lennon could just assess the best option open to him when he has the ball and beats the full-back, he would be world class. Bale gives him grief for failing to find him having done 95% of his job right then wasting all his effort with a dreadful final ball.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> \"Surely AVB is George,\" writes Matt Dony. \"A little bit cryptic, a little bit in awe of the talent he works with (less applicable since Modric went), frustrated that he doesn't get the credit he feels he deserves, and he's capable of the odd piece of sublime genius. Here comes the son of Mourinho.\" Good interplay from Dembele and Sigurdsson again using one of the inside forward channels, this one the left, to trouble Reading. Dembele takes the ball 20 yards with his left, dinks it to Sigurdsson then gets it back when the shot is blocked but can't get enough power on the angle to drive his shot underneath McCarthy's dive.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Free kick to Reading on the left taken by Harte who booms it way beyond the back post and on to Gorkss's head but Spurs have enough players back to squeeze the danger away.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Defoe and Lennon pinball the ball in from the right touchline between them with the centre-forward pinging it past Harte for Lennon's run into the box. He crosses but Gorkss reads it and slides in to clear behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> \"It's early season yet,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"But we'll be lucky to see anything as magnificently conceived and executed as Peter Odemwingie's tribute yesterday to Father Ted's kicking of Bishop Brennan up the arse.

Perhaps Riether will remember when he is about to meet the pope.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> One would suspect that AVB is getting a wee bit twitchy now because Reading have been seizing some of the initiative and look to have found, in Le Fondre, the type of direct running that always causes problems. And he might get even more unsettled by Defoe just wasting another golden chance, leaning back and spooning his shot from the cut-back 15 yards out over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> \"Hi Rob,\" writes Russell Child, extraordinarily. \"Been supporting Spurs for nearly 50 years. First time I've fancied the manager.\" \"Gorgeous\" George will be mortified but expect it. Reading are making some inroads but they can't find the killer ball.

Reading 0-3 Tottenham (Defoe)</strong> Now that was special, the ball played over the top. He took it on the run, drifted left past Gorkss and spanked an excellent shot back across the are and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> I don't really get why Reading were so anxious at the start which gave Tottenham the initiative. They established their superiority and cashed in and given the chances created this should be a more devastating defeat for the hosts.

Spurs are happy to back off but know the forward ball will be the key and mark tight so that when it is finally chipped up to Pogrebnyak, Vertonghen is live to it and steps up to nick it off the Russian and clear upfield.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Two Reading substitutions. Robson-Kanu for Guthrie. Noel Hunt for Pogrebnyak.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Huddlestone slips a quarter-back 40-yard zinger of a pass from left-half to outside right. Lennon feeds Defoe with a short, horizontal pass but Pearce smothers his turn towards the box and he has to retreat.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Reading eke out a pair of chances through Le Fondre on the right of the box, slipping his man and hitting Reading's first shot on target all game, the rebound blocked on the line by Vertonghen. Lennon goes off, Townsend on for Tottenham.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> The game is petering out.

From the re-start Reading score.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> Reading appeal for a penalty from a corner they shouldn't have been given when Gallas looks to have tripped Le Fondre but the referee doesn't give it and then calls time.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Full time: </strong> Deserved win by Tottenham but Reading didn't really challenge them from the kick-off and though they improved in the second-half it was like a cakewalk at times. \"Spurs have had an awful lot of joy down Ian Harte's side today and they'll doubtless not be the last,\" writes Patrick Wills. \"Surely McDermott must be wondering whether Harte's cultured set pieces and delivery from wide areas can justify his inclusion against the better teams?\" You'd think so, Patrick, but then again, where was his cover from McAnuff? Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, I thought, had a fine game, Defoe's positioning was excellent and his second goal was superbly finished. As I said last week, AVB's got the players he wants to make this system work and though they look a work in progress there was much promise evident to buoy him. As for Reading, a little more urgency was required. They were too passive for me and fell too easily into the trap of stereotyped 4-5-1 football but improved later on. Thanks for your emails.

  "<p>The man at the centre of Shell's controversial drilling programme in the Arctic has said he is aware of the responsibility on his head but is convinced the Anglo-Dutch oil group is acting in a fully responsible and accountable way.</p> <p>Speaking after a huge ice floe forced drilling 70 miles off the north-west coast of Alaska to be temporarily halted, Peter Slaiby, vice-president of Shell Alaska, insisted that the company had learned from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">Deepwater Horizon disaster</a>.</p> <p>\"We are raising the bar in the way we have been working with local communities,\" he said. \"We have made 450 different trips to consult and listen to any concerns. We believe the way we are doing this is important \u2013 not just for Alaska but for the wider Arctic region.\"</p> <p>Shell has spent more than $4.5bn (\u00a32.77bn) over four years preparing for work in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukchi_Sea\" title=\"\">Chukchi</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_Sea\" title=\"\">Beaufort </a>seas, off the state's west and north coasts, but has faced legal action, post-Deepwater Horizon drilling bans and a very short summer weather window.</p> <p>The Chukchi operation finally started eight days ago, on Sunday 10 September, only to be halted almost immediately by the threat of the ice floe, 30 miles long and 12 miles wide, heading towards the drill ship.</p> <p>The disruption triggered a call from Greenpeace for Shell to end its activities completely. It also precedes a report into what Britain should do to safeguard the Arctic, which is scheduled to be released on Thursday by a House of Commons select committee.</p> <p>Environmentalists say a spill similar to Deepwater Horizon would be catastrophic in a pristine environment badly affected by climate change and home to threatened mammals&#xa0;such&#xa0;as polar bears, bowhead whales and walrus.</p> <p>Asked if another major spill would destroy the company's reputation, Slaiby said: \"I feel there is a helluva responsibility on my head, but we have clear accountability models. I have the ability to do things in the right way and I have the backing of the most senior leaders in Shell to do things the right way.\"</p> <p>The company hopes to have Noble Discoverer, its drill ship, back on station any day now to continue its work, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/jul/16/greenpeace-activists-shell-petrol-station-video\" title=\"\">demands from Greenpeace and others to call off the operation</a>. Critics have many concerns, from wider fears about new oil production fuelling global warming, to more localised worries that Shell is not as prepared as it claims.</p> <p>Slaiby, said the company fully understands the impact of carbon on climate change but said oil and gas are still needed to meet growing global energy demand in the near term. \"The <a href=\"http://www.usgs.gov/\" title=\"\">US Geological Survey</a> says that about 25% of the world's remaining hydrocarbon reserves are here [the Arctic]. And 25% of those are here in Alaska. Oil and gas are part of the mix, a big part of the energy puzzle, and we have to ensure local communities benefit economically.\"</p> <p>As for safety, Slaiby insisted a \"very, very robust\" oil spill programme had been established to tackle any crisis. He rejected any idea that there could be a repeat of Deepwater, which damaged the beaches of the southern states of the US. \"These wells are very, very different from the Gulf of Mexico wells because they do not have the ability to flow at the rate you have in the Gulf: they are shallower. We are not dealing with deepwater wells. The geology is relatively simple and a third of the pressure [can be expected] in the Chukchi ... The sea conditions in terms of the wind, waves and currents are not even as extreme as the North Sea, although, clearly, there is no ice in the North Sea.\"</p> <p>The decision to move the drill ship once it had started drilling was a demonstration of how careful Shell will be in the event of ice in the region, Slaiby said. However, a freedom of information request by a federal employees group in Washington has shown that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/09/shell-criticised-limited-testing-alaska-drilling-containment?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">only two brief tests were undertaken on Shell's new containment dome</a> designed to prevent oil spewing into the ocean, and there appeared to be no independent verification.</p> <p>Slaiby, who has worked in the North Sea off Lowestoft in Suffolk, said these revelations gave a misleading picture because Shell had been in meetings over many months with regulators and others about a much wider safety plan. And it had been working for a long time with a third-party contractor and leading drilling safety experts, such as Wild Well Control of Houston.</p> <p>\"We even had the director of BSEE [<a href=\"http://bsee.gov/\" title=\"\">Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement</a>] out with me looking at the capping stack \u2026 I find these charges (of insufficient planning) groundless.\"</p> <p>The preparations made by Shell and others have been under review by the House of Commons environmental audit committee which will release its first report, Protecting the Arctic, on Thursday.</p> <p><strong>Leader comment, page 28 </strong></p>",
  "<p>My former teacher <a href=\"http://upload.sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1126817\" title=\"Interview with Andrew Morgan\">Andrew Morgan</a>, who has died aged 88, was ever ready to challenge the often complacent assumptions among his students with a combination of humour, gentleness and firmness.</p> <p>As the history teacher at Sedbergh school, in Cumbria, he encouraged us to read the New Statesman \u2013 unusual in a boys' public school at that time. An inspired teacher, he brought history alive through his erudition and commitment, showing himself to be a compassionate, rounded individual upon whom we could model ourselves. His pupils included Tom Bingham (later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/sep/11/lord-bingham-of-cornhill-obituary\" title=\"Lord Bingham of Cornhill obituary\">Lord Bingham of Cornhill</a>), Christopher Bland (who became a BBC chairman) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/22/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"Robert Rhodes James obituary\">Robert Rhodes James</a> (later a Conservative MP for Cambridge).</p> <p>Andrew was born in Aberystwyth, the son of a teacher. Educated at Tonbridge school, in Kent, where he was head boy, he went straight into the navy. He served with distinction in submarines and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After reading history at Queen's College, Oxford (1945-48), he was appointed at Sedbergh.</p> <p>Andrew said he finally felt suffocated by the attitudes of some of the staff there, and he left Sedbergh in 1964 to become head of a small boys' grammar, De Aston school in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, where he was reputedly a brilliant headteacher \u2013 colleagues and former pupils have written about Andrew's continued deep influence on their lives.</p> <p>The cornerstone of his career was undoubtedly to take the school co-educational, then comprehensive, as it expanded from 300 to more than 1,200 pupils. With a deft political touch, and a combination of warmth, relaxed manner and exacting standards, he succeeded in merging two schools that were more than the sum of their parts. Horrified by mediocrity, he ensured that pupils of all abilities received due attention, continuing to teach them himself.</p> <p>His social commitment over a lifetime was recognised with an MBE for \"services to agricultural wages\"; he had chaired a Lincolnshire committee which worked to ensure fair wages for agricultural workers in the days before the introduction of the minimum wage.</p> <p>After retiring in 1984, Andrew became an educational adviser in Lincolnshire for two years. He then set off with Jilyan, whom he had married in 1950, on a trip around England and Wales to explore the history of their families; this led to him producing a massive work, Swavis Mongrelian (the name combines different parts of their families). He never lost his interest in ideas and was reading and corresponding with his friends to the end.</p> <p>He is survived by Jilyan, their children, Lokadhi, Taradasa, Sarah and Rachel, and four grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>It is a disparate and often lonely brotherhood scattered across the US, fighting what it considers to be an existential threat: Islam. There are no headquarters, no organised structure, but members co-ordinate and communicate in pursuit of the common cause they call \"counter-jihad\". With different backgrounds and skills \u2013 religious and secular, tech and media-savvy \u2013 they wage personal campaigns through blogs, books and films to warn America of the grave peril it faces.</p> <p>Critics call them pedlars of anti-Muslim hate speech and try to ignore them but last week's mayhem in the Middle East thrust this fringe group into the spotlight. It says it is not chastened but vindicated by the assaults on US diplomatic missions \u2013 proof, they claim, of a war between America and a treacherous, expansionist religion founded centuries ago by a sexual deviant.</p> <p>\"In terms of high public profiles I'd say there is less than a dozen of us,\" said <a href=\"http://frontpagemag.com/2012/eric-allen-bell/the-high-price-of-telling-the-truth-about-islam-1/\" title=\"\">Eric Alan Bell, a California film-maker and activist</a>. \"We co-operate and communicate fairly regularly but there is no central control. Not everyone sings off the exact same sheet of music.\"</p> <p>Bell, 45, a one-time scourge of Islamophobia who changed sides after concluding Islam wished to subjugate the world, spoke to the Guardian from an undisclosed location after fleeing his home last Friday. He was mistakenly identified online as the maker of the trailer that inflamed violence across the Arab world.</p> <p>\"It's been crazy, completely insane, wave after wave of death threats. They're promising to torture me to death on video, to cut me into small pieces, sodomise me, a lot of screwed up sexual stuff.\"</p> <p>Bell had nothing to do with Innocence of Muslims, the 14-minute video posted on YouTube that depicted the prophet Muhammad as a murderous paedophile. But like other homegrown counter-jihadis he has been shrouded in its miasma. \"There is a mob mentality now. A lot of Muslims feel emboldened. Someone who has my address threatened to post it on Muslim sites so I had to move.\"</p> <p>Bell scorned the video's ramshackle production values but endorsed its depiction of Muhammad. Citing the first amendment's protection of speech, Bell has posted images of a burning Qur'an and a Qur'an with a pig. He compares Islam to the mentality of a rapist. \"It's all about submission.\"</p> <p>Innocence of Muslims was produced and directed by an Egyptian-American Coptic Christian, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55, who lives outside Los Angeles under the pseudonym Sam Bacile.</p> <p>Bishop Serapion, head of the Coptic diocese in southern California, disowned Nakoula as a rogue operator who did not represent the community's views, even though Copts complain of persecution by Egypt's Muslim majority. The bishop said two veteran anti-Islamic activists, Terry Jones and Steve Klein, had tried to fuel Coptic anger.</p> <p>Jones, a Qur'an-burning evangelical pastor from Florida, invited Copts to a protest he staged outside the Egyptian consulate in May 2011. Few attended. \"We don't believe in insulting other religions,\" said the bishop.</p> <p>Jones promoted the film's trailer but had no involvement in its making. Despite his visible media profile, Jones has no credibility among activists, said Bell. \"No one that I know in counter-jihad is in touch with him. He's a lunatic, an embarrassment to us all.\"</p> <p>Klein, a militant Christian activist and insurance salesman from Hemet, California, was a consultant on the film who reportedly advised on the script and logistics. He has more credibility than Jones within the movement but was a minor figure. He campaigned against mosque constructions and hosted a weekly programme berating Islam on an LA-based Arabic Christian outlet called The Way TV.</p> <p>Much of the anti-Islamic circuit comprises similar characters who write blogs, self-publish little-read books and rub shoulders at events organised by the likes of Act for America that claims to \"defend western civilisation\". Another rallying point are conventions held by the Centre for Security Policy, a Washington-based ultra-conservative thinktank founded by Frank Gaffney, and talks by Robert Spencer, who runs Jihad Watch, and the writer <a href=\"http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/index.xml http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Horowitz\" title=\"\">David Horowitz</a>.</p> <p>\"We meet at these things and get to compare notes,\" said Jim Horn, a retired diplomat who warns of sharia law atrocities in his self-published book Experiencing Islam. \"We know what Islam's intentions are \u2013 to colonise us, turn us into another Egypt. I've received death threats because of my book.\"</p> <p>The site <a href=\"http://loonwatch.com/\" title=\"\">loonwatch.com</a>, which tracks radical anti-Islamic activists, calls them deluded and often unbalanced hate-mongers. Such threats tend to be worn as a badge of honour and cited as proof of Islam's intolerance, emboldening fresh inflammatory rhetoric and fresh threats, a self-perpetuating cycle.</p> <p>What passes for intellectual debate within this largely self-contained milieu includes whether it is correct to distinguish between moderate and radical Islam, and whether to reach out to ordinary Muslims. Many self-styled counter-jihadis are secular, or wear their religion lightly, and frame their beliefs not in Christian but American terms, such as citing the first amendment in defence of their right to speak out.</p> <p>They say the US government has been at best hoodwinked, at worst hijacked, by Muslim interests. Purported evidence includes the FBI's consultations with the Council on Islamic-American Relations (Cair) \u2013 a front, in the eyes of counter-jihadis, for Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida. The attendance by the Los Angeles county sheriff, Lee Boca, at Cair fundraisers has made him deeply suspect in their eyes.</p> <p>With Barack Obama in the White House and a \"liberal bias\" in mainstream media, the movement relies on social media and low-budget films to spread its message. Bell, the film-maker in hiding, claims to have hundreds of thousands of readers of his <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/EricAllenBell\" title=\"\">Facebook</a> fan page.</p> <p>He did not consider violent assaults on US diplomatic missions across the Arab world as reason to tone down tirades against Islam. On the contrary. \"I've put out YouTube videos which I think are just as offensive as the one which started all this. I don't plan to stop,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The former cabinet minister David Blunkett will on Monday deliver a stinging attack on \"the dangerous overbearing imperialism of Germany\", as he makes a call to find new ways to end public disengagement with politics and strengthen the power of elected politicians to combat the power of unfettered markets.</p> <p>He accuses the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of trying to \"veto the voters\" in sovereign countries, and claims that without German-imposed austerity measures, the crises in Spain and Greece might not have happened.</p> <p>Warning about new levels of alienation from politics in the UK, Blunkett claims governments can only act as a counterweight to the debilitating global power of bond markets and technocrats if they have an engaged electorate behind them.</p> <p>He says in a pamphlet titled In Defence of Politics, with a foreword by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, that rebuilding interest in politics from the bottom up will need initiatives to help school governors, community health commissioning groups and even state funding of campaigns such as Make Poverty History. Recent constitutional reforms such as an elected House of Lords are irrelevant to re-engaging ordinary people with the potential power of democracy and collective action, he claims.</p> <p>\"The left has to put a shot of electricity back in the political system and find new ways of re-engaging people with government, or else it will be lost, and people will turn to the politics of grievance offered by extremists. A functioning, engaged political democracy has to be the countervailing force against the unfettered and unregulated market. You rebuild commitment to the political process from the bottom, and not from top-down reforms,\" he said.</p> <p>Blunkett, one of the older heads that advises Miliband, also addresses:</p> <p>\u2022 what he regards as the irrelevance of the Leveson inquiry. He believes it has failed to address the real risk that the entire traditional newspaper industry is on the brink of commercial collapse, leading to a decline in reliable journalism \u2013 a bulwark of democracy. He proposes a tax on search engines, such as Google, recycling journalism. \"If proper journalism goes down the pan, we are all doomed\", he said.</p> <p>\u2022 the likelihood that vast swaths of local government services will after 2015 be delivered by volunteers, or by fractured education and health services for which there is no true accountability.</p> <p>\u2022 the failure of Labour politicians to offer voters a coherent narrative for the causes of the banking crisis of 2008, so allowing the right and the bond markets to seize back control of the argument on the economy.</p> <p>In an accompanying interview, Blunkett says the bureaucracy and interference of the EU has been a force for alienation in the UK, saying we need to be crystal clear about what Europe does\". He singles out Germany for the way in which it has sought to impose its thinking across Europe on how to respond to the economic crisis.</p> <p>He said: \"Angela Merkel has behaved in a very dangerous, almost imperialist, manner. It is ironic that Europe was established to stop one individual government having overbearing power, and here we are.</p> <p>\"It could be described as nothing short of a coup in terms of what occurred in Greece, with the removal of the prime minister, and in Italy, with the removal of both the prime minister and the cabinet.</p> <p>Blunkett said: \"No sooner had the voters given their verdict than the chancellor of Germany was seeking to veto the voters with the argument that recently signed pacts cannot be easily unpicked by incoming governments. The tone and nature of the German response was, however, deeply unhelpful and the height of arrogance. Once again, the Germans were appearing to believe that they had the right (or their leadership had the right) to trump the decisions of voters in individual sovereign countries\".</p> <p>He claimed: \"If Germany had been willing to be flexible earlier, we probably would not had the last three years\".</p> <p>He also warns that greater transparency about the lives of elected politicians has increased rather than decreased voter scepticism. \"More is known about our professional politicians than in the whole of our history. Their lives, their income, their contacts are registered, surveyed and commented upon; a transformation from the much-revered and often grossly overblown view of the past. Taken together, the24-hour, seven-day-a-week news, instant communication through the internet and social media such as Twitter, has changed the terms on which we do our politics.\"</p>",
  "<p>Typical Wolves, as many of their drained supporters will no doubt have remarked as they left the ground. Two goals in the first half, created by the impressive French midfielder Bakary Sako and scored from close range by Sylvan Ebanks-Blake and Richard Stearman, appeared to have put them in complete control, only to be followed by a second-half performance in which the sense of panic under pressure was palpable.</p> <p>Even in only his fifth league game in charge, the Wolves manager Stale Solbakken must be feeling that the story is increasingly familiar. Having brought in seven new signings to make up for the summer departure of Steven Fletcher, Matt Jarvis and Michael Kightly, among others, the Norwegian is some way from finding a solution for the defensive frailties which characterised Wolves' last season in the Premier League. He acknowledged as much after Paul Konchesky's second-half screamer for Leicester prompted a spell during which David Nugent came within inches of equalising and Martyn Waghorn drove a shot against the post.</p> <p>\"You could very much see it was a team not used to winning \u2013 they got a little bit anxious, made some stupid mistakes, defended too deep and too narrow,\" Solbakken said. \"All the good organisation we had in the first half we lost in the second, but we fought well, we blocked shots in our penalty area and we have something to build on.\"</p> <p>It looked a certain three points for the home side after the 24-year-old Sako, bought from St Etienne towards the end of the transfer window, delivered a beautifully curling free-kick for Ebanks-Blake to head past City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from no more than five yards after 13 minutes. It was Sako's corner seven minutes later which resulted in Wolves going two up. Headed on by Kevin Doyle, the ball fell nicely for Stearman, coming in at the back post, to volley down and past the exposed Schmeichel.</p> <p>Leicester, among the bookmakers' favourites for promotion before the season started but now beaten in all three of their away games, looked totally out of sorts, but they were given a way back into the match by the veteran full-back Konchesky, whose sweetly struck shot from all of 30 yards beat Wolves' goalkeeper Carl Ikeme high to his left.</p> <p>Having admitted his annoyance at the manner in which his side conceded from two set-plays, the City manager Nigel Pearson said he was not displeased with many aspects of his side's performance. \"We have to start producing winning situations more often, and we will do because we have the nucleus of a very good side,\" insisted Pearson.</p> <p>\"I've not known a side create as many chances as we have, but the margins are very small. We don't have the points we hoped we'd have, but if we get the performances right often enough, everything else will fall into place.\"</p> <p>Solbakken said Bako's potential was clear: \"When he gets a little bit fitter he'll be a better two-ways player, he'll be able to defend better position-wise on the left, but with the ball and with his shots he'll cause teams problems.\"</p>",

The air base has long been considered virtually impregnable because of its isolated location in the middle of the desert and multiple defensive walls.</p> <p>The attackers blew a hole in the outer perimeter of the base just after 10pm, then a 15-strong suicide squad flooded inside where they targeted the fleet of military aircraft.</p> <p>They were dressed in US army uniforms and carried assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests, Nato said, describing the group as \"well-equipped, trained and rehearsed\". Although 14 were eventually killed and the injured survivor has been detained, they caused serious damage on the base.</p> <p>The attackers killed two US soldiers and injured nine other people, completely destroyed six Harrier jump jets and \"significantly damaged\" two others. They also hit six of the aircraft hangars that protect planes and helicopters from the desert dust.</p> <p>The sophisticated, destructive and high-profile assault served as a reminder of the resources and commitment of the Taliban at a time when Nato troops are streaming home for good, sometimes at a rate of hundreds a day.</p> <p>Prince Harry, whom the Taliban had said they would target, is based at Camp Bastion for his deployment as an Apache helicopter pilot, but he was not harmed in the attack and former prime minister Sir John Major said bringing him home now would hand the insurgents a \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/16/prince-harry-afghanistan-taliban-triumph\" title=\"\">propaganda triumph</a>\".</p> <p>Hours after the firefight ended, and just a few dozen kilometres away, a \"very reliable\" member of the Afghan local police turned his gun on two British soldiers. He was not known to have Taliban connections, but had confessed suicidal thoughts to a colleague.</p> <p>\"We understand that he had mental health problems,\" said Daoud Ahmadi, spokesman for the provincial governor. \"A day before the shooting this man was talking with another ALP guy and said 'I can't bear to continue with my life any more, I prefer death to life',\" Ahmadi added.</p> <p>Despite confusion about his motive, the killing appeared to be carefully planned. The man, Gul Agha, had bandaged his leg and pretended he needed medical help; he shot the two British soldiers with a pistol when they came to his aid, an Afghan security source told the Guardian.</p> <p>He was shot dead in the ensuring firefight and when the corpses were examined, his leg was uninjured under the bandage, added the source, who asked not to be named.</p> <p>Hours later, in the early hours of Sunday morning, four US soldiers were shot dead by an Afghan policeman at a checkpoint in the nearby province of Zabul, said Ghulam Jelani Farahi, the province's second most senior police officer.</p> <p>\"Last night about 2.30am, a man named Adel \u2026 opened fire on the American soldiers. He killed four, wounded three,\" Farahi said. \"The initial investigation shows this man called the Americans and said, 'We are surrounded by Taliban, please come and help'. When they came to save the police from the Taliban, Adel opened fire with an AK-47.\"</p> <p>Six other officers out of 15 on the checkpoint have also run away with their weapons, Farahi said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri</em></p>",

Here are just a few disturbing highlights from the recent anarchy:</p> <p>\u2022 There are at least 100,000 armed fighters roving Libya with heavy weapons (including rocket-propelled grenades like the one that killed Stevens); the government has been unable to disarm them or prevent them from using these weapons against one another and the government; last winter the New York Times ran a story headlined: \"Libya Struggles to Curb Militias as Chaos Grows\".</p> <p>\u2022 On 6 June a roadside bomb was detonated in front of the very same American consulate in Benghazi from which Stevens was fleeing, though there were no casualties; in a similar attack in the spring, the British ambassador was targeted, though not hit.</p> <p>\u2022 For several months, armed groups have been looting and burning Sufi mosques around Libya, while police forces stand passively by; Salafist extremists have been blamed, but there have been no arrests.</p> <p>\u2022 Last May, the interim prime minister's offices in Tripoli were attacked by militia forces; four people died</p> <p>\u2022 In April, rival armed militias from Zuwarah and Ragdalein clashed in the Tripoli region, with at least 22 deaths reported.</p> <p>\u2022 Saif Gaddafi remains imprisoned by the Zintan militia that captured him; it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18671454\" title=\"\">detained the lawyer sent by the international criminal court to represent him</a>, and no date for a transfer to the government \u2013 let alone a trial \u2013 has been set.</p> <p>\u2022 In January, protesters in Benghazi ransacked the offices of the National Transitional Council, fuelling suspicion that some insurgents aspire to a separatist Benghazi government.</p> <p>\u2022 Al-Qaida is a local player in Libya not an import: the militia that took Tripoli last summer was led by a former al-Qaida fighter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/10/libyan-dissident-compensation-uk-rendition\" title=\"\">Abdel Hakim Belhaj</a>, held by Gaddafi in a Libyan prison until Saif Gaddafi helped release him as \"rehabilitated\" before the insurgency.</p> <p>\u2022 Even before the revolution succeeded, the leader of the insurgency forces, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/29/abdul-fatah-younis-killed-libya\" title=\"\">General Abdel Younis, was murdered </a>in Benghazi in an assassination that has not even been investigated, yet alone solved.</p> <p>This then is a story not of a few aberrant events culminating in an isolated attack on the US ambassador, but of ongoing chaos for which the lame Libyan government has had no answer. Clinton certainly was on target in alluding to how \"complicated\" the world is. But such complications have historical antecedents that have been largely ignored.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important lesson to be drawn is from the history of revolutions: overthrowing tyranny does not in itself establish democracy, but more often yields anarchy. And from anarchy and disorder come renewed tyranny. The French revolution led to Napoleon and the restoration of the monarchy; the Russian revolution ended with elimination of their rivals by the Bolsheviks \u2014 call them the secular Salafists of their time. The Iranian overthrow of the shah resulted in the rule of the mullahs. Does anyone think, given the cast of characters fighting him, that if Bashar al-Assad falls in Syria, the result will be democracy?</p> <p>This is not to oppose revolutions, which are in any case products of historical forces that cannot be stopped. Nor is it to criticise the idealistic revolutionaries who overthrew the 42-year old Libyan dictatorship in Tripoli or the military regime in Cairo. It is, however, to ask whether we can expect from western governments in London or Paris or Rome or Washington a greater appreciation of the risks involved in supporting revolutions unconditionally, blind to the complicated and contradictory forces revolution always unleash. It is to ask them to stop pretending every act of tribal hubris or militia violence is aberrant, and that Libya and Egypt are otherwise populated exclusively by aspiring democrats and liberty-loving computer geeks.</p> <p>Washington and its allies tend to ride a see-saw, blindly supporting dictatorships whose depredations they underestimate and then blindly supporting revolutions whose consequences they misjudge. And now the US is planning to send drones, marines and naval vessels to try to redress a chaos it inadvertently helped precipitate and should at least have anticipated. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/31/gates-rules-out-american-troops-libya\" title=\"\">taboo against \"American boots on the ground\"</a> in Libya is broken.</p> <p>If then we fail to engage more deeply with democratic revolution's complications; if we do not look more honestly at the rough realities of the cultures in which the Arab spring is unfolding; and if we continue to think we can \"bring democracy and liberty\" to Tripoli and Cairo and Damascus overnight rather than allow them time to realise democracy and liberty on their own \u2013 a long, slow, painful process measured by decades rather than months \u2013 these boots and drones will undoubtedly have their own unforeseen consequences that in the months ahead will be confounding us all over again.</p>",
  "<p><em>[Updated below]</em></p> <p>Nothing tests one's intellectual honesty and ability to apply principles consistently more than free speech controversies. It is exceedingly easy to invoke free speech values in defense of political views you like. It is exceedingly difficult to invoke them in defense of views you loathe. But the true test for determining the <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-history-taking-stand-free-speech-skokie\">authenticity of one's belief in free speech</a> is whether <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/us/georgia-in-suing-state-aclu-defends-klan.html\">one does the latter</a>, not the former.</p> <p>The anti-US protests sweeping the Muslim world have presented a perfect challenge to test the free speech convictions of both the American right and the Democratic party version of the left. Neither is faring particularly well. </p> <p>Let's begin with the Democrats. On Thursday, the Obama White House <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/09/white-house-asked-youtube-to-review-antimuslim-film-135586.html\">called executives at Google</a>, the parent company of YouTube, and \"requested\" that the company review whether the disgusting anti-Muslim film that has sparked such unrest should be removed on the ground that it violates YouTube's terms of service. </p> <p>In response, free speech groups such as the ACLU and EFF <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/activists-troubled-by-white-house-call-to-youtube-135618.html\">expressed serious concerns</a> about the White House's actions. While acknowledging that there was nothing legally compulsory about the White House's request (indeed, Google <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/14/white-house-innocence-of-_n_1885684.html\">announced the next day</a> they would leave the video up), the civil liberties groups nonetheless noted \u2013 correctly \u2013 that \"it does make us nervous when the government throws its weight behind any requests for censorship\", and that \"by calling YouTube from the White House, they were sending a message no matter how much they say we don't want them to take it down; when the White House calls and asks you to review it, it sends a message and has a certain chilling effect\".</p> <p>Right-wing commenters loudly decried the White House's actions on free speech grounds. Some of their rhetoric was overblown (the sentiment behind the request was understandable, and they did nothing to compel its removal). But, for reasons made clear by the ACLU and EFF, these conservative objections were largely correct. </p> <p>In sum, the White House has no business sticking its nose into which videos YouTube decides to publish or suppress. <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2010/12/big_web.php?ref=fpblg\">Corporations that depend on the US government</a> for all sorts of vital benefits and contracts, and which are subject to its regulations and punishments, will always perceive White House \"requests\" as being far less optional than similar requests from random users. Nobody should want the US government insinuating itself into the determination by private internet companies about which political speech they will allow.</p> <p>The White House's request to YouTube provoked almost no objections from Democrats, who \u2013 when there is a Republican president \u2013 tightly bind themselves to the ACLU and parade around as free speech crusaders. To the extent they acknowledged any of this at all, their responses ranged from indulging patently absurd pretenses (this was just a polite request from the White House: what's wrong with that?) to affirmative justification (the film is intended to cause violence and thus should be removed).</p> <p>Just imagine if the Bush White House had called YouTube and \"requested\" that it remove anti-war videos on the ground that such videos were endangering US troops. That is hardly some fantastical hypothetical. The claim that administration critics were \"emboldening the enemy\" was a <a href=\"http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/gop-dissent-attacks.html\">very common trope</a> during the Bush era (an ugly trope that some progressives <a href=\"http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/attacks-on-dissent-against-president-obama.html\">now repeat</a> toward conservative critics of Obama). John Ashcroft <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2001-12-06/us/inv.ashcroft.hearing_1_military-tribunals-terrorism-probe-attorney-general-john-ashcroft?_s=PM:US\">infamously announced</a> when testifying before the Senate in December 2001 that civil libertarian objections to administration policies \"only aid terrorists\" and \"give ammunition to America's enemies\". </p> <p>Does anyone doubt that if the Bush White House had \"requested\" in the wake of 9/11 that all anti-war or anti-administration videos be \"reviewed\" to see if they should remain on the internet \u2013 on the not-implausible ground that they might encourage attacks on American troops or personnel \u2013 that Democrats would have little trouble seeing why it is dangerous to have the executive branch taking action to influence private internet companies to suppress political speech? The actions of the Obama White House are no less inappropriate. </p> <p>Recall the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/02/lieberman_55/\">so-called \"request\" in December 2010 from Joe Lieberman</a>, made in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, that private corporations such as Amazon, Visa, MasterCard and others cut off all services to WikiLeaks, including hosting its website and allowing payments to the group. Those corporations instantly complied \u2013 how many American companies will continue with behavior which a leading senator announces is harming US national security? \u2013 and <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/12/how_lieberman_got_amazon_to_drop_wikileaks.php\">few Democrats had trouble understanding</a> why such a \"request\" was so odious. It should be equally easy to see why this is the case with the Obama White House's request to Google.</p> <p>Then there's the merits of the censorship case regarding this video. The claim that political speech should be suppressed because it is intended to \"inspire\" or \"provoke\" others to commit violence has been the favorite tactic of censors and free speech enemies for decades. Indeed, every single tyrant who wants to suppress political speech does so by claiming that the ideas being expressed are more than mere \"political opinion\": it is \"incitement\" to violence, they invariably claim.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, southern states repeatedly attempted to impose criminal and civil liability on the NAACP by claiming, not inaccurately, that the fiery speeches of the group's leaders in defense of boycotts and protests were inspiring some of the group's members to break the law and engage in violence. But the US supreme court, <a href=\"http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/886/\">in the 1972 case NAACP v Claiborne</a>, <em>unanimously</em> rejected that pernicious theory, holding that there would be no meaningful free speech if speech could be proscribed on the ground that it \"inspires\" others to commit violence: \"While the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, <em>it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity</em>\" [my emphasis].</p> <p>The court in Claiborne also noted that even \"advocacy of the use of force or violence does not remove speech from the protection of the first amendment.\" The court there was citing its <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0395_0444_ZO.html\">earlier decision in Brandenberg v Ohio</a>, which had overturned the criminal conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader who had threatened violence against political officials in a speech. The Brandenberg court explained that \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force.\" Obviously, if the state cannot suppress speech even where it <em>explicitly</em> advocates violence, then it cannot suppress a video on the ground that it <em>implicitly</em> incites violence.</p> <p>In sum, free speech is not intended to protect benign, uncontroversial, or inoffensive ideas. Those ideas do not need protection. It is intended to protect \u2013 to foster \u2013 exactly those political ideas that are most offensive, most provocative, most designed to inspire others to act in the name of its viewpoints. One could say that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/family-research-council-guard-shot-by-gunman-in-dc/2012/08/15/e420527e-e719-11e1-a3d2-2a05679928ef_story.html\">every significant political idea</a>, on the right and the left, has that provocative potential. If speech can be constrained on the ground that it can inspire or provoke violence by others, then a wide range of political ideas, arguably the only ones that really matter, are easily subject to state suppression. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396228297\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347530522778/a462deb1-9f4d-4a23-a78d-1d0107dac982-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A Yemeni protester burns a US flag as others storm the US embassy in Sana'a during a protest against a film deemed insulting to the Prophet Mohammed.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Yemeni protester burns a US flag as others storm the US embassy in Sana'a during a protest.

Nobody should want the state to make and enforce lists of prohibited ideas. Even if such state action does not offend you in principle, there's a very pragmatic reason to oppose it: those who cheer when ideas they dislike are suppressed will very likely find, at some point in the future, that their ideas end up on the prohibited list, and will have little ground for objecting when it happens.</p> <p>Then we come to the newfound champions of free speech on the American right. Conservatives do so love to depict themselves as victims: both in general and specifically as free speech martyrs. They particularly love to declare their rights assaulted at the hands of Muslims.</p> <p>Sometimes their complaints are valid. That was true when <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/01/13/hate_speech_laws/\">Canada formally investigated a hateful right-wing journalist</a> for his vile speech on the ground that it was \"defamatory\" of Islam, and when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/18/french-journalist-racism-drug-dealer\">France did the same</a>. It was true when Democratic city officials <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/26/rahm_emanuels_free_speech_attack/\">threatened or even acted to block</a> zoning permits for a fast food chain on the ground that its owner expresses anti-gay views. It was true when violent protesters tried to suppress Danish cartoons about Muhammad, and it is true now with the violence (that is partially) in response to this video.</p> <p>But the US and its western allies have, in the name of combating terrorism, engaged in free speech assaults aimed primarily at Muslims far more dangerous than any of those examples. And with very few exceptions, these same right-wing free speech champions have remained utterly silent, except when cheering it all on.</p> <p>Last September, the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/09/04/speech_23//\">justice department arrested and indicted</a> Jubair Ahmad, a 24-year-old Pakistani legal resident living in Virginia and charged with \"providing material support\" to a designated terrorist organization (Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT)). His alleged crime? As <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/09/04/speech_23//\">I wrote</a> when the indictment was announced:</p> <blockquote> <p>He produced and uploaded a 5-minute video to YouTube featuring photographs of U.S. abuses in Abu Ghraib, video of armored trucks exploding after being hit by IEDs, prayer messages about 'jihad' from LeT's leader, and \u2013 according to the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/63816237/Jubair-Ahmad-Affidavit\">FBI's Affidavit</a> \u2013 'a number of terrorist logos.' That, in turn, led the FBI agent who signed the affidavit to assert that 'based on [his] training and experience, it is evident that the video \u2026 is designed as propaganda to develop support for LeT and to recruit jihadists to LeT.' The FBI also claims Ahmad spoke with the son of an LeT leader about the contents of the video and had attended an LeT camp when he was a teenager in Pakistan. For the act of uploading that single YouTube video (and for denying that he did so when asked by the FBI agents who came to his home to interrogate him), he faces 23 years in prison.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last July, former Obama justice department official Marty Lederman <a href=\"http://balkin.blogspot.com.br/2011/07/begolly-indictment-and-first-amendment.html\">highlighted</a> the arrest of a 22-year-old former Penn State student for - in <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/July/11-nsd-919.html\">the FBI's words</a> - \"repeatedly using the Internet to promote violent jihad against Americans\" by posting comments on a \"jihadist\" Internet forum including \"a comment online that praised the [October, 2010] shootings\" at the Pentagon and Marine Corps Museum and \"a number of postings encouraging attacks within the United States\". He also posted links to a bomb-making manual. </p> <p>Regarding the part of the indictment based on \"encouraging violent attacks\", Lederman argued that it \"does not at first glance appear to be different from the sort of advocacy of unlawful conduct that is entitled to substantial first amendment protection under the Brandenburg line of cases.\" </p> <p>As for linking to bomb-making materials, Lederman wrote: \"the first amendment generally protects the publication of publicly available information, even where there is a chance or a likelihood that one or more readers may put such information to dangerous, unlawful use.\" As a result, Lederman concluded, the indictment \"would appear to be very vulnerable to a first amendment challenge\". </p> <p>Such blatant assaults on the free speech rights of Muslims in the US, and in the west generally, are common. In 2009, a Pakistani man in New York was <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2009/04/2009423233919457969.html\">sentenced to almost six years in federal prison</a> for the \"crime\" of including a Hezbollah news channel in the cable package he offered for sale to television viewers in Brooklyn. Just this month, a British Muslim teenager, Azhar Ahmed, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-19604735\">convicted of the \"crime\"</a> of posting a Facebook message which said: \"all soldiers should die and go to hell.\" There is even <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/06/01/free_speech_4/\">ample evidence</a> that the US government targeted its own citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, for assassination without due process <em>not</em> based on unproven claims that he was engaged in plotting terror attacks (a claim the government made only long after it was disclosed that they were trying to kill him), but rather due to its dislike of his political and religious sermons against the US which became quite popular among Muslim youth on YouTube.</p> <p>The rationale for all of this speech-based punishment aimed at Muslims is exactly the same as the one used to advocate the suppression of the anti-Islam video and other anti-Muslim speech: it goes beyond mere \"speech\" and is intended to incite or justify violence. Those who accept that precept to ignore or even cheer for the suppression or punishment of views they dislike, while loudly decrying it when it comes to the views they share, are not believers in free speech. </p> <p>They are just rank manipulators who exploit free speech values in an attempt to ensure that only their views can be heard while the views they despise are suppressed. This, unfortunately, is the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/06/free_speech_2/\">clear history of the American right</a>, now marching so flamboyantly behind the free speech banner in order to protect hateful anti-Islam speech.</p> <p>It would be genuinely nice to believe that these newfound conservative free speech champions would henceforth become consistent allies in the fight against state suppression of political opinions: not just when their own ideas are attacked, but also when those views they hate are, including those of Muslim critics of US foreign policy. Until that happens, the complete insincerity of their free speech cheerleading is manifest.</p> <h2>Other matters</h2> <p>It is just extraordinary, as I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/egypt-nbc\">noted on Friday</a>, that even after multiple wars and killings and invasions and occupations, the US, in the face of these anti-American protests in the Muslim world, is still stuck, oh-so-earnestly, on that eternal question: <em>why do they hate us?</em> That continues even as <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/16/afghanistan-nato-airstrike.html\">things like this</a> happen continuously.</p> <p>Along those lines, the New York Times yesterday <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/world/middleeast/anti-american-protests-over-film-enter-4th-day.html\">expressed bafflement</a> that Afghans would burn an effigy of President Obama given that he \"had made an outreach to Muslims a thematic pillar of his first year in office.\" As FAIR's Jim Naureckas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JNaureckas/status/247290827041292288\">responded</a>: \"Maybe WAR made a bigger impression?\"</p> <p>On a different note: over the next six weeks, I will be speaking in numerous American cities (and one event in Canada) on civil liberties, Islamophobia, the war on terror, the surveillance state, and related matters. Those events will be in California, Colorado, Missouri, Arizona, Michigan, Washington, Texas, and New Jersey, as well as in Ottawa, Canada. All events are open to the public, and <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/late-septemberoctober-speaking-events.html\">event information is here</a>.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>Numerous people have popped up in the comment section in order, quite unsurprisingly, to create all sorts of exceptions to \"free speech\" designed to protect their own views while allowing the criminalization of views they dislike. The hallmark of someone who does not really believe in free speech is when they claim they do, followed by a \"but\", followed by efforts to explain why the views they embrace should be permitted, while the views they despise should not be.</p> <p>The most common claim in this regard is that speech that advocates violence is not permissible. Leave aside the fact that most of the examples I cited above where the speech of Muslims was criminalized involved no such advocacy. Leave aside the fact that the US supreme court, more than 40 years ago and by a unanimous vote, ruled that \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force.\"</p> <p>Further leave aside that this free speech \"exception\" would render illegal all sorts of views which are plainly legitimate. Do people who believe this really think that it should be illegal for a Muslim to say: \"The west is continuously bringing violence to our societies by attacking us with bombs, invasions and occupations, and I believe the only way deter this is to take up arms and impose violence back on them\"? Should it be similarly illegal for someone to say, as the American founders did: \"I believe our government has become so tyrannical and unjust that it is now justified to take up arms against it in revolution\"? </p> <p>And finally leave aside the fact that all sorts of common political advocacy can be construed as \"advocating violence\". As noted, it is often claimed that those who denounce US wars as unjust aggression or imperialism are \"emboldening\" attacks on US troops and therefore inciting violence.</p> <p>My real question for those who insist that advocacy of violence should be suppressed is this: do you apply this view consistently? Do you want those who advocated the attack on Iraq - i.e., who advocated violence - to be arrested? How about those who cheer for the war in Afghanistan, or drone attacks on Pakistanis and Yemenis? The next time someone in the US or UK stands up and advocates a new war - say, attacking Iran - should they be arrested on the ground that they are advocating violence?</p> <p>Or is it the case, as it certainly appears, that when people say that \"advocating violence\" should be suppressed, what they really mean is: <em>it should be prohibited for those people over there to advocate violence against my society, but my society is of course free to advocate violence against them? </em> </p> <p>As I wrote above, those who apply free speech values inconsistently are not merely being hypocritical; worse, they are attempting to exploit free speech precepts to protect and legitimize the views of themselves and their own side while suppressing those views they dislike and which are advocated by the other side. Indeed, it's often the very people who insist that \"advocacy of violence\" should not be permitted who, in the next breath, justify the wars and bombings and drone-attacks of their government.</p>",

  "<p>Arc trials afternoon at Longchamp has been somewhat diminished by the withdrawal of all Aidan O'Brien's entries at the final declaration stage but the presence of the Japanese contender, Ofevre, in the Prix Foy brings a great deal of interest to a race that is usually well behind the Prix Niel in terms of its relevance to the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.</p> <h2>Sunday's best bets</h2> <p><strong>Orfevre (1.30)</strong> goes up against Andr\u00e9 Fabre's Meandre, last year's winner of the Grand Prix de Paris, in what will be his first European start. He has not been out since June and will surely be a little short of peak fitness, but it will still be disappointing if he cannot get home in front.</p> <p>Fabre's record in the Niel is exceptional, in particular when it comes to following up on the first Sunday in October, and while <strong>Last Train (2.40)</strong> has not won any of his three starts since a maiden win at Longchamp in April, he was just a nose behind Imperial Monarch in the Group One Grand Prix de Paris last time out. His light season thus far has \"Fabre's Arc three-year-old\" written all over it, and the 20-1 with Boylesports for the big one next month will not last long if, as seems likely, he is the winner today.</p> <p><strong>Shareta (3.10)</strong> is a fair price for a competitive Prix Vermeille, while Farhh, beaten behind Frankel on his last two starts, will have his hands full again as he attempts to beat <strong>Moonlight Cloud (3.45)</strong> in a four-runner renewal of the Prix du Moulin.</p> <p><strong>Lizzy's Dream (5.30)</strong> at Ffos Las is the best bet at the two meetings which comprise the domestic action on Sunday. The Robin Bastiman-trained sprinter is in just the right hands at a yard that has specialised in speedy types over the years and looks a good bet to complete a four-timer in the concluding heat at the Welsh venue.</p> <p>He got into trouble last time at Musselburgh before swooping late to complete a hat-trick, suggesting he would have been a more comfortable winner with a clear run. He had shown progressive form with two victories at Wolverhampton in the spring prior to a mid-season break and there seems every reason to believe that he can improve for experience. There looks to be plenty of pace on in this event and that should suit.</p> <p>The trainer Roger Charlton is travelling out this weekend to watch Cityscape run at Woodbine but he can enjoy a more modest success with <strong>Selfara (4.00)</strong> in the six-furlong handicap on the card. The selection has shown improved form of late and is on a hat-trick after successes at Nottingham and Folkestone. He had been second over this course and distance prior to those victories and this does not look the toughest of heats.</p> <p>At Bath, <strong>Jubilee Diamond (3.10)</strong> looks to have been found an ideal opportunity in the Bathwick Tyres Median Auction Fillies' Stakes to open her account. She has been highly tried, including at Royal Ascot when down the field in the Queen Mary Stakes, and should be too strong for her opponents given this drop in class. The all-weather heat she ran in last time at Kempton Park when she finished a good second should work out and this represents an easier task.</p> <p>Earlier on the card, <strong>Buzz Law (3.10)</strong> looks a tempting bet despite top weight. He has slipped back to a winning mark, having been successful off his current rating of 69 at Redcar last season, and ran with promise in a fair event of its kind at Newmarket last time out.</p>",
  "<p>This week we've been exploring how technology is being used to educate and engage in the classroom and our piece on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/2012/sep/10/mobile-phones-classroom-teaching\">using mobile phones in the classroom</a> caused quite the stir, attracting comments from enthusiasts, skeptics and those teachers in between. </p> <p>It's obvious that while many remain to be convinced of the potential, others are really excited about using one to one devices in their lessons. We brought together teachers and education experts on the topic, to share their thoughts, tips and advice in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/2012/sep/07/one-to-one-devices-schools-live-chat\">live discussion</a>. Here are some of the highlights.</p> <h2>Donna Comerford (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonnaComerford\">@DonnaComerford</a>) is deputy director of learning at Cavendish School in Eastbourne and on a mission to bring creativity, enthusiasm and fun back into ICT lessons.</h2> <p><strong>Don't be afraid if you don't know it all:</strong> I do not know everything there is to know about ICT, couldn't hope to and I'm happy to tell kids that. I think our job is now facilitating, allowing students and young people the space and time to experiment and try things out. My experience is that teachers feel that they need to be all knowing in all areas and that it might be viewed as a sign of weakness which they do not understand everything that is happening within their classroom.</p> <p>Think of how much you have just learnt sharing this social medium with other like-minded educators. A very powerful tool that, yes, we do not allow students to use within secondary schools.</p> <h2>Matt Britland (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattbritland\">@mattbritland</a>) is head of ICT at Kingston Grammar School. He has been teaching for six years and taught in both state and independent schools. Matt <a href=\"http://mattbritland.com/\">blogs here</a> and is also a teacher adviser to the Guardian Teacher Network.</h2> <p><strong>Choose the right tool for the job:</strong> The device in my opinion should very much depend on what you would like to achieve.</p> <p>The main pitfall is spending loads of money with no plan, no objectives and no idea what they are buying them or how they will use them. Before schools implement their 1:1 program it must be very well planned. There needs to be solid infrastructure, training needs to be addressed, consideration on how the classroom/teaching could change and it is so important to decide on a vision, aims and objectives. All this before the launch.</p> <p><strong>Get hands on with reluctant colleagues:</strong> One way to show members of staff the benefits of 1:1 devices is to show them examples of how they can benefit the learner as well as the teacher. Give them a demonstration and don't just tell them.</p> <h2>Steve Beswick is senior director of education at Microsoft. Within this role, Steve works to demonstrate the value of technology in transforming the education process.</h2> <p><strong>The impact of technology on education: </strong>Use of 1:1 devices require a wholesale change in school culture, teachers, students and parents. Changes to teaching methods and assessment. I agree that assessment needs to be potentially reviewed. In the context of gaming in education, gaming allows for failure. Within gaming, you initially fail often until you master the game. Academic assessment arguably needs to evolve in the same way. </p> <p><strong>It's horses for courses:</strong> I have a friend who says 'he snacks on his smartphone, he dines on his tablet but he cooks with his laptop'. I think this says it all. There is a place for all devices in a school.</p> <h2>David Rogers (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidErogers\">@daviderogers</a>) is a teacher at Priory School in Portsmouth. He is a geographer and leads the geography department (which is a Geographical Association Centre of Excellence). He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and <a href=\"http://daviderogers.blogspot.co.uk/\">blogs here</a>.</h2> <p><strong>Work with what you've got:</strong> At our school I don't see us ever buying shiny kit for students. Instead, we have researched what they already have and then ask how those devices can help learning. In our classes we have work handed in on everything from paper, slate (really), PPT, blogs, animations, videos, photographs, flip books, poems and paper mache models all for the same piece of work and learning objectives.</p> <p><strong>Accept you're a learner too:</strong> The key piece of advice I would give here is use your young people to help. Our digital leaders plan lessons with teachers who are not confident about using devices and then go along to the lessons to help out. It's a cliche and a little over played, but most of our classes have 20-30 IT experts sat in it.</p> <p><strong>It's not about one approach (1:1) but many:</strong> It's about keeping young people and learning central to any change. This week has seen many, negative throw away comments condemning 1:1 approaches without any real substance being them. I would argue that you're not really a professional unless you are exploring all new ways of teaching and learning. Teachers should be modelling the life long learning that we expect to instil in our students and at least explore every possibility and remain open minded even if we don't embrace it.</p> <h2>Genevieve Smith-Nunes (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pegleggen\">@pegleggen</a>) teaches IT, computing and business at Dorothy Stringer School in Sussex. She is hub leader for <a href=\"http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/\">Sussex CAS</a> and she blogs at <a href=\"http://pegleggen.wordpress.com/\">Pegleggen.wordpress.com</a></h2> <p><strong>Shared learning is vitally important:</strong> This is the case for all phases of education. Group work with or without devices goes beyond just the subject knowledge. Being able to work and communicate effectively with others is a key life skill. Having access to technology means (if possible) working with people from other schools, countries or organisations</p> <p><strong>Inclusion can instil confidence:</strong> 1:1 devices are a great resources to enable students to feel included in difficult lessons. I add QR codes to help students with remembering formula or a worked example. This way everyone gets the same sheets so the student doesn't feel like the only one who doesn't understand.</p> <h2>Alan O'Donohoe (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/teknoteacher\">@teknoteacher</a>) is the principal teacher of ICT at Our Lady's High School, Preston. Through Computing At School, Alan has worked with others to raise the profile of computing in the curriculum. Find his blog <a href=\"http://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/\">here</a>.</h2> <p><strong>Encourage sharing:</strong> I think it's worth trying to ensure that learning remains a social experience. It's great having resources online like <a href=\"http://www.udacity.com/\">Udacity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\">Codecademy</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.codeavengers.com/\">Code Avengers</a>. However, if learners are using these resources independently and not sharing what they have learnt with others, it can be a shallow experience. If we are encouraging more use of 1:1 devices, we should also be encouraging more sharing of learning experiences.</p> <h2>Raxian, a reader and participant in the live chat</h2> <p><strong>Listen to those who know and save money:</strong> I think one major thing that is overlooked is very close and consistent consultation with young people from the beginning. They know what will work and what will not. Listening to young people could save you a fortune and save you a lot of time being wasted.</p> <p><strong>Co-ordination, not control:</strong> Self directed learning has a very long way to go in the UK. It requires a fundamental shift from the current way the role of the teacher is considered. The fact is, whether teachers begin to embrace it or not, young people have for the past ten years already anyway. A teacher that recognizes that a majority of learning can now happen outside the classroom, in the young person's own time and under the want of their own curiosity and interest, is a teacher who can connect on a level that is liberating for his or herself and for the class. But the teacher becomes more a coordinator of a plethora of learning that is generating itself, rather than the controller of one defined stream of learning that is class room bound and purely teacher defined. </p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.
