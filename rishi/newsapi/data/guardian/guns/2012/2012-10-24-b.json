  "<p>Roberto Mancini said his Manchester City side need \"a miracle\" after another demoralising defeat in the Champions League on a night when the manager's tactics were questioned by one of his players and he admitted the blame had to be apportioned in his direction.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/ajax-manchester-city-champions-league\" title=\"\">City's 3-1 defeat against Ajax</a> leaves Mancini's team bottom of Group D, with only one point from their three fixtures and struggling even to qualify for the Europa League. \"It's going to be very difficult for us now,\" Mancini said. \"There's one team [Borussia Dortmund] with seven points, one [Real Madrid] with six and one [Ajax] with three. If we win the last three games it will be very close. But it's difficult. It will be a miracle.\"</p> <p>Samir Nasri had given City a 22nd-minute lead before Siem de Jong equalised at the end of the first half and Ajax then took control after the break, Niklas Moisander's header putting them ahead before Christian Eriksen's deflected shot completed the scoring in the 68th minute.</p> <p>\"It was probably my fault because I prepared badly for this game,\" Mancini said. \"I didn't prepare the players and I'm at fault. When you prepare for a game sometimes it is a different to what you expect. Sometimes you think the game goes one way and it goes another. We played a bad game. We had a few chances to score but the players didn't really play well.\"</p> <p>Mancini started the match with a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 system, changing it early on to 4\u20134\u20132 and then abandoning that for 3\u20135\u20132 during the second half. His right-back, Micah Richards, questioned the changes after the match, making it clear there was opposition within the dressing-room to operating with a three-man defence.</p> <p>\"It's not something that we've worked on a lot, we're just used to a back four,\" Richards said. \"But the manager likes it and if we want to do well then we'll have to work harder on it. It's a hard system and I think the players prefer 4-4-2 but he's the manager and we'll do what he says.\"</p> <p>Mancini, however, suggested the problem was not solely about the way he set up his team, but also their attitude. \"I don't know what he [Richards] said but I don't want to have this. On the pitch we are always 11 players. If you have spirit and quality you can play in the Champions League. If you don't have it, you can't. When you play this game you must have spirit and it is my fault because I should have prepared differently for this game.</p> <p>\"We are a young club when it comes to the Champions League. This is only the second year we have played in this competition. We have three of four important players who are injured who have played in the Champions League every year. But this doesn't change anything. We missed chances. We made mistakes which usually we don't. We didn't have control of the game. Ajax were better on the ball. They moved better than us. Congratulations to them. Usually this is our play and we do this but tonight and against Borussia Dortmund we didn't.\"</p> <p>Mancini has used the tactic of publicly blaming himself on at least three previous occasions, the suspicion being that he is trying to create a smokescreen. On this occasion he was even willing to accept responsibility for Joleon Lescott being out-jumped for Moisander's goal, from a routine corner. \"It's my fault,\" he said. \"I didn't say to him to jump.\"</p>",
  "<p>Arsenal shot themselves in the foot with a below-par performance against Schalke. In the end, that was about as much shooting as they mustered, as they struggled to register a chance of genuine merit on a night that belonged to the German side. The Arsenal management are concerned that opportunities have dried up, and in a replica of their defeat at Norwich last weekend, they were beaten with barely a whimper in response.</p> <p>Steve Bould, the assistant manager who took charge with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger serving the last game of his three-match touchline ban, could not hide his disappointment. \"It is frustrating, of course. We've not played anywhere like we can,\" he said. \"We lack a bit of confidence for whatever reason. A lack of chances is not what we are accustomed to and we need to correct that. I don't know why that is. Coming off the international break we haven't performed. In the West Ham game [a 3-1 victory] we looked really sharp and confident and since the internationals we have looked jaded.\"</p> <p>It was indicative of quite how impotent Arsenal were that Bould conceded he would have been delighted with an outcome of 0-0. \"This is a tough competition and they are a good side that beat Borussia Dortmund at the weekend,\" he added.</p> <p>The attacking formation, with Gervinho in the centre flanked by a drifting Aaron Ramsey and subdued Lukas Podolski, hardly made Schalke's defence break into a sweat. In fact the only effort on target came late in the game from the teenage substitute Serge Gnabry. Further back, Arsenal did not function well either, with Andr\u00e9 Santos particularly vulnerable and error prone. The Brazilian's lapses contributed to both of Schalke's ruthlessly taken goals.</p> <p>Bould is hopeful that the return of one or two important names from the injury list will bring a lift before the visit of QPR on Saturday. Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are both in contention. \"They might be considered, I believe. It's not set in stone yet,\" said Bould. He also pointed to the need to cut out the habit of conceding the first goal. \"Scoring first will be a major plus for us at the minute. We have gone behind in the last five games. To keep coming back is tough at times. We might need an early first goal on Saturday. It wouldn't half help.\"</p> <p>Arsenal's captain, Thomas Vermaelen, was dejected by the fact his team could not improve on the abject display at Norwich. \"I'm really disappointed,\" he said. \"We lost on Saturday and we wanted to do better here. But it was a little bit the same story; we couldn't create enough chances to score goals and then at the end we conceded. It's difficult to explain.\"</p> <p>Wenger will be back in situ when Arsenal pick up the Champions League with the return game against Schalke in Gelsenkirchen. They trail the Bundesliga club in Group B and although they still have some breathing space ahead of the other contenders, Olympiakos and Montpellier, they need to improve their performances considerably to win the group. \"I'm sure we will perform a damn sight better next time,\" Bould added.</p> <p>Wenger endured this from the director's box with Stan Kroenke, the club's majority shareholder, also in attendance. A rare home defeat in the Champions League was hardly the ideal prelude for Thursday morning's AGM.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Hamer's brilliant, brittle melodrama of London's East End, originally released in 1947, came out two years before his masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36180/kind-hearts-and-coronets\" title=\"\">Kind Hearts and Coronets</a>. It shows the same masterly ensemble control. The film is in many ways a precursor to kitchen-sink movies like Saturday Night and Sunday Morning \u2013 and that huge, teeming market scene bears comparison with Carn\u00e9's Les Enfants du Paradis. It follows a typical Sunday in a working-class neighbourhood. It's raining of course, but there's nothing dull and Sunday-ish about what's going to happen. Googie Withers is Rose, a former barmaid who has settled for marriage with a dull but steady widower with children. Handsome escaped convict Tommy Swann (John McCallum) turns up in their garden shed, pleading for help: she and Tommy were once sweethearts and his reappearance rekindles dangerous memories of their passionate love. Instantly, respectable Rose gambles everything on helping Tommy beat the law. Jack Warner plays the fatherly copper and Sydney Tafler is Morry, the roguish bandleader carrying on with Rose's pretty stepdaughter. Could it be that everyone except Tommy is a prisoner in some way? The drama is managed without condescension and with enormous skill.</p>",

But the bailout was not necessarily against Romney's interests. The Republican nominee may even have made money on the deal.</p> <p>In an investigative report in <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/170644/mitt-romneys-bailout-bonanza\">the Nation</a>, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy author <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com/\">Greg Palast</a> traces how auto bailout money made its way to hedge fund investors who owned a parts manufacturer called Delphi. At least one of those investors, Paul Singer, managed at least $1 million from a blind trust belonging to Ann Romney.</p> <p>When the bailout worked for Delphi, Singer made money and the Romneys made money, Palast writes. If the Romneys did not know about their investment in Delphi, Palast writes, they should have figured it out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nevertheless, even if the Romneys were blind to their initial investment in Elliott [Singer's hedge fund], they would have known by the beginning of 2010 that they had a massive position in Delphi and would make a fortune from the bailout and TARP funds. Delphi is not a minor investment for Singer; it is his main holding. To invest in Elliott is essentially a \u201cDelphi play\u201d: that is, investing with Singer means buying a piece of the auto bailout.</p> </blockquote> <p>Palast lays out the case in an interview with Democracy Now <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/18/greg_palast_mitt_romneys_bailout_bonanza\">here</a>. The Romney campaign replied to the report in <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/transportation-report/automobiles/262839-report-romney-profited-153-million-on-auto-bailout-\">The Hill</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Romney's campaign did not deny that he profited from the auto bailout in an email to The Hill Wednesday afternoon, but it said the the report showed the Detroit intervention was \"misguided.\"</p> <p>\"The report states that Delphi had 29 US plants before the misguided Obama auto bailout, and just four after. Is this really what the president views as success,\" Romney spokeswoman Michele Davis said.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney would have taken a different path to turning around the auto industry,\" Davis continued. \"As President, Mitt Romney will create jobs and give American workers the recovery they deserve.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T22:04:54.151Z\">at 11.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088595895cb4897f0db5298\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T21:10:48.540Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a> calls<strong> Donald Trump's office</strong> to ask for his college records and passport records.

But campaigns depend on the media to get their messages out. A quid pro quo develops. Campaigns trade access for coverage. What's strange is when a campaign asks for coverage but wants the access part to be invisible. Case in point: asking for a newspaper endorsement based on an off-the-record conversation.</p> <p>President Obama agreed to speak with the Des Moines Register this week about the election and why the paper should endorse him. But then the White House made the conversation off the record.</p> <p>The story might have ended there, with the Register editors deciding to endorse without ever releasing the nature of their conversation with the president.</p> <p>But Register editor Rick Green wrote a <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/OPINION/121024001/Register-editor-Obama-off-record-comments-deserve-shared-voters?nclick_check=1\">blog post</a> Tuesday evening about the strange stipulation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president\u2019s vision for a second term. He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection. [...]</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we discussed was off-the-record. It was a condition, we were told, set by the White House. [...]</p> <p>We requested that the White House be asked to reverse course so whatever the president shared with us could be reviewed by voters and our readers.</p> <p>No reason was given for the unusual condition of keeping it private.</p> <p>We relented and took the call. How could we not? It\u2019s the leader of the free world on line one.</p> </blockquote> <p>Green's post caught the attention of Register readers and other media outlets. Speculation cropped up that the president had said something the White House did not want to be released. Questions about the off-the-record condition threatened to eclipse whatever impact an endorsement might have. There was the uncomfortable fact that Governor Romney had conducted an extensive, hourlong interview with the paper that he allowed <a href=\"http://bcove.me/bin26964\">to be filmed</a>.</p> <p>The White House then suddenly reversed course, conceding to the newpaper's request to release details of the conversation. The paper published the <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/NEWS09/121024003/After-editor-s-blog-President-Obama-releases-transcript-of-Register-interview?Frontpage\">transcript of the conversation</a> online today.</p> <p>The bombshell in the transcript? No bombshell. Obama said a couple things slightly differently than he has said them before. The <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/barack-obama-des-moines-register-latinos_n_2008920.html?1351092307\">Huffington Post</a> highlighted this passage about the Latino vote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,\" Obama&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/NEWS09/121024003/President-releases-transcript-of-Register-interview?Frontpage&amp;nclick_check=1\">said on a call</a>&#xa0;Tuesday with the Register's publisher and editor, which was originally meant to be off the record. \"Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Register will make its endorsement Saturday night.</p> <p>In 2008 the Register <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20081025/OPINION03/810260320/Register-editorial-board-endorses-Obama-President\">endorsed</a> Obama, writing, \"Obama has earned the Register's endorsement for the presidency because of his steadfastness in the face of uncertainty, his clear-eyed vision for a more just America and his potential for rallying the country to do great things.\"</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T18:35:02.120Z\">at 7.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50882a7ab5794584b1c13ef3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T17:50:50.408Z\">6.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The daughter of <strong>former candidate</strong> Jon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HuntsmanAbby/status/261159889169174528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Attention GOP male candidates, 9.7 million more women voted than men in 2008.

  "<p>The Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, has threatened to arrest international election monitors invited by liberal groups to observe the conduct of next month's presidential vote in states accused of attempting to disenfranchise minorities. </p> <p>Abbott has written to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe <a href=\"https://www.oag.state.tx.us/newspubs/releases/2012/102312abbot_letter.pdf\">warning that its monitors have no right</a> to monitor the vote even though they have observed previous US elections. </p> <p>\"The OSCE's representatives are not authorized by Texas law to enter a polling place. It may be a criminal offence for OSCE's representatives to maintain a presence within 100 feet of a polling place's entrance,\" he said. \"Failure to comply with these requirements could subject the OSCE's representatives to criminal prosecution for violating state law.\"</p> <p>The OSCE is sending 44 observers to voting stations across the US at the request of various groups, including the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union, because of \"an unprecedented and sophisticated level of coordination to restrict voting rights in our nation\". These include attempts by several states, including Texas, to introduce voter identification laws and other measures blocked by federal courts which have ruled they were motivated by racial discrimination. </p> <p>In his letter, Abbott glossed over the recent judgements striking down the Texas identification law and pointed to a supreme court ruling in a case involving another state. </p> <p>\"The OSCE may be entitled to its opinions about voter ID laws, but your opinion is legally irrelevant in the United States, where the supreme court has already determined that voter ID laws are constitutional,\" Abbott said.</p> <p>The US routinely sends poll watchers to elections in foreign countries, particularly those where there are concerns about the fairness of the vote. <br>In television interviews, Abbott denounced the OSCE as an interfering foreign body even though the US is a founding member and it was invited by President George Bush's administration to monitor the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections in the US. </p> <p>\"If OSCE members want to learn more about our election processes so they can improve their own democratic systems, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the measures Texas has implemented to protect the integrity of elections,\" Abbott wrote. \"However, groups and individuals from outside the United States are not allowed to influence or interfere with the election process in Texas. This state has robust election laws that were carefully crafted to protect the integrity of our election system. All persons \u2013 including persons connected with OSCE \u2013 are required to comply with these laws.\"</p> <p>The OSCE responded later on Wednesday in a letter to the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, calling Abbott's threat \"unacceptable\" and noting that the organisation's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has an agreement with the US permitting it to monitor elections. </p> <p>\"The United States, like all countries in the OSCE, has an obligation to invite ODIHR observers to observe its elections,\" it said. \"The threat of criminal sanctions against OSCE/ODIHR observers is unacceptable.\"</p> <p>A Florida congressman running for the Senate, Connie Mack, also waded into the debate, saying that reports the United Nations wants to send election monitors was an outrage. The OSCE was founded under the UN charter.</p> <p>\"The very idea that the United Nations - the world body dedicated to diminishing America's role in the world - would be allowed, if not encouraged, to install foreigners sympathetic to the likes of Castro, Chavez, Ahmadinejad, and Putin to oversee our elections is nothing short of disgusting,\" he <a href=\"http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/?p=39436\">told the Orlando Sentinal</a>. </p> <p>\"The United Nations should be kicked off of American soil once and for all. And the American people should demand that the United Nations be stopped from 'monitoring' American elections. The only ones who should ever oversee American elections are Americans.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was a small point of law, well-spotted by the lawyers, but it may have changed the landscape \u2013 the equivalent of the <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/237038\" title=\"\">cloud no bigger than a man's hand</a> that grows into a storm. On Wednesday, the supreme court ruled that some out-of-time equal pay claims could come before the civil courts. It could, at last, be the moment when local authorities abandon the hopeless cause of resisting equal pay claims. It is a critical victory, but it is not the end of the war. The new battleground is the private sector, where those women who escape from lower-paid jobs are, according to <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/tucfiles/251.pdf\" title=\"\">TUC research</a>, penalised by a gender pay gap twice as big as it is in the public sector.</p> <p>Since the Equal Pay Act came in more than 40 years ago, it had seemed that the six-month cut-off point for unfair pay claims heard by employment tribunals was unbreachable. As a result, hundreds of thousands of women missed their chance of justice. The ruling that cases beyond the six-month limit could, after all, be heard in the civil court makes it possible to launch claims up to six years after leaving an employer. That delivers a deserved windfall to the low-paid cleaners, cooks and care assistants of Birmingham who retired or left before the council recognised their rights, and it also opens up the chance for thousands more women reluctant to challenge discriminatory employers while they still work for them, or in the same sector. Meanwhile, Birmingham, at a time of desperate cuts, is left with a huge bill for fighting and losing a battle it should have conceded years ago.</p> <p>The Equal Pay Act was a grand gesture in the dying days of a failing Labour government. Designing legislation that would successfully change the way people behaved was a novelty and its passage was a stitch-up between patriarchal unions and patriarchal employers. A five-year gap before implementation was meant to allow employers to equalise pay. Instead it allowed thousands of jobs to be reassigned to women only, perpetuating the undervaluation of women's work. Fighting cases is tricky, because an individual rather than a trade union or the equalities commission has to bring the case. The process was made worse by job segregation, because it made it near impossible to find a comparator to prove men got more for doing similar work. Where attempts have been made to make the law work better, they've been piecemeal: amendment on amendment, overlaid by EU law to produce something so dense that it's incomprehensible to all but specialist lawyers. Above all, the law is about providing a remedy when it has been broken, not about trying to shape the environment to encourage compliance. And when finally a serious attempt at reform was made, it again came at the end of a Labour government heading for defeat. The Equalities Act 2010 repeats its predecessor's mistakes. Its postdated proposals for pay transparency lie unimplemented and ignored by the coalition.</p> <p>Yet, although the women who marched on parliament on Wednesday<a href=\"http://ukfeminista.org.uk/events/feminist-lobby-of-parliament/\" title=\"\">under the UK Feminista banner</a> rightly protest at the distance still to travel before women are treated equally, the world is transformed since equal pay law was first introduced. Nearly as many women as men now work. The pay gap <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/economics/2012/07/were-solving-pay-gap-wrong-way?destination=node%2F187943\" title=\"\">is better understood</a>. It can be seen to be clearly linked to events in women's lives \u2013 motherhood, caring responsibilities, an interrupted work record (nearly half of all low-paid women earn even less when they return to work). And last year the pay gap for workers on median hourly pay was actually narrower than it has ever been.</p> <p>Hold the cheers. It is true that women's pay has been rising faster than men's, but that's not as exciting as it sounds. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/economics/2012/07/were-solving-pay-gap-wrong-way?destination=node%2F187943\" title=\"\">Men's pay is static,</a> and fathers' pay has actually fallen as more men work part-time. Families are faring worse than other groups. The parent penalty is falling more equally, but that just means more children are in poverty. Affordable childcare and higher-quality part-time work are at last issues for men as well as women. A new equality is emerging, but it's an equality of misery.</p>",
  "<p>Long the voice of the voiceless in Iran, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nasrin-sotoudeh\" title=\"\">Nasrin Sotoudeh</a> requires every ounce of her extraordinary courage to avoid being silenced herself. As a lawyer, she spoke out for the rights of her imprisoned clients and other women, but was then banged up herself \u2013 the price she paid for telling the truth. She's resisted the brutal regime at Evin prison, refusing to wear the regulation full-length chador, even though this meant being denied visits from her children. \"I know that you require water, food, housing, a family, parents, love, and visits with your mother,\" <a href=\"http://persian2english.com/?p=23128\" title=\"\">she reportedly wrote</a> to her kids, but \"just as much, you need freedom, social security, the rule of law, and justice.\" Comparisons with heroines like Aung San Suu Kyi (once also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19667956\" title=\"\">separated from her children</a>) are hard to resist. Now, with her own lawyers jailed and family harassed, she has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/iran-urged-release-nasrin-sotoudeh\" title=\"\">gone on hunger strike</a>. It is the last stand available; it ensures that Iran's hunger for change will be known.</p>",
  "<p>Some people are claiming this as a week in which the government's U-turns hit triple figures before we even got to Wednesday. This is a bit rich. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/badger-cull-postponed-2013\" title=\"\">Badgers stopped holding their breath on Tuesday</a>, and the decision to un-close, or consider un-closing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/22/jeremy-hunt-closure-childrens-heart-units\" title=\"\">children's heart units</a> came on Monday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-live-reaction\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell, though, was toast by Friday</a>, so really it's three U-turns spanning two weeks.</p> <p>But the debate is not about whether they got lucky on the calendar, but whether to call this a U-turn. Tories insist that these are actually postponements, or halts, or pauses. If you consider the behaviour in the terms of the driving metaphor whence the image came, a U-turn would be by far the best thing to do: you changed your mind, but&#xa0;at least you were decisive and&#xa0;didn't&#xa0;just sit in the middle of the road, annoying everyone.</p> <p>However, the entire concept is understood in Westminster as being far larger than simply changing your mind. The act of U-turning is thought to convey disarray and incompetence; a lack of control and internecine infighting; crucially, a failure of mettle at the most fundamental level; a failure to be Margaret Thatcher, and therefore a failure to create an atmosphere of government in which its sagacity on individual matters has ceased to be questioned, as its fitness to govern has been accepted as fact. Put like that, it doesn't look good. And yet, I think this is a lobbyist's fallacy. To a normal person, changing one's mind following reasonable, sustained argumentation from a number of reputable sources is not a sign of weakness, it's just a sign that you're awake.</p> <p>However, there I go, conjuring up the \"normal person\"; following Mitchell's demise, plenty on his side insisted that the \"normal person\" didn't care what he'd said to a policeman. The normal person (I'm going to give over with the inverted commas, you've got the message) didn't know that \"pleb\" was a snobbish word, he or she just assumed it meant \"moron\"; the normal person couldn't pick George Osborne, let alone Mitchell, out of a lineup; and polls, furthermore, proved as much.</p> <p>You can split hairs about this. Some polls thought he should resign, some didn't; 90% of Sun readers thought he should go from the off, so you can make of that what you will (here's what I make of it: in Cameron's shoes, Tony Blair would have fired him immediately. But I didn't like that modus operandi either. In an ideal world there'd be some middle ground between reacting immediately to anything a tabloid said and holding on to your position for dear life, until someone had to prise your fingers off it, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Last!\" title=\"\">Harold Lloyd</a>).</p> <p>Or you could say, that's not the point. Mitchell had to go not because he was uppermost in the public mind but because he is a snob. You can't govern people you despise. The problem isn't his public face, it's what's going on behind his face. In other words, it doesn't matter what the normal person thinks, if the answer is the normal person hasn't thought about it very much; there are plenty of aspects of government that normal people haven't given much thought to, but are nevertheless vital to the way things are run and have a defining impact on many normal lives.</p> <p>As Stuart Hall has said, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/feb/11/saturday-interview-stuart-hall\" title=\"\">\"Politicians always talk about what the people feel, but there is no such thing as a 'the people'. It's a discursive device for summoning the people that you want.\"</a></p> <p>In fairness, most people use the device as a last resort, when the decision&#xa0;has already gone against them \u2013 so what that Mitchell resigned? You may think you've won, but normal people don't care. It both summons the \"normal\", and insults the victor with abnormality, which they don't mind, because they've already won.</p> <p>Politicians and commentators seeking to swing an issue before it's been decided usually try to refine their definitions, with the deployment of some judiciously chosen apolitical traits \u2013 so they might address themselves to strivers or the hardworking; to mothers or parents; to women or \"grown-up\" women. (This is an old school Tory favourite: \"grown-up women don't need you telling them what to do for their childcare arrangements\", they say, when you suggest that cutting the childcare allowance might cause hardship. However poor you are, if you are a proper grown-up, you put your desire not to be patronised above your desire to pay your rent. Apparently.)</p> <p>What we're really looking at is a crisis of authority, a creed of \"I'm their leader, I must follow them\". The crucial problem with normal people \u2013 along with hardworking families and grown-up women \u2013 is that they don't all agree. Nobody knows what normal people think about U-turns, or about Mitchell, or about heart hospitals. You can poll them, interpret the results, appropriate their answers, mimic rhetorically what you think is in their hearts, and all you'll have is a circuitous route to looking even more craven than you did before. Better by far to say, I don't care what normal people think; I'm relatively normal, and this is what I think.</p> <p>Badgers are a bit different, of course. All normal people care about badgers.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamable:</strong> Good evening and welcome to what should be a glorious dreamcoat of a game; a technicolour symphony that should light up Europe. After all, it pits the champions of Germany v the champions of Spain. Jurgen Klopp v Jose Mourinho. More than a dozen world-class players on show. And two offenses that couldn't be more high-tempo if they were soundtracked by an 80s aerobics disco beat. </p> <p>It has all the makings of a classic*. Admittedly Dortmund are struggling in the Bundesliga, having won just once in their last five games and conceding nine goals in the process. But if the side that ripped through Manchester City at Eastlands shows up, they have a live shot at winning this. Meanwhile Real will be taking aim at history. They have scored in 13 successive Champions League away games and a goal tonight will put them level with the record holders Bayern Munich (2005-2009) and Barcelona (2009-2012).</p> <p>* It's going to be 0-0, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news: </strong> Mario G\u00f6tze, who was doubtful for this, starts for Dortmund. Madrid, meanwhile, are without all three of their left-backs, Marcelo, F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o and Alvaro Arbeloa, who all picked up injuries during the international break - which means Michael Essien is shunted into an unfamiliar position in defence.</p> <p><strong>Dortmund:</strong> Weidenfeller, Subotic, Hummels, Piszczek, Schmelzer, Kehl, Bender, G\u00f6tze, Reus, Grosskreutz, Lewandowski.</p> <p><strong>Real Madrid:</strong> Casillas, Varane, Essien, Pepe, Ramos; Khedira, Alonso, \u00d6zil, Di Maria, Ronaldo, Benzema.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Random question to everyone reading this:</strong> What's been your favourite German football ground experience? I'll start things off with FC Union Berlin beating Paderhorn 5-4 in September 2009. Nine goals, a raucous but friendly atmosphere, 10 euros to get in, beer on the terraces; there was a lot to like. Australia drawing 2-2 with Croatia the 2006 World Cup was pretty special too; as was Graham Poll's performance.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Before the official Uefa-approval Champions League anthem blasts out ... </strong> ... there's a schmultzy version of You'll Never Walk Alone for the crowd to enjoy. Judging by the TV shots, many of the 75,000 in the crowd aren't shy in taking advantage...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>We're off</strong> Real, kicking from right-to-left, get the game underway, \"If I were any good with editing I'd have gotten a Reus v Ozil fight night type trailer for this one,\" says David Fallon. \"Surely this should be an absolute stonker of a game?\" Here's hoping.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Real are content to play the ball along the back, happy to feel their way into this. But Dortmund want to harry like alley cats, and win a throw-in in a dangerous area when Essien dawdles and makes a mistake. It comes to nothing, mind.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> Nearly a chance there: Ronaldo's flick put Benzema in, but he was ruled offside.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6 min</strong> That, however, was a chance. Ronaldo jinked down the left and slashed it across goal but Ozil, six yards out, completely missed his kick. Madrid have started much the better here.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> Dortmund are still yet to put together a move worthy of their last two seasons. It's all very patchy.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>10 min</strong> It's still a little understated, with players slipping all over the place on a surface that's Little Chef fry-up greasy, but Real are the better side.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> A Dortmund corner evades everyone. \"Barca yesterday, Real Madrid tonight - good to see that a metaphorical 25-years-and-a-golden-watch MBMer like yourself doesn't get stuck with the diddy teams,\" chirps Ryan Dunne. Hmm. \"Re: 80s discobeat and soundtracks generally. Rather than playing about with new interfaces (like the fancy Olympics one) surely providing live, action-appropriate musical soundtracks would be the next logical step for MBMers? You could use Radiohead's Treefingers for dull, Stoke games, have witty themes for particular players and so on. On the downside, this would mean that one couldn't combine following MBMs with watching Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\" Where do we pay the royalties, Ryan?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Much nicer from Dortmund now. The passing is quick, crisp; the movement quick-cops-are-coming sharp. Kehl even tries his luck from distance, but Casillas palms it away.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> A Gotze speculator is blocked by Ramos, I think, before Lewandowski flicks over. This is decent from Dortmund. \"My favorite match in a German ground was a German Cup second round tie in fall of 2003 between SC Freiburg and Schalke,\" says Andy Palmquist. \"I was on university semester abroad in Freiburg and enjoyed going to the (then-known-as) Dreisamstadion, a small ground tucked up against the Black Forest. The match was an entertaining back and forth affair that was tightly poised at 3-3 after 90 minutes. Whereupon Freiburg - also known as the Badische Brazilians - went on and smashed in four more goals in the extra 30 minutes to win 7-3. And after which this American spectator was unbelievably hooked on football.\" Wow, sounds like some game. And Freiberg's a lovely town too...</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min</strong> Madrid are going to make a change here: Modric is stripped off and ready to replace Khedira who has a twanged hamstring. That seems a rather bold move ...</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Di Maria skies one following a lovely run, which involved jinking past two players and a YouTube reel 180-degree turn.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Meanwhile Ben Thomas emails in with this German ground experience, \"Every time I managed to catch a 1860 game whilst regularly flying back and forth to Munich to see my Bavarian girlfriend of the time. 2005-2006 season. Pretty average team but brilliant fun and still follow them to this day. I'm even drinking a Lowenbrau as i type this.\" So you watched an average German team and, er, what am I missing?</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> It's a decent enough game, but it's yet to catch fire. A plus for Real Madrid: Modric has settled nicely into the playmaker role and is pinging it around nicely. A negative: Ronaldo, when played in by Ozil, 12 yards out or so, shoots over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>27 min</strong> Gotze's side-footer from from edge of the box is helped over the bar by Casillas, who then flaps at the resulting corner.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Meanwhile Matt Dony emails in. \"I don't fully understand the whole Pirate Cloud Torrent malarky, but I'm pretty sure the Internet has negated any need for royalties,\" he says. \"And, sorry Ryan, but some plodding, unreconstructed Manowar would better soundtrack Stoke. I think smug, artsy, takes-themselves-oh-so-seriously Barca would call dibs on Radiohead.\" Wouldn't Barcelona be something light and lush, with an unexpected edge? Like Isobel Campbell singing with Mark Lanegan?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Just when it looks like a Subotic error might let Benzema in, the defender recovers and 75,000 souls exhale.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> It's still a bit new woolly jumper scratchy. \"Favourite German experience?\" asks Duane Pena. \"Right there in the Westfalenstadion, June 10 2006. Trinidad and Tobago vs Sweden. 10 man T&amp;T held off Sweden and Zlatan Ibrahimovich at his profligate best. Shaka Hislop performed like the Berlin Wall in goal and at the end 10,000 odd Trinidad and Tobago fans sang and dance for hours inside and outside the stadium.\" Bet that was a night. I was instead at England v Paraguay that day. No one was dancing for hours after that ...</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Dortmund 1-0 Real Madrid (Lewandowski 36)</strong> What a mistake from Pepe who plays it straight to Bender (I think), who feeds it to Lewandowski, who smashes it home!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL Dortmund 1-1 Real Madrid (Ronaldo 39)</strong> Well, that didn't last long. A long, diagonal pass/thump from Ramos dissects the Dortmund defence and Ronaldo waits for Weidenfeller to charge into no-mans-land for lofting it into an empty net.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> Dortmund are pressing again, but a silky interchange of passes down the left ends when Gotze - wrongly - is ruled offside. \"Thanks for the mention - what are you missing you wonder?\" asks Ben Thomas. \"The glory of German second division mid-table mediocrity my friend that's what. Oh and beer.\" Ah, yes.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Ramos clatters into Schmelzer, much to his disgust, but the referee is happy to keep his cards in his pocket. Don't think we've had one yet.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> Casillas saves a Gotze trundler without difficulty. \"Whilst I understand you're looking for best German football experiences - I could supply many from my time watching the illustrious SV Babelsberg 03 in Potsdam, just outside of Berlin - world leaders in the ticket+beer+wurst=change from \u00a310 - can I throw in my worst?\" asks Michael Wood. Be my guest. \"I once took a very nice but staunchly anti-football girl to Berlin's Olympiastadion in an attempt to show her what everyone got so excited about. However I chose to take her to a late January relegation six-pointer between Hertha and Moenchengladbach, in -12 temperatures, in a stadium which, whilst architechturally impressive, lacks any enclosed spaces whatsoever to get out of the cold. Both sides dutifully played out a nil all draw, the only incident being a missed penalty just before half time, which we managed to skip whilst attempting to find somewhere to cower during the interval. Needless to say, both sides eventually departed the Bundesliga, and our relationship didn't even make it to the end of the season...\" I'm amazed it lasted that long given you took a girlfriend who does like football to a rubbish game in -12 temperatures ...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Two minutes of injury time pass without incident and that's half-time. It's not been a thriller, but it did open up when Modric came on and you'd expect more goals here.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> We're off again. Meanwhile Holly McGuire makes the following astute observation. \"Whenever you try to impress an anti-football friend or lover with football, it will be a 0-0 game in inclement weather. Guaranteed.\" True.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> Dortmund are immediately on the attack but Reus is bumped and buffeted and eventually crowed out. \"Shouldn't you get some royalties for having invented the MBM format Sean?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Oft copied, but never bettered.\" You should be my agent, Gary ...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Yellow card for Sergio Ramos, who studs Schmelzer in a place where the winter sun's rays rarely reach.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 min</strong> Save from Casillas ... but arguably a bigger miss by Gotze! The ball is pinged around down the Dortmund right, Piszczek crosses, Lewandowski steps over, and Gotze - 12 yards out and central - hits it too close to the Madrid keeper.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Dortmund are pressing here. They sniff blood. \"You're an effete bunch of ne'rdowells,\" splutters Ian Tasker. \"Isobel Lanegan! Who the feck's that?\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> Real fast break, with Ronaldo hoping to inflict some spite down the left, but Hummels' brave diving header keeps Benzema out.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Now Di Maria drifts dangerously down the left but his shot from an acute angle misses the far post by a foot width. This is very open now. I wonder if it's still 1-1 at 75 minutes and Manchester City are still losing will a peace deal will be signed? Ifs. Ifs. Ifs.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>58 min</strong> More fine play down the right from Dortmund - one-touch, plenty of befuddling movement - ends when Bender leans back and lobs it over the bar. A wasted opportunity.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>60 min</strong> Hummels goes in high and late on Ozil, but there's no yellow card. \"I've never been to Germany but it sounds like a fun (and cheap) place to watch football, drink beer and eat sausage,\" says Simon McMahon. \"At those prices even the dullest 0-0 in Dortmund seems preferable to a dodgy pie and a 5-4 classic in Dundee.\" I don't want to sound like an employee of the German tourist board but you should go, it's a fantastic country.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> But Xabi Alonso does pick up a yellow for deliberately running into Gotze, who had just diddled him. The resulting free-kick, from 40 yards out in an area of semi-danger, comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Dortmund 2-1 Madrid (Schmelzer 64)</strong> Dortmund go ahead again! Casillas flapped completely unnecessarily at a cross from the left and only succeeded in pawing it out towards the edge of the 18-yard line ... and Schmelzer smashed it home!</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> For a millisecond Ozil looked to have a chance of immediate equaliser. But he shallied and shillied on the edge of the area and was crowded out. Modric then shoots over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> Dortmund sub: the excellent Bender off, Gundogan on.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> [Guardian reporter dons anorak] Possession stats: Dortmund 44% - 56% Real Madrid.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>72 min</strong> Real are about to bring on Higuain here, and they certainly need spice and fire to get back into this. Meanwhile Pepe fouls the rampaging Reus by - how to put this? - thrusting out his backside.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Real Madrid sub: Benzema - who has worked hard but not had many chances - off, Higuain on.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> Dortmund, who have been the main aggressors this half, have decided to hold onto what they have. Their full-backs aren't charging down the flanks like steam trains any more; and the midfield is just tucking in a bit too. It might not be the worst idea in the world - they might just be able to catch Madrid on the break.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Gotze goes down in the box after being strong-armed by Pepe. That could have easily been given, but the referee shakes his head and play goes on ...</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> There's delay as a fan charges on the pitch. Fortunately that's his last stupid act of the night as he's quickly bundled off. When play returns a long, raking throughball from Ozil comes <em>this</em> close to landing on Ronaldo's foot.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>82 min</strong> Dortmund are still in control but a corner comes to nothing. Meanwhile Andy Palmquist emails in: \"One more note on watching football in Germany: (at least in Freiburg), during the winter months they serve Gl\u00fchwein - hot mulled wine with spices. It makes for a nice alternative to pilsner when it's 25 degrees outside.\" Sounds like my kind of place.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> This is sprawling, open, unformed: you sense another goal may arrive at any moment. \"My memorable German stadium moment was in Hanover in Euro 1988, and missing Ronnie Whelan's classic goal because of a passing Mexican wave,\" says Jegs McGregor.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Di Maria scoots another long-ranger over the bar. Ronaldo and Di Maria have both threatened more than they've delivered tonight...</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> So much for Dortmund sitting this out. They had six attackers in that last attack. Meanwhile Schreiber, the Germany U21 international striker, replaces Gotze. Can they hold on?</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> This is more open than a Hollywood actress on a shrink's chair. But Real's final pass continues to lack any sort of precision. A superb run from Modric takes out three defenders but Di Maria's cross is blocked. The ball comes back into the area again but Essien does nothing with it on the back post.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90+1 min</strong> Dortmund make their final sub: Reus off, Perisic on. We have three additional minutes, can Real salvage an equaliser? It's not looking like it.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90+2 min</strong> The clock is ticking, and Real haven't got the ball ...</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>FULL-TIME</strong> Peep! Peep! That's it, it's over! Jurgen Klopp hugs his assistant then his players and with good reason: Dortmund are now top of the group on seven points, one clear of Real. Ajax, who beat Manchester City 3-1, are third on three points, with City last on one point. Thanks for all your emails. Best, Sean</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><br>Ajax have been champions of Europe four times. Which makes those three primary school-style stars on Manchester City's jersey seem a celebration of piffle. But this is not, of course, the Ajax of yore; rather, similar to Greek mythologists, we must distinguish between Ajax the Great and the current outfit, Ajax the Lesser. If my comprehensive knowledge of the classics (read: hasty consultation of a well-known web-based encyclopedia) is anything to go by, Ajax the Lesser had impressive potential, pulled off some marvelous feats but, ultimately, began to believe he was better than he really was and perished through his own hubris, drowning while attempting to walk on water. There could be a significant omen in there for this Ajax side ahead of tonight's encounter with the far better-resourced City. On the other hand, this opening could be complete waffle, in which case try the next paragraph instead. </p> <p>Right then. Fail to win here and City are as good as out of the Champions League at the first stage, again. And serial European flop Roberto Mancini could be as good as out of a job. Win here and City will live on to be outplayed by Real and Dortmund again before being knocked out. No English team is going to win the Champions League this year, are they? </p> <p><strong>Teams: </strong><br><strong>Ajax the Lesser:</strong> Vermeer; Van Rhijn, Aldenweireld, Moisander, Blind; Schone, Poulsen, Eriksen; Sana, De Jong, Twitter's Ryan Babel<br>Subs: Cillessen, Enoh, Sulemani, Boerrigter, Veltman, Dijks, Fischer<br><strong><br>City:</strong> Hart; Richards, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy; Milner, Tour\u00e9, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Pantilimon, Sinclair, Kolarov, Tevez, Nastasic, Balotlli, Evans</p> <p><strong>Ref: </strong>S Moen (Norway)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Mancini explains his selections:</strong> \"We had a players who spent a lot of energy on Saturday because we played for 70 minutes with one player down so I need fresh players for tonight.\" He also explains that Pablo Zabaleta is not fit but should be OK for Saturday; and that he reckons his team could be particularly dangerous form set-pieces tonight.\"</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.37pm: \"As an Ajax fan, while I certainly agree that this is indeed Ajax the Lesser, I don't think Ajax thought it was better than it really was (although that is indeed a real Ajax quality),\" howls Simon Broekema, who has misunderstood my intricately-compiled analogy. \"Rather, the Bosman ruling made it extremely difficult for Ajax to hold on to the talented players they had either grown themselves or scouted successfully. May I remind you that if you could make any team now featuring former Ajax players, that team would feature players like Sneijder, Van der Vaart, Nigel de Jong, Huntelaar, Ibrahimovic and Suarez. In any case, the Lesser Ajax is now a team full of young puppies, and they are unfortunately going to get destroyed tonight.\" That last bit is what I was driving at: they may have bitten off more than they can chew with this Champions League campaign.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>Aside: As yet another ad for the latest James Bond movie blazes across my screen, I would like to formally register my disdain for this sort of thing. This ubiquitous marketing campaign for the new film, all designed to convey the notion that this release is some kind of vital cultural event, has put me right off seeing it. As has the fact that the last, ooooh, at least five Bond movies have been increasingly atrocious. Casino Royale was a nadir. Pure dross. And a poker scene shoehorned in to chime with the times but which, alas, made no sense whatsoever.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>7.43pm: Anyway, speaking of vital cultural events, we've just had the Champions League theme. Always makes the hairs on the palms of my hands stand up.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> City kick off, and within second hoof the ball long towards Dzeko. A sign of things to come? Ajax deal with it easily.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Ajax are endeavouring to play their usual brand of slick and expansive football but it's all a bit patchy so far, and City haven't shown much either. Indeed, they have had little of the ball. In other news, here's <a href=\"http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Oct/rio-and-anton-ferdinand-issue-statement.aspx\">a statement from Rio and Anton Ferdinand about matters you may have heard of</a>.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Ajax are looking the more coherent. A nice one-two twixt Babel and De Jong concludes with the latter curling a shot well over the bar from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Ajax give the ball away in midfield, granting City a chance to come forward for the first time in the game. Do they try to build a meaningful attack? No, Dzeko tries to smash the ball into the net from 35 yards. And fails miserably, his feeble effort trickling harmlessly wide. \"You are lucky, Paul: we have incessant ads for who will make the best president, senator, congressman, dog catcher, floor sweeper et al,\" groans Geoff Ashworth, who presumably lives in Gambia.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Lovely effort! Again City were guilty of being too meek as Ajax played their way skilfully through them. They worked it quickly to Schone at the edge of the City box and the Dane fed it back to Eriksen, who cracked a vicious volley inches wide from 20 yards. Hart wouldn't have got to that.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> The Champions League is all about clashes between the planet's biggest stars. So I should tell you that the big Christian Poulsen-Gareth Barry duel has been pretty even so far.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> City build a threatening more for the first time, with Aguero heavily involved. After his team zip the ball about with more speed and purpose than they had previously summoned, the Argentinian tried to skedaddle his way into the box ... and he would have gotten away with it too, if it not for some excellent meddling by Alderweireld at the edge of the box.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Here's a worry: Yaya Tour\u00e9 is down injured. The replay does not reveal anything particularly damaging in the challenge by Blind so Tour\u00e9 may be able to continue. \"When I hear the injured players left behind are mostly the new ones, am I the only City fan who feels relieved they're not there and Mancini's got less choice about sticking with what's worked in the past?\" barks Paul Ruffley. City sure done botched their summer recruitment.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> This Ajax may be The Lesser compared to their Great forefathers, but they're currently a good deal better than City, for whom, at least, Tour\u00e9 has just returned to the pitch after getting his ankle strapped.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> As Ajax continue to circulate the ball nicely around a desperately passive City side, Gary Neville is asked by fellow Sky commentator about his memories of playing against Ryan Babel. \"I remember that whenever the ball came to his feet he seemed to be having an argument with it.\" Gary Neville, a prince among pundits!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Eriksen, playing as a false nine, is becoming ever more influential and executing some delicious moves. He just intigated another flowing Ajax attack before arriving at the end of it to flummox Barry before firing just wide from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 0-1 City (Nasri 22')</strong> City score with a splendid counter-attack, their first of the game! Richards began it with an excellent pass to Milner, who slid it wide to Nasri, who, having charged in unmarked from the left, struck it first time past the keeper and into the corner of the goal form 17 yards. A classic sucker punch.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> The match has quickly reverted to its pre-City goal pattern, with Ajax dominating play but showing little hint of a cutting edge. \" Come on Paul, I'm no Alan Partridge-level Bond devotee but, surely, Casino Royale -with a proper, gritty actor at its heart - was better than prety much all Brosnan Bonds!\" fumes Ryan Dunne. No! There was something about Brosnan that made it clear he knew how preposterous the Bond wheeze was. Not nearly as much as the brilliant Roger Moore, who always looked like he was trying to suppress a laugh and never looked like he could really beat anyone up, let alone a villain hellbent on global destruction. Daniel Craig seems to take it too seriously.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Ajax look quite ragged at the back when City do go at them. A routine move down the right suddenly results in Richards cantering into the box with a free shot on goal. He blems it hard but straight the keeper, who bats it away.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Nasri over-hits an intended pass to Aguero. If he'd got it right, the striker would have been in for number two.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> De Jong sweeps a fine cross-field ball to Van Rhijn, who has got in down the right behind Clichy. But then he loses the head and sends a curler over the bar when a pass to a well-placed team-mate would have been a wiser option. \"Kolarov must wonder what he has to do to get a start over Clichy (who has been poor so far this season), especially after his masterful display against Sunderland,\" parps Daniel Field. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see him heading back to Italy soon.\" Who would match his wages?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> City rumble forward again after absorbing lots of impotent Ajax possession. Milner finds Nasri in space on the left again but Van Rhijn gets across quickly to block the Frenchman's attempted cross-shot.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Ajax eschew an opportunity to send a cross into the box and instead take a short freekick from 30 yards. And then Schone dinks the ball straight into Hart's hands. Elsewhere in this group, Dortmund have just taken the lead against Madrid. Probably not what City want.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Schone has a whack from 25 yards. Into a canal it goes. Meanwhile, Ronaldo has just equalised for Madrid against Dortmund. \"The trouble with Bond movies is that they cannot make up their mind if they are serious films or not,\" sermonises Simon McMahon. \"Bond as depicted in the Fleming novels is a hard, unsympathetic character, whereas Bond on screen, and Daniel Craig in particular, is caught between portraying a serious role whilst having to put up with the inevitable one-liners and product placement. Connery remains the original and best, however.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Ajax continue to enjoy the majority of possession but have yet to look truly dangerous. \"Now, I've not bothered sitting through a Bond film since the one with the evil media mogul on a ship, but I'm pretty sure I would expect a poker scene in a film with Casino in the title,\" barfs Matt Dony. \"Wouldn't it have been odder to not have any gambling in it?\" Yes, but the scene itself made no sense, as in the dynamics of the game were wrong.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 1-1 City (De Jong 45')</strong> Did I say impotent Ajax attack? Not that time! Van Rhijn fired a cross to the edge of the area, where De Jong arrived at speed to batter a low shot into the net. Hart barely moved.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Ajax did not look capable of cutting City for most of that half but the moral of their fine equaliser is that if you let a side play around you for long enough, they will eventually punish you. City need to be more assertive in the second half; but Manicni will probably continue to try absorbing Ajax's pressure and strike on the counter-attack. It may work. But being bolder is more likely to bring joy here, in my opinion.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Bond blather:</strong> \"What English footballer could play James Bond?\" wodners Justin Kavanagh. \"There aren't many suave enough: Bobby Moore in his pomp maybe? Steve Gerrard's too scouse. David Beckham is too Hollywood. Gary Neville might be wry enough, but that high-pitched orgasmic reaction to the Torres goal might turn off women fans of Bond. The villain of course would have to be a Johnnie Foreigner with schemes of world domination, maybe a Johan Cruyff, pontificating on the state of the global game from his Barcelona lair.\" Ray Wilkins or Micah Richards would get my vote.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> \"City brought this on themselves,\" blasts Michiel Jongsma. \"Leaving their left back position completely exposed and no urge trying to kill off the game after that first goal... I don't know what they're doing. Ajax have been fragile mentally all season, drawing five games from nine in the league, throwing away two goal leads and stuff. If City won't take all three points, they have only themselves to blame.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> That's more like it from City! RIght from the resumption they tear forward, Nasri threading a pass through to Aguero. A fine tackle by Moisander thwarted his first shot and then the Argentinian clipped a cross into the centre but Ajax scrambled it away again.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Pleasingly, there is a higher pace to proceedings in this second half. Looks like Manci0ni has given his troops what for. Proper order. But will they sustain it? \"Danny Murphy would be a perfect Bond,\" trumpets Matt Dony. \"He would be sent by M (Karren Brady) to nullify the threat caused by Platini's evil schemes to wipe out the classic English footballing traditions of getting clubs into insanely deep debt and tackling like psychopaths. Along the way, Danielle Lloyd would try and catch his eye, then try to kill him, but one of Q's gadgets ( Joseph Barton) would see her off.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> City enjoy their longest unbroken spell of possession of the match. It ends when Nasri swipes the ball down the left for Dzeko to chase; the Bosnia gets there and fires in a decent cross that Barry nods wide from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Hats claims a corner with authority. Moments later City are down the other end threatening again, with even Tour\u00e9 getting involved around the opposing box, which he had singularly failed to do in the first half. City have certainly improved in this period.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Nasri escapes a booking despite a late tackle on Van Rhijn. So does Milner moments later (for a foul on Eriksen). In other news, my inbox is creaking under the volume of emails demanding that Scott Parker be hired to play Bond with immediate effect.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 2-1 City (Moisander 56')</strong> This is shoddy from City! Concding the corner in the first place was slack but their attempt to defend it was worse, as no one was near Moisander as he rose near the front post and directed a powerful downward header into the net!</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Milner attempts to recreate Tom Cleverley's cross for Javier Hernandez's second goal last night but Ajax defend it better than Braga did, as Van Rhijn heads behind for a corner. And that corner is then defended well too. City have got themelves into a right old pickle here. \"George Best could have played Bond,\" bugles Travis Dudfield. \"Sure, he was from Northern Ireland but who else had or has that kind of swagger?\" If we're broadening it out to include non-Englishmen (and why shouldn't we, given that Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan have played him), then my vote goes to Paolo Di Canio.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Dzeko penalised for leaping with the goalkeeper in a bid to connect with a loopy Nasri cross. Meanwhile, the Amsterdam Arena is rocking. \"If City fail to win this game (and thereby seriously endanger their chances of getting out of this group) because they, in stereotypical Italian fashion, lounged back on a designer divan on the edge of their own box after going 1-0 up with their first shot on target in the game, then Mancini's gonna seriously cop it,\" declares SB Tang, who's not wrong.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>City substitution: </strong> Looks like Mancini is going to switch to a back three: off comes Lescott, on comes Kolarov. Meanwhile, Tevez and Balotelli remains on the bench. Clichy is not looking best pleased about this defensive realignment and, it must be said, it hasn't worked very well previously this season.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> That's a delicious cross from the left from Kolarov. Milner throws himself at it but can't keeper his header down. \"For an English James Bond, look no further than Teddy Sheringham,\" blurts Tobin Druce, who has a point.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Now Ajax are sitting back, allowing City the ball around mid-way ... until Richards gives it away to Babel, who hurtles forward. Kompany gets back to tidy things up.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 3-1 City (Eriksen 68') </strong> City are in serious trouble! Barry ceded possession deep inside City territory and Sana helped the ball on to Eriksen, who shot from 20 yards takes a treacherous deflection off Clichy and wrongfoots Hart.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> The switch to three at the back has made a rabble of City, who nearly concede a fourth. Hart saves them, surging off his line to charge down a Sana shot after City were cut apart by a quick one-two. Moments later a long ball from the back flies over Ajax heads and into the path of Dzeko. It's Vermeer's turns to pull off a fine save.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>City substitution:</strong> Tevez on, Barry off.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Suddenly this game is wackily open! Dzeko twists his way into the box at one hand, beats the keeper but finds himself at too acute an angle to score so manoeuvres himself to a more conducive position, enabling Vermeer to recover and make another crucial block. Then Ajax break down the other end and Babel's low shot from the left is held by Hart.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Ajax switch:</strong> Sana off, Enoh on. Ajax are trying to shore up this lead.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Kolarov bnooked for an immoral challenge on Schone.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Nasri takes the ball down with a beautiful touch inside the Ajaax box but then falls over under a challenge from Moisander. Nothing doing, says the ref. Meanwhile, Mancini appears to have rejigged his defence again as his team switch to a Hail Mary formation. Meanwhile, Simon McMahon is back with a suggestion for a Bond-sinspired post-match interview. \"If it stays like this I'm hoping that Mancini's post match interview goes something like this: Mancini - 'Do you expect me to talk?'. Interviewer - 'No, Mr Mancini, I expect you to cry.'</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Balotelli is now on the pitch, in place of Milner. \"Two things,\" booms HT. \"Surely Berba's your Bond? Also, a propos foreigners, a bit disappointed with SB Tang's tasteless Italian bashing, has he forgotten Napoli or Juve against Chelsea, to name recent examples?\" Why do you think SB Tang is a foreigner?</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Freekick to City close to the corner flag on the right. Kolarov clatters it towards the near post. Vermeer punches it clear and Schone tonks it further away. It's not looking good for City.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> City dink the ball around their own half for a while, looking vainly for options. None occur to them, so Nasri lofts it long into the box. Something nearly comes of it as Dzeko nods it down to Aguero, who tries to wriggle his way into a shooting position but is eventually crowded out.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Mancini's tinkering has left City light in midfield so the defenders are just hitting it long. Dzeko is is doing his best to turn punts into passes but it's not very productive so far.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Aguero wins the ball just outside the Ajax bonx and slams a shot just over. \"Man City - the George Lazenby of Group D?\" chuckles Simon McMahon, who's in a rich vein of form.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Dzeko meets Kolarvo's corner. Vermeer's saves Dzeko's header.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Ajax substitution:</strong> Boerrigter on, Schone off.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Dezko does well to take down another long ball, then feeds Tevez, who forces another corner. Ajax deal with it competently.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> City have four minutes to save their Champions League campaign and redeem themselves.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Kolarov bangs a 25-yard freekick straight into the wall. \"Even Steve McClaren can conquer Dutch teams,' tweets Will Unwin.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> The sky has fallen in on City. The most expensively-assembled team of all time are bottom of their Champions League group and tonight were punished for a passive, disjointed and at times feckless performance. They took the lead against the run of play and then seemed to the think they had already done enough. After conceding an equaliser on the stroke of half-time, they played the first 10 minutes of the second half with pace and purpose. And then relented again. And then conceded two sloppy goals. All in all, this was no why for a team with their resources to perform against valiant but eminently beatable opponents. City may need to win all three of their remaining games to save themselves: play like they have done in their first three (or at least two of their first three) and they probably won't win any.</p>",
  "<p>Journey has won this year's <a href=\"http://prize.gamecity.org/\">GameCity prize</a>. The downloadable PlayStation title, in which players control a mysterious character on a quest through a haunting desert landscape, beat six other shortlisted titles to claim the award. </p> <p>The prize was judged by a panel of writers and broadcasters from outside the games industry, including Lord Puttnam, comic book artist Dave Gibbons, Financial Times journalist Lucy Kellaway and DJ Jo Whiley. The aim of the annual competition, which takes place as part of Nottingham's GameCity festival is to highlight interesting titles and to encourage debate and discussion about the state of game design. </p> <p>\"All of the Jury commented on the art direction in particular, the extraordinary sense of size and scale it portrayed,\" said Lord Puttnam. \"Whilst it was a short game, it was in no way small. It's a focused, detailed piece of work - challenging you to measure it in terms other than just the length of gameplay. One of the jury commented that it was like a favourite place, a walk in the country, that she would love to go back and revisit\".</p> <p>Created by US developer <a href=\"http://thatgamecompany.com/\">thatgamecompany</a>, Journey was released on Playstation 3 in March and drew widespread critical acclaim for its beautiful visuals, haunting soundtrack and elusive, thought-provoking design. It beat other well-receieved titles such as Proteus, Mass Effect 3 and Fez.</p> <p>Commenting on the win, the creative director of thatgamecompany, Jenova Chen said: \"I really like the goal of GameCity, to get people to notice games and talk about games, particularly for people who don't encounter many video games in their daily life. Thatgamecompany has always focused on making games for everyone, so it's nice to see GameCity recognize our game and give us an award. In the end, we believe that games are a mature media that deserve to be enjoyed and loved by everyone, by people\".</p> <p>Journey joins last year's victor Minecraft and the offbeat duo have set a tone for what some have referred to as gaming's answer to the Turner or Booker prizes. The GameCity festival continues until Saturday with a range of talks, showcases and evening events.</p>",
  "<p>Bank of America defrauded the US government in a scheme called \"the hustle\", federal prosecutors alleged on Wednesday as they sued the bank $1bn in compensation.</p> <p>The justice department filed a civil complaint in New York seeking recompense for some of the massive losses suffered by quasi-government controlled mortgage finance firms Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae following the collapse of the ill-fated housing boom.</p> <p>In a scheme that was \"spectacularly brazen in scope\" Preet Bharara, US attorney for the southern district of New York, said the bank \"made disastrously bad loans and stuck taxpayers with the bill\".</p> <p>The charges relate to Countrywide Financial, once the largest seller of sub-prime home loans. Countrywide was bought by Bank of America for $2.5bn in 2008 as the loan firm headed toward collapse. It has since cost the bank tens of billions of dollars in write-offs for bad loans, legal costs and settlements with government agencies.</p> <p>Bharara charges that the Bank of America continued Countrywide's abusive practices even after the purchase. \"Countrywide and Bank of America systematically removed every check in favor of its own balance \u2013 they cast aside underwriters, eliminated quality controls, incentivized unqualified personnel to cut corners, and concealed the resulting defects,\" he said.</p> <p>According to the suit, Countrywide operated a scheme called \"the hustle\", aimed at boosting the speed at which it originated and sold loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Bharara said that between 2007 and 2009 Countrywide and Bank of America axed normal quality control checks on loans and falsely claimed the loans qualified for insurance from Fannie and Freddie.</p> <p>The two government-backed entities were left with billions of dollars of bad loans after the housing market collapsed. According to top financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission Freddie Mac's sub-prime mortgage holdings had reached $244bn, or 14% of its portfolio, by 30 June 2008.</p> <p>This is the first time the justice department has gone after a bank suspected of selling bad loans to Fannie and Freddie.</p> <p>Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said Bank of America's Countrywide purchase had secured its place as \"the worst deal from hell\". But he questioned the decision to pursue a civil rather than criminal action.</p> <p>\"Once again this is a civil suit. Is anyone ever going to be held accountable? It seems that they are charging someone systematically removed the controls here that were meant to protect the mortgage market and Freddie and Fannie. Someone has to be accountable for that,\" he said.</p> <p>The suit is the second this month that Bharara has brought against banks over their role in the housing bubble. Earlier this month Bharara sued Wells Fargo, accusing it of deceiving government agency the Federal Housing Administration about the quality of its loans in order to get those loans insured.</p>",
  "<p>Amazon is to be stripped of its huge tax advantage on the sales of electronic books after the European commission ordered Luxembourg to close a VAT loophole.</p> <p>Amazon is registered as a Luxembourg company and pays that country's VAT charge of 3% when it sells an ebook to a British reader, rather than the 20% it would have to charge if it were UK-based.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed this week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/21/amazon-forces-publishers-pay-vat-ebook\" title=\"\">Amazon is forcing British publishers to cover the cost of a 20% VAT charge on ebook sales</a> even though the true VAT cost to the online retailer is a fraction of that.</p> <p>The European commission \u2013 which oversees European Union law as the EU's executive arm \u2013 on Wednesday gave Luxembourg 30 days to increase its VAT rate on digital services from 3% to 15%. This will close a tax loophole that has encouraged companies such as Amazon, Skype and Netflix to be based in Luxembourg to benefit from the 3% rate when selling throughout the EU. Luxembourg must agree to change its VAT rate before the end of November, or face being referred to the European court of justice and risk fines. France has also been issued with a similar warning over its 7% rate for digital services.</p> <p>Amazon is expected to contest the commission ruling, so there will be no immediate impact on the cost of ebooks bought from its UK website.</p> <p>Luxembourg, with the lowest standard VAT rate in Europe, has been successful at attracting many global e-services providers. Under EU rules these companies are able to charge consumers across the EU the reduced Luxembourg VAT rate for these services. The home state of the consumer who makes the purchase receives no tax revenues.</p> <p>Charging ebooks at the 3% rate gives firms such as Amazon a huge competitive advantage over UK ebook retailers, which have to charge the local rate.</p> <p>The commission issued infringement proceedings in July against Luxembourg and France on the grounds that their policy was incompatible with EU law. The next step, a reasoned opinion, was published on Wednesday. Luxembourg and France will rely on the defence that there is an anomaly in EU VAT law which allows paper books and newspapers, for instance, to be charged at a reduced VAT rate; but digital must be charged at the standard, higher rate of the country in which the company is based.</p> <p>The commission, which is being pressured by national online booksellers which lose out to Amazon's better margins on digital sales will demand that member states cannot act alone and must seek unanimity amongst all 27 states. Richard Asquith, Global Head of VAT, TMF Group, the indirect tax consultancy, said: \"Countries across the EU have been breaking ranks by charging cut-rate VAT on services sold across borders. Luxembourg's move at the start of 2012 to cut its ebook rate to only 3% to help attract and retain the media industry has been copied by France, and I expect Belgium to do the same. The UK has held out at the full 20% VAT rate, which has a detrimental impact on the UK industry. The EC's move will seek to end these anomalies and tax competition amongst member states, and comes under pressure from member states' ministers of finance.\"</p> <p>The EU's move against Luxembourg will please the British publishing industry. British authors and publishers are fearful that Amazon's market dominance will send the industry into decline with consumers facing a smaller and less varied choice of books from fewer authors on sale in fewer retail outlets.</p> <p>Amazon is able to wield such power over publishers because it has a near monopoly of the UK digital book market. According to industry estimates, it sells 90% of all ebooks in Britain, while using its Luxembourg tax status to squeeze profitable terms from publishers.</p> <p>According to a contract seen by the Guardian, Amazon starts negotiations with its publishers on the basis that the UK VAT rate of 20% must be knocked off the cost price. However, its base in Luxembourg allows it to benefit from the European tax anomaly and pay VAT at 3%. This means that Amazon can charge the difference between the UK VAT levy imposed on publishers and the 3% it actually pays, creating a supplementary profit of \u00a31.38 a \u00a310 ebook in Britain. It then negotiates further substantial discounts on top of the VAT subsidy, which can result in Amazon seeking a discount of up to 65% on ebooks including the phantom VAT charge.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson's suggestion (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/boris-johnson-free-schools\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 19 October) that the Greater London authority should be in a position to give practical effect to \"a shared vision\" for education in London is a sensible one. When a royal commission looked at London just over 60 years ago, it identified London-wide functions to be exercised by the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), then a committee of the Greater London Council. These functions included: the control and management of capital programmes; the year-by-year management of the revenue budget; and control over the disposition and organisation of educational institutions. These were all things that individual institutions could not themselves do.</p> <p>On becoming education officer to the ILEA, sounding rather like Johnson, I added that \"the authority has also to articulate the needs of education in London and, as it responds to national policy, contribute to the formation of that policy with those needs in mind\". Given some such responsibilities, the mayor could invite the secretary of state to hand him the hundreds of funding contracts he has with individual academies and \"free\" schools in London. After a decent interval, the mayor could then bin them. Individual funding contracts are, he would soon discover, an expensive and ridiculous way to manage a school system.<br><strong>Peter Newsam</strong><br><em>Education officer, ILEA, 1977-82</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008If, as you report, the mayor of London has no formal powers over school education, what then is the legal basis for Johnson's establishing, accommodating and funding his dedicated unit at City Hall, securing sites for free schools, or for his establishing a \"London curriculum\"? Legislative responsibility for providing school places in our capital lies with the borough councils, who also monitor and advise local authority schools. The mayor holds no such responsibility or remit.</p> <p>Through cuts in grants and pressure to hold down council tax, the coalition has starved councils of resources to perform our duties. Yet Johnson seems able to resource an area not in his mayoral remit, while cutting expenditure where the responsibility is clearly his. Should he wish to fund from his own pocket educational units of whatever kind, he is free to do so. The use of mayoral funds, while increasing transport fares and cutting the police on our streets, is no more acceptable that the Department for Education supporting Johnson's pet projects with funds for whose use local government has the greater need and expertise.<br><strong>Cllr Jeff Hanna</strong><br><em>Chair, Children and young people scrutiny panel, London borough of Merton</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The mayor has recognised that London's state schools are the most successful in England and Wales, so why is he promoting a whole set of free schools which will operate outside of local authority control? London's population is growing fast and the big challenge is creating 90,000 extra school places over four years. Free schools typically offer few places and are not always located in areas where demand is greatest. They will not provide a solution to the looming shortage. Instead of ploughing money into poorly planned, unaccountable free schools, the mayor should co-ordinate with local authorities to secure long-term investment for the building of new schools run by local councils who play a vital role in the education system.<br><strong>Darren Johnson</strong><br><em>Green party member, London assembly</em></p>",

  "<p>Two years from now, we will at last know the answer to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/alex-salmond-scotland-referendum-deal\" title=\"\">epochal question which David Cameron and Alex Salmond launched in Edinburgh last week</a>. By late October 2014, either Scotland will have voted to become an independent state, or Scotland will have voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. Yet the more you think about it, the harder it is to know which outcome actually carries the more demanding political implications.</p> <p>Like most people, my default setting is that a yes vote in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland\" title=\"\">independence referendum</a> would obviously be the larger moment. It would certainly be the bigger story. A 300-year-old union undone. A democratic divorce with few precedents. An extraordinary rebirth for a new old nation. An existential shock to the viability of what is known in the shorthand as the RUK \u2013 the rest of the UK. Reverberations across Europe, particularly in Ireland, Spain and Italy, and, further afield, in Canada too.</p> <p>But what about the alternative? What if Scotland votes to stay in? This is, after all, what the opinion polls consistently say is actually likely to happen. Even <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2012/oct/sunday-times-poll-shows-rising-yes-support\" title=\"\">the best poll for the nationalists in recent days</a> only has support for independence at 37%. Two others have been much lower \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/independence-blow-as-support-for-union-soars.19077088\" title=\"\">at 28%</a> and <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/latest-poll-shows-opposition-to-scottish-independence-rising.1350558326\" title=\"\">30%</a> respectively. The average hovers somewhere in between. The poll trend, at the moment, is actually against independence. And more often than not, referendums have a habit of confirming the status quo anyway.</p> <p>If you were betting on it, you would therefore have to say that Scotland is significantly more likely to stay in the UK than leave it. That's not, of course, to say a yes vote is inconceivable. Independence is a very real possibility. Salmond spends every day of his life trying to create a sense of historic inevitability around his cause. He is a formidable leader of the most effective political machine on these islands. And Scotland has many grievances and aspirations which can be channelled into&#xa0;the nationalist cause.</p> <p>But, as has become clear over the last few days, Salmond is not invincible. Three things have shown this. The first is Cameron's success last week in sidelining Salmond's attempts to get a home rule \"devo max\" question on to the ballot paper in 2014 alongside the independence question. Sure, this would boomerang against Cameron if Salmond manages to persuade Scots that independence is now the only way forward. Right now, though, it cramps Salmond's options and makes it harder for him to claim victory in 2014.</p> <p>The second warning sign was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/19/snp-conference-nato-debate-live-blog\" title=\"\">SNP's debate on Nato membership at its conference in Perth last Friday</a>. This debate, far and away the most interesting and knife-edge event in any party conference this autumn, ended in victory for Salmond's view that an independent Scotland should remain in Nato while removing the UK's&#xa0;Trident nuclear submarines from the Clyde. But it was a close-run thing and, although the SNP was understandably smug about its ability to have a serious argument in public, the political consequences may nevertheless be bad and lasting.</p> <p>I may be wrong, but it felt to me in the hall in Perth as though a little of the SNP's previously irresistible momentum slowed in that debate. Feelings ran very high. There were harsh words between what the German Greens used to call \"realos\" and \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundi_%28politics%29\" title=\"\">fundis</a>\". This week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/msps-resign-snp-nato-stance\" title=\"\">two SNP members of the Scottish parliament resigned the whip over the decision</a>. On this issue, this really is a divided party. And voters do not like division.</p> <p>The third sign of a certain unravelling of the SNP is this week's confusion about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20042069\" title=\"\">the legal advice given \u2013 or not \u2013 to Salmond about whether Scotland would seamlessly become a member state of the EU</a>, or whether it would have to apply as a new member. Salmond has always argued that Scotland and the RUK would inherit the UK's membership, and has always implied that the law is on his side. This week it became clear there was no legal advice. In effect, Salmond has been winging it. First ministers do that at their peril.</p> <p>A strong leader and a well-supported party \u2013 which Salmond is, and the SNP is \u2013 can survive events like these. But the SNP's electoral success, which shows little sign of faltering, is enormously dependent on Salmond's artful ability to persuade voters that it is worth taking a risk with him. In the space of 10 days, he has now lost the devo-max soft option in the referendum, presided over a party that can be portrayed as irresolute on Scotland's defence, and stands accused of playing a three-card trick over Scotland's place in Europe. Neither Salmond nor his cause can afford too many such setbacks. They are not immortal. They are not immune from the laws of politics.</p> <p>So what should happen if Scotland, as currently seems more likely, votes no? This question cannot be ignored, not least because the answer ought to frame the terms of the no campaign during the next two years. A lot will depend, as ever in democratic politics, on the actual referendum result. A defeat for independence on the scale implied in the polls at present would feel very different to a very narrow defeat, which Salmond would present as a mandate for devo max.</p> <p>Yet whatever the scale of&#xa0;a no victory, it would&#xa0;in fact do relatively little to settle most of the political and constitutional issues that are now increasingly corralled within the referendum campaign. Independence would certainly have been rejected, and would be off the table for at least a decade, perhaps a lot&#xa0;longer. But the SNP government would not disappear. Nor would the SNP. Indeed it could very easily be re-elected in 2016.</p> <p>And where would a no vote leave the United Kingdom? Constitutionally intact, maybe. But politically the UK could feel even less coherent than it does today. What would have been endorsed? The monarchy? The Cameron-Clegg coalition? The allure of the English? I don't think so.</p> <p>Where would it head, this endorsed UK? What stories would it tell itself, in its newly confirmed oneness? \"Better together,\" says the umbrella no campaign in Scotland. Fair enough. But voters need a truthful and sober account, in a world where economic power is shifting east and south and in which Europe faces decline not expansion, of what this means. And not just Scottish voters either. Welsh voters too, English and Irish. If Scotland votes no, that's not the end of the story. It could even be, though I say this more in hope than expectation, a new beginning.</p>",
  "<p>The news that the UK is doubling its drone deployment in Afghanistan (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/uk-double-drones-afghanistan\" title=\"\">New drones in Afghanistan to be controlled from Britain</a>, 23 October) raises some important questions that the British public needs to have answered. What rules of engagement currently govern the deployment of weaponised UK drones and who determines them? What influence will the US maintain over UK drone missions? Will UK deployment be confined to Afghan territory, or might cross-border strike missions be undertaken? If the MoD \"has no idea how many insurgents have died [in UK drone strikes] because of the 'immense difficulty and risks' of verifying who has been hit\", how can they state categorically that \"only four Afghan civilians have been killed\" since 2008?</p> <p>The announcement that the current five UK Reapers have already flown 39,628 hours and fired 334 Hellfire missiles in Afghanistan makes the escalation to 10 even more shocking. Parliament must assert a central role in publicly monitoring current and future deployment of UK drones to ensure there is no mission creep \u2013 President Obama's cavalier programme of distance slaughter cannot be replicated in UK conduct. If we kill as many innocent civilians as the CIA reportedly has, we shall surely reap what we sow.<br><strong>Robin Gill</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 This move reflects an incredibly disturbing trend in UK military policy. There has been no public debate or consultation about drone warfare, but the use of these unmanned killing machines has grown rapidly. While they purportedly allow for targeted, surgically precise strikes, recent reports have condemned the widespread killing of civilians \u2013 including hundreds of children \u2013 by drones. For the British public, it should also be disconcerting that RAF Waddington will be the new home for such remotely piloted violence. The distance afforded by unmanned aerial vehicles separates the military personnel guiding them from the arena of conflict in ways which we are only beginning to understand. Through such distorted interactions, a cheapening of the human impact of these vehicles \u2013 and the resultant civilian casualties \u2013 is inevitable. This decision represents a complete disregard for international law and innocent lives.<br><strong>Kate Hudson</strong><br><em>General secretary, CND</em></p> <p>\u2022 With regard to the moral aspect of the use of such weapons, I am reminded of the response of Bill Westwood, the late bishop of Peterborough, to the use of the atomic bomb on Japan in 1945. As a young paratrooper stationed in Sri Lanka awaiting deployment in the proposed invasion of Japan, he noted that the loss of life was going to be horrendous, given the Japanese renown for not surrendering. When asked later what he thought at the time, he said that while he didn't know what the atomic bomb was, he was relieved that he would not now be invading Japan. While the use of these drones is subject to debate, perhaps what little can be taken by the use of this weapon is that fewer UK troops engaged in fighting in Afghanistan will die while we remain in theatre.<br><strong>Robert Thomas</strong><br><em>Botcheston, Leicestershire </em></p> <p>\u2022 It is vital the suggestion that British support for US drone strikes \"may be a war crime\" is raised urgently (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/uk-support-us-drones-pakistan-war-crime\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 24 October). The increasing use of drones, not only by the US, but Israel, France and now the UK, raises questions of legitimacy not covered adequately by the present Geneva convention. Two weeks ago, Medact (a charity concerned about the impact of war on people's health) launched a report, <a href=\"http://www.medact.org/article_health.php?articleID=990\" title=\"\">Drones \u2013 The Physical and Psychological Implications of a Global Theatre of War</a>. It examines the devastating impact of drone warfare on the health of those in areas where they are deployed. Drone warfare has the attraction for the belligerent nation of providing the means to conduct war at arm's length and thus avoid endangering its own soldiers. Many other countries are also now researching drone warfare, and a rapid proliferation of their use will have far wider implications than even nuclear proliferation itself.</p> <p>It is vital our government develops policies to cover this new type of warfare in accordance with Geneva convention guidelines before it becomes another scourge of humanity, profiting only the powerful armaments manufacturers.<br><strong>John Green</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 We need to add the US base at NSA Menwith Hill to the list of concerns. There are GCHQ personnel at NSA Menwith Hill and this base plays a crucial role in \"intelligence-led warfare\". You don't have to be too smart to make the connections. Recently, Fabian Hamilton MP asked the defence secretary whether RAF Menwith Hill played a role in the planning and deployment of drones in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. The answer? \"For operational and security reasons we do not comment on the specific activities carried out at RAF Menwith Hill.\" It is wrong that the UK government hides behind this \"operational and security\" blanket. The bottom line is whether what the UK government is complicit with at either NSA Menwith Hill or RAF Waddington is legal and accountable. <br><strong>Lindis Percy</strong><br><em>Joint co-ordinator, Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases</em></p> <p>\u2022 According to your report, between 2,562 and 3,325 people have been killed in Pakistan from coalition drone attacks between June 2004 and mid-September 2012 \u2013 of whom between 474 and 881 were civilians, including 176 children. The UK is spending \u00a34bn of taxpayers' money on developing more of these drones, which I cannot recall being debated by and agreed on by parliament. These weapons are breaking international and humanitarian laws and fostering a video game mentality in warfare. Future wars will be fought not by people in the frontline but by remote-controlled killing machines. This type of warfare increases the sanitisation of conflict in which aggressors avoid taking moral responsibility for their actions.<br><strong>David Penney</strong><br><em>Colne, Lancashire</em></p>",
  "<p>The largest joint-enterprise murder prosecution in the country has ended with the conviction of the last of a group of 20 teenagers in connection with the killing of a 15-year-old boy at a busy central London railway station.</p> <p>Junior Bayode, now 19, was found guilty at the central criminal court of the manslaughter of Sofyen Belamouadden and of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. The victim, who was studying for GCSEs, was hunted down and set upon with knives and metal bars in front of hundreds of commuters at Victoria station in a murder captured on CCTV.</p> <p>Bayode was a 16-year-old student when he joined a 20-strong charge against Sofyen on 25 March 2010.</p> <p>The group pursued Sofyen into the station, down the escalator and into the ticket hall, where a smaller group hacked, kicked and battered him to death in front of scores of commuters.</p> <p>Bayode, who was convicted on Wednesday after a jury deliberated for 17 hours, had denied his role in the killing, claiming that he had tried to prevent his friends getting out of control.</p> <p>Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC described in court the extraordinary onslaught that took place in full public gaze.</p> <p>\"So brazen and confident were his killers \u2026 they openly carried the various weapons they used,\" he said. \"Such was their arrogance that they carried out that kind of attack in the heart of the capital city and a public place, the terminus of the station at the height of rush hour and in the sight of scores, if not hundreds of people passing by, going to their own homes.</p> <p>\"That confidence and arrogance came too from knowing that between them they were so heavily armed that no other individual or smaller group or even a police officer or member of station staff could stop them.\"</p> <p>The verdict brings to an end \u2013 with mixed results \u2013 the biggest joint-enterprise murder prosecution ever brought to court in England and Wales.</p> <p>All 20 teenagers arrested in the aftermath of the killing were charged with murder on the basis of joint enterprise including those not present at the moment the victim was killed.</p> <p>The prosecution, which stretched over nearly two years and involved five criminal trials, has resulted in juries convicting fewer than half of the 20 originally charged with murder over the killing of Sofyen.</p> <p>Juries rejected the crown case that all the teenagers were equally culpable because they planned the killing on social media the night before, arrived at Victoria station together, and chased their victim as a group \u2013 some of whom were armed \u2013 before a smaller handful of them surrounded him and killed Sofyen in the ticket hall. The trial judge also intervened at one case to clear five defendants of murder because they were not in the group around Sofyen when he was killed.</p> <p>In the end three teenagers were convicted of murder, five, including Bayode, of manslaughter, two of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, and seven of violent disorder. Three teenagers were acquitted of all charges.</p> <p>All but two of the teenagers responsible for the killing attended St Charles Catholic sixth form in west London, where they were studying for their A-levels.</p> <p>They planned the attack on social media the night before, the court was told, sending messages to each other on Facebook and via BlackBerry Messenger.</p> <p>The messages \u2013 which were retrieved by the police \u2013 revealed they were trying to source weapons including a samurai sword, flick knives, batons, metal bars and a set of kitchen knives, which were bought for \u00a33.99 from the catalogue shop Argos by one of the accused in the school lunchbreak on the day of the murder, the court has told.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the jury could not decide on a murder verdict against Bayode after 17 hours of deliberation and he may now face a retrial on that charge.</p>",
  "<p>We've reached a moment in American history where debates can be judged by who buys the most clever keyword on Twitter and how quickly (and how many) Tumblrs are launched while they are still happening. As the series of debates this month ended, I felt a pang of guilt and jealousy for every journo-tweet that scrolled across my screen with the simple message: \"Read my take here.\" We're doing \"takes\" now \u2013 though I think of them not as quick sketches of opinion, but in the movie-production sense: a series of line-readings varied in intonation but not content.</p> <p>It would be heresy to say anything besides what's already been decided (by whom? I can't always tell), and the tide of identical opinion overwhelms subtle distinctions about individual arguments. So, when it comes to the presidential contests: Obama lost the first debate; Romney lost the second debate; foreign policy lost the third. </p> <p>The insistence on declaring a \"winner\" in presidential debates has always irritated me. In arguments over philosophy, ideology or morality, what counts as \"winning\"? Back in high school forensics, we walked into speech-and-debate tournaments ready to argue either side, fully aware that the judges evaluated logical consistency, command of the material, originality of arguments, and presentation \u2013 not who was <em>right</em>. To \"win on points\" was a meaningful phrase, because someone was keeping score.</p> <p>Today's presidential debates don't even have a consistent standard for accuracy, and \"winning on points\" just means you came out ahead in a very high-level battle of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens\">the dozens</a>. Very well, never mind: it's exactly like high school except then we trusted the judges, because \"zingers\" and moments of special fluency, and not truth, are what seems to sway voters. Voters are not, for instance, undecided on the question of whether across-the-board tax cuts are a good idea. (In fact, they seem set against them <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/poll-don-t-extend-bush-cuts-for-wealthy-20120618?mrefid=mostViewed\">when you ask directly</a>.)</p> <p>Voters take in a discussion of tax rates as a form of instructional moral theater, a passion play in which the roles of good and evil haven't been definitively cast but will be determined by who makes the argument that <em>sounds</em> the most righteous. How else do you explain the consistent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253665216922005506\">approval</a> of Romney's tax spiel among undecided voters? The Twitter feed of the professors who supervised CNN's \"dial test\" shows, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253662826395209728\">again</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErinBurnett/status/258378909014425600\">again</a>, undecided voters reacting positively to policies that are demonstrably unpopular with most Americans, including independents, by <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57416095/cbs-news-nyt-poll-4-18-12/%20?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">margins of 20-30%</a>. (Only 36% all voters say the best way to promote economic growth is \"lower taxes and cut spending\"; 34% of independents say the same.)</p> <p>Judging the debates on salesmanship makes it easier to see past complaints from Democrats that the Romney who showed up for the debates was a different one than we saw on the stump: you can't really say Romney misrepresented <em>himself</em>, just his policies. Indeed, we saw both candidates' true nature, if not always the truth, throughout the series. </p> <p>They are both thin-skinned nerds, whose confidence about their command of facts is more certain than the facts themselves. Obama's sleepy nonchalance in the first debate and narrow-eyed near-sadism in the second spoke, in their way, to his arrogance; whereas Romney's casual, inappropriate references to all things he wants to subdue as things he \"likes\" (Big Bird, teachers, green energy) did the same.</p> <p>Romney showed himself to be awkwardly distant from the norms of American life (what struggling family doesn't look forward to tax-free capital gains!?) and speech (binders!). Obama demonstrated a Gen-X sense of humor, bordering on contemptuous (\"the 80s called\"). Romney's persnickety fixation with the debates' guidelines underscored a preoccupation with compliance that I felt belied the Obama camp's worst insinuations about him: whatever his tax returns or time at Bain might reveal, the guy is not a rule-breaker, much less a felon.</p> <p>Romney is as obsessed with following the letter of the law as Obama is with fudging literal fulfillment of regulations he believes objectionable \u2013 or, at least, politically inconvenient. However well-intentioned he might be, this is an apt description of the administration's position on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/politics/immigration-administration-reaction/index.html\">immigration law</a> and the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obamas-legal-progression-on-defense-of-marriage-act/\">Defense of Marriage Act</a>: intentional avoidance of enforcement. This casual attitude toward regulations one doesn't care for makes Obama more like George Bush than many Democrats would like to admit (see also: drone strikes, kill lists).</p> <p>Such self-assured capriciousness when it comes to governance is not a moral position I'm particularly comfortable with \u2013 and I'm not sure it's superior to Romney's programmatic intellectual alchemy (\"You say I'm inconsistent? Here is why I'm not! See? I fixed it!\"). Even more to the point, Romney abides by the rules \u2013 but wants to rewrite them so that they benefit him and people like him. And he sees nothing wrong with that.</p> <p>Yet, for a long time, I've thought that Romney's ingrained devotion to rules would make him a relatively unobjectionable president. As my dad put it once:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At least he won't get us into illegal wars.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But, of course, the debates showed that Romney's most unwavering trait is changeability. He might not get us into any \"illegal wars\" \u2013 but only because <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/08/02/627031/dan-senor-romney-closest-adviser/?mobile=nc\">Dan Senor</a> will convince him that there's a law they're following somewhere. Romney is somehow more adaptive to his environment than even our first biracial president.</p> <p>And in that way, he's following a path to victory much like the one we followed as high school rhetoricians: say anything.</p>",
  "<p>A potentially damaging split at the top of the Conservative party has been laid bare after the attorney general issued a warning saying Britain's role as an international advocate for human rights would be jeopardised if David Cameron defied a European court ordering a right to vote for some prisoners.</p> <p>The attorney general, Dominic Grieve, said Britain would be throwing away one of its great prizes as a soft diplomatic power \u2013 including its ability to persuade authoritarian states not to beat up its citizens in police cells \u2013 if it were seen to defy the European court of human rights.</p> <p>He did so as Cameron, at prime minister's questions in the house, insisted his government would never give the prisoners the vote, and suggested his government might table a motion to the Commons ruling out compliance.</p> <p>The government has until 22 November to respond to the European court ruling. Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, is the lead cabinet figure.</p> <p>Downing Street officials claimed that a fresh government vote, setting out reasons why the ruling was being defied, might satisfy the European court.</p> <p>It was claimed that Grieve might agree with this view, but his appearance at a justice select committee hearing on Wednesday gave no such hint.</p> <p>The fear for Cameron is of some senior government members resigning if he openly defies the court. Government officials, desperate to keep a lid on the row, said no option, including a draft bill, had been ruled out.</p> <p>Some parts of the government are arguing that relatively small changes could be made to the Representation of the People Act to comply with the ruling, and believe that they have cabinet support for a draft bill that would allow parliament to come to a considered view.</p> <p>Grieve, giving evidence to the justice select committee, defiantly refused to back down in his belief that the government should comply with a ruling which he said gave ministers flexibility as to how it was implemented.</p> <p>He said: \"The blanket ban is in breach of the convention (European convention on human rights). The UK government is an adherent to the convention and the convention is one of the international legal obligations. Successive governments, including this one, has always put a great emphasis on our adherence to international legal obligations.</p> <p>\"We live in a world where international law matters increasingly and the UK has always been a role model in areas of international law.\"</p> <p>He then raised the stakes by claiming that defiance would damage the government's international standing.</p> <p>He said: \"The UK has an enviable reputation in relation to human rights standards and adherence.\"</p> <p>He added that while attorney general he had \"done a good deal of travel outside of Europe, most of it connected with rule of law agenda, trying to persuade countries that have poor human rights to put in place structures so that human rights are respected, that police don't beat people up in prison cells and that standards are raised.</p> <p>\"We are the forefront of this. If was I trying to identify an area of benevolent soft power the UK has to offer, it is one of our great prizes. Inevitably, if we were to be in default of judgment of the European court of Human rights it would be seen by other countries as a move away from human rights norms.\"</p> <p>He said parliament was sovereign and free to respond as it wished to the court ruling, but added \"the accepted practice is that the UK observes its international obligations and that is something that is set out in a number of places including the ministerial code\".</p> <p>If Britain was in breach of the court, it would be open to prisoners to sue the UK government for compensation, and for the Council of Europe to expel the UK.</p> <p>He suggested the court had given the UK great flexibility as to how it implemented its ruling and that it might be possible to give the vote only to prisoners who went on \"a civil responsibility course\", or were released on licence.</p> <p>He added that it might be possible to deprive the vote from some individuals handed non-custodial sentences for breaches of electoral law. He also accepted some prisoners, such as fine defaulters, already had the vote.</p> <p>\"I'm simply stressing that there are numerous ways a government or parliament could approach the issue of change to the blanket ban,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>When Nicolas Sarkozy wore aviator shades and NYPD T-shirts, Rachida Dati posed in Dior on the cover of Paris Match and the former health minister Roselyne Bachelot appeared in pink Crocs at the Elys\u00e9e to honour a bet, it was clear that the French political class would never set the nation's fashion trends.

  "<p>Every campaign <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/oct/24/romney-obama-october-surprise-politics-live\">fights for control over media coverage</a>. But campaigns depend on the media to get their messages out. A quid pro quo develops. Campaigns trade access for coverage. What's strange is when a campaign asks for coverage but wants the access part to be invisible. Case in point: asking for a newspaper endorsement based on an off-the-record conversation.</p> <p>President Obama agreed to speak with the Des Moines Register this week about the election and why the paper should endorse him. But then the White House made the conversation off the record.</p> <p>The story might have ended there, with the Register editors deciding to endorse without ever releasing the nature of their conversation with the president.</p> <p>But Register editor Rick Green wrote a blog post Tuesday evening about the strange stipulation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president's vision for a second term. He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection. [...]</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we discussed was off-the-record. It was a condition, we were told, set by the White House.</p> </blockquote> <p>Green's post caught the attention of Register readers and other media outlets. Speculation cropped up that the president had said something the White House did not want to be released. Questions about the off-the-record condition threatened to eclipse whatever impact an endorsement might have. There was the uncomfortable fact that Governor Romney had conducted an extensive, hour-long interview with the paper that he allowed to be filmed.</p> <p>The White House then suddenly reversed course, conceding to the newspaper's request to release details of the conversation. The paper published the transcript of the conversation online today.</p> <p>The bombshell in the transcript? No bombshell. Obama said a couple things slightly differently than he has said them before. The Huffington Post highlighted this passage about the Latino vote:</p> <blockquote> <p>Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,\" Obama said on a call Tuesday with the Register's publisher and editor, which was originally meant to be off the record. \"Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Register will make its endorsement Saturday night.</p> <p>In 2008 the Register endorsed Obama, writing, \"Obama has earned the Register's endorsement for the presidency because of his steadfastness in the face of uncertainty, his clear-eyed vision for a more just America and his potential for rallying the country to do great things.\"</p>",
  "<p>Leonid Razvozzhayev spoke quickly from the bed of his one-man jail cell. \"I'm scared to stay here alone,\" he told the group of prison rights activists who had come to visit him. \"I'm afraid those men \u2013 the ones who took me me, who tortured me \u2013 will come back.\"</p> <p>Razvozzhayev, a 39-year-old anti-Putin activist and aide to an opposition MP, flew to Ukraine last week amid a spiralling crackdown on Russia's opposition. Just a day after he arrived, Russian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into him, the first step to bringing charges for allegedly organising mass unrest and a potential 10-year jail sentence. Thus Razvozzhayev began the long process of bidding for political asylum \u2013 and in the midst of it disappeared, only to turn up at a Moscow prison two days later.</p> <p>Razvozzhayev's story \u2013 one of alleged abduction, torture, death threats and forced confessions \u2013 has sent a bolt of fear and anger through those opposed to Russia's powerful president. It is the latest, and perhaps most convoluted, tale to emerge from the Kremlin's attempt to put down the opposition that emerged to challenge Putin's return to power earlier this year.</p> <p>\"He's not sure what day it is \u2013 he's in such a state, under such pressure,\" said Zoya Svetova, one of the five activists who visited Razvozzhayev on Tuesday. Svetova is a journalist for the New Times, an opposition magazine, in which she described her conversation with Razvozzhayev.</p> <p>Razvozzhayev told the group how he had left Russia for neighbouring Ukraine on 15 October. The next day, prosecutors in Moscow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/russia-opposition-leader-detained-udaltsov\" title=\"\">opened a criminal investigation into him and two fellow activists</a> in the socialist Left Front \u2013 its leader, Sergei Udaltsov, and Konstantin Lebedev. They were suspected of plotting mass unrest and terrorist attacks in Russia, investigators said, citing a propaganda report on state-run television that claimed to show the men plotting revolution.</p> <p>Fearing the worst if he were to return to Russia, Razvozzhayev, an aide to outspoken parliamentary deputy Ilya Ponomaryov, decided to seek political asylum and approached the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) on 19 October. They directed him to a partner organisation for legal counselling. The talks were long. He went out for a sandwich \u2013 and never came back.</p> <p>Razvozzhayev said four men were waiting for him at the exit. \"They threw me in a minivan,\" the New Times quoted him as saying. \"They put a tight black hat on me, so I couldn't see anything, and tied my arms and legs up with tape. And we were off.\" UNHCR issued a statement saying it was \"deeply concerned\" about his disappearance.</p> <p>They drove for hours in near total silence, Razvozzhayev said. At what he believes was the Russia-Ukraine border, he was put into another minivan and driven further. Once they stopped, he was handcuffed and dragged into a cellar and interrogated for two days, he said, alleging psychological torture.</p> <p>\"For two days they didn't let me go to the toilet. I didn't eat, I didn't drink the whole time,\" Razvozzhayev told the prison rights activists. The handcuffs never came off, he added. The unidentified men pressured him into signing a confession and implicating his fellow activists, Razvozzhayev alleged.</p> <p>\"They told me: if you don't answer our questions, then your children will be killed,\" he told the group. \"I agreed to say what they wanted.\" He was then taken to the headquarters of the investigative committee in Moscow, a body akin to the FBI.</p> <p>Video obtained by Life News, a tabloid, and aired on its website on Sunday evening showed Razvozzhayev being transferred from the building to a waiting police van, shouting \"Tell them I've been tortured\". On Monday, the committee issued a statement saying Razvozzhayev had wilfully turned himself in. Officials have denied all claims of torture.</p> <p>The investigative committee charged Razvozzhayev on Tuesday and remanded him in custody for two months. Udaltsov is due to be charged on Friday, it said. The men face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.</p> <p>\"The massive persecution of dissidents in Russia is continuing,\" the opposition said in a joint statement on Wednesday. \"\"The Russian authorities have turned to methods of direct pressure of force against its opponents.\" Activists held a day-long protest outside the headquarters of the federal security service, the main successor to the KGB, on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"One week ago, we didn't think that a person could be abducted and forced into a confession,\" Svetova told the Guardian. \"We didn't think it was possible to open a criminal case because of a TV programme. This didn't even exist in the Soviet Union. Who knows what's next.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Russian parliament passed the latest in a string of laws that activists warn are designed to crack down on the opposition. The law, which must be signed by Putin before coming into force, expands the definition of high treason to include vague wording that could be used against any Russian who speaks to a foreigner, activists warned.</p>",
  "<p>Women's sport is sidelined, underfunded and ignored, according to a broad coalition of MPs, peers, sportswomen and broadcasters who have warned that the legacy of a historic summer for women's sport is in danger of being squandered.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://wsff.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF)</a> called coverage of women's sport \u2013 only 5% of media coverage \u2013 shocking and said the government must do more to promote women's sport.</p> <p>Research from the charity revealed that women's sport receives just 0.5% of all commercial sponsorship, while only one in five board members of national governing bodies are women.</p> <p>\"It has been the most amazing summer for women's sport, and we must not now let the moment pass,\" said Sue Tibballs, CEO of WSFF. \"More coverage is not going to just happen on its own \u2013 we need action from the government, media and commercial partners to make this happen.\"</p> <p>The charity was joined at a meeting in the House of Lords by Olympic gold medallist rower Katherine Grainger, journalist Clare Balding, Harriet Harman, shadow secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Lady Grey-Thompson and Barbara Keeley MP. They called for more media coverage, more programmes aimed at girls in school, more female leadership in sports organisations and more opportunities for women and girls to get involved in sport. \"Only 12% of girls at the age of 14 are taking part in the recommended amount of activity \u2013 and that has very serious ramifications beyond sport,\" said Tibballs. \"This summer, we saw female athletes who were strong, powerful and inspiring. Let's see them celebrated as athletes, rather than dressing them up in evening gowns.\"</p> <p>Three-quarters of people surveyed by the charity wanted to see more media coverage of women's sport, while 81% thought female athletes at London 2012 provided better role models for young girls than other celebrities.</p> <p>Grainger said she had not become a sportswoman to be a role model, but took her role seriously. \"It was an amazing summer for women's sport, everywhere I've gone since then everyone is still buzzing with excitement and sense that everything is possible,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The stage was utterly set for the girl power Olympics.\" Women had won medals \"because they were capable, inspired and because they were good enough,\" she said.</p> <p>Balding, who became a favourite with viewers during the Olympics and Paralympics, called on broadcasters to show more women's sport. \"What about if editors in newspapers and radio shows dedicated just one item a day to women's sport?\" she asked.</p> <p>She called for the media to be \"honest\" about the sport they covered: \"it is not the sport, it is the men's sport,\" she said. Broadcasters and newspapers were missing a opportunity to meet a desire for more coverage of women's sport. \"This is the moment for a broadcaster to stand up and say we believe in this we're going to support this,\" she said.</p> <p>Harman joined with WSFF in calling for an inquiry into media coverage of women's sport by the culture, media and sport select committee. She called for women in sport to be \"strident, stroppy\" and not to accept the status quo.</p> <p>She also called for more aggressive use of the Equality Act, saying it should not be legal for men to be paid more prize money in sporting competitions, for women to be excluded from sporting clubs or for mens teams to travel in business class, while women were in economy.</p> <p>\"If these things are not against the law we need amendments to the Equality Act\", she said, adding that if they were against the law \"we need to sue the backsides off people\".</p>",
  "<p>There is little surprise that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/15/conrad-black-appear-bbc1-hignfy\" title=\"\">Conrad Black returned to London</a> this week to pursue his resurrection. Black passionately wants to get back to business and restore his social status. Sentenced in Chicago in 2007 to six-and-a-half years imprisonment for fraud and obstruction of justice, Black earned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/21/conrad-black-released-on-bail\" title=\"\">early remission from a Florida jail</a> for good conduct and returned at the beginning of this year to his only remaining home in Toronto \u2013 he previously had four. Now he yearns to resume his life in London \u2013 not least because Canadians have shown loathing for the man who churlishly gave up his Canadian citizenship to accept a British peerage, and most are outraged that a British crook should be allowed to resume life in his Toronto mansion.</p> <p>Now it is up to the British to decide whether they will accept Black's return to the London stage.</p> <p>During his tour of London's television studios \u2013 most notably in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/conrad-black-adam-boulton\" title=\"\">confrontations with Jeremy Paxman and Adam Boulton</a> \u2013 Black spewed out a long-rehearsed monologue to dazzle his countrymen with professions of victimhood and demands for resurrection as a social giant fit to vote in the House of Lords and take tea in Buckingham Palace. In his carefully contrived redemptive plea, he spawns a tale of being the innocent victim of the US justice system.</p> <p>Understandably, his carpet-bombing of TV interviewers with obscure arguments confounds the public who are ignorant about the intricacies of his trial and his subsequent appeals. The facts, however, are incontestable. Black's frauds were discovered by the shareholders of Hollinger, the owner of the Telegraph group. \"You're a thief,\" one shareholder yelled during the company's annual meeting in 2001. Eventually, all his fellow directors realised that Black had lied to them about Hollinger's accounts and he had taken about $200m from the company. The US government prosecuted on 14 charges.</p> <p>The trial was staggeringly fair. Hugely damning evidence against Black was excluded by the judge. Most remarkably, having endlessly pontificated how he intended to destroy the prosecutors, Black did not testify in his own defence. Instead he propelled his hapless secretary to testify and she was slaughtered by prosecutors.</p> <p>The jury quickly found Black guilty of three counts of fraud and obstruction of justice, but then began five days of vituperative argument about whether Black's use of corporate money to pay for his honeymoon and a birthday party for his wife was criminal. On the remaining fraud and racketeering charges nine jurors believed he was crooked while three disagreed. The legacy of the blistering rows was their irreconcilable split \u2013 9 to 3. So Black was acquitted of 10 charges.</p> <p>But, as the trial judge and the subsequent appeal judges all said in open court, the evidence against Black was overwhelming. He was, the judges agreed, rightly found guilty by the jury of systematically looting Hollinger. So on appeal in Chicago his convictions were upheld.</p> <p>However, with great skill, Black appealed to the supreme court. In a complicated legal argument, he persuaded the judges to change one law about the \"honest services\" owed by a company director to his shareholders. Technically, two of the fraud convictions became \"unsafe\". But the judges stated that, as Black was so patently guilty of fraud, he should return to prison even on one count of fraud for $600,000 and obstruction of justice. The judges agreed with the jury, with Hollinger's shareholders and directors, that Black was guilty of systematic fraud.</p> <p>Disregarding the judges' universal condemnation, Black has arrived in London to assert his innocence. He states that since only two convictions out of 14 charges were upheld, he is really innocent. Spectators of Black's behaviour should not be surprised.</p> <p>Convicted fraudsters who want to stay in business obey a single rule for their future prosperity \u2013 they always protest their innocence and seek pity as the victims of vengeful prosecutors, governments or \"dark forces\". The fraudster knows that the slightest admission of guilt would permanently destroy his ambition to restore his social reputation and get back into making money. His mission of reassertion is always accompanied by cursing and trivialising an unfortunate interruption in his blessed way of life \u2013 like a damning government report, bankruptcy, or a period in jail.</p> <p>The eventual outcome of Black's mission to rise from the dead like Lazarus cannot be predicted. He follows in the footsteps of the most masterful practioner of resurrection \u2013 Robert Maxwell. The Bouncing Czech overcame universal damnation in 1971 for his dishonesty, and by 1985 was back at the hub of British politics and business.</p> <p>Throughout his life, Black has fought his critics. First, when he stole and sold exam papers at school. Then when he bought Argus, Canada's biggest conglomerate, and was accused of mismanaging the pension fund. And more recently for his conduct during a takeover bid for an American mining company that a US judge declared to be dishonest.</p> <p>After each case, Black cursed his critics as malicious and defended himself as a pillar of probity. His visit to London is just the latest in the familiar Black roadshow: \"Trust Honest Conrad \u2013 the scion of respectability\". The fireworks and his Wagnerian damnation of his critics is a familiar accompaniment to a tested performance.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond's chaotic attempts to persuade voters he could take an independent Scotland smoothly into the European Union have suffered another setback, after Spain said Scotland would need to \"join the queue\" and negotiate as a new member state.</p> <p>Foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo told the Spanish senate on Tuesday that an independent Scotland would have to go through a potentially long negotiating process and win the support of all 27 members, including Spain \u2013 directly contradicting Salmond's position on EU membership.</p> <p>\"In the hypothetical case of independence, Scotland would have to join the queue and ask to be admitted, needing the unanimous approval of all member states to obtain the status of a candidate country \u2026 and to sign the final treaty [of accession],\" Garc\u00eda-Margallo said.</p> <p>Intensifying the pressure on Salmond, the Spanish foreign minister said Scotland would also need member states to scrutinise its legislation before approving the 35 separate chapters that have to be negotiated before a new member is admitted.</p> <p>In September, the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, also suggested that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership\" title=\"\">an independent Scotland would be seen as a new state</a>, and would need to apply to join.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda-Margallo did not say whether Spain might block Scottish EU membership, but his rightwing People's party government is currently fighting a battle to prevent Catalonia, a wealthy region with significant levels of autonomy, from calling its own independence referendum. Last weekend, Basque nationalist and separatist parties won two-thirds of the seats in its regional assembly, intensifying pressure on Madrid to cede more powers. It now appears the Spanish government's dispute with its own independence movements has led to a hardening stance on Scotland.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda-Margallo's intervention is another significant setback to Salmond, who has endured bruising allegations from opponents and the Scottish press over whether he had lied about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland\" title=\"\">receiving formal legal advice from government law officers on EU membership</a>.</p> <p>Until now, Salmond and his ministers have regarded Garc\u00eda-Margallo as a significant ally in their efforts to show that an independent Scotland would be able to freely and smoothly inherit EU membership. They have frequently cited his remarks in January this year, when Garc\u00eda-Margallo indicated Spain was neutral about Scotland's future membership.</p> <p>At the time, Garc\u00eda-Margallo said it was \"an internal subject which will be resolved within the British constitutional framework, which has nothing to do with the Spanish constitutional framework \u2026 they are completely different processes\".</p> <p>Salmond's difficulties escalated dramatically on Tuesday when it emerged his government had never asked for or received any advice from its law officers on whether an independent Scotland would automatically join the EU, after months of hints and apparent confirmation that such advice had been given.</p> <p>His deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, shocked opposition parties by disclosing the advice had only just been requested, after the Edinburgh agreement setting up the independence referendum was signed by Salmond and David Cameron last week.</p> <p>The Scottish government has also gone to Scotland's highest civil court seeking to overturn an order from the Scottish information commissioner, Rosemary Agnew, that it should disclose that advice. That legal challenge \u2013 due to be heard in December \u2013 has now been dropped.</p> <p>Salmond angrily denied on Tuesday that he had lied in an interview with Andrew Neil on BBC1 earlier this year, when he appeared to confirm his law officers had supported his case that an independent Scotland would join the EU automatically, would not need to join the euro and would inherit the UK's opt-outs on border security, immigration and financial treaty requirements. Salmond insisted he had been speaking in general terms in his BBC&#xa0;interview.</p> <p>After headlines and leader columns accused Salmond bluntly of \"lying\", the pressure intensified on Wednesday when the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, asked for Scotland's chief law officer \u2013 the lord advocate, Frank Mulholland \u2013 to appear before the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>During prime minister's questions in the Commons on Wednesday, Cameron said the situation was \"truly baffling\" and raised substantial questions about Salmond's assurances on the impact of independence.</p> <p>\"It turns out now they didn't have any legal advice at all and I think what this shows is when you shine the spotlight on the case for separation the SNP put, it completely falls apart,\" Cameron said.</p> <p>A Scottish government spokeswoman said Garc\u00eda-Margallo's latest remarks had been \"overtaken by events\" because there was now a deal between the governments to set up the independence referendum. That document, however, makes no mention of EU membership. \"As Mr Garc\u00eda-Margallo himself said earlier this year, this is an internal matter to be resolved within the UK \u2013 and we now have that clear agreement on the process,\" she said.</p> <p>She implied the Spanish foreign minister's latest remarks were wrong: \"Scotland will inherit exactly the same international treaty rights and obligations as the rest of the UK, as equal successor states.</p> <p>\"Scotland has been an integral part of the European Union for almost four decades, so an independent Scotland will continue in EU membership \u2013 and by definition Scotland already meets the criteria for EU membership, as acknowledged recently by an expert report.\"</p>",
  "<p>Libyan government forces captured the town of Bani Walid on Wednesday, ending an eight-day battle that has cost at least 20 lives and left more than 200 wounded.</p> <p>The desert town, described by the government as Libya's last stronghold loyal to Muammar Gaddafi, has defied official control since January.</p> <p>Government spokesman Nasser al-Mana'a said the offensive followed a string of kidnappings by gangs in the town and the murder of a former militiaman credited with capturing Gaddafi last year.</p> <p>\"Bani Walid had become a centre for fugitives from justice, kidnappers \u2013 we can say they kidnapped the city,\" he said.</p> <p>Television pictures showed army units backed by pickup trucks carrying anti-aircraft guns being deployed in a town square in the centre. A uniformed pro-government militia commander, Feras Sewehli, said: \"Bani Walid is under government control.\"</p> <p>The president of Libya's parliament, Mohamed el-Magariaf, said human rights were being respected by army forces, after the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon called for all sides to show restraint. \"Military operations in Bani Walid do not target the city and its people,\" Magariaf said.</p> <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that 25,000 of the town's estimated 80,000 population have fled to refugee camps outside town because of the fighting, the worst Libya has seen since the end of October 2011.</p> <p>At the weekend, supporters of the rebels in Bani Walid mobs tried to storm the national parliament in Tripoli and wrecked a pro-government television station in Benghazi.</p> <p>Unverified reports from inside the town said there had been massacres, indiscriminate shelling and a poison gas attack but no evidence has yet emerged.</p> <p>Bani Walid's television station remained on air throughout the day, labelling army forces as \"gangsters\" and showing footage of two children, one dead from a head wound and the other missing a foot.</p> <p>\"We went in this morning and captured the town, now all is under control,\" said pro-government fighter Muhsen al-Gubbi. \"We are being careful not to target civilians and not use rockets in civilian areas.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month, the government ordered the army to use \"all necessary means\" to free the kidnapped and arrest criminals and Gaddafi-era officials.</p> <p>Army leaders will be pleased with the control of units built around last year's rebel militias.</p> <p>The offensive saw Misratan units outflank the main defensive positions of Bani Walid. But the reality is Libya remains deeply divided along tribal lines, with Bani Walid and other former pro-Gaddafi towns resisting the new order.</p>",
  "<p>Kasha Nelson, 31, was only supposed to go hiking with a friend. But in the 45 minutes it took to drive from Taos to Ski Valley in northern New Mexico she'd changed her vote. For the last three elections she's voted Democrat, but this time she was leaning towards Romney. \"In 2008 I got caught up in the whole hope and change thing, but I've lost total confidence in Obama's ability to get us out of this mess and I thought, with his business background, Romney might be a different breed of politician.\"</p> <p>She shared her intentions with her friend, a woman in her 20s and in a long-term relationship, who promptly reminded Kasha that she had just had an abortion. Romney's election, and the supreme court nominations that come with it, her friend argued, could take away that choice and criminalise that action. Is that what Kasha wanted? Kasha, who was raised \"very\" Catholic in a trailer in southern Alabama, believes abortion is a necessary evil. She finds the Republicans' social conservatism a \"real turn-off\" but \"has a lot of faith in the independence of the supreme court\".</p> <p>Until then, Kasha had become weary of the way all conversations about the election with her friends would start with discussions about making ends meet and then switch to abortion, contraception and gay marriage as soon as she mentioned she might vote for Romney.</p> <p>She was beginning to feel like her life was stalling and was looking for a leader who could revitalise the economy. Once a bilingual teacher, she took a career break to do a creative writing course in Santa Fe, and was now struggling to get back into the job market. After we finished breakfast she was driving five hours to Denver to take up an office job paying $6,000 less than the teaching job she'd left a few years ago.</p> <p>But when confronted with the direct experience of her friend and the direct consequence of her vote, she felt compelled to reconsider. \"I went back and looked up where Romney stood on the issues on his website and I just decided I couldn't vote for that. My vote couldn't just be about money and jobs.\"</p> <p>There are (to adopt Romney's phrase) \"binders full of women\" who are turned off by the Republicans' policies on reproductive rights. But those binders become even thicker when marital status is taken into account. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/gop-convention-tampa/gop-convention-columnists/juan-williams/245509-opinion-why-the-republican-party-is-losing-the-battle-for-women-voters\">A summer poll</a> gave Obama a 46-point lead among single women like Kasha and her friend. And almost every year there are more of them. Thanks to feminism and the increased educational opportunities, equality laws and reproductive choices that have come with it, women are <a href=\"http://marriage.about.com/od/statistics/a/medianage.htm\">getting married</a> and <a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_surprising-facts-about-birth-in-the-united-states_1372273.bc\">having children</a> later in life. In 1970, unmarried women comprised 38% of the population; today they are 47%. Kasha's mother got married when she was 19 and had Kasha shortly afterwards. Kasha has other options. She'd like to keep them.</p> <p>It's just one of the examples of the many ways in which Americans live, love, move and behave that is having an impact on the nation's electoral landscape. The US is becoming less white, less religious, more urban and diverse in its living arrangements, and migrating to the south and west. Some of these changes, like the growing strength of the Latino vote or an ageing population heading for the sun belt, are demographic. Last year, for the first time ever, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/05/17/152896230/minorities-are-now-majority-of-u-s-births-census-says\">the majority of babies born in America were not white</a>, presaging a near future where white people will be a minority. Others, like the propensity of people to marry later and for women to remain single longer, are social. Some of these changes are happening very quickly: <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/NEWS/usaedition/2012-04-12-Cohabiting---with-kids---_ST_U.htm\">the proportion of children born out of wedlock</a> from 2006-2010 was double that born in 2002. Others take more time: during that same time span the median age at which American women married increased by less than a year. Many are not immediately obvious. The fastest growing \"religious group\" in the US is those with \"no religious affiliation\". In 1944 they were one in 20; in 2004 they were one in seven; by 2024 they are projected to be at least one in five. But all have political consequences. America is changing far faster and more thoroughly than its electoral rhetoric, strategies and alliances can keep up.</p> <p>\"The tectonic plates of American politics are shifting,\" <a href=\"http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/progressive-movement/report/2010/06/16/7953/demographic-change-and-the-future-of-the-parties/\">argues Ruy Teixeira in a 2010 paper</a> Democratic Change and the Future of the Parties for the liberal thinktank, the Center for American Progress. \"A powerful concatenation of demographic forces is transforming the American electorate and reshaping both major political parties. And, as demographic trends continue, this transformation and reshaping will deepen.\"</p> <h2>'Latinos became more moderate'</h2> <p>In few places is this clearer than <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/presidential-geography-new-mexico/\">New Mexico,</a> which has gone from the swingiest of states to being safely Democratic in just three election cycles. In 2000, the outcome in New Mexico was closer than Florida: Al Gore took it with a majority of just 366. In 2004 the Republicans won it back with a slightly healthier 5,988 lead. Then in 2008 there was a rout. Obama reclaimed it with a 15-point margin and a lead of 125,590. This year it is not even being contested. The last four polls there have Obama leading by double figures.</p> <p>The most obvious explanation for this would be the rising number of Latinos. Between 2000 and 2010 the state's Latino population grew 24.6%. Between 2000 and 2008 the number of registered Latino voters leaped by 44% and the number of actual Latino voters jumped by 51%. At just over a third New Mexico has the highest proportion of Latino voters of any state in the country.</p> <p>But that explanation, on its own, would be incomplete and incorrect. The number of Hispanics were growing in 2000 and 2004, yet the Republicans won the state back and increased their share of the Latino vote. The numbers continued growing and the state still elected a Republican governor (Susana Martinez, who is Latina) in 2010. So there is nothing inherent about a growing Latino population that makes a Democratic outcome inevitable. True, Latinos tend to be poorer and poor people tend to vote Democrat. <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2012/08/24/can-the-republicans-connect-with-latinos-on-abortion-2/\">But Latinos are also more likely to be religious</a> and against abortion than the nation at large too. Republicans have the only two Latino governors in the country \u2013 Martinez and Brian Sandoval in Nevada. After this election cycle they will have more Latino senators than Democrats. Of the five states with the highest proportion of Latinos two, California and New Mexico, are safely Democratic. Two, Arizona and Texas are, for now, safely Republican, and one, Nevada, is a swing state.</p> <p>So demography is not electoral destiny. People vote their interests not their identities and parties mould their platforms to appeal to people's interests. There is nothing inevitable about either. Women are evenly split on the issue of abortion; <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/research/2012/02/january-tracking-poll-2012/\">polls showed Catholics more likely</a> to demand employers provide healthcare plans that cover birth control at no cost than Protestants. Until the 1980 Republicans were more likely to be pro-choice than Democrats. The complicating factor is that quite often those interests are intertwined with their sense of identity. Wealthy African Americans overwhelmingly vote for Democrats not because they will be better off financially, but because they are turned off by the Republicans' racially charged rhetoric.</p> <p>\"A decade ago there would have been a large number of Latinos who saw themselves as conservative. But they became more moderate as the Republicans moved to the right,\" says Gabriel Sanchez, a professor at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The decline has been quite dramatic. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/NM/P/00/epolls.0.html\">In 2004 Bush got 44%</a> of the Latino vote; in 2008 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=NMP00p1\">McCain netted just 30%</a>; a poll released <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2012/10/17/new-poll-from-latino-decisions-indicates-that-immigration-matters-to-hispanic-voters-in-new-mexico/\">earlier this week by Latino Decisions</a> suggest just 24% will vote for Romney.</p> <p>The reason New Mexico has turned Democrat isn't just because it became more Latino but because Republicans simultaneously became perceived as more xenophobic. \"Republicans have really leveraged the anti-immigrant rhetoric to appeal to their white nativist base, and in the short term that might work nationally,\" explains Sanchez, who also acts as the director of research for the polling organisation Latino Decisions. \"But in the long term it will have negative effects. They are seen not as anti-immigrant but anti-Latino.\"</p> <h2>'This election is a critical juncture for the Republican party'</h2> <p>California is used as the cautionary tale. Between 1952 and 1988 it voted Republican every time bar one. In 1992 Clinton won it with 46% of the vote but it still had the potential to swing back. In 1994 came Proposition 187, a Republican-backed measure to bar undocumented migrants from healthcare, public education and other services in the state. They won the vote (though the law was found unconstitutional) and lost Latinos. Now, like New Mexico, it's safely Democratic. \"Research show that Latinos who came of voting age during that time are less likely to ever vote Republican again because that is when their image of Republicans was formed. Latinos are not in the bag for Republicans yet. But it could get that way if Republicans don't change.\" If it did, Texas and Arizona would, sooner or later, go the way of New Mexico and California.</p> <p>This is not just a problem locally, but with the entire Republican electoral strategy since the end of the civil rights era \u2013 the last time in fact that there was a seismic shift in the nation's electoral allegiances. Back then Republicans realised that if they could shed their reputation as the party of Lincoln they could peel off a whites in both the south and northern suburbs with a subtle appeal to racial animus. It worked. <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/\">In 1976, Jimmy Carter</a> won all the former confederate states bar Virginia. By 2000, Al Gore won none, even though he and his father had represented one of them (Tennessee) as senators.</p> <p>Richard Nixon explained the plan to his chief-of-staff, Bob Haldeman, who wrote it in his diary. \"You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,\" Nixon told him. \"The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to.\"</p> <p>When white people made up around 85% of the voters that made sense. But over the past three election cycles alone <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/2000.htm\">the white vote has dropped</a> from 80% in 2000 to 74% in 2008. With 50,000 new Latinos becoming eligible to vote every month, the long-term trend for that white share of the vote will be downward, which means the more black and Latino voters the Republicans alienate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/us-most-racially-polarised-election-white\">the more white voters they need to replace them</a>. \"The demographics race we're losing badly,\" said Republican, senator Lindsey Graham, acknowledging the problem. \"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>They are trying their best. Romney has a 20-point lead among whites \u2013 the biggest racial gap for almost 30 years. Meanwhile, Joe the Plumber, now a Republican congressional candidate in Ohio, has an original plan for immigration reform. \"Put a fence on the damn border and start shooting,\" he says.</p> <p>But sooner rather than later Republicans will either become more inclusive or less viable. \"This is the last time anyone will try to do this,\" one Republican strategist told the National Journal. And Republican consultant Ana Navarro told the Los Angeles Times: \"Where his [Romney's] numbers are right now, we should be pressing the panic button.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398299839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351096694145/abortion-protest-capitol-008.jpg\" alt=\"abortion protest capitol\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republicans' stance on reproductive rights, like their southern strategy on race, was engineered during the early 1970s with electoral advantage in mind. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For in an increasingly polarised electorate loyal constituencies make a big difference. In <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/swing-state-demographics-might-sway-2012-election-outcome-221800949.html\">swing states like Nevada, Florida, Virginia and North Carolina</a>, white people comprise less than two-thirds of the population. In Colorado, Latinos make up 20%. Even in states like Ohio, Wisconsin or Iowa, where Latinos make up between 3% and 5% of the population, they can make a difference in a close-run contest.</p> <p>\"This election is a critical juncture for the Republican party,\" says Christine Sierra, heads UNM's Southwest Hispanic Research Institute. \"Latinos would be a more diverse voting bloc if there were reasons to vote Republican. But without those reasons its possible they could become as cohesive a voting bloc as African Americans.\"</p> <p>Republicans' stance on reproductive rights, like their southern strategy on race, was engineered during the early 1970s with electoral advantage in mind. In 1969 George Bush Sr, then a Texas congressman, told the House: \"We need to make family planning a household word. We need to take the sensationalism out of the topic so it can no longer be used by militants \u2026 who are using it as a political stepping stone.\" That same year Nixon said: \"No American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.\" But a couple of years later, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_lepore\">as Jill Lepore points out in a New Yorker article</a>, Patrick Buchanan wrote a memo to Nixon advocating using the abortion issue to woo the Catholic vote. \"If the president should publicly take his stand against abortion as offensive to his own moral principles \u2026 then we can force [Ed] Muskie [a failed Democratic presidential candidate in 1972] to make the choice between his tens of millions of Catholic supporters and his liberal friends.\" The next week Nixon spoke of his \"personal belief in the sanctity of human life \u2013 including the life of the yet unborn\".</p> <p>This has served them better among evangelicals than Catholics, but it is causing considerable damage to their reputation among the growing number of educated women and unmarried couples.</p> <p>\"I just think Republicans want to take us backwards to another time,\" says Erica, 37, a school teacher who lives in Taos, New Mexico, where she raises her child alone. \"When they're talking about family values I don't think they're talking about a single mum who's juggling child care and work. I don't think they can related to a single woman in her thirties with some life experience. When you go to Planned Parenthood they don't offer you an abortion as soon as you walk through the door. They talk through your options.\"</p> <p>\"They just seem so tunnel-visioned,\" says Erica, who was raised evangelical in Minnesota. The episode when Rush Limbaugh referred to Georgetown student Sandra Fluke as a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" after Fluke spoke in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraception, she says, is a case in point. \"That suggests a larger attitude towards women. I don't know if Romney agrees but a large segment of his party does and he didn't come out and say that's crazy.\"</p> <p>Some progressives believe these trends spell the death knell for the Republican party in its present form. \"The Democratic party will become even more dominated by the emerging constituencies that gave Barack Obama his historic 2008 victory,\" argues Teixeira, author of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0305.teixeira.html\">The Emerging Democratic Majority</a>. \"While the Republican party will be forced to move toward the centre to compete for these constituencies. As a result, modern conservatism is likely to lose its dominant place in the GOP.\"</p> <p>That's too deterministic. For a start there are countervailing trends. The migration of Americans south and west over the years and <a href=\"http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2010/12/21/reapportionment-and-the-electoral-college/\">the reapportioning of electoral college seats</a> to accommodate those population movements has helped Republicans. If Obama won the same states this year as he did four years ago he would have six electoral college seats less because the population in the states he won has not risen as fast as in the states he lost. Demography alone over the last decade has handed Republicans the equivalent of Iowa.</p> <p>Moreover, most of the groups Republicans are losing are less motivated than those they have gained. Only 71% of Latinos, 76% of the unmarried and 78% of the non religious <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\">say they will definitely vote</a>. Conversely 86% of whites, 87% of Protestants and 88% of married people say they will. This is why there is such a discrepancy between how Obama fares with registered voters compared to likely voters and why the 'ground game' will in the coming weeks will be so crucial. For all the emphasis on women voters Obama is tied with women likely voters overall and trails white women by 9 points.</p> <p>For the Democrats to take advantage of these changes they have to give people something to vote for and then get them to vote. That's not necessarily as easy as it sounds.</p> <p>Still unable to bring herself to vote for Obama, Kasha cast her ballot early for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. \"I'm totally disgusted with the two-party system,\" she says. \"We don't have a good choice, and I don't want to want to compromise. I don't care if the guy I vote for doesn't get to win. I've had enough of just voting out of fear for the other side.\"</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister's announcement that \"prisoners are not getting the vote under this government\" is profoundly depressing.</p> <p>I say that not because I have a strong view on the policy itself. I would be perfectly content, for example, for judges to deprive prisoners of their voting rights in the same way they deprive prisoners of their liberty. I would be equally content with a law saying defendants sentenced to longer than a specified minimum period in prison should lose the vote automatically.</p> <p>I am not even suggesting that letting convicted prisoners vote would make very much difference, either to prisoners or to the elections in which they might vote. We don't know how many defendants awaiting trial bother to post a ballot paper from prison, as they are entitled to do. Voter apathy among prisoners might turn out be as high as it is among the population as a whole, although I suspect some prisoners would be more likely to vote than they were when at liberty.</p> <p>I am much more concerned about David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/prisoners-vote-david-cameron\" title=\"\">snub to his senior law officer</a>. Dominic Grieve has turned out to be an excellent attorney general, shrewd, loyal and principled. When he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/prisoner-voting-ruling-attorney-general\" title=\"\">told the Commons justice committee</a> that the UK's international reputation would suffer if Britain was seen to be breaking its treaty obligations, he clearly had no idea that the prime minster was going to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/prisoner-voting-ruling-attorney-general\" title=\"\">announce two hours later</a> that it would be doing just that.</p> <p>Grieve has already had to suffer the loss of a well-respected deputy, Sir Edward Garnier. Before the attorney general gave evidence to the justice committee, Cameron should have told him that he had made up his mind on prisoner voting. Unless, that is, the prime minister's decision was simply an off-the-cuff rebuff to whoever had briefed Patrick Wintour for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/tories-bow-to-europe-prisoner-voting-rights\" title=\"\">his story in the Guardian</a>. I suspect that Grieve's sense of duty will override his personal feelings on the issue. As he told MPs, the decision on votes for prisoners is one for parliament and parliament alone. Non-compliance with the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as the European convention is formally called, is not a breach of domestic law.</p> <p>One can even feel some sympathy for Cameron. Labour should have complied with the European court's <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-1463854-1529848 case\" title=\"\">ruling in the Hirst</a>, delivered as long ago as 2005. Instead, it dragged the question of compliance out until it became a problem for Cameron instead.</p> <p>No doubt the Strasbourg court thought it was being helpful by giving the UK more time. It allowed Grieve to make oral representations last November on an Italian case called Scoppola. And the court made significant concessions when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/21/human-rights-court-prisoner-votes-britain\" title=\"\">ruled on that case in May</a>. As Adam Wagner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/22/strasbourg-prisoner-votes-retreat\" title=\"\">commented here</a> at the time, \"It now seems clear that the UK could take a very minimalist approach as to which prisoners receive the vote, for example only those serving six month sentences or less, and still be compliant with the Hirst ruling.\"</p> <p>Cameron would have been wise to have resolved the issue in the early days of his government, blaming his coalition partners if necessary. His latest offer of another Commons vote \u2014 presumably unwhipped, like the last one \u2014 will make no difference to the legal position.</p> <p>As Grieve said, \"there are numerous ways in which government or parliament could, if it wished to, approach the issue of change to the blanket ban. That approach need not necessarily be entirely in the direction of, 'We have got to give more convicted prisoners the vote'.\"</p> <p>What happens next? As Wagner explained, there could be thousands of financial claims. But the government could cope with these, one way or another.</p> <p>All member states of the Council of Europe are required to comply with the human rights convention. The convention requires its signatories \"to abide by the final judgment of the court in any case to which they are parties\". If the UK is not willing to abide by the court's decision in the Hirst case, the honourable thing to do would be for it to leave the Council of Europe.</p> <p>The only state to have done so, temporarily, was Greece under the colonels. We have not come to that yet. The government does not want the UK to leave and the Council of Europe does not want to lose the UK. So perhaps the government is right to think that the worst that will happen to it is condemnation in even stronger terms by the Council of Europe's committee of ministers. No doubt that would be seen as a badge of honour by some Conservative MPs.</p> <p>Those MPs will be equally pleased to have disillusioned the retiring British president of the human rights court.</p> <p>\"The UK complies very well\" with the European convention, Sir Nicolas Bratza <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/21/sir-nicolas-bratza-defends-echr\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> this week. \"Where we find a violation, they correct it. I remain personally hopeful that some solution to this problem [of prisoners' voting rights] that will satisfy the UK parliament and the [ECHR] will be found.\"</p> <p>Now we know that the government does not wish to meet its international obligations. I suspect that nothing very serious will happen as a result. But it is not only at the international level that the government will lose a just little more respect.</p>",
  "<p>You won't see another picture of a leering Jimmy Savile here. I don't want to see any more of him. Really, can the media stop with the Savile imagery now that we know what he did?</p> <p>However, it seems some people are still fundamentally missing the point. This is a story about an environment of abuse, how it flourished in plain sight, how supposedly \"good guys\" did nothing to stop it, and how girls are never really to be trusted. Or never actually a priority.</p> <p>Some weird cultural transference has taken place to turn all this into a crisis of trust in the BBC. In some ways, that's much easier to \"debate\" because it fits several agendas. There will always be those wanting to bash the BBC in a post-Leveson world, in a multi-channel \"why should I not get everything for free?\" world. The critics have been aided by the muffled, ill-informed and frankly useless appearances of those at the top of the organisation. These guys appear to lack ability, humility or even basic empathy. When the bosses of the other institutions, prisons and hospitals involved have to explain how Savile was given a free run to sick and vulnerable people, we may hope they are better prepared.</p> <p>Part of that preparation might be simply to understand what sexual abuse actually <em>is</em>. Comments, such as those attributed to Newsnight editor Peter Rippon about \"just the women\" not being sufficiently credible sources, or about the crimes being not \"the worst kind\" as the girls were not \"too young\", or these not being the worst sort of offences, show not only total ignorance but innate arrogance.</p> <p>There are plenty of organisations that work with those who have been abused, men and women. Some people are deeply damaged. The ones you step over like bags of rubbish as they sleep in doorways, the crack \"whores\" with swivelling chameleon eyes, the women in prisons who night after night try to strangle themselves with homemade ligatures. We could ask such people about how sexual abuse affects one's life.</p> <p>We could ask that much-vilified profession, social workers, about abuse. Indeed, the BBC earlier this year made a brilliant series in Bristol \u2013 Protecting Our Children \u2013 about the dilemmas social workers face in complicated cases where cycles of abuse continue. I know people right now are having to make a decision to remove a child from a family after a series of disclosures about the white stuff that came out of \"Daddy's willy\" when they were having their special time. The last thing this child wants is for her Daddy to be taken away.</p> <p>One current myth is that we now overprotect children, and that in Savile's day it was different. Not so. I worked in residential care homes in the late 1970s and we knew damn well what abuse was. Suspicions would arise about fellow workers and they would be reported and acted upon. Of course, we saw a lot of highly \"sexualised\" behaviour by kids in care, which was difficult to read. The worst was in a lock-up unit where the scale of self-harming \u2013 we didn't use that term then \u2013 was impossible to bear. It was not unusual to hear a girl say her father taught her \"the facts of life\" at 10 by taking her outside and raping her.</p> <p>I am not sorry if this upsets you. It should. We learned that there are different ways of working with victims. For some, abuse at a very young age provides emotional insulation, for others it means a permanent splitting in how they relate to the world. When force had been used, strangely, some girls were able to heal themselves more easily than when it hadn't. This clearly applies to Savile's victims. They felt stupid, disposable and as if they had only themselves to blame.</p> <p>Their silence was amplified by a culture that saw girls as untrustworthy and worthless. This has not gone. Both the right and far left embody virulent anti-women positions. The right focuses on the lone paedophile stranger as it cannot accept that abuse occurs in its sacred heart, the nuclear family. The far left sees abuse as a product of the dreaded middle-class liberal imagination.</p> <p>The failure of agencies to intervene is not new. The cultural whisperings are not new. Check out <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/phreakdown/jimmy-saville-1988\" title=\"\">Jerry Sadowitz's comedy routine about Savile's predilections in the late 1980s</a> or Irvine Welsh's character Freddy Royle in Ecstasy. Remember the silence of those who knew what was going on in the Fred West household. Child rape done in the name of do-gooding is not new. We can look at the blighted history of the missionary position, never mind the Catholic church.</p> <p>So whether a few highly paid TV executives get pensioned off is not my concern. That this predicament should shove aside the voices of the victims disgusts me. Now is the time to listen to those who work with children, to what they tell us about routine gang rape, about pain and anger directly, inwardly, and outwardly. I resent being told about the priorities of this story. For me it is about listening to the realities of young women's lives now, as well as those of Savile's victims. The abuse of power inherent in the phrase \"just the women\" rings as clear as a bell. You can choose to hear it, or not.</p>",
  "<p>For a man who is a bundle of&#xa0;intense, nervous energy, Jacques Audiard is a surprisingly slow worker. Since he started directing, in 1994, he has completed just six features, with lengthy gaps between them. Indeed, the three-year run up to his new film, Rust and Bone, represents something of an acceleration. \"I am free,\" Audiard shrugs, \"because I work for a producer [Pascal Caucheteux] who says, 'We'll go when it's ready.' He doesn't give me a deadline. The films take a long time to write \u2013 too long, perhaps. That is where the time is spent.\"</p> <p>But what films they are. His last, A&#xa0;Prophet, the coruscating study of a French-Arab convict who becomes a player in the Corsican mafia, was four years in the making, and won a runner-up prize at Cannes in 2009; it&#xa0;also made a star of its lead, Tahar Rahim. Before that, in 2005, there was The Beat That My Heart Skipped, a nerve-shredding remake of James Toback's seminal New Hollywood film, Fingers; again, it made a huge star of its lead, Romain Duris, in a role originally played by Harvey Keitel. Rewind another four years and there was Read My Lips, in 2001, in which deaf office worker Emmanuelle Devos falls for hoodlum Vincent Cassel and takes part in a brutal robbery. Read My Lips emerged a full five years after the film that put Audiard on the map: A&#xa0;Self-Made Hero, his fantastically watchable account of a fake Resistance fighter, with a liquidly brilliant central performance by Mathieu Kassovitz.</p> <p>Rust and Bone is a reworking of a&#xa0;book of short stories by Canadian writer Craig Davidson, and of two in particular: the title story and another called Rocket Ride. It's a substantial rewrite: the killer-whale trainer played by Marion Cotillard was originally male; an accident that is a backstory in the book becomes the climax of the film; the film's two central characters live in entirely separate worlds in Davidson's original, and never meet (Audiard's film has them conducting a complex, passionate relationship). Moreover, the film is set in France, in an anti-glamour Riviera of ramshackle workshops, grubby flats and battered wastelands. (This is not, as Audiard is at pains to point out, an assault on the plushness of the C\u00f4te d'Azur; it is simply because the only killer-whale aquarium in France is located in Antibes.)</p> <p>Key to this part of the process is Audiard's scriptwriter, Thomas Bidegain, who worked on A Prophet and also acts as the director's unofficial translator. Sitting in on our interview, he chips in, amplifying his director's words. \"The way we work is to talk about what the film should be, the kind of film we want to do. We were coming out of A Prophet \u2013 a jail movie \u2013 no women, no space, no light, no love. So the idea we had was to do a love story.\"</p> <p>But Audiard, twitching with auteurist pride, cannot be talked over. \"I really believe the form of the film must be in the scenario; cinema is not just added value to the scripting. I believe in it as a totality. There was a specific problem with this film, which we saw often during the writing: the clash between realism and stylisation. You had constantly to be looking for an equilibrium. If it's too realistic, it's boring. If it's too stylised, you don't believe it.\" Bidegain adds: \"What attracted us to the short stories was the universe they described, a universe of catastrophe \u2013 a world where people just have their body left to sell. The characters were normal people, but their destiny is magnified by accidents.\"</p> <p>But this is the director's show, and Audiard wants to talk about a key scene in which Cotillard's character, St\u00e9phanie, loses her legs. In Davidson's story, the incident is described with gruesome precision: the trainer stands on the killer whale's lip, slips, and is horribly mutilated as the animal attempts to eject him from its throat. The film's treatment of this central moment is, in sharp contrast, cryptic and impressionistic; a chaotic, dream-like sequence, slowed down to the point of abstraction. \"We start out very realistic,\" Audiard says. \"We shot the marine show just as it is, very natural. But if you do the accident like that, it would be over so fast. So we go outside the point of view of the character: what we make is more like a fantasy. It could be an image a child dreamed, after the story was told to him.\"</p> <p>That seems as good a rationalisation of Audiard's extraordinarily fluid image-making as you're likely to get from the director. His is an ability that is&#xa0;as confident as cinema has seen for decades. It is not for nothing that Audiard has been repeatedly compared to Martin Scorsese in his Taxi Driver and Raging Bull period; he has the same restless imagination, the same unerring confidence in handling the camera. Audiard is reluctant to explain&#xa0;details \u2013 \"It is immodest, like&#xa0;I&#xa0;am God!\" \u2013 but rather poetically likens his scene-building to \"rolling thunder\", a tension crackling away in&#xa0;the background before the climactic&#xa0;moment.</p> <p>He used CGI for Cotillard's post-amputation scenes, digitally removing her legs. \"It's just a cheap computer manipulation, you know. When we shoot, she's just wearing green socks. You get used to the green socks, then one day we saw the first finished CGI, and you think: Wow! It's really erotic.\" He expands on this: \"We know this from the original story \u2013 that's what the film is about \u2013 she is someone who doesn't like sex before the accident: she's too controlled. She finds in love the possibility to be abandoned, to let go \u2013 she finds out what love is.\"</p> <p>Audiard has been here before. In&#xa0;Read My Lips, the disability is deafness, but the film has a near-identical dramatic drive: a woman whose impairment is an analogue to&#xa0;a&#xa0;repressed emotional life; an insensitive, inarticulate man; a relationship that unlocks them both. Audiard says he never noticed the similarities; it was his editor who pointed them out. But it is this inquisitiveness about his characters' inner lives that really marks Audiard out&#xa0;as a director. For a long time regarded as essentially a crime guy, a&#xa0;modern Jean-Pierre Melville (perhaps&#xa0;due to his predilection for spiffy trilby hats and a pipe), Audiard looks very much like a director with a yen for intense, emotional romances. \"Maybe it's a problem of vocabulary \u2013 'crime' is perhaps too specific a term for what I do.\"</p> <p>Be that as it may, you would have thought Audiard would be a natural candidate for a Hollywood \u2013 or at least an English-language \u2013 transfer, like so many of his French colleagues, with varying degrees of success: everyone from Renoir and Truffaut to Besson and Audiard's former star Mathieu Kassovitz have tried it. The Beat That My Heart Skipped cleverly aligned him with the cultier end of 70s American cinema; and Rust and Bone, after all, could easily have been a boutique Hollywood production, with an Oscar-winning lead. But Audiard remains wary; partly, his sketchy English makes it a tad tricky; and partly he genuinely seems to prefer the unploughed pastures of his homeland. \"If you open&#xa0;the door of a boxing gym in Brooklyn, you know what is behind it. You've seen it 200 times, in 200 films. If you open it in Antibes, it's all new. There is curiosity. Had we set set it in America, it would be a kind of cliche, somehow. You need something to say&#xa0;about the place where you make films. I know Europe. The US I don't know so well. I need a film that sees something, like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did for Milos Forman. It&#xa0;makes it worth the trip.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ankara is pursuing a systematic campaign of intimidation against the Turkish media, including the prosecution and jailing of writers, and demands for those who challenge government policies or actions to be sacked, two independent investigations have concluded.</p> <p>Reports issued in recent days by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the European commission <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/europe/turkey/\" title=\"\">point to a pattern of harassment</a> of individual writers and broadcasters and official pressure on media company owners.</p> <p>Sixty-one journalists are in prison in Turkey as a \"direct result\" of their work or news-gathering activities, said the CPJ. \"Approximately 30% of the imprisoned journalists were accused of participating in anti-government plots or being members of outlawed political groups. About 70% of those jailed were Kurdish journalists charged with aiding terrorism by covering the views and activities of the banned Kurdistan Workers' party [PKK] and the Union of Communities in Kurdistan [KCK].\"</p> <p>It continued: \"More than three-quarters of the imprisoned journalists have not been convicted of a crime but are being held [awaiting] resolution of their cases. Articles in the penal code give authorities wide berth to use journalists' professional work to link them to banned political movements or alleged plots.</p> <p>\"Some of the most frequently used articles criminalise basic news-gathering activities, such as talking to security officials or obtaining documents. Up to 5,000 criminal cases were pending against journalists at the end of 2011, according to Turkish press freedom groups.\"</p> <p>The CPJ also said it had detected increased internet filtering of domestic news sources, including opposition and pro-Kurdish media.</p> <p>The European commission's findings, part of the annual \"progress report\" on Turkey's EU membership application, also make disturbing reading.</p> <p>\"The increasing incidence of violations of freedom of expression raise serious concerns and freedom of the media continued to be further restricted in practice. The increasing tendency to imprison journalists, media workers and distributors fuelled these concerns.</p> <p>\"High-level government and state officials and the military repeatedly turn publicly against the press and launch court cases. On a number of occasions journalists have been fired [for] articles openly critical of the government.</p> <p>\"All of this, combined with a high concentration of the media in industrial conglomerates with interests going far beyond the free circulation of information and ideas, has a chilling effect and limits freedom of expression in practice, while making self-censorship a common phenomenon in the Turkish media.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2012/package/tr_rapport_2012_en.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> said many prosecutions targeted writers, academics and journalists writing and working on the Kurdish issue, but also scholars and researchers. More than 2,800 students are in detention, mostly on terrorism-related charges. Legislation covering such offences was \"imprecise and contains definitions which are open to abuse\".</p> <p>The government has not commented on the CPJ's findings, but the commission's progress report provoked sharp criticism, with the minister for EU affairs, Egemen Bagis, rejecting it as a \"broken mirror\", adding that it did not accurately reflect the situation in Turkey.</p> <p>Burhan Kuzu, head of the parliamentary commission charged with writing a new constitution and a member of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), told CNN Turk television the report was rubbish.</p> <p>\"This is a report to be thrown in the trash. There is no trash can here, so I'm throwing it on the floor.\" Kuzu then threw the report on the floor, saying: \"Here, I'm throwing it into the trash.\"</p> <p>Kadri G\u00fcrsel, a leading newspaper columnist and chairman of the Turkish national committee of the Vienna-based <a href=\"http://www.freemedia.at\" title=\"\">International Press Institute</a> said the media in Turkey was under constant pressure to toe the official line.</p> <p>\"More than half the print media are directly or indirectly controlled by the government's cronies and its proxy capitalists. The other half is in a hostage situation,\" G\u00fcrsel said. Owners and employees of opposition media faced the ever-present threat of being prosecuted or arrested, which led them to curb what they said or wrote.</p> <p>\"This stops them practising independent journalism. To be honest, news is not the main instinct, it is self-censorship. When news comes to the news desk, the first question that occurs, unavoidably, is: 'Does this matter harm the government interest?'\"</p> <p>Although the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had accumulated \"unprecedented power\" during nearly 10 year in office, there was virtually no public scrutiny of the AKP and no investigations into the lifestyles and business interests of ministers and their relatives.</p> <p>\"Since 2008 [after the party began its second term in office], there has been not one single corruption case reported by the media that could or would hurt government interests,\" G\u00fcrsel said.</p> <p>A former national newspaper editor who asked not be identified said Erdogan had made a habit of singling out journalists whose pieces offended him, and demanding their sacking. But government pressure on media companies was usually more subtle, he said.</p> <p>\"You can never prove it, but I'm sure messages are sent [to media owners]. The government very often intervenes. And the media magnates want to secure sympathy or curry favours from the government. But they never leave their fingerprints,\" the former editor said.</p> <p>Far from feeling ashamed, Erdogan and his supporters appear to believe their actions are fully justified. A <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pms-cases-against-journalists-stanching-criticism-lawyer-says.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=33059&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">report</a> this week in the Aksam newspaper quoted Ali \u00d6zkaya, a lawyer acting for Erdogan, as saying lawsuits opened on his behalf against people who have \"insulted\" him in the press have had a salutary effect.</p> <p>\"We have to underline that cases we've opened against press have been quite a deterrent; the wording of columnists has noticeably changed especially since 2003 [when Erdogan took office]. Reporters and columnists do not exceed the dose when making criticisms any more. Insulting comments or columns have been reduced to minimum.\"</p>",
  "<p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in bullish mood. Hailed by supporters as the country's greatest statesman since the republic's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's prime minister was addressing a recent congress of his neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP).</p> <p>For more than two hours Erdogan pounded out his message, made self-serving comparisons with the past, and listed his achievements. According to Erdogan, echoing the former British prime minister Harold Macmillan, Turks have never had it so good.</p> <p>\"Before we came to power [in 2002], there was no economic stability, no safety, no democracy in this country,\" Erdogan said. \"The era of coups in this country will never return again ... In a country where the majority is Muslim, we let democracy rule in its most advanced form and became an example for all Muslim countries.\"</p> <p>This is not how the 50% of Turks who did not back the AKP in last year's elections see it. \"Erdogan is very authoritarian now. He's too sure of himself. His attitudes are very dangerous for Turkey and for the world,\" said Sezgin Tanrikulu, deputy leader of the opposition Republican People's party (CHP).</p> <p>\"We are witnessing the creation of a cult of personality,\" said Milliyet columnist and media activist Kadri G\u00fcrsel. \"Erdogan is becoming an elected sultan. The party congress was a one-man show ... He thinks he is the only person who can design Turkey's destiny. He suffers from a hubris syndrome.\"</p> <p>Not so, said Nursuna Memecan, an AKP MP and Erdogan friend. \"Erdogan is not authoritarian. He is detail-oriented, a micro-manager ... In our part of the world, you can't rely on delegating. So he delegates, then he oversees,\" she said. \"In a period of reform, you have to take the lead. He makes decisions \u2013 and he get things done.\"</p> <p>Like him or loathe him, both supporters and detractors agree Erdogan dominates Turkey's political scene. To his fans, he is a dynamic, modernising force. To opponents, he is divisive, even threatening. \"The AKP is not a party any more. It is Erdogan's apparatus. There is huge polarisation in this country,\" said journalist and writer Cengiz Aktar.</p> <p>Who and what Erdogan really is \u2013 dictator or democrat, visionary or villain, swaggering bully or charismatic reformer \u2013 matters more than ever these days, and not just to Turkey's nearly 80 million people.</p> <p>But every bit as important is the question of how much longer Erdogan can maintain his grip after almost a decade in power. Problems are crowding in, and for the first time in years, the prime minister looks vulnerable.</p> <p>As the Arab spring unfolded across the Middle East, Erdogan initially took credit as an exemplar and guide. Muslim Turkey's secular democracy, with one foot in the west and one in the Middle East, was held up as a model. When he toured Egypt and Tunisia last year, Erdogan was hailed as a hero.</p> <h2>Syrian civil war<br></h2> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syrian civil war </a>has dealt a rude blow to his cherished concept of Turkish regional leadership. Erdogan's attempts to persuade President Bashar al-Assad to choose reform over repression were flatly rejected, a rebuff he took personally. His subsequent outspoken demands that Assad step down have been ignored.</p> <p>\"Erdogan underestimated Assad's staying power,\" said Fuat Keyman, director of the Istanbul Policy Centre. \"As it stands, the Syrian crisis is very dangerous, not just for Turkey but also because it could spread to Lebanon and Jordan ... The longer Syria goes on, the worse it is for Erdogan.\"</p> <p>Erdogan has come a long way from a devout Muslim upbringing in the tough, working-class Istanbul district of Kasimpasa. After attending an Islamic school and Marmara University, he became a professional footballer before getting involved in politics. Elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994, he became leader of the neo-Islamist Welfare party and was subsequently jailed, briefly, for allegedly trying to subvert Turkey's secular order.</p> <p>In 2001, after the Welfare party was banned, Erdogan helped found the AKP on a platform of jobs, better services and fairness for Turkey's urban and rural masses. The AKP emerged as the largest party in the 2002 election. In 2003, after a bar on him holding public office was lifted, Erdogan became prime minister.</p> <p>He made a hesitant start. He fought off legal attempts to ban the AKP. He struggled to maintain friendly ties with the US during the Iraq invasion. His party was accused of attempting to \"Islamise\" Turkish society, for example, by relaxing the ban on Muslim women wearing headscarves. Turkey's EU membership bid was humiliatingly blocked by France and Germany.</p> <p>But through a mixture of toughness and calibrated moderation, Erdogan survived. In the years that followed, his grip on power gradually extended to encompass all of Turkey's institutions.</p> <p>His political ally, former foreign minister Abdullah G\u00fcl, was installed as president. Opposition parties splintered under the AKP onslaught. A once-hostile judiciary is now wholly under his sway, or so his critics claim. The media is either supportive, or intimidated into silence, say leading journalists. And the once powerful military, at the heart of Turkey's shadowy \"deep state\", has been neutralised as a political force, not least through this year's so-called Sledgehammer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/turkey-sledgehammer-coup-trial-verdict\" title=\"\">trial of hundreds of alleged army coup plotters</a>.</p> <p>Erdogan, barred from standing for a fourth term, is widely expected to seek the presidency in 2014, but only after he has enacted a new constitution that would endow what is at present a largely ceremonial post with new powers.</p> <p>For Erdogan's idea to work, the hitherto loyal G\u00fcl must step aside, or agree to act as powerless prime minister \u2013 a swap similar to that made by Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in Russia. Indeed, critics often liken Erdogan to Putin, a comparison that is decidedly uncomplimentary, and meant to be.</p> <h2>'Constitutional coup'<br></h2> <p>For Turkey's liberal middle classes, the pro-western intelligentsia, old school Kemalists and the rightwing nationalists who comprise the fractured opposition, Erdogan's plan amounts to a de facto \"constitutional coup\".</p> <p>\"For Erdogan, getting elected president is no problem. He's popular. It's a piece of cake,\" said a former newspaper editor. \"His problem is how to extend the powers of the presidency. He needs to change the constitution. But he is short of the two-thirds majority he needs in parliament.</p> <p>\"Probably [Erdogan's] plan will fail. So if there is no change, he has to ensure the new PM will do what he says. The problem with that is that Abdullah G\u00fcl may not do what Erdogan wants. There are signs of a widening gap between the two.\"</p> <p>Erdogan's grip on power may also be undermined by the economy. Average per capita income has trebled since 2002 and an ambitious programme of public investment in roads, housing, schools and infrastructure has fed a booming economy and his own popularity. But output has begun to fall.</p> <p>\"If the economy goes down, everything will change,\" one analyst predicted.</p> <h2>Kurdish problem<br></h2> <p>Another vexed issue is the Kurdish problem, which Erdogan promised to solve but which appears more acute than ever. This year has recorded an upsurge in Kurdistan Workers' party attacks on targets in south-east Turkey and while Erdogan hints at resumed talks, the nascent peace process that collapsed last year is effectively moribund.</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of elected Kurdish politicians, journalists, academics and activists have been jailed under sweeping, catch-all anti-terror legislation, and hundreds of Kurdish prisoners are on hunger strike, according to Ihsan Kagar of the Turkish Human Rights Association. For all his bluster, Erdogan appears to have no answers.</p> <p><strong>Pious generation</strong></p> <p>Suspicions also persist about Erdogan's declared ambition of raising a \"pious generation\", about the AKP's links to the Fethullah G\u00fclen movement, an influential Islamist NGO, and the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas in Gaza. Critics insist his secret aim is to overturn Turkey's secular tradition and create an Islamist state. Supporters respond that if this were the case, he is being very slow about it. Such tensions are more about class than religion, they say.</p> <p>\"People who say such things are just trying to find ways to criticise him,\" said Nursuna Memecan. \"He wants to include people, and the privileged groups don't like that. They are taking time getting used to sitting next to people from Anatolia smelling of cows. So they create rumours that Erdogan is a dictator and must be stopped.\"</p> <p>Further question marks surround his health. He underwent an operation for an intestinal problem last year, but the nature of his illness and his current state of health are matters for conjecture. Those who have seen him up close say he looks tired and older than his 58 years.</p> <p>All the same it would be a big mistake to suggest the Erdogan era is drawing to a close \u2013 not yet at least. \"We are talking about the most powerful politician in Turkey since Ataturk,\" said Kadri Gursel. \"He is aggressive. He follows a policy of divide and rule. He is a populist. The poor urban classes like his style. His followers are Sunni, conservative, nationalist and from the same social background as him. Erdogan is a street-fighter. He is a survivor. And he wins.\"</p>",
  "<p>Euroscepticism in the UK seems as widespread as ever, with fears about the debt crisis and clashes over issues of employment law just a few items regularly in the news. But few people probably stop to ponder what Europe means to us Brits when it comes to the scientific sphere.</p> <p>It's worth thinking about now as the EU attempts to hammer out an overall budget for the next seven years, with the summit of the European Union heads of state on 22 and 23 November being a key milestone.</p> <p>David Cameron, along with a number of other leaders, is lobbying vigorously to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20040340\">oppose</a> an increase in the next budget above inflation. But the truth is that the EU funds a lot of British science, and Horizon 2020, the EU's research programme, is part of the budget under threat. According to the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE), <a href=\"http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/?p=11247\">what's at stake</a> is \u20ac80bn (\u00a363bn) in research funding, with the UK enjoying a larger-than-average share of this pot. </p> <p>Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.no-cuts-on-research.eu\">a petition</a> aimed at fighting cuts to the EU science budget went live, sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.initiative-science-europe.org/\">the Initiative for Science in Europe</a>. ISE is an independent platform of European learned societies and scientific organisations striving to support science and to affect science policy at a European level, involving scientists themselves whenever possible. </p> <p>Wolfgang Eppenschwandtner, the executive coordinator of ISE, told me that the petition is truly grassroots, having been initiated by young scientists holding Starting Grants from the European Research Council. The movement, coordinated with the publication of <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ac318e22-19f6-11e2-a179-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2ACx2sezc\">a high-profile letter</a> signed by a large number of European Nobel laureates and Fields medalists, quickly caught fire. Eppenschwandtner added that the ultimate target of the petition was the meeting of Heads of State, which will decide on the spending for the major headings (research and innovation being one of them).</p> <p>It certainly sounds like a no-brainer. I have, however, heard that a few scientists are somewhat uneasy about supporting the petition, worried that an increase of the UK's contribution to the EU might well come at the expense of the constrained \u2013 and always vulnerable \u2013 domestic science budget. So I asked Imrah Khan, head of CaSE, what he thought about the petition, and whether there were any downsides. </p> <p>\"Obviously the government wants to keep our contributions to the EU down,\" he replied, \"but if this comes at the expense of research spending then we'll be cutting off our nose to spite our face. The UK benefits disproportionately from the European science spending, and we should absolutely join the Dutch on insisting on protection for that budget.\" He added, \"Not only does this money come from a different pot from the UK's science spend, but the two budgets operate in synergy \u2013 so we have everything to gain from this European collaboration.\"</p> <p>Just before I submitted this post for publication, the petition had over 40,000 signatures. The UK was 3rd, behind Spain and Germany. You don't have to be a scientist to care about science, which is good for the economy and brings so many benefits to our daily lives. So please sign the petition and help spread the word.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.davidsware.com/home\" title=\"David S Ware's official website\">David S Ware</a>, the saxophonist whose monumental sound matched his physical stature, has died aged 62 following complications from a kidney transplant he underwent in 2009. Ware, who was mentored by Sonny Rollins and worked with the free-jazz piano virtuoso Cecil Taylor, was one of the few structure-busting radicals in jazz history to reach beyond the music's cognoscenti without compromise.</p> <p>His impassioned, wounded-beast sound inspired a devoted following, despite his rejection of the accessible song structures commonly used in jazz. The journalist Gary Giddins wrote in 2001: \"Every time I see Ware's group or return to the records, it flushes the competition from memory.\" The film-maker David Lynch, whose foundation backed a recent documentary about Ware, simply marvelled: \"<a href=\"http://dlf.tv/2011/david-s-ware/\" title=\"David Lynch on David S Ware\">How cool is cool?</a>\"</p> <p>A first encounter with Ware's music could be an intimidating experience. He seemed to have arrived from another dimension, unleashing an ambiguously pitched, bagpipe-like sound without obvious antecedents \u2013 though there were audible links with the saxophonists <a href=\"http://www.pharoahsanders.net/\" title=\"Pharoah Sanders\">Pharoah Sanders</a>, Albert Ayler and Rahsaan Roland Kirk.</p> <p>A profoundly religious man, and a lifelong practitioner of yoga and meditation, Ware was preoccupied with nothing less than humanity's place in the cosmos \u2013 he often seemed to be stretching for a musical equivalent to the heat and raw noise of the universe in transition or, as he put it in a conversation with Rollins in 2005, \"musically to go so deep that you touch upon those universal forces\". On another occasion, he observed that the improvising strategy of his early years was simply to \"come out blasting \u2026 like I was coming out of a cannon\".</p> <p>Ware was born and raised in New Jersey. From the age of 10, he played alto, baritone and tenor saxophone. He attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston from 1967 to 1969 and formed the Boston-based free-jazz group Apogee, including the pianist Cooper-Moore and the drummer Marc Edwards. But if he was already indifferent to conventional jazz storytelling, or the principles of tension and release, Ware was far from indifferent to saxophone expertise.</p> <p>Having introduced himself to Rollins on a Manhattan street corner in 1969, he began to study advanced techniques \u2013 and discussed eastern religion and spiritual perspectives in the context of extended breath control \u2013 with the jazz superstar in the latter's Brooklyn apartment. In 1973 Rollins even engaged Apogee as a support band on one of his appearances at the Village Vanguard in New York \u2013 a piece of bold patronage that did not go down universally well with his fans.</p> <p>In 1974 he performed in an orchestra led by Taylor at Carnegie Hall. Through the 1970s, Ware was involved with the popular loft-jazz scene in New York and worked regularly with Taylor's sidemen Raphe Malik (trumpet) and Andrew Cyrille (drums). After beginning to record under his own name, and working with the bebop pianist Barry Harris, he embarked on a 14-year stretch (1981-95) as a New York cab driver to pay the bills. During this period, he was sporadically active in Europe, and in 1988 he formed his most compatible band \u2013 with the bassist William Parker, who he had met in Taylor's orchestra, the pianist Matthew Shipp and a succession of imaginative drummers.</p> <p>The Swedish label Silkheart and the Japanese label DIW caught these musicians in scorching form. Ware had previously been too untamed a performer to reach beyond the niche audience, but broadening public tastes for ambient sounds, ethnic influences, improv and noise were joining a general upswing in jazz popularity during the 1990s. The saxophonist Branford Marsalis seized the moment to sign Ware to Columbia in 1997 for his first and only major-label deal. Though the albums Go See the World and Surrendered were not his strongest, they brought Ware an enthusiastic new public.</p> <p>He recorded extensively for his manager Steven Joerg's AUM Fidelity label from 2001, including a dramatic reworking of Rollins's Freedom Suite and a magnificent, Coltrane-reminiscent live recording from the 2006 Vision festival in New York, Renunciation. Ware also recorded for the eclectic independent label Thirsty Ear, often confirming that his earlier full-on methods were changing in middle life. BalladWare (1999) included bittersweet reworkings of Autumn Leaves and Yesterdays; Threads (2003) explored a sonically subtle music with strings, and a belated but characteristically creative interest in more song-centred materials was plainly audible on a compilation of Swiss and Italian live shows, Live in the World (1998-2003).</p> <p>Ware was in need of regular dialysis for kidney failure from the late 1990s, and in May 2009 Laura Mehr \u2013 whose late husband had been inspired by artistic and spiritual discussions with Ware 30 years earlier \u2013 donated a kidney when the saxophonist's health hit crisis point. By October, Ware was back in action. He recorded several more albums, ending with Planetary Unknown: Live at Jazzfestival Saalfelden 2011. Ware was always unmistakably himself, embodying jazz's drive towards independent creativity \u2013 unmoved by trends and eschewing imitation \u2013 in its purest form.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Setsuko.</p> <p>\u2022 David Spencer Ware, saxophonist, born 7 November 1949; died 18 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>The attempt by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z to register their infant daughter's name as a trade mark in the US appears to be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/beyonces-blue-ivy-trademark-application-still-alive-but-moving-slowly/2012/10/23/9e5023fa-1d5b-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_blog.html\" title=\"\">continuing</a> in spite of the fact that a wedding planner, who has been running a business with the same name since 2009, has been given the go ahead by the US Patent and Trademark Office to carry on using the name Blue Ivy for events.</p> <p>In countries where the stars succeed in registering Blue Ivy Carter as a trade mark they acquire the exclusive right to use their infant's moniker in connection with selected categories of goods and services there. But are Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z making good use of trade mark law?</p> <p>\"A trade mark's purpose is to let the public know that goods come from a particular trade source; that your bottle of Coca-Cola or your Arsenal t-shirt are genuine,\" says Christina Michalos, a trade mark and intellectual property barrister. \"Trying to register the name of a baby that, as yet, can't even speak let alone endorse goods is a waste of time and an illustration of the depths to which celebrity cash-in culture has sunk.\"</p> <p>A defensive action by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z to prevent other people trading on their child's name is not an appropriate use of trade mark rights either, according to Michalos. \"It's no answer to say it is a pre-emptive application to stop others cashing in,\" she says. \"The trade mark registry grants rights for the very purpose of enabling trade, not to operate as a personal lock-up.\"</p> <p>It is not uncommon for famous people to make trade mark applications, Julian Assange has successfully registered <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&amp;trademark=2572177\" title=\"\">his name as a trade mark in the UK</a> and as <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ohim?ohimnum=E9734096\" title=\"\">Community Trade Mark </a>(in Europe) for services including public speaking, journalism and entertainment. Even <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-find-adp?propnum=0974383001\" title=\"\">Alan Titchmarsh</a> has four trade marks in his name.</p> <p>Paul Jordan, intellectual property expert at law firm Bristows, takes a different view to Michalos. The benefits of registration are two-fold he says: \"Firstly, it simplifies a celebrity's ability to licence his or her own name for commercial value; and secondly, it provides them with a powerful weapon to restrain an unconnected third party's unauthorised use.\"</p> <p>Jordan is unsurprised that the Carters are aggressively seeking to protect the use of their daughter's name and they have been more successful in Europe where, in September, <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ohim?ohimnum=\" e10659514\"\" title=\"\">Blue Ivy Carter was registered as a Community Trade Mark</a> for a range of goods and services including cosmetics, fragrances, hair accessories, DVDs, baby strollers, clothing and entertainment services.</p> <p>\"Given that a child is unlikely to be able to rely upon unregistered rights to protect its name and likeness, applying to register a trade mark is perhaps the most obvious option as there is no requirement to demonstrate a history of commercial endorsement,\" he says. The position is different in the US where proof of commerical use of the name is required in order to obtain a trade mark and this may, ultimately, put paid to registration.</p> <p>\"Obviously there's nothing wrong with registering a person's name if it truly is a stamp of trade origin; the names of fashion designers are commonly registered as trade marks,\" says Michalos. \"But it should not be forgotten that a name once registered as a trade mark becomes a piece of property that can be bought and sold. In practical terms, it means that an individual can lose the right to stop others trading under their own name.\"</p> <p>What seems odd about turning your child's name into a trade mark is that, in legal terms, it involves an element of depersonalisation. As Michalos says: \"Registering a name as a trade mark converts it into an item of intellectual property which is a commodity entirely separate from the person concerned.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hands up if you know your national insurance number. If you are telling the truth, far fewer than half of you do. Does it matter? Well, in two years' time, if you don't, you won't be eligible to register to vote.</p> <p>Some of you may have been vaguely aware that the coalition government has announced its intention to move towards individual registration of voters by 2015. In the modern world, it is perhaps better to place this responsibility on individuals than on heads of households. However, individual voting registration is one thing, and making it a requirement to provide a national insurance number is quite another. Many people would be unwilling to provide this because of a reasonable fear that, when combined with a date of birth (which has also been requested), it could lead to identity theft. <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/05/25/interview-ben-page\" title=\"\">Ben Page</a>, head of polling organisation Ipsos Mori, estimates that barely 25% of the population know their NI number. It does seem bizarre that you can open a bank account without providing your NI number but you soon won't be eligible to vote without it. The independent Electoral Commission has estimated that 73% of the electorate would be concerned if they were asked to provide their NI number and that 15% of the electorate, or 6 million voters, would be deterred from registering to vote.</p> <p>So how have we arrived here? First, there's the conspiracy theory: this is a form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression\" title=\"\">voter suppression</a> more commonly associated with states in the deep south of the US. Certainly all the evidence suggests that it will predominately be those under 30 who will fail to register to vote in the new regime. Then there's the cock-up theory: when individual voting registration was discussed in the Commons, there was no suggestion of an NI requirement, only a signature. When it got to the Cabinet Office, it was realised that this would be a barrier to online registration. The instant solution by Whitehall's finest was the NI option \u2013 except that it isn't a good idea for all the reasons outlined above. As for Ed Miliband's idea of mass registration of voters, forget it. Who is going to give their date of birth and NI details to a random stranger on the doorstep in the dark?</p> <p>The tragedy is that Britain has a proud record of effective voter registration. Thanks to the unsung efforts of council electoral registration officers throughout the land, we have built up an internationally respected form of civic registration. Of course, it could be modernised, and online registration is the way forward, but not in the way the Cabinet Office (which has little experience of the practical issues relating to voter registration) has suggested.</p> <p>We are facing the collapse of our electoral register with all the implications for democratic participation, which will also have profound implications for the future composition of juries (jury lists are compiled from electoral registers). At the final hour the heavy guns have got involved. Graham Allen MP, the formidable chairman of the public administration select committee, has written to every peer asking them to register their concern as the proposed legislation receives their scrutiny from 29 October. In the modern world it seems we have to rely on unelected peers to protect the franchise.</p>",
  "<p>A hero of South Africa's struggle who is now a business tycoon has been accused of having the blood of Marikana mineworkers on his hands after the release of emails he sent to mine management and government ministries.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=1009\" title=\"\">Cyril Ramaphosa</a>, who 25 years ago led the National Union of Mineworkers in a key strike against the white minority regime, was criticised for betraying the very people he used to represent.</p> <p>Soweto-born Ramaphosa, 59, co-authored the widely revered post-apartheid constitution and remains a patrician figure in the governing African National Congress \u2013 but his business interests include a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owns the platinum mine where, two months ago, a wildcat strike led to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/marikana-mine-shootings-revive-soweto\" title=\"\">police massacre of 34 workers</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the official commission of inquiry into the Marikana tragedy was shown a stash of emails written by Ramaphosa, suggesting that he sought to intervene with senior government figures on Lonmin's behalf. On the eve of the killings, he called for action against miners engaged in \"dastardly criminal\" conduct.</p> <p>His apparent switch of sides is being described as a parable of how South Africa's liberators became seduced by crony capitalism. \"It's a personal tragedy,\" said Adam Habib, a professor of political science at Johannesburg University. \"This is the general secretary of the NUM 25 years ago and architect of the South African constitution. It's a symbolic example of the degeneration of a cadre and civil activist and how he has become entrapped by his newfound wealth. It resonates so powerfully because It's typical of many in the ANC.\"</p> <p>Workers at the Lonmin mine went on strike on 10 August. Within four days, 10 people had been killed, including two policemen and two security guards, prompting Ramaphosa to email Albert Jamieson, Lonmin's chief commercial officer. \"The terrible events that have unfolded cannot be described as a labour dispute,\" he wrote. \"They are plainly dastardly criminal and must be characterised as such \u2026 There needs to be concomitant action to address this situation.\"</p> <p>Releasing the email to the commission, advocate Dali Mpofu, who is representing injured mineworkers and more than 200 who were arrested, said: \"This was on 15 August at 2.58pm, exactly 24 hours before the people were mowed down on that mountain. We have emails that were being exchanged between Lonmin management, government ministers [of mineral resources and the police] and at the centre is a gentleman called Cyril Ramaphosa.\"</p> <p>Mpofu said Ramaphosa had called for action to deal with the \"criminals\", whose crime was to seek a wage increase.</p> <p>\"It is clear Ramaphosa was directly involved by advising what was to be done to address these 'dastardly criminal actions', which he says must be characterised as such and dealt with effectively.\" The emails showed a direct \"toxic collusion\" between Ramaphosa, Lonmin, mineral resources minister Susan Shabangu's department, the police ministry and state security agencies, he added, describing the shootings as \"premeditated murder of defenceless people\".</p> <p>Ramaphosa warned the police minister, Nathi Mthethwa, to come down hard on the strikers, and was lobbied by Lonmin management to \"influence\" Shabangu and advised her that \"silence and inaction\" on the events was \"bad for her and government\", it was claimed.</p> <p>An email from Ramaphosa with the subject heading \"Security Situation\" reads: \"You are absolutely correct in insisting that the minister [Shabangu] and indeed all government officials need to understand that we are essentially dealing with a criminal act. I have said as much to the minister of safety and security.\"</p> <p>In another email, Ramaphosa highlights his \"interaction with some of the roleplayers\", including a proposed conversation with the ANC secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, to suggest that the party intervene. There was also a proposed meeting with Shabangu in Cape Town to discuss \"what she needs to do\".</p> <p>Two days after the shooting, Ramaphosa's Shanduka company announced he had donated R2m (\u00a3142,315) towards the funeral costs of the miners. <a href=\"http://www.shanduka.co.za/news-releases/WHAT-WE-DO-NOW-WILL-DEFINE-US-AS-A-NATION/index.html?&amp;re=1\" title=\"\">He wrote in South Africa's Sunday Times</a>: \"There are few innocents in this tragic saga \u2026 For wherever we find ourselves, we cannot escape the sense that, through our action or inaction, we bear some responsibility for the circumstances that made such a tragedy possible.

Earlier this year he chaired a party disciplinary appeals committee that upheld the expulsion of ANC youth league president Julius Malema.</p> <p>Siphiwo Gqala, a miner in Marikana who survived the massacre, said on Wednesday: \"I'm so angry with Cyril Ramaphosa. Now there are rumours of him going for deputy president. They will be voting for someone [in December] who sent an email saying they must do something about us.\"</p> <p>The ANC youth league called for Ramaphosa to apologise to the families of the injured and dead. \"As a seasoned unionist, the ANC Youth League expected more from comrade Ramaphosa,\" spokeswoman Khusela Sangoni-Khawe said.</p> <p>\"The criminal acts he spoke of were the legitimate calls of workers demanding a decent wage. We concur with the assertions made by the legal representative of the workers: Marikana was a premeditated murder of our people and comrade Cyril has the blood of Marikana workers on his hands.\"</p> <p>She added: \"He has clearly decided to nail his flag to the mast of capital. He has sold out the people.\"</p> <p>Rehad Desai, spokesman for the Marikana Support Campaign, said: \"The journey of Cyril Ramaphosa from a talented, assiduous, brave trade union leader to a crony capitalist is a tremendous arc. It's highly disappointing for our campaign supporters who held him in high esteem over the years. We should call on the ANC to seriously consider his membership if they want to retain the respect of thinking South Africans.\"</p> <p>Ramaphosa, who last month apologised on national radio for extravagantly bidding R18m (\u00a31.28m) for a buffalo and its calf, declined to comment on the emails. Lonmin stated: \"Lonmin's action to engage with appropriate authorities of the state was simply part of a process aimed at achieving normality.\"When a graphic video of the 34 strikers being shot dead by police was played at the commission on Tuesday, many grieving widows, wearing black mourning headscarves, erupted in tears.

  "<p>Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, has called on Iran to reconsider the \"outrageous\" and \"deplorable\" detention of the prominent lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, who is on the eighth day of a hunger strike.</p> <p>Sotoudeh is serving a six-year jail term in Tehran's notorious Evin prison after being found guilty of \"acting against the national security\" and \"propaganda against the regime\" \u2013 charges that human rights activists say were trumped-up.</p> <p>Last week, Sotoudeh, a mother of two children, stopped eating in protest at the state's harassment of her family. Her husband, Reza Khandan, and their 12-year-old daughter, Mehraveh, are subject to a travel ban and have been summoned to court, in what Amnesty International describes as an attempt to force her family to stop campaigning for her release.</p> <p>The 45-year-old women's rights activist was arrested in September 2010 and initially sentenced to 11 years in prison but had her conviction reduced to six years' imprisonment last year.</p> <p>Sotoudeh's arrest was believed to be linked to her representation of Shirin Ebadi, a colleague and Iranian Nobel peace prize laureate currently living in exile.</p> <p>\"Imprisoning Nasrin Sotoudeh on the outrageous basis of 'co-operation with Shirin Ebadi's Centre for the Defence of Human Rights' is deplorable,\" Hague told the Guardian. \"We urge the Iranian authorities to review her case urgently. We will continue to stand up for human rights defenders in Iran\".</p> <p>A spokesman for the EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, echoed Hague's remarks. \"We are following the case of Nasrin Sotoudeh and other human rights defenders in Iran with great concern,\" said the spokesman. \"We will continue to campaign for the charges against them to be dropped, and look to Iran to respect the human rights obligations it has signed up to.\"</p> <p>During a visit to Tehran in August, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, pressed Iranian officials over the country's record on human rights. In October, the UN's Iran special rapporteur on human rights, Ahmed Shaheed, heavily criticised Tehran in a report detailing the harassment of its imprisoned activists who are subjected to mock executions, rape, sleep deprivation, and threats to their families.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Ali Larijani, the speaker of the Iranian parliament, attacked Ban and Shaheed in an unusually brusque speech, denying the human rights allegations against his country. He accused Ban of humiliating the identity of the United Nations with what he described as a \"political dance\" and likened Shaheed's report to \"international savagery\".</p> <p>\"You [the west] seem to expect us to respect the western savagery in sodomy as legal,\" said Larijani.</p> <p>In Evin prison, north of the Iranian capital, Sotoudeh is held behind bars alongside some of the defendants she represented, including several political activists and protesters arrested in the aftermath of Iran's 2009 disputed presidential election.</p> <p>Sotoudeh's own lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, has also been arrested and sentenced to 13 years in jail, as well as many of their colleagues, including Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, who saved the life of an Iranian Christian pastor on death row for apostasy.</p> <p>Others in jail include Houtan Kian, the lawyer who fell foul of the authorities for highlighting the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, the woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. Kian was arrested in 2010 and has been allegedly subjected to torture. The fate of both Ashtiani and Kian is unclear.</p> <p>Sotoudeh's human rights activities have been recognised internationally, especially her defence of juvenile offenders. Iran has been <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2007/06/19/iran-leads-world-executing-children\" title=\"\">notorious for its execution of juveniles</a>, but now waits until the age of 18 before carrying out death sentences handed down to those under that age. In 2011 at least 143 child offenders were on death row in Iranian prisons, waiting to go to the gallows on their 18th birthday.</p> <p>\"Several officials from different organizations have talked to her, but nothing serious has happened to lead to her ending her hunger strike,\" Sotoudeh's husband, Khandan, told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a US-based non-governmental organisation. \"Nasrin has demands, the most important one of which is for the pressure to be lifted from her family, particularly our 12-year-old daughter who has been banned from foreign travel.\"</p> <p>According to Khandan, Sotoudeh appeared haggard and weak during a prison visit with her family on Sunday. \"She appeared a lot more frail after five days of hunger strike, as compared to two years ago, when she was on a hunger strike for 28 days,\" he said. \"The reason for this is quite clear. She has lost her strength over the past two years in prison and she no longer has the strength for a hunger strike.</p> <p>\"I am seriously worried for her since I saw her yesterday. No matter how hard I tried to talk her out of the hunger strike, Nasrin had no interest in breaking it.\"</p> <p>While in jail, Sotoudeh has repeatedly been denied visits from her children, including once for refusing to wear a chador, the full-length cloak worn by Iranian women. \"I know that you require water, food, housing, a family, parents, love, and visits with your mother,\" she wrote to her children in a letter from jail, according to the opposition website <a href=\"http://persian2english.com/\" title=\"\">persian2english.com</a> . \"However, just as much, you need freedom, social security, the rule of law, and justice.\"</p>",

  "<p>One agency in the US has the power to invade and investigate the White House: the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Its extraordinary powers make it the closest thing the country has to a secret police. With the intelligence at its command, the FBI can make presidents, and break them.</p> <p>Information is power; secret information is power squared. And eyes-only intelligence secured for the president \u2013 or against him \u2013 is the political equivalent of a nuclear warhead. Its mere possession is sufficient to deter an enemy, and the FBI's J Edgar Hoover had an arsenal unsurpassed in the annals of 20th-century America. Forty years after his death, the FBI still has that power, along with the keys and codes to unleash it. It was the FBI that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html\" title=\"toppled President Richard Nixon\">toppled President Richard Nixon</a>, made felony cases against President Ronald Reagan's national security team, and withdrew the blood and the DNA from President Bill Clinton that brought him to impeachment for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUDppdVXeMw\" title=\"lying about sex\">lying about sex</a>.</p> <p>The FBI has been with us for 104 years, and for much of the past century its relationships with presidents have been marked by a ferocious tug-of-war. Only in the past three years, under Obama, has a delicate balance between national security and civil liberties approached equilibrium. No other Democratic president has been free of the fear of the power of the FBI since Lyndon B Johnson took office in 1963. Harry Truman worried aloud that the Bureau would become an \"American Gestapo\". John F Kennedy knew Hoover had 20-year-old sex tapes of his liaison with a suspected Nazi agent, and he shared his national security adviser's opinion that Hoover was \"a goddamned sewer\", collecting and disseminating dirt. But most presidents have taken pleasure in using the FBI as a sword and a shield to protect and defend their powers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV316AC_YfI\" title=\"Franklin D Roosevelt gave J Edgar Hoover the power\">Franklin D Roosevelt gave J Edgar Hoover the power</a> to eavesdrop, plant hidden microphones, and purloin secrets through burglary. When the Supreme Court outlawed telephone wiretaps, Roosevelt told Hoover, in so many words, to hell with the court. He relished the political intelligence and the unsavoury scuttlebutt that Hoover brought him. He knew that secret agents can be scofflaws; yet their techniques are useful against terrorists.</p> <p>When Hoover ruled the FBI \u2013 as he did for 48 years, until his death in 1972 \u2013 he was confounded by the American electorate only once. After Roosevelt died in office, near the end of the second world war, Hoover, like his fellow Americans, assumed the Republican candidate, Thomas Dewey, would defeat President Truman in November 1948. Dewey, who had made his name as a crime\u2013fighting prosecutor, would have been the first rock-ribbed conservative elected to the White House in 20 years. Hoover was working behind the scenes to support Dewey, who shared Hoover's views on the national emergency confronting the US in the early days of the cold war.</p> <p>The autumn of 1948 was a dangerous moment in American democracy. As the civilian leader in the war on communism, Hoover was no longer obeying the president. \"He wasn't taking orders from Truman or anybody else,\" said Stephen Spingarn, an army counterintelligence officer serving as a White House adviser. Hoover sought sweeping national security powers over law enforcement and intelligence, sufficient to make him a secret police tsar. The White House pushed back. \"That was contrary to our whole tradition,\" Spingarn said. \"You did that in communist and fascist countries, but you don't do that in the United States.\"</p> <p>Hoover wanted to detain thousands of politically suspect American citizens in the event of a crisis with the Soviets. The broad outlines of Soviet espionage in the US were beginning to come clear; Stalin's spies had stolen American atomic secrets. Hoover now drew up plans for the mass detention of political suspects in military stockades: a secret prison system for jailing American citizens, including the suspension of the ancient writ of habeas corpus. Hoover's national security assistant, Mickey Ladd, began working out the details for an American Guant\u00e1namo in October 1948. The FBI and the army would hold the detainees at military bases in and around New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The FBI, the CIA, and army intelligence officers would share the duties of carrying out the thousands upon thousands of interrogations.</p> <p>Truman looked powerless and politically spent as the election approached. Travelling on a long whistle-stop campaign, with the election four weeks away, he caught a glimpse of a Newsweek magazine poll of America's 50 most prominent political reporters. Their unanimous prediction: Dewey defeats Truman. Hoover went to sleep on election night confident in the outcome. But at 11.14am on Wednesday, 3 November 1948, the bulletin went out across the world: Truman had won the biggest upset in the history of the American presidency. A shift of only 33,000 voters in California, Illinois, and Ohio would have given Dewey victory. When Hoover heard the news, he left his desk at FBI headquarters and did not come back for two weeks. He simply disappeared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398289882\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351091990605/John-F-Kennedy-with-J-Edg-008.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy with J Edgar Hoover in 1961\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President John F Kennedy (left) considered FBI chief J Edgar Hoover (right) 'a goddamned sewer'.

He served to ensure the election of Lyndon B Johnson, his long-time Washington neighbour, their friendship bonded over sips of Jack Daniel's and backyard barbecues. Johnson loved secret intelligence; he craved it as he did whisky and cigarettes.</p> <p>After the assassination of President John F Kennedy, both men feared that his brother, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, would seize the fallen mantle. Hoover hated Bobby Kennedy with a passion and ceased to communicate with him. Though the attorney general was his titular superior, Hoover effectively cut off his supply of information and power, ending the possibility that Kennedy could command the Democratic party.</p> <p>Then an FBI intelligence operation in the Deep South provided Johnson with essential political ammunition for his election. Johnson was furiously pushing civil rights legislation that would allow black Americans the right to vote and deny racist senators the ability to block them from the polls. He needed to destroy the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan\" title=\"Ku Klux Klan\">Ku&#xa0;Klux Klan</a>, which was murdering civil rights&#xa0;workers, blowing up black churches, and ruling by fear throughout the South.</p> <p>On 2 July 1964, Johnson ordered Hoover to go to Mississippi and proclaim the omnipotence of the FBI. The director was dubious; he thought the civil rights workers, not the racists, were the primary problem. \"Whatever you do, you're going to be damned,\" Hoover said. \"Can't satisfy both sides.\" Then he got a direct order from the president. \"Ain't nobody going to damn you,\" said Johnson, who was secretly taping the telephone call. \"Ain't anybody in this country has the respect you have.\"</p> <p>Johnson knew how to twist Hoover's arm: \"Now I don't want these Klansmen to open their mouths without your knowing what they're sayin'. Now nobody needs to know it but you, maybe, but we ought to have intelligence on that state \u2026 I want you to have the same kind of intelligence that you have on the communists.\"</p> <p>Johnson was telling Hoover to go after the Klan in language he understood. Hoover obeyed. He would subvert them and sabotage them, so long as Johnson commanded that it be done. The FBI broke the Ku Klux Klan like dry twigs. The civil rights laws were passed, and Johnson won in a landslide, with the votes of millions of white liberals and newly enfranchised black citizens.</p> <p>Days before he left office, Johnson told his successor, Richard M Nixon: \"If it hadn't been for Edgar Hoover, I couldn't carry out my responsibilities as commander-in-chief \u2013 period. Dick, you will come to depend on Edgar. He is a pillar of strength in a city of weak men.\"</p> <p>Hoover had helped Nixon gain power from 1947 onward, feeding him secret intelligence on American communists such as <a href=\"https://files.nyu.edu/th15/public/home.html\" title=\"Alger Hiss\">Alger Hiss</a>. But Hoover died in May 1972, and six weeks later, Nixon's henchmen were arrested breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate hotel. They had burglary tools and a gadget that the police thought was a bomb disguised as a smoke detector: it was a sophisticated electronic eavesdropping device. The suspects had crisp $100 bills and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZUQ6hKmwkI\" title=\"Watergate hotel\">Watergate hotel</a> keys in their pockets. Their ringleaders were Gordon Liddy, a former FBI agent, and Howard Hunt, a former CIA officer. The FBI quickly determined that both men worked for the president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398289883\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351092617991/J-Edgar-Hoover-and-Richar-008.jpg\" alt=\"J Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hoover (right), who helped Richard Nixon (left) gain power, was dead by the time Nixon clashed with the FBI over Watergate.

He recognised Liddy's name; he had met him at the FBI a decade before. When he heard that the burglars had been caught with eavesdropping equipment, he immediately opened a case under the federal wiretapping statutes. At about four in the afternoon, his secretary answered the phone and told him the White House was calling.</p> <p>\"This is Agent Supervisor Dan Bledsoe,\" he said. \"Who am I speaking with?\"</p> <p>\"You are speaking with <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/johnehrlichan.html\" title=\"John Ehrlichman\">John Ehrlichman</a>. Do you know who I am?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. You are the chief of staff there at the White House.\"</p> <p>\"That's right. I have a mandate from the President of the United States,\" Ehrlichman said. \"The FBI is to terminate the investigation of the break-in.\" Bledsoe was silent.</p> <p>\"Did you hear what I said?\" Ehrlichman thundered. \"Are you going to terminate the investigation?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" Bledsoe said.</p> <p>\"Do you know that you are saying 'no' to the President of the United States?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" the FBI agent replied.</p> <p>The FBI investigated the break-in. Nixon's resignation came two summers thereafter.</p> <p>Fast-forward 40 years: the White House, 12 March 2004.</p> <p>The FBI director, Robert Swan Mueller III, who had taken office on 4&#xa0;September 2001, walked into the Oval Office with a handwritten letter of resignation in his breast pocket. He had determined, along with the attorney general, that the electronic-eavesdropping programmes created in great secrecy by President George W Bush after the 9/11 attacks had violated the constitution's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. He would not consent to their use unless the president scaled them back to the boundaries of the law.</p> <p>Mueller told Bush face-to-face that he would resign if the FBI was ordered to continue warrantless searches on Americans. Both men had sworn upon taking office to faithfully execute the laws of the US. Only one still held to his oath.</p> <p>Bush promised to put the programmes on a legal footing. This did not happen overnight. It took years. But he backed down. Mueller has never breathed a word of what happened at the White House. But he is an exemplar of what the FBI must do every day.</p> <p>The man who was then the acting attorney general, James Comey, later described what Mueller had heard from Bush: \"If we don't do this, people will die.\"</p> <p>\"You can all supply your own 'this',\" Comey said. \"'If we don't collect this type of information' or 'If we don't use this technique' or 'If we don't extend this authority.' It is extraordinarily difficult to be the attorney standing in front of the freight train that is the need for this,\" Comey said. \"It takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say 'no' when it matters most. It takes moral character. It takes an ability to see the future. It takes an appreciation of the damage that will flow from an unjustified 'yes'. It takes an understanding that, in the long run, intelligence under law is the only sustainable intelligence in this country.\"</p> <p>The FBI today is still calibrating the balance between liberty and security. Barack Obama, a Democrat grounded in civil liberties, and Mueller, still the civilian commander of domestic security, are two very different men who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-extension-for-robert-mueller-as-fbi-director/2011/05/12/AFdmE8zG_story.html\" title=\"manage to see eye-to-eye\">manage to see eye-to-eye</a>. Mueller, born to wealth and privilege, joined the US Marines and led troops in combat at the height of the war in Vietnam, where he was decorated for valour. Marine officers follow a code: if your troops go up the hill, you go up the hill. Over the past decade, Mueller has led his agents to believe they must fight the threat of terrorism without trampling civil rights. By and large he has succeeded. Mitt Romney and the Republicans have thus far failed to credibly attack Obama's right flank on issues of national security. In this way, the FBI has protected the power of the&#xa0;president.</p> <p>Obama and Mueller have never clashed on any significant issue of counterterrorism or civil liberties. The two men meet most mornings in the White House; unlike the presidencies of Clinton and Jimmy Carter, the discourse is not a dialogue of the deaf. Obama, who never came on to the FBI's radar until he started running for the White House, is intensely attuned to the difference between existential threats and idle chatter; 99% of what US intelligence hears is the latter. Mueller works on the same wavelength; he spent much of his first five years in office after the 9/11 attacks trying to filter out raw intelligence reporting that led the FBI to investigate pizza deliverymen and delusional sociopaths. The focus on analysing actual threats from potential terrorists has reduced the fear factor in daily political discourse, both at the White House and on the 24-hour ravings on the airwaves at Rupert Murdoch's Fox and its affiliates.</p> <p>The balance between national security and civil liberties remains delicate. The authors of the constitution foresaw this struggle 10 generations ago. A free people must have both security and liberty. They are opposing forces, yet we cannot have one without the other. Mueller has said we will not win the war on terrorism if we lose our freedoms in the battle. He knows Americans will surrender guarantees of liberty for promises of security. They may feel more safe, but they will be less free. He&#xa0;lives each day in this state of continual conflict. We all do. No free republic in the history of&#xa0;civilisation has survived for more than 300 years.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Weiner is the author of Enemies: A History of the FBI (Allen Lane, \u00a325/$30), out now.</p>",
  "<p>There was a moment, in the second presidential debate, when President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney circled each other warily, looking like they were about to come to blows. So when they agree on something, it perks up the ears.</p> <p>It turns out that, in the final debate on Monday, they agreed on two things.</p> <p>The first point is that Americans, largely don't care about \u2013 or at least won't vote based on \u2013 foreign policy. That's why both candidates, after some bickering about Syria, Egypt and Libya, hijacked Monday's final presidential debate into the political version of a Thelma and Louise rebellion, careening into domestic policy, education, and other issues more likely to sway the American heart.</p> <p>But before they did, there emerged another, subtler point of agreement: the highlight of American foreign policy right now has been our successful sanctions against Iran, which may be working on developing a nuclear weapon. As each candidate struggled to outdo the other in protestations of the purity of their love for Israel, they knew that the way to Israel's heart was to shut down Iran. Both Obama and Romney were happy to point to evidence that America has done just that.</p> <p>Obama noted, during the debate, that the Iranian rial has dropped in value by 80% and the country's oil production is lower than it has been for two decades. \"So their economy is in a shambles,\" Obama said. Romney agreed that Iranian sanctions have been successful, adding only that he would go even further \u2013 perhaps even to the brink of military action.</p> <p>But have we been smart and powerful enough to bring Iran around to our way of thinking after decades of trying? Has the threat of American financial power been the decisive factor that may have wiped the confident smirk off the face of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad?</p> <p>It's easy to see why it's appealing to think so.&#xa0;In an otherwise bleak year for both foreign policy and the economy, when the US seems to be floating somewhere undefined between a grim recent financial past and a tiresome future of endless sniping about tax policy, the fact that we can exert financial pressure on Iran seems a chance for a well-deserved pat on the back.</p> <p>This summer, the US financial authorities fined major international banks \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-bank-charges-merit-real-penalties-if-proved\">HSBC, Standard Chartered</a> \u2013 for money-laundering, which included, in part, helping Iran evade US financial sanctions. Between the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/07/white-house-insists-iran-sanctions-are-working-130653.html\">presidential chest-beating</a> and the big fines, the message seemed clear: one thing, at least, is going right. America still has its old mojo. The war in Iraq didn't turn out quite right, our influence in Afghanistan may be questionable, and we may remain baffled about what to do about Benghazi and even Egypt, but when it comes to Iran, America has come out like a champ.</p> <p>But, not so fast. As another iteration of President Obama might have said, \"If you have successful Iranian sanctions, you didn't build that.\"</p> <p>We owe, instead, a lot more credit to our beleaguered compatriots who run the European financial system. Iran gave up on the US years ago; America has had sanctions on Iran, in some form or another, since 1979. Getting around that was easy for Iran. Every time US authorities banned one suspicious Iranian entity, another would pop up, as quick as zucchini, and would go on doing business \u2013 most likely, in Europe.</p> <p>Jim Rickards is the author of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2012/03/12/book-review-james-rickards-currency-wars/\">the book Currency Wars</a> and a partner with the hedge fund JAC Capital, as well as an adviser to intelligence agencies on financial and economic issues. Of America's attempts to root out Iranian dictators and particularly Ahmedinejad, he says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We've tried everything: cyberwarfare, financial warfare, psychological operations, assassinations and sabotage. It's not like we haven't been trying. But because the [Ahmedinejad] regime is so brutal, so entrenched, so powerful and so rich, it has not produced the thing everyone wants, which is Iran giving up on its nuclear ambitions. It's very clear diplomacy has failed and Iranians use the promise of negotiations just to buy time.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, why is Iran weakening now \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/world/iran-said-ready-to-talk-to-us-about-nuclear-program.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">as the New York Times reports, seeking talks</a>?</p> <p>Because, since March, the European financial system, which had been adamantly neutral, has turned against Iran. Europe&#xa0;is the base of the core of the global financial system: <a href=\"http://www.swift.com/banks\">Swift, a kind of international instant-message service of banking</a>. Every major financial transaction in Europe has to be chronicled in Swift. When Citigroup has to send, say, $1bn to Deutsche Bank, it doesn't just shovel the money over. Citi sends a message through Swift first.</p> <p>In March, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/world/middleeast/crucial-communication-network-expelling-iranian-banks.html?_r=0\">Swift kicked out 30 Iranian banks</a>, preventing them from doing business in euros. The US also prevented Iran from doing business in dollars. Then, in mid-October, <a href=\"http://hsf-fsrandcorpcrimenotes.com/2012/10/17/eu-strengthens-sanctions-against-iran-with-particular-impact-for-oil-and-gas-sector-and-financial-institutions/\">Europe proposed to penalize any banks doing business on behalf of Iran</a> and proposed penalties on natural-gas exports.</p> <p>After that, it wasn't long before that New York Times report surfaced that Iran was ready to start diplomatic talks with the US. The Obama administration <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/report-on-iran-talks-reverberates-on-sunday-shows/?ref=politics\">denies the report, though the New York Times stands by it</a>.</p> <p>\"Getting [Europe's] commitment to tighten the noose on Iran is really important to help persuade that country,\" said Tony Fratto, of Hamilton Place Strategies, who was an adviser in the Bush administration. \"We haven't had indirect or loose ties with Iran since 1979. Europe has. A lot of Iranians with wealth store their wealth in Europe.\"</p> <p>Unable to do business in either dollars or euros, Iran is in a dangerous political position. A few months ago, Iran started creating multiple exchange rates in its economy, allowing people to get rare dollars more cheaply only if they are importing absolutely essential goods into Iran. So, $1 in America is now worth 12,279 rials \u2013 and that's only if the rials are used to buy essentials like medicine and grain for food. Those who want to buy livestock or minerals pay something closer to 25,500 rials for a single US dollar. The actual exchange rate, which now functions largely in the black market, is closer to 35,000 rials for each American dollar.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1276152--international-sanctions-mean-skyrocketing-prices-for-iranians\">hits both the rich and the poor</a>. Iran is still a country of sophisticated consumers, who like their iPods and their HP printers as much as we do. But those goods are smuggled into the country, and the smugglers accept usually dollars. Simple supermarket trips are becoming a complicated calculus. And as for Iranians in hospitals, or those served by charities, they are suffering for lack of supplies.</p> <p>Overall, the Iranian economy is struggling with sky-high inflation \u2013 as high as nearly 70%, <a href=\"http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article37144.html\">estimates Johns Hopkins economist Steven Hanke</a>. This is exactly what America wants: a regime struggling with a bad economy has much more trouble holding on to power.&#xa0;Hyperinflation is a reliable harbinger of a government that's about to topple. Look at Germany during the Weimar Republic, or China just before the Tiananmen Square riots. Hyperinflation often predates revolutions.</p> <p>Iran threatened Tuesday to stop producing oil, a move that Fratto compared to cinematic farce. \"Iran doesn't even produce their own gasoline; they don't have refineries,\" he pointed out. \"They need to export oil or go bankrupt. I guess they could turn off the spigot for a short while, but it's really suicidal for them to do it. It's like Blazing Saddles when the guy holds the gun up to his own head and says 'Stop or I'll shoot.'\"</p> <p>Iran's bind is a good lesson not in American power, but in America's power when we share it with allies.</p> <p>During and after the financial crisis, what helped stabilize the US and European economies was the fact that the US Federal Reserve worked with the European Central Bank to pour money into the system. The old unilateral model of a single country ruling a financial empire \u2013 even a soft empire \u2013 seems to have passed. To influence the world economy and topple regimes, you need coalitions to move money. And only then can you move the world.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Twigg is right. There is a divide in the education system. But it isn't between the North and South. It's the gap in achievement between rich and poor. A gulf that, despite generations of good intentions, has persisted.<br> Despite Stephen's attempt to play up divisions between North and South, parents, regardless of where they live, mostly want the same things: the choice of a good school place and the confidence their child will be properly equipped to get on in life. Our reforms are doing just that, most notably through the expansion of the <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a0068023/gove-announces-expansion-of-academies-programme\">Academies programme.<br> </a><br>The results of these publicly-funded schools, run by teachers free to innovate to raise standards, speak for themselves. Overall, research shows that sponsored Academies are improving at almost twice the rate of other schools and have been doing so for a decade.</p> <p>Improvements have been particularly impressive in deprived areas and with vulnerable pupils, like those with special needs. Scores of schools in the North, where a third of all secondary schools are Academies, are benefiting.<br> At <a href=\"http://www.dyca.org.uk/\">David Young Community Academy </a>in East Leeds, for example, where over 40 per cent of pupils are eligible for free school meals, the number of pupils getting five or more good GCSEs shot up by 17 per cent between 2010 and 2011.<br> Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.essaacademy.org/\">ESSA Academy in Bolton</a> has doubled the percentage of pupils getting five good GCSEs since becoming an Academy. And in Manchester, <a href=\"http://www.e-actblackleyacademy.org.uk/\">E-ACT Blackley Academy</a>, a primary where roles were falling, is now oversubscribed, with children wanting to turn up in the morning.<br> Everywhere, remarkable turnarounds are being achieved, not by Academies getting extra funding or becoming selective, but because they are being supported by outstanding school leaders and other sponsors to improve, and have more freedom to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398293827\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/5/1317830905591/free-schools-002.jpg\" alt=\"free schools\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Batley Grammar School in West Yorkshire; one of the first batch of free schools.

Again, groups in the North, where there are 16 Free Schools, are seizing this opportunity, with another 27 due to open from next year.<br> We're also helping provide extra school places in Leeds and, indeed, we have doubled the amount of money going into paying for new primary places despite money being short. Schools in the worst condition, including in Liverpool and Manchester, are getting help through the <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schoolscapital/a00209336/priority-school-building-programme\">Priority School Building Programme</a>. In everything we are doing, we are driving for higher standards \u2013 in vocational and technical education as in academic.</p> <p>Whether they're aiming for an apprenticeship, as an estimated 280,000 young people did last year, or for university, we want children to gain the qualifications and skills that employers, colleges and universities value.<br> That's why we're also pressing ahead with many new <a href=\"http://www.utcolleges.org/\">University Technical Colleges</a> and <a href=\"http://www.studioschoolstrust.org/\">Studio Schools</a>.<br> Right across the country brilliant heads and teachers are showing that with high aspiration, children, regardless of background, can achieve excellence. Instead of accentuating division, Stephen Twigg should be more generous in celebrating how individual schools and Academy chains are overcoming it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398293828\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351096382623/Lord_Hill.jpg\" alt=\"lord hill\" width=\"140\" height=\"211\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"https://education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/departmentalinformation/ministerialteam/hill\">Lord Hill of Oareford</a> is Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Schools</em></p> <p><em>You can read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/18/blogpost-stephen-twigg-schools-michael-gove-education\">Stephen Twigg's Northerner post here</a></em>.</p>",

  "<p>A \"powerful paedophile network\" may have had links to a former prime minister, No 10 and parliament, MPs have been told.</p> <p>Tom Watson, Labour MP, told the House of Commons there was \"clear intelligence\" suggesting a notorious group was connected to a former Number 10 aide, during prime minister's questions on Wednesday.</p> <p>He said the police file relating to Peter Righton, who was convicted in 1992 of importing child pornography from Holland, needed to be re-examined.</p> <p>\"The evidence file used to convict Peter Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring,\" Watson added.</p> <p>\"One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister, who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad.</p> <p>\"The leads were not followed up, but if the files still exist, I want to ensure that the Metropolitan police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10.\"</p> <p>David Cameron said he would look at the case \"very carefully and see what the government can do to help\".</p> <p>\"You raise a very difficult and complex case and I'm not sure which former prime minister he is referring to. But what I would like to do is to look very carefully in Hansard as to the allegations you have made, the case that you have raised \u2026 and to see what the government can do to give you the assurances you seek,\" the prime minister added.</p> <p>Watson later expanded on the <a href=\"http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2012/10/a-little-more-background-on-todays-pmqs\" title=\"\">allegations in his personal blog</a>, saying he had been contacted by a former child protection specialist who was concerned that not all of the leads the police had when investigating Righton were followed up.</p> <p>\"The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed that one paedophile in particular was of great concern. He said that the paedophile, who worked with children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold of indecent images of children,\" wrote Watson.</p> <p>\"The central allegation was that a large body of material seized in the raid on Righton's home had not been fully investigated. Though Righton was the subject of a BBC profile The Secret Life of a Paedophile, little had been done to follow up the leads from the case. A specialist unit in Scotland Yard had the material which supplemented a wider investigation into organised paedophile rings in children's homes.\"</p> <p>The Labour MP said he was not naming the aide.</p>",
  "<p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/protest-berlinwall\" title=\"\">1989</a>, eastern Europe was supposed to join the club of so-called \"normal countries\". From now on, we were told, there would be free speech, a free press and free debate, all prevented during the years of communist oppression. But in practice, this free liberal debate is anything but.</p> <p>These days, whenever someone in the post-communist countries of eastern Europe tries to criticise the changes that their country have undergone, the tendency is to ridicule, or worse, silence them. We're all middle class now, we are told. Start your own little enterprises, consume and shut up. Those trying to discuss a solution to the current crisis other than the orthodox austerity measures is quickly dismissed.</p> <p>So when a group of left-leaning editors took over the troubled Polish news weekly <a href=\"http://www.przekroj.pl/\" title=\"\">Przekr\u00f3j</a> (\"Slant\") last winter, it felt like a breath of fresh air in a public sphere usually divided evenly between neoliberalists and nationalists. Yet the change of direction didn't last long. After only a few months, and with the circulation having shrunk by roughly 50%, the editors were sacked and replaced with an editorial team with a track record in entertainment and lifestyle journalism.</p> <p>What Przekr\u00f3j had dared to try and do was initiate a debate about capitalism, in a country where the language of class struggle had supposedly been discredited. It interviewed trade unionists and spoke about strikes and opposition against austerity. They profiled prominent critics of the US and Israel, wrote features on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/12/owen-hatherley-rebel-cities-harvey\" title=\"\">David Harvey's Rebel Cities</a> book, the Occupy movement, Spain's Indignados and last year's English riots. In sharp contrast, the rest of Poland's \"liberal\" establishment has largely turned a blind eye not just to developments abroad, but also those on its own doorstep.</p> <p>For example, when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_%28Polish_trade_union%29\" title=\"\">Solidarity</a> \u2013 one of the unions who played a key role in the 1989 uprisings \u2013 recently protested against the government's raising of the pension threshold from 65 to 67 years, its co-founder Lech Walesa said <a href=\"http://wpolityce.pl/wydarzenia/28645-lech-walesa-palowac-zwiazkowcow-kaczynski-wysylajacy-brata-na-smierc-koncesja-dla-tv-trwam-jako-brzytwa-dla-malpy\">in an interview</a> that he'd have liked to have seen the police face down the demonstrators. Such robust protests were legitimate if directed against a dictatorship, he said, but couldn't be tolerated in a modern democracy.</p> <p>Did the protesters get a fair hearing in the media? One of the protesters complained about the government's lack of empathy with their cause: \"What does he [prime minister Donald Tusk] know about being old and having to work in a coal mine?\" Tellingly, his complaint wasn't found in any of the mainstream liberal outlets, but on <a href=\"http://beyondthetransition.blogspot.co.uk/\">an English-language blog</a>. Class is an issue in modern Poland, but the media refuses to talk about it.</p> <p>This protest, as well as recent strikes of nurses, was a rarity, because in the whole ex-bloc the culture of protest has largely died out with the end of communism. A look at a map of Indignados and Occupy solidarity marches on 15 October 2011 tells you all you need to know: there was almost nothing to the east of the former iron curtain, with only tiny groups in Warsaw, Bucharest and Prague.</p> <p>This is even more surprising since eastern Europe \u2013 the Balkans and Baltic states especially \u2013 has been hit very hard by the crisis. <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/1107/1224307165331.html\" title=\"\">Latvia has experienced economic collapse on the scale of Greece</a>. But there is no Latvian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/19/athens-protests-syntagma-austerity-protests\" title=\"\">Syntagma Square</a> or Syriza party. In Poland, there are currently two kinds of protest: the old Solidarity generation still marches for workers' rights; while post-89 youngsters demonstrate on issues such as freedom of speech \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16735219\" title=\"\">in January thousands protested against the international counterfeiting and piracy agreement Acta</a>. Yet how political that younger generation is remains unclear: what motivated them to take to the street wasn't unemployment or the scaling back of the welfare state, but the fear of free culture being taken from them.</p> <p>All this is taking place in a situation where the state is focused on liberalising employment legislation, tax cuts and privatisation. Leszek Balcerowicz, the economist who adopted the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcerowicz_Plan\" title=\"\">shock therapy</a>\" doctrine in the early 90s, today bemoans the \"swollen public sector\". Nobody investigates the dealings of Atos, who are not only active in Britain but will soon also be taking care of \"benefit reform\" in eastern European countries.</p> <p>One of the reasons Poland has been able to avoid having a wider debate about the flaws of capitalism is that mass emigration, EU subsidies and exports to Germany have been covering up the tolls of the crisis.</p> <p>Under the new editorial management, Przekr\u00f3j's reaction to the jobs crisis has been much like that of the rightwing press in Britain: \"Stop being so lazy and get on your bike!\" Needless to say, the change in editorial direction has been cheered on by the economic liberals that dominate the debate in Poland. Unless the tone of the debate fundamentally changes soon, Poland will be taken completely by surprise when the crisis eventually starts to hit home</p>",
  "<p>Vladimir Kim, chairman of the FTSE 100 mining company Kazakhmys and one of Britain's wealthiest residents, has been accused of giving false evidence to a foreign court during the trial of a former prime minister of Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Kim, who was ranked 32nd in the 2012 Sunday Times rich list with a fortune of \u00a32bn, has been sent a letter from lawyers acting for Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who was prime minister of Kazakhstan from 1994 \u2013 1997, challenging testimony the businessman supplied to a Kazakh court in 2001 when the former politician was convicted in his absence of abuse of office.</p> <p>Kazhegeldin, who lives in exile in London, is now attempting to win compensation in international courts and says that key evidence that convicted him \u2013 including the claims he received a Mercedes Benz and a Toyota for his personal use while still in office \u2013 was falsely provided by Kim.</p> <p>The letter, which has been seen by the Guardian and sent to Kim at his London office and Knightsbridge apartment, said: \"We understand that you knew that your evidence was not true. You gave evidence that you had delivered the cars to Mr Kazhegeldin, but we can prove that this did not happen, nor could it have done so.</p> <p>\"We can well imagine the pressure was brought upon you in order to have you give false evidence. It would assist our client ... if you were to make a statement explaining this pressure and providing full details of your involvement in the whole affair\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Kazakhmys, which will make its third-quarter trading statement on Thursday, said that Kim denied receiving the correspondence. He added: \"These matters have already been extensively dealt with in the press and we have no more to add beyond the evidence given by Mr Kim in court in 2001.\"</p> <p>However, the spokesman could not point to any previous press coverage on the topic and only referred to a <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/library/risky-business-kazakhstan-kazakhmys-plc-and-london-stock-exchange\" title=\"\">report into Kazakhmys published two years ago by the campaign group Global Witness</a>, which detailed Kim's testimony about paying bribes to the former prime minister, as well as Kazhegeldin's denials.</p> <p>The document, though, focused on questioning why investors were not warned at Kazakhmys's flotation that the company's chairman claimed to have been forced to pay bribes in Kazakhstan. It did not mention Kazhegeldin's claims of possessing supporting evidence that could potentially contradict Kim's testimony.</p> <p>The request by Kazhegeldin's lawyers for a statement from Kim, who owns one of London's most luxurious apartments at One Hyde Park, relates to cases they have launched in Malta and Italy against Rakhat Aliyev, a former head of Kazakhstan's committee on national security.</p> <p>Kazhegeldin claims that Aliyez launched a campaign against him while he was prime minister which resulted in his conviction and has caused him financial loss.</p> <p>Aliyev, who was also once Kazakhstan's ambassador to Austria and formerly the son-in-law to President Nursultan Nazarbayev, has himself fled Kazakhstan and is now living in exile in Vienna and Malta. Like Kazhegeldin, he claims to be a victim of a political witch-hunt in his homeland. Aliyev's lawyer did not respond to phone calls and request for comment.</p>",

First, we heard that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/dec/12/popandrock3\" title=\"\">Pull Tiger Tail</a> had transformed into the rather good <a href=\"http://www.fadedglamour.co.uk/2012/09/surfacing-thumpers-new-band.html\" title=\"\">Thumpers</a>. Then we learned that members of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/jul/09/popandrock3\" title=\"\">Palladium</a>, those London-based purveyors of slick jazz-funky 80s-style pop \u2013 who were cruelly dropped by their record company on the eve of the release of their debut album \u2013 were back and making, well, anything but slick jazz-funky 80s-style pop, only this time as Monsta.</p> <p>We remember Palladium's Rufio Sandilands (then on keyboards) and Rocky Morris (drums), music college graduates both, telling us that they used to get muso types coming to their gigs to take notes at the front of the stage, so proficient were they on their chosen instruments. But we had no idea they could apply that proficiency to such a broad range of styles. Some might call it cynical calculation, but we just admire their canny shift into a more commercially potent arena. Because what they're now doing is operating as the in-house production wing of Monsta, a three-piece \u2013 with Skaar on vocals \u2013 managed by the team behind <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/oct/05/new-band-chase-status\" title=\"\">Chase and Status</a>, Sub Focus and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pendulum\" title=\"\">Pendulum</a>, and signed to Owsla, the label run by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/skrillex\" title=\"\">Skrillex</a>.</p> <p>That is some move \u2013 from Level 42ish smooov-boy fusion to whatever term is currently being employed to describe the din made by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/01/new-band-skrillex\" title=\"\">Mr Moore</a>. With Skaar's powerhouse vocals and Rufio and Rocky's machine-tooled beats and samples, Monsta have come up with a brutally efficient brostep soul, or Bass&amp;B. The tracks on their self-titled debut EP suggest what might have happened had Otis Redding beamed forward through time to work with Nero or C&amp;S. Lead track Holdin' On features a very 60s-soul message about the importance of, yes, keeping on keeping on, but it's set in a couldn't-be-more-21st-century screech'n'bass context. Messiah, the second track, also applies soul tropes (\"The rivers are deep and the mountains I climb are so high\", \"I'll testify the truth\", \"I'm down on my knees\", and so forth) to the megawatt intensity of the harsher end of dubstep, complete with drops, breaks and the sound of a crowd chanting at a rave. In its epic bombast and keyboard magnitude, Where Did I Go? joins the dots between bass and prog: think <a href=\"http://www.decibelmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/rick-Wakeman-on-stage-with-cape.jpeg\" title=\"\">Rick Wakeman in his cape-clad pomp</a> DJing at <a href=\"http://www.ilovefwd.com\" title=\"\">FWD&gt;&gt;</a>. <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/monstacloud/monsta-holdin-on-skrillex-and\" title=\"\">There's even a Skrillex remix of Holdin' On</a> that is both utterly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab-mViYje7g\" title=\"\">mentasmic</a> and a bit like a dentist's drill. \"Excuse me while I clean my mind off the walls\" was just one of the more restrained responses from a listener to the track on SoundCloud.

  "<p><strong>Q:</strong> In the inaugural George Bradshaw Address last year, Rick Haythornthwaite said: \"We know that many of the public view the leadership of the industry with confusion, suspicion or disdain. They don't trust us and therefore are resistant to changes we want to make.\" Is there a lack of public support for the rail industry and if so, how serious an impediment is it to the industry's progress?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The points that Rick made last year are very important and what we have done on the Rail Delivery Group, and what I hope to bring out in my speech, is to carry forward the answers to the questions he posed. Given the current state of the industry it is critical that we come together to find the answers. There is an issue of public comprehension of the industry and I hope to develop that theme in my speech, pointing to a complexity in the industry that creates value in many ways but it also creates confusion in the minds of the public. They feel that it is difficult to understand the industry and to do business with it, to access it, to be sure they are getting the best deal. It is incumbent on the industry to overcome that. And that, partly, leads to the perception issue that Rick talked about.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> &#xa0;The west coast franchise process has been cancelled and the award of three more contracts has been postponed. What does this mean for the franchise system going forward and for its credibility?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> If there is a crisis in this industry then it is with regard to this subject. We have to work with the government to make sure that we preserve the benefits of what franchises have given us, while addressing the concerns that have been raised. However, those concerns are in many ways unclear to all of us since the deficiencies outlined by the government are to do with its own deliberations on the west coast main line contract. I</p> <p>don't know if anyone has clarity about what exactly happened. The need to react constructively, and find a new way forward, weighs heavily on FirstGroup in particular, since we were the wronged party who, as the government said, acted entirely in accordance withits instructions. We don't, however, want to exacerbate the problems caused by this decision taken by the department. At FirstGroup we have to find a constructive way forward while at the same time protecting our position.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>&#xa0;As chair of the Rail Delivery Group, in your view how far has the industry come in achieving the reforms outlined by <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/realising-the-potential-of-gb-rail/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sir Roy McNulty's report into realising value in GB rail</a>?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>We have come a very long way in comprehending the reforms outlined byMcNulty. That is important because now we know what is in the realm of the possible, what can be developed and what cannot be counted on.</p> <p>The very large numbers that relate to train utilisation will not be achieved [McNulty said costs could be lowered if trains are used more] because we think there are some basic problems in the analysis. Achieving the numbers outlined by McNulty would require such an extensive change in service patterns that we don't believe there would be sufficient interest.</p> <p>In terms of changes to asset and supply chain management, we believe we can put structures in place that will allow the industry to grasp those savings. However, most of those savings occur in the CP5 period between 2014 and 2019 and achieving them requires the government to make choices. So they have to approve basic structures and incentivise train operating companies, freight operating companies and Network Rail to co-operate with each other.</p> <p>Train operators and freight operators have to see that long-term vision in place in order to feel that they are not giving away some competitive advantage in franchising, in order to get those sums. That's why we have to get franchising back up and running. We will not uncover all the savings that McNulty talked about if we don't recover the franchising programme promptly. We will not be able to get the alliance structures, and other structural changes, that will be critical to creating those savings.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much further does the industry have to go before it can achieve McNulty's vision, as well as \u00a31bn in cost cuts?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The \u00a31bn target is a serious ambition. This will come out in the government's High Level Output Statement, which sets out what it wants from the railway over the next five years. As the industry completes its response to that, which sets out how they are going to deliver the HLOS with the funds available, we run into this \u00a31bn number head-on. While at the RDG we are absolutely confident in the work that we have done and it opens up savings, we are working with the government to make sure that everybody has the sums in the right columns, to avoid double-counting and duplication. There is no way that Network Rail can hit its goals without the full cooperation of the rail operating companies and freight operating companies.</p> <p><strong>Q:&#xa0;</strong>Do you sympathise with passengers who complain that rail fares are too expensive, consistently rise higher than inflation, and are poor value for money?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I do sympathise with passengers. So long as we have fare increases above inflation, people are going to feel aggrieved. But the growth keeps coming. At FirstGroup we find that the growth is coming not from people paying high-profile fares that we see in the media, but from finding value on the network. The industry labours under the fact that the government's policy is to shift the cost from taxpayers to passengers. That transition makes us look like we are going for big rate increases. I don't think that is a fair depiction of what is happening. With the government's recent changes on fare increases [being lower than expected], I hope that perception starts to balance out.</p> <p><strong>Q:&#xa0;</strong>You had a successful career in the rail industry in the United States before coming to the UK, how does rail and public transport in the US compare with over here?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>This speaks to the wider perception of rail among British people. The public transport market in the UK is infinitely superior to the US. The great success in the US has been on the freight side. Passenger services, with the great exception of New York City, have largely been neglected.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>&#xa0;What is the international role model for rail that the UK should follow, and why?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Paradoxically, governments in international markets, and certainly in Europe, are looking to the UK model. So the whole impetus behind the single signalling solution of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rail_Traffic_Management_System\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">the European Rail Traffic Management System</a>, for instance, is an opening of the market and a separation between track and train - like in the UK. One of the reasons why the sovereign rail entities like Deutsche Bahn and SNCF are active in the UK market is that they want experience of it before it spreads through Europe.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>&#xa0;If McNulty says the rail industry is too expensive, and you agree with that, why is it so costly and is it an inherent consequence of the fact that rail has three masters: franchisees, Network Rail and the Department for Transport?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>This is about the structure of the industry and making sure we have a better way of presenting choices to the government about how we spend its money on transport. Since the Strategic Rail Authority went away the government has not had as much assistance in helping it choose how to spend its rail budget. That is a role the Rail Delivery Group is hoping to fill. We will outline to the government the choices that it has. If we as a group continue to cooperate and work together - although the current environment will test that after the West coast mainline decision - then there could be a better way for industry to explain itself, and its costs, to the public.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>The train operators appear to have a bumpy relationship with Network Rail at the best of times. How will the RDG improve that?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Once the RDG is formalised, it will force Network Rail and the train operators to make the whole structure of the industry coherent. We do not want separate bodies, all of whom seem to have a separate piece of the industry. We want them organised into a more unified structure under the RDG, so we don't have an uncoordinated industry representing itself to the government and the public.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>&#xa0;You ran the London Underground for six years and your tenure was widely recognized as a great success. By extension, would a vertically integrated railway be a more successful structure?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> That's a generous depiction. Although I did not always work with a fully integrated underground [due to the failed PPP to upgrade and maintain the network], the integration of track and train had enormous advantages and I would not dispute that. The challenge facing the UK rail industry is a little different though. One of the things that a more diverse industry gives you is innovation and more answers. It is highly unlikely that if you put a monolith like British Rail in control you would have had the innovation that we have seen, that has driven record passenger numbers - one of the biggest increases in rail use modern history. A vertically integrated structure would not address the main challenges facing the British rail industry right now.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Fiorenzo Magni, who has died of an aneurysm aged 91, was a pioneer of modern professional cycling and one of the sport's last links with the golden era of the post-second world war years. Known as the \"Lion of Flanders\" or&#xa0;\"Colossus of Monza\", he was a winner of the Giro d'Italia three times, and the \"third man\" in Italian bike racing in the late 1940s and early 50s alongside the two leading lights of that epoch, Fausto Coppi and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/09/guardianobituaries4\" title=\"\">Gino Bartali</a>.</p> <p>Magni never quite attained the national treasure status of either, partly because lingering controversy over his wartime past meant he was an ambiguous symbol of Italy's rebirth. But he was a gritty performer with outstanding tactical awareness, a&#xa0;poor climber due to his burly physique, but an unmatched descender.</p> <p>He was also more enterprising than most, happy to seek success outside his native land, taking the train to Flanders to compete in the one-day spring classics there. He kitted his bike out with wooden rims and foam-wrapped handlebars to cushion himself against the race route's cobblestones and was rewarded with a hat-trick of victories (1949-51) in the Tour of Flanders, one of&#xa0;the toughest races in the sport, at&#xa0;a&#xa0;time when few champions travelled outside their homelands. He was only the second \"foreign\" winner of the race and remains one of only five men to&#xa0;have won the event three times.</p> <p>His first Giro d'Italia victory, in 1948, was controversial, coming after Coppi withdrew in protest at the way the fans were pushing Magni up the climbs. So&#xa0;too was his forced withdrawal from the Tour de France in 1950, when he was leading the race until the two Italian teams pulled out en masse, again in&#xa0;protest at the behaviour of&#xa0;fans, this time their assaults on Bartali. His&#xa0;1951 and 1955 Giro d'Italia wins were more straightforward, but the true drama came in 1956, when he finished second in the race after breaking his collarbone midway through. Pictures show him in a time trial late in the race biting on a piece of inner-tube tied to his handlebars to help him keep in&#xa0;control. Close to the end of the race, he&#xa0;crashed again, breaking his humerus. He&#xa0;considered finishing the race with the two fractures his greatest win.</p> <p>Magni was responsible for an important development \u2013 the inception of outside sponsorship in cycling. In&#xa0;1954, close to the end of&#xa0;his&#xa0;professional career, cycle makers, who had hitherto been the principal team backers, were feeling the pinch due to&#xa0;the rise of the moped and the car. When the Ganna bike company was unable to give him a deal, Magni approached the Nivea skincare company, was given 20m Italian lire, and&#xa0;had his team. He had to fight hard to get the idea past race organisers, who were worried that team sponsorship would detract from their income, but&#xa0;his innovation has stood the test of&#xa0;time. Most professional teams now have backers from outside the sport.</p> <p>Where today's cyclists are stalked by controversy due to doping, the skeleton in Magni's cupboard was of a different order. After the war, he was accused of collaboration with fascist forces for his part in a roundup of partisans at&#xa0;Valibona in the Apennines. The story goes that as the roundup was taking place, one of the victims \u2013 a cycling fan \u2013 raised his head from the ground to see the face of his idol looking down at him, lit up by the flames of a burning house.</p> <p>Facing 30 years' imprisonment, Magni was released after his fellow cyclist Alfredo Martini testified in his favour. As was often the case in those turbulent years of mixed and divided loyalties, the picture is not as simple as it seems. Other documents indicate that Magni fought with partisans near the northern town of Monza in 1945.</p> <p>Magni opened a motorcycle dealership near Monza well before the end of&#xa0;his racing career, combining racing and running the business, and after that a car dealership, where he could be found well into his 80s, a restless, intense man with passionate memories of the great years, working with the same energy that he had put into his racing career, and fuelled by endless cups of coffee.</p> <p>He remained active in Italian cycling as a national team manager and director of the Italian professional cycling league. He also played a part in the development of the cyclists' chapel at&#xa0;the crest of the climb at Madonna del&#xa0;Ghisallo, near Lake Como.</p> <p>His wife, Liliana, and two daughters survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 Fiorenzo Magni, cyclist and businessman, born 7 December 1920; died 19 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>On April 6, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20120406-mali-tuareg-mnla-junta-independence-azawad\">declared</a> independence from Mali. Announced from France24's Paris studio, this was the peak of the rebellion's media campaign which came a few short months after the start of the uprising in January. </p> <p>At the time, the MNLA seemed to be the credible voice of the rebels and the Tuaregs, and its demands for an independent state seemed for some the only way to end the marginalisation of northern Mali<strong>'</strong>s nomad populations.</p> <p>Then, fault lines began to appear, and two groups \u2013 Ansar Dine and the Movement of Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA) \u2013 emerged. Their goal: to make Mali an Islamic and Sharia law-abiding state. These Islamist groups soon turned out to be the real masters of the north, <a href=\"http://www.polgeonow.com/2012/09/azawad-islamists-mali-map.html\">chasing</a> the secular MNLA out of its last stronghold in Douentza on September 1.</p> <p>Looking back, the MNLA may appear to be largely an efficient communication strategy created by a group of idealist intellectuals based in Paris. This band still sends communiqu\u00e9s <a href=\"http://mnlamov.net/\">claiming</a> the \"autonomy of Azawad\", delicately reframing its message to the latest field developments. But despite its declining relevance in northern Mali, the MNLA is more than that.</p> <p>While the MNLA's military victories have been short-lived, members of the movement still <a href=\"http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/between-islamization-and-secession-the-contest-for-northern-mali\">maintain</a> contact with Mali's mediator, Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, international actors such as the UN and the regional West African grouping ECOWAS, as well as Ansar Dine.</p> <p>Even if the <a href=\"http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/african-mali-intervention-weeks-says-france\">upcoming</a> international military mission does not include their input, they are likely to have a say in the reconstruction of northern Mali. In order to ensure this, the MNLA recently launched an initiative to meet with northern community leaders and increase its presence. Several international actors still believe the MNLA to be credible enough, and a somewhat lesser evil to other groups in the region.</p> <h2>The rise of Ansar Dine</h2> <p>The story of the MNLA's military defeats remains obscure, as admitting causes of defeat appears as painful for the MNLA as it is for the Malian army. Some <a href=\"http://www.ocnus.net/artman2/publish/Dark_Side_4/Rebels-Rebel-Against-Each-Other-In-Mali_printer.shtml\">reports</a> suggest the Islamists had infiltrated the MNLA from the beginning; <a href=\"http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/05/turaeg_rebels_and_al.php\">others</a> claim MNLA fighters were co-opted by Islamists later.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the MNLA remains the sole movement in the Malian conflict strictly defending Tuaregs. The group was <a href=\"http://thinkafricapress.com/mali/causes-uprising-northern-mali-tuareg\">created</a> in late 2011 through the fusion of several smaller movements, and obtained the support of several Tuareg tribal leaders.</p> <p>This is not to say, however, that the MNLA speaks for all Tuaregs. Ansar Dine might have recruited several foreign fighters, but its leader, for example, is a well-known Tuareg nationalist: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j2E5T3FzSZKJ-OhCpfHOdsoA0idA?docId=CNG.479d25a6bbe0d8ec222921f745502da0.1f1\">Iyad ag Ghaly</a>.</p> <p>Ag Ghaly led several uprisings in the 1990s and the 2000s before joining the Malian High Council of Territorial Collectivities and later became a nominated consul in Saudi Arabia from 2007 to 2010. Since 2003, he has also acted as a mediator to help free hostages held by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).</p> <p>During this time, the man described as \"playing all sides of the Tuareg conflict to maximize personal gain\" during the 2008 rebellion on <a href=\"http://leaks.hohesc.us/?view=08BAMAKO824\">leaked</a> US diplomatic cables <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20120612-northern-mali-peace-dealer-or-wrecker-nine-lives-ansar-dine-chief-iyad-ag-ghali\">became</a> a strong Muslim believer, turning his back on his previous reputation for heavy drinking. Ag Ghaly took part in talks with the MNLA before the assault in January, but launched his own Islamist group, Ansar Dine.</p> <p>The support Ansar Dine's chief has garnered can perhaps be explained to an extent by the Tuareg motto: \"Me against my brother, my brother and me against my cousins, and all the family against the others\". In a complex interplay of social forces in northern Mali, allegiances and alliances do not necessarily last. And fluid tribal connections have played an important role in the current dynamic.</p> <p>In 2007, the Ifoghas' tribal chief Intallah ag Attaher was in a car accident that left him paralysed. \"He did not give up his position, which opened possibilities for protracted internal strife between clans internal to the Ifoghas\", Baz Lecocq, a history professor at Ghent University in Belgium, tells Think Africa Press. Two possible successors opposed: His own son Alghabbas, and Iyad ag Ghaly.</p> <p>Now that the MNLA has been militarily defeated, several Ifoghas have joined Ansar Dine out of loyalty, but several also lured by the leader's war chest. These include Alghabbas ag Intallah, whose father is said to officially support the MNLA. And others could also join Colonel El Hadj Ag Gamou, a Tuareg commander in the Malian Army, and Ag Ghaly's enemy. Alliances can swiftly change as they have in the past.</p> <h2>The Tuareg diaspora</h2> <p>According to UNHCR, more than 200,000 Malians have <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43224&amp;Cr=refugees&amp;Cr1=#.UIfUMVGB1Jc\">fled</a> to neighbouring countries, with 300,000 internally displaced. Many of those refugees are Tuaregs who left early in the rebellion, in January and February. Several simply went back to the camps where they fled persecutions during the 1990s and 2000s rebellions.</p> <p>Among Mali's half a million Tuaregs or so \u2013 in Mali and the diaspora \u2013 it remains unclear how <a href=\"http://www.fpif.org/blog/islamist_militias_more_popular_-_or_less_unpopular_-_in_mali_than_native_tuaregs\">popular</a> the MNLA is.</p> <p>\"I have cousins that are rebels in the MNLA. I was scared for the life of my family. In 1991 and 1994, during the rebellion, fellow soldiers have slaughtered Tuaregs\", says Aoud Ag Maiga, who fled to the Djibo refugee camp in Burkina Faso when fighting began.</p> <p>Now, his wife and children are in a refugee camp in Mauritania. Even if he feels Tuaregs are marginalised, he is confused now about the independence project and his support of the MNLA. \"We are not racists. We believe in equality. We could all live in a secular state of law and order\", he says.</p> <p>Further away, Binetou Wallet Mohamed Ali, 18, left the University of Bamako in February, where she was supposed to join the Department of English Studies. \"People started to look at me strangely. I did not want to be the first victim\", she says.</p> <p>\"Mali is my country. This is where I am born. I want to go back and study. I don't care much about politics\", she adds.</p> <p>Around the refugee camps, there is little talk about independence and many are traumatised by the stories of hands being cut off and presumed adulterers being whipped in the name of the Sharia back home.</p> <h2>Marginalised again</h2> <p>An independent Azawad does not seem to be a priority among the Tuareg diaspora: \"We want our cattle. We want our land. We want to stop having problems. And we don't want to be ruled by foreigners\", concludes Radwane Ag Ayouba, an old Tuareg of the camp, angrily. He confesses that he is afraid he will be in the camps for a long time and is certain that the repression against Tuaregs will be terrible once the Malian army recovers northern Mali.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the camp, an MNLA emissary gives a political speech talking of \"us, the people of Azawad\". But later, we see him leaving the refugee camps in his Mercedes while the rest of the people of Azawad line up to get humanitarian aid.</p> <p>This is of course a very limited snapshot. It is difficult to truly gauge how popular the MNLA is among the Tuaregs. The conflict has had harsh consequences on the people, who are now divided, scattered, and even more marginalised.</p> <p>The humanitarian agenda is now focused on freeing northern Mali from the Islamists, but soon enough Tuareg grievances will need to return to the agenda. So far, in spite of its failures, the MNLA remains the only organisation able to speak for them.</p> <p><em>Marc-Andr\u00e9 Boisvert is a freelance journalist and researcher who lives in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and specialises in civilian-military relations in western Africa </em></p>",

  "<p>Ending \"trafficking\" is perhaps the most well-known, well-resourced, well-loved social cause of the 21st century that doesn't require its proponents' agreement on what it even is they wish to end. What is \"trafficking\"? How many people are \"trafficked\"? Look beyond the surface of the fight against trafficking, and you will find misleading statistics and decades of debate over laws and protocols. As for the issue itself, the lack of agreement on how to define \"trafficking\" hasn't slowed campaigners' fight. Rather, defining trafficking has become their fight.</p> <p>Over the last 15 years, anti-trafficking campaigns have ascended to the most visible ranks of feminist, faith and human rights missions, enjoying support from organizations as ideologically unneighborly as women's rights NGO Equality Now and the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation. The dominant contemporary understanding of trafficking took hold only around the turn of the century, driven in significant part by the advocacy of women's rights groups who sought to redefine trafficking specifically as the \"sexual exploitation\" of women and children. Indeed, this is the definition that groups like the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women succeeded in getting written into the <a href=\"http://www.uncjin.org/Documents/Conventions/dcatoc/final_documents_2/convention_%20traff_eng.pdf\">first international laws (pdf)</a> related to trafficking. When many people hear about \"trafficking\", this is the picture that comes to mind, and it is one that women's rights groups \u2013 and, increasingly, evangelical Christian groups like Shared Hope International, International Justice Mission and Love146 \u2013 use explicitly in their campaigning.</p> <p>In fact, it is with the influence of these groups that the issue of trafficking itself began to migrate: from relative obscurity, to sessions at the United Nations, to highways in the United States, where drivers now find anti-trafficking billboards featuring shadowy photographs of young girls, images meant to \"raise awareness\". Using such images in service of ending \"sexual exploitation\" may seem contradictory, as the girls photographed are presented in what would otherwise seem to be a quasi-pornographic setting. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/melissagira/status/244241917905346560\">A billboard I passed by last August on the interstate in Louisiana</a> showed a girl who looked sweaty and wide-eyed \u2013 only, with the words \"'NOT FOR SALE: END HUMAN TRAFFICKING\" stamped in red over her face.</p> <p>But what \u2013 and who \u2013 is being fought in what is pictured here?</p> <p>Accurate statistics on trafficking are difficult to come by, which does not stop some anti-trafficking groups from using them anyway. For instance, Shared Hope International, which is aggressively pursuing anti-trafficking legislation in 41 US states, claims \"<a href=\"http://www.sharedhope.org/WhatWeDo/Prevent/CommunityAwareness/DoyouknowLacy.aspx\">at least 100,000 juveniles are victimized</a>\" each year in the United States, and possibly as many as 300,000 \u2013 a figure that has been cited (<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/23/siu.selling.girl.next.door.judge/index.html?iref=allsearch\">repeatedly</a>) by CNN. In truth, the figure is an estimate from a <a href=\"http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/restes/CSEC_Files/Complete_CSEC_020220.pdf\">University of Pennsylvania report from 2001 (pdf)</a> of how many youth are \"at-risk\" of what its authors call \"commercial sexual exploitation of a child\", based on incidences of youth homelessness. But it was not a <em>count</em> of how many youth are victims of \"trafficking'\", or involved in the sex trade.</p> <p>Prostitution is often conflated with \"trafficking\" in these statistics, in part because the definition of trafficking that has been pushed to prominence refers exclusively to \"sexual exploitation\". In fact, this conflation has found its way into the collection of data: according to a report from the <a href=\"http://www.gaatw.org/\">Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[W]hen statistics on trafficking are available, they usually refer to the number of migrant or domestic sex workers, rather than cases of trafficking.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This purposeful conflation of sex work and trafficking distinguishes the many feminist and faith-based anti-trafficking groups that focus on sex-trafficking from groups that work directly with people who are involved in forced labor of all kinds, whether or not it involves sex work. This schism over who gets to define trafficking is about to come to a head <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-end-prop35-20121010,0,4382854.story\">for California voters in the form of Proposition 35</a>, which, if passed this November, will set higher criminal penalties and fines for those who commit what the authors of the bill define as sex-trafficking, as opposed to labor trafficking. It will also force those convicted of \"trafficking\" to register as sex offenders and submit to lifelong internet monitoring \u2013 whether or not sex or the internet were involved in their case.</p> <p>There is no question that California is home to several industries where, <a href=\"http://freedomnetworkusa.org/what-is-human-trafficking/human-trafficking-basics/\">according to the Freedom Network</a> (whose member organizations employ a human rights-based approach to anti-trafficking work), forced labor is known to occur: agricultural work, restaurant work, construction work, hotel work, garment work and sex work. But what unites the workers in these industries is not \"commercial sexual exploitation\", but the erosion of labor protections and the toughening-up of immigration policies \u2013 which makes many more people vulnerable to coercion and abuse. Cindy Liou, staff attorney at the <a href=\"http://www.apilegaloutreach.org/trafficking.html\">Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach</a>, a Northern California-based project that has worked with hundreds of survivors of human trafficking, is advocating for Californians to vote no on this proposition. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It redefines trafficking in a way that's incorrect, confusing, and terrible. It's highly problematic because it does this at the expense of all trafficking victims \u2013 it ignores labor trafficking victims.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In fact, so-called \"sex-trafficking\" constitutes only a small percentage of all forced labor, <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/Informationresources/ILOPublications/WCMS_181953/lang--en/index.htm\">as estimated by the International Labor Organization</a>. In their 2012 report, the ILO categorizes \"forced sexual exploitation\" as distinct from other kinds of forced labor, which, in some ways, is helpful as not all forced labor involves sex, and in other ways, adds more confusion to the issue (because what distinguishes \"sex-trafficking\" from sexual abuse is its occurrence within a workplace or work relationship). Still, of the nearly 21 million people the ILO estimates are forced laborers, 4.5 million are estimated to be what the ILO calls \"victims of forced sexual exploitation\" \u2013 that is, over three-quarters of the people around the globe estimated to be in forced labor are <em>not</em> involved in \"forced sexual exploitation\". By contrast, the ILO estimates that 2.2 million people worldwide are forced laborers in prisons or in the military \u2013 people whose stories we are quite unlikely to find on a highway billboard.</p> <p>But, as in the furor over \"sex-trafficking\", it would be wrong to let the volume of public outcry stand in for how significant a problem it is \u2013 however that issue is defined or ill-defined. Similarly, the push for \"real numbers\" can also lead us further into the ideological morass that itself defines the trafficking issue. Jo Doezema, a researcher with the Paulo Longo Research Initiative and author of Sex Slaves and Discourse Masters: The Construction of Trafficking, cautions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[E]ven a recognition that disputes over the meaning of trafficking involve politics and ideology does not go far enough: it still leaves intact the idea that trafficking can be defined satisfactorily, if political will, clear thinking, and practicality prevail.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is, there can be no assessment of the severity of \"trafficking\" if we define this issue by a simple and coherent accounting of \"victims\". What's lost in the relentless defining and counting are the complex factors behind what is now almost unquestioningly called \"trafficking\". Most of all, what is lost is any understanding or appreciation of the challenges faced by the millions of people working, struggling and surviving in abusive conditions, whose experiences will never fit on a billboard.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Editor's note: the photo caption originally stated that the ILO survey referred to trafficking victims; in fact, it refers to victims of forced labor, which may include trafficking victims, but it did not specifically attempt to count those.

  "<p>Scores of women who worked at a local authority have won a fight for equal pay in the UK's highest court that lawyers say will have \"serious ramifications\" for employers, and potentially open the way for thousands more claims in other areas, including the City.</p> <p>The supreme court in effect extended the time workers have to bring equal pay compensation claims from six months to six years, which could make such claims \"more lucrative and worthwhile pursuing\", said solicitors.</p> <p>But local government leaders said that it was unlikely other local authorities would see a flood of claims because of the progress councils had made on tackling equal pay issues over the past six years.</p> <p>Around 170 former Birmingham city council employees \u2013 including women who worked as cooks, cleaners and care assistants \u2013 who left their jobs between 2004 and 2008 are demanding compensation. They say the council made payments and provided benefits to men doing the same level of work, but not to them.</p> <p>Their lawyers claimed that the council breached equal pay law. Birmingham council tried to block the claims, arguing that they should have been made in front of employment tribunals, which have a six-month time limit. But the former employees persuaded the court that they could bring claims in the civil courts, where there is a six-year limit.</p> <p>The women had earlier won fights on the issue in the high court and the court of appeal prior to the supreme court decision, which dismissed Birmingham council's challenge to the court of appeal decision. The five-judge panel ruled 3-2 in the claimants' favour.</p> <p>A law firm that represented the women said the decision was historic and had huge implications. \"The judgment effectively extends the time limit for equal pay claims from six months to six years \u2013 the biggest change to equal pay legislation since it was introduced in 1970, with huge implications for thousands of workers,\" said a spokesman for Leigh Day &amp; Co.</p> <p>He added the firm had 1,000 more claims pending in Birmingham and thousands more in other areas which have been waiting for the supreme court decision.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents local authorities, said: \"Today's ruling has implications for all employers. It is unlikely that local government will see a flood of historic claims brought forward. Claimants can only pursue back pay that falls within six years of starting any action and councils have made significant progress on equal pay, with the vast majority of inequality issues in local government remedied more than six years ago.</p> <p>\"It is possible that this case will mean an increase in the number of equal pay claims for employers to respond to through the civil courts, but the employment tribunals will remain the main avenue for claims. Court action is usually more expensive to bring than tribunal claims and the financial risk is greater because the expectation is that the losing side has to pay the winner's costs.\"</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://birminghamnewsroom.com/2012/10/birmingham-v-abdulla-and-others-statement/\" title=\"\">statement, </a>Birmingham city council said: \"The council is reviewing this judgment in detail before considering its options going forward and will be making no further comment at this stage.\"</p> <p>Lisa Mayhew, an employment specialist at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, said: \"Although this case originated in the public sector, today's decision may well have a significant impact on the City, where female employees may now be more willing to bide their time and bring equal pay claims to the high court.</p> <p>\"The supreme court judges decided that the high court does have jurisdiction to hear an equal pay claim when the time limit of six months to bring an equal pay claim in the employment tribunal has already expired.</p> <p>\"This means that equal pay claims could be viewed as more lucrative and worthwhile pursuing by staff \u2013 a worrying prospect for employers.\"</p>",

Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Commons, MPs are debating a Labour motion on energy market reform. <strong>Caroline Flint</strong>, the shadow energy secretary, opened the debate by claiming that the government's energy bill would do nothing to get prices down for consumers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the government are as concerned about energy bills as they claim to be, why is it that their flagship energy bill does absolutely nothing to help people struggling to make ends meet? Over the last two years we've had countless white papers, consultations, updates and even a draft bill, but not once have we seen anything that recognises the need for urgent reform or challenges the prices and practices of the big companies, or lives up to its name and genuinely reforms the energy market.</p> </blockquote> <p>To coincide with the debate, Labour has published <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/uploads/57e4ad64-60c7-31e4-35ce-400ed575ed04.pdf\">its own five-page document on energy policy (pdf).</a> Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A Labour Government would do three things to reform the energy market. We would abolish Ofgem and create a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall. We would require the energy companies to pool the power they generate and to make it available to any retailer, to open up the market and make it more transparent. We would also require energy companies to put all over-75s on their cheapest tariff, which could save as many as 4 million pensioners as much as \u00a3200 a year from their annual energy bills.</p> </blockquote> <p>Consumerism seems to be at the heart of Ed Miliband's politics at the moment and, reading Nick Robinson's cracking new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-From-Downing-Street-Robinson/dp/0593066804\">Live from Downing Street</a> (part lively, incisive potted history of the relationship between politicians and journalists, part colourful memoir of his experience as a broadcaster, including the obligatory \"how Peter Mandelson tried to get me sacked\" anecdote that features in all autobiographical books by contemporary political journalists), I came across an excellent phrase to describe this. It's \"Which? magazine socialism\". Robinson recalls hearing John Cole using the phrase shortly after the 1992 general election, in a private argument with Tony Blair in the On the Record green room after Blair gave an interview about how Labour needed to change. Cole was using the term to disparage the consumer-focused politics that Blair was championing. In retrospect, it does not seem a particularly good definition of Blairism (not least because it contains the word socialism). But if you look at the announcements that Miliband has been making on energy bills, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/29/miliband-attack-ripoff-pension-charges\">on pension fund charges</a>, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/rate-swap-scandal/9623036/Ed-Miliband-to-demand-FSA-acts-faster-on-missold-swaps.html\">on mis-selling by banks,</a> and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/sep/23/labour-aim-rail-energy-prices\"> on rail fares</a>, \"Which? magazine socialism\" sums it up perfectly.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T14:55:50.106Z\">at 3.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087ee6395cb4897f0db5262\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T13:34:28.076Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/audio/2012/oct/24/prime-ministers-questions\">Here's the Guardian audio from PMQs.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5087e32fb5794584b1c13ed8\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:47:49.519Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 David Cameron has rejected a call from the government\u2019s most senior law officer for Britain to obey the European court of human rights ruling saying the blanket ban on prisoner voting should be lifted.</strong> Giving evidence to the Commons justice committee this morning, Grieve said that Britain observed its international legal obligations, that ignoring international law would be a breach of the ministerial code, that ignoring the ruling would be \u201ccostly\u201d because the government would have to pay compensation to prisoners and that flouting the court could lead to Britain being expelled from the Council of Europe. (See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/24/pmqs-prisoner-voting-cameron-miliband-live#block-5087c05fb5794584b1c13eb3\">11.18am.)</a> Grieve also said that there was considerable flexibility as to how the ruling was implemented. But, at PMQs, Cameron said prisoners would not be given the vote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No one should be in any doubt. Prisoners are not getting the vote under this government. I don\u2019t want prisoners to have the vote, and they should not have the vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>However Cameron did not rule out having another vote on the matter to allow parliament to express its view.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it helps by having another vote in Parliament on another resolution to make absolutely clear, to help put the legal position beyond doubt, I am very happy to do that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has announced that the Crown Prosecution Service will review its decision not to charge Jimmy Savile over alleged sexual abuse.</strong> He made the announcement at PMQs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The director of public prosecutions has confirmed that his principal legal adviser will again review the papers from the time when a case was put to the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] for prosecution. The director of public prosecutions specifically is going to consider what more can be done to alert relevant authorities where there are concerns that a prosecution is not taken forward. The government will do everything it can do, other institutions must do what they can do, to make sure that we learn the lesson of this and it can never happen again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has told MPs that Britain\u2019s economic prospects are improving.</strong> In a clear hint that tomorrow\u2019s GDP figures will show Britain is out of recession, Cameron told Ed Miliband: \u201cI can tell him, the good news will keep coming.\u201d Cameron also said that, overall, Britain was on the right track.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is what\u2019s happening in the country; inflation, down; unemployment, down; crime, down; waiting lists, down; borrowing, down.</p> </blockquote> <p>Number 10 later said Cameron\u2019s line about the good news still coming was not a reference to the growth figures, although the prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not deny that Cameron had seen the figures (which are released to key Whitehall figures 24 hours in advance). Miliband used PMQs to mock Cameron over the west coast mainline fiasco, over the energy announcement last week that subsequently had to be clarified and over the resignation of the chief whip. Miliband said the energy policy had \u201ctotally unravelled\u201d and was \u201canother dodgy offer from this prime minister\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has agreed to look into allegations that a paedophile network may have had links to a senior aide a former prime minister.</strong> The Labour MP Tom Watson raised the case during PMQs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The evidence file used to convict Peter Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring. One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister, who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad. The leads were not followed up, but if the files still exist, I want to ensure that the Metropolitan police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10.</p> </blockquote> <p>Watson did not name the senior aide, or the prime minister for whom he worked, and Cameron said he was not sure which prime minister Watson was referring to. But he said he would look at the case carefully and see if he could give Watson the assurances he wanted.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland?INTCMP=SRCH\">the controversy about Alex Salmond\u2019s allegedly lying over legal advice relating to Scottish independence</a> shows that the case for separation \u201ccompletely falls apart\u201d under scrutiny.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has refused to rule out introducing some form of statutory regulation following the publication of the Leveson report.</strong> When the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg asked him to accept that statutory press regulation was incompatible with a free press, Cameron refused. \u201cWhat matters most is that we have a regulatory system in which the public can have confidence,\u201d Cameron said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has said that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the way large multinational companies minimise their tax payments in the UK.</strong> Labour\u2019s Margaret Hodge said that Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starburks were avoiding tax worth nearly \u00a3900m. Cameron agreed this was a problem.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an international problem about how to make sure that companies pay tax in an appropriate way, I\u2019m not happy with the current situation, the HMRC needs to look at it, we need to make sure these companies are investing in our country but we need to make sure they are paying taxes as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/24/jimmy-savile-scandal-culture-secretary\">Maria Miller, the culture secretary, has defended her decision to write to the BBC about its handling of the Jimmy Savile controversy</a>.</strong> \u201cIt was right the government reflect the deep level of concern,\u201d she said today, in a move likely to escalate the row between the government and the BBC over this issue. In a separate development, the Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, a former BBC producer, said the Savile affair could lead to Chris Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, and George Entwistle, the director general, having to resign.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BBC management, over far too many years, has sought to maintain an imperious disdain for criticism and it has become clear that successive directors general have, while happy to criticise others for not answering difficult questions, either turned a blind eye to criminal activities or have not known what has been going on on their own doorstep, which is also culpable.</p> <p>It is as if your favourite and respectable aunt has been revealed to be on the game, and if Lord Patten is not able to grasp that, then I fear that not only the director general but also the chairman of the BBC Trust are going to have to fall on their swords.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 has said that the proposed 6.8% increase in the EU budget approved by MEPs yesterday is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.</strong> Asked about the vote in the European parliament yesterday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe think European budgets need to reflect the context, which is that countries across Europe are having to take some very tough decisions on public spending. I think we look at that proposal from the European parliament and it is just completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Theresa May, the home secretary, has said that the threat to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism has been downgraded from substantial to moderate.</strong> She made the announcement in a written statement to MPs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today the Security Service reduced the threat level to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism from substantial to moderate. This means that a terrorist attack is possible, but not likely. The threat level to the UK from international terrorism remains at substantial, which means that an attack is a strong possibility. The threat level to Northern Ireland from Northern Ireland-related terrorism remains at severe, meaning that an attack is highly likely. Neither of these two levels has changed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has called George Osborne a liar who is not up to the job of being chancellor.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/24/nadine-dorries-george-osborne-is-a-pernicious-influence-on-david-cameron_n_2007992.html?1351070858&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk-politics\"> an interview with the Huffington Post,</a> she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think George Osborne is out of his depth. He might be a politician and a strategist and a political campaigner. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s up to the job of being chancellor.</p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier this year Osborne said, in response to criticism from Dorries, that she had not agreed with anything he had done for the last seven years. Asked about Osborne\u2019s comment, she told the Huffington Post: \u201cOsborne lied when he said that. Osborne and I have worked together for years. We worked together in Oliver Letwin\u2019s office for three years, from 2001, when I wasn\u2019t an MP, and I got to know George Osborne quite well.

Actually what the United Kingdom should do is not specified and it is quite clear that there is a great deal of latitude in respect of what the United Kingdom can do in respect of implementing the Scoppola judgment ...</p> <p>The United Kingdom government is adherent to the convention. The convention is one of our international legal obligations. And successive governments, including this one, have always put a great emphasis on the observance of our international legal obligations. We live in a world where international law matters increasingly ... We do observe international obligations that are imposed on us.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Britain's reputation would suffer if it ignored the ruling.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The issue is whether the United Kingdom wishes to be in breach of its obligations, and what that does reputationally.</p> <p>Inevitably, if we were to be in default of a judgment in the European court of human rights, whilst clearly there would be some people who could put forward logical arguments as to why we should be, equally I have absolutely no doubt that it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said there was considerable flexibility in how the ruling could be implemented.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are numerous ways in which government or parliament might, could, if it wished to, approach the issue of change to the blanket ban, and that that approach need not necessarily be entirely in the direction that we have got to give more convicted prisoners the vote. There is an inbuilt flexibility in the&#xa0;Scoppola judgment which wasn\u2019t really present in [an early judgment from the court in this case].</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say whether there would be a draft bill published on the matter.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that ultimately parliament could decide to ignore the European court if it wanted.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is entirely a matter for parliament ultimately ... to determine what it wants to do. Parliament is sovereign in this area. Nobody can impose a solution on parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said ministers were obliged under the ministerial code to honour their international legal obligations.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But, as I say, the accepted practice is that the United Kingdom observes its international obligations. And that is something that is spelt out in a number of places, including the ministerial code.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected a suggestion from the Tory MP Nick de Bois that nothing would happen to the UK if it ignored the European court.</strong> In theory, the UK could even be thrown out of the Council of Europe, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not in a position to speculate one way or another what the outcome would be if the United Kingdom government and parliament decided not to respond to the&#xa0;Scoppola judgment. What would happen in practice is a matter of speculation ...</p> <p>As to what the end game would be, whether it would mean that the United Kingdom decided to leave the Council of Europe, or be expelled from the Council of Europe, I don\u2019t think I would wish to hazard a guess. But it is at least technically possible that a country that is in breach of its obligations can be removed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that this had only happened once, to Greece in the 1960s, after the military staged a coup.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said ignoring the ruling would be \"costly\" to the government.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s an issue, I think, that has been canvassed previously, that there would be damages claims stacking up against the United Kingdom government in respect of individual prisoners who would claim that their right to vote had been denied them.

They should also point out to ministers that since the division on votes for prisoners was a free vote - the government backed down after indications to the contrary, and some PPSs voted against the proposals - the practice should be repeated in the event of a bill: it would, in any event, be impossible to whip.

  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Distant_Episode\" title=\"\">A Distant Episode</a> follows a similar course to Bowles famous novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780141187778/the-sheltering-sky\" title=\"\">A Sheltering Sky</a>: a naive westerner travels deep into Morocco and ends up drowning. Psychologically too, it goes through the same territory: a loss of bearings, a loss of dignity, a loss of freedom, a loss of pity. But because its shorter than the novel, it seems sharper, and possibly even crueller. I defy you to read it without shuddering.</p> <p>This time the unlucky protagonist is a language professor eager to track down rare dialects, and just as keen to become a friend to the people he patronises with his learning. Of course he comes a cropper \u2013 and of course, it's appalling.</p> <p>His descent is literal as well as metaphorical. We first see him travelling on a bus down from the \"high, flat region \u2026 with two overnight bags full of maps, sun lotions and medicines\". He's having fun, but this being Bowles, there's something not quite right: \"Now facing the flaming sky in the west, and now facing the sharp mountains the car followed the dusty trail down the canyons into air which began to smell of other things besides the endless ozone of the heights: orange blossoms, pepper, sun-baked excrement, burning olive oil, rotten fruit.\" The professor, we are told, enjoys those smells, which of course, makes us wonder about him. So too does an exchange with a man Bowles calls a \"qaouaji\" in a cafe:</p> <blockquote> <p>'Does this cafe still belong to Hassan Ramani?' he asked him in the Moghrebi he had taken four years to learn.</p> <p>The man replied in bad French: 'He is deceased.'</p> </blockquote> <p>In spite of this lack of respect, the professor allows the man to lead him, at night, \"downward\" along a road the professor doesn't know. They pass through more disconcerting smells \u2013 \"the sweet black odor of rotten meat\", \"the odor of human excrement\" \u2013 and on to something that looks like a quarry. Here at the \"edge of the abyss\" the qaouaji leaves the professor: \"He spat, chuckled (or was the professor hysterical?) and strode away quickly.\"</p> <p>Yikes!</p> <p>It's thoroughly unsettling. So too is the experience of watching the professor make the \"steady and steep downward climb\" into the quarry by moonlight. The feeling that something is going to go wrong is unbearable: so painful that it almost comes as a relief when the professor gets to the \"bottom\", is attacked by a dog and then: \"something cold and metallic was pushed brutally against his spine \u2026 a gun.\"</p> <p>Soon, he sees a group of men advancing towards him, dressed in the black clothes of the Reguibat, speaking in a dialect he (exquisite cruelty!) can't understand.</p> <p>What are the Reguibat? Explanation comes when we are shown the know-it-all professor's thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>'The Reguiba is a cloud across the sun.' 'When the Reguiba appears the righteous man turns away.' In how many shops and market places he had heard these maxims uttered banteringly among friends ... 'An opportunity,' he thought quickly, 'of testing the accuracy of such statements.'</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a test too far. The language expert is beaten, knocked out and when he next wakes (crueller still!) his tongue is removed, accompanied by another mocking glimpse into his mind:</p> <p>\"The word 'operation' kept going though his mind; it calmed his terror somewhat as he sank back into darkness.\"</p> <p>And that's when things start to get really bad. To say more would spoil a nasty surprise and a horrible joke. Suffice to say that it's the psychological pain that Bowles inflicts on his character that really matters. It would be easy to characterise this story as a kind of orientalist fantasy: a good westerner is torn apart by the inscrutable cruelty of a desert people. But that's not where its real horror lies. It's not so much that the professor loses his way, as that he chooses to go down such a dangerous path in the first place. Bowles steadily, mercilessly, sadistically strips the professor of dignity and humanity and the result is all the more frightening because we always have the feeling that the poor old professor asks for his degradation. He is a wally. It's not that his assailants are inhuman, it's that the professor is all too human. He's like you and me and everyone else who reads the story, in other words. A Distant Episode strikes close to home, and that's why it will shake your foundations.</p>",
  "<p>Trinity Mirror could face at least two more legal actions over alleged phone hacking, including from a former football manager, according to the lawyer who brought civil claims against the company's newspapers on Monday.</p> <p>They could join <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/daily-mirror-publisher-sued-alleged-phone-hacking\" title=\"\">the four civil actions that have been filed at the high court</a> against Mirror Group Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People. The civil cases are being taken against MGN on the basis of alleged breach of privacy.</p> <p>Mark Lewis, one of the leading lawyers acting for alleged victims of News of the World phone hacking, was contacted by the two new potential claimants after news that the civil cases had been launched against the publisher broke on Monday night.</p> <p>While still at an early stage of being assessed, it is thought that the pair are considered to have \"reasonably good\" grounds for a thorough assessment of potential legal action. There is no guarantee that any of the claims will result in legal action against Trinity Mirror.</p> <p>One is understood to be a businessman who believes that a story based upon his personal activity that ran in one of Trinity Mirror's titles could only have been known about through voicemail interception.</p> <p>The second potential claimant is understood to be a retired football manager, who is not thought to have worked in the Premier League, who believes that his phone may have been hacked in relation to stories about a high-profile former England manager in the 1990s.</p> <p>This occurred before the introduction of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) in 2000, which made the accessing of voicemails illegal.</p> <p>Monday's claims are the first to be made against a UK newspaper group, other than Rupert Murdoch's News International, over phone hacking.</p> <p>The claims were filed by Lewis on behalf of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, the ex-England football manager, former footballer Garry Flitcroft, actor Shobna Gulati, who played Sunita Alahan in Coronation Street and Anita in Dinnerladies, and Abbie Gibson, the former nanny to David and Victoria Beckham's children.</p> <p>The allegation by Eriksson relates to the Daily Mirror when Piers Morgan, now a TV host on CNN in the US, was editor. The claims lodged on behalf of Gulati, Gibson and Flitcroft allege phone hacking at either the Sunday Mirror or the People.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror has always robustly defended itself against allegations of phone hacking at its titles. \"As we have previously stated, all our journalists work within the criminal law and the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct,\" said a spokesman on Monday.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Jimmy Savile was an eccentric British DJ, TV host and a tireless charity worker who was a big media personality in the UK for close to 40 years. When he died, aged 84 in October 2011, the former coal miner was one of Britain\u2019s most well-known personalities, famous for his trademark fat cigar and garish tracksuits.</p> <p>Savile was a Catholic teetotaller who worshipped his mother and was knighted for his charitable work in 1990, the same year he was given a papal knighthood by pope John Paul II. But, unbeknown to most people, Savile was a paedophile, and police believe he used his position to abuse hundreds of children across the UK.</p> <p>A year after Savile\u2019s death, Scotland Yard revealed it had launched an investigation into his involvement in allegations of child sex abuse \u201con an unprecedented scale\u201d.</p> <p>Jim\u2019ll Fix It, Savile\u2019s most famous show, was a ratings hit and a family favourite, broadcast in the Saturday \u201cteatime\u201d slot \u2013 a prestigious spot for British broadcasters\u2019 flagship shows. The programme involved Savile making people\u2019s (usually children\u2019s) dreams come true.</p> <p>The BBC, the UK\u2019s most respected media organisation, is now accused of having, at the very least, turned a blind eye to allegations of Savile\u2019s behaviour \u2013 some of which is said to have occurred on its premises to children Savile had met on his shows. An investigation by the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme was scrapped amid allegations of pressure from senior executives. The BBC said it was dropped because of editorial reasons.</p> <p>Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, the BBC\u2019s governing body, has spoken of a \u201cthe appalling allegations, the cesspit of the Jimmy Savile allegations\u201d. John Simpson, veteran BBC foreign correspondent and one of Britain\u2019s most respected journalists, has called the scandal \u201cthe worst crisis that I can remember in my nearly 50 years at the BBC\u201d. Prime minister David Cameron has said: \u201cThe nation is appalled by the allegations of what Jimmy Savile did, and they seem to get worse by the day.\u201d</p> <h2>The victims</h2> <p>So far 12 victims are believed to have come forward and are considering legal action against the BBC and others. Scotland Yard has said Savile may have been at the centre of a network of paedophiles who targeted more than 200 victims. Police are investigating whether he had accomplices: former pop star and convicted paedophile Gary Glitter is alleged to have raped a 13-year-old girl in a BBC dressing room.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/11/jimmy-savile-sex-abuse-claims\">According to reports</a>, Savile abused sick and disabled children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Berkshire, a hospital that was the beneficiary of millions of pounds raised by Savile, and where he boasted he had his own bedroom. The hospital has said it has \u201cno record\u201d of complaints about him.</p> <h2>The BBC</h2> <p>The British Broadcasting Corporation is an organisation as central to life in the UK as the National Health Service. While it is not in the strict sense a state broadcaster, it is funded by a compulsory \u00a3145.50 ($231.79) TV license. While the broadcaster is held in so much affection that its nickname is \u201cAuntie\u201d, it is also an object of fierce criticism from media rivals who argue that the TV levy has given the BBC an unfair commercial advantage.</p> <p>The Savile scandal has prompted a fierce debate about the culture of the BBC, an institution run by \u201ccontrol freaks and cowards\u201d according to the newspaper columnist Max Hastings.</p> <p>Criticism is just as strong within the BBC. Reporters on Newsnight, the BBC\u2019s flagship and often hard-hitting current affairs show, have said they believe their editor, Peter Rippon, was under pressure from BBC bosses to drop an investigation into the allegations. Rippon wrote a blog post about the dropping of the show that contained a number of inaccuracies and has been described as a \u201cmatter of regret and embarrassment\u201d by BBC director general George Entwistle. A rival BBC show, Panorama, this week broadcast a film that detailed the tensions within the BBC over the Newsnight report.</p> <h2>What now?</h2> <p>The British police and the BBC are now conducting formal investigations into the allegations. Under questioning from members of parliament, Entwistle was accused of \u201can extraordinary lack of curiosity\u201d when first told about Newsnight\u2019s Savile investigation. Entwistle was not directly responsible for Newsnight at the time but he did have responsibility for BBC1, which was planning a Savile tribute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398308463\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/17/1345203790511/Mark-Thompson-To-Leave-BB-004.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Thompson To Leave BBC In Autumn 2012\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Thompson, the outgoing director general of the BBC, claimed for a return flight to New York in February that cost more than \u00a33,000.

Thompson has said he is prepared to be questioned by MPs but that he was \u201cnever formally notified\u201d about Newsnight\u2019s Savile investigation. In a blogpost, the New York Times\u2019 public editor Margaret Sullivan <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/times-must-aggressively-cover-mark-thompsons-role-in-bbcs-troubles/\">said the Times must not \u201cpull its punches\u201d</a> covering the story. \u201cHis integrity and decision-making are bound to affect the Times and its journalism \u2013 profoundly. It\u2019s worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC has some \u201cvery big questions\u201d to answer, according to John Whittingdale, the chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee in the British parliament</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron appeared to foreshadow Britain coming out of recession on Thursday when he told MPs at prime minister's questions that the good news on the economy was going to keep on coming.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is due to publish the preliminary GDP figures for the third quarter on Thursday, and they are widely expected to show the economy is growing, ending the double-dip recession.</p> <p>Cameron will have been on the ONS pre-distribution list, but his officials said he was not referring to the growth figures when he said good news was coming.</p> <p>Labour is preparing to say a return to growth is good news, but there are underlying deep-seated problems in the British economy that need resolution. Even 1% growth would only put the economy back to the size it was a year ago, Labour will point out.</p> <p>Cameron highlighted the \"good news\" on the economy during exchanges with the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, accusing Miliband of having nothing to offer but \"rubbish jokes\".</p> <p>Cameron pointed out inflation was down, unemployment down and crime down. Pointing to the Labour frontbench, he said: \"Every bit of good news sends that team into decline, but I can tell him the good news is going to keep coming.\"</p> <p>He added Miliband was not up to the job, prompting Miliband to claim Cameron was living in a parallel universe.</p> <p>Miliband had started the exchanges by pressing Cameron to explain what he had meant a week ago when he promised to put energy consumers on the lowest possible tariff.</p> <p>Cameron said he stood by his remarks and that reforms would be set out in the energy bill. He added: \"There is a real problem with 400 tariffs that emerged to be completely baffling for consumer.\" He added: \"We need to go further, we need to use the law.\"</p> <p>Miliband replied that \"the only people who were baffled last week were [Cameron's] energy ministers\", who were unable to understand the prime minister's pledge. He said Cameron had offered a gilt-edged guarantee last week, but the small print had unravelled, amounting to \"another dodgy offer from this prime minister\". He concluded: \"He does not do detail. He made up the policy and he got caught out.\"</p> <p>Miliband tried to build up an impression of government incompetence by referring to reports that train companies had raised concerns over the handling of the west coast mainline franchise in May 2011.</p> <p>He challenged Cameron to say whether any of his recent transport secretaries had been informed of the complaints of the train companies, adding that a failure to act would end up costing the government as much as \u00a3100m. He pointed out that successive Conservative transport secretaries had assured parliament the bidding process was robust.</p> <p>Referring to the episode in which the chancellor, George Osborne, insisted he travel first-class to London from his constituency last week, Miliband said: \"It's not the ticket that needs upgrading; it is the chancellor of the exchequer.\"</p> <p>Cameron pointed out that he had set up an independent inquiry into the franchise process.</p> <p>The two leaders then traded insults over the cost of energy bills, with Miliband claiming that Conservative research department figures showed that the average dual fuel bill fell by \u00a3110 during his period as energy secretary, while it had risen by \u00a3200 under the coalition government.</p> <p>Cameron hit back, saying Miliband as energy secretary did not stand up to the vested interests, but stuffed their pockets with cash.</p>",

Well, with this in mind we've asked author Tim Lott to answer your novel-writing questions in a live webchat this <strong>Friday 26 October, taking place here between 12-1pm (BST)</strong>.</p> <p>This is the first in a series of four webchats we'll host on Friday lunchtimes, aimed at helping you with your fiction writing. To keep the chats focused, each will be around a particular topic covered in the how-to guides.

For example, corkboards and index cards? Or the writing programme Scrivener? (This question is somewhat redundant if you don't outline...)</p> <p>Do you write in linear order, or bunny-hop around writing scenes out of order as the fancy takes you?</p> <p>What is your approach to redrafting an outline once that first pass is complete. On a related note, what would you say novice writers' greatest mistakes are when facing fixing first-draft thinking?</p> <p>When you first have an idea for a new novel, do you consciously seek out other books that are somewhat similar? Whether to look for strategies that have worked, or to avoid retreading ground already 'owned' in a classic?</p> <p>How do you typically find your way into an idea? Do you start from character, theme, scraps of story... or haphazardly?</p> <p>Finally, given your pliable surname, what have been your favourite Lott-based puns over the years?</p> <p>Thanks again!</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19088150\">timlott56</a> replies:</h2> <p>No i don't use either physical aids or software other than Freedom which forces me to go offline. I used to use index cards to organise characters/scenes, but now I log them in files on my computer.</p> <p>i write in linear order.</p> <p>I never write outlines.</p> <p>A novelists greatest mistake is to try and write the whole book in 20,000 words . In other words, rushing.</p> <p>No I don't seek out other books. No ground is owned by any other novel.</p> <p>I invariably start with a theme. For instance 'White City Blue' started with 'The Polltics of Friendship' whereas 'Rumours of a Hurricane' started with' a ground floor view of the 1980s.'</p> <p>Not a Lott!</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19047296\">Xanthe</a> asks:</h2> <p>I have written three novels and the third came close to being accepted. How can I get the detailed advice that I now need in order to become publishable without spending large sums of money that I don't have on long courses and editorial feedback. I am beyond the easy stuff, advice like show don't tell, read your dialogue aloud, etc and I am beginning to wonder if I am banging my head against a brick wall trying to do something which I will never be quite good enough at. I have a blog and I write short stories, poems. reviews and descriptive pieces for that.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19088237\">timlott56</a> replies:</h2> <p>I would either submit your work to the Literary Consultancy or to a mentoring agency like Jill Dawson's Gold Dust course http://www.jilldawson.co.uk/mentoring.html . Writers - like me - sometimes do mentoring, but they are not cheap.</p> <p>I don't know what to say about banging your head against a brick wall.

Even the best novels are imperfect, and furthermore, they are a matter of personal taste.

  "<p>A young activist from the same area of Pakistan as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, the girl shot in the head by a Taliban gunman this month, has been warned in a threatening phone call that she will be next.</p> <p>Hinna Khan, a 17-year-old from Swat, was named during a call made to her mother's mobile phone two days after Malala, who spoke out against the Taliban, was attacked as she sat in a van with her classmates, in the town of Mingora.</p> <p>Hinna's father, Reyatullah Khan, said: \"The Taliban have kidnapped me and tortured me in the past for promoting women's development, but now they are threatening the entire family.\"</p> <p>Khan has long publicly opposed the Taliban and in 2008 he gathered a \"jirga\" of locals to denounce the extremists for forcing schools to close down in Swat. Since 1999 he and his wife have worked through their own organisation to promote development and literacy programmes that support women.</p> <p>Although he has received threats for many years, he is now taking them far more seriously in the wake of the attack on Malala, who is now recovering in hospital in the UK.</p> <p>Two weeks before the attempt to kill the 14-year-old, Khan discovered someone had painted a red cross on the gate of the family house in Islamabad, where they have lived since fleeing Swat in 2007.</p> <p>\"I removed it but someone just repainted it,\" he said. \"Then after Malala was attacked we received telephone calls threatening that 'your daughter is next,' and 'we have already sent people to Islamabad to target her.'\"</p> <p>The caller said the family were guilty of having \"forgotten your culture\". Ever since, the family have been restricting their movements and rarely venture out of the house.</p> <p>The Taliban \u2013 which have issued no public warning against the Khans \u2013 justified their attempt to kill Malala because she had campaigned for \"secular\" rule, rather than the form of government based on the movement's interpretation of Islamic law.</p> <p>Hinna has also been involved herself in her parent's work, organising demonstrations in Islamabad in 2008 calling for peace in Swat. At the time the valley was struggling to cope with a rising Taliban insurgency, later crushed by a major military operation mounted by the Pakistani army. The insurgents also took over the Khans' house in Swat, turning it into a Taliban \"office\" in early 2009.</p> <p>Reyatullah Khan said he had not received any help, despite appealing to the country's interior minister for protection. He said he was so concerned that he was thinking of joining relatives in Afghanistan \u2013 a substantially more dangerous place than the leafy suburban streets of Islamabad.</p> <p>\"I will appeal to [the Afghan president] Hamid Karzai because in Pakistan the ministers and government are not sincere,\" he said. \"In Afghanistan, the government is at least sincere to its people.\"</p> <p>Those Pakistanis who most oppose the Taliban have been disappointed that the attempted murder of Malala has not prompted another military crackdown against the Taliban, particularly in their sanctuaries in the tribal agency of north Waziristan.</p> <p>The US has long demanded such a move, and some commentators believe Pakistan's army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, has been anxious to mount a major operation before the onset of winter.

  "<p>When the new Trinity Mirror chief executive, Simon Fox, decided to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/15/trinity-mirror-national-regional-divisions\"> merge the company's national and regional newspapers into a single division</a>, I thought it was entirely the wrong strategy.</p> <p>There is no national-regional synergy. They are two very different kinds of enterprise and therefore require separate approaches.</p> <p>It may be possible to set long-term objectives for regional daily and local weekly titles even during this period of persistent sales decline and advertising retreat.</p> <p>National titles, by contrast, face a set of commercial problems due to intense competition. This often necessitates rapid decision-making, sometimes within a 24-hour period.</p> <p>Moreover, national papers are continually buffeted by a series of unforeseen events. And within a week of Fox making his move so it has come to pass.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/22/daily-mirror-publisher-sued-alleged-phone-hacking\">facing four civil claims over alleged phone hacking </a>at all three of its London-based titles - the Daily and Sunday Mirror and The People.</p> <p>The immediate result was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/23/phone-hacking-allegations-trinity-mirror-shares\">a plunge in the company's price</a>. And that was compounded within a day by nervousness among some of its big shareholders who are now calling for an inquiry.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af20d4fa-1d1e-11e2-abeb-00144feabdc0.html\">According to the Financial Times,</a> one top-five shareholder believes an independent inquiry would be an \"appropriate\" step while a top-20 shareholder is quoted as saying: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We need as much information as possible on this. An inquiry would be a good thing as that would clear up any concerns about further scandals.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So Fox now finds himself dealing with an unwelcome legacy from his predecessor, Sly Bailey. When the hacking scandal broke, she refused to institute an inquiry into the papers' past activities.</p> <p>Instead, she chose to stage a futile \"review\" into current editorial controls and procedures, which was conducted by Paul Vickers, the company's legal director.</p> <p>I am sure, knowing Vickers, that he did this scrupulously. But his finding, that the papers were squeaky clean, was a foregone conclusion. The fact that they were adhering to the law and the editors' code of practice \u2013 was totally unsurprising.</p> <p>Years on from two News of the World people going to jail for the interception of voicemail messages, the Mirror group journalists would have been mad to have been at it.</p> <p>But Bailey and her board were aware of allegations that hacking had occurred at Mirror titles in previous years. They knew that the former Daily Mirror editor, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/oct/24/piersmorgan-daily-mirror\">Piers Morgan, had boasted several times of his own working knowledge of such dark arts</a>.</p> <p>During the Leveson inquiry, they also learned from a former Mirror journalist, James Hipwell, that he <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-21-December-2011.txt\">had witnessed Mirror journalists hacking into the voicemail messages of celebrities.</a></p> <p>Similarly, on a related matter involving intrusions into privacy, the Bailey board was aware that 45 Daily Mirror journalists were identified by the information commissioner in 2006 as having been involved in the commissioning of potentially unlawful transactions by a private investigator, Steve Whittamore.</p> <p>The figures were astonishing: the Daily Mirror was involved in 681 transactions, while the People's journalists used his services 805 times and the Sunday Mirror on 143 occasions. </p> <p>Yet Trinity Mirror, confronted with Morgan's boasts, Hipwell's evidence and the dispassionate report by the Information Commissioner about snooping (see <a href=\"http://www.ico.gov.uk//~/media/documents/library/Corporate/Research_and_reports/WHAT_PRICE_PRIVACY_NOW.pdf\"><em>What price privacy now?</em></a>), averted its gaze.</p> <p>Instead, it allowed a time bomb to tick away. And <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/exclusive-was-the-mirror-group-hackingphones-before-news-of-the-world-8223470.html\">a sensational report in the Independent today</a> suggests it could be about to go off. Here's the opening paragraph:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Scotland Yard are holding evidence that a senior Mirror Group executive regularly paid a private investigations firm up to \u00a3125 a time for mobile phone numbers and private pin access codes at least two years before phone hacking became a routine practice at the News of the World.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The paper reveals that it has seen \"invoices for the service\" and knows the identity of the former Mirror employee who, its explains, \"cannot be identified for legal reasons.\"</p> <p>It claims the journalist added to Hipwell's account by saying staff were bullied into hacking, that it was common knowledge and that voicemail interceptions took place from the 1990s to well into the 2000s.</p> <p>According to the Indy's source, the practice \"started off as a cult activity by showbiz reporters\" and later \"the news people started to use it \u2026 It became standard practice.\"</p> <p>Bailey was asked <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-16-January-2012.txt\">during her appearance at the Leveson inquiry</a> why she had not ordered an investigation into the rumours of hacking by her journalists.</p> <p>She replied: \"There was no evidence and we saw no reason to investigate \u2026 We have only seen unsubstantiated allegations and I have seen no evidence to show me that phone hacking has ever taken place at Trinity Mirror.\"</p> <p>David Barr, the Leveson inquiry counsel, was baffled, asking her why she didn't think an investigation was required.</p> <p>She said: \"I don't think it's the way to run a healthy organisation \u2026 to go around conducting investigations when there is no evidence.\"</p> <p>What was unhealthy was the refusal to look back into history by seeing whether there was any truth to the rumours and allegations, though it must be said that Trinity Mirror has always robustly defended itself against phone hacking.</p> <p>Now it is her successor, Fox, who finds himself at bay. With four claims against the company, shareholders getting twitchy and the clear implication that Scotland Yard is circling, surely he cannot take the Bailey line any longer. </p> <p>Fox would also do well to recall what Sue Akers, the Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-23-July-20121.txt\">told the Leveson inquiry in July.</a> Trinity Mirror's newspapers were, she said, a focus of officers' suspicions over payments to public officials.</p>",

Prisoners are not getting the vote under this government.\" He pointed out that in February last year the House called by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 for the blanket ban to be maintained rather than fall in line with the ECHR judgment.</p> <p>Cameron's aides said afterwards he was still considering the government's options, including a draft bill introducing limited prisoner voting rights to comply with the ECHR, despite fierce opposition from Eurosceptic backbenchers.</p> <p>They added that the prime minister was suggesting a further vote in the Commons if it helped to clarify the legal position. Cameron avoided saying whether he was willing to be thrown out of the Council of Europe, the body that oversees the ECHR.</p> <p>Embarrassed ministers are likely to defer the hugely controversial announcement until just before a late-November deadline, allowing it to be made after the police commissioner elections on 17 November.</p> <p>One government source said: \"No party wants to put this in their 'last-week grid' for these elections. The final decision will be made very late.\"</p> <p>The announcement is still causing friction, with one coalition source saying most of the dispute was now \"a blue-on-blue row\" within the Conservative party.</p> <p>Cameron has said in the past it would make him sick to give prisoners the right to vote, but he allowed the then Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper to propose that prisoners serving a sentence of four years or less should be allowed to vote.</p> <p>Harder-line Tory backbenchers, such as Dominic Raab, have argued there is practically no danger of a fine from the European court should Britain not introduce votes for prisoners, and absolutely no chance of the UK being kicked out of the Council of Europe.</p> <p>But Grieve has told ministers they have to accept the ruling of the human rights court after repeated appeals have failed. Grieve has been a supporter of reform of the court, but not UK withdrawal, saying that would make Britain a pariah state.</p> <p>On Wednesday, he told MPs on the justice committee: \"The United Kingdom government is adherent to the convention. The convention is one of our international legal obligations. And successive governments, including this one, have always put a great emphasis on the observance of our international legal obligations. We live in a world where international law matters increasingly \u2026 We do observe international obligations that are imposed on us.\"</p> <p>Grieve said Britain's international reputation would suffer if the ruling was ignored and that it could be costly in terms of compensation claims stacking up against the government. \"I have absolutely no doubt it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws,\" he said.</p> <p>He refused to say if a draft bill would be produced on the matter, but said there was considerable flexibility on how the ruling could be implemented.</p> <p>He said that ultimately parliament could chose to ignore the ruling. \"It is entirely a matter for parliament ultimately \u2026 to determine what it wants to do,\" he said. \"Parliament is sovereign in this area. Nobody can impose a solution on parliament.\"</p> <p>Conservative MPs took to Twitter to express their opposition to any concessions on prisoner voting rights. Zac Goldsmith tweeted: \"MPs almost unanimously rejected votes for prisoners. If it happens all the same, does that mean the UK Parl officially no longer matters?\" Nick de Bois and Douglas Carswell indicated that they and many other backbenchers would vote against the plan.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat ministers still support compliance with the ECHR, but do not want to be seen any longer to be in the vanguard on an issue that is likely to make them deeply unpopular. Labour does not favour prisoner voting rights but does not want to be seen to be ignoring the court.</p> <p>The political advantage of agreeing to publish a draft bill is that the government would not be seen to be in open defiance of the court in that it would be taking steps with the court order to introduce legislation on prisoners' rights.</p> <p>Yet, in practice, a draft bill might take years to reach the statute book, since it would require wide consultation and allow amendment by a joint committee of both houses. The two alternatives are to table a fresh Commons motion, or to publish a bill.</p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, accused the government of creating another confusing shambles. He said: \"The Tory-led government's sheer confusion this morning over whether prisoners will or won't get the vote is yet another illustration of the ridiculously shambolic way they are running our country.</p> <p>\"The public will be rightly concerned at reports prisoners could get a vote. If true, thousands of those serving sentences for serious and violent crimes such as wounding, assault and domestic violence would be given a say in who runs the country. Instead of the chaos of leaks and spin we've seen this morning, the public deserve the truth about the government's intentions.\"</p>",
  "<p>At first glance, Maurice Lim Miller's formula for fighting poverty sounds disconcertingly simple \u2013 if not downright utopian. Give people on low incomes a financial incentive to work together and they will build strong local networks that help lift them out of poverty. A plain speaker who is pleasingly devoid of professional jargon, Lim Miller says his approach is common sense. \"You have to let families deal with [the problem] in their own way.\"</p> <p>As chief executive and driving force behind the <a href=\"http://www.fiinet.org/\" title=\"\">Family Independence Initiative</a> (FII), an anti-poverty, not-for-profit organisation based in Oakland, California, the former youth worker has been assiduously rewriting the rulebook on combating entrenched poverty. He has been garnering considerable attention in the process from policymakers and the media, which was fuelled further when he was awarded a coveted <a href=\"http://www.macfdn.org/fellows/871/\" title=\"\">MacArthur \"genius\" fellowship</a> this month. And with the latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/us-census-figures-children-poverty\" title=\"\">figures </a>showing that one in five children in the US live in poverty, he stands to attract even more interest in the months ahead.</p> <p>In a nutshell, Lim Miller explains, FII challenges the conventional notion of \"needs-based\" poverty interventions and the stereotype that low-income families are not capable and rely on outside guidance. To this end, the organisation recruits small groups of struggling low-income families in poorer communities (they must know one another already) and incentivises them to work together to improve their circumstances. Regardless of any state benefits they receive, each family is given a computer and a modest stipend \u2013 no more than $500 (\u00a3312) per quarter \u2013 in return for documenting and reporting any progress they make by working with the other families.</p> <p>These small steps, says Lim Miller, can be anything from learning leadership skills to increasing savings, to pooling resources for childcare so that parents can get out to work. But whatever form it takes, the point is that there are no professionals on the ground stipulating what their goals should be, or instructing on how to reach them.</p> <p><strong>Dependency</strong></p> <p>The idea, Lim Miller stresses, is that low-income households are steered away from dependency on welfare programmes, which, he says, \"no matter how well meaning are disempowering\". It is taken for granted that the families \"will spend the money much more efficiently\", he adds, if it is simply handed over and left up to them. He says the guiding principle is that people from poor backgrounds are neither the \"victims\" they are often portrayed as by people on the left, or \"lazy\" and undeserving as they are frequently labelled by the right. \"Just like anyone else, these families want some control and choice in their lives.\"</p> <p>The project, which Lim Miller acknowledges was a bold experiment when it launched with a small cohort of families in Oakland almost a decade ago, has grown steadily. There are now more than 350 families participating in Boston, San Francisco and Oakland with further expansion planned, including an online social networking hub. \"In the first two years [of the project] in Oakland, incomes jumped among the group by 27%. Savings were up by 300%. Nine out of the 23 families had bought homes,\" he says. The latest data from the initiative shows considerable progress in San Francisco and Boston with average incomes up.</p> <p>Lim Miller talks too of a \"ripple effect\" within communities. \"People can see that somebody achieved something \u2026 Expectations change.\" The perception people have of their life chances is critical, he argues. \"If you are in a community where no one is getting ahead, what does that do [to you]?\"</p> <p>The participants are not families in crisis but those trying to get a foot on the social mobility ladder. \"I've been working with low-income families for over 20 years. These are families who are trying, who want to get out [of&#xa0;poverty] but are stuck,\" he explains.</p> <p>Lim Miller speaks eloquently about how his background as the son of an impoverished immigrant Mexican mother propelled him to find new ways to tackle the cycle of extreme poverty. \"This approach is very personal. My mom was a single mom who was determined for me to get out of poverty for good. Pride was important to her,\" he says. However, FII was also born of professional frustration. \"I came into [FII] from doing non-profit work. When I saw the kids of the people I worked with, when I started out, coming [to services for help], I&#xa0;thought: 'Whatever we are doing, it isn't working'. I began to question why.\"</p> <p>Just as Lim Miller was beginning to probe into why anti-poverty strategies had failed for so long, he was asked in 1999 by the then mayor of Oakland and current governor of California, Jerry Brown, to come up with alternative ways to channel money already set aside to tackle poverty. Brown asked Lim Miller why, when so many social workers and professionals were being employed to run schemes to help poor people, the problem remained so intractable. \"Jerry said to me: 'Doesn't this seem like poverty pimping to you?'\" When he went back to Brown with the idea to give money directly to poor families to see what they did with it, the mayor took an unexpected leap of faith and FII was born.</p> <p>Lim Miller's work has been recognised at the highest levels and his input is being sought by thinktanks including the rightwing <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org\" title=\"\">Heritage Foundation</a>.</p> <p>In 2010, he was appointed to President Obama's White House Council for Community Solutions, an advisory board exploring fresh approaches to mobilising people to work together on addressing community problems. In 1999, even before FII was up and running, Miller was honoured by the then president Bill Clinton at the state of the union address for his youth, race relations and poverty work. A string of other awards has also been lavished on him.</p> <p>Yet, for all the accolades, Lim Miller is clearly a pragmatist. The recognition means nothing more than an opportunity to bolster FII's work. Cuts to social services have ensured that spare cash is in short supply \u2013 although it is doubtful state money would be forthcoming even without cuts. In his experience, officials are not amenable to an unorthodox project that deliberately does not prescribe its outcomes. Some funding has been secured from private foundations, but many remain reticent for similar reasons to government.</p> <p>Lim Miller suggests that, despite such obstacles, a combination of factors has coalesced to mean attitudes to tackling poverty might be shifting. Among these is the evidence of FII's success and that the most severe recession since the 1930s has hurled a multitude of families into poverty. Important also, he says, has been the growing awareness of the widening wealth gap between rich and poor and the decline of social mobility.</p> <p>So, does he think his approach might translate to Britain or to other countries? He says one of \"the most important lessons\" he learned when the project moved beyond Oakland was that cultural, ethnic and local differences may exist, but the very fact that families set their own goals makes the programme uniquely adaptable. \"People in Britain concerned about poverty in the future need to look at the social context,\" he says. \"Lifting people above a poverty line is not enough. People must have a stake. There has to be something tangible in the long term. That's what gives people hope.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae<br></h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 66.</p> <p><strong>Lives </strong>Oakland, California.</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Divorced with two children.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> CK McClatchy high school, California; University of California, Berkeley, engineering BSc and design&#xa0;MAUniversity of California at Berkeley; Development Training Institute, certificate in community developmentDevelopment Training Institute.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> 2001-present: founder/CEO, Family Independence Initiative; 1981-2000: executive director, Asian Neighbourhood Design; 1978-81: programme director of Asian Neighbourhood Design; 1972-78: student at UC Berkeley; 1968-72: Union Carbide, plant engineer; 1969-71 drafted, US Army Signal Corps (sent to Vietnam).</p> <p><strong>Awards</strong> 1997 Eureka fellow; 2010 Whitehouse Council for Community Solutions; 2011 Ashoka fellow; 2012 MacArthur fellow.</p> <p><strong>Interests </strong>Learning salsa and playing the guitar.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II - Update III)</strong></p> <p>A primary reason for opposing the acquisition of abusive powers and civil liberties erosions is that they virtually always become permanent, vested not only in current leaders one may love and trust but also future officials who seem more menacing and less benign. </p> <p>The Washington Post has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html\">crucial and disturbing story</a> this morning by Greg Miller about the concerted efforts by the Obama administration to fully institutionalize \u2013 to make officially permanent \u2013 the most extremist powers it has exercised in the name of the war on terror. </p> <p>Based on interviews with \"current and former officials from the White House and the Pentagon, as well as intelligence and counterterrorism agencies\", Miller reports that as \"the United States' conventional wars are winding down\", the Obama administration \"expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years\" (the \"capture\" part of that list is little more than symbolic, as the US focus is <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/14/chomsky_on_obama/\">overwhelmingly on the \"kill\" part</a>). Specifically, \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade.\" As Miller puts it: \"That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.\"</p> <p>In pursuit of this goal, \"White House counterterrorism adviser John O Brennan is seeking to codify the administration's approach to generating capture/kill lists, part of a broader effort to guide future administrations through the counterterrorism processes that Obama has embraced.\" All of this, writes Miller, demonstrates \"the extent to which Obama has institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent war.\" </p> <p>The Post article cites numerous recent developments reflecting this Obama effort, including the fact that \"CIA Director David H Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of the agency's fleet of armed drones\", which \"reflects the agency's transformation into a paramilitary force, and makes clear that it does not intend to dismantle its drone program and return to its pre-September 11 focus on gathering intelligence.\" The article also describes rapid expansion of commando operations by the US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and, perhaps most disturbingly, the creation of a permanent bureaucratic infrastructure to allow the president to assassinate at will:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"JSOC also has established a secret targeting center across the Potomac River from Washington, current and former U.S. officials said. The elite command's targeting cells have traditionally been located near the front lines of its missions, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. But JSOC created a 'national capital region' task force that is a 15-minute commute from the White House so it could be more directly involved in deliberations about al-Qaeda lists.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The creepiest aspect of this development is the christening of a new Orwellian euphemism for due-process-free presidential assassinations: \"disposition matrix\". Writes Miller:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Over the past two years, the Obama administration has been secretly developing a new blueprint for pursuing terrorists, a next-generation targeting list called the 'disposition matrix'.</p> <p>\"The matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine operations. US officials said the database is designed to go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the 'disposition' of suspects beyond the reach of American drones.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The \"disposition matrix\" has been developed and will be overseen by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). One of its purposes is \"to augment\" the \"separate but overlapping kill lists\" maintained by the CIA and the Pentagon: to serve, in other words, as the centralized clearinghouse for determining who will be executed without due process based upon how one fits into the executive branch's \"matrix\". As Miller describes it, it is \"a single, continually evolving database\" which includes \"biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations\" as well as \"strategies for taking targets down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrols\". This analytical system that determines people's \"disposition\" will undoubtedly be kept completely secret; Marcy Wheeler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/260906328980086786\">sardonically said</a> that she was \"looking forward to the government's arguments explaining why it won't release the disposition matrix to ACLU under FOIA\".</p> <p>This was all motivated by Obama's refusal to arrest or detain terrorist suspects, and his resulting commitment simply to killing them at will (his will). Miller quotes \"a former US counterterrorism official involved in developing the matrix\" as explaining the impetus behind the program this way: \"We had a disposition problem.\"</p> <p>The central role played by the NCTC in determining who should be killed \u2013 \"It is the keeper of the criteria,\" says one official to the Post \u2013 is, by itself, rather odious. As Kade Crockford of the ACLU of Massachusetts <a href=\"http://privacysos.org/node/857\">noted in response to this story</a>, the ACLU <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/biggest-new-spying-program-youve-probably-never-heard\">has long warned</a> that the real purpose of the NCTC \u2013 despite its nominal focus on terrorism - is the \"massive, secretive data collection and mining of trillions of points of data about most people in the United States\". </p> <p>In particular, the NCTC operates a gigantic data-mining operation, in which all sorts of information about innocent Americans is systematically monitored, stored, and analyzed. This includes \"records from law enforcement investigations, health information, employment history, travel and student records\" \u2013 \"literally anything the government collects would be fair game\". In other words, the NCTC - now vested with the power to determine the proper \"disposition\" of terrorist suspects - is the same agency that is at the center of the ubiquitous, unaccountable surveillance state aimed at American citizens.</p> <p>Worse still, as the ACLU's legislative counsel Chris Calabrese documented back in July <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/biggest-new-spying-program-youve-probably-never-heard\">in a must-read analysis</a>, Obama officials very recently abolished safeguards on how this information can be used. Whereas the agency, during the Bush years, was barred from storing non-terrorist-related information about innocent Americans for more than 180 days \u2013 a limit which \"meant that NCTC was dissuaded from collecting large databases filled with information on innocent Americans\" \u2013 it is now free to do so. Obama officials eliminated this constraint by authorizing the NCTC \"to collect and 'continually assess' information on innocent Americans for up to five years\". </p> <p>And, as usual, this agency engages in these incredibly powerful and invasive processes with virtually no democratic accountability:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"All of this is happening with very little oversight. Controls over the NCTC are mostly internal to the DNI's office, and important oversight bodies such as Congress and the President's Intelligence Oversight Board aren't notified even of 'significant' failures to comply with the Guidelines. Fundamental legal protections are being sidestepped. For example, under the new guidelines, Privacy Act notices (legal requirements to describe how databases are used) must be completed by the agency that collected the information. This is in spite of the fact that those agencies have no idea what NCTC is actually doing with the information once it collects it.</p> <p>\"All of this amounts to a reboot of the Total Information Awareness Program that Americans rejected so vigorously right after 9/11.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It doesn't require any conspiracy theorizing to see what's happening here. Indeed, it takes extreme naivet\u00e9, or wilful blindness, not to see it.</p> <p>What has been created here - permanently institutionalized - is a highly secretive executive branch agency that simultaneously engages in two functions: (1) it collects and analyzes massive amounts of surveillance data about all Americans without any judicial review let alone search warrants, and (2) creates and implements a \"matrix\" that determines the \"disposition\" of suspects, up to and including execution, without a whiff of due process or oversight. It is simultaneously a surveillance state and a secretive, unaccountable judicial body that analyzes who you are and then decrees what should be done with you, how you should be \"disposed\" of, beyond the reach of any minimal accountability or transparency. </p> <p>The Post's Miller recognizes the watershed moment this represents: \"The creation of the matrix and the institutionalization of kill/capture lists reflect a shift that is as psychological as it is strategic.\" As he explains, extra-judicial assassination was once deemed so extremist that very extensive deliberations were required before Bill Clinton could target even Osama bin Laden for death by lobbing cruise missiles in East Africa. But:</p> <blockquote> <p>Targeted killing is now so routine that the Obama administration has spent much of the past year codifying and streamlining the processes that sustain it.</p> </blockquote> <p>To understand the Obama legacy, please re-read that sentence. As Murtaza Hussain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MazMHussain/status/260898386000089091\">put it</a> when reacting to the Post story: \"The US agonized over the targeted killing Bin Laden at Tarnak Farms in 1998; now it kills people it barely suspects of anything on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>The pragmatic inanity of the mentality driving this is self-evident: as I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/klein-drones-morning-joe\">discussed yesterday</a> (and many other times), continuous killing does not eliminate violence aimed at the US but rather guarantees its permanent expansion. As a result, wrote Miller, \"officials said no clear end is in sight\" when it comes to the war against \"terrorists\" because, said one official, \"we can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us\" but trying is \"a necessary part of what we do\". Of course, the more the US kills and kills and kills, the more people there are who \"want to harm us\". That's the logic that has resulted in a permanent war on terror.</p> <p>But even more significant is the truly radical vision of government in which this is all grounded. The core guarantee of western justice since the Magna Carta was codified in the US by the <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am5.html\">fifth amendment to the constitution</a>: \"No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" You simply cannot have a free society, a worthwhile political system, without that guarantee, that constraint on the ultimate abusive state power, being honored.</p> <p>And yet what the Post is describing, what we have had for years, is a system of government that \u2013 without hyperbole \u2013 is the very antithesis of that liberty. It is literally impossible to imagine a more violent repudiation of the basic blueprint of the republic than the development of a secretive, totally unaccountable executive branch agency that simultaneously collects information about all citizens and then applies a \"disposition matrix\" to determine what punishment should be meted out. This is classic political dystopia brought to reality (despite how compelled such a conclusion is by these indisputable facts, many Americans will view such a claim as an exaggeration, paranoia, or worse because of <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/believing-oppression-only-happens.html\">this psychological dynamic I described here</a> which leads many good passive westerners to believe that true oppression, by definition, is something that happens only elsewhere).</p> <p>In response to the Post story, Chris Hayes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/260908192643575810\">asked</a>: \"If you have a 'kill list', but the list keeps growing, are you succeeding?\" The answer all depends upon what the objective is.</p> <p>As the Founders all recognized, nothing vests elites with power \u2013 and profit \u2013 more than a state of war. That is why there were supposed to be substantial barriers to having them start and continue - the need for a Congressional declaration, the <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html\">constitutional bar</a> on funding the military for more than two years at a time, the prohibition on standing armies, etc. Here is how John Jay <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed04.asp\">put it in Federalist No 4</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In sum, there are factions in many governments that crave a state of endless war because that is when power is least constrained and profit most abundant. What the Post is reporting is yet another significant step toward that state, and it is undoubtedly driven, at least on the part of some, by a self-interested desire to ensure the continuation of endless war and the powers and benefits it vests. So to answer Hayes' question: the endless expansion of a kill list and the unaccountable, always-expanding powers needed to implement it does indeed represent a great success for many. Read what John Jay wrote in the above passage to see why that is, and why few, if any, political developments should be regarded as more pernicious.</p> <h2>Detention policies</h2> <p>Assuming the Post's estimates are correct \u2013 that \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade\" \u2013 this means that the war on terror will last for more than 20 years, far longer than any other American war. This is what has always made the rationale for indefinite detention \u2013 that it is permissible to detain people without due process until the \"end of hostilities\" \u2013 so warped in this context. Those who are advocating that are endorsing nothing less than life imprisonment - permanent incarceration \u2013 without any charges or opportunities to contest the accusations.</p> <p>That people are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/guantanamo-prisoner-death-democrats\">now dying at Guantanamo</a> after almost a decade in a cage with no charges highlights just how repressive that power is. Extend that mentality to secret, due-process-free assassinations \u2013 something the US government clearly intends to convert into a permanent fixture of American political life \u2013 and it is not difficult to see just how truly extremist and anti-democratic \"war on terror\" proponents in both political parties have become.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>As I noted yesterday, Afghan officials <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-afghanistan-taliban-idUSBRE89M0N120121023\">reported that</a> three Afghan children were killed on Saturday by NATO operations. Today, <a href=\"http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/24/3-killed-kids-hurt-as-fury-grows-over-u-s-drone-strikes-in-pakistan/\">reports CNN</a>, \"missiles blew up part of a compound Wednesday in northwest Pakistan, killing three people - including one woman\" and added: \"the latest suspected U.S. drone strike also injured two children.\" Meanwhile, former Obama press secretary and current campaign adviser Robert Gibbs <a href=\"http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2012/10/23/obama-adviser-robert-gibbs-blames-denver-teens-terrorist-father-for-his-drone-death/\">this week justified</a> the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-airstrike-that-killed-american-teen-in-yemen-raises-legal-ethical-questions/2011/10/20/gIQAdvUY7L_story.html\">US killing of 16-year-old American Abdulrahaman Awlaki</a>, killed by a US drone in Yemen two weeks after his father was, on the ground that he \"should have a far more responsible father\".</p> <p>Also yesterday, <a href=\"http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/23/al-qaeda-figure-comes-back-to-life-in-yemen/\">CNN profiled</a> Abu Sufyan Said al-Shihri, alleged to be a top al-Qaida official in Yemen. He pointed out \"that U.S. drone strikes are helping al-Qaida in Yemen because of the number of civilian deaths they cause.\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-yemen-us-airstrikes-breed-anger-and-sympathy-for-al-qaeda/2012/05/29/gJQAUmKI0U_story.html\">Ample evidence</a> supports his observation.</p> <p>To summarize all this: the US does not interfere in the Muslim world and maintain an endless war on terror because of the terrorist threat. It has a terrorist threat because of its interference in the Muslim world and its endless war on terror.</p> <h2>UPDATE II</h2> <p>The Council on Foreign Relations' Micah Zenko, writing today about the Post article, <a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2012/10/24/institutionalizing-americas-targeted-killing-program/\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Recently, I spoke to a military official with extensive and wide-ranging experience in the special operations world, and who has had direct exposure to the targeted killing program. To emphasize how easy targeted killings by special operations forces or drones has become, this official flicked his hand back over and over, stating: 'It really is like swatting flies. We can do it forever easily and you feel nothing. But how often do you really think about killing a fly?'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is disturbingly consistent with <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-rise-of-the-killer-drones-how-america-goes-to-war-in-secret-20120416?print=true\">prior reports</a> that the military's term for drone victims is \"bug splat\". This - this warped power and the accompanying dehumanizing mindset - is what is being institutionalized as a permanent fixture in American political life by the current president.</p> <h2>UPDATE III</h2> <p>At Wired, Spencer Ackerman reacts to the Post article with <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/disposition-matrix/\">an analysis</a> entitled \"President Romney Can Thank Obama for His Permanent Robotic Death List\". Here is his concluding paragraph:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Obama did not run for president to preside over the codification of a global war fought in secret. But that's his legacy. . . . Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign Relations writes that Obama's predecessors in the Bush administration 'were actually much more conscious and thoughtful about the long-term implications of targeted killings', because they feared the political consequences that might come when the U.S. embraces something at least superficially similar to assassination. Whoever follows Obama in the Oval Office can thank him for proving those consequences don't meaningfully exist \u2014 as he or she reviews the backlog of names on the Disposition Matrix.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's worth devoting a moment to letting that sink in.</p>",
  "<p>Minor offences by children should be treated as a public health issue and not as crimes, according to a new report revealing failings in the justice system have cost 190 lives in a decade.</p> <p>The report says that the failings are \"systemic\" and that children and young people sent to jail are often the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.</p> <p>The report has been produced by the Prison Reform Trust and the group <a href=\"http://www.inquest.org.uk/\" title=\"\">INQUEST</a>, which campaigns for measures to cut deaths in custody.</p> <p>A decade ago the death of 16-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/nov/12/law\" title=\"\">Joseph Scholes</a> in a young offender institution exposed failings, with an official panel saying he should have been placed in secure council care after being convicted of stealing mobile phones.</p> <p>The expert panel concluded in an internal Prison Service report that Joseph's problems had been so great the institution could not provide the care he needed. He had a history of mental problems, triggered by sexual abuse.</p> <p>The new report says in the decade since Joseph's death, nine children and 188 youths under the age of 24 have died in prisons or secure training centres.</p> <p>The report concludes: \"The custody threshold should be raised to ensure imprisonment becomes a true last resort, and is reserved for the minority of children and young people who commit serious violent offences and who pose a significant risk to others. Prison should not be the default response to low-level persistent offending.</p> <p>\"Minor offences and anti-social behaviour committed by children and young people should be viewed as a public health, rather than criminal justice, issue and diverted to the health, welfare and other agencies which are best-placed to address them.\"</p> <p>In a foreword to the report, the former chief inspector of prisons Lord Ramsbotham said poor management was to blame: \"This system and services in the community, whose failures are described in the report, have demonstrably let young people down, for all the wrong reasons, for far too long.</p> <p>\"As poor and inconsistent management, manifested in the failure to implement lessons learned, is behind most of the findings, I hope that a system is developed that holds named managers to account for overseeing policy implementation and improving practice.\"</p> <p>The report examined in detail the cases of 98 children and young people who died, and concluded they were \"some of the most disadvantaged in society\" and had experienced problems with mental health, self-harm, alcohol and drugs.</p> <p>Their cases saw communication failures between community agencies and prisons while, in others, they were placed in prisons with unsafe environments and cells, the report said.</p> <p>Yvonne Bailey, the mother of Joseph, said: \"It is now over a decade since my son Joseph died in fear and distress hanging from the window bars of his squalid cell in a children's prison,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The deaths of a further nine young boys are devastating evidence that the changes implemented were yet again wholly insufficient to fulfil the duty on the state to protect the right to life of the children it imprisons.</p> <p>\"I am saddened and perplexed by the continuing and repeated refusal of successive governments to properly investigate through a public inquiry the circumstances that have led to the deaths of child prisoners.\"</p> <p>Calls for a public inquiry after the death of Joseph were rejected by the then Labour government.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \"Every death in custody is a tragedy for families and friends and has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners.</p> <p>\"The rate of self-inflicted deaths has fallen by approximately 40% since 2004, but we are committed to further reducing the numbers of deaths in custody.\"</p>",
  "<p>Well done, Sir Roger Carr \u2013 president of the CBI and chair of Centrica. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/responsible-capitalism-businesses-reputation\" title=\"\">Writing on this website on 19 October</a>, he laid out the agenda facing corporate boards and C-suites in the UK. \"All businesses,\" he argued, \"are increasingly judged not just on how much money they make, but how they make money; business behaviours and business performance are increasingly inseparable.\"</p> <p>Not that you'd guess it from the behaviours of some leading companies. \"In the last 12 months,\" Sir Roger noted, \"malpractice in the media and the disreputable activities of the banks, have continued to poison the general public's view of business \u2013 and particularly big business.\"</p> <p>His welcome conclusion: \"Bad behaviour must be stamped out by self discipline in our boardrooms, not only to avoid the onerous burden of further red tape and damaging taxation through government intervention, but also so that we can attract diverse, talented people into our organisations.\"</p> <p>All this resonated powerfully because we are working on the next phase of our evolving <a href=\"http://www.breakthroughcapitalism.com/\" title=\"\">Breakthrough Capitalism programme</a> \u2013 which aims to pin down what we should be asking not only of UK boards and C-suites but also of their international counterparts in what we dub the Global C-suite.</p> <p>The nature and scale of that task was brought home recently when Bloomberg carried a blog <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-11/top-1-000-companies-wield-power-reserved-for-nations.html\" title=\"\">by Bob Eccles, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, and George Serafeim</a>, assistant professor of business administration at HBS.</p> <p>Their conclusion: \"Globalisation has concentrated economic power within a group of large companies who are now able to change the world at a scale historically reserved for nations. Just 1,000 businesses are responsible for half of the total market value of the world's more than 60,000 publicly traded companies. They virtually control the global economy. This vast concentration of influence should be the starting point for any strategy of institutional change toward a sustainable society.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, it turns out that there's substantial concentration even within the top 1000. Just 83 companies now account for a third of the Global 1000's $32tn in revenue, Eccles and Serafeim report, while the top 172 companies account for about half of it. The 172nd&#xa0;largest corporation, the Russian oil company Rosneft Oil, had revenue equivalent to the GDP of the 74th&#xa0;largest country, Uruguay.</p> <p>The wider demographic and environmental evidence, meanwhile, suggests that we are headed in unsustainable directions, with the Global C-suite distracted by the downturn and other factors. In this context, Sir Roger's self-discipline and voluntary initiatives can only take us so far. We must change the rules within which capitalism operates \u2013 indeed the very rules of capitalism.</p> <p>True, as Eccles and Serafeim accept, many companies now see they have some responsibility to the world beyond company operations. \"They know that if they are to continue such rapid growth in developing markets \u2013 or, as Willie Sutton might say, 'where the money is' \u2013 they might need to bring in more than goods and services, such as civil-society upgrades where they're most needed: housing, health and education,\" they write. Now that's an idea: multinational corporations helping build civil society institutions that will help keep their own activities in check.</p> <p>All this will require revolutions in our institutions, economics and accounting practices. One of the more interesting blogs was <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-thinking-in-economics-by-andrew-sheng-and-geng-xiao\" title=\"\">posted in October by Andrew Sheng and Xiao Geng of the Fung Global Institute</a>, based in Hong Kong, which highlighted that economics tends to focus on the micro and macro levels, whereas two others levels are of growing concern: the meso and the meta.</p> <p>\"Meso-economics studies the institutional aspects of the economy that are not captured by micro or macroeconomics,\" say Sheng and Geng. \"By presupposing perfect competition, complete information, and zero transaction costs, neoclassical economics assumes away the need for institutions like courts, parties, and religions to deal with the economic problems that people, firms, and countries face.\"</p> <p>And meta-economics? This approach \"goes still further, by studying deeper functional aspects of the economy, understood as a complex, interactive, and holistic living system. It asks questions like why an economy is more competitive and sustainable than others, how and why institutions' governance structures evolve, and how China developed four global-scale supply chains in manufacturing, infrastructure, finance, and government services within such a short period of time.\"</p> <p>The add on our inner Darwin that: \"In order to study the deep hidden principles behind human behaviour, meta-economics requires us to adopt an open-minded, systemic, and evolutionary approach, and to recognise the real economy as a complex living system within other systems. This is difficult, because official statistics mismeasure \u2013 or simply miss \u2013 many of the real economy's hidden rules and practices.\"</p> <p>Clearly, then, we have meso and meta-level challenges that we can't address solely by switching on particular boards and C-suites. Still, converting key elements of the Global C-Suite can be a critical first step. Happily, whatever the intentions may have been, the market trends Eccles and Serafeim explore have already gone a fair way towards making the global economy more adaptable by concentrating market and (potentially) moral leadership into 1,000 boardrooms and/or C-suites.</p> <p>But, as they conclude, ultimately every individual must show responsible behaviour, which can be helped by institutions. So we'll gladly take the best that self-discipline and voluntarism have to offer, Sir Roger, but look forward to hearing how Centrica, the CBI and eventually the Global C-suite plan to embrace the meso and meta dimensions to good effect.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and a non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The attorney general has said Britain should abide by a European court of human rights (ECHR) ruling on prisoner voting as it emerged the government is planning a draft bill introducing limited rights for inmates, despite fierce opposition from Conservative backbenchers.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, answering questions at the Commons justice committee on Wednesday, warned it was technically possible the UK could be thrown out of the Council of Europe if it ignored the Strasbourg court's ruling.</p> <p>Embarrassed government ministers are likely to defer the hugely controversial announcement until just before a late-November deadline, allowing it to be made after the police commissioner elections on 17 November.</p> <p>One government source said: \"No party wants to put this in their 'last-week grid' for these elections. The final decision will be made very late.\"</p> <p>The announcement is still causing friction, with one coalition source saying most of the dispute was now \"a blue-on-blue row\", within the Conservative party.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to comment directly on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/tories-bow-to-europe-prisoner-voting-rights\" title=\"\">the Guardian story about plans for the draft bill</a>. A spokesman said: \"If people go to prison they lose the right to vote. That's our policy.\"</p> <p>David Cameron has said it would make him sick to give prisoners the right to vote, but he allowed the then-Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper to propose that prisoners serving a sentence of four years or less should be given the right.</p> <p>Harder-line Tory backbenchers, such as Dominic Raab, have argued there is practically no danger of a fine from the European court should Britain not introduce votes for prisoners, and absolutely no chance of the UK being kicked out of the Council of Europe.</p> <p>But Grieve has told ministers they have to accept the ruling of the human rights court after repeated appeals have failed. Grieve has been a supporter of reform of the court, but not UK withdrawal, saying that would make Britain a pariah state.</p> <p>On Wednesday he told MPs on the justice committee: \"The United Kingdom government is adherent to the convention. The convention is one of our international legal obligations. And successive governments, including this one, have always put a great emphasis on the observance of our international legal obligations. We live in a world where international law matters increasingly \u2026 We do observe international obligations that are imposed on us.\"</p> <p>He said Britain's international reputation would suffer if the ruling was ignored and that it could be costly in terms of compensation claims stacking up against the government. \"I have absolutely no doubt it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws,\" he said.</p> <p>He refused to say if a draft bill would be produced on the matter, but said there was considerable flexibility on how the ruling could be implemented.</p> <p>He said that ultimately parliament could chose to ignore the ruling. \"It is entirely a matter for parliament ultimately \u2026 to determine what it wants to do,\" he said. \"Parliament is sovereign in this area. Nobody can impose a solution on parliament.\"</p> <p>Conservative MPs took to Twitter to express their opposition to any concessions on prisoner voting rights. Zac Goldsmith tweeted: \"MPs almost unanimously rejected votes for prisoners. If it happens all the same, does that mean the UK Parl officially no longer matters?\" Nick de Bois and Douglas Carswell indicated that they and many other backbenchers would vote against the plan.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat ministers still support compliance with the ECHR, but no longer want to be seen to be in the vanguard on an issue that is likely to make them deeply unpopular. Labour does not favour prisoner voting rights but does not want to be seen to be ignoring the court.</p> <p>The political advantage of agreeing to publish a draft bill is that the government would not be seen to be in open defiance of the court in that it would be taking steps with the court order to introduce legislation on prisoners' rights.</p> <p>Yet, in practice, a draft bill might take years to reach the statute book, since it would require wide consultation and allow amendment by a joint committee of both houses. The two alternatives are to table a fresh Commons motion, or to publish a bill.</p> <p>In a marathon legal battle going back to 2004, the court has repeatedly ruled that a general and automatic disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners is incompatible with European law.</p> <p>The UK government was given six months from a judgment in Scoppola v Italy on 22 May 2012 to bring forward legislative proposals to amend the law.</p> <p>But the court has also accepted that member states should have a wide discretion as to how they regulate a ban on prisoner voting, in terms of the kind of offence, length of prison sentence, and the discretion given to individual judges to determine a prisoner's right to vote.</p> <p>The British government's already acute dilemma has been deepened by the Commons overwhelmingly passing a motion in February 2011 stating that it supports \"the current situation in which no sentenced prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for contempt default or reprimand\". The motion was passed by 234 to 22.</p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, accused the government of creating another confusing shambles: \"The Tory-led government's sheer confusion this morning over whether prisoners will or won't get the vote is yet another illustration of the ridiculously shambolic way they are running our country.</p> <p>\"The public will be rightly concerned at reports prisoners could get a vote. If true, thousands of those serving sentences for serious and violent crimes such as wounding, assault and domestic violence would be given a say in who runs the country. Instead of the chaos of leaks and spin we've seen this morning, the public deserve the truth about the government's intentions.\"</p>",

Surely, they say, being as visible as technology and vanity permits is the only sensible option? Sceptics counter that such garish outfits a) perpetuate the idea that cycling is inherently unsafe, putting off would-be new riders and b) places responsibility/blame with the rider rather than encouraging drivers to be more vigilant.</p> <p>Having introduced that debate I'm now going to sideline it entirely to ask instead: if you're taking the high-vis route how far can you go? What weapons are in the armoury of the extreme high-vis-er? Here are two approaches, one tried out by myself, the other by Uli Kraeling, a reader. They're arguably not flattering, but they certainly get you seen:</p> <h2>The Visijax jacket</h2> <p>Even before its array of high-tech gizmos have been switched on, the <a href=\"http://visijax.com/home\">Visijax rain jacket</a> is perhaps the brightest single thing I've ever seen. An eye-melting yellow/lime shade which somehow transcends day-glo to approach outright luminescence, it is possibly visible from space. If that's not enough it's covered in reflective trim.</p> <p>But the British-designed jacket's main selling point comes when you press the button on a small plastic battery compartment tucked into an inner pocket. Suddenly, this is part jacket, part Christmas tree. Rows of tiny but very bright white LED lights flash on the front and some red ones at the back. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398267815\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/visijax_460.jpg\" alt=\"Bike Blog - Visijax high viz jacket\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Visijax jacket - part coat, part Christmas tree. Photograph: Visijax</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visijax</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sort of trickery we have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/nov/02/lights-visible-night\">seen before</a>. But the Visijax's party piece comes when you raise an arm to indicate a turn. All of a sudden sets of amber lights flash on the front and rear of the appropriate sleeve.</p> <p>The effect is certainly different, and whether or not you like it largely depends on personal taste. My view errs more towards \"a solution seeking a problem\", but then virtually all my night-time riding takes place in London, where darkness is a relative concept. I might take a different view if my ride took me into less well-lit outer suburbs, let alone rural roads.</p> <p>It's worth mentioning too, that the Visijax seems to function pretty well as a waterproof jacket, albeit one that's a bit on the baggy side for my tastes. It has a cosy fleece inner collar and, unlike some very high-viz products, is relatively lightweight and not inordinately sweaty.</p> <p>Did I feel a bit self conscious, blinking like a mobile traffic light, or pretend car, every time I lifted an arm? A bit. But I'm sure you get used to it.</p> <h2>The 'Polite' waistcoat</h2> <p>For more than three months I have been cycling with a kind of novelty hi-visibility jacket I found online. I was just looking for something that would be more durable than the building site hi-vis vests I used to wear. </p> <p>My <a href=\"http://www.highvisibility.uk.com/cycling/polite-cycling-waistcoat\">new waistcoat</a> features, in large, capitalised white-on-blue letters, the word \"Polite\" on the back, as well as blue and white reflective checkerboard detail around the shoulders. The intention is clear: to make road users think, at least on first glance, that you're a police officer on a bike.</p> <p>The website is full of satisfied customers feeding back how they felt like they had a forcefield around them when wearing the garment, so I decided to give it a try. In combination with my predominantly black cycling gear and a white helmet, the disguise is complete: whenever I see my own reflection in a passing car window, I nearly get caught out myself. </p> <p>So far I have refrained from acquiring the additional <a href=\"http://www.highvisibility.uk.com/cycling/polite-cycling-hat-band\">checkerboard helmet band</a> which complements the vest. There's a whole range of similar items, many for horse riders, for whom the idea was originally developed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398267816\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/polite.jpg\" alt=\"Bike blog - polite jacket\" width=\"460\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kraeling wearing the 'Polite' cycling jacket. Photograph: Uli Kraeling</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: reader</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since I started wearing this on my daily commute to and from Kingston in west London to Kings Cross in the north of the city, the vest has definitely had an effect, though not always in ways I might have expected. Friends and colleagues warned me not to cycle through any dodgy areas while wearing the outfit and I am sure I have had a bottle thrown at me the other day.</p> <p>Every now and then at red traffic lights fellow cyclists and even pedestrians inquire where I got the jacket, but so far I have never encountered a fellow wearer.</p> <p>The idea of this garment is obviously to get more respect on the road and I feel drivers have been reacting in different ways: I can hear a lot more braking and taking the foot of the gas going on behind me and I feel I do get a wider berth than before from some. With others, though, I feel like they want to emphasize they are not fooled by my disguise and so overtake closely with a revving engine.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, the vest has also changed my own behaviour on the road: I am now sticking a lot more to the Highway Code so as to keep up the disguise of a law enforcer \u2013 who would fall for a policeman going against the one-way system and jumping red lights? Getting a shorter haircut was a pure coincidence, though, and not an attempt to further deceive.</p> <p>Initially I was even concerned I might get arrested for impersonating a policeman but then found out it was actually a superintendent who devised this jacket. By now, I have passed so many police cars and bobbies on the beat without any problems that I am not worried anymore.</p> <p>The other morning, a motorist halted me and asked me to intervene in a traffic dispute \u2013 she was apparently being followed by another driver. Said driver pulled up next to me a few seconds later and addressed me directly: 'You should have heard what she said to me, officer!\" When the red mist of road rage comes up you are obviously more gullible. </p> <p>I revealed I was not a policeman and they sped off, still arguing at the next red light. I wish I had been more prepared for this situation. I mainly thought a policeman with a German accent would not seem very credible. Maybe the bike blog readers could suggest what to do if it happens again? </p> <p>Surprisingly even fellow cyclists can be fooled: I was told a group of road cyclist had put the brakes on behind me on a fast downhill section in Richmond Park, thinking I was a policeman about to enforce the 20mph speed limit.</p> <p>Would I recommend the \"Polite\" vest? It's certainly well made and looks the part. If you're undecided but would like to test the public's response, maybe try it out on a stag do/hen night, when it might be more acceptable to dress up as a policeman or woman.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Uli Kraeling, 34, is an architect originally from Munich, who rides for transport and for sport.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Hats off to Sir Christopher Bland, the very Tory ex-chairman of the BBC, for going on Radio 4's Today on Wednesday morning and urging his former colleagues and \u2013 by extension \u2013 everyone else to \"keep calm\" until the full facts emerge about its alleged multiple failures to check Jimmy Savile's sexual rampage through the corporation.</p> <p>It's not looking good for the BBC. It hasn't looked good since the ITV expos\u00e9 of Savile's record first prompted denials from TV Centre and Broadcasting House that there had been any corporate cowardice or cover-up down the decades, let alone that Newsnight's investigation last year was canned because it might have skewered tributes to Saint Jimmy in the Christmas schedule.</p> <p>No one I know, including people with plenty of experience of how the BBC works, believed it. Chris Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/23/lord-patten-defends-bbc-jimmy-savile-scandal\" title=\"\">defended its independence</a> on Tuesday night after a salvo from Maria Miller, the Tory culture secretary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n6rs9\" title=\"\">sounded pretty feeble</a> when grilled by Steve Hewlett on Radio 4's Media Show two weeks ago. Five weeks into his job as the Patten-appointed director-general, George Entwistle, sounded feeble too when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/23/incurious-george-entwistle-flak-jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">grilled by MPs</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>That's all as it should be. Major public institution screws up and is held to account. Reviews and inquiries are launched and \u2013 in the old BBC joke \u2013 assistant heads must roll. Newsnight capo Peter Rippon, of email fame, has duly stepped aside and (begging Sir Christopher Bland's pardon) will probably never step back again.</p> <p>In Tuesday's Daily Mail, the redoubtable Max Hastings tells a sad tale of BBC \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2221659/Jimmy-Savile-scandal-The-BBC-empire-control-freaks-cowards.html?ITO=1490\" title=\"\">control freaks and cowards</a>\", which sounds truer than I would wish. But it's also true that the BBC's Panorama programme has played a powerful role in exposing the corporation's weakness \u2013 something you won't often see inside a Fleet Street media group.</p> <p>I've not touched this subject since 8 October when I asked \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/blog/2012/oct/09/jimmy-savile-tabloids-bbc-allegations\" title=\"\">why didn't the tabloids nail him</a>?\" No point in joining the stone-throwing mob when there's nothing more to say, I told a Twitter follower who taunted me about my apparent silence a few days ago.</p> <p>I reported the tabloids' explanations at the time, albeit without being very impressed because I know the lengths to which they sometimes go to nail villains \u2013 occasionally using illegal techniques that can be justified in the public interest, though (obviously) not in Milly Dowler's case and other examples of prurient intrusion and low-grade gossip-peddling. As at the BBC, Fleet Street is a mixture of types \u2013 control freaks, cowards and the occasional hero among them.</p> <p>The Daily Beast, the News of the Beast, the Beast on Sunday, all tough guys and proud of it, could have tried harder to confirm their suspicions. But like George Entwistle-in-the-Dark they chose to cross to the other side of the street. Worse than that, as the MPs (few heroes among them either) pointed out yesterday, they went ahead with Christmas tributes to Savile despite what they knew. Arghh!</p> <p>And the Guardian, I hear you ask? Well, yes, I suppose it might have done. But how many news stories did we devote each week to the sex lives of TV celebs and footballers in the 70s, 80s and 90s? Not many, it wasn't our world, we were still more interested in public affairs in the traditional sense. We were also fighting our corner in risky court cases \u2013 Jonathan Aitken, Neil Hamilton, Stoke Newington's dodgy police station \u2013 and winning them too.</p> <p>And at great financial risk. The Titans of the insurance world won't insure you if you rack up costs fighting claimants. Whatever next! So when the Times made serious allegations against a public figure, Lord Michael Ashcroft, Rupert Murdoch pulled the plug and settled rather than waste lawyers' fees fighting the case. Thanks again, Rupert. His papers, sore at the phone-hacking conspiracy, are all busy throwing concrete blocks at their commercial rival, the Beeb. For the Telegraph and Mail \u2013 also owned by absent-for-tax-purposes bosses \u2013 the brick-hurling is more part of Britain's ongoing culture wars \u2013 as Guardian letter-writers point out this morning. The BBC is the Great Satan.</p> <p>But this game is democratic: everyone can join in. Since the Savile allegations broke the stone-throwing mob has got completely out of hand. Charities are reporting a quadrupling of calls to register complaints of alleged child abuse. Ambulance-chasing lawyers with time on their hands are marshalling ever-more claimants to sue the BBC, the NHS (it runs Broadmoor and Stoker Mandeville, two Savile playgrounds) and anyone else they can screw a dime out of.</p> <p>It always happens, just as dog-bites-child epidemics begin as soon as a nasty biting incident is first reported. It will take months, years even, to sort out the real claims from the deluded and the merely opportunist. Some people may \u2013 in the current jargon \u2013 get closure, only the lawyers will much by way of financial closure. I wish a few more of them had devoted their talents to manufacturing things for export rather than gaming the legal system.</p> <p>With the blinding wisdom of hindsight now, everyone says how deplorable it was. A very large number of people who claim to have known what was going on with Savile and his cronies now throw their hands up and say \"no one was interested\". Or \"everyone was after young girls then\". Or \"he was my boss/hero/a star\" etc. It is not impressive, but it is always how wrongdoing and evil thrive. It's not just at TV centre either, is it? Rochdale, Birmingham, a nasty sex ring in the genteel home counties came to court the other day.</p> <p>So next time we're all invited to tut-tut at the way otherwise decent Germans allowed Hitler to do what he did \u2013 or any of his rival villains \u2013 we might remember with a little humility that nameless horrors can happen here, as they do everywhere: just go on to Google and check child-abuse scandals in any country you care to name, then check the Papacy for good luck.</p> <p>The Queen gave Savile a knighthood during the rule of his friend and Chequers host, Margaret Thatcher. Prince Charles was a pal, yet his passion to interfere with things that are often not remotely his business seems to have failed in this case. A strange silence hangs over Clarence House, too.</p> <p>We are belatedly warier about the sexual abuse of child by predatory adults. But have we learned all the lessons about the premature sexualisation of children? I doubt it. The Tory press \u2013 step forward, Melanie Phillips \u2013 loves to blame permissive excess on the \"liberal left\" and sometimes has a point. Try this NHS-backed <a href=\"http://www.respectyourself.ca/\" title=\"\">website</a> Mel's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2221809/NHS-phone-app-features-extraordinarily-explicit-sex-tips-children-young-13.html\" title=\"\">paper</a> highlights today.</p> <p>Good stuff \u2013 or a cause for thoughtful reflection? A bit of both from what little I've seen. But then switch on to kids' TV or check out kids' magazines where the commercial version of child sexual exploitation thrives. Not much of it being run by Guardian readers, I'd say. But, as Saint Jimmy would probably say, \"they're up for it, aren't they?\"</p>",
  "<p>The traditional formula for pitching a new TV show, through references to earlier hits \u2013 \"It's sort of The Liver Birds crossed with The X Factor with costumes from Cranford\" \u2013 acknowledges both the desire of executives to replicate previous successes and the fact that, by this stage in television history, most shows will be, to some extent, derivative.</p> <p>Even so, the terms in which Elementary might have been sold to the American network CBS will arouse strong curiosity in admirers of BBC1's Sherlock, and possibly rather harder emotions in the creators and producers of the British show. (\"We are very proud of our show and like any proud parent, will protect the interest and wellbeing of our offspring,\" said the producer of Sherlock, Sue Vertue, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/legal-thriller-looms-as-sherlock-takes-his-caseload-to-new-york-6292682.html\" title=\"\">earlier this year</a>.)</p> <p>In common with Sherlock, the American series \u2013 which premiered in the UK last night on Sky Living \u2013 is a modern take on Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary private detective, though set in New York rather than London. Lucy Liu plays what we might loosely call the Martin Freeman role (Sherlock's sidekick becomes Dr Joan Watson) to Jonny Lee Miller, who in a sense goes opposite Benedict Cumberbatch for a second time \u2013 the actors co-starred in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/feb/24/review-frankenstein-olivier-theatre-boyle\" title=\"\">National Theatre's Frankenstein</a>.</p> <p>For a British viewer of Elementary, there is a definite sense of watching a very slick and skilful translation of Sherlock, rather as there was with the the BBC and NBC versions of The Office and (less slickly and skilfully) the BBC and ABC series of Life on Mars. In last night's opening episode, Liu and Lee Miller had a dialogue, identical in intent though not specifics, to Cumberbatch and Freeman's first meeting, in which the sleuth made astonishing instant deductions about his newly recruited assistant.</p> <p>Accordingly, it may seem unfair that, while the US versions of The Office and Life on Mars were officially licensed remakes, CBS considers Elementary an original series.</p> <p>The complication, however, is that overlapping elements between the shows \u2013 an addicted private eye with uncanny abilities to read clues in people and crimes \u2013 derive not from Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss's British hit but from the stories of Conan Doyle, who created the characters. The shared aspect that wasn't in the originals \u2013 relocation of the action to a 21st century city \u2013 may encourage a larger sense of grievance, although even here CBS would be able to point to several earlier updatings of Holmes including two made (in 1987 and 1994) by CBS, the first of which featured a female second banana called Jane Watson.</p> <p>To me it seems that the concept of Holmes and present-day spins is sufficiently in the public domain \u2013 House, for example, was a medical Holmes, as the title punningly hints \u2013 for the shows to claim separate inspiration, although the American broadcaster might squirm to explain why it had the idea of doing something like this again, so soon after it had been done triumphantly in the UK. But, even on that narrow point, all lucrative ideas are soon had by others, as the publishers of EL James may wryly note, watching the infinite varieties of Fifty Shades of Grey imitations that commercial rivals are rushing out.</p> <p>The broader question is what constitutes a \"new idea\" in TV. For example, the ITV show General Hospital (ATV, 1972-79) was an officially licensed remake of the American show which marks its 50th anniversary next year. But medical dramas have now become such an accepted format that what we might described as generalised hospital shows \u2013 Casualty, ER, St Elsewhere and so on \u2013 are regularly created without any plagiarism concerns.</p> <p>A stranger case involves GF Newman's and Tony Garnett's BBC drama Law &amp; Order (1978) and Dick Wolfe's identically named Law &amp; Order, which ran on NBC from 1990 to 2010. Although, because of different national models, the UK show ran for four episodes and the US version for 456, both set out to follow single cases through the legal justice system. GF Newman, when I have interviewed him, has expressed irritation about the similarity of the American franchise but the broadness of the subject-matter \u2013 police and legal procedurals have always been two a pound or dollar in TV \u2013 made formal objection difficult. Although Newman's grumpiness understandably increased when the US version licensed an English remake, which has run on ITV1 since 2009.</p> <p>So you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to spot the striking similarities between Sherlock/Elementary and Law &amp; Order/Law &amp; Order \u2013 but, if the idea is general enough, someone can have it a second time.</p>",
  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has risked a backlash from European carmakers and governments by rescuing France's Peugeot Citro\u00ebn with a \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.66bn) state-financing package, as Ford announced the loss of 4,300 jobs in Belgium.</p> <p>The German state of Lower Saxony, the second largest investor in Volkswagen, has already expressed opposition to the financing plan and Peugeot must also seek European Union approval for the deal. Meanwhile Ford said it would shut its Genk plant in Belgium as European carmakers grapple with too much factory capacity amid slumping sales. The French government is offering \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for Peugeot's financing arm, Banque PSA Finance, which underpins Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn dealer networks and car loans.</p> <p>\"The French state has announced its intention to provide up to \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for new bond issues \u2026 A guarantee monitoring committee comprising representatives from the state and the group will be set up,\" said Peugeot, which has no French state shareholding and is 25%-owned by the Peugeot family. The company's future became a state matter in July when Peugeot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/16/european-car-sales-fall-new-car-registrations\" title=\"\">battered by falling European car sales</a>, announced the closure its Aulnay plant near Paris and plans to axe 6,500 jobs.</p> <p>The Peugeot family's control is being weakened by the terms of the government intervention. Peugeot added that it will not pay dividends, launch share buybacks or grant share options to senior executives while the state guarantee is in place. It also agreed to elect an employee to its supervisory board and \"elect more women\". The board will also appoint a new independent member, although reports this week said that independent member would be government-approved.</p> <p>Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French prime minister, said Peugeot would be asked to reconsider the Aulnay closure as a condition of the financing. \"The government has no intention of making gifts without demanding anything in return,\" he said. It is France's biggest intervention in its car industry since 2009, when it gave Peugeot and Renault \u20ac6bn in low-interest loans.</p> <p>Peugeot said this morning that third-quarter sales fell 4% to \u20ac12.9bn in the three months to September. \"The competitive environment is getting tougher, with increased pricing pressure and ongoing deterioration in the markets of southern Europe,\" the company said.</p> <p>Peugeot is not the only Europe-based automotive business struggling with stagnant sales and too much manufacturing capacity. Ford said this morning that it plans to shut its assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, in 2014 with the loss of 4,300 jobs as production moves to Spain. Volvo, the Gothenburg-based truck maker, said it expected no growth in the European and US markets next year after third-quarter orders fell by a quarter compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>The French government gave a show of support to one its stonger industrial players this week. On Tuesday Ayrault attended the inauguration of the final assembly line for the Airbus A350 airplane in Toulouse. In a speech that referred to the pan-European structure of Airbus \u2013 the German, French and Spanish states are stakeholders \u2013 Ayrault also dwelt on France's industrial competitiveness. \"We need to be competitive because we need to fight unemployment this way,\" he said. Referring to the global success of Airbus, which has received orders for more than 550 A350 jets already, he added: \"It shows that France and Europe can be very successful in international competition.\"</p>",
  "<p>A slick shopping centre full of Armani, Prada and L'Occitane stores \u2013 not to mention a casino with a 150-seat poker room \u2013 is a strange place to hold an event aimed at helping people save money on energy bills.</p> <p>But Citizens Advice hopes its <a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/aboutus/bigenergysavingweek.htm\" title=\"\">Big Energy Saving Week</a>, which kicked off at Stratford's Westfield centre on 22 October, will help cash-strapped families around the country avoid falling into fuel poverty. And to have that kind of effect you have to go where the people are \u2013 the shops.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/19/how-to-fix-energy-price-hikes\">soaring cost of gas and electricity is headline news</a> following the latest round of price rises from most of the UK's big six energy firms. Mixed messages from the government over how to tackle the issue have only added to the confusion and helplessness felt by many families.</p> <p>Citizens Advice hopes its week-long focus on energy, and the more than 400 events it is holding across the country, will educate consumers, handing them back the initiative to take control of their finances and to seek the cheapest deals on gas and electricity.</p> <p>Following recent gaffes on energy policy, the Department of Energy and Climate Change sent Baroness Verma along to the launch. The minister was keen to reassert her government's commitment to helping consumers.</p> <p>\"Rising fuel bills are a really big deal,\" she says. \"Consumers really ought to know that help is available and there are lots of things they can access, but it's about getting the message out there and empowering consumers. We are working with industry, which is very aware that consumers are hurting. It's a very difficult time.\"</p> <p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, is less prosaic, warning of an imminent crisis for many households: \"Ofgem and the government have massive questions to answer. It really does need an overhaul of the market, and not just putting a lid on it. Government has a responsibilty to look into competition in the energy market, to see how to get the structure right.</p> <p>\"We'd like some clarity from the government on what it is doing. What worried us is that the government's recent messages sound like a promise that everything will be okay and that this situation will be sorted out for people.</p> <p>\"That's counter to our message which is that people have to sort things out for themselves. I don't want people to relax. It's not going to be all right, winter is upon us and people need to take action now.\"</p> <p>As it nears lunchtime, shoppers who look with interest at gaudy displays in shop windows seem to go glassy-eyed as they near the Big Energy Saving Week stall. They drift aimlessly past, their eyes passing over messages intended to promote and educate money-saving ideas before settling on a new shop display somewhere in the distance.</p> <p>This is the challenge Citizens Advice and the government face: they want households to be proactive in seeking out the cheapest energy supplier, but the reality is that many people do not have the time or inclination to do so.</p> <p>I collar a few shoppers near the 3 mobile phone shop. They all say they are interested in the Big Energy Saving Week and promise to visit the stall. \"I've got three children to support at home, and I've got less work because people aren't making home improvements,\" says David Carpenter, a 43-year-old electrician. \"I'd like to know if I really can save money, because I think all companies are the same. If I switch to a new provider one week, they'll only raise prices again the next.\"</p> <p>Randeep Singh, 29, uses npower as his dual fuel supplier. \"They've just raised prices,\" he says. \"It will hurt us as my wife has had a baby and doesn't work at the moment. It'll be another \u00a3120 or so a year, which is a lot when you earn less than \u00a320,000. How do they expect young families to afford this? The government needs to stop companies from making such large profits \u2013 why should we keep paying higher bills just so big companies can get fatter?\"</p> <p>At the launch are specialist advisers from regional Citizens Advice bureaux (CABs). Saher Osman is a fuel poverty advisor in the Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) area. She explains how the H&amp;F CAB's fuel poverty project has for four years been funded by the EDF Energy Trust \u2013 a registered charity funded by the energy firm \u2013 but that funding is due to expire at the end of 2012.</p> <p>\"I've had a lot of people in real difficulties who I have managed to help, so it's really important projects such as ours continue to be funded,\" she says. \"The chances are slim for us, but we are seeking alternative funding.\"</p> <p>In 2012, EDF Energy funded its trust arm to the tune of \u00a31.99m \u2013 a sum it has committed to match in 2013. H&amp;F CAB has been receiving about \u00a329,000-\u00a330,000 a year for its fuel poverty project, but with EDF directing this money elsewhere Osman admits the timing of the cut couldn't be worse.</p> <p>She adds: \"We're seeing cases of serious fuel poverty across the board, although it's a really big issue for elderly people \u2013 many are not putting their heating on so they can get through the winter. It's going to be a long, cold and expensive winter for many people.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.guardianenergycomparison.co.uk/guardian_editorial\">Switch energy supplier and save money with the Guardian</a></em></p>",
  "<p>In today's financial climate, closely managing the money in your business is more important than ever. However brilliant your idea or amazing your product, a solid financial base is what will keep your business going. Figures from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fintuitglobal.intuit.com%2Fdelivery%2Fcms%2Fprod%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Fintuit.co.uk-blaze%2Fpdf%2FIntuit-Report-The-Three-Year-Glitch.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEARw1TWqUuq4l-p3nBt_4TZ7rjOw\" title=\"\">the Office for National Statistics show that one in three businesses fail in their first three years</a>, and poor financial management is one of the main reasons why.</p> <p>As well as maximising profits and keeping costs down, staying on top of bills and invoices is also essential to maintaining good cashflow. It will help ensure that you've got some money in the bank, receive the most favourable terms from suppliers and don't get any nasty surprises.</p> <p>If you don't get organised fast, keeping track of invoices you're owed and bills you need to pay can become both chaotic and daunting. Here are some tips for establishing the right internal processes to keep your cashflow healthy.</p> <h2>Keep good records</h2> <p>The key to keeping on top of bills and invoices is good record-keeping. Whatever system you use, whether pen and paper (alarm bells should be ringing), spreadsheets or, most reliably, accounting software, keeping good records from the off \u2013 although it's never too late \u2013 will help you stay organised and in control. Try things out and take advantage of free software trials to find the system that's right for your business.</p> <p>The benefit of a proper accounting software package is that you'll have a snapshot of your company's financial situation at a glance. With instant visibility of who owes you what and when it's due, you'll be ready to jump on late payments before you run out of cash.</p> <p>You'll also be able to keep your cashflow healthy by paying bills when they're due but not before, or by taking advantage of early payment discounts. Paying late could lose you credit and good favour with your client, something organised records will help you avoid.</p> <h2>Establish a routine</h2> <p>Monitoring bills and invoices is not something you should only do when your cash card gets rejected or you get an angry call from a supplier \u2013 by the time these things happen, the damage is already done.</p> <p>Set time aside, ideally at least once a week, to manage invoices and make payments. It should be as much a part of your work routine as marketing or paying your staff.</p> <p>Having this regular time will prevent bills and invoices building up and help you head off any emerging problems before they become too big. Never let this task slide down your to-do list.</p> <h2>Ask the experts</h2> <p>Even though you may have the best intentions of managing the books yourself, if you're floundering or just naturally disorganised, consider getting a book-keeper \u2013 it's a far better option than struggling on in chaos. Tools such as accounting software make it easy to collaborate with your accounting help so you don't need to relinquish control.</p> <p>Your accountant or a book-keeper can also cast their expert eye over the way you do things to see how your processes for managing invoices and bills could be improved. Don't be afraid to ask.</p> <h2>Tighten up invoicing</h2> <p>\u2022 The sooner you send invoices out, the sooner you'll get paid. Make sure you have a system in place for sending invoices as soon as the work is done \u2013 software generates invoices which you can email out instantly, and online systems even allow you to invoice when you're on the move.</p> <p>\u2022 There are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers\" title=\"\">several pieces of information</a> you must include on an invoice \u2013 make sure your invoice is accurate every time to prevent any delays.</p> <p>\u2022 Unfortunately, some people just won't pay unless you chase them. Make sure you track what's owed so you can follow up late payments straight away using the aged debtor report in your accounts package.</p> <p>Send reminders and statements of account to clients so they know what they owe. If you know someone is regularly late with payments, you can even track the due date and send a gentle nudge before your invoice becomes overdue.</p> <h2>Organise your outgoings</h2> <p>\u2022 Consider implementing a purchase order system if you don't already. This helps you avoid the common and costly mistake of paying an invoice twice.</p> <p>\u2022 You'll need to find the system that's right for your business, whether you file paid bills by name or date, but whatever you choose, make sure you are consistent in your method of filing so you can access documents and clear up any queries quickly.</p> <p>\u2022 It might seem old school but it really works \u2013 use a stamp when processing paper invoices so you can quickly tick off when they have been authorised, recorded and paid.</p> <p><em>Sally Revell is head of marketing for Intuit UK, maker of </em><a href=\"http://www.intuit.co.uk/quickbooks/accounting-software.jsp\" title=\"\"><em>QuickBooks accountancy software</em></a><em> for small businesses and accounting professionals.</em></p> <p><em>What are your tips for other small businesses on staying on top of what you owe and what you're owed?</em></p> <p><strong>Also, don't forget to submit your entry now for the cashflow category of our </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/small-business-network/best-practice-exchange\" title=\"\"><strong>Best Practice Exchange</strong></a><strong>.

For example, The Transporter (where Jason Statham played a transporter) is completely different to The Mechanic (where Jason Statham played a mechanic). Then there's The Expendables (where Jason Statham played an expendable), which couldn't have been more different to The Bank Job (where Jason Statham played a bank job). </p> <p>All of which means that Jason Statham's next film, Parker, could legitimately be about anything.

A cowboy called Daniel Parmitt from San Antonio, Texas. Or, as Statham prefers to call him, \"Dernyurl Pyarmunk frurm Snanternierexers\".

  "<blockquote> \"Sort of everybody knew about it. I thought, well, there's no use hiding it, it's out there, and I was quite surprised that there was this thing called penile cancer and at the time I think I just wanted to jump on this crusade of, you know, enlightening people that this thing exists \u2013 watch it!\" </blockquote> <p>These are the words of Les, who was diagnosed with penile cancer at 41. They're taken from a qualitative research project conducted by Dr Peter Branney and colleagues at the Centre for Men's Health, Leeds Metropolitan University. The research draws upon interviews with <a href=\"http://www.healthtalkonline.org/Cancer/penile_cancer\" title=\"\">29 survivors of penile cancer</a>, and forms the basis of a new awareness campaign by the award-winning charitable project Health Talk Online.</p> <p>Although less common than many forms of the disease, penile cancer affects about 400 new cases every year in the UK. It is especially amenable to awareness-raising because it displays symptoms sooner than many cancers and, if diagnosed early, can often be removed with a quick and easy operation. If left later, the surgery may need to be more radical, or eventually the disease may become untreatable. One finding of the research is that many diagnoses are delayed because affected men or, worse, their doctors often wrongly attribute symptoms to a sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>It doesn't require much imagination to understand the profound psychological impacts of penile cancer, or treatments such as partial or total penectomy, upon someone's identity as a man. Many of the study's subjects describe a sense of emasculation, sexual frustration and sense of inadequacy as a husband or partner.</p> <p>While not directly equivalent, these emotions may be familiar to many of the tens of thousands of women living with or after breast cancer. There is something that seems exceptionally cruel about a disease that attacks our sexual identity and most intimate body parts, but as several of the penile cancer subjects confirm, patients often justifiably resent having their health, wellbeing and gender identity reduced to a single body part. That puts charities and awareness campaigns in an extremely delicate position.</p> <p>October is breast cancer awareness month and, especially in the US, corporate brands have been bedecked with pink ribbons. One particular fundraising effort can perhaps be seen as an object lesson in how not to raise funds and awareness. The hardcore video tube Pornhub has promised to donate to breast cancer research for every click on videos in their big boobs and small boobs section. If you're already recoiling from the crass association between sex and cancer, the offence is compounded many times over by their advertising tagline: <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5949091/komen-surprisingly-rejects-funding-from-pornhubs-save-the-boobies-campaign\" title=\"\">Save the Boobies</a>. Yes, you read that right \u2013 not saving lives or saving women, just their breasts. At least one cancer charity has already rejected their cash, but the site is unrepentant.</p> <p>But is it ever possible to link sexuality and cancer awareness in an appropriate way? Yes, I think it is. A few years ago the men's cancer charity Everyman produced a hit viral featuring Rachel Stevens seductively inviting viewers to \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu2K4eIqxd4\" title=\"\">check their plums</a>\" for testicular lumps. Tacky? Probably, but also highly effective. More recently, a community of (mostly female) erotic bloggers from RSVP Erotica and Sinful Sunday have been tagging their amateur offerings with links to breast cancer awareness campaigns. Such efforts may not appeal to everyone but, in my view at least, they tread the tightrope quite well, helping to spread information without slipping into gross exploitation.</p> <p>As we slip beyond October, we will welcome <a href=\"http://uk.movember.com/\" title=\"\">Movember</a>, the annual national moustache-growing contest. This initiative to highlight male-specific cancers was a long time coming, and has thrived on the link between a simple totem of masculinity and men's health, without dwelling on the obvious implications for sexual potency of testicular, prostate or penile cancer. It is nonetheless inevitable that there will sometimes be connections drawn between what we might call more intimate cancers and sexuality. As any marketer will tell you, sex sells, and nothing catches public attention like a sexual hook. Any charities or campaigns that can find a path through the minefield of ethics, morality and good taste would be likely to mine a rich seam.</p> <p>As a starter, how much better would it be if an operation like Pornhub were to exercise its charitable impulses by donating to Movember for every click on a collection of vintage porn clips featuring classic 1970s moustaches? Unlike the Save the Boobies campaign, it would at least be funny. Cancer is never sexy, and nor should it be, but as many of the interviews on Health Talk Online confirm, a sense of humour is all but essential.</p>",
  "<p>The co-operative movement was brought into being by the writings and lectures of <a href=\"http://www.robert-owen.com\">Robert Owen</a>, whose ideas on mutuality and co-operation were very influential on the working class movement in the first half of the C19th </p> <p>Owen was born in Newtown in mid-Wales in 1771. He had little schooling, but came to Manchester where he worked in a drapers in St Ann's Square. Like many other young ambitious men, he went into the expanding cotton trade and progressed to running his own mills, the Oxford Road Twist Company. </p> <p>In 1799 Robert took a step which changed his life when he bought the <a href=\"http://www.newlanark.org/\">New Lanark Mills </a>and moved to Scotland to run them. The mills employed 2000 people, including 500 children. He now had an opportunity to put his ideas on social reform into practice, introducing a minimum age of ten for apprentices, improving housing and sanitation and opening a shop whose profits were used to fund a free village school. </p> <p>He published his ideas on educational and social reform, advocating a society run on harmonious co-operative lines, and undertook lecture tours to publicise them. Here is a ringing example of his credo:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What ideas individuals may attach to the term 'Millennium' I know not; but I know that society may be formed so as to exist without crime, without poverty, with health greatly improved, with little, if any misery, and with intelligence and happiness increased a hundredfold; and no obstacle whatsoever intervenes at this moment except ignorance to prevent such a state of society from becoming universal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many listened but not all. Disillusioned by the lack of response from his fellow manufacturers, Owen left England for the United States, where he tried to establish a co-operative community in New Harmony, Indiana. Initially settlers flocked to join but, as often happens in such communities, divisions soon arose and in the summer of 1828 he returned to England </p> <p>During his absence his ideas on co-operation had taken hold amongst some groups of radicals with a number of co-operative societies being formed in Manchester and elsewhere. The first co-operative Congress took place on 26-27 May 1831 in the Spread Eagle pub on Chapel Street, Salford. It was reported at length in the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>.</p> <blockquote> <p>At half-past eleven o'clock, a meeting of the delegates and others was held for the transaction of business. Mr Elijah Dixon was in the chair. Fifty-six societies were represented by forty-six delegates and ten others sent letters. The principal object of deliberation was the formation of a general union of all the co-operative societies in the north of England, for the purpose of establishing a general store in Liverpool, and appointing an agent and secretary there to superintend the business of the union. From this store goods are proposed to be furnished at very moderate prices to all the co-operative societies in the union, the surplus profits to be appropriated to the foundation of a harmonious community on the plan of Robert Owen, or to such purposes as the delegates may deem proper. </p> <p>About half-past four o'clock, a great many members and delegates assembled together, in what they termed \" a co-operative tea-party\", at the Town Hall, Salford, which was tastefully decorated on this occasion with festoon of flowers. About half-past five o'clock Mr Robert Owen, of New Lanark celebrity, entered the room and was, of course, received with great applause. </p> <p>At length Mr Owen, attended by a number of friends, ascended into the orchestra, and from thence addressed the company in a long speech in which he professed to explain what co-operation meant. He concluded by intimating that his system would eventually bring about the millennium, that happy period, when every man should sit under his own vine and his own fig tree, and none should make him afraid. </p> </blockquote> <p>In 1835 Salford co-operators opened a Social&#xa0;Institution on Great George Street which could hold up to 600 people.&#xa0; Robert Cooper, one of the teachers at the co-operative school, wrote that the windows</p> <blockquote> <p>were of stained class, the floors carpeted and the platform neat and elegant, ornamented with mottos in gilt mouldings. Altogether it bore an aspect of comfort and respectability, such as I never saw before or since in connection with an almost purely working class movement.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the movement outgrew the building, the co-operators built the Hall of Science in Campfield, Manchester where there were meetings, lectures and tea-parties. Friedrich Engels was a regular visitor during his time in Manchester in the mid-1840s. The hall only survived to 1844 when it closed and was sold but in 1852 the Manchester Free Library was established in the building. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398254326\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2011/5/13/1305283326122/co-op-history-002.jpg\" alt=\"co-op history\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Older model. Same principles. Photograph: Co-operative Group</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Co-operative Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The modern co-operative movement usually traces its origins back to the Rochdale Pioneers, who opened a shop in Toad Lane, Rochdale on 21 December 1844. <a href=\"http://www.rochdalepioneersmuseum.coop\">The building is now a museum</a>. The rules developed and codified in Rochdale guided the spread and development of the movement. They included a commitment to providing pure, unadulterated food, an insistence on cash payment for goods; dividends for members and democratic control. They also put aside two and a half per cent for educational purposes. Every member was given a unique number and the dividend was paid quarterly (the \"divi\" as it became known was abolished in 1974 but was re-introduced in 2006 in the form of a card).</p> <p>This more managed business model was successful and spread across the world. Some mourned the end of the radical years of the movement, though. Cooper wrote wistfully: </p> <blockquote> <p>In our old Chartist time, it is true, Lancashire working men were in rags by the thousand; and many of them lacked food. But their intelligence was demonstrated wherever you went. You could see them in groups discussing the great doctrine of political justice \u2013 that every grown up, sane man ought to have a vote in the election of the men who were to make the laws by which he was to be governed; or they were in earnest dispute respecting the teachings of socialism. Now you will see no such groups in Lancashire. But you will hear well-dressed men talking, as they walk with their hands in their pockets of 'Co-ops' and their shares in them, or in building societies.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398254327\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351054822495/michael_herbert.jpg\" alt=\"michael herbert\" width=\"140\" height=\"135\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Michael Herbert is a Trustee of the <a href=\"http://www.wcml.org.uk\">Working Class Movement Library </a>and leads walks exploring Manchester's radical history for <a href=\"http://redflagwalks.wordpress.org\">Red Flag walks</a>.</em></p> <p><em>His book 'Up Then Brave Women: Manchester Radical Women 1819-1919' was published on 15 October and is on sale at the <a href=\"http://www.phm.org.uk\">Peoples History Museum</a>, Manchester, <a href=\"http://www.threeminutetheatre.co.uk\">Three Minute Theatre</a>, Manchester, the <a href=\"http://www.theportico.org.uk\">Portico Library</a>, Manchester, and <a href=\"http://www.rochdalepioneersmuseum.coop\">Rochdale Pioneers Museum</a>.</em></p>",

It is a tragedy. The so-called Libyan army, which are in reality a bunch of thugs, are behaving like locusts. They are attacking everything in their way.</p> <p>This Misrata army are stationed at the entrances of Beni Walid and using all sorts of weapons, tanks, rockets and gases against the people.</p> <p>They keep shooting the city for 10 hours at random and then have a few troops on the ground and some others in small vans trying to infiltrate, but the men of Beni Walid who are hiding in houses open fire and push them back.</p> <p>Till now these thugs could not get inside the town owing to the fierce resistance by the people of Bani Walid. Before, we had Gaddafi's army. Now we have armed militias killing women and children. They have been surrounding the city for 20 days but within the last five days they got crazy and have made our lives here a real hell.</p> <p>There is no safe place to hide in Bani Walid. I was in opposition to Gaddafi and was imprisoned in Abu Salim prison for a long time, but I regret every moment I opposed Gaddafi after what I have seen here.</p> <p>These armed militias are so barbarian, they are committing crimes against humanity and no one is recognising that. There is a complete blackout on what is going on here. All the shelling against the city is random, bodies are in the streets for both sides and others are still under rubble \u2013 no one can help as they will be shelled too.</p> <p>There is only one hospital in the whole of Bani Walid, where more than 100,000 people live. It is already in an appalling situation and lacks most of the basic medical stuff. Water and power are cut but people have stored food at home.</p> <p>Some of the families started to flee to escape the shelling. More than 50,000 people left but the route outside the city is a rocky and desert one and really hard to go through with children. Other families decided to stay for fear of robbery. People are worried to leave their houses and come back to find everything is stolen.</p> <p>I left during the liberation war but when I came back I found my car was stolen. This time I am staying and will die in my home. We call upon the humanitarian society to come and help us as the city is entirely sealed off and even fleeing is not safe.</p> <p>This is an act of revenge and racism. People have decided to defend their homes and honour with the arms they have and I can assure you if the situation continues like that, Libya will slip to a civil war eventually.</p> <p>They are destroying an entire city but people will not keep silent, there are more than 53 tribes in Bani Walid and they have decided to die for their land.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T13:44:24.479Z\">at 2.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087d818b5794584b1c13ed2\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:59:20.282Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today's main news is that international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi says he has agreement from the Syrian government on a ceasefire for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha which begins on Friday.</strong></p> <p><strong>Brahimi also says \"most\" of the anti-Assad fighting groups that he has been able to contact agree on \"the principle\" of a ceasefire.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Syrian government has yet to confirm its agreement, and there have been widespread doubts as to whether a ceasefire can take hold or be sustained.</strong></p> <p>Other Syria-related news:</p> <p>\u2022 At least 20 people are reported to have died when Syrian artillery gunners shelled a bread bakery full of workers and customers in Aleppo on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u2022 Government aircraft attacked Maaret al-Numan and the village of Mar Shamsheh yesterday, as troops and rebels battled over a nearby Syrian military camp that has been under siege for days, AP reports citing the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p> <p>\u2022 Syrian rebels have acquired portable surface-to-air missiles including US-made Stingers, the Interfax news agency quoted Russia's senior general as saying today.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:59:58.159Z\">at 12.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087d2ecb5794584b1c13ecd\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:37:16.693Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Concern over move to deport Syrian</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Amnesty International is \"deeply alarmed\" at an attempt by the UK Border Agency to forcibly return a Syrian activist to Damascus.</p> <p>\"The planned removal was due to take place on 21 October, but was prevented in the high court, due in part to Amnesty\u2019s intervention in the case,\" Amnesty says in <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20396\">a statement</a> issued today.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amnesty provided information about the current human rights crisis in Syria and expressed grave concerns about conditions in the country and fears for the safety of the individual if returned.</p> <p>As far as Amnesty is aware, no other EU countries are currently returning Syrian asylum seekers to Syria.</p> <p>Amnesty told the court that people who oppose or are perceived to oppose the government are at risk of persecution or serious harm by the authorities if returned to Syria.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T13:45:46.746Z\">at 2.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087cf4e95cb4897f0db524c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:21:50.197Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A 'last chance' for Syria?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A ceasefire in Syria, if it happens, must be welcome even for three days to stem the bloodshed and perhaps provide a platform to exit this crisis, says Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However, this remains distant, as there is no final decision by the regime and it may well be banking on its opponents rejecting a deal, just to gain positive PR for Assad.</p> <p>If there is a genuine prospect that a ceasefire will hold then the international community must act to shore it up with a much larger monitoring force than in the past, local ceasefire deals and a resolute consensus by Syrian, regional and international actors not to undermine it.&#xa0;</p> <p>It should be reinforced by full humanitarian access and release of prisoners.

In other areas, the authorities have been selective in their demolition orders. The campaign against illegal construction is thus being used to send a message: if you rebel against the regime, you will no longer enjoy the favours bestowed by it.</p> <p>A further complication is that officials also accept hefty bribes from internally displaced people to allow them to use abandoned or partly demolished buildings.

Ennahda may well have squandered its best opportunity to secure control of Tunisia.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50879d7b95cb4897f0db5220\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T07:53:40.293Z\">8.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome to Middle East live.

  "<p>Residential homes across the country will throw open their doors next summer for the first \"care homes open day\", seeking to build links with their local communities.</p> <p>The event, planned for 21 June, reflects a growing awareness that care homes are often too isolated from the communities in which they are located. Ignorance of what goes on behind their walls fuels negative stereotypes, while the homes are missing out on the potential contribution of neighbours and other volunteers.</p> <p>The need to position care homes as a positive residential option for many older people is one of the main conclusions of the final report of the My Home Life project, a joint initiative by charities Age UK and Dementia UK, City University London and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation to promote choice and control for people living in residential settings. The&#xa0;keys to doing so, the report concludes, lie in homes working in partnership with others,&#xa0;strong leadership by home managers and the development of \"relationship-centred\" care.</p> <p>More than 400,000 older people live in about 18,000 care homes in England. Although the thrust of government policy is to encourage more people to live&#xa0;longer&#xa0;in their own homes, the My&#xa0;Home Life report, published this week, says demand for residential care is predicted to rise, with a growing number of older people experiencing multiple healthcare conditions.</p> <p>The three-year project has involved both analysis and action research: 250 care home managers took part in a leadership-support programme designed to foster cultural change in their homes so that staff might develop relationships with residents that enable them to better understand their interests, views and needs. Taking sufficient time is critical to this, as contributors to the debate on the My Home Life website have stressed. As one said: \"Residents often want staff just to sit and talk to them without simultaneously attending to their care needs.\"</p> <p>Other popular themes on the website have included regular provision of activities for care home residents and frequent opportunities, encouraged by staff, for them to venture outside. One post suggested residents should have access to an outside area day and night so they might \"experience the feel of the&#xa0;elements\".</p> <p>The report acknowledges there is already much good practice in many care&#xa0;homes. But some others plainly have a long way to go. One website contributor said: \"After three months' complaining, relative now has alert button within reach and regular drinks.\"&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>Forty-six per cent of Syria's buildings are illegally constructed, according to a government study in 2007 \u2013 and this includes the homes in which more than half the population live. The problem was mostly seen around the large cities but, amid a widening gap between rich and poor, the authorities generally turned a blind eye to it.</p> <p>Particularly since this summer, though, they have been bulldozing illegal buildings \u2013 but only in restive areas. In other areas, the authorities have been selective in their demolition orders. The campaign against illegal construction is thus being used to send a message: if you rebel against the regime, you will no longer enjoy the favours bestowed by it.</p> <p>A further complication is that officials also accept hefty bribes from internally displaced people to allow them to use abandoned or partly demolished buildings. Additionally, the regime's militias and rank-and-file officers are raiding houses, ransacking and then fraudulently selling or leasing them.</p> <p>Besides adding to people's suffering amid the current conflict, these practices are reshaping neighbourhoods across the country, from large cities to small villages \u2013 which is a recipe for future clashes between the old and new owners. Many will feel their properties have been usurped by other people or bought cheaply and at some point may try to retake them.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mona, 37 years old, used to live with her five children in a flat under construction in Adra,&#xa0;about 24km east Damascus where low-income workers and military personnel live. Earlier this month, five intelligence officers raided her flat and asked her to leave.&#xa0;</p> <p>Adra has been a destination for displaced people from other restive areas, like Douma, Harasta, and Dhumair. Hundreds of families have moved there, some of them sleep in the streets and others have occupied buildings under construction.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hussain al-Ali, a 68-year-old man in Adra, was threatened by a member of the \"local committees\" \u2013 pro-regime groups of local residents to protect their own areas \u2013 to be evicted from his flat if he does not continuously stay in it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pro-government committees control many buildings in those areas, according to Mohammed Hamdan, a blogger from Damascus. They claim the flats are being used for humanitarian purposes but in reality they use them to earn money from displaced people.</p> <p>Racan Alhoch, an activist from Damascus's Midan neighbourhood, told me: \"If a home was abandoned, the Assad army would enter it, ransack it, take what they find and label it the home of a traitor.\" Alhoch added that there were incidents of regime's militias selling a property to more than one buyer, only for buyers to find out the property was to be demolished.</p> <p>Alawite residents in Damascus are said to be selling their properties in the outskirts, including in the neighbourhoods of Mazza-86 and Tadhamun, and moving back to their old villages. These residents had originally moved from their villages in the country's middle and western region to illegally constructed houses in Damascus after President Assad's father took power. Buyers, however, are reluctant to purchase these houses fearing the owners will retake them if the regime does not fall.&#xa0;</p> <p>There has been a tendency to buy properties from people escaping the violence for extremely cheap prices, according to Alhoch. \"These wealthy men are going to sit on these properties until post-revolution then sell them for profit which gives us a whole slew of issues to deal with in post-revolution [Syria],\" Alhoch said.</p> <p>More than 800 flats have been occupied by non-owners in Damascus, according to an official. A similar scenario is playing out in Aleppo, where displaced people have illegally occupied 1,800 flats owned by the government's housing authority.&#xa0;Also, many people from Aleppo's countryside moved to the city and occupied deserted buildings.</p> <p>Other complications include proving ownership when refugees outside the country return, considering that many had left in haste without carrying their belongings with them. And people currently exploiting violence to buy properties cheaply are already being labelled as war beneficiaries.</p> <p>The issue of displacement in general is among the legacies that Syrians will have to deal with far into the future, from the displacement of Kurds by the regime in the 1970s to the ongoing practices that are being overlooked by the regime. As the violence continues in Syria, the issue is likely to deepen. And the consequences remain to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>Ever fancied yourself as the next big author? Got characters, creatures and adventures buzzing around in your head? Well, it's time to put pen to paper and make your imagination come alive.</p> <p>November is National Novel Writing Month or NaNoWriMo for short. It's a worldwide event that challenges people to write a whole novel in just a month - that's 30 days! Last year 50,000 young writers started scribbling away on 1 November and completed their own masterpieces. It's a good challenge as you're able to set your own realistic word count goal (whereas adults have to write 50,000 words) so you can push yourself at your own rate.</p> <p>It's the sort of challenge that you can attack like Harry attacks Voldemort - never giving up, using help from your friends and sharing ideas with others. A good way to begin might be to get a huge piece of paper and write down EVERYTHING that comes into in your head. Anything from a character you dreamt about to your favourite food to a song that makes you dance to a place you can only imagine. Spend as long as you need doing this until the paper is full. Then sit back and admire your brain. Then, draw line between ideas that seem to link. This will show you just how creative you are AND, more importantly, give you some amazing ideas to help you start your novel.</p> <p>You never know, you might end up writing something that is funnier than Artemis Fowl. More adventurous than the Hobbit. More imaginative than Peter Pan. More touching than The Selfish Giant. And more scrumdiddlyumptious than the Twits...</p> <p>If you want to take part then check out the <a href=\"ywp.nanowrimo.org/\">Young Writer's NaNoWriMo website</a> to enter.

A lot of comments have been made about this commitment. But we have to understand how markets work. Interventions are designed to send a clear signal to investors that their fears about the euro area are baseless.</p> <p>Second, as a pre-requisite for OMTs, countries must have negotiated with the other euro area governments a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme with strict and effective conditionality. This ensures that governments continue to correct economic weaknesses while the ECB is active. The involvement of the IMF, with its unparalleled track record in monitoring adjustment programmes would be an additional safeguard.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121024.en.html\">The full statement has been uploaded to the ECB website</a>.</p> <p>Draghi also warned that deflation is a bigger risk than inflation today, which may not convince German lawmakers who fear a return to the 1920s.</p> <p>Dow Jones Newswires' <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/djfxtrader\"><strong>FXTrader</strong></a> service tweets other highlights:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082243638886400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Sees Weak Economy In Near Term, Gradual Recovery in 2013</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082243638886400\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:30:32+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082649303605248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Tells German Lawmakers Governments Alone Could Not Remove Fear</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082649303605248\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:32:08+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082759487971329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Says ECB Only \"Fully Credible Backstop\" Could Remove Market Fear</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082759487971329\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:32:35+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:56:31.068Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087e10695cb4897f0db525c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:37:26.540Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany denies Greek deal is done</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>News is flashing up that Germany has denied that Greece has got the two-year extension (as finance minister Stournaras claimed - see last few posts).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/261080782012039168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>***German government spokesman says there is no basis for the Greek 2-year extension reports***</p>&mdash; Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/261080782012039168\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:24:43+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Curiouser and curiouser.

  "<p>Jean Saunders is glad to be back in her bungalow in the former mining community of Swillington, near Leeds, sat safely in her favourite chair after the latest in a series of falls led to another hospital stay. But the 69-year-old, who has Parkinson's disease and has been taking antidepressants since her husband died earlier this year, says it is neither medical care nor bereavement counselling that she needs most \u2013 but company.</p> <p>\"I've been lonely, just stuck here by myself, and don't see many people,\" says Saunders, who worked for 27 years as a sheltered housing warden. \"My daughter, who lives on the other side of Leeds, comes twice a week to see to my shopping, and I get on all right with the neighbours. But some days the only person I see is my carer at breakfast time. It can feel that nobody is caring, that I'm being left out.\"</p> <p>Then she adds: \"But since Trevor came on the scene, things have been a lot better.\"</p> <p>Trevor is Trevor Stephenson, a Leeds council social worker, who has been finding ways that volunteers from a local \"neighbourhood network\" group, Garforth Neighbourhood Elders Team (Net), might introduce a little more companionship into Saunders's life.</p> <p>\"It's surprising where you find social isolation,\" says Stephenson, who has been in social work since 1982. \"You can be talking to someone who, on paper, has a good support network, yet in terms of meaningful contact, they don't have a lot. I've come across so many resilient older people who have just accepted that old age means loneliness. They might live in a community, yet they are isolated from it.\"</p> <h2><strong>Quality of life</strong></h2> <p>His work with Saunders is part of a pilot scheme exploring an innovative concept that goes by the name of Combining Personalisation with Community Engagement (CPCE). If successful, it could assist councils to reduce their social care spending, help the NHS to cut hospital costs and bring investment into local communities. Most significantly, though, the scheme aims to give older people a better quality of life, enabling them to live longer independently in their own homes.</p> <p>And here's how it would work: older people who are eligible for care under the Facs (fair access to care services) system, and who wish to take a personal budget, would choose to supplement or replace the council-provided elements of their support packages with more tailored services, provided by local social enterprises and their volunteers. The money saved through using volunteers would be split between the council and the social enterprise, which would invest its share in the community.</p> <p>For Saunders, it's working like this. After completing a \"lifeplan\" \u2013 a side-and-a-half A4 summary of her needs and aspirations \u2013 Stephenson has agreed for her support package to include transport by volunteers to Garforth Net's weekly coffee morning and luncheon club. A&#xa0;volunteer will also be helping her regain confidence on her mobility scooter, while another will take her out for walks in her wheelchair. Lifeplans for other people have included weekly fishing trips, pub lunches and church visits. Saunders will also still receive personal care from a professional care worker.</p> <p>The idea belongs to the Stamford Forum, a social policy ideas network. \"This could change the shape of social care over next 10 years,\" claims Ritchard Brazil, one of the forum's founding members. \"The savings could allow local authorities to use their funds much more effectively and, more importantly, make it possible for individuals to receive better services that improve their lives.</p> <p>\"It would also free social workers to get back to doing what they are trained to do, rather than being care managers or glorified accountants.\"</p> <p>In addition to the work in Garforth, pilots are running in other parts of the UK. \"CPCE is an exciting opportunity to shift more resources to communities,\" says Mick Ward, Leeds council's head of commissioning. \"It's a chance for older people to change from being passive recipients to being in control of those resources. But it also shifts control of resources to communities which can decide how CPCE savings can be reinvested, whether that's to set up a community laundry or increase community policing.\"</p> <p>Leeds council has made cutbacks of almost \u00a3150m over the past two years and the adult social care directorate predicts a 15% reduction in spending power over the next four years. Directorate deputy director Dennis Holmes says he is expecting CPCE to deliver personal budget savings of about 5%, but believes the \"ultimate prize\" with initiatives like CPCE is \"whole system savings\" \u2013 fewer hospital and residential care admissions.</p> <p>\"Nursing and residential care is my biggest single item of expenditure \u2013 \u00a372m a year,\" says Holmes. \"If people stay in residential care for shorter periods of their life, that will generate great savings to us.\"</p> <p>The financial climate has \"sharpened our desire to find new ways of doing things,\" says Sandie Keene, Leeds's director of adult social care. But she concedes there will be challenges in extending CPCE across the city.</p> <p>\"None of us assumes this is going to be easy,\" Keene says. \"We have to build capacity in our communities and there's culture change within the local authority to overcome as well. Social workers are used to doing things a certain way. However, some might remember when social workers used to be more community-based. We need to marry up that history with the present.\"</p> <p>Brazil admits that not all local authorities are ready for CPCE \u2013 few councils, for example, have community infrastructure as mature as in Leeds. Even in Leeds, it&#xa0;has yet to be proven whether the well of volunteers from the 37 neighbourhood networks, which include Garforth Net, is&#xa0;deep enough to support CPCE in significant numbers \u2013 although Brazil maintains it will attract volunteers who see it as a&#xa0;skills ladder for entering the social care sector.</p> <p>Stephenson acknowledges that some of his social worker colleagues may struggle to embrace the new model. \"Some might fear for their jobs,\" he says, \"but social work has become more about assessing people's needs, and figuring out what support they need, instead of outcomes.</p> <p>\"I can remember working in a system that wasn't as bureaucratic and prescriptive, where you could work more flexibly. I think CPCE would allow us to be social workers again. It feels more like what we ought to be doing.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>\"Training for a marathon and reading about </strong><a href=\"http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=38667\" title=\"\"><strong>Ronnie O'Sullivan's none-too-shabby amateur running career</strong></a><strong>, some friends and I were wondering if any top-flight footballers have ever run a serious 10k or marathon and how they fared,\" </strong>writes Ben Smith. <strong>\"Any ideas?\"</strong></p> <p>The Leeds 10k in July of this year numbered among its runners several men who, while not exactly top-flight footballers, do share a pitch with them every weekend. The referees Howard Webb, Phil Dowd, Martin Atkinson, Michael Jones and Jon Moss pounded the roads of Yorkshire for charity and registered respectable times. Webb was quickest, striding home in 46min 41sec, with Jones narrowly behind in 47.34, followed by Atkinson at 47.45, a time matched by Moss, while Dowd brought up the rear in 50.04.</p> <p>Going the extra mile (or six) in October last year was the Swindon manager Paolo Di Canio, who ended up running the Swindon half-marathon by mistake. The former West Ham forward was the official starter of the race and successfully sounded the starting gun before heading off on the two-mile fun run.</p> <p>The Italian, though, took a wrong turn and ended up running the whole 13.1 miles in his full Swindon kit. \"I couldn't stop, there was a challenge,\" he said after finishing in 1hr 49min. \"There were three options, I thought I should start with the fun [run] marathon but unfortunately we changed direction, kept going and followed the first group.\"</p> <p>\"Unfortunately I ended up doing a full half marathon plus 800 metres. At the end I was very happy because I finished without stopping, even for one second. I wasn't ready but I never stopped running. I'm very happy but it was very tough.\"</p> <p>At the full 26.2 mile distance, it tends to be former footballers running for charity rather than irascible Italian managers losing their way on a fun run. Some take it rather more seriously than others and the quickest time we've been able to find in the record books is the scintillating <a href=\"http://results-2011.virginlondonmarathon.com/2011/index.php?content=detail&amp;fpid=search&amp;pid=search&amp;id=0000030F5ECC83000003567D&amp;lang=EN&amp;event=MAS&amp;ageclass=\" title=\"\">3hr 22min 36sec</a> run of the former Leicester midfielder Muzzy Izzet in the 2011 London marathon.</p> <p>\"I think I was 12 minutes off the time needed for an elite start so that is really encouraging. I was pleased with the time although I'd like to get to something like 3.08 or 3.09 if I do it again,\" <a href=\"http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Athletics-Leicester-City-star-Muzzy-Izzet-making-giant-strides-marathon-runner/story-12044298-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">he told the Leicester Mercury</a>. \"I've probably not done as much training as I thought I needed and I had a couple of weeks when I didn't do anything, so that wasn't ideal.

One that turned up was <a href=\"http://www.bokia.se/mitt-italien-pasta-och-pizza-fran-norr-till-soder-4256276\" title=\"\">'Mitt Italien', by TV football pundit and former Atalanta midfielder Glenn Str\u00f6mberg</a>.</p> <p>\"It's a selection of pasta and pizza recipes organised by region, with brief interviews and tips from other Swedes who've played in Italy (Tomas Brolin, Kennet Andersson, Jesper Blomqvist, Sven etc). And it's actually rather good \u2013 the recipe for rigatoni with ragu bolognese is fantastic \u2013 though I don't imagine an English translation is available.\"</p> <p>Alas, we couldn't find one, but here's another for the Christmas list: Sebastian Csar emailed to let us know that the former Hertha Berlin captain Arne Friedrich, now playing for Chicago Fire, co-wrote the optimistically titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3517069574\" title=\"\">\"Foodball: Cook like a world champion\"</a>. Set in soft focus photos of Friedrich chopping greens while the goateed celebrity chef Ralf Zacherl leans on a football close by, the foreword tells readers to \"Keep on rolling the football und keep on cooking!\"</p> <p>\"There is another bright example of a brilliant footballer writing about something completely different,\" writes Eberhard Spohd. \"Horst Hrubesch. The German international (21 caps, six goals), the three-times German champion, winner of the Champions Cup and the one to score both goals in the Euro final in 1980 against Belgium [are you chairman of the fan club, Eberhard?] is not only a horse breeder, he is also a great fisherman.</p> <p>\"His book <a href=\"http://img.zvab.com/member/12555d/37442322.jpg\" title=\"\">Dorschangeln vom Boot und an den K\u00fcsten [Cod fishing from a boat and the coast]</a>, which he wrote together with Dieter Schicker, also from 1980, is a classic. The book teaches the reader everything he has to know if he wants to catch cod (and its relatives of the family Gadidae) with a fishing rod.\" And having faithfully translated the link Eberhard sent in, we can tell you that Der Spiegel called it \"a classic in the fishing literature\", no less.</p> <p>\"Might I mention that famed Nobel-prize winning physicist, Niels Bohr, was a keen footballer and played in goal for his local Copenhagen team, Akademisk Boldclub.\" Yes, you might, Greg Jenner. \"His brother Harald, a noted mathematician, even represented Denmark as a footballing Olympian. Admittedly their books are not quite as readable as Carlos Puyol's culinary adventures, but they go some way to dispelling the myth that footballers are stupid.\"</p> <p>Indeed \u2013 unfortunately the Knowledge's usually excellent atomic physics is a little rusty, so no excerpts here. The same goes for The Road to Ithaca, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/21/championsleague.barcelona\" title=\"\">a book by the former Barcelona defender Oleguer Presas</a>. Tipping us off, Eoghan Kenny calls it \"wide-ranging and rather high-brow for a footballer\"; Wikipedia has it down as a series of recollections from his younger days, but the reviews describe a cross between a football story and a political manifesto, which likens Barcelona's 2005 title-winning side to Catalan fighters in the Spanish Civil War. We think.</p> <p>It certainly beats Arild Stavrum's efforts for imagination. \"I doubt they have been translated in to English,\" says Jostein Nygard, \"even with the recent flood of Scandinavian crime novels to the British market.\" Stavrum left Molde having just turned 32, and a few years later published \"31 years on the Pitch\". Here's some of the blurb: \"Joachim learned to dribble at four years old. While growing up, he had three dreams: he wanted to be the top scorer in the Norwegian Premier League, a national team player and a pro. At 31, he has achieved his goals. He has lived well by playing football for many years, but he's getting to the end of his contract at Molde FK and fears that his career is nearing its end.\" Hmm.</p> <p>Thanks also to Alex Locatelli for pointing out the Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer's series of children's books, about young footballer Edward \"Megs\" Morrison's struggles to get a soccer team going after moving to Australia. \"Will the Vootball Kids band together in the face of adversity? Can Megs remain focused on football despite some spiky issues at home? And how will the Kids perform in their first season playing competitive football?\" We're hooked \u2013 which is more than can be said for our friend Eberhard Spohd, who only started reading about cod fishing after tiring of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/Alles-Ein-fiktiver-Tatsachenroman/dp/3923838506\" title=\"\">\"Everything: A fictional historical novel\",</a> by the former German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner. \"I couldn't read it long enough to find out what it's about,\" says Eberhard. \"Too many greasy soft-porn scenes make this book unreadable.\"</p> <p>If ever there was assurance of the merits of staying in one's comfort zone, however, it surely comes in the form of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Unforgettable-Fire-Story-Eamon-Dunphy/dp/0670821047\" title=\"\">\"Unforgettable Fire, the story of U2\"</a>: written by Eamon Dunphy, eviscerated by critics, and emailed to us by Dave Bruen. Dunphy, a former Millwall, Charlton and Republic of Ireland midfielder, had already written his Diary of a Professional Footballer when he was asked by U2's manager to write about the band's early years. Though plenty of U2 fans enjoyed it, the book was variously described as \"cloying and worshipful\" and \"full of breathtaking inaccuracies\".</p> <p>After publication, Dunphy criticised the way the band had treated him, the band said he had failed to let them see the manuscript and sort out the mistakes; Dunphy called Bono a \"pompous git\", Bono reportedly called Dunphy \"rat poison\". Either way, the book took a panning.</p> <p>\"The catalogue of errors piles up until it's impossible to see beyond it,\" wrote Neil McCormack, for Hot Press. \"If what I know first-hand is so inaccurately represented (and these are not all the errors of which I'm aware, not by a long shot), then I can have no faith in any of the rest of Dunphy's storytelling. There is simply nothing I can take at face value in this book.</p> <p>\"Dunphy's not only guilty of outrageous inaccuracy, he is also grossly ill-informed on the subject that should be at the story's core: music... I filled 18 pages of a small notebook with Dunphy's errors, misrepresentations, misunderstandings and misinformed comment.</p> <p>\"Sometimes, reading this book, I get the feeling somebody's been pulling Dunphy's leg.\"</p> <h2>DELIBERATE OWN GOALS</h2> <p><strong>\"I was wondering if an own goal has ever been intentionally conceded by a player in protest or out of anger at his own club/fans/manager?\" </strong>writes Thomas Houghton.</p> <p>This is one of those bits where we find a few stories that don't quite fulfil the criteria so as to avoid leaving a blank space. There was talk that William Gallas had managed to force a move from Chelsea to Arsenal by threatening to score own goals if they made him stay but, though recent performances suggest sabotage is not beyond him, Gallas always denied the accusation. In the 1950s, Brian Clough accused his Middlesbrough team-mates of deliberately conceding goals in order to fleece the bookmakers. That (and the fact that he kept scoring enough goals to even matches up) made him an unpopular man in the dressing room.</p> <p>There have been plenty of protest own goals scored \u2013 149 in one game, in fact, but the target of the players' ire was the referee. In 2002 AS Adema beat the reigning Madagascan champions Stade Olympique de L'Emyrne 149-0 after SOE's players spent the whole game putting the ball into their own net during the final game of a round-robin title play-off. In the preceding game, SOE had been put out of the running for the title when the referee awarded a dubious late penalty with which DSA Antananarivo equalised. The coach and four players received suspensions and stadium bans, which at least spared them the agita of fans who wanted their money back.</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"Is Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach the longest team name in football?\" </strong>ask Robert Bashford and Justin Walker.</p> <p>Far from it chaps: Anglesey League team Clwb P\u00eal-droed Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch came pretty close to landing the prize with a weighty 70 letters, but Stuart Orford can do even better. \"My favourite is Dutch Eredivisie side NAC Breda,\" he begins somewhat unconvincingly. \"It expands to Nooit Opgeven Altijd Doorzetten Aangenaam Door Vermaak En Nuttig Door Ontspanning Combinatie Breda.\"</p> <p>\"I'd like to nominate my team, UCD, in the League of Ireland Premier Division,\" says Kevin Burke. \"Under some universities' act a few years ago, we officially became University College Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (81 letters). There are some who'll suggest that, with that hideous new crest, it should now (unofficially) be University College Dublin Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (87 letters). This would translate into Irish as Cumann Sacair Ollscoil na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, Ollscoil N\u00e1isi\u00fanta na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, which is 102 letters and a comma.\"</p> <p>Not bad, Kevin, but a rival school of learning trumps it. \"I think you'd have to go some to beat the full name in Thai of Bangkok University FC,\" claims Liam O'Brien. \"This would include the longest place name in the world, using the official Thai name for Bangkok.

That of Thai Pro League side Bangkok Bravo. \"Should they ever wish to refer to themselves by their full (English translated) name,\" notes Dale Farrington, \"they would be called: Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit Bravo Association Football Club (196 characters).

  "<p>Tesco has more than 12 million Clubcard customers. These shoppers unwittingly provide Tesco with around 5bn items of data every week, which Tesco sells on to commercial companies for more than \u00a350m a year. Tesco knows exactly who you are, where you live, what you like \u2013 and what you don't like. When it promotes a new product, the supermarket chain can target it to the precise postcodes where they know it is likely to do well.</p> <p>In contrast, housing providers know very little about their tenants. The recent consultation over whether <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/paytostayconsultation\" title=\"\">tenants should \"pay to stay\"</a> revealed that housing associations don't know, and don't appear to want to know, what their tenants earn. Some providers don't even know who is living in some of their properties.</p> <p>I'm not suggesting we follow the Tesco approach, but as a sector we could do better. With the dramatic changes now facing us, not least welfare reform, it is crucial that we have a better understanding of our tenants' needs and aspirations. If nothing else, a failure to understand and address the personal circumstances of our tenants could lead to a huge increase in rent arrears once universal credit and the bedroom tax kick in.</p> <p>One landlord that is planning ahead is Cross Keys Homes in Peterborough. Its \"resident census\" has amassed an impressive database of information about 96% of tenant households. Neighbourhood managers visit each tenant and conduct a face-to-face interview that lasts around 90 minutes, using touchscreen tablet computers to collect data. The information collated includes household size, income, any disabilities, internet access, bank accounts, willingness to be involved in resident panels and training schemes, and the household's economic aspirations. The visit also includes a detailed property inspection to check for repairs, sub-letting or overcrowding.</p> <p>The driving force behind the project at Cross Keys is director of operations, Claire Higgins. By collecting a full profile of who is living in their homes, the housing association has been able to change the way frontline staff work with tenants.</p> <p>She told me: \"This is helping to drive the organisation forward and make detailed plans on issues like welfare reform. That is a fantastic use of their time and it means that we are really well placed to respond to government agendas on localism and citizenship. For example, we can identify those young people eligible for the national citizenship scheme as well as those community stalwarts willing to become community organisers. The census also allows us to deal with problems before they get out of hand and to map where we need to take action on those issues that are important to our residents, such as anti-social behaviour.\"</p> <p>All the information gathered by staff is then downloaded to Cross Keys' housing management database, which helps staff to target services and information to precisely the right people. The team now knows exactly who is affected by the bedroom tax and can offer bespoke advice about the forthcoming reductions in housing benefit. They can also provide targeted support to help tenants gain entry to a training course and into employment.</p> <p>Higgins describes the survey as a tool that has allowed the organisation to \"dig more deeply\" into the causes of problems on estates. Her conclusion? \"I would recommend this process to any other landlord who is interested in planning for a viable future.\"</p> <p><em>Colin Wiles is a housing consultant.
