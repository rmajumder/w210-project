  "<p>A global medical charity is calling for drones to be included in international arms limitations treaties, arguing that on top of the physical harm they wreak they also inflict psychological harm \u2013 both when they strike and by causing innocent people to live in fear.</p> <p>A report by <a href=\"http://www.medact.org/\" title=\"\">Medact</a>, whose members are health professionals, says there are many reasons to be concerned about the increasing use of unmanned, armed drones.</p> <p>It says: \"In addition to the number of deaths and injuries of innocent civilians, we also have concerns about the psychological damage to people living under the constant threat of drone attack and to service personnel who carry out the assassinations.</p> <p>\"There is also some evidence that medical personnel and others who arrive at the scene to assist the injured have been targeted in drone attacks. This is a war crime.\"</p> <p>The most accurate figures on the numbers of civilians killed by drones are from Pakistan, says the report, and they range from light casualties to the large estimates of deaths, including those of children, family members attending funerals and medical personnel, provided by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The Bureau says that between 2,985 and 4,533 civilians have died since 2001 in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.</p> <p>Injuries, says Medact, are fewer than deaths, which is unusual in a conflict.</p> <p>\"While more injuries than deaths probably go unreported, this nevertheless gives an indication of the deadly nature of drone attacks and the unnecessary deaths that will occur if mistakes are made in targeting, observation or intelligence gathering,\" says the report.</p> <p>\"The deaths and injuries suffered by innocent civilians in what are euphemistically called 'surgical strikes' are often underreported.\"</p> <p>Women are disproportionately affected by drones, it adds. \"What little control they have over their lives is further eroded by a weapon they know could strike at any time.\"</p> <p>By the end of last month, Britain had carried out more than 300 drone strikes in Afghanistan. There are plans to double the UK's fleet and to open a second control station at RAF Waddington in late 2012, says Medact, which challenges the legitimacy of what it calls asymmetrical warfare.</p> <p>Marion Birch, director of Medact and a co-author of the report, said: \"Drones are not only unacceptable from a human, moral and legal point of view, they are traumatising families and damaging the chances of peace. We believe it is time for the UK government to stop purchasing, developing and deploying armed drones.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hamid Bouadimi leaves the sitting room of his south London flat and returns holding a green plastic bag. Labelled \"patient property\" and tied with a knot, it contains the clothes that his five-year-old son, Hichame, was wearing when he was killed by a lorry on&#xa0;St George's Road, Southwark, on the way home from school last Wednesday.</p> <p>He sits down and takes out the items one by one to show to me. First a red sweatshirt bearing the community primary school's logo, then neatly folded trousers, a sticker bearing a smiley face Hichame earned through good behaviour that day, which police or paramedics have placed in a plastic bag. His little vest, socks and pants are there too. And the black school shoes that both parents took him to buy just a week ago.</p> <p>Hichame's mother has barely slept since she watched her youngest child die in the street. Mr Bouadimi, who has health problems, says he is doing his best to keep the family going. Their youngest daughter, Lamia, is back at Charlotte Sharman school on the other side of St George's Road, the three-lane red route west from Elephant and Castle, where flowers and candles have been left with messages of condolence. The couple's two teenage sons have not been back to school since the funeral.</p> <p>Transport for London removed pedestrian guard rails from the junction where Hichame was killed in March. The cause of the crash is not yet clear and the driver involved was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, but the family is looking for answers.</p> <p>\"I was always scared of that road,\" says Mr Bouadimi. \"Most of the drivers drive fast, and if the police put a camera there they would see it. The school is very close to the main road, and I don't know who was the clever man who made the decision to take away the barriers. It's really upsetting to be honest with you. My son is gone but I'm really worried. There has to be a camera and a flashing sign showing kids coming out from school, at least at 9 o'clock and 3.30. It's&#xa0;not complicated to do, it's just a&#xa0;sign. I&#xa0;don't want anybody else to experience what I've experienced.\"</p> <p>Tragedies like this are thankfully far rarer than they were in the 1980s, when more than 5,000 people were killed on Britain's roads every year (around 100 a week). In 1999 Britain had the safest roads in Europe apart from Sweden. But there are signs that such disasters \u2013 with human consequences that will reach down the years, for how does a six-year-old girl in an already vulnerable household cope with seeing her little brother's life obliterated? \u2013 are on the rise.</p> <p>The number of people killed on Britain's roads increased by 3% in 2011, to 1,901 \u2013 the first increase since 2003. The number of pedestrians killed jumped by 12% to 453, with the biggest increases among children and the over-60s \u2013 \"vulnerable road users\", in the jargon.</p> <p>Whether this is a statistical glitch, or the start of a deadly new trend, is a matter for debate. The first quarter of 2012 also showed an 8% increase (compared with the same period last year) in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured, but not all the numbers move in the same direction. While the number of casualties on motorways and in non-built-up areas fell last year, serious injuries in built-up areas went up. Road accident data are complicated.</p> <p>What is not in question is that road safety has moved up the political agenda. In February the Times launched its Cyclesafe \"Cities fit for cycling\" campaign, after its reporter Mary Bowers was critically injured in a collision with a lorry. Cycling was a big issue in London's mayoral election. \"Boris bikes\" were among the Conservative mayor's flagship first-term achievements: his rivals queued up to challenge him with statistics that showed pedestrian and cyclist deaths had gone up since he took office.</p> <p>\"It's interesting that when a cyclist is killed in London now, it's in the Evening Standard and attracts quite a bit of coverage, when in the past that wasn't the case,\" says transport writer Christian Wolmar, who aims to be Labour's mayoral candidate in 2016. \"There has traditionally been a lot of cycling in places like Cambridge, York and Chelmsford. But London, almost by accident, has become a cycling city. It's come from the bottom up, and transport planners and politicians are playing catch-up. They have still not recognised that if you have a lot of cyclists it requires the transfer of road space.\"</p> <p>Last week the Association of British Insurers called for new restrictions on young drivers, noting that one in three of those killed on the roads is under 25. It proposed a ban on night-time driving, a minimum learning period of a year and a lower drink-drive limit. Road-safety campaigners and charities such as Brake and Living Streets are united behind efforts to improve provision for cyclists and reduce dangerous driving. But they worry that pedestrians, a less organised group than cyclists and lacking Olympic celebrities such as Victoria Pendleton to take their side, struggle to command the same attention, even in a fortnight that saw a 12-year-old boy killed by a hit-and-run driver in Bradford and a 15-year-old left in a coma in west London, as well as the death of Hichame Bouadimi.</p> <p>Deaths of older pedestrians, 184 of whom were killed on Britain's roads last year, usually command even less attention. Josie Keogh's mother, Mary Daly, was killed by a speeding driver near her home in Slough in January 2010. \"She was walking on the pavement by a&#xa0;semi-main road and a man in a BMW mounted the pavement. He lost control, the car completely turned around and ended up facing the other way. He was charged with careless driving,\" she says.&#xa0;Mrs Keogh appealed against the charge and the sentence of community service and a one-year ban from driving without success.</p> <p>\"My mum was 80, but very fit. She walked everywhere. But I found that, because of her age, her death was trivialised. It was devastating. I was speaking to my mum 30 minutes before she was killed. She had five children and 11 grandchildren, and even now it's still devastating for us that that happened to her. That she was walking down the road and a car mounted the pavement and killed her. It's hard to explain how you feel \u2013 the shock and the loss \u2013 because it was completely unnecessary.\"</p> <p>Former transport secretary Justine Greening blamed variations in the weather for 2011's figures, with increased use of mobile devices highlighted as another cause of worsening safety. A handful of high-profile cases have seen drivers jailed for killing people while using mobile phones.</p> <p>But some experts believe the government bears responsibility for the worsening situation. On his first day in the job as transport secretary in May 2010, Philip Hammond made a speech in which he said, \"We will end the war on motorists. Motoring has got to get greener, but the car is not going to go away.\"</p> <p>Funding for speed cameras \u2013 famously loathed by David Cameron's Cotswolds neighbour and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson \u2013 was withdrawn. A clampdown on \"cowboy clampers\" was announced. National casualty-reduction targets were dropped. An 80mph speed limit on motorways was proposed. A department for transport spokesman says: \"An impact assessment is being carried out and a consultation will take place later this year.\"</p> <p>Oliver Carsten, professor of transport safety at the University of Leeds, and the RAC Foundation's Professor Stephen Glaister believe this change in tone sent a dangerous signal. \"Either the central message is about being careful and watchful, or it is that speed is not so salient, so maybe it's OK to go a little bit faster,\" Carsten says. \"And very small increases in speed can have a very dramatic impact when there are crashes.\"</p> <p>Glaister says he was \"appalled when the government encouraged the idea that speed cameras were not useful. Over the years there has been improving compliance with speed limits. Violations have reduced, and this is associated with a reduction in casualties. But most recent data shows both casualties and speeds have gone up. Any road-safety person would say there is a direct correlation.\" Oxfordshire, one of the first local authorities to turn its speed cameras off&#xa0;after the coalition was elected, last year turned them back on.</p> <p>Campaigners continue to push for stronger enforcement. The government has promised to get tougher on drink and drug drivers and make careless driving a fixed-penalty offence, but says there will be no return to national targets.</p> <p>Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of victims' charity Roadpeace, believes the evidence shows the justice system is moving in the wrong direction, away from taking road deaths seriously. A recent consultation by the director of public prosecutions suggested police responding to 999 calls and drivers who had killed their \"nearest and dearest\" through dangerous driving might not in&#xa0;future be prosecuted.</p> <p>\"With fatal crashes, causing death by careless driving is now the most common charge laid. They're just going for easier options where drivers can plead guilty and get banned for a year. Death by dangerous driving charges have more than halved in the past three years, since the less serious charge of careless driving was introduced. The police, the courts, prosecutors, are all under pressure to go for the cheaper, faster option.\"</p> <p>Across Britain, the approach to the street environment is changing. Towns&#xa0; and cities including Liverpool, Sheffield and Leicester have adopted a speed limit of 20mph in residential areas. The idea gaining ground is that segregation of road users may not be the solution \u2013 that drivers are more careful when made to be aware of their surroundings. There have been experiments with \"shared space\", and street \"clutter\" has become unfashionable. Transport for London has removed more than 80km of guard railings, with Edinburgh set to follow suit.</p> <p>But road safety is not always an exact&#xa0;science. As street designer John Dales explains, a road with no cycling casualties might appear safe from the statistics, when in fact cyclists are too scared to use it. \"The one thing we know&#xa0;empirically is that the slower the cars, the lower the accident statistics.\"</p> <p>Dalila Bouadimi stayed with friends for two days after her son's death, unwilling to come home, and now wants the family to move. The bedroom Hichame shared with his sister is empty. Lamia is sleeping on a mattress in a room with her older brothers.</p> <p>\"She's lonely, she thinks something is missing and she keeps talking about him all the time,\" says Mr Bouadimi. \"They were close ages, very good friends. At school on Monday she&#xa0;came out at break and started looking for him in the playground because she forgot he passed away, she was calling out his name, and the teacher said: 'No, no \u2026 it's OK, OK.'\"</p> <p>When I leave his home, Mr Bouadimi says I&#xa0;must make sure to write in my article how kind the teachers, police and&#xa0;ambulance staff have all been to&#xa0;his&#xa0;family.</p> <h2>Road deaths on the rise: the numbers</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>12% </strong>\u2013 increase in drink driving between 2010 and 2011</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>8.3m</strong> \u2013 number of people in living in places with 20mph speed limit</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>12%</strong> \u2013 rise in pedestrian deaths between 2010 and 2011</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>1901</strong> \u2013 number of people killed on British roads last year</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>184</strong> \u2013 pedestrians aged 60+ killed last year</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>201</strong> \u2013 prosecutions for dangerous driving in 2010</p>",
  "<p>It had been difficult to locate much optimism in Dublin beforehand about the Republic of Ireland's chances against the second-best team in world football. Never mind the chastening experiences of the Euro 2012 finals, when Giovanni Trapattoni's squad departed Poland battered and bowed, their World Cup qualification campaign had begun with them dodging a bullet in Kazakhstan. The late 2-1 victory was hugely fortuitous.</p> <p>There was no escape here in what represented a new low for the under-pressure Trapattoni. All of the pre-match fears were realised in brutal fashion as Germany, despite a slow start, purred through the gears to visit humiliation on Ireland. Marco Reus was the destroyer in chief, his first-half goals ending the game as a contest and begging the question that had always felt central to the occasion: by how many would Germany prevail?</p> <p>The second-half came to resemble a training exercise. The outstanding Mesut Ozil, Miroslav Klose and the substitute Toni Kroos got the goals \u2013 Kroos' pair were rattled in from distance \u2013 and it was a dismal experience for everyone connected to the Irish set-up. The minutes ticked like hours and the atmosphere, which had been vibrant at the start, when Ireland actually looked compact and committed, turned sour.</p> <p>It was the scale of the capitulation that was most worrying and Trapattoni has work to do to lift morale before Tuesday's tie in the Faroe Islands. It feels as if his job will be on the line. The Italian has shaped his Irish adventure upon defensive resilience but there was nothing here after the half hour, Germany cutting through them almost at will. Trapattoni's team have now conceded 16 times in five competitive ties and this was the heaviest home defeat in Irish football history. The substitute Andy Keogh's injury-time goal was the most hollow of consolations.</p> <p>Jon Walters, who started as the lone striker in a new-look Trapattoni formation, was perhaps the solitary positive and he caught the mood when he described the performance as \"embarrassing\".</p> <p>\"We let ourselves down, the manager down and we let the country down,\" he said. \"We can't be anything but apologetic.\"</p> <p>Trapattoni remained defiant, insisting his players would pick themselves up. He dismissed the suggestion that his time in the job was up; that he had run out of ideas to motivate the players. He said that he would fight on because he was \"proud\".</p> <p>It was ominous, though, that he spent a significant portion of his post-match briefing talking up his achievements in qualifying for Euro 2012 and, also, the very near miss at the 2010 World Cup. He reminded his audience of Ireland's state when he took over in 2008 and the amount of players he had developed. Nobody is criticising what he did up to the European Championship. It is what happened at them and since that is of deep concern. The future is fraught.</p> <p>Trapattoni had been forced to make sweeping changes as Ireland started for the first time in 15 years without Shay Given, Damien Duff, Richard Dunne or Robbie Keane. The first two have retired; the other two injured. With problems elsewhere, Trapattoni named only four players from the line-up that had started the final group tie of the failed Euro 2012 campaign against Italy. He prizes experience and continuity. The upheaval and lack of established international alternatives made him nervous.</p> <p>Joachim L\u00f6w, the Germany manager, could afford to start Kroos and Lukas Podolski on the substitutes' bench and omit Mario G\u00f6tze entirely. His team dictated the tempo and although they did not threaten until past the 30 minute mark, when they did, the tie turned sharply.</p> <p>Ireland's defensive concentration lapsed in shocking fashion when John O'Shea lost possession to Reus and then seemed to drag down the winger inside the penalty area. Surprisingly, the referee, Nicola Rizzoli, booked Reus for diving. The German had has his revenge in the next attack. Bastian Schweinsteiger's floated ball invited Marcel Schmelzer to maraud into the box and, when the ball broke, Reus shot high into the net.</p> <p>Germany's second brimmed with quality. They played the ball out from the back, under pressure and, once Ozil had dipped his shoulder and glided away from James McCarthy, the alarm bells sounded loudly. Ozil moved possession to the right-back J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, he played it across the field for the advancing Reus and his low left-footed drive billowed the far corner of the net.</p> <p>Trapattoni made an attacking change in the 51st minute, bringing on Shane Long for Keith Fahey but the home crowd's mood was killed shortly afterwards when Darren O'Dea, already on a yellow card, cut recklessly through Klose inside the area. Ozil's penalty was ice-cool.</p> <p>Klose's goal came after he rounded Keiren Westwood and threaded home from a seemingly impossible angle while Kroos's shooting oozed power and conviction. His first, a vicious left-footed volley, was the goal of the tie but his second ran it close. Trapattoni could only admit to his team's \"inferiority.\"</p> <p>\"Usually, we are more aggressive,\" he said. \"But after 30 minutes, we were without strength or energy. We had no direction.\"</p> <p>The fear is that Trapattoni will not rediscover it.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome back, then, Wayne Rooney. Captain, goalscorer, chief creator and senior man. Little wonder, perhaps, that Rooney, in his latest incarnation as international factotum-in-chief, found himself surrounded by at least four San Marino players pretty much every time he picked up the ball at Wembley on a night of unrelenting and often monotonous attack versus defence.</p> <p>As England wrestled awkwardly at times against opponents who defended with some resilience for the entire 90 minutes, it was Rooney who provided the game's most encouraging moments, most notably in scoring twice in a 5-0 victory to reach 31 England goals, putting him fifth in the all time scoring charts behind Michael Owen, Jimmy Greaves, Gary Lineker and Bobby Charlton.</p> <p>This was some way short of the bravura display of attacking generalship Roy Hodgson might have been hoping to draw from a player who remains, more so than for any of his previous England managers, a rather smudged and dog-eared trump card. But there was some small encouragement to be taken here on what was \u2013 as is customary for a man whose England career threatens to disintegrate into a succession of comebacks \u2013 another comeback of sorts. Injured against the Ukraine at Wembley last month and peripheral in the Ukraine this summer, England's stand-in captain had spoken with some maturity during the week about the need to show maturity, shown leadership on the issue of leadership and generally talked up his own credentials as a sober head among the current tyro squad.</p> <p>This was a team set up to play to his strengths. After the variations on 4-4-2 that have been the template for 'Early Hodgson', England lined up in a fashionable 4-2-3-1 formation, with Rooney in the middle of the three, performing a hard-running, hyperactive, anglicised variation on the No10 role. From there he went pretty much where he wanted in a skewed first-half of occasionally frantic, occasionally meandering attack against blanket defence. It was Rooney's early hooked pass over his shoulder into Theo Walcott's path that created the first chance after six minutes, Walcott failing to reach the ball but finding himself felled inside the area by San Marino goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini's scandalous flying body-check assault, which should have brought both a penalty and a red card.</p> <p>Still Rooney continued to drift in search of space against opponents ill-equipped to follow his movement, instead adopting a shifting wall of blue around the edge of their own area, not so much zonal defence as the Saturday afternoon in Sainsbury's approach, forming a dense blockage across a narrow band of the Wembley turf that stifled England's attempts to play the kind of neat, penetrative short-passing football that, in truth, often eludes them.</p> <p>The game's first corner after 12 minutes saw Rooney skim a header narrowly wide when he should have scored. And so he began to drop deeper, often an indication that all is not well, and, for some, a sign that he lacks the patience to exploit some of the more soft-pedalled aspects of the second striker's role: the refusal to be drawn to the ball, the ability just to stand still for a bit now and then.</p> <p>England, for all their perspiration, were getting closer, and the pressure duly told as Danny Welbeck was tripped by Simoncini receiving the ball after a fine angled-run inside the area. Rooney took the penalty the way likes to \u2013 hitting it with power to the goalkeeper's right and using his instep to find the corner. Wembley, for all the false starts, the trapped revs, the spluttering on the launch pad of his middle years, still loves him, and briefly the chants of \"Roo-ney!\" rang around from all sides.</p> <p>Albeit, Rooney could scarcely have hoped for more accommodating opposition. There is a fair case to say San Marino, joint-bottom of the Fifa rankings, are probably the worst team he has ever played against (Crawley, Exeter and Shrewsbury would fancy their chances) and in truth two goals here confirmed that Rooney has become something of a Hammer of the Minnows at international level. In the last four years he has scored against Kazakhstan Belarus, Slovakia, Andorra Croatia Switzerland Bulgaria and Ukraine, while only two of his 29 goals overall have come against opponents currently in Fifa's top-10.</p> <p>For now, though, never mind the quality. As San Marino wearied in the second-half, the thick blue line dropping deeper and deeper, Rooney continued to play wherever his instincts took him. His second goal was an agreeably explosive affair; a loose ball sent curling low into the far corner, to take him clear of Nat Lofthouse, Sir Tom Finney and Alan Shearer in the all-time stakes.</p> <p>Only San Marino, perhaps, but for Rooney the night had a rehabilitative feel. Poland will provide a far sterner test in Warsaw, but as he left the field to a standing ovation here there was still a sense, dimly, of a first significant step taken under his fourth full-time manager for England's new junior senior&#xa0;man.</p>",
  "<p>To get to Samar Yazbek's flat in an area of Paris she would prefer remained unnamed, a guest needs three codes: for a metal gate around the building, an outer door and an inner door. Eventually, sensing my bafflement with this final hurdle \u2013 she is guiding me in by mobile phone, her English fails her, and I do not understand Arabic \u2013 she comes down to rescue me. Her handshake is warm, her gaze long and direct, an unabashed moment of examination.</p> <p>It is a wary way for a novelist to behave, but then she is an unusual sort of&#xa0;novelist, and her latest book is not a novel. A Woman in the Crossfire is a diary, a feverish, nightmarish, immediate account of four months in the middle of last year, which she spent demonstrating against the Assad regime in Syria, until the threats and intimidation made it impossible. She then moved with her daughter from flat to flat, never quite ahead of the security forces, who detained her five times. She interviewed protesters, doctors, neighbours and defectors about what was happening in the streets, prisons and hospitals of her country, what they saw and what was done to them, often finding that after they had talked to her, they disappeared. She never pretends that she is being heroic, although her persistence sometimes feels foolhardy. This week the book was awarded the PEN Pinter Prize, given annually to a British writer who, as Harold Pinter put it in his Nobel speech, casts an \"unflinching, unswerving\" gaze upon the world (this year, Carol Ann Duffy), and shared with an international writer who has been persecuted for speaking out about their beliefs. It is drenched in fear and grief. She chain-smokes, weeps and screams through it, and cannot sleep without tranquillisers.</p> <p>How has it been received in the Middle East? Yazbek has enough English to understand my questions. She nods, and begins to speak in Arabic, making forceful eye contact, willing me to understand, before turning to the translator. The book is samizdat in Syria, which has not stopped the government denouncing her as immoral and it as full of lies, and for some Syrian intellectuals to agree with them and follow suit. But in other areas, she says, it has been gratefully received, as an eyewitness account of what really happened at the beginning of the uprising.</p> <p>\"I want to smoke, if you don't mind,\" says Yazbek, lighting up. Tawny eyes look out from between sheets of tawny hair, the bright gaze and pointed face of a fox. There is one bedroom, which has gone to her 18-year-old daughter. Yazbek sleeps behind a screen in the corner of the living room.</p> <p>Yazbek comes from an Alawite family that used to be among the grandest and wealthiest on the Syrian coast. She also has, she points out wryly in her book, a&#xa0;familial link to Osama bin Laden \u2013 a relative of her mother's was his first wife. President Assad is an Alawite too, but, \"it&#xa0;was one of the achievements of Assad that the big, rich families of the Alawite clan either worked with him or became middle-class\". Which is not to say that her family opposed him: she will not give any details about them \u2013 not the number of her siblings, nor what her parents do, because she doesn't want to put them in any more danger than she already has.</p> <p>It was an ordinary life, very protected, not particularly cultured, loving and affectionate. But she was a rebellious child, and from very early on could not understand why she should have different life expectations from her brothers. She says that Syrian women have the best conditions in the Middle East after Tunisia. But \"it seemed that when Hafez al-Assad was president he&#xa0;was accomplishing reforms, but in reality, in profound ways, it was getting worse, going backward.\" And things did not improve under his son, Bashar.</p> <p>\"The real revolution will begin after the fall of Assad,\" she says. \"Then we will have a feminist revolution to construct a new life, a new education, build a new society.\" But aren't you afraid of unintended consequences? Of the influx of Islamists, or of mirroring Egypt and Libya? \"If we are afraid of the religious impact, we need to work from <em>now</em> to help in the revolution, to be able, after, to rebuild.\"</p> <p>When she was 16, she ran away. \"I&#xa0;wanted to be liberated, I always felt caught \u2026 like all teenagers, you know?\" she says in English. \"But I actually did it. And it's horrible in our society \u2013 it's a shame for the family, for the girl \u2013 many people want to kill their daughters. Everyone thought I wanted to be with a man, but it's not true \u2013 I wanted to be alone, I wanted to make my own future, I wanted to be a writer.\" Again, she doesn't want to talk much about it, because \"I feel sorry about my family, and I feel guilty, because I have always made trouble for them\". Her novels, which speak of women's lives, or Alawite families and their cosy relationship with the military, which are unashamedly erotic and deal with lesbian relationships, were bad enough from their point of view. But since her involvement in the uprising, when she was officially branded a traitor to her own kind, and leaflets were distributed in the streets encouraging her annihilation, no one speaks to her family. \"They think my brothers are not men because they didn't kill me.\" She writes in her book how one of these brothers contemplated suicide, so great was the shame. \"A&#xa0;woman like me,\" she writes drily, \"makes life difficult.\"</p> <p>They took her back, but when she was 19 she ran away again. She lived alone for a short while, then married in a civil ceremony, moved to Cyprus and had a baby. The entrance phone rings, on cue: \"That's my daughter now.\" After four years, she left her husband and moved, with her two-year-old, to Damascus.</p> <p>\"Bonjour!\" Having to flee interrupted her schooling, so her daughter is learning French and will tackle the baccalaureate in six months' time. She is tall, confident, watchful, and seems to be enjoying the international nature of her Parisian school. But in the book her mother describes how every Friday last year she locked the doors of their flat and wept, begging her mother to stay home instead of demonstrating: \"Don't go! I know where you're going!\". They bicker and bicker, they curl up together on a bed, and cry themselves to sleep; an hour later Yazbek wakes to pace and smoke. She gets daily threatening phone&#xa0;calls; this regime takes her position personally.</p> <p>All her daughter's classmates in her Damascus school stopped speaking to her. They wrote terrible things on her Facebook page, and she had to leave everything she loved behind. \"Yeah, I'm proud of her,\" she says of her mother. \"But I think, me, I have another mind. I'm not like her. I don't like to have a lot of problems just for revolution. You could have a calm life. I was happy without a revolution.\"</p> <p>\"You can understand,\" says Yazbek. \"She's angry.\"</p> <p>One Friday, back in Syria, a man came to see Yazbek and told her to flee because she was on a hit list of Alawite figures. Her daughter \"turned yellow, went to her room and slammed the door\". Later that day she demanded that her mother go on TV and proclaim her loyalty to the president, which she refused to do. It was when Yazbek was detained for the third time and threats were made against her daughter that she decided she had to leave. \"For the first time,\" she writes, \"I&#xa0;put my daughter first.\"</p> <p>Damascus had been hard. At first, before Yazbek's novels were published, and before she became well known as a TV presenter, documentary-maker and journalist, she lived in one room just outside the city, working in admin for 12&#xa0;hours a day, keeping herself and her daughter just above the poverty line, refusing family connections because she didn't want to owe them anything.</p> <p>It was then that she began to carry a&#xa0;flick-knife to defend herself, which came in handy last year, when security forces came to her home, blindfolded her&#xa0;and took her to a commanding officer&#xa0;in a place she did not recognise. He grabbed her wrists so tightly they burned, she writes, and hit her so hard she fell to the ground and stayed there. The third time he hit her, she took out the knife and he backed away, but it did&#xa0;not stop him from demanding she recant and fall into line with her kind. Two men took her on a tour of the cells, as a warning: she saw three young men, \"their hands hanging from metal clamps, and the tips of their toes barely touching the ground\". They pushed her forward, and one raised his head. \"There was a blank space where his nose should be, no&#xa0;lips.\" More cells, a young man with his back split open, bodies stacked behind bodies, terrible sounds, terrible sights, terrible smells.</p> <p>\"It's a revolution of the poor against the&#xa0;rich, but as they began killing people and got increasingly cruel, more people are joining the rebellion,\" she says. It doesn't matter that she is from a privileged background, and has little in common with many of those fighting. \"It's a problem of conscience. It's not a problem of Sunni, Shiite or anything else.\"</p> <p>She reiterates this later. \"It's not a sectarian war. It's a revolution. The regime makes it a sectarian crime between the people. It's not true.</p> <p>\"There is a big risk, now, for the revolution \u2013 they are confronting much more repression. It's dividing the societies in Syria and the opposition is becoming much more cruel.\"</p> <p>Is she losing hope of establishing the structures of civil society? \"I don't think all hope is gone. I think there are many in Syrian society who are working to keep the civil institutions. We are at a very risky point \u2026 I'm afraid that if the world doesn't help the Syrian people now, and help to make the regime fall, Syria will be in great danger. If we get rid of Assad today, not tomorrow, it would help us to build the country normally.</p> <p>\"That is my hope and also my fear, because Assad takes strength from Iran, from Russia and from the non-reaction of&#xa0;Europeans and Americans. There is a complicity with Assad in the west, even if it's not official, or said, or clear. But they are helping him to stay. And that is very dangerous for the Syrian&#xa0;people.\"</p> <p>Yazbek had to get her ex-husband's permission to take her daughter away to France. At first she felt guilt, and a deep betrayal of herself. \"Leaving Syria,\" she writes, \"means death and nothing else.

  "<p>Should we have known? With hindsight there were plenty of clues. Katie had always been something of a tomboy \u2013 never a \"girly\" girl and most definitely not a Barbie girl \u2013 and we had begun to suspect that there was a possibility that, as adolescence progressed, she might turn out to be attracted to women rather than men. After all, my side of the family had previous form in this respect, so it crossed our minds and we did joke about it.</p> <p>About two or three weeks before the bombshell dropped, an overheated dinner-table discussion (nothing unusual about that) erupted between Katie and Cass, my wife, about transgendered people and sexuality. It started with Katie talking about the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/07/2\" title=\"\">Boys Don't Cry</a>, which she had seen recently. Katie seemed unusually animated by the issues and engaged in a discussion about the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation.</p> <p>She exclaimed that she was astounded that her mother didn't know the difference; she did, but 15-year-olds in the heat of an argument are difficult to convince at the best of times. As the argument came to a head, Cass glared across the table and demanded of Katie whether there was&#xa0;something she needed to tell us. There was a slight pause, then a defiant&#xa0;\"no\" and we finished the meal in glum silence.</p> <p>It must have been a few days later that Katie confided in Josh, her 14-year-old brother, that she no longer wished to be a girl and intended to start the transition towards becoming a boy. Two weeks later she plucked up the courage to tell her mother.</p> <p>It must have been extremely difficult for Katie to speak to Cass about it, and it is to her credit that she did. When Cass passed the news on to me a few hours later, I was stunned but felt I had to go and say something to Katie. Perhaps I should have waited.</p> <p>When I went into the study where she was doing a routine stint on Facebook, all I could think of to say was something along the lines of \"Mum told me your news \u2013 it was really brave of you, and I'm proud of you.\" I gave her a hug, then added an excruciatingly embarrassing Dad joke along the lines of \"but please ask before you borrow my razor\".</p> <p>Within seconds I felt I'd been clumsy and naff, but I'm not sure how better I could have done it. Then Cass and I hit the internet to do some research.</p> <p>Gender dysphoria (also known as transgenderism, gender identity disorder or gender incongruence) is the medical term for the feeling that one's biology and gender identity are mismatched. Although still classified as a mental-health problem, increasingly the professional's view is that the root causes are likely to be organic, prompted by genetic predisposition or overexposure to particular hormones in the womb or both. For the person with the condition, it feels as if they are trapped in a body of the wrong sex.</p> <p>One can only imagine the anxiety and discomfort this can produce, and the fear that the person is, somehow, not quite right. The NHS estimates that about one in 4,000 people seeks help with gender dysphoria but suggests there may be many more who do not.</p> <p>On average, men are diagnosed with gender dysphoria five times more than women. Treatment may involve help to come to terms with the condition by means of dress and lifestyle, or result in hormone therapy and surgical intervention. It is often the case that pre-pubescent children who feel such dysphoria find it resolves itself before puberty. For those who enter adulthood with these feelings, the most common outcome is hormone treatment and surgery to alter their biological sex.</p> <p>For adolescents under 18, the NHS process of treatment involves initial referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and then, most likely, to a specialist gender-identity clinic. There are 10 NHS adult&#xa0;gender-identity clinics in the UK but only one for children and adolescents \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.tavistockandportman.nhs.uk/childrenyoungpeoplegenderidentityissues\" title=\"\">the Gender Identity Development Service at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust in London</a>. The relative rarity of the condition and information about support for it on the NHS all pointed to the likely probability of a protracted encounter with the medical profession.</p> <p>We went to see our GP who, indeed, referred us to the local CAMHS, and they, in turn, after one consultation, referred Katie to the Gender Identity Development Service.</p> <p>After the initial shock, my first feeling was one of grief. I was losing a daughter. She would, in time, become a son and no doubt be the same annoying but lovable teenager she is now. Nevertheless, the feeling that she was someone leaving us was palpable. For me, this feeling subsided in the days that passed, but for Cass it persists and is the cause of seemingly endless torment.</p> <p>There is a complication for Cass, in relation to her religious beliefs, though I must stress that \"complication\" is my term and perspective, not hers.</p> <p>I have reversed the situation in my mind: if Josh were to become Josie, would the impact on me be more severe? I find it impossible to judge even this hypothetical situation. My overriding urge is to protect and support, but without encouraging a headlong charge into anything quick or irreversible in the near future.</p> <p>Case histories and the statistics on young people who transition mostly offer a range of accounts between the sobering and the alarming. There are some good news stories about successful transitions and happy lives, but equally there are many of anguish, pain, mental distress, self-harm and suicide. The key factor in determining good outcomes, it seems, is good levels of support from friends, family and health professionals.</p> <p>The weeks after Katie's revelation were a rollercoaster of emotions. At the tail end of the Olympics, Katie and I went to London for the day to see an exhibition and go to Camden market. We had lunch and dinner in restaurants where, on both occasions, the waitress asked if \"you gentlemen\" would like dessert. To me, Katie is a girl trying to look like a young man, but to most other people she is just a young man. Afterwards, when I remarked on this and said it seemed a bit weird, she said, \"Don't worry, Dad. It seems a bit strange to me too.\"</p> <p>This situation has made me appreciate that we are fortunate to live where, and when, we do. Katie has just begun her A-levels at sixth form college and it was her wish to make a new start there with her new identity. Having filled in her application form as Katie, it was a mere administrative amendment to alter her name to Ben.</p> <p>The college provided a sympathetic student tutor to chat things over with Katie, and that was that. At a pre-term student induction meeting Katie gravitated towards a group of boys and found immediate acceptance, though whether they knew I don't know and didn't ask. Interestingly, Katie's (Ben's) only comment was that boys seem to indulge in less inconsequential chat than girls, and that she found this refreshing. Bigger official hurdles inevitably lie ahead in the form of registration for public examinations, but one step at a time.</p> <p>The family member who seems to be finding the situation most difficult to deal with is Josh. Katie confided in him first, but he didn't believe her. Over time, his position has moved to one of outright denial and a refusal to discuss the matter apart from the intermittent observation that \"It's all fucked-up\". Cass's and my best efforts to get him to open up and talk about how he feels have largely been rebuffed, though he has shown some softening of his stance in recent weeks.</p> <p>Fear of what his schoolmates might say when they find out is clearly a significant issue, but we suspect this is only one worry Josh is prepared, or able, to admit to. As the second child, he's had a lifetime of living with someone who has already been there and done that two years earlier, and now at a critical time in his own transition from boy to man, via the choppy waters of adolescence, his elder sibling is now going to be \"competing\" in an area where he once had a clear, distinct and different identity.</p> <p>The stress on the family has been intense; Katie recognises this and feels guilty, despite our reassurances that she isn't and shouldn't. This isn't just one person making a fundamental transition; this is an entire family in transition. Meanwhile, our three-year-old daughter remains an unaware and unconcerned island of calm.</p> <p>The complications of work, travel and childcare arrangements meant that only Katie and myself could attend the first session at the Tavistock clinic. She has outwardly seemed to be coping very well and maintained this view until a quizzical eyebrow and some gentle, but insistent, probing by the therapist produced details about \"bad days\" where it was difficult to get out of bed and face the world with a body that seems alien. It's hard to imagine what this must feel like, but the discussion jolted me uncomfortably, and forced me to consider how utterly fundamentally Katie's sense of identity is now in opposition to her biology. Her account of dysphoria put me in mind of Kafka's Metamorphosis, where the protagonist, Gregor Samsa, wakes one morning to find that his body has been replaced by that of an insect. This is not just a teenager worrying about spots, or wishing she were taller, prettier or more blond.</p> <p>Cass will be coming with us to the next session but Josh is still immovable and refuses to discuss the issue. This makes the impact on him harder to assess. He is a real worry.</p> <p>Most parents might agree that not much can prepare you for raising a family, but for many of the situations, challenges, and outright puzzles that confront us there is advice to be found in parents and friends and a trusty copy of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781405348492\" title=\"\">Penelope Leach's Your Baby &amp; Child</a>. Katie's situation is relatively unusual and deeply profound so it feels as if we are finding our own way with little to go on. Yet Cass and I both know families experience much worse, and we are still very much a family \u2013 just not quite the same one we were six months ago.</p> <p><em>All names have been changed</em></p> <h2>Gender Identity Disorder<br></h2> <p>Gender Identity Disorder (GID) is the term given to people who feel they are in the wrong body. The first port of call is your GP, who will hopefully refer you to the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services team. You may then be referred to the Tavistock and Portman Clinic (you can also self-refer), the only place in the UK that deals with children with GID.</p> <p>At the Tavistock and Portman, a full background and history is taken and extensive counselling is offered. There will be an endocrinology test to check for a hormone imbalance. \"We don't take a view on whether GID will desist or persist. We try to ameliorate any negative effects and give them the space and opportunity to explore how they feel,\" says Dr Polly Carmichael, director of the Tavistock and Portman GID service.</p> <p>Children with GID can become extremely distressed around the time of puberty when their bodies change. As well as extensive counselling, they may be offered a monthly injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) commonly known as a blocker. This is entirely reversible, although the long-term effects are unknown.</p> <p>In effect, the blocker puts puberty on pause and removes the psychological and hormonal distress of the changing body to allow the child to think about what he or she wants to happen next. Previously, this blocker wasn't available before the age of 16, but now, in line with Dutch protocol, it's offered earlier.</p> <p>At about 16, this may be continued or stopped; or the young adult can then go on to cross-sex hormones.</p> <p>At 18, the patient would be transferred to adult services, with the option of surgery if required. The Family Law Act says that a young person is a minor in terms of medical treatment until the age of 16. However, in GID cases treatment can be given earlier, without parental consent if the minor is deemed by a doctor to be competent and that they understand the decision they are making and the consequences of it. However, in practice it's extremely rare that a surgeon would perform surgery before the person is 18.</p> <p>\"It's hard to grasp the distress associated with GID,\" says Dr Carmichael. \"And it's important to understand that the blocker is not the inevitable step to the next stage. By referring to us, someone is not on the inevitable road to change.\"</p> <p><strong>Annalisa Barbieri</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Support and information: </em><a href=\"http://www.pfc.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>pfc.org.uk</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.tavistockandportman.nhs.uk/childrenyoungpeoplegenderidentityissues\" title=\"\"><em>tavistockandportman.nhs.uk/ childrenyoungpeoplegenderidentity issues,</em></a><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.mermaidsuk.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>mermaidsuk.org.uk</em></a></p>",
  "<p><strong>I am dreadfully upset by the behaviour my in-laws display towards our baby. We live minutes from them but hundreds of miles from my parents. We have a nine-month-old baby girl, S, while my sister-in-law has a baby girl a few months older, A. </strong></p> <p><strong>Since A was born, my mother-in-law has become obsessed with her to the point that she has her more than her own mother does and tries to convince everyone that she is the most perfect baby. This wouldn't bother me if she didn't imply, by comparing them, that our baby is less perfect. </strong></p> <p><strong>She has no time for our baby as she is too busy obsessing about baby A. In her lounge she has 30 or more photographs of baby A (no exaggeration) while there are one or two of our baby. </strong></p> <p><strong>I find this deeply upsetting and offensive but my husband doesn't seem so bothered. On many occasions I have tried to allow her to spend some time with our baby but she has cancelled because something has come up that suits baby A and her parents better. </strong></p> <p><strong>While my husband acknowledges their lack of interest he says there is no solution because if he mentions it to them, any effort they consequently make will not be sincere. He also says he will fall out with them if he raises the issue. I don't want him to fall out with his parents but I find it increasingly difficult to bite my tongue in social situations when his mother makes provocative comments. </strong></p> <p><strong>I am eaten up with anger and upset, and do not know how to handle the situation \u2013 to avoid them completely would be difficult and to confront them about it&#xa0;would upset my husband. <em>Anon, via&#xa0;email</em></strong></p> <p>I wonder why your husband feels he'll \"fall out with them completely if he raises the issue\". Are his links with his parents so tenuous that such a conversation would result in estrangement? I sense a hotbed of emotions. I wish I knew more about your situation: what things were like with your in-laws before baby S came along; your husband's relationship with his parents, and indeed his sibling; your father-in-law's role in this. Is the mother of baby A your mother-in-law's daughter or her daughter-in-law?</p> <p>It's not unusual for a mother to be closer to her daughter's children than her daughter-in-law's children. This doesn't make it fair or right, but it can be because she doesn't want to interfere too much with the way her son's wife does things. It also sounds as if you miss your own family and perhaps hoped your husband's family would be good stand-ins.</p> <p>I also wonder if you're in a stronger position than you realise? Your mother-in-law sounds as if she's trying to impress you. Perhaps she is slightly in awe of your mothering skills, and feels she (or her daughter if it's her daughter's baby) has to \"keep up\". She may even feel judged by you and be using the lack of photos of your baby etc as a passive-aggressive gesture.</p> <p>There could be countless reasons and I think it's important to try to step back and get some perspective, from all sides.</p> <p>Eileen Murphy, a psychotherapist (<a href=\"http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ukcp.org.uk</a>), suggests that you might try to ask some \"gentle, non-challenging questions\" such as, \"I see that you don't have many photos of S. I&#xa0;am sorry, have I not given you the best ones?\"</p> <p>(I'm afraid I would also be tempted to be incredibly childish and get a huge blow-up photograph on canvas, or possibly velvet, of my baby, and present it to her.)</p> <p>Murphy wonders if there is another family member who could be involved in \"gently probing what is really going on? Or is it like the majority of families where such potentially painful and upsetting issues are ignored and smoothed over?\"</p> <p>I've said before that, sometimes, issues with husbands can be projected on to mother-in-laws. I'm not saying that this is what's happening in your case, but I do think your husband needs to support you a bit more and that you would be justified in being miffed about his inertia.</p> <p>Ultimately, you can't change your mother-in-law. But don't despair. To be kind for a moment, the role of a mother-in-law isn't always easy. You go from starring role as a mother one day, to mere understudy.</p> <h2>Your problems solved<br></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

  "<p>I can't believe that it's 20 years since I told you. It seems like yesterday. The two of us, sitting on a sofa in our local health spa after a swim and a sauna. You with an orange juice, me with a glass of wine. My choice of drink a desperate attempt to steady my nerves. This was the moment I had been dreading for the past few months.</p> <p>I had come home that weekend from London knowing that the time had come, that I could no longer keep lying to the person I loved most in the world. I felt as though I had a grenade in my hand, and it was only a matter of time before I had to pull the pin. We had always been close, you and I, as an only child our relationship was sometimes a battle of wills but deep down we always had a strong mother-daughter bond. My fear was that what I was about to tell you would shatter that bond into a million pieces and it would be impossible to mend. I was absolutely terrified.</p> <p>You knew me so well, knew that all was not right, and hadn't been right for quite a long time. I remember that as we were sitting there, chatting on that sofa, you held my hand. You had a mother's intuition that something was worrying me, I took the plunge and said that yes there was something. I remember trying to contain the panic inside, hide the fear from my eyes, and stop myself from running. This was it. I couldn't help but laugh when you asked me if I was involved in some kind of love triangle, maybe seeing a married man? That day will be etched on your mind as it is on mine.</p> <p>When I said it wasn't anything like that, I will never forget how you turned to me, looked me straight in the eyes, and asked if it was another woman. Did I ever tell you, Mum, how brave I thought you were to ask that question, knowing the answer might mean you had to face one of your worst fears? Yes, I said, it was another woman.</p> <p>And as simply as that, there it was, out there, the words hung in the air, suspended between us. I remember gripping your hand for dear life, desperate for you not to let go of me. In the end you had to ask me to loosen my grip because I was cutting off your circulation! I was so thankful that you didn't shout, cry or run. Instead, you just sat there holding my hand and we&#xa0;talked.</p> <p>After I came out to you that day, and the reality of the situation sank in, I knew that for a long time it was so very hard for you, Mum. It may have gone unsaid, but it didn't go unnoticed, that not only did you have to deal with your own emotional turmoil, but also with my father's too. Although I think it helped us all that I was living away in London, it must have been very lonely for you as you had no one to confide in in those early years. I knew you had to come to terms with something I had been dealing with and slowly accepting for 10 years.</p> <p>For me, coming out was ultimately a tremendous relief. I no longer had to&#xa0;lie about who I was, I no longer had&#xa0;to lead a double life. For you it was&#xa0;the start of a journey that tested your faith, your values and your friendships.</p> <p>Through all of that, not once did I feel your love for me waver in the slightest. In fact I think it was because of that love that you found the courage, little by little, to tell friends, close family \u2013 even the vicar! Being of the generation in which many were ignorant and bigoted when faced with gay issues, it can't have been easy for you to tell people, but you were determined not to hide me away.</p> <p>To that end, I know it was you who finally persuaded Dad to let me bring my first serious girlfriend home \u2013 you'll never know how much that meant.</p> <p>After that you welcomed other partners, you even gave one girlfriend advice when she was about to come out to her own parents! And now I'm in a civil partnership and you have a daughter-in-law and a grandson you love and adore. We've come a long way, you and I, in these past 20 years. I know you are proud of me; it is time for me to say how proud I am of you too.</p> <p>So thank you, Mum, for your acceptance, support and \u2013 most of all \u2013 unconditional love.</p> <p><em>Love, Sarah x </em></p>",
  "<p>Television law dictates that bad people either turn good or get their comeuppance. Real life doesn't always work that way. In real life, bad people keep the money you paid for a timeshare that doesn't exist. They overcharge your granny for retiling her roof. They enjoy watching the Pingu DVD they nicked from under your niece's Christmas tree (the one in which Pingu steals some sweets, gets grounded and learns his lesson).</p> <p>In that sense, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a> is like real life. Bad people do bad things and get away with it. Bad things like drug dealing, kidnapping and murder. Things for which Pingu would have been grounded until he was a very old penguin indeed. It begins with gifted chemistry teacher Walter White (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2009/nov/21/bryan-cranston-breaking-bad\" title=\"\">Bryan Cranston</a>) discovering he has lung cancer. He uses his scientific know-how to make the purest crystal meth on the streets, with the help of former pupil and small-time drug pusher Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), as a way of catering for his family's financial needs long after his imminent death. This previously strait-laced suburban father finds that drug manufacturing is everything that teaching in an Albuquerque comprehensive isn't. Dangerous. Exciting. Fewer awkward staff parties.</p> <p>Jesse, meanwhile, becomes the show's unlikely hero. He's a junkie, thief and pusher, mostly trying to do the right thing, though thanks to his Laurel &amp; Hardy relationship with \"Mr White\" he is continually dragged back into the mire.</p> <p>So how would Aaron Paul feel if, in 20 years time, a daughter he doesn't yet have brought Jesse home?</p> <p>\"I'd like him,\" he says, then hesitates. \"Y'know, that's not true. He's a murderer, a drug dealer, a drug manufacturer and a drug user. That's not a good combination to be going out with my daughter.\"</p> <p>But he's a good boyfriend, I argue.</p> <p>Paul laughs. \"He <em>is</em> a good boyfriend! Absolutely. He just needs to get his shit together before he starts hanging out with my daughter.\"</p> <h2>'If you use meth for two years, it ages you 20 years. It's crazy what it does to you.

You will root for his scoundrel, feel his pain when he's forced to blow a semi-innocent party's brains all over the wall. He's a classic Lost Boy with an outsider drawl that almost a carbon copy of Christian Slater's in True Romance. A moral compass struggling with his own moral compass.</p> <p>\"It's crazy [that people side with Jesse],\" he says. \"At the beginning, everyone \u2013 including me \u2013 saw him as just a drug burn-out. A kid with no sorta brains. But as each episode was revealed to everybody, it showed quite the opposite. It's incredible how Walt and Jesse are completely trading positions. Walt has no morals whatsoever any more, and Jesse, who wants to try to be good, is terrified of him.\"</p> <p>Last month, Paul walked off with his second Emmy for Best Supporting Actor In A Drama, crowning a year in which Breaking Bad took firm root in the British psyche. Broadcast on AMC in America, it hasn't found a stable home on our screens yet, beyond graveyard screenings for the first two seasons on FX and 5USA. The many contractual complexities of transatlantic show-swapping are beyond mere mortals, but you'd hope, given the level of interest, that situation might be rectified soon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a show built around the deadly supply and demand of an addicted clientele has become an addiction in itself. Unwilling to wait for a UK TV channel to buy the rights, fans have flocked to streaming sites such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/20/netflix-reaches-1000000-uk-subscribers\" title=\"\">Netflix</a>, which cruelly only gives you 15 seconds to switch off once an episode has finished before it boils up a teaspoon of the next one.</p> <p>The action is slow and sporadic. It might focus one week on Walt trying to hold his crumbling family together, or Jesse trying to kick his habit. It's content to lollop where other shows run. Then it explodes in gruesome violence and bravura set pieces, served up with the bombast and humour you just don't get from a Wire grumblethon.</p> <p>With series four out on DVD, and five (the first half of which just aired in the US) set to be the last, there is just one hit remaining. It will mean the end of a brilliant part for Paul. Seldom will a role be so rich that it facilitates him pretending to be high, pretending to kill someone and pretending to be heartbroken, all in one episode.</p> <p>So which is the most difficult? \"Oh God. Probably killing a man. I've never killed a man before,\" he says. \"But I've definitely been heartbroken. And \u2026 I can imagine what it's like being super high. I do so much research on YouTube. It's where the most honest stuff is.\"</p> <p>How do you go method for meth addicition?</p> <p>\"I talked to a lot of addicts, people that are now clean. Meth is such a dark monster. It takes control of you. I lost someone very close to me to meth. She's sober now, but we don't talk any more. I saw meth take complete control of her. It was so quick. When someone uses meth it ages you 10 years in a year. If you use it for two, it ages you 20 years. It's crazy what it does to you. It's a horrible, horrible drug.\"</p> <h2>'In the street, I get a lot of \"Yo, bitches!\".

It's funny: I don't have young girls running up to me screaming and crying, I have grown <em>men</em> running up to me screaming and crying. I love it, though. Breaking Bad turns our fans into fan-girls when they meet their favourite character.\"</p> <p>Presumably, he also has to deal with people assuming he and Jesse are one and the same.</p> <p>\"Yeah, it's funny. Actually, it's not funny,\" he admits. \"It's sad if people assume that, because I play a druggie on TV, I'm a druggie for real. I'm quite the opposite. Drugs, I'd like to reiterate, are bad. Don't do drugs and don't kill people! It's obvious, but worth remembering.\"</p> <p>This must be a strange position for an actor whose early ambition was to be in Fraggle Rock.</p> <p>\"Yes!\" he enthuses. \"Fraggle Rock was my first memory of a show I watched all the time. That, and Duck Tales. Remember how Scrooge McDuck used to dive into a pool of his coins? I wondered how he didn't hurt himself. That never made sense to me.\"</p> <p>He seemed to be having a good time, I suggest.</p> <p>\"He <em>was</em> having a good time.

  "<p>Renewable energy is the future, say environmentalists. But for green and ethical investors it has turned into a nightmare, with makers of wind and solar power systems among the worst-performing stocks in recent years.</p> <p>Take Vestas, the Danish wind turbine maker. Early investors enjoyed sparkling returns, with shares leaping from 34 Danish kroner in 2003 to 698 in 2008 \u2013 a 20-fold rise. But since then, beset by the loss of government subsidies, cost overruns, production delays and competition from China, the price has collapsed. Today it is trading at 35 kroner \u2013 so someone investing in 2008 will have lost nearly 95% of their money.</p> <p>In August Vestas revealed it had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/vestas-job-cuts-quarterly-loss\" title=\"\">slumped into losses and shed another 1,400 jobs</a>, bringing total redundancies for the year to more than 3,700. It had planned to construct a plant at Sheerness docks in Kent to supply turbines for expected deep-water North Sea windfarms, but this was axed in June.</p> <p>Solar panel manufacturers have also burnt a hole in investors' pockets. Look at SunTech, the world's biggest maker of PV (photovoltaic) panels, based in Wuxi, China. Its private equity backers (notably Goldman Sachs) made a fortune when it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, making well over 10 times their original investment. So did the people who bought at the initial share launch, with the shares shooting from $20 to $79 in late 2007. And today? They are changing hands at just 92 cents. First Solar, another one-time darling of Nasdaq, collapsed from $308 in April 2008 to $23 last week. Solar is an industry awash with overcapacity in China, falling prices and declining government subsidies.</p> <p>Funds that specialise in renewable energy have fallen a long way short of expectations. Impax Environmental, an investment trust, has lost 20% over the past five years, while BlackRock New Energy investment trust has done even worse, falling 49.9% since 2007. It's a salutary reminder to avoid investment fads and bubbles.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many \"sin\" stocks screened out by ethical investors have outperformed. At the turn of the century, in the midst of the \"TMT\" (technology, media and telecoms) stock market bubble, tobacco companies were the market's most unloved sector. Shares in British American Tobacco, makers of Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall, were changing hands at 224p. Today they fetch \u00a331.93.</p>",
  "<p>The amount of money invested in a \"sustainable and responsible\" manner in the UK has swelled to an estimated \u00a3275bn, a report has found. The study from Eurosif, the Brussels-based European Sustainable Investment Forum, claims that an exciting new phase in the development of ethical investment is now taking place in the UK. To mark National Ethical Investment Week, which starts on 14 October, Guardian Money looks at the latest themes on green finance and explains how you can join the ethical revolution.</p> <h2><strong>Rail:</strong> The right track for green investors</h2> <p>It says a lot about the changing nature of environmental investing that the latest theme in some portfolios is the glamour stock of the Victorian era \u2013 railway companies. Amid rising petrol prices and congested roads, many rail firms, particularly in the US, have enjoyed a renaissance, supported by environmental investors keen to see polluting trucks taken off the highways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648192\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041320018/Train-in-sunset-001.jpg\" alt=\"Train in sunset\" width=\"220\" height=\"139\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1970s and early 1980s many American railroad companies were on the verge of bankruptcy, having lost their passenger business to the car, and much of their freight as well. But they fought back with huge increases in fuel efficiency \u2013 America's railroads are three times more fuel efficient than sending freight by truck \u2013 and improved service reliability. Around 40% of freight in car-loving America is now carried by rail, a much higher figure than in Europe, while President Obama has agreed huge new federal investment in<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/16/barack-obama-high-speed-rail\" title=\"\"> high-speed passenger lines</a>.</p> <p>Shares in railroad companies have soared. <a href=\"http://www.up.com/\" title=\"\">Union Pacific</a>, which dates back to 1862 and dominates west of Chicago, was trading at $30-$35 in 2004 but shares now change hands at more than $120. In 2009, legendary investor Warren Buffett bought America's second biggest rail operator, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, in a deal valuing the company at $44bn, while CSX, the third biggest operator, has seen its share price quadruple since 2004.</p> <p>Truck companies that work with the railroads rather than compete with them, have also benefited. <a href=\"http://www.jbhunt.com/\" title=\"\">JB Hunt</a>, one of the biggest road hauliers in the US, partners with railroad firms to cut carbon emissions. As an example, it says, it can truck a shipment from a Procter &amp; Gamble plant in Delaware on the east coast to a rail freight terminal in Pennsylvania, then transport it by train to Chicago, where it is switched to another train to California, and for the last 100 miles by road truck \u2013 again to a Walmart store. So a 3,000 mile shipment travels just 150 miles by road.</p> <p>It tells customers: \"We can help you convert more of your over-the-road shipments to rail, saving you money and reducing greenhouse emissions by 50%.\" It's a win-win for customers, investors and the environment. JB Hunt's share price has jumped from $6 at the start of 2003 to $55 this week.</p> <p>Train companies form a key part of <a href=\"http://www.jupiteronline.com/\" title=\"\">Jupiter Ecology's</a> \u00a3340m portfolio, managed by Charlie Thomas. \"When investing in environmental solutions companies, rail businesses tick many important boxes,\" he says. \"They score well in terms of pollution abatement and efficient use of natural resources, while also responding favourably to the demographic challenges caused by a rising population (eg improving local air quality and reducing congestion).\"</p> <p>He has invested in Kansas City Southern, as well as Hub Group, which, like JB Hunt, is an \"intermodal\" company maximising efficiency between road and rail. But it's not just a US story. Jupiter Ecology counts East Japan Railway among his top 10 holdings.</p> <h2><strong>Water:</strong> the big new wave</h2> <p>Ten litres of water is used to produce just one single sheet of A4 paper. Around 850 litres of water is needed to irrigate, grow and process the oranges squeezed to produce one litre of juice. And if you buy steak mince this weekend, consider this: it will have taken 7,750 litres of water to produce a half-kilo pack that's enough to make a few burgers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041395163/An-orange-tree-001.jpg\" alt=\"An orange tree\" width=\"220\" height=\"144\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orange tree Photograph: Etsa/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Etsa/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's little wonder that environmentalists are deeply concerned about \"water stress\". Asia's industrial revolution is driving a vast increase in water demand \u2013 and the supply is running out. The United Nations reckons that if things stay as they are, by 2030 demand will exceed supply by 40%, leaving up to four billion people suffering acute shortages.</p> <p>Only 2.5% of the world's water is fresh, and two-thirds of it is in fast-melting polar ice and snow cover. China is particularly at risk as industrial expansion continues at a breakneck pace. The country has 21% of the world's population but only 7% of its available water. When countries industrialise, they use far more water. In the developed world, industry uses 42% of the water supply; in the developing world, 81% is used by agriculture. But as countries build power stations, steel plants and paper mills, their water consumption rockets.</p> <p>So how are ethical investors responding? Sue Round is head of investment at Ecclesiastical Insurance, which runs the <a href=\"http://www.ecclesiastical.com/foryou/investments/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Amity</a> range of green and ethical funds. Her starting point is encouraging water-intensive companies to disclose how much water they and their suppliers are using, through what's called the<a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/water\" title=\"\"> Carbon Disclosure Water Project</a>. The project aims to put \"water stewardship\" at the heart of every company's business strategy.</p> <p>But is it having real impact? Round insists big companies are taking it seriously, citing Tesco as an example. It has worked with suppliers and factories to cut water usage by 300m litres a year. But while that's undoubtedly good for the environment, how does it help investors? Round points to Marks &amp; Spencer. \"It has made considerable water savings in recent years. All their environmental efficiencies have added significantly to their bottom line.\"</p> <p>The Amity International fund also invests in companies that are engineering solutions to the coming water crisis, such as recycling industrial and residential waste water. It holds shares in <a href=\"http://www.boustead.sg/\" title=\"\">Boustead</a>, a Singapore firm specialising in waste water engineering and whose products are in 800 water plants across the globe. \"Its treatment systems can safely return waste water to drinking water quality,\" says Round. Its share price is currently nearly $1, double the level of three years ago but still below the peak before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Ecclesiastical is also investing in desalination as a potential solution to water stress. It is estimated there are currently 543 ongoing desalination projects across 90 countries, each costing between $100m-$300m. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the biggest investors, but there are major projects in the US and China. Even Thames Water has spent \u00a3250m on a desalination plant in Beckton, east London, which can supply drinking water for one million Londoners, and Southern Water is considering one on the south coast.</p> <p>\"Advances in technology have turned a proven but essentially uneconomic activity (boiling seawater to produce distilled vapour) into one increasingly attractive as a solution to water scarcity via membrane osmosis,\" concluded Ecclesiastical in a research note earlier this year. It believes desalination will be a significant investment play for ethical investors, naming GE, Suez and Siemens as potential stock beneficiaries.</p> <p>And most green funds now have a portion of their portfolio dedicated to water stocks, while others, such as <a href=\"http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library/fundview/CHP4/Pictet%20Water\" title=\"\">Pictet Water</a>, invest only in water.</p> <h2><strong>Agriculture:</strong> solutions, not speculation</h2> <p>Big agriculture and the ethical and green investment community rarely see eye to eye. Two years ago a Swiss investment research firm named agricultural firm Monsanto as the world's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/the-least-ethical-compani_n_440073.html\" title=\"\">least ethical company</a>. Many ethical investors also despise the billions pouring into food exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where speculators are cashing in on constricted supply and rising food prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041262831/Close-up-of-Sweet-Corn-US-001.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of Sweet Corn USA\" width=\"220\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweetcorn USA Photograph:  /Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one British agricultural firm is catching the attention of green investors worldwide. Genus, based in Basingstoke, is the former breeding division of the Milk Marketing Board and is regarded as the world leader in improving pig and cow herds. \"Basically it is seen as a&#xa0;green and ethical stock because it has developed techniques to reduce the amount of feed and water required to get meat on to people's tables,\" says Mark Hoskin of ethical financial advisers Holden &amp; Partners. Shares in Genus, now one of the 250 biggest stock market-quoted companies in Britain, have tripled since 2009 from 475p to 1474p this week. It is currently a top holding in Ecclesiastical's Amity fund.</p> <p>Other green and ethical fund managers focus on food quality. Triodos, the ethical bank, which is shortly to launch a sustainable equity fund, says food companies will make up around 12% of the portfolio. <a href=\"http://cheviot.co.uk/investment-funds/climate/factsheet\" title=\"\">Cheviot Climate Assets</a>, a&#xa0;relatively new environmental fund, has 13.4% of its fund in food, specialising in grain production and harvesting, food testing and food processing.</p> <p>The staple food stock, so to speak, of most green funds is <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/\" title=\"\">Whole Foods Market</a>, the US&#xa0;organic supermarket chain with an outpost in London's Kensington. It has earned a Waitrose-style reputation in the US, where its combination of high quality and high prices have prompted wags to label it \"Whole Pay Check\". But its share price has hit $100 in recent trading, compared with just $10 in early 2009, and significantly above its 2006 peak of $77. Jupiter Ecology's largest holding is <a href=\"https://www.unfi.com/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">United Natural Foods</a>, the biggest independent distributor of organic foods in North America. Despite the financial crisis, the squeeze on household budgets and rising unemployment, United Natural Foods' share price has increased from $25 to $60 over five years. When the credit crunch first struck, analysts reckoned that households would cut back on costly organic produce but it seems the opposite is true, in North America at least.</p> <p>\"The sector has grown by 10%-15% a&#xa0;year for the last 10 years but even after that it still only accounts for 4% of all grocery sales in America,\" says Charlie Thomas of Jupiter Ecology. \"However, the number of people putting an organic product in their supermarket basket has gone from 20% to 80% of households.\"</p> <p>Organic food suppliers and retailers may meet western levels for sustainable agriculture but John Ditchfield of ethical advisers <a href=\"http://www.barchestergreen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Barchester Green</a> acknowledges they do little to alleviate hunger in poorer countries. However, he points to <a href=\"http://www.whebam.com/\" title=\"\">WHEB Asset Management</a>, a specialist fund manager focusing on challenges to the world economy, such as rising food prices and scarce water supply. It sees technology as part of the solution and is an investor in Trimble Navigation Systems, a GPS firm that tracks climate patterns to help farmers produce food more efficiently.</p> <h2><strong>Co-operatives:</strong> think small, think local</h2> <p>Many green investors are more than happy for their money to go into companies based overseas \u2013 US railroad operators, Asian water treatment firms and so on. But what if you want to invest in projects on your doorstep?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648195\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041196463/Butchers-Arms.-001.jpg\" alt=\"Butcher's Arms.\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Butcher's Arms.

But this looks like an underestimate.</p> <p>Only last week, communities minister Don Foster launched a \"<a href=\"http://www.communityshares.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Shares Unit</a>\" to help local people become part-owners of much-loved assets and services such as their community pub or football club. Backed by the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/\" title=\"\">Department for Communities and Local Government</a>, and run by <a href=\"http://uk.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operatives UK</a> and <a href=\"http://locality.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Locality</a>, the unit aims to help more local enterprises use share offers to get projects up and running.</p> <p>There is clearly an appetite for such schemes: earlier this year, a share offer for a community solar power station called <a href=\"http://www.westmillsolar.coop/\" title=\"\">Westmill</a> on the Oxfordshire/Wiltshire border raised more than \u00a34m in just six weeks.</p> <p>With these schemes there is usually a minimum investment, which is sometimes as low as \u00a310-\u00a350 but, more typically, \u00a3200-\u00a3250. The projected investment returns can vary, though 4%-6% a year is not uncommon.</p> <p>There does not appear to be a \"one-stop-shop\" website that rounds up all the community projects across the country that are looking for investors. However, both the Community Shares Unit and the <a href=\"http://communitysharesfund.coop/\" title=\"\">Community Shares Fund</a> feature details of current and past share offers.</p> <p>Guardian Money will continue to highlight some of the more interesting schemes that come to our attention. For example, ethical investors in Great Britain are being encouraged to look across the Irish Sea and invest in Northern Ireland's first community-owned wind energy co-operative.</p> <p><a href=\"http://drumlin.coop/home.asp\" title=\"\">Drumlin Wind Energy Co-operative</a> has plans to operate five 250kW turbines north of Belfast, and has already raised \u00a31.6m, which will fund the first two. Individuals, businesses and organisations can invest between \u00a3250 and \u00a320,000; it believes it can offer an average annual return of 7% to 10% over 20 years. The share offer is open until 30 November.</p> <p>Another site worth checking is <a href=\"https://www.abundancegeneration.com/\" title=\"\">Abundance</a>, which describes itself as a \"community finance platform\" allowing people to put money into UK renewable energy schemes and receive a regular cash return based on the energy produced. It currently has two projects open: a wind turbine in the Forest of Dean, and a scheme to install solar panels on homes in the South Downs.</p>",
  "<p>There are more than 1.5 million freelance contractors and consultants in the UK. Most are genuine and pay tax in full. Indeed, many would rather be on the payroll and taxed through PAYE, but aren't given the choice by employers, some of whom are abusing the tax system. But other freelances are, to put it bluntly, on the fiddle.</p> <p>A committee of MPs, led by Margaret Hodge, have expressed their shock and disgust at how many of the BBC's high-earning stars are paid through \"personal service companies\". By channelling their earnings through a personal service company an individual is paid gross and can cut their tax to around 20%, especially by avoiding national insurance.</p> <p>The revelations led to an orgy of BBC-bashing \u2013 the corporation admitted to 25,000 off-payroll contracts, allegedly including some of its biggest stars, but the issue runs far wider. Across Britain, employees paying full tax through PAYE can for years be sitting next to individuals classified as contractors and freelances, who pay far less. Typical is this online comment from a reader of the Telegraph's coverage on the story: \"I work with a contract worker going to the same office as me for over 20 years. He can claim his rail fares to from work and other perks. It's not fair [to those of us] on PAYE.\"</p> <p>The official term used by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) is a \"disguised employee\", which describes individuals who are directly employed by a company, but cheat the tax system by claiming they are a freelance or contract worker. But many would argue that the \"cheat\" is as likely to be the employer as the individual. Employers use outsourcing and casualising of their workforce to save on national insurance, pensions, holiday pay, and above all to skirt employment law. In general, employees have rights \u2013 especially regarding dismissal \u2013 that casuals and contractors don't. Indeed, some employers insist that individuals structure themselves into a personal service company so they don't have to pay national insurance and can fire them at will.</p> <p>HMRC has long tried to weed out disguised employees. The law already states that employees cannot resign and start work again in their previous job employed as a company. As long ago as 1999, then chancellor Gordon Brown ordered a clampdown on disguised employees through what became known as \"IR35\". It set out a number of tests designed to catch companies and individuals avoiding tax.</p> <p>So how can you spot a disguised employee? It's not only about the length of engagement; a contractor can, legally, remain with one company for years. HMRC looks at a <a href=\"http://hmrc.gov.uk/ir35/guidance.pdf\" title=\"\">number of tests. </a> Broadly speaking, if someone behaves like an employee and is treated like an employee, they probably are an employee, and can't be paid gross. HMRC couches it in terms such as \"control\" and \"substitution\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Control</strong> Does the employer have control over the individual, deciding when and where they work? Can the employer move the individual to a variety of tasks? Does the employer require the individual to work the same hours as other workers? Does the employer decide which part of a project the individual will carry out? Does the individual have to request when they can take time off? Is he or she expected to \"busy themselves\" when work on a particular project dries up? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, it's likely the individual is an employee, not a freelance or contractor.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Substitution</strong> If the individual can't substitute someone else to do their work, they may be regarded as an employee. This is where some high-profile figures in the media may find the rules challenging. They can set up a company that provides services, but if the TV or radio station won't accept anyone but them HMRC may argue they are, in fact, an employee.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Right of refusal</strong> This is crucial. In an employee/employer relationship, there is something called \"mutuality of obligation\". If a contractor can't prove they have the right to refuse work, it suggests they are an employee.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Business premises</strong> Does the individual own or rent business premises separate from their home and from where they are contracted to work?</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Efficiency</strong> Can the individual finish a contract early? Can they, for example, agree a \u00a310,000 fee for three months work and finish it in two? If so, they are a contractor. If they are expected to do something else for that other month, they are probably an employee.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Assistance</strong> Does the individual engage other workers who bring in at least 25% of turnover? Then the \"personal service company\" would, in the eyes of the HMRC, appear genuine.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Advertising</strong> Has the individual spent at least \u00a31,200 in the past 12 months on advertising? This is evidence they are a genuine small business seeking work.</p> <p>These tests are designed to catch people who behave like employees, but get paid by a limited company. In the last budget the tests were tightened further, with a package of measures to \"tackle avoidance through use of personal service companies\".</p> <p>Yet IR35 has, in reality, only had limited impact on the growth of personal service companies. It was expected to raise around \u00a3300m a year in lost national insurance and income tax from disguised employees, but a September 2011 freedom of information request revealed that figure was less than \u00a32m. The Professional Contractors Group, established in protest against IR35, has fought thousands of battles on behalf of freelances against HMRC \u2013 and won nearly all. It published figures in 2010 revealing that its legal advisers had won 1,485 cases for members, while HMRC won just eight.</p> <p>Meanwhile. HMRC has lost its appetite for IR35 challenges. In 2003 it carried out 1,000 \"enforcements\" of the legislation; that fell to just 23 last year.</p> <p>John Brazier, managing director of PCG, says: \"The solution is not to outlaw freelancing wholesale within the public sector. The jobs market is changing, not just here but across Europe. The government, rather than taking the retrograde step of attempting to push back against that change simply because it causes a few taxation difficulties, must develop a more sophisticated tax policy that changes with it.\"</p>",
  "<p>I was writing a thank-you card for a wedding gift when I heard the knock at my hotel room door. It&#xa0;was 8 November 2005. I was away from home, at a conference. When I opened the door, I expected to see my colleagues inviting me to breakfast. Instead, I saw a police uniform.</p> <p>\"Are you Shannon Moroney?\" he asked. \"I'm&#xa0;here about your husband. Are you Jason Staples's wife?\"</p> <p>His question flustered me. It was our one\u2011month wedding anniversary and I wasn't used to being called a \"wife\". But I nodded.</p> <p>\"I'm here about your husband, Jason. He was arrested last night, charged with sexual assault.\"</p> <p>I felt my body go numb. The officer continued.&#xa0;\"I understand your husband called&#xa0;the&#xa0;police himself.\"</p> <p>He handed me a slip of paper with the phone number of the police station and said I should call&#xa0;right away. Then, quietly, he said, \"I think you'd better expect that it was full rape.\"</p> <p>My stomach flipped. I felt like I was going to be&#xa0;sick. How was this possible? Less than two hours earlier, I had been lying in bed feeling so happy \u2013 I'd just had my 30th birthday, then our beautiful wedding and honeymoon. The night before, I had told Jason I thought I might be pregnant. \"That would be great,\" he said. \"We'll&#xa0;take a test when you get home.\" We had planned a celebratory dinner to mark our first month as husband and wife.</p> <p>My heart pounding, I called the number the officer had given me. \"I'm not able to tell you very much right now except that yesterday afternoon, at about 4.30, Jason assaulted two women at the store where he works. After some time, he took them to your home.\" I couldn't believe what I&#xa0;was hearing. It was as though he were talking about someone else \u2013 someone I didn't know. The sergeant continued, \"Shannon, you&#xa0;need to prepare yourself. This is very serious. Your husband is facing many charges.\"</p> <p>My mind was racing. \"Were the victims the two women who worked there?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"No, they were customers. We don't think he knew them.\"</p> <p>\"Are they all right?\"</p> <p>\"They are at the hospital being treated and they are expected to recover fully. I can't really tell you anything else until you get here.\"</p> <p>\"But how could he take them to our house? He rides his bike to work and\u2026\"</p> <p>\"He rented a van around six or seven o'clock\u2026 Jason drove back to the store to pick up the women and take them to your house. He called from a pay phone down the street to ask for help at 10.50 last night, and we were able to apprehend him there.\"</p> <p>\"Where is he now?\"</p> <p>\"Here, downstairs in a cell. You need to come directly to the station. You can't go home, Shannon. Your house is going to be searched. Will&#xa0;you be all right to drive?\"</p> <p>\"I'm going to call my parents and I'm sure they will come with me.\"</p> <p>\"We'll be here, waiting.\"</p> <p>I hung up the phone and stood for a moment. How could this be true? I'd just been told that the assaults had taken place around 4.30 in the afternoon, and Jason had called the police at 10.50 at night. But I had spoken to him just before that, around 10.20. That's when I'd told him I&#xa0;thought I might be pregnant. The two women must have been there in our house while we were&#xa0;speaking.</p> <p>As I waited for my parents to arrive, I got changed and noticed I was bleeding. A feeling of tremendous loss welled up inside.</p> <p>I met Jason volunteering at a local restaurant for low-income customers in February 2003. Jason was the assistant co-ordinator and head cook. He was tall, had an easy smile and everyone liked him. He seemed articulate and well-educated; I&#xa0;was into pottery at the time and he told me he loved to draw. During my second shift, he gave me a little card. Jason had drawn a caricature of himself in blue pen and next to it written his name, phone number, email address and the words, \"Available for pottery viewing, tea and chatting.\"</p> <p>I was excited and nervous before our first date. We had made small talk for less than five minutes before Jason said, \"There's something I need to tell you before we get to know each other more: I&#xa0;was in prison for 10 years. I'm on parole with a&#xa0;life sentence.\"</p> <p>Just a few months after his 18th birthday, in January 1988, he had been convicted of second\u2011degree murder. Still at school, in part\u2011time employment, Jason had been living with a roommate found by his mother \u2013 a friend of a friend. The roommate was a 38-year-old woman. She and Jason developed a sexual relationship, but he described their living situation as stressful. I had a hard time imagining a mother leaving her teenage son to live with an older, single woman he didn't know.</p> <p>On the day of the murder, Jason had been visiting his grandmother but needed to go home to take a shower before meeting up with friends later that night. When he got back home, his roommate turned down his sexual advances and they got into an argument. Wanting to end the conflict, Jason went into the bathroom to have a&#xa0;shower.</p> <p>His roommate followed, yelling, \"I'm going to tell your mother what's really going on here!\"</p> <p>Jason struggled for the right words to explain to me his overwhelming need to gain control over the situation. \"I only remember wanting her to stop screaming at me, struggling to the ground and striking her head against the bathroom floor until she stopped.\" He said that he wasn't aware of what he was doing until it was over.</p> <p>I realised that I was holding my breath. Jason looked down and shook his head. When he looked up, his face wore a baffled expression. It&#xa0;was as though he still couldn't believe it.</p> <p>\"I was found criminally responsible, which of course I completely agreed with,\" Jason added.</p> <p>\"Had you ever been violent before?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"No, never. I don't know how I was capable of it. I've never been able to explain it; I only know that I'll never do it again.\"</p> <p>I was surprised to find my heart going out to him. What I was hearing was horrible, but I&#xa0;worked as a school guidance counsellor and I&#xa0;pictured some of my 18-year-old students, with their varying levels of insecurity and vastly diverse home lives. I couldn't yet visualise Jason's upbringing, nor could I grasp the contrast between our lives in 1988. I would have been 12 when he'd&#xa0;committed this crime. I was living happily in&#xa0;the suburbs with my supportive, loving family.</p> <p>Jason was hoping to achieve full parole status in the near future, which would mean the freedom to live completely on his own. His grandmother had died five years into his sentence, and his mother lived on a disability pension and suffered from severe bipolar disorder. Jason made no complaints about his upbringing. \"She did the best she could,\" he said of his mother. His father had died when he was six.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397497402\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349868560021/Jason-painting-008.jpg\" alt=\"Jason painting\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The second time they met, Jason gave Shannon a card: 'Available for pottery viewing, tea and chatting'</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I got to know Jason, I was struck by how normal he seemed. There was no way that I&#xa0;would have known he'd been institutionalised for a decade, save for the fact that his music knowledge seemed to skip the 90s and he had a&#xa0;terrible sense of direction. I met his parole officer and psychologist, both of whom told me his crime was a one-off incident. He had been a&#xa0;model inmate and they weren't concerned he would ever offend again. Jason made me laugh, listen, think; I could tell him anything that was on my mind and he would understand. We got together for dinner, movies, hikes at a local conservation area. I loved being with him. Over time, I began to feel that I could move toward accepting Jason as he was now, including his past \u2013 but could I take on this burden? After several weeks of dating, I told Jason I wanted to take a&#xa0;break. He said he was in love with me, but he understood. It didn't take me long to realise that I&#xa0;was happier with Jason than I'd been in any other relationship. We bought a little house, pulled everything apart and rebuilt it. I got a&#xa0;job as a guidance counsellor at the local school and Jason enrolled in a&#xa0;drawing and painting programme, finishing with straight As. He began working on his portfolio and in the meantime got a&#xa0;part-time job at a health-food store to help pay the bills. We told my parents and closest friends about Jason's past, but they loved him anyway. They respected his honesty and sense of responsibility as I did, and they could see how happy we were with each other. Now my parents had to hear exactly what he had done.</p> <p>At the police station, a sergeant explained to us that a customer had entered the store where Jason worked. \"Jason took her at knifepoint to a&#xa0;back room where he bound her with duct tape and then sexually assaulted her,\" he said. I&#xa0;started to cry in horror and humiliation. So did my parents.</p> <p>Another customer came into the store then and Jason held her at knifepoint as well. She struggled until he overpowered her by choking her to unconsciousness. At some point she was also sexually assaulted. Then Jason rented the van, returned to the store and brought the women to our house. Waves of revulsion hit me. I imagined the victims, their pain and terror. My parents and I listened in stunned silence. One of us finally formed the question we were all thinking: \"How&#xa0;are the women?\"</p> <p>The sergeant took a breath. \"They are alive,\" he&#xa0;said.</p> <p>They were alive? Did that mean they had come close to death? I began sobbing inconsolably. The sergeant continued. \"The women were very brave. It could easily have become a double murder\u2026 My understanding is that they talked with Jason during the assault and tried to reason with him when they were at your house. He was talking about killing himself.\"</p> <p>Later that day, a female officer called Nora told me that Jason had confessed to surreptitiously filming people, including me, going to the bathroom in our home on several occasions over an unknown period of time. For reasons yet to be understood, Jason had put the videotapes in the van before calling the police, so now they were in evidence. Soon they would need me to come into the police station to watch the videos and identify the victims.</p> <p>Nora told me in more detail what had happened that day, and I told her that I'd spoken to Jason on the phone at 10.20. She seemed surprised to hear this. Later, she and several other officers would insist that it was my phone call that prompted him to get help for the women, but I was never sure about that. I believed it was only part of the reason. The women themselves played a huge role in rehumanising him. Maybe our house, too, played a part. There, Jason was surrounded by our life: photos, grocery lists, the walls we had painted together. There must have been some reason why he chose to go home instead of&#xa0;anywhere else.</p> <p>At one point during the interview, Nora paused and looked at my hand. \"Do you and Jason have matching wedding rings?\"</p> <p>I nodded, caught off guard by her observation. What did it matter?</p> <p>\"He wasn't wearing his ring yesterday, you&#xa0;know,\" she said. Her tone seemed smug, almost defiant.</p> <p>I didn't know how to respond. Was she thinking he'd taken off his wedding ring yesterday because he planned to go out and rape two women? Jason always took his ring off in the shower, and that is where I later found it. Was the officer insinuating that I was a fool, naively playing my new role as bride while my husband lurked, a pervert looking for his prey? Worse, did she think I had known something in advance \u2013 or had even been a part of Jason's deviant life?</p> <p>Nora's questioning didn't stop there. \"Do you know that the average cycle of a sex offender is seven years?\" I shook my head blankly while she continued. \"Jason has been out in the community for seven years.\"</p> <p>Should I have known this? No one had ever mentioned anything like this to me \u2013 not Jason's parole officers nor his psychologists. And why would they? Until last night, Jason had never been considered a sex offender. There was nothing in our personal lives together that suggested Jason could be anything other than a&#xa0;caring, kind and fully reformed human being. Still, I thought I could hear blame in Nora's voice, as though I, too, had done something wrong. How&#xa0;could Jason have done this to me? How could he have betrayed our vows and left me here&#xa0;to be scrutinised?</p> <p>The last thing Nora said was that at the end of Jason's statement, he had told the detective he never wanted to see his wife again. She said he had written me a note.</p> <p>\"What does the note say?\" I asked Nora, desperate for any clue about Jason's state of mind.</p> <p>\"I don't know \u2013 it's still at your house. It will be taken into evidence during the search and I can tell you then, if you want.\"</p> <p>The Jason who'd been presented to me was not a man I'd ever met. He wasn't even the 18-year-old I'd tried to envision so many times and whom I'd come to accept as the correctional system's \"best guy\", someone who would never again pose a threat of violence. He was now a&#xa0;rapist.</p> <p>While I was with Nora, my parents had made a number of phone calls, including one to some friends who invited us to stay. These were the same friends who had hosted our wedding, but gathered there with friends and family that night, it felt like a wake \u2013 as if Jason had been killed in a sudden accident. I recounted everything that the police had told me. When I finished, my dad responded in a broken voice, \"I just know something must have happened to Jason when he was a little boy\u2026 I love him like my own son.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397497403\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349868857402/Shannon-left-with-her-sib-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shannon (left) with her siblings, mum and dad\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon (left) with her siblings, mum and dad. 'I love him like my own son,' said her dad after Jason's arrest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the following weeks, my body developed a&#xa0;cycle to cope with the shock: 30 minutes of really hard crying, easing off into numbness for an hour or so during which I couldn't really move but my mind would start to gain momentum. Then I would begin talking to a family member or friend, trying to figure things out \u2013 until this search for answers reached an almost manic state.</p> <p>At night, my mind created a film strip of all the violence and it circled continuously. When I managed to fall asleep, those images became violent nightmares. I would often wake up screaming or gasping for air. Sometimes, upon first waking, I would be graced with one split second when I didn't remember, and then it would all hit me again, a crushing wave.</p> <p>I had a vast network of friends, family and colleagues, and most were trying to get in touch to see how I was. Where was Jason? What state was he in? What had happened? How were the victims? Suddenly, I was a crime reporter instead of a bride. Most people expressed feelings of shock and concern for everyone affected. But soon enough, others began to express anger and rejection, even judging me and my family. They seemed to think that our love for Jason meant we felt nothing for his victims. Yet when I pictured the Jason I knew in his cell, I imagined he must be suffering and I&#xa0;wanted to be with him.</p> <p>Less than a week after I'd found out, I visited Jason in prison for the first time. He came through the door on the other side of the room \u2013 face down, drawn and grim. He looked up, our eyes met and we both began crying uncontrollably. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" he kept saying.</p> <p>\"Jason,\" I said, \"the police told me you said that&#xa0;you never wanted to see me again \u2013 why did&#xa0;you say that?\"</p> <p>The expression on his face changed from sorrow to confusion, and after a moment he said softly, \"No, Shanny. I said, 'My wife never has to see me again.'\" I felt a pulse of relief. It was something to hold on to.</p> <p>Jason went on to confess that he had been gorging himself on pornography over the weekend while I was away, and had gone to see a&#xa0;very violent movie. He said he'd become addicted to pornography while he was in prison, but he'd been too ashamed to tell me. The voyeurism was new in the last few months. He explained that he had always known something was wrong with him, but had convinced himself he was in control of whatever it was, experiencing long periods of time when he was \"unplugged\" from his demons. Recently, the addictive behaviours had been building again, though he couldn't explain exactly why.</p> <p>\"Why didn't you tell me?\" I asked. I felt repulsed, but also helpless and betrayed.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry. I was so afraid. I wanted to keep you&#xa0;out of it; to protect you from it. I thought it would go away.\"</p> <p>Jason had given a full confession that matched the victims' statements. He would plead guilty. The days went by quickly as I completed task after task in the aftermath of his crimes. At night, when I could no longer make phone calls to lawyers or help agencies, I searched for information that would help me understand. I&#xa0;banished my maternity books to my nightstand. Instead, I read psychiatric journal articles about sexual deviance, men who murder and rape, and adult survivors of childhood abuse and neglect, still suspecting something had happened to Jason that might help explain his acts of violence. Later, he told me he had endured physical and sexual violence at the hands of his mother, her boyfriend and his late grandfather. And that, at 18, when he was at a detention centre, he had been gang\u2011raped.</p> <p>I once asked Jason if he thought his early life experiences were related to what he did to the women that day. He said he didn't know, but they were definitely not an excuse. I had no idea what would happen to my relationship with Jason over time, but as long as I felt right in myself about supporting him and being in touch, I would continue. I visited Jason almost every week for months. I always cried for several minutes in the&#xa0;parking lot before I was able to drive home.</p> <p>I continued to be plagued by nightmares, insomnia, anxiety and flashbacks. I worried incessantly about the victims, but was helpless to do anything for them. I was easily agitated and had no outlet for my anger when it surfaced. I&#xa0;had lost my job as a result of Jason's actions and I could no longer even afford my TV bill. I was desperately lonely. Seeing people in town would elicit either a warm embrace or a cold stare \u2013 many days, I couldn't take the chance.</p> <p>On 15 May 2008, Jason was declared a&#xa0;dangerous offender and sentenced to an \"indeterminate period in a penitentiary\". Everyone around me seemed to expect that I&#xa0;would feel relieved that the court process was over, but instead I felt drained and empty. On the one-year anniversary of Jason's sentencing, in&#xa0;May 2009, our divorce was finalised. I'd decided it would be best to lump two sad anniversaries together, rather than tarnish another day on the calendar.</p> <p>I began speaking out about my experiences and volunteering for <a href=\"http://www.peacebuildersinternational.com/\" title=\"\">Peacebuilders International</a>, making space for victims to tell their stories and have their needs addressed. At a party, on Valentine's Day 2010, I was introduced to a&#xa0;man called Mike and, on my 36th birthday, in September 2011, we learned we were expecting a&#xa0;baby. Two weeks later, we went for an ultrasound. \"There are two. I see two heartbeats!\" Mike exclaimed. The technician smiled and confirmed: we were expecting twins.</p> <p>Telling my story has made me feel that what I went through wasn't for nothing. I heard from the mothers, fathers, grandparents, sisters and brothers of people who had committed crimes and were serving time. They had lived with the same shame and loss that I knew; the same disappointment, confusion, sadness and stigma. I&#xa0;have opened myself up to renewed criticism and judgment at times, too. The harshest critiques came from those who could not get past the fact that I had married Jason knowing about his past. But we don't live in a black-and-white world; issues of crime and justice are never simple. I will&#xa0;never condone Jason's violent or harmful acts, nor can I plaster a simple term like \"monster\" on an individual. Knowing what I&#xa0;know, I don't have that luxury</p>",
  "<h2><strong>My overseas job has turned sour despite my strong work ethic</strong></h2> <p><strong>I work for a big international organisation, and six months ago moved from one overseas office to another. I have moved around the world quite a lot, so am aware it takes time and patience to shift between countries.</strong></p> <p><strong>When I arrived, I realised the manager was barely managing the staff, there was low capacity and one colleague was under-delivering. In order to get some support from this person, I had to take over the day-to-day management and coaching for him, and have been passed all the work that has remained undone in the previous months, as well as my own heavy workload.</strong></p> <p><strong>On top of this, my manager completed a performance review with me, in which my work was praised but comments were made about my character and style with which I&#xa0;disagreed. I asked her to review it and she referred to three instances where she felt I had been offensive to her, but didn't offer specifics. I&#xa0;believe she is feeling defensive and challenged on her management weaknesses.</strong></p> <p><strong>I think the situation is being manipulated to cast aspersions on my character, and despair that I am doomed to fail. I am also wary of going to HR who, from advice I have previously taken, are unlikely to do anything, or are more likely to support a manager in any dispute. I&#xa0;am very distressed that I am in a new job and a&#xa0;new country and in this situation, and it is beginning to affect my happiness and certainly my ability to deliver at work. I feel burnt out, stressed and depressed.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Your letter leads me to two general conclusions. First, that you are probably accurate in your analysis of your new manager's state of mind. And secondly, because you're seriously stressed and depressed, you're now magnifying the problems you face. Let me take the second point first.</p> <p>You are employed by an international organisation and have worked for them successfully in a number of different countries. Their central records will confirm that and will include positive references from previous managers. You must not allow yourself to believe that your reputation within the company depends crucially on this one manager's opinion, formed over the last six months. (And even this manager has already recommended you for a performance-recognition bonus.) So, please try to relax a little.</p> <p>Then, put yourself in your&#xa0;manager's place. She must be aware of her shortcomings; you spotted them immediately. She would also have noticed the way that you took it upon yourself to become the unofficial manager and mentor of your under-performing colleague. Admirable though this was, you must see that, to her, it would have seemed an implicit \u2013 and very public \u2013 affirmation of her own inadequacy. She knows you are good; but finds your manner uncomfortable. She may well be looking for reasons to justify her feelings but I very much doubt if she's out to get you.</p> <p>Managers are assessed like everyone else. Those responsible for assessing your manager will be aware both of her failings and her defensiveness. Please don't despair; and please don't get into a state of open challenge with her. I&#xa0;know it shouldn't be necessary for people to make allowances for their inadequate bosses \u2013 but it very often is.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Adopting an \"adult\" approach is likely to be most effective. Why not explain to her that you are very keen to understand how you can be most effective in this new setting, and explain how you have worked in the past and the sort of operating relationship you have built with previous managers. Let her know that you are positive and committed to the role.</p> <p>Explain that if she feels there has been some behaviour that she finds uncomfortable or even unacceptable then it is important that she tells you as quickly as possible if you are to build a positive relationship. It may also be worth suggesting a one-to-one meeting outside the normal performance management arrangement to review how you have settled in and discuss longer-term objectives and ideas. <strong>tetters</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Do your job well, help where you can, but don't try to be the one-person solution to every problem. No one will ever thank you for it. <strong>Imsava</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your performance review should have a place for you to comment on your performance. If it does, don't use it to get back at your manager \u2013 use it to set out your successes and how you've shaped them in line with the local culture. However tempting it is to help others, unless your manager has specifically asked you to, do it at your peril. <strong>kathjones</strong></p> <h2><strong>How do I find a career that suits the skills gained in my degree?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I'm going to graduate with a 2:2&#xa0;degree from a top-four university in chemistry with Spanish. I'm worried as I don't think any graduate jobs will be open to me apart from teaching. In addition to speaking Spanish fluently, I speak French. Help please! I don't even like any of the other professions (ie I want to stay away from finance, banking, marketing).</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I wonder why you haven't mentioned your chemistry degree? There must have been some reason \u2013 even some interest \u2013 that led you to take the subject in the first place. Why do you seem to have abandoned it?</p> <p>You seem to know pretty clearly what you don't want to do yet seem to have little idea what you would like to do. Concentrate on that. You're not limited by the nature of your degree. Your languages do more than qualify you to teach: in almost all sectors of business life (entertainment, import/export, travel and leisure, journalism, pharmaceuticals) there will be jobs for which your Spanish and French would be a valuable bonus to an employer. You must know what gets your brain and imagination working. Follow that instinct. Don't go for the fatter starting salary: go for what you'd almost be prepared to pay to be allowed to do. And only you can know what that is.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Check out the websites of the entry programmes for global companies that work in English and have R&amp;D, and see what's on offer. With your skills mix, that could possibly include a wide range of R&amp;D chemistry (not only industrial, but beautycare, food science etc) and perhaps also bio-tech, but also a lot of non-R&amp;D options (eg&#xa0;patent attorney). <strong>Oommph</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It sounds as though you're looking at individual careers and sectors and deciding whether they interest you. How about taking a slightly different approach and making a list of the skills you have and, of those, which you enjoy exercising and why. Then look for jobs that might allow you to use those talents. <strong>readie</strong></p> <p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>J<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/javierbardem\" title=\"\">avier Bardem</a> has a face that was made for Bond villainy: buggy eyes, crooked nose, full lips\u2026 And that's before you get to his hair. As the killer Anton Chigurh in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/118400/no.country.for.old.men\" title=\"\">No Country For Old Men</a>, he&#xa0;established a useful link between psychopathy and the side&#xa0;parting. Now, as Raoul Silva, 007's nemesis in the new movie, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jul/31/james-bond-skyfall-trailer-review\" title=\"\">Skyfall</a>, the actor looks as if an albino polecat is&#xa0;draped across his head.</p> <p>Bardem is back to normal brown hair today, a&#xa0;large presence in a London hotel room, with a&#xa0;slight look of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367/\" title=\"\">Depardieu</a> about him; <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jolie%20laide\" title=\"\">jolie laide</a>, if that term was ever used for a man. After these kinds of roles, I&#xa0;wonder if it's possible that the actor finds himself sinister. \"Every time I wake up,\" Bardem replies, and laughs loudly. \"I look at myself in the mirror to brush my teeth and it's very sinister. Ugh, look at that nose; look at those eyes. Ugh, my tone of voice.\" Of course, a movie star married to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/penelopecruz\" title=\"\">Pen\u00e9lope Cruz</a> can afford to talk this way without fear of being taken at his word. But still; Bardem's casual self-mockery makes him seem a very European kind of actor, away from the worst narcissism of his profession.</p> <p>Which he is. The 43-year-old and Cruz live in Madrid where, when he isn't acting, Bardem runs a bar with his sister. He calls flying to LA \"going to the office\" and tries to stay out of Hollywood as much as possible. The couple have a one-year-old child, and Bardem is resolute in not talking about it. He grew up in a family of actors, but not in a&#xa0;glamorous way \u2013 most of his family, including his mother, were poor, frequently out of work and struggled to make ends meet. As a result, Bardem is a pragmatist. \"You want to do your job well so that people in the future say, 'OK, he's not bad, let's hire him.'\"</p> <p>Being hired for the Bond movie was a big deal,&#xa0;even though he'd been offered parts in previous films in the franchise. This time, the confluence of a good script and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/sam-mendes\" title=\"\">Sam Mendes</a> as&#xa0;director persuaded him to say yes. The morning before we&#xa0;meet, a group of disgruntled journalists are&#xa0;dragged into Soho during rush hour for a&#xa0;three\u2011minute showreel and a lot of self\u2011important Bond fanfare. But the scenes are&#xa0;great \u2013 mostly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/judi-dench\" title=\"\">Judi Dench</a>, it has to be said, who when she hisses to Bond, \"Where the hell have you been?\" delivers a frisson of pure, exhilarating Englishness.</p> <p>Well, Bardem says, imagine what it's&#xa0;like to experience that in the flesh and then have to act opposite it. Appearing in scenes with Dench was, he says, like standing in&#xa0;front of a water cannon. \"When she opens her mouth and looks you in the eyes, you're like, 'Wow! This is a&#xa0;big deal.' You feel a force of nature&#xa0;against your chest.\"</p> <p>There was a point during filming when Bardem appeared in a scene with both Dench and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/danielcraig\" title=\"\">Daniel Craig</a>. \"And I looked at them both and forgot the lines. There was a silence and Sam said, 'Cut, what's wrong?' And I said, 'I'm sorry, man, I just realised I'm in a James Bond movie and M and James Bond are looking at me.'\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397694231\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349867165047/Javier-Bardem-in-Skyfall-008.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Bardem in Skyfall\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Skyfall: 'I forgot my lines. Sam said, \"What's wrong?\" And I said, \"I'm sorry, man, I just realised I'm in a James Bond movie\"'</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These kind of moments have more resonance, Bardem says, because of his relatively long apprenticeship \u2013 he hadn't made a big-budget Hollywood movie until <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135567/eat-pray-love\" title=\"\">Eat Pray Love</a> in 2010 \u2013 and the constant reminder from family and friends that not everyone is in his favoured position. Living in Spain is a fairly sobering experience these days. Bardem is not theatrically political in the Sean Penn style, but is solidly engaged in the fate of his country. He was born in 1969, \"when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco\" title=\"\">Franco</a> was still alive\". His mother belonged to a leftwing movement and had some problems with the regime, as did his uncle, he says, who spent time in jail for his political opposition. \"It was a very troubled time, to the point that to have the surname Bardem in those times was not good; you were pursued and put in jail. I was too little, but I saw things. People being arrested, my mother crying because colleagues of hers and people she loved were imprisoned or disappeared. The streets were violent.\"</p> <p>Now, he says, there are demonstrations every other day in Spain. \"Different issues, but all connected to the same problem, which is, 'We are not stupid.'\"</p> <p>What does he mean? \"The whole situation is crazy in that there is 50% unemployment in people under 30. There is a lot of emigration. I am very proud of my country for many things, but one of them is how politically involved the society is. The gap between politicians and societies is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and the more awareness there is, the more consciousness of who is responsible and how they should pay for it \u2013 what they should do to fix this situation \u2013 the less the politicians listen. There was a moment when there was a kind of interaction between politicians and society, now there is not. They're like a unique class of people, the politicians. Along with the bankers.\"</p> <p>It's hard to imagine him getting very far with that speech in LA, but Bardem seems to have relatively little interest in promoting himself as an A-list movie star. He was up against Russell Crowe in the best actor category at the Oscars 12 years ago, for his role in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/88199/before.night.falls\" title=\"\">Before Night Falls</a>, and won Best Supporting Actor in 2007 for No Country For Old Men, but most of his best work has been in Spanish, in films such as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104545/\" title=\"\">Jam\u00f3n Jam\u00f3n</a> and <a href=\"http://biutiful-themovie.com/\" title=\"\">Biutiful</a>. He was famous relatively young in Spain \u2013 he made Jam\u00f3n Jam\u00f3n in his early 20s \u2013 and has said that he quit rugby (he played for the Spanish underage national team) because <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/11/27/javier_bardem_the_dancer_upstairs_interview.shtml\" title=\"\">his high profile made him a target for extra kicking</a>, although now, he says, \"That's not why I retired from rugby. I retired from rugby because I was old and getting really slow.\"</p> <p>Anyway, that's Europe-famous. Hollywood-famous is something else entirely, and Bardem has come to that quite late. He's grateful to have avoided the worst aspects of the rat race, \"people too anxious about how the world is going to perceive them and to be on top of somebody else. And it's like, calm down, relax. These are not people who know who they are.\"</p> <p>This isn't confined to actors, of course. \"It's also a rule of the world. When you know people are really at peace with who they are and what they do, they collaborate and want to help you to improve. It's people who try to suck you in like a&#xa0;vampire that make you feel like, what's going on?\"</p> <p>This detachment is helped, he says, by speaking English as a second language; it forces him to put things more simply and to be \"more conscious of my limitations\". I wonder when he feels most Spanish \u2013 what the cultural triggers are, such as when Brits go abroad and can't cope with people queue-jumping.</p> <p>\"Oh, well, Spanish people are the ones jumping the queue. In Spain, they will kill you for that. In Britain they will say, 'Eh?'\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397694232\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349867397870/Javier-Bardem-and-Pen-lop-008.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Bardem and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz in Vicky Cristina Barcelona\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Photograph: Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He feels his nationality most keenly in America, because it gives him somewhere to retreat to if things go wrong. \"That's the background you have, to be able to think, it's OK, let's try, let's see. It gives you freedom and peace. If it's great, great, and if it's not, it's not. There is no middle ground in Hollywood; you're a failure or you're a success. That mentality is wild.\"</p> <p>It's pretty easy to be Zen about success from the vantage point of someone who has it, no? Would he be this cool if he was a failure? \"No, I&#xa0;wouldn't have been able to say that, I'm sure. The question is not that one, though. The question is, is it in your nature to sacrifice almost everything in order to make it?\"</p> <p>Is it in his nature?</p> <p>\"No. No.\"</p> <p>When stars talk of what they \"sacrificed\" to be&#xa0;successful, it makes Bardem cringe. What a&#xa0;superficial definition of sacrifice, he says, returning to his mother's struggle to raise three children alone, while having some kind of professional fulfilment, or his wider family of actors, finding ways to continue when no one would hire them.</p> <p>\"Sacrifice to me has a different meaning. The background \u2013 your own history \u2013 is way more important than what you can achieve as a&#xa0;professional. My mother is an actress; my grandfather and grandmother were actors. The parents of my grandparents were actors, in a&#xa0;time&#xa0;when actors were not allowed to be buried&#xa0;on sacred land. Terrible. My uncle is an actor, my brother is an actor and a writer, my sister used to be an actress. My cousins are actors.&#xa0;I've seen since I&#xa0;was born all that you can&#xa0;imagine in an actor's life. So I&#xa0;don't buy anything. I don't buy success. I don't buy failure. I&#xa0;only buy commitment.\"</p> <p>Even winning an Oscar didn't much move him on this score. \"Great honour, great privilege. I&#xa0;accept it, I&#xa0;get very emotional about it. Thank you. Next\u2026 Or they give you the worst review ever. I've had many of those where they go, 'Javier Bardem sucks.' You say, ugh, I'm sorry, I&#xa0;wish I&#xa0;could do it better. I'll try. Thank&#xa0;you. Next\u2026\"</p> <p>His mother took second jobs. \"She cleaned stairs. Worked in a bingo hall. Many other things.\" But as a child, Bardem watched how low&#xa0;she got when she couldn't find an acting job. \"As an actor, it has something to do with the skin. That is why we're so insecure. When we do what we do, we expose ourselves, and when they review us, in a&#xa0;way, what they're saying is we like you or we don't.\"</p> <p>At this point, I try awkwardly to twist the conversation around to Bardem's present family&#xa0;life and he reminds me that he never talks&#xa0;about it, other than to concede that having a&#xa0;child has reminded him how great his own mother was. Then he brings up the Madrid bars he owns with his sister and asks me to mention their names, for publicity.</p> <p>On one condition, I say; that you answer a&#xa0;question about Pen\u00e9lope.</p> <p>\"OK.\"</p> <p>Um. Oh. Er. While he was filming Bond, was she&#xa0;repelled by his hair? (Sorry; best I could do in&#xa0;a moment of brain freeze.)</p> <p>\"She was fine. She's an actress. She understands. You don't bring your character home. You learn to hang it on the door. Which sounds very logical, but it's not. When we did Biutiful \u2013 five months every day, six days a week, 14 hours a day \u2013 how in the world does the actor go home and be himself? That's why Daniel, after doing Bond for seven months \u2013 it's not that he thinks he's James Bond, he's cleverer than that \u2013 but of course there is something that gets confusing. If you go to a party and you go dressed as a banana and everyone else is dressed as something else, by the end of the night, you think you're a banana. Everyone treats you like one.\"</p> <p>(The two bars are called <a href=\"http://www.labardemcilla.com/\" title=\"\">La Bardemcilla </a>\u2013 one is in Chueca, the other in Santa Ana.)</p> <p>So. Bardem is at that stage, he says, when he is arriving at some plateau of self-knowledge, which is to say: \"When you're too young, you think you know everything. You don't know shit. Now I know enough to know that I don't know anything.\"</p> <p>He does such a good psychopath, you wonder what corner of his character he pulls it out from. It's a question of going back in your mind, he says, to when you've felt murderous rage, as everyone has, and just drawing it out. That's the fun part of his job \u2013 emotional tourism. \"Getting out of yourself for a little while, seeing the world through different eyes and\" \u2013 with the sanity that lets him stray so convincingly into insanity \u2013 \"coming back with less judgments.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Skyfall is released on 26 October.</p>",
  "<p>Things sure have changed quickly in the three years since my mother retired. Before she did, you see, she spent nearly 40 years working for the NHS, in family planning clinics serving some of the poorest areas of south-east London and making home visits to women who needed contraception but who couldn't come to her.</p> <p>Why couldn't they come to her? Sometimes they were ill. Sometimes physically and temporarily, more often mentally and chronically. Sometimes they were physically or mentally disabled. And sometimes their problems defied categorisation. Sometimes their lives were just too&#xa0;hard. Too chaotic. Beset by too many problems for even the best-intentioned, hardest-working teams of social workers, health visitors, doctors and psychiatrists to solve. Abusive husbands and partners who came, drank, hit, impregnated and left \u2013 sometimes to repeat the pattern with another of Mum's patients before returning to begin the cycle again. Drug addiction, as a&#xa0;result of and response to their own desperate childhood misery, which they could now see themselves reproducing, apparently unstoppably, in their own children. Sometimes a woman might have a disabled child whose difficulties kept her housebound. Sometimes simply not enough money \u2013 and no ability to borrow it from neighbours or family, who were unlikely to be any better off \u2013 for the bus fare or childcare needed to get there.</p> <p>There was, then, an almost infinite number of reasons a woman couldn't get to a clinic, even to secure something as vital as contraception. Though, of course, being able to conceptualise contraception as vital requires a degree of foresight, a degree of control over life and an ability to imagine a future unfolding differently, that such physical, social and economic deprivation as Mum's patients endured had an irritating habit of precluding.</p> <p>Even when patients did get to clinics, problems remained. They might not be able \u2013 for all the reasons described above \u2013 to remember to take the pill as prescribed. Language, religious or cultural barriers could all play a hindering part. Sometimes a woman came in secret, using a false name, not at the ideal time or at the right intervals but while her husband, partner, mother or in-laws were out, to be fitted with a coil or to smuggle more pills home \u2013 blister packets of freedom. And sometimes she would come with her husband or partner simply to confirm another pregnancy by a man who watched her too closely or of whom she was too afraid to risk denying him control of any aspect of her life.</p> <p>But now I have listened to the Tory conference speeches and George Osborne's plan to withdraw benefits from those who have too many children, and I realise things must have improved immeasurably over the past 36 months. Someone must have solved all the problems of all those women my mother knew, leaving behind only the genuinely reckless and feckless who breed only for the munificent sums bestowed by the state on every child (which again must have increased dramatically within the same time, so that every birth no longer pushes a family further into poverty, but adds another layer of luxury to an already gloriously sybaritic existence). I&#xa0;must tell her. She'll be delighted. They were all so, so unhappy.</p>",
  "<p>If you're taking more interest in the bees, birds and butterflies in your garden these days, you're not alone. The <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/Gardening/Help-advice/RHS-Advisory-Service\" title=\"\">RHS Advisory Service</a> has seen a&#xa0;69% increase in wildlife gardening inquiries in the past couple of years. It's a sign that gardeners \u2013 as stewards of more land than all of Britain's nature reserves put together \u2013 are using their plots to create refuges for wildlife.</p> <p>This year, the RHS and <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/\" title=\"\">Wildlife Trusts</a> joined forces to launch the <a href=\"http://www.bigwildlifegarden.org.uk/wildlife-garden-competition\" title=\"\">Big Wildlife Garden competition</a>: we can all learn from the winners about making our plots attractive to insects, birds and other beasts.</p> <p>Dennis Wilkinson is on a mission to improve his local area for wildlife. His efforts to bring wildlife to <a href=\"http://www.framfield-allotments.org.uk/pages/home.html\" title=\"\">Framfield allotments</a> in Ealing, and inspire fellow plot-holders and local schools won him first prize in the communities category.</p> <p>\"When I took on my allotment there was a corner of waste ground where people were throwing rubbish, so I asked the allotment manager if I could turn it into a&#xa0;wildlife area,\" Wilkinson says. He set about clearing the neglected area and digging a pond. He planted trees and shrubs, including hazel, cherry and walnut, sowed wildflowers, and donated bird boxes to his allotment neighbours to encourage them to create habitats on their own plots. It's a tremendous success story. \"We get loads of bats and slow worms now,\" he adds. His enthusiasm is rubbing off on others, too \u2013 log piles and ponds are cropping up on more and more allotments.</p> <p>Relaxation was on the mind of the winner of the small residential category, Thierry Suzanne, when planning his garden. \"I'm the lazy man of grass,\" he says. \"I&#xa0;didn't want to be mowing my lawn every week in summer, so I&#xa0;thought, 'I&#xa0;know, I could grow a&#xa0;meadow!'\"</p> <p>Meadows need to be cut only twice a year, giving Suzanne plenty of time to plan his next move. \"I wanted to use plants to blur the boundaries of my garden, and then I realised I could use this to help wildlife too.\" Before long, he had removed the fence at the back of his garden and replaced it with a&#xa0;mixed, native hedge of hawthorn, dogwood and wild pear: not only does this make the garden look bigger, it also offers cover and food for birds and insects. Now he's planning a green roof on his bike store and a pond. It's amazing what you can achieve when you're not preoccupied with a&#xa0;weekly mowing regime.</p> <p>Suzanne's garden is testament to how much you can do for wildlife in a small space. A&#xa0;long, narrow plot behind a row of terraced houses in east London, it's full of moths, frogs, birds and bees. He says the secret to a&#xa0;successful small wildlife plot is to grow plants that are beneficial to the gardener as well as wildlife.</p> <p>The winner of the large residential category, Terry Oliver, wanted to create a garden where he could observe wildlife and have a functional area for his grandchildren to use. The key to making a large garden appealing to both humans and animals alike, Oliver says, is balance. \"We have large billowing borders which are pretty much left to their own devices. We let foxgloves, <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/musk-mallow\" title=\"\">musk mallow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/purple-loosestrife\" title=\"\">purple loosestrife</a> self\u2011seed everywhere \u2013 if a plant wants to grow in a certain place, that's fine by me.\"</p> <p>To offset the wilderness, he keeps his lawns very short. \"Formal paths and lawns keep the garden in check, so it doesn't look as wild as it is.\" One of the best ways to help wildlife, says Oliver, is to avoid cutting back borders in autumn. \"If you leave them as they are until the end of winter, you'll provide plenty of cover for insects. Then you get to watch the birds come in for the insects in winter.\"</p> <h2>Where to start<br></h2> <p>Autumn is the perfect time to plan ahead for next year and find new ways of encouraging more wildlife to your garden or allotment. Here&#xa0;are some tips from the competition winners:</p> <p>\u2022 Dig a pond if you have the space, or create a container pond using an old bath or Belfast sink.<br>\u2022 Erect bird boxes and feeders (keep feeders stocked up over winter as birds will come to rely on the food you put out).<br>\u2022 Plant a succession of late-flowering plants such as <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/Gardens/Harlow-Carr/About-Harlow-Carr/Plant-of-the-month/September/Rudbeckia-laciniata-Herbstsonne\" title=\"\">rudbeckia</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedum\" title=\"\">sedums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/10559.shtml\" title=\"\">Michaelmas daisies</a> and&#xa0;<a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1993\" title=\"\"><em>Verbena bonariensis</em></a> to provide&#xa0;nectar and pollen for late-pollinating insects.<br>\u2022 Make leaf and log piles for overwintering insects.<br>\u2022 Grow climbers over your fences and walls to provide shelter.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, two American bloggers triggered a global media&#xa0;convulsion by embarking on what they called a <a href=\"http://www.the-beheld.com/2011/05/why-im-not-looking-in-mirror-for-month.html\" title=\"\">\"mirror fast\"</a>: covering the mirrors in their homes, and shunning mirrors elsewhere, in&#xa0;an effort to reduce what one of them called \"the overriding self-consciousness that's taken up residence in my psyche\". Since the social pressure to conform to ideals of&#xa0;beauty falls mainly on women, I&#xa0;can only guess what it's like to be so aware of one's appearance: I assume it's related to what I feel whenever a badly-angled photo reminds me how astoundingly bald I&#xa0;am. But for the fasters, the experiment proved a liberation. \"All&#xa0;the other interests in my life \u2013 my&#xa0;goals, passions, friends, family, favourite hobbies, etc \u2013 have attracted the energy and attention I used to give to my looks,\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/fashion/mirror-fasts-help-take-the-focus-off-yourself.html\" title=\"\">wrote Kjerstin Gruys</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/19/mirror-fasting-self-image-beauty\" title=\"\">Autumn Whitefield-Madrano said</a> she felt \"calmer and more serene\". They'd pulled off an ingenious psychological trick. In a world obsessed with appearances, it's impractical just to&#xa0;decide you're going to think differently. What they'd done, instead, was to deny themselves the feedback that fuelled the fixation.</p> <p>Which is striking, because almost every other approach to health and happiness assumes the opposite: that more feedback is always good. The way to get fit, we're told, is to track miles jogged and weights lifted; to get slim, you track calories; and the first law of time management is to keep a detailed log, to see what you're really doing with your day. Reflecting an increasingly popular approach, the website <a href=\"http://www.moodscope.com/login\" title=\"\">moodscope.com</a> uses mood-tracking to combat depression. There's an entire \"personal informatics\" movement, mentioned here previously, whose members use <a href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/\" title=\"\">smartphones and other devices</a> to turn their lives into data, so as to identify patterns and make improvements. (Join the fun at <a href=\"http://quantifiedself.com/\" title=\"\">quantifiedself.com</a>.) But mirror fasts are a reminder that more feedback isn't necessarily for the best.</p> <p>In a parallel exercise last month, Steven Corona, a tech entrepreneur from South Carolina, <a href=\"http://stevecorona.com/living-without-time\" title=\"\">\"unsubscribed from the clock\"</a>: \"I&#xa0;dropped my watch right into the garbage. Shut off the glowing green-blue digital clocks that seem to piggyback on every appliance known to man...\" He&#xa0;switched his iPhone to a random time zone (and did, he admits, continue to use its calendar to notify him of appointments). Much mockery followed: clock-fasting, critics rightly noted, wasn't an option for those who had to show up at an office by 9am daily. Still, as a compulsive watch-checker, I was inspired. After a few disorienting days, Corona says, his stress levels plummeted; he lost himself in projects, and learned to \"read the sun\". Insomniacs are advised to hide their clocks, because what doctors call <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932731\" title=\"\">\"nocturnal time-monitoring behaviour\"</a> is relaxation's greatest foe. Corona simply took that principle to its conclusion.</p> <p>You, of course, may have no hang-ups about mirrors or clocks. But it can be illuminating to ask if you've got other sources of feedback you might be better off without. Bathroom-scale readings? Bank-balance checking? All have their place. But all are also subject to the problem with personal feedback: once you've developed the habit of measuring something, it's hard to resist the conclusion that that thing matters. Maybe it doesn't. (And even if it does, maybe intuition would serve you better.) Sometimes, there may be data about ourselves we're better off not knowing.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Follow Oliver on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverburkeman\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Few things please me more than keeping fresh basil growing on the kitchen windowsill over winter. First, it saves shop-bought frozen pizza, and that is reason enough for every sill to carry one. A&#xa0;few torn leaves, a drizzle of oil and you can trick yourself into believing that you are not eating cardboard.</p> <p>It is also a good tonic for winter blues. Crush a leaf every now and&#xa0;then and the whole kitchen smells of summer.</p> <p>It is too late in the year to sow basil and get big fat plants. You can, however, sow for microgreens. Scatter seeds fairly thickly across a pot or takeaway tray with holes punched into the bottom, water well, cover with a shower cap or freezer bag and after five or so days you should have a carpet of tiny basil leaves.</p> <p>These will grow terribly slowly in winter light levels, so you only harvest the baby leaves with scissors when they are several centimetres high. These tiny leaves may only look like a garnish, but they are a&#xa0;flourish of basil flavour.</p> <p>If you hanker after large leaves, cheat. Go to the supermarket and find the least overstuffed basil pot (there's usually at least 10 plants per pot). Once you get home, split the plants into groups of two or three: that way there's still enough space for them to spread. I plant into 9cm pots using peat-free compost and place on a sunny sill. Using this method, one container can be split into three or four pots that quickly bulk out and you can pick till spring. To pick, pinch out the top set of leaves: this makes the basil branch out, meaning more leaves for you.</p> <p>Overwatering can be an issue in lower light levels. If the bottom leaves turn yellow, this is usually an indicator they are too wet. Water once a week at most so that the compost dries out between watering. Don't worry if the leaves drop a bit: basil is tolerant to dry conditions, but sulks if too wet.</p> <p>Damp conditions also encourage compost gnats, whose larvae like to&#xa0;gnaw on the roots. A layer of sand&#xa0;or grit on top of the pot helps to draw water away from the surface, making it less appealing for the adult gnats to lay eggs. For severe infestation try <a href=\"http://www.gardening-naturally.com/cgi-bin/sh000001.pl?REFPAGE=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gardening-naturally.com%2facatalog%2fGnat_Off.html%3futm_source%3dgoogle%26utm_medium%3dProduct_Search%26utm_campaign%3dgoogle_base&amp;WD=gnat&amp;PN=Gnat_Off.html%23aGO001#aGO001\" title=\"\">Fungus Gnat Off</a>, a biological control containing bacteria that kills the gnats at root level.</p> <p>If your basil starts to flower, pinch off the young buds, as once the flowers appear, the stems turn woody and leaf production stops. By spring they'll be desperate to flower, so let them: as there's more light, you can sow a fresh batch.</p>",
  "<p>In August 1988, shortly before the publication of a highly critical report into its operating procedures, the entire management board of Broadmoor secure psychiatric hospital was suspended by the Department of Health, which at the time had joint responsibility for its direct management.</p> <p>The running of Broadmoor, the highest-profile facility of its kind in the country and the home to many of Britain's most notorious criminals, was placed in the temporary control of a \"taskforce\", according to reports at the time, to be headed up by a somewhat unexpected figure.</p> <p>It was Jimmy Savile, the then 61-year-old TV presenter, charity fundraiser and national eccentric. \"There's nothing that can't be solved,\" he told an approving Sunday Times reporter at the time of his appointment, stabbing the air with his trademark cigar for emphasis.</p> <p>\"It is the simple 'fix it' attitude he brings to all areas of his life,\" noted the interviewer, adding that six months later, it would fall to Savile to appoint the first general manager to be responsible for the day-to-day running of the hospital.</p> <p>As the trickle of allegations against Savile, who died in October last year, has swollen in the past week to a torrent of ever more distressing accounts of rape and serious sexual assault against scores of girls and young women, one of the most disturbing and perplexing aspects has been the apparently untouchable position he held at a number institutions \u2013 places where we now know young women were particularly vulnerable to serious sexual abuse.</p> <p>Savile had been involved with Broadmoor for quite some time \u2013 West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which now runs the hospital, believes his involvement as a volunteer began in the late 1960s or early 70s. He had become part of the furniture, being given, no one seems to know quite when, an office in the grounds of the hospital, a bedroom, which he called his \"cell\", above it, and \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 his own personal set of keys to the hospital wards.</p> <p>But it now seems clear the apparently genial celebrity, while telling reporters he was the \"voluntary assistant entertainments officer\", had been using his position to abuse inmates with impunity.</p> <p>One young female patient, the Guardian reported this week, told a psychiatric nurse that she had been repeatedly raped by Savile under the stage in the hospital during the early 1980s, before he moved on to other patients. Another former resident said that when she was 17, Savile had groped her breasts while she watched TV in a ward.</p> <p>Broadmoor may be the institution where Savile was given the most senior position, but allegations of abuse have now been linked to at least five other establishments \u2013 the BBC, Stoke Mandeville hospital, Leeds general infirmary, the Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey and Duncroft approved girls' school in Staines, Surrey. At Duncroft, according to some reports, he would stay in the headmistress's quarters. At Stoke Mandeville, too, he had his own room, as well as an office .</p> <p>This week a disabled woman, Caroline Moore, said that in 1971, when she was 13, Savile had forcibly \"shoved his tongue down [her] throat\" while she was sitting in her wheelchair following an operation. Another woman, June Thornton, described witnessing a serious sexual assault on another patient she believed to be brain damaged.</p> <p>Some, it seems, did take claims of abuse seriously. John Lindsay, a detective inspector at Thames Valley police during the late 1970s, told the BBC that he was told by a nurse at Stoke Mandeville that Savile was abusing patients, and reported it to his superiors more than once.</p> <p>\"I was not believed, no, no. I think purely because at that stage and for many, many years Savile was an icon,\" he said.</p> <p>A senior colleague told him: \"Jimmy Savile is a high-profile man. He must be OK. He could not be doing anything irregular. Don't worry about it.\" Lindsay said: \"I wasn't satisfied but there was nothing I could do about it.\"</p> <p>In 1988, Penny Jenkins was a 22-year-old trainee occupational therapist at Stoke Mandeville, when for a period of a few months she found herself occupying a bedroom a few doors down from Savile, on a corridor of about 10 rooms above the occupational health department. The other rooms were occupied by other trainees, the overwhelming majority of whom were young women.</p> <p>Savile had been given the room at the end of the corridor, next to the shared shower and toilet facilities, she said, while his secretary would bring him breakfast every morning from the main building where his office was.</p> <p>Jenkins does not consider herself a victim of Savile, but this week reported to the NSPCC children's charity an incident which at the time, she says, she found \"disconcerting\", but which she now fears might have been part of a pattern of behaviour.</p> <p>She had taken a bath and was walking towards her room wearing only a towel when all the lights in the block suddenly went out. \"I heard someone coming up the stairs, and suddenly Jimmy Savile was very, very near,\" she told the Guardian. \"Before I realised it, he was right there in front of me.\"</p> <p>She asked what was wrong with the lights and he replied: \"Jim'll fix it.\" He grabbed her arm, she said, and started kissing it, before she was able to shrug him off and make her way back to her room. She reported it this week, she says, because she has always wondered if Savile tripped the switch to turn off the lights.</p> <p>Despite the incident, Jenkins insists neither she nor her fellow trainees had any suspicion that Savile's behaviour could be even more sinister \u2013 \"we just thought he was a leerer\" \u2013 and is convinced no one in the hospital management would have knowingly overlooked abuse by Savile. \"I just don't think that anybody was aware that that was going on. I just think they thought he was a funny old man, a pervy old man.\"</p> <p>Like all the other institutions concerned, Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which administers Stoke Mandeville, and West London Mental Health Trust have expressed shock at the swelling tide of allegations against Savile, and promised to co-operate fully with the police investigation.</p>",
  "<p>Lady Cholmondeley certainly got more than she bargained for when she asked for \"a few of your ideas of socialism\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/bernardshaw\" title=\"\">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s sister-in-law expected a brief summary, a simple user's manual on his political and ethical beliefs. Instead, in 1928 she was presented with a great tome that encompasses the meaning of life and just about everything from marriage and bringing up children to how to run&#xa0;industry.</p> <p>What she got was <em>The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism, Capitalism, Sovietism and Fascism</em>, one of the great, passionate and indignant expositions of how social injustice destroys human lives. Class and inequality create a rich and a poor \u2013 equal only in the obnoxiousness of both their stations \u2013 causing both the degradation of poverty and the idleness of wealth. Shaw has no truck with sentimentalists who romanticise the poor: \"The blunt truth is that ill-used people are worse than well-used people.\" \"I hate the poor and look forward eagerly to their extermination. I pity the rich a little, but am equally bent on their extermination.\" All classes are \"each more odious than the other: they have no right to live\". Nor has he any truck with Rousseauian romantic views of nature. It is the tyrant to be vanquished by civilisation: \"We are not born free.\"</p> <p>He begins as he ends: the only way to live is in a society where everyone earns and owns exactly the same, regardless of skill, effort, age, gender, character, intelligence, inheritance, merit or power. Women would at last be free of dependence on men: even now the gap between women's and men's earnings and wealth leaves most mothers with a choice between relying on a man or bringing up children considerably poorer without one. Absolute parity of income would mean merit and moral worth would be rewarded with esteem and not with cash. He has high hopes of humanity's capability for moral improvement: \"In a socialist state, economic selfishness would probably stand on a moral level now occupied by card-sharping.\" The rosy prospect of his socialist future stands in stark contrast to his miserabilist view of present humans: \"We have to confess it: capitalist mankind in the lump is detestable.\"</p> <p>It is capitalism that debases character and all human relationships, reducing everything to monetary value while misunderstanding the extent to which humans are not motivated purely by greed or acquisitiveness. This suddenly looks fresh in our post-2008 crash world, when conventional economics have come under attack for making exactly that error. What the economists got wrong in all their models and forecasts was their reliance on the odd notion that people are entirely driven by money. Look around you and it's immediately obvious how many other forces and other choices people make. Humans are not perfect calculating machines making rational getting-and-spending decisions to extract maximum monetary gain out of all their transactions. Shaw's call for the nationalisation of the banks and his highlighting of the need for local municipal banks has a pleasingly contemporary ring, too.</p> <p>However, few would turn to Shaw's <em>Guide</em> for a lesson in practical economics. Nor, alas, would this book make for a course in winning modern-day elections \u2013 though how our political discourse would be brightened up with platform speeches of Shavian quality. What you get here is as fine a debunking of all the myriad excuses for inequality as you will ever find. Give each what they deserve? That is what the well-off think they get, but once you try to devise a total audit of each person's merits or faults, the idea is rendered absurd. Let everyone have what they can grab? That is partly what happens, but traders need law and justice to operate, and themselves need the collective state to mitigate brute force. How much is enough, he asks. His wise reply is that there is never enough: \"Nobody can ever have enough of everything. But it is possible to give everyone the same.\"</p> <p>\"Why do we put up with it?\" That question has perpetually perplexed the left. Why is rebellion by the poor so rare? In this recession era of austerity and shrinking household incomes, Shaw's answer is much the same as observers might give now. People earning so much less than others are kept going in the illusory hope of \"pageantry\", winning the lottery or inheriting a fortune from a mystery relative. Charity, the dole \u2013 or nowadays the ever-diminishing top-ups to low pay from the welfare state \u2013 are kept just high enough to prevent destitution and revolution. The problem, Shaw says, is that the poor are kept ignorant, and without \"trained minds capable of public affairs\", so they cannot see how \"the evils of the system are great national evils\". Or if a few are plucked out and sent to university, they are \"de-classed\" and captured by capitalist thinking. Most people \"tolerate the evils of inequality of income literally through want of thought\". That, I suppose, is what the communists used to call \"<a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/f/a.htm\" title=\"\">false consciousness</a>\" as an explanation for the disappointing docility of the masses.</p> <p>What makes Shaw so likeable and readable is the odd blend of soaring idealism and no-nonsense realism. He is a <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fabian</a>, a believer in the parliamentary route to socialism, yet has no illusions about the unsatisfactory deficits in democracy. \"The millennial hopes based on every extension of the franchise from the reform bill of 1832 to votes for women have been disappointed.\" He is disgusted at how women voters failed to vote for women candidates or for those on the left who had fought to give them the vote in the first place. Indeed, women's votes, leaning more to the right than men's until 1997, helped keep Conservatives in power through most of the last century. As for the candidates themselves, despairing of their quality, he suggests, half-seriously, that their qualifications for office be vetted before they stand.</p> <p>By the time he revised the book for the 1937 edition, he was writing with fascism rampant in Italy and Spain. Though he was ambivalent and contorted on Russia, undemocratic communism looked unappealing to his Fabian mind. Without doubt a vote is better than no vote, for all its maddening deficiencies. \"I advise you stick to your vote as hard as you can,\" he tells his lady reader. \"Meanwhile, heaven help us! We must do the best we can\" \u2013 which was, more or less, also Winston Churchill's conclusion on parliamentary democracy.</p> <p>A great glory of this book is its grand peroration. With the lyrical eye of the playwright he casts all relationships \u2013 whether with lawyers, doctors, tradesmen, relatives, children or colleagues \u2013 as fatally tainted by everyone's need to get money from one another. Only liberate money motives from the world by giving everyone the same, and imagine how people's \"natural virtues\" would be set free from \"trade union and governing class corruption and tyranny\". Human nature would be \"good enough for all your reasonable purposes\".</p> <p>Misanthropic visions in books such as <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> or <em>Candide</em>, \"which under capitalism are unanswerable indictments of mankind as the wickedest of all known species\", would be looked back on as \"clinical lectures on extinct moral diseases which were formerly produced by inequality, as smallpox and typhus were produced by dirt\".</p> <p>Shaw writes in a fine tradition of utopian optimism. His image of a world under socialism renders humans as unrecognisable (and maybe undesirable) as in those religious visions of harp-plucking human souls cleansed of&#xa0;sin and transported to heaven. All that holds us back from bliss is \"pecuniary temptation\".</p> <p>But people will believe what they want to believe. \"The moment we want to believe something, we suddenly see all the arguments for it and become blind to the arguments against it.\" How true that rings in our depressed era bleached of political idealism, imbued with a \"nothing works\" despondency. Shaw's clarity of argument and caustic wit prod and question the weary old reasons why markets are immutable, the world must always be as it is and nothing can ever change. Here are all the reasons why the way we live now, as then, is insupportable, inexcusable, immoral and unhappy for too many. All&#xa0;it would take, he says, is enough people who want to change it. All writers can do is keep making the case for something better.</p>",

Other than that, he gets out of the way of the story \u2026 He has given the tales a new lease of life\". <strong>Adam Lively</strong> in the Sunday Times felt the same: \"Pullman meets \u2026 subtle and potentially contradictory demands with a skill that seems effortless, but in fact conceals considerable cunning and craft \u2026 the result is a magical complexity-in-simplicity that is sure to become a classic in its own right.\" For <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/grimm-tales-for-young-and-old-by-philip-pullman-8190082.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Christina Hardyment</strong> in the Independent</a> \"Pullman has chosen carefully; there are both old favourites and strikingly unusual tales.

According to <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/arts/book/captives-of-the-cold-war-8197069.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Simon Sebag Montefiore</strong> in the Evening Standard</a>, the book is \"a superb, revisionistic, brilliantly perceptive, often witty, totally gripping history, filled with colourful character sketches of Stalinist monsters, based on Soviet and local archives, on hundreds of interviews with survivors, and on the widest reading, that tells the dramatic, unknown and terrifying story of the Stalinisation of eastern Europe.\" <strong>Norman Stone </strong>in the Spectator understood that to make parts of \"this story readable is hideously difficult\", but he noted that \"Applebaum is very good on the process of grass-roots takeover: boy scouts, schools and universities, trade unions and the media.\" <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/arts/book/captives-of-the-cold-war-8197069.html\" title=\"\">The Mail on Sunday's <strong>Orlando Figes</strong></a> commented that, \"with the opening of Soviet-era archives, the story can at last be told. Applebaum is exceptionally well qualified to tell it. Her deep knowledge of the region, breadth of view and eye for human detail makes this as readable as her last book, on the Gulag.\" Finally, <strong>Peter Conradi</strong> in the Sunday Times wrote: \"In this exhaustive and entertainingly written account, Applebaum \u2026 captures well the absurdities of communist life familiar to anyone who experienced the system first hand.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's a common experience to enjoy a book by a particular author and then work through their backlist. Admirers of foreign-language novelists, though, face the complication that the works were often translated selectively or out of sequence.</p> <p><em>Silent House</em>, the 1983 second novel by Orhan Pamuk, arrives almost three decades overdue because, the reader may suspect, it was considered too parochially Turkish until the author's receipt of the 2006 Nobel prize for literature encouraged interest in the full range of his work. In Pamuk's case, part of the fascination of literary completism involves being a sort of time-travelling talent scout: might we, if somehow given access to Robert Finn's English translation 29 years ago, have spotted signs of the literary great Pamuk would become?</p> <p>Certainly, it is immediately clear that, as he has continued to do throughout his career <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/15/orhan-pamuk-turkey-oppression\" title=\"\">at risk of censure and censorship in his homeland</a>, the writer was working boldly close to contentious politics and history. <em>Silent House</em> is set in the prelude to the Turkish<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_coup_in_Turkey,_1980\" title=\"\"> military coup of 1980</a> and must have been largely written during the three-year regime of the army-led National Security Council.</p> <p>This history feels strongly present in the novel's governing metaphors of tradition, transition and inter-generational tension. A family reunion is taking place in a fishing village near Istanbul, where Fatma, the 90-year-old widow of a local doctor, is receiving a ritual summer visit from her grandchildren. The absence of the middle generation is explained by a sudden-death gene afflicting the clan, giving Fatma three graves to tend at the village cemetery and leaving the reader on alert for further bereavements.</p> <p>Apart from death, writing also runs in the family. One of Fatma's grandsons, Faruk, is following his father and grandfather in working on a manuscript which will seek to explain Turkey and the universe. The late doctor's project was an encyclopedia of everything, reminiscent of Mr Casaubon's in <em>Middlemarch</em>, although the Turkish physician was seeking, to the horror of his pious wife, to disprove the existence of God. Other cultural tensions within the country are represented, perhaps a little schematically. This was the period when the US and USSR were fighting a proxy cold war through the region, although one character reports a rumour that \"Carter and Brezhnev have secretly agreed to carve up Turkey\". If so, granddaughter Niljun, a leftist activist who buys the communist daily paper, would choose to live in the Soviet sector, while grandson Metin would take the mandate of the Georgian peanut farmer.</p> <p>However, the occupants of this ancient mansion are no longer in control of their own destiny. Fatma has a dwarf manservant, Recep, who readers know to be closer to the family than most of its members are aware, and whose nephew, Hasan, becomes the story's driving and destructive force.</p> <p>Hasan, in a prophetic historical shiver, looks neither to Russia nor America or even Turkey as his guide, but to Islam. He belongs to a group of politicised young men whose catch-phrase question is: \"Are you first a Muslim or a Turk?\" and who terrorise the local newsagents, destroying their copies of the communist press and tearing down pinups of women. To these firebrands, an Elvis Presley LP in a Turk's possession is evidence of treachery.</p> <p>The narrative climaxes with Hasan's pack literally colliding with two of Fatma's grandchildren. The significance of a driven car feels like a deliberate nod to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/classics/9780199536405/the-great-gatsby\" title=\"\"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a>, although the meaning of Pamuk's scene is different: the ancient clan may be at the wheel, but the fierce young believers represent the unstoppable force.</p> <p>This alertness to political undercurrents is not the only foreshadowing of the writer Pamuk would become in his maturity. The novel is also structurally highly ambitious, shifting, in alternate chapters, between the viewpoints of the grand-matriarch, the manservant, two of the grandchildren and Hasan. Within these well-differentiated voices, Pamuk also brings off a technically complex trick in which monologue is continually interrupted by the character speaking dialogue.</p> <p>Becoming available to English readers at a time when the media are daily reporting Turkey's potentially ominous border standoff with Syria, <em>Silent House</em> usefully illuminates the recent historical pressures on one combatant. And, 30 years on, the novel feels doubly prescient. As we witness the beginnings of a great writer, one of his characters, Hasan, predicts that, one day, Islamist young men such as he will be involved in a terrible event that will lead to people being \"shocked and amazed\" and put him on the newspapers and in TV. A novelist prescient enough to&#xa0;publish those sentences in&#xa0;1983 proved himself fully deserving of the call from the Swedish Academy in&#xa0;2006.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson's <em>Enough Is Enough</em> is published by Picador.</p>",
  "<p>As I was reading the first few pages of <em>Trouble in Toadpool</em>, the third of Anne Fine's wickedly funny books about the Mountfield family, a line from the film <em>Gladiator</em> suddenly popped into my head: \"At my signal, unleash hell,\" growls Russell Crowe's \u00fcber-tough guy Maximus. But even he and his fellow gladiators would blanch&#xa0;at the chaos unleashed by the Mountfields as they merrily demolish any fond illusions we might have about&#xa0;family life.</p> <p>The first two titles in the series \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780440867333/the-more-the-merrier\" title=\"\"><em>The More the Merrier</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780552559935/eating-things-on-sticks\" title=\"\"><em>Eating Things on Sticks</em></a> \u2013 anatomised The Family Christmas and The Family Holiday, revealing those hallowed institutions to be nothing more than nightmares of grumpiness and bad feeling. Now it's the turn of The Annual Summer F\u00eate \u2013 the kind of event that features stalls and entertainments, fortune telling and raffles, all of them clearly opportunities for rows and betrayals \u2013 to get a good kicking.</p> <p>The dramatis personae are much the same \u2013 Mum and Dad Mountfield, their sons Harry and Ralph, their appalling Great Granny, bossy Aunt Susan&#xa0;and her lisping, wannabe-star daughter Titania, and practical joker Uncle Tristram. The plot is simple: Aunt Susan browbeats her family into helping her put on \"The Great Toadpool Show\", hoping to ingratiate herself with the local politburo, aka The Toadpool Ladies' Charity Guild, but forgetting that her relatives are only&#xa0;capable of generating mayhem.</p> <p>Misunderstandings pile on mistakes, and conspiracies spiral out of control. Ralph finds himself committed to performing a trapeze act and spends most of his time trying to get out of it, while sibling rivalry breaks out among the adults. Great-Granny is a taciturn, malevolent figure, a cross between a golem and a troll, who comes into her own when given control of the Lucky Dip, where she scares off all customers.</p> <p>Things work out, of course, but not in the way you might have expected \u2013 which is all part of the fun in a comedy of this sort. Anne Fine is the kind of writer who creates great characters and puts them through their paces in scenes constructed so well you can't see the joins. She's also a keen observer of human nature \u2013 \"peeling back the nice surface of family life to show what's underneath\", as it says on her website. Some of her other work is very dark, but for all its chaos <em>Trouble in Toadpool</em> feels rather sunny.</p> <p>That's mostly to do with Ralph. We discover that he feels guilty about spoiling things for his cousin Titania in a previous story, and tries to make it up to her \u2013 without admitting anything. Cheerfulness keeps bursting in, with Kate Aldous's sparky black-and-white illustrations adding another layer of chirpiness. And although we might have to accept that hell is other people, particularly those we're related to, the lesson is that most of us muddle through, and put up with our nearest and dearest, however awful they are.</p> <p>I do have one quibble \u2013 I thought the whole putting-on-a-show-at-the-f\u00eate set-up just the teensiest bit contrived, and was a little too much of an Aunt Sally in comparison to the series' other targets. Which probably means I won't be getting an invitation to take part in a family event at Fine Towers any time soon. But since she also says on her website \"I'm always surprised murder in the domestic setting isn't more common,\" that's probably not a bad thing.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Bradman's <em>Viking Boy</em> is published by Walker.</p>",
  "<p>The day she visited the piece of land in Co Donegal on which she would build a house, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edna-o-brien\" title=\"\">Edna O'Brien</a> saw a rainbow over it, looping from Mount Errigal to the sea. This is what she writes: \"It faded slowly, with such cadence, getting fainter and fainter, the orange tint being the last to fade, a kind of tangerine.\" Look at that sentence. Just <em>look</em> at it. No one else could have written this: it is purest Edna O'Brien. Every rise and fall of it, every lift and sigh. The yearning in the word \"such\", the passion in the word \"cadence\", the fading of the word \"fade\", the lingering, scooping, last couple of clauses, giving us a colour that is not just orange but a surprising \u2013 almost contentious \u2013 \"tangerine\". This is a sentence that trails its fingers on the edge of the set as it leaves the stage. So get ready to applaud, ladies and gentlemen, because there is no one like her. O'Brien, in her 80s, may look like an icon and talk like an icon, but she writes like the thing itself, with prose that is scrupulous and lyrical, beautiful and exact.</p> <p>It is important to praise O'Brien because she has taken enough insults in her day. John Broderick, in the literary periodical Hibernia, \"quoting my husband's exact words \u2026 said that my 'talent resided in my knickers'\". Broderick, a novelist whose work was also banned in Ireland for sexual content, is 20 years dead, and whatever resided in his own knickers is long since turned to dust. It is easy, now, to see his misogyny but in the 1960s these things were not so simply understood. In her memoir, O'Brien says her supposed \"fault\" was not that she was a woman, but that she was thought \"glamorous\". Who could blame her for making this elision, of trying to rise above? The problem was not one of sex but of beauty, charisma, style. The problem was not the truths she told in those first novels \u2013 the ones that caused all the fuss \u2013 but of the fame those novels brought her because, for those years, fame and notoriety were a plane journey apart.</p> <p>O'Brien was not just a floozy, she was a floozy who lived in England, a floozy who was hugely successful in America; she was a standing annoyance to the small-town Irish literary male. The accusations shifted over the years \u2013 their content changed \u2013 but the emotion behind them remained somehow the same. <em>Country Girl</em> is far from being a bitter book, but O'Brien remembers these other slights too. Men suspected her of being \"an Amazon\", she says, while feminists tore into her for her \"supine, woebegone inclinations\". Hugh Leonard, another writer who is now dead, called over a restaurant in Dublin, for all to hear, \"the sneering insinuation that I was 'sleeping with Provos'\".</p> <p>In 1994, 30 years after the first furore, liberal Ireland was deeply unsettled when O'Brien interviewed the Sinn F\u00e9in leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gerryadams\" title=\"\">Gerry Adams</a>, glowingly, for the New York Times. She used Michael Collins, hero of the Irish war of independence, as a natural point of&#xa0;comparison: \"Whereas Collins was outgoing and swashbuckling, Gerry Adams is thoughtful and reserved.\" This was a fabulously transgressive take on Northern Irish politics; one that was not enhanced by the sexualisation of Adams, a \"lithe, handsome man\" whose eyes she describes in this memoir as \"vulpine\".</p> <p>The curious thing about the Adams article was the way it appeared at the darkest hour, two months before the surprising dawn that was the IRA ceasefire of April 1994. A secret tide had begun to turn in Northern Irish politics \u2013 how did O'Brien catch it so well? In this memoir, she does not discuss Dominic \"Mad Dog\" McGlinchey, the IRA separatist whom she interviewed in prison as part of her research for the book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781857992090/the-house-of-splendid-isolation\" title=\"\"><em>The House of Splendid Isolation</em></a>, and this is a pity. History might thank her for a few concrete details here, though we do not need them to admire the sensitivity of O'Brien's cultural barometer \u2013 talking to Gerry Adams, like having premarital sex, is now a respectable thing to do. O'Brien is attracted to taboos just as they break, to the place of greatest heat and darkness and, you might even say, danger to her mortal soul. She may not always escape free of what the journalist Fintan O'Toole calls \"moral fault\", but that's as may be. You cannot make someone a pariah and then complain when she goes rogue.</p> <p>O'Brien does not see herself as being in control of her muse. \"It had written itself,\" she says of her first novel, \"I was merely the messenger.\" And later, in middle age: \"The words would not come,\" as though she was just a conduit for writing, not a writer at all. This may be a kind of abnegation, but it is also an astonishingly vulnerable and courageous way to live. O'Brien is the great, the only, survivor of forces that silenced and destroyed who knows how many other Irish women writers, and her contradictions \u2013 her evasions even \u2013 must be regarded as salutary.</p> <p>She is a woman unafraid of sex, who is terrified of swimming; a woman who defied the Catholic church, but who cannot do thunderstorms, driving, being alone. She reserves the right to be both fabulous and infuriating. Why, you might ask, does someone of her verve and achievement, financially independent, someone who did so much for the cause of sexual self-realisation, only fall for married men? Maybe it was for the books \u2013 at least, books were the end result of her seeming confusions. \"It was easier,\" she has said in interview, \"to be a writer and a mother than a writer and a wife.\"</p> <p>There are two great shadows in this memoir. The first is her father, a drinker, shouter and gambler, and the second is her husband, Ernest Gebler, a controlling and disappointed man who was jealous of her talent. \"It was as if by writing I had taken the ground from under his feet,\" she writes, though this is not the first instance she gives of a dispute over land. The memoir opens with an unseemly wrangle during her mother's last illness over who would inherit the family farm. It goes to her brother \u2013 the only son \u2013 leaving O'Brien outraged in her grief. In fact most of the land is already gone, gambled away piecemeal by their father, decades before. The childhood section of <em>Country Girl</em> is littered with objects that were lost, or stolen, or given away, all of them remembered with great particularity. A silver spoon, from a set of six is kept in a velvet-lined case, \"the velvet faded and milky\". A china doll, purloined by O'Brien's teacher when she lends it for a school nativity play, wears \"an ivory satin dress strewn with violets\". Her mother's shoes, taken by a passing Traveller woman, are recalled down to the \"little worms of shoe cream in the punched holes along the toe cap\". A court case to recover them brings nothing but shame when her mother is \"jeered and laughed at by two warring tribes of tinkers\". The shoes, she says, \"were never the same after that\".</p> <p>The O'Brien homestead, Drewsboro, was a house in decline: the remnants of its grandeur are given as sops to the persecutory peasantry that surrounded it. This unequal trade continues in O'Brien's early sexual adventures. After an episode in the bushes, she gives the girl who led her astray \"a georgette handkerchief with a pink powder puff stitched into it\". The man who deflowers her is sent \"the one book I treasured\", a copy of <em>The Charwoman's Daughter</em> by James Stephens \u2013 a moving gift he in no way deserves. Anonymous, denouncing letters appear at key moments in O'Brien's story, and the sense of persecution by locals is repeated when she builds her \"large\" house in Co Donegal. \"Each evening, after they left the site, the cement blocks they had put up were being removed, before they had hardened, and thrown down in defiance.\"</p> <p>O'Brien does not forget the many kindnesses offered to her when she was lost and alone in London, and though she found a new kind of grandeur among the famous, she still manages to namecheck her babysitter \u2013 50 years after the fact \u2013 in the same sentence as she mentions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\" title=\"\">Paul McCartney</a>. There is a difference between her daily life and the dark tides that shaped her creativity, but it might be said that she faced losses and persecutions that were both mythic and real and that the books she wrote were, as a result, great acts of reclamation. One after the other, we stumble across them in her prose; the perfect object, perfectly recalled: \"a baby's matinee coat with picot edging\", \"a linen napkin in a bone ring\", a dressing gown that is \"fawn and hairy\", a chop with \"a plump red kidney attached\", a bunch of altar chrysanthemums that had \"a sad smell of clay\". When the farm help, Carnero, arrives at a house in which she is being tormented as a child, he is holding \"a cushion to put on the bar of the bicycle on which he would bring me home\".</p> <p>O'Brien knows the precise emotional weight of objects, their seeming hopefulness and their actual indifference to those who seek to be consoled. She is in thrall to artifice, the way it holds desire. As a child she gazes with \"rapture\" at a \"great amphora of artificial tea roses in yellow and red, far more beautiful than the dog roses on the briars\". As an old woman, she sits in the wreck of that same house, looking at the wallpaper in her mother's bedroom where she can just discern \"the dipping branches on which tiny pink rosebuds hung, so lifelike on their thin stalks that I used to believe they would bloom\".</p> <p>On one of her earliest manuscripts, Gebler wrote a fatal note. \"There is no such thing as a blue road.\" To this she replies \u2013 she has been replying, one way or another, all her life \u2013 \"I knew there was. I had seen them \u2026 Roads were every colour, blue, grey, gold, sandstone and carmine.\" Is this the root of the (usually male, let's face it) unease about O'Brien; the worry she might become untethered from the real? It is the tension between the actual and the metaphorical that gives her sentences their enormous energy and restraint, though in her middle work, the balance does not always hold. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/rd-laing\" title=\"\">RD Laing</a>, \"half-Lucifer, half-Christ\", filled her full of LSD and then \"sent me packing with an opened scream\". As a result, there is a whole section of this memoir where she describes her dreams as you might describe the evening news. When she told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/10/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Norman Mailer</a> the gist of a novel she planned to write, he shook his head, said it was too interior, \"then repeated it, 'You're too interior, that's your problem.'\"</p> <p>The influence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesjoyce\" title=\"\">Joyce</a> is everywhere in O'Brien's work, and her discussion of his style is a manifesto for her own: \"the lush descriptions of corpses and steers and pigs and kine, and sea and sea stones, and then the extraordinary ascensions in which worlds within worlds unfolded.\" He was such a girl, Joyce. Mailer might have found him too interior, though he would never have kissed him, shyly, in a church in Brooklyn while sheltering from the rain. It was a funny time, the late 20th century, when men wrote like men, and women wrote like women, and then everybody said mean things about who was right and who was just whoring around. And if you ask me, it wasn't Edna.</p> <p>\u2022 Anne Enright's <em>The Forgotten Waltz</em> is published by Vintage.</p>",

The cuisine is seafood-heavy, with an abundance of lobster and clams. (Wood-oven roasted mussels are a speciality at <strong>Fore Street</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.forestreet.biz\" title=\"\">forestreet.biz</a>.)

  "<p>Let the dawn rise behind you, and drive on towards the sunset. The great American road trip goes west, not east, and it ends at the barrier of the Pacific Ocean. Westward like the pioneers, you travel through ever bigger, emptier and more dramatic landscapes. The skies get taller. The horizons stretch out. You reach the great national parks of the Rockies, where wolves and bears and something close to wilderness still exists, and drive on through the red rock canyonlands of Utah and Arizona.</p> <p>The worst mistake is to be in a hurry. The drive from New York to California is 2,800 miles if you make the mistake of taking the most direct route. If you loop and detour as you should, it's closer to 3,500 miles, and you want at least 10 days and preferably three weeks or more. Use the interstate highways when you have long stretches to cross, but be sure to meander down plenty of backroads.</p> <p>Unless you have the sort of personality that can't stand it any other way, keep the planning to a minimum. A cross-country road trip should be a loose, freewheeling, improvisational adventure, full of surprises and sudden friendships with extraordinary strangers.</p> <p>Bars are always good places to meet people. So are independent bookstores \u2013 where they survive. The staff invariably know the best places to eat and drink locally, and if there happens to be a cool band playing that night, or a wrestling contest in the back of a local feed store, they can usually tell you about that too. Be observant. America is a land of many signs and billboards, and this is how you'll find your way to, say, the World's Largest Prairie Dog, or a saloon called something like Bad Barb's Vapors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644698\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967311338/Richard-Grant-001.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Grant\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Grant on the road</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If a weird rock formation glimpsed off in the distance looks appealing, get yourself over there.

These days I'm not so pure. I like a dependable vehicle and I stay in motels until I reach the western deserts and mountains. Then I look for remote public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (<a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html\" title=\"\">blm.gov/wo/st/en.html</a>) where I can camp for free and build a fire, usually without sticking to a designated area. I pack a sleeping bag and sometimes a tent, and I never get on the road without a camp stove, an espresso pot, and a pound or two of good ground coffee. Motel and gas station coffee is almost uniformly awful. A bottle of whiskey is a true friend if you find yourself in a dry county down south, and a gallon of water can quite literally save your life if you break down on a desert backroad in summer. I also pack a knife, fork, matches, can-opener and corkscrew, and a small grill to prop over a campfire.</p> <p>Gastronomic despair is a real possibility, especially on interstates. The same fast food restaurants cluster at every exit \u2014 Mickey-D's, Burger Thing, Junk In The Box, Pizza Butt, Dead Lobster and Taco Hell. There are now websites devoted to eating well across the country, and while I check them obsessively in gas stations and motels, the results are usually disappointing. The websites are crowd-sourced, which means that most of the reviewers don't know what they're talking about. <a href=\"http://chowhound.chow.com/boards\" title=\"\">Chowhound.com</a> is the best of them, but I'd advise looking up the recommendations of top American food writers such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2002/oct/13/foodanddrink.features5\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Steingarten</a> or Jonathan Gold.</p> <p>The most direct route across the US takes you through the flat cornfields of the Midwest, where American food, and arguably American culture, is at its least zesty. I advise a more southerly course, for the music and storytelling and because the south has barbecue. The meat, which is usually pork shoulder and ribs until you reach Texas, where it changes to beef brisket, is rubbed or marinated with spices and tenderisers, and then cooked slowly for many hours over woodsmoke in a pit or chamber. Hot damn! Done right, it's amazingly succulent and tangy, and there are dozens of regional variations. An Alabama prison guard once told me his favourite barbecue was \"so good it make you wanna hurt somebody!\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967238887/Mississippi-Riverboat-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mississippi Riverboat\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A riverboat on the Mississippi.

If the blues sounds good in Clapham, try listening to Muddy Waters or Fred McDowell when driving through the swamps and cotton fields of the Mississippi delta. Better yet, stop off in a raw backcountry juke joint, buy a pint of moonshine from the man outside and hear the last surviving bluesmen playing it live. You will feel very foreign, but not unwelcome.</p> <p>Tom Waits has a knack for getting you through the last miles to a motel when you're dead tired. When you're driving through a thunderstorm at night on the high plains of Colorado, try Bob Dylan. Gram Parsons sounds just right in the desert, and so do the new tripped-out DJ sounds of Gonjasufi.</p> <p>The first time I drove across the country, I felt so liberated and happy \u2013 and so dejected when we reached the end of the road and stared out at the Pacific. So I drove back the other way to New Orleans, and then up to Montana, and down to Arizona. For a couple of years, I lived on the road, sleeping in cars and tents and other people's houses, doing odd jobs and pieces of journalism. You hear a lot of windy nonsense trumpeted about freedom in America, especially by politicians, but when you're roaming around the enormous public lands of the American west, sleeping next to a different campfire every night, you're about as free as you can realistically get in this day and age, and that's the best reason there is to hit the road.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Read more about Richard's travels at </em><a href=\"http://www.richardgrant.us/\" title=\"\"><em>richardgrant.us</em></a><em>.

  "<p>One of the most unhappy sagas in English football's history of club ownership may finally be nearing its conclusion after the Football League declined to approve the bid by the Hong Kong-based businessman Balram Chainrai to take over Portsmouth again. The league's board, at its meeting on Thursday, reached no definitive conclusion but it is understood to have significant doubts about accepting Chainrai's British Virgin Islands-registered company, Portpin, as the owner of the traumatised south coast club.</p> <p>Portsmouth's administrators, the accountants PKF, are expected to resume discussions next week with the Pompey Supporters Trust over its proposal to take the club over. PKF may then present the league with the trust's bid to own Portsmouth, via a one-member-one-vote mutual democratic form of ownership, as its preferred bidder.</p> <p>A central issue the league is known to have considered is whether Chainrai may not pass the \"fit and proper person test\", now known as the \"owners and directors'\" test, were he to buy Portsmouth back from a second period in administration in two years. One of the league rules is that a person cannot own a football club or be a director if he has previously twice been a director or owner of a club when it has fallen into administration.</p> <p>Chainrai was the owner when Portsmouth went into administration the first time, in February 2010. He then sold the club to Vladimir Antonov, the owner of Snoras, a Lithuanian bank, but in November Antonov was arrested on suspicion of large-scale bank fraud, which he denies.</p> <p>That plunged Pompey into crisis again and in February they fell into administration for a second time. During that latter period Portpin had retained a charge over Fratton Park and the club's assets, to secure \u00a317m which he loaned into the club during the early months of his first involvement.</p> <p>The league is understood to be examining whether, after Antonov's arrest and the collapse of his Portsmouth ownership, Chainrai in effect controlled affairs at the club. If Chainrai were, in practice, in executive control of Portsmouth at that time, the league is concerned that this could amount to his having been acting as a \"shadow director\".</p> <p>According to league rules, acting as a shadow director counts, as does being a formally registered director, as executive involvement in a club. So, if Chainrai was acting to that extent in directing Portsmouth's affairs, that would mean he was a shadow director when the club went into administration a second time. That second involvement would bar him from being a \"fit and proper person\" under the league rules.</p> <p>Chainrai, a spokesman said, \"categorically denies\" he \"exercised any level of control\" over Portsmouth during the period of the second administration.</p> <p>Chainrai's position is that he was still owed \u00a317m, secured by the charge over the club and Fratton Park, but he did not take a role in running the club in the lead-up to it being forced into administration due to the collapse of Antonov's funding.</p> <p>Members of the league's executive, led by its chief operating officer, Andy Williamson, met Portpin representatives last week to discuss Portpin's proposals, which were presented by PKF as the administrator's preferred bid. The league is understood to have presented Portpin with a list of questions and outstanding issues, including the company's ownership structure, the source of Chainrai's funds, details about the running of the club \u2013 and, centrally, this question of Chainrai's involvement leading up to the second plunge into administration.</p> <p>The league's board met on Thursday, with the Portpin bid for Portsmouth, presented by PKF, on the agenda. The league issued no statement and would not discuss the outcome of the meeting but it is clear that the questions over Portpin's bid were not answered in full or satisfactorily. The league has outstanding concerns over Chainrai's involvement and other details and so, to agree a sale of the club and bring the club out of administration, PKF is likely to turn to the trust, whose bid does not carry such baggage.</p> <p>It is not straightforward, however, because the trust would have to buy the ground, with Chainrai releasing his charge. The trust has had Fratton Park professionally valued at between \u00a31.6m and \u00a32.75m. That is nowhere near the \u00a317m Chainrai is owed for loans he put into Portsmouth when he first became involved towards the end of 2009. If Chainrai were to reject the trust's offer for Fratton Park, PKF might have to seek a court's approval for it as a fair offer, which would be complicated and expensive.</p> <p>So the fate of Portsmouth, a ruined casualty of football's moneyed era, limps towards a conclusion, between a mutual, democratic trust of lifelong supporters, and a lender of money, based in Hong Kong.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden's claim that \"we weren't told\" of requests by US diplomatic security officials to increase protection in Libya ahead of the killing of ambassador Chris Stevens may be true in a narrow sense. The White House on Friday claimed Biden was speaking \"directly for himself and the president\".</p> <p>But Republicans seized on the remark, made by the vice-president in Thursday night's debate. They said it flew in the face of testimony by US security officials who told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that repeated requests for more protection, including memos from Stevens, were rejected by Washington.</p> <p>So what's the truth?</p> <p><strong>Wednesday's congressional hearing was severely embarrassing for the Obama administration.</strong></p> <p>The hearing exposed the administration to charges of incompetence over its initial failure to correctly identify the nature and scale of the assault on the Benghazi consulate, which led to the deaths of Stevens and three other Americans.</p> <p>It also provided a wealth of evidence that the state department ignored serial warnings not only from its own security personnel on the ground but two ambassadors to Libya \u2013 Stevens and his predecessor, Gene Cretz \u2013 about the growing threat from armed Islamist militias. The diplomats not only made failed appeals for more protection but had to fight to maintain existing security staffing levels.</p> <p>However, no evidence was presented that the issue was ever aired outside of the state department, or that it was a matter that would or should have been referred to the White House. And the picture that emerged at the hearings was more complex than the Republicans portray it to be.</p> <p>The Republicans are also open to charges of having contributed to the debacle in Libya. They forced hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to the state department security budget over the past two years which contributed to the fight over personnel levels.</p> <p><strong>At the congressional hearings, Eric Nordstrom, who was responsible for protecting US diplomats in Libya until July, said that state department officials in Washington were repeatedly warned about a perpetual and deepening concern over security</strong>.</p> <p>\"In spring of 2012 we noted an increasing number of attacks and incidents which appeared to target foreign affiliated organisations. In response to these incidents we implemented a number of changes to our security posture,\" he said.</p> <p>Among them was an appeal to the Libyan government to provide better protection, and a request for a US military team that was due to be pulled out to remain while a Libyan security force was trained.</p> <p>\"We reiterated our request at all levels of government for a consistent armed host nation security force to support the mission. We also requested security staffing and extensions of the DOD (department of defence) security support team. In my opinion, the primary security staffing issue that we dealt with was maintaining US security personnel, whether diplomatic security agents or security support team members, for sufficient amount of time to allow the full training and deployment of a local bodyguard unit,\" Nordstrom said.</p> <p>Nordstrom said that requests in November and March to extend the temporary deployment of a unit of 15 \"security professionals\", in addition to the standing force of 24, were agreed by the state department. But appeals for more agents were turned down.</p> <p>\"All of us at post were in sync that we wanted these resources,\" he said.</p> <p>Nordstrom told the committee that he was warned against pressing the request for additional personnel by a senior state department official responsible for handling it, Charlene Lamb, because \"there would be too much political cost\".</p> <p>But Nordstrom said he went ahead anyway.</p> <p>He also recalled his frustration when he asked a regional director for more security forces. Nordstrom said the official replied: \"You're asking for the sun, the moon and the stars.\"</p> <p>Nordstrom said that he replied: \"You know what is the most frustrating about this assignment? It's not the hardships, it's not the gunfire, it's not the threats. It's dealing, and fighting, against the people, programmes and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me. And I added to it by saying: 'For me, the Taliban is on the inside of the building.'\"</p> <p><strong>Shortly before Nordstrom left Libya he sent a memo to the state department asking for a further extension of the 15-plus to keep a six-agent training team working with the new Libyan guard force the US was building.</strong></p> <p>Nordstrom said he and other officials were alarmed at the prospect that \"we couldn't even keep what we had\", let alone increase the size of the security force.</p> <p>The following month, Stevens sent a memo, presented to the congressional committee, asking for another 11 security agents to be added to the standing force. That request was not met by the time Stevens died.</p> <p>However, the state department points out that the additional forces were all to be posted in Tripoli not Benghazi, where the assault on the consulate killed the ambassador. The hearing also heard that Nordstrom's memos did not press for additional security staff in Benghazi.</p> <p>But there is still a dispute about who wanted how many security agents at the consulate.</p> <p><strong>Nordstrom's July cable requested a standing force of three US security agents in Benghazi, the crucible of last year's revolution, which was the number posted there at the time of the attack.</strong> However he said that there had previously been five.</p> <p>\"It was that number five which DS [the state department] had committed to which we continued to ask them to meet throughout my time there,\" he said.</p> <p>Lamb said that the number of agents had fallen by two because one was being used as a driver and the other as a technician, and those are not roles normally filled by security personnel. So they were replaced with other people.</p> <p>Lamb said that was agreed by Nordstrom. \"Post had agreed that three was sufficient number on the ground,\" she said.</p> <p>The US under-secretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, told the hearing that two agents travelled with Stevens from Tripoli, bringing the total at the Benghazi consulate on the day of the attack to the five \u2013 the number Nordstrom told the committee he wanted.</p> <p>\"There were five diplomatic security special agents on the compound the evening of September 11 and there were three additional armed security personnel provided by the government of Libya,\" said Kennedy.</p> <p>Lamb said: \"We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi on the night of 9/11.\"</p> <p>She also noted that security officers at the embassy in Tripoli could have sent additional agents with Stevens had they wanted to. </p> <p><strong>However, the view that the permanent security staff at Benghazi was insufficient was backed by lieutenant colonel Andrew Wood, former head of embassy protection in Libya.</strong></p> <p>\"The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there \u2026 Diplomatic security remained weak,'' he said. \"The RSO (regional security officer) struggled to obtain additional personnel there, but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with.\"</p> <p>The dispute over the numbers of American security personnel overlooks that the state department policy all along has been to train up a Libyan force for protection.</p> <p>Nordstrom said: \"Our long-term security plan in Libya was to deploy an armed, locally-hired Libyan bodyguard unit.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, Nordstrom told the hearing, the new Libyan administration was in disarray and could not provide security. He said a militia loyal to the government, the 17 February Martyrs Brigade, was doing so and were stationed inside the US consulate compound.</p> <p>\"We could not rely on the Libyan government for security, intelligence and law enforcement help to identify emerging threats or to ask them for assistance in mitigating those threats. In Benghazi, however, the government of Libya through the 17 February Martyrs Brigade was able to provide us consistent armed security since the very earliest days of the revolution,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Nordstrom suggested that it might in any case have been difficult to protect the consulate in any circumstance.</strong> </p> <p>\"I had not seen an attack of such ferocity and intensity previously in Libya, nor in my time with the diplomatic security service,\" he said. \"I'm concerned that this attack signals a new security reality, just as the 1983 Beirut marine barracks bombings did for the marines, the 1998 east Africa embassy bombings did for the state department \u2013 and just as 9/11 did for our entire country.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Let's face it, on the balance of probability and the evidence of what we've seen so far, neither Wales nor Scotland has a snowball's chance in hell of qualifying for Brazil 2014.

And Scott Brown to get sent off in what he deems a fair tackle, but leaves someone in a coma.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bMZxWoAnZTI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bMZxWoAnZTI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Not long now:</strong> The teams amble out of the tunnel, with Sky's man in the commentary box saying that this is \"a crunch domestic international\" where is a draw is of little use to man or beast. </p> <p>Go-to girl Katherine Jenkins must be on tour, as Welsh Soprano Gwawr Edwards will be singing the national anthems tonight. She steps forward to the microphone and begins singing to a chorus of PA feedback and fan feedback in the form of a chorus of wolf-whistles. Here's a clip of Gwawr singing Santa Baby, just to give you a feel for what's going on.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Scotland kick off.</strong> Their players are kitted out in white shirts and socks and black shorts. The Welsh wear red shirts, shorts and socks.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Steven Fletcher is penalised for offside within 20 seconds, as he tries to get on the end of an Allan McGregor hoick up the field. Ben Davies takes the free-kick. It's another long ball and Steve Morison is promptly flagged for offside. Only a minute in and this is already like a game of rugby.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> David Vaughan gets a reducer in on Scott Brown, leaving a calling card early doors. German referee Florian Meyer sprints over to the scene of the assault, gesticulates furiously at Vaughan and gives him a stern ticking-off. He decides not to leave his calling card early doors and keeps his yellow in his pocket.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Now Scott Brown feels the lash of the referee's tongue after being penalised for a cynical shoulder on - I think - Darcy Blake. One for the purists, this. It could be a long evening.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Another free-kick, this time for a Joe Allen foul over near the touchline near the halfway line.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> \"Your photo seems to show a Scottish player (I'm guessing Fletcher) doing a remarkable impression of Jonny Wikinson,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst. \"They do know that it's supposed to go under the bar, don't they? Even against supreme egg-chasers Wales. Maybe that's why they don't score very often.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> The ball remains on the deck for long enough for Gareth Bale to try a shot from all of 35 yards out. He sends his effort comically high over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Darren Fletcher bodychecks Aaron Ramsey about five yards oputside the Wales penalty area as the Arsenal midfielder tries to turn and embark on a counter-attack. The ref blows his whistle <em>again</em>.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Gareth Bale gets in behind left-back Danny Fox to latch on to a splendid pass down the wing from Chris Gunther. He cuts inside Christophe Berra and tries to lash the ball around Allan McGregor and inside the far post, but sends it wide. It's an optimistic effort that was always unlikely to come off - Steve Morison won't be too happy with that, as he was well placed and screaming for a pass.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> The camera cuts to Craig Levein on the Scotland bench. He's wearing a navy blue and gold tie and generously offers chewing gum to the guy sitting to his right. The guy declines. Levein shrugs and returns the chewing gum to his inside jacket pocket. Who the hell keeps it in there?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Joe Ledley fouls Kris Commons, conceding a free-kick down near the corner flag outside his own penalty area. Commons swings the ball in towards the far post and James Morrison leaps. The West Brom midfielder is penalised for something or other, but I'm not sure what. He doesn't look too sure either.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Wales have probably settled the better of the two teams thus far, but the possession stats are about even and the home side seem to be relying a bit too much on lumping long balls towards Steve Morison, who isn't being given a sniff by Gary Caldwell and Christophe Berra. To be fair to the Norwich City striker, the service he's trying to feed off is dreadful.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Wales blow a great chance. Joe Allen robbed Kris Commons of possession inside the Scotland half and played the ball forward to Aaron Ramsey. Ramsey went rampaging into space, with Morison ahead of him to the right and Allen overlapping on his left. He played the ball to Allen, who cut inside the penalty area and took so long to unleash a shot that, when he finally tried to get the ball away, his effort was easily smothered.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Gareth Bale! Gareth Bale! Running down the wing! Gareth Bale! Gareth Bale! Sends the football in! On this occasion his cross to the far post is perfect, Morison rises above Hutton, only to head across the face of goal and wide. That's a shocking miss.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Wales 0-1 Scotland (Morrison 26):</strong> Goal-kick ... flick-on ... goal! Liquid football from Scotland.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Goals don't get much simpler than that. After Morison's dreadful miss, Allan McGregor took the kick-out. He wellied the ball as far as he could, Steven Fletcher out-jumped Joe Allen to flick it behind him and James Morrison ran between defenders to steer it past Lewis Price and into the bottom right-hand corner with his first touch.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Scotland win a free-kick about 40 yards from the Wales goal. Fox and Commons stand over the ball. Fox tries one from the training ground, curling the ball down the inside right to Steven Fletcher, who'd made a run. The intention was clearly for Fletcher to square the ball across the edge of the six-yard box, but Fox's delivery was over-hit and over the striker's left shoulder. It runs out of play.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Remember Gareth Bale's goal against Serbia from a free-kick about 30 yards out? Well, he gets the chance to score a similar one after Gary Caldwell is booked for a late lunge across the bows of Joe Ledley. He shanks the ball into the Scottish fans behind Allan McGregor's goal.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Kris Commons puts Allan McGregor under pressure with a sloppy backpass, but the Besiktas goalkeeper remains composed enough to clear the danger.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Ben Davies tries a long range effort for Wales after a decent cross from Gareth Bale is headed his way by a Scottish defender. High and wide. Moments previously, Steven Fletcher had spurned a decent opportunity to put Scotland two up, failing to connect with the ball from seven yards after it bounced kindly for him upon being sent in from the left wing.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Gareth Bale turns on the afterburners and skins Fox and Maloney down the right wing. He cuts inside and crosses the ball to Ramsey at the near post, but the Arsenal midfielder puts the ball wide. That's splendid play from Bale, who is lording it down the right wing. If Wales can get the ball to him more often, he could wreak all sorts of havoc.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>43 min: </strong> James Morrison spurns another great opportunity. The ball's zinged in from the right and Steven Fletcher's knockdown was perfect and bounces up for Morrison, but he couldn't keep his effort down and sends the ball fizzing over the ball from about 10 yards out.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> There'll be one minute of added time, which is plenty of time for Kris Commons to take a corner. His delivery is absolutely atrocious and sails high over everyone's heads. If I was a manager I'd fine players for doing that or failing to clear the first defender, but then I suppose nobody would ever volunteer to take corners.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half-time: </strong> Scotland go in a goal to the good after an entertaining first half. There have been full blooded tackles, cynical fouls, several decent chances and terrible misses galore, with occasional touches of class from a select handful of players. In short, pretty much what you'd expect from an encounter between these two sides.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Second half:</strong> Wales kick off. Scotland have made a change for the second half, with Charlie Adam replacing Scott Brown, who was carrying a hip injury.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Aaron Ramsey picks up the ball in the centre-circle and tries to ping the ball wide to Chris Gunther on the touchline. His pass is inaccurate and over-hit, leaving the right-back with no chance.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Wales win a free-kick in a good position, wide on the right on the edge of the final third. Gareth Bale's delivery is poor and fails to clear the first defender. It's genuinely shocking that a player of his undoubted quality is incapable of doing better when his team is a goal down at home in a must-win game.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Wales goakeeper Lewis Price puts the ball out for a corner after nudging a looping Alan Hutton cross wide of his own goal. He probably could have left it but it was one of those ones that <em>might</em> have looped in the angle of crossbar and upright.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Gareth Bale scampers down the inside right with the ball at his feet. With kicks the ball ahead of him and chases it, prompting Danny Fox to slide in with the tackle. It's perfectly timed, which is just as well for the Scottish full-back, as Bale would almost certainly have hooked his foot around his marker's shin and gone to ground if he'd missed the ball.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> \"So, what do you do at half time?\" asks Ian H. \"Are you really so tired from 45 mins of intermittent typing that you can't describe the stadium pies or beer?\" </p> <p>That's harsh, Ian. Generally, at half-time, I take time out to sit here in my Kings Cross office and idly wonder if there's anybody out there who thinks I'm typing this in the stadium where the match is being played.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Wales centre-half Darcy Blake goes down injured and is sent to the sideline for treatment. He doesn't look to chipper, but is fit enough to continue.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Aaron Ramsey and David Vaughan pass the ball between themselves a few yards outside the Scotland penalty area, wondering what to do next. Gareth Bale makes a round down the right flank, inviting Vaughan to play the ball into space for him. The Sunderland midfielder tries to do exactly that, but over-hits his pass and smashes the ball wide. On the touchline, Wales manager Chris Coleman goes a bit bonkers.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> \"Fining players for poor corners?\" asks Matt Dony? \"You'd have a rather draconian approach to management; not what I'd expect from a liberal, namby-pamby guardianista. It's how the Nazis got started!\" </p> <p>The Nazi's got started by fining football players for taking poor corners? Really? I did not know that. Meanwhile in Dublin, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/12/world-cup-qualifiers-ireland-germany-live\">Ireland have just gone 4-0 down against Germany</a>. That could get a lot worse with half an hour to go.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Aaron Ramsey's evening goes from bad to worse - he's booked for a challenge on Alan Hutton which will rule him out of Wales next match against Croatia.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Things go from worse to catastrophic for Ireland and Aaron Ramsey. The Irish go 5-0 down in Dublin, while Ramsey is denied what looked a penalty after going down under a challenge from Charlie Adam in the Scotland penalty area.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Replays show there was no contact between Ramsey and Adam just inside the Scotland penalty area. That's a great shout by the referee - I was certain it was a penalty, but it seems Ramsey was chancing his arm.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Scotland attack down the right flank. Morrison shoots from a tight angle, bringing a fairly straightforward save out of Lewis Price when Steven Fletcher was screaming for the ball at the far post. To be fair to Morrison, he did look up and seemed to decide that he'd be unable to get the ball to Fletcher from such close range with a defender standing between them.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Gareth Bale is put through on goal, shows splendid close control to draw the keeper and then lifts it over McGregor and wide when it looked easier to score. That's Wales eighth attempt on goal, none of which have been on target.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> The action has been so frenetic that I haven't yet had a chance to mention the penalty Wales <em>should</em> have been awarded, moments after the one they were denied. The ball was crossed in from the right and on the edge of the six-yard box, Christophe Berra just wrapped his arms around the substitute Craig Davies (on for Steve Morison) and just wrestled him to the ground. Quite how the referee or linesman didn't spot that is a mystery.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Joe Allen is booked for a foul on James Morrison. It's a fair cop; he'd been skinned for pace in a dangerous area and had no real choice but to clip the Scotland midfielder's heels.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Charlie Adam dinks a splendid cross to the far post, where an unopposed Steven Fletcher heads the ball home from close range and wheels away in celebration. The ref blows his whistle to disallow the goal and everyone presumes it's for offside. Replays show Fletcher was emphatically onside, so I have no idea why what looked a perfectly legitimate goal was chalked off. If I had to guess, I'd say he or his linesman <em>might</em> have thought Adam's cross curled out of play and came back in again before Fletcher got on the end of it. Replays show that it didn't.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Wales win a corner and Ramsey sends an outswinger to the far post. Scotland clear. Wales substitution I haven't had a chance to tell you about because the action here is so non-stop: Joe Ledley off, Reading winger Hal Robson-Kanu on.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Gareth Bale leaves a couple of Scotland defenders in his dust, sprints into the Scotland penalty area and with Shaun Maloney on the chase, kicks the back of his own leg and hits the deck. Penalty.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Wales 1-1 Scotland (Bale 80pen):</strong> Bale doesn't let his conscience get the better of him and coolly slots the penalty home, waiting for McGregor to make his move before putting the ball into the bottom left-hand corner. </p> <p>There's absolutely no question that Bale dived to the ground there after clipping his own heels - he has now apparently reached a point in his career where he's happy to eschew perfectly decent goalscoring opportunities in order to win penalties, which I find a bit depressing.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> To be fair to Bale, that wasn't a decent goalscoring opportunity. He was being forced wide of goal along the right-hand side of the penalty area. He still took a dive, mind. Considering the history between them, it was no surprise that Charlie Adam was the first over to Bale to remonstrate with him for his chicanary.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> This second half has been magnificently entertaining and played out at such an incident-packed lick that I'm finding it very difficult to keep up. There's so much happening - if there are highlights available in your neck of the woods this evening, they'll be well worth a look. Kenny Miller and Jamie Mackie are on for Scotland. Kris Commons and somebody else have made way.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Aaron Ramsey has been dire this evening. Really awful. A couple of minutes ago, a wayward backpass gave his goalkeeper Lewis Price a dreadful case of the heebie jeebies.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Wales 2-1 Scotland (Bale 89)</strong> In torrential rain from at least 25 yards out, Gareth Bale rifles a diagonal surface-to-air <em>screamer</em> into the top right-hand corner. That's real Roy of the Rovers stuff - an extraordinary goal.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> That was an astonishing goal. Wales won a free-kick in the centre-circle, just inside the Scotland half. They took it short and Bale jogged forward with the ball at his feet, not appearing top have much idea of what to do next. </p> <p>Charlie Adam was ponderous in the extreme when it came to closing him down, choosing instead to just amble forwards a bit and edge Bale a bit wide. The winger jinked to his left, cut inside and from the edge of the penalty area, sent an unstoppable fizzing drive past Allan McGregor and into the top corner.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> On the touchline, Craig Levein is wet through, cutting an extremely forlorn figure in his drenched suit, with rivulets of rainwater running down the lenses of his spectacles.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep!</strong> It's all over. Wales have won their first match under Chris Coleman, to move ahead of Scotland in Group A and put Craig Levein under immense pressure. That was a splendidly entertaining football match, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that neither of these teams will need to go scouting hotels in Brazil for the next World Cup.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Elsewhere in this group:</strong> Croatia came from behind to beat the mysterious Macedonians away from home, while Belgium take all three points home from their visit to Serbia. Back in Cardiff, we saw both sides of Gareth Bale in a much-needed win, His team-mates celebrated at the final whistle like they'd just won the World Cup, rather than edged a scarcely deserved home win over a very poor Scotland side.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here from around 7pm. Here's David Hytner's match preview:</p> <blockquote> <p>Joachim L\u00f6w called it a \"very fruitful discussion\". To everyone else, it sounded like a very loud argument. The Germany manager admitted that Bastian Schweinsteiger had given him a \"piece of his mind\" and L\u00f6w had not agreed at all with the Bayern Munich midfielder.</p> <p>The issue under discussion was the unity of the Nationalmannschaft, who are here to face Giovanni Trapattoni's injury-hit Republic of Ireland in World Cup qualification. Schweinsteiger had questioned it when he said \"the whole bench didn't jump up\" to celebrate goals at the European Championship and his comments have sparked a high profile sideshow.</p> <p>Mario G\u00f6tze and Toni Kroos had complained in public about their lack of playing minutes at Euro 2012 and L\u00f6w added here that \"some players were not overly happy to have to sit on the bench \u2026 Per Mertesacker for one\".</p> <p>For the first time since replacing J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann in 2006 L\u00f6w finds himself under pressure and facing searching questions, many of which relate to the semi-final defeat by Italy in Warsaw on 28 June. Never mind that L\u00f6w's record in charge of his country reads: Euro 2008 runners-up, World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012 semi-finalists. Germany always expect to win.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/11/germany-republic-of-ireland-world-cup\">More ...</a></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><br>Let us pray. </p> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> <br>Check out these teams. </p> <p><strong>Ireland:</strong> Westwood; Coleman, O'Shea, O'Dea, Ward; Cox, Fahey, McCarthy, Andrews, McGeady; Walters<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Forde, McShane, Long, Meyler, Kelly, Wilson, Clark, Keogh, Brady, Clifford, Randolph. </p> <p><strong>Germany:</strong> Neuer, Boateng, Mertesacker, Badstuber, Schmelzer, Khedira, Schweinsteiger, Ozil, Muller, Reus, Klose. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Zieler, Howedes, Westermann, Schurrle, Podolski, Kroos. </p> <p><strong>Referee: </strong>Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.38pm: Out trot the teams, with Manuel Neuer having an oddly pained expression on his face, as if coming all this way for a mere formality is one of the downside's of his job. What chance Ireland wipe that bored frown off his face? Oh. </p> <p>Still, on the line-ups suggest that one minor miracle has already occurred and Giovanni Trapattoni has changed his approach. Sort of. The orthodox three-man central midfield represent a a small but hopefully significant departure from his norm. So bearing that in mind, perhaps further history will be made tonight ... and Germany will suffer defeat in an away World Cup qualifier for the first time ever. Or Ireland will suffer their worst home defeat (which currently stands at 5-0, as inflicted by Spain in 5-0. Now, before you complain about that filler, know that it is better than the prematch guff going on in the stadium (but just as I say that: the band belts into Deutschland Uber Alles .... on the bagpipes!)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.47pm: Other scores from this group tonight: Faroe Island took the lead against Sweden before losing 2-1; and Kazakhstan held Austria to a 0-0.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Ireland kick off and after nine seconds Jon Walters - brought into the team to rough up the Germans - takes a mighty whack off Schmelzer. Freekick to Ireland wide on the right. McGeady sends it into the area, and that man Schmelzer intervenes again, this time conceding a corner. Decent start by Ireland ...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Ridiculous decision by the referee, who fails to notice that Ward's cross from the left only went wide because of a huge deflection off Boateng. It's like the Thierry Henry handball all over again, or something.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Confident stuff so far by Ireland, who are winning everything in midfied ... and might even have created a shooting opportunity if Walters had been able to pick out McGeady just now rather than Badstuber. \"Mate, the German commentators on ZDF are mad for the Dudelsack (bagpipes) anthem,\" chirps Rob Jacques. \"Get a fiver on for it to be Xmas number one in Germany.\" And I am mad for \"Dudelsack\" as a translation for bagpipes. I hereby vow to use it liberally.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Germany threaten for the first time, with Muller cutting in off the left and crossing ... and Ward darn near turns it into his own net, woefully shanking an attempted clearance. To everyone's relief, the ball flies just wide.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Walters gets a face full of Mertersacker elbow. Fahey sends the freekick in from deep, and Ward is close to getting on the end of it, only for Khedira to usher the danger away. But so far, so good from Ireland, in the main.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> There's pleasing zip and purpose about Ireland so far, and they've got the upperhand; the three central midfielder ploy is working; McGeady is looking sprightly; Waltersw is a warrior; and O'Dea has begun well. All in all, the Dudelsack version of Deutschland Uber Alles appears to have done the trick so far ...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> The Germans are beginning to find their groove. Lots of pinging it about in the Irish half. Ireland are scurrying after them gamely but after several minutes of possession, Germany create a clear chance, Reus whipping a good cross into the box. Muller met it about 8 yards from goal but bopped the ball badly over.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> German domination is growing, but Irish scampering is not weakening. But the home team are dropping deeper and deeper.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> The increasingly influential Muller drifts in from the left and clips a cross into the danger zone ... Klose has ghosted between O'Dea and O'Shea but fortunately the cross is fractionally behind him and rather than head at goal from six yards, he has to nod it backwards to Reus, who bungles his effort.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Irish fans are booing in an attempt to put the Germans off their ominous possession play. That won't work lads: you need to get the Dudelsacks out again.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Ireland finally regain possession and McCarthy tries to instigate an instant attack, sending a raking long ball over the top for Walters to chase. Neuer, however, shows superb sweeping skills to sprint way out of his box and head it clear before the striker can connect.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Germany continue to knock it about but Ireland are keeping their shape and defending stoutly and Walters is proving a decent fulcrum on the few occasions that they get a chance to move forward. There is hope.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Not for the first time, Cox kills a promising Irish move with a sloppy pass. He's not been on his game so far.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> There's a whiff of complacency about Germany. They're dominating possession but playing at a pace that is comfortable for Ireland and not committing many players to attack, as if convinced that they're front-men should make the breakthrough with much back-up from midfield.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Phew! O'Shea dawdles on the ball in his own box and Reus robs him ... then O'Shea hauls him down .... and the ref books him for diving! A terrible yet beautiful decision! And all that moments after Coleman nutmegged Schweinsteiger. This might just be another one of those brilliantly crazy nights in Dublin ...</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ireland 0-1 Germany (Reus 32')</strong> Or maybe not. That was plain old bad craziness. Slack defending by Ireland, in particular McGeady, allowed Schmelzer to hurtled into the box and chest a pass down. As a couple of Irish players fell over, Reus arrived to exact retribution for the diving fiasco of a moment ago and tonk the ball into the net off the underside of the crossbar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> This is agonizing defending from Ireland. With Germany now playing with a fearsome swagger, Ireland are starting to look very dozy at the back and even the moment elementary clearances are becoming difficult and shape is falling apart. Germany look intent on adding to the damage before the break and Ireland's capacity to resist is in serious doubt ...</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Ireland can't keep track of the German movement. Muller, again contriving to receive the ball in loads of space, swivels 25 yards from goal and then decides to have a ging. Over the bar it went.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ireland 0-2 Germany (Reus 39')</strong> That's a wonderful break and finish. Ireland were trying to cobble together an attack when Schmelzer broke it up and launched an attack from deep. Boateng and Ozil, performer of a superb turn, played key parts before Reus collected the ball wide on the left and fired an excellent shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Nice play by Walters and McCarthy to relieve a modicum of pressure. But it'll be back on in a minute, you can be sure of that ...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> \"Call me crazy but I have a feeling Ireland is not going to win this match,\" reckons JR in Illinois. \"I suppose it's time to start hoping that they don't lose by more than San Marino does to England.\" You think San Marino will lose to Enngland? Apparently that is in real doubt at the moment ....</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Well, Ireland started OK. But German superiority soon came to the fore and now a severe drubbing is on the cards. Trap could throw on Shane Long and go all guns blazing but the German armoury is manifestly better and they could blow the hosts away by even more. 5-0 was 50-1 before this match, I happen to know ...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Germany change: Khedira off; Kroos on. No changes by Ireland ....</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Yellow card for O'Dea for tackle from behind on Muller. That's the closest an Irish player has been to him for quite a while. \"Dortmund's youth coach thought Reus wouldn't make it so he had to leave the club,\" recalls Oscar Morris. \"Expensive mistake. They bought him back this year for 17 million.\" Madness. They could have had about 57 Keith Faheys for that.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Ozil swings in a corner, which Klose meets but heads wide from nine yards. \"The scary thing about this game is that the only panacea to how Ireland are playing begins when the players are five and six,\" pontificates David Fallon. \"Quite literally, passing the ball, is a step to far for each of them. If they manage more than 5 uninterrupted passes in this half I'll eat my leprechaun lederhosen.\" But not your Dudelsack?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Ireland showing some gumption, and an attack conclude with Ward slipping a nice ball through to Cox, whose attempt from an acute angle almost catches out Neuer, who was anticipating a cross. The keeper grabs it at the second attempt. \"On RTE Eamonn Dunphy has said 'I've played on bad teams, relegation teams, teams that were going nowhere, and Ireland have that look about them',\" reveals Paul McNulty.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Ireland are going for it: Shane Long has been introduced for Fahey, which presumably means a switch to 4-4-2. The crowd roar their approval.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Ireland have begun this half as well as they started the first. McGeady curls a freekick in from the right, and Neuer is obliged to make a save, because of a miscued attempted clearance by a defender, I think.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Definite penalty. O'Dea takes down Klose, who beat him to the ball to collect a Muller pass.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ireland 0-3 Germany (Ozil 55')</strong> Ozil does a Balotelli, and Westwood buys it.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> On the plus side, at least Ireland aren't softening Germany up ahead of Sweden's trip there on Tuesday .....</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ireland 0-4 (Klose 58')</strong> Oh for crying out loud. Schweingsteiger opens up the Irish defence with one pass from deep, Klose beats Westwood to it and then sends a low shot towards goal from a tight angle .... and O'Dea escorts it into the net.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Another simple pass dissects the Irish defence, but Coleman gets back to make a heroic tackle to stop Reus helping himself to a hat-trick. At t his point I should remind you that Ireland's record home defeat is 5-0, as inflicted by Spain in 1931.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ireland 0-5 Germany (62')</strong> Ozil clips a ball into the box, O'Shea heads it weakly to the edge of the area, where Kroos arrives to hammer it into the net. Half an hour for Ireland to salvage some dignity. I'm not confident.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> There's a touch of supermarket sweep to the German approach now, with all their forward players fancying their chances of helping themselves to whatever they fancy. Individual greed could well be Ireland's best chance of of avoiding a record annihilation.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> German substitution: Lukas Podolski is actually <em>Laughing</em> as he bounces on to the pitch. Off lollops Reus.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Ozil slides a lovely ball through to the overlapping Boateng, who cracks a cross towards the six-yard box. O'Dea manages to divert it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Ireland substitution: McGeady off, Keogh on. Is that why Podoloski was laughing?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Given that Trapattoni has based his whole approach on Ireland supposedly being difficult to break down, this is a monumental failure at a time when he desperately needed to give his few remaining believers extra food for faith. This could be the end of the line for the manager.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> German change: Klose off, Schurrle on. Only 18 minutes for Ireland to cling on. Before Trap is let go. Surely. \"Alone now in a darkened room upstairs,\" confides Justin Kavanagh. \"The commentator shouts 'it's five' from the TV downstairs. Can't watch any more. Open the bottle of Scotch. Thankfully for Ireland's Italian coach famed worldwide for his catenaccio. Bring back John Giles. Jesus, bring back Eamon Dunphy at this stage. At least he wins the odd argument.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Andrews tries to give Neuer something to do. PLenty of power in his 25-yard shot, but no precision. Way wide it goes, as fans file out of the ground ...</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Ireland are now offering nothing. Only creeping dilettantism in the German play is preventing the margin of destruction being greater.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Shane Long booked for a late tackle. Now no one can say he has made no impact since coming on.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Save! An actual save! Westwood gets down to block a Boateng shot from the edge of the area after prolonged German possession.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Germany have been excellent and are one of the best teams in the world, but it must be remembered that they are only doing what many teams have threatened to do against Ireland over the last year or two, and many have come close. The Trap era is surely over. This match, unfortunately, is not yet. Six, at least, remains a distinct probability.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ireland 0-6 Germany (Kroos 82')</strong> Can I swear now please? After lengthy German manoeuvring, Kroos receives the ball in splendid isolation at the edge of the area and whacks a low drive into the net. History is made: Ireland worst ever home defeat. </p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Badstuber booked, for an offence I didn't see because I was sprucing up my huge TRAP OUT placard. Meanwhile, this mail from Owen Mulligan arrived a little late: \"I just hope we lose in moderation but in the words of Flann O'Brien: Moderation, we find, is an extremely difficult thing to get in this country\".\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Just two more minutes till the Dudelsacked headlines, hopefully.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> After much toying by Germany in the box, and a possible penalty for the visitors, Kroos is denied a hat-trick by a decent Westwood save.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ireland 1-6 Ireland (Keogh 90+2')</strong> After Neuer turns a Keogh shot behind for a corner, the Millwall man is left unmarked to receive the set-piece and send it a fine header into the net from six yards.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Ireland's record home defeat was predictable and a fair reflection of the match. Germany were very good, Ireland were without some important players but this was still inexcusable and, to repeat, given the approach that Trappatoni prioritises, there is no justification for him continuing as Ireland manager.

  "<p>Half a century ago, in October 1962, the world woke up to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis\" title=\"\">Cuban missile crisis</a>. The Russians were unloading nuclear missiles on Cuba, and the Americans were demanding they be withdrawn. For some people, perhaps for many, it seemed the moment to drag out the old evangelical poster: The End of the World is Nigh. One prominent anti-nuclear campaigner fled noisily to the west coast of Ireland, imagining mistakenly that there she might be safe. It was a frightening time. Even today I can remember the chill in the air, something not just the result of autumnal bad weather.</p> <p>I spent most evenings that week demonstrating outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square. It was a small demonstration and, as I recall, no one bothered much to protest outside the Russian embassy. We thought that the Americans were going to invade Cuba, a repeat of their efforts the previous year at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion\" title=\"\">Bay of Pigs</a>. We knew that they had plans to sabotage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/29/castro-cuba-revolution-1959\" title=\"\">Fidel Castro's revolution</a>.</p> <p>Years later, having read almost everything available about the crisis, I suspect that it was not quite as serious as it seemed at the time. The cold warriors liked to play it up, and so too did Bertrand Russell and other spokesmen for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Yet it is clear from the record that those in charge behaved in an exemplary manner. President Kennedy in particular outfaced those of his advisers \u2013 like the long-lived General Curtis LeMay \u2013 who wanted immediate military action. The president never allowed the affair to escape from his capable hands.</p> <p>The British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was worried about the inexperienced young president, and the two men spoke on the phone every evening (in the middle of the night for Macmillan). The prime minister probably imagined that he was introducing a note of calm into the fevered atmosphere of the White House. Yet Kennedy was well up to the job, and clearly found the evening conversations a dull but necessary chore. The British were just happy to be on side.</p> <p>The Cubans suffered the most. They were happy to host the Soviet missiles, but were alarmed by Khrushchev's insistence that they should be installed secretly. Indeed, they argued consistently with the Soviets that these new defence arrangements should be made public from the start.</p> <p>Khrushchev thought differently. He wanted to surprise the Americans. He thought that once the missiles were installed the Americans would be confronted with a fait accompli. He imagined that he was saving Cuba from attack, which was, after all, the logic of the nuclear deterrent. He also despatched a vast conventional arsenal, creating the largest foreign military base ever seen in the history of the Caribbean.</p> <p>Inevitably Khrushchev's deception was eventually uncovered. On 14 October a US spy plane detected a missile-launching site west of Havana, and a week of serious secret discussions began in the White House, followed by a <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/cuban-missile-crisis\" title=\"\">television announcement by the US president on the night of 22 October </a>that launched the public phase of the week-long crisis.</p> <p>The presence of the missiles put the Cubans in great danger, and when the missiles were eventually withdrawn they remained hurt and angry. They had lost the power to control their own destiny: Castro never quite trusted Khrushchev again. He refused to allow international inspection of the process of missile withdrawal.</p> <p>Yet the Cubans certainly won a small victory, securing a tacit assurance from the Americans that the Bay of Pigs would not be repeated \u2013 an assurance that has lasted for 50 years. It has even survived the collapse of the Soviet Union itself. Indeed, of all the participants in the crisis, Cuba has changed the least.</p> <p>Most of the world thought that Khrushchev had gambled and lost. The Chinese in particular thought he had behaved in an irresponsible fashion, and stepped up the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split\" title=\"\">Sino-Soviet dispute</a>. The Soviet politburo had a similar view, and two years later they quietly removed Khrushchev from power.</p> <p>The Cubans remained distrustful of the Soviets (and of their allies within the Communist party of Cuba), and they did not finally sign up as a loyal member of the Soviet camp until the end of the 60s.</p> <p>The impact and significance of the missile crisis will be argued about for another half-century and beyond. It is taught in schools and discussed in university seminars. Yet although dramatic \u2013 and traumatic for some \u2013 it may not have been as important as other seminal events of that decade \u2013 the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/22/newsid_2451000/2451143.stm\" title=\"\">assassination of President Kennedy</a> a year later, and the stepping up of the attacks on North Vietnam the year after that.</p> <p>The crisis was certainly an important milestone, and it may have made the great powers more careful. It may also have speeded up the signing of the <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nuclear-test-ban-treaty-signed\" title=\"\">test-ban treaty of 1963</a>, a worthwhile legacy in itself. It also allowed the Cuban revolution to survive. It may have been a foolish and dangerous strategy on Khrushchev's part, but it worked.</p>",

Fourteen patients are known to have died as a result of the rare form of fungal meningitis.</p> <p>The New England Compounding Centre (NECC) \u2013 to which the cause of the outbreak has been traced \u2013 has been cited in court papers over its role in the growing health scare. In legal documents filed in Minnesota on Thursday, a woman named as Barbe Puro launched a class action on behalf of patients who had been administered the contaminated steroid shots.</p> <p>The lawsuit seeks redress from the compounding pharmacy over the sale of \"defective and dangerously contaminated steroids, which has caused plaintiff and others bodily harm, emotional distress, other personal injuries, and to incur medical and other expenses\".</p> <p>It is the first such action lodged in the courts since cases of the rare form of fungal meningitis began to be linked to NECC last week. The outbreak is believed to have originated from batches of contaminated methylprednisolone acetate \u2013 a steroid used to ease back pain \u2013 that were prepared by NECC and shipped to 76 clinics in 23 states between July and September.</p> <p>Visiting the pharmacy last week, investigators from the Food and Drug Administration found a fungal contaminate in a sealed vial and a \"foreign material\" in another, opened container. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/two-deaths-us-meningitis-outbreak?intcmp=239\">It has since emerged that the pharmacy compounder has a checkered history, and has been cited in the past for health and safety violations</a>.</p> <p>Despite this, clinics from across the US were able to order close to 18,000 doses of the steroid. This has prompted a large-scale search for all those who were injected.</p> <p>In an update Friday, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added 14 new cases to its tally of those infected. Clinics in 12 states are now known to have administered the drug to patients, health officials said.</p>",

  "<p>The reproductive rights segment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/joe-biden-paul-ryan-debate-politics-live\">Thursday night's vice-presidential debate</a> waddled through our nation's consciousness awkwardly, bumping furniture and barking shins on its way back into the dark margins of the presidential campaign.</p> <p>While the Obama campaign has been eager to highlight instances of the GOP's \"war on women\", only the most earnest partisans ever seek direct engagement with abortion policy in a public forum: the issue is too intimate, too divisive, and opinions too contingent on personal circumstance to make it worth lengthy discussion. Politicians on both sides of the issue speak in code \u2013 \"reproductive rights\" and \"pro-life\" \u2013 rather than risk entanglement in specifics. </p> <p>Word shot around Twitter quickly last night that Paul Ryan's poorest marks from CNN's debate focus group came when Martha Raddatz asked both candidates to tell her, explicitly, \"what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion.\"</p> <p>To be fair to Ryan, I suspect at least part of the fall in support came from the introduction to the topic. Say \"abortion\" and hands twitch in search of the \"volume down\" knob. To be fair to the audience members, it's not like Ryan said anything all that worth paying attention to.</p> <p>Critics have rightly panned Raddatz's framing of the question: the idea that <em>because</em> \"this is such an emotion issue for so many people in the country,\" one should then \"talk personally about\" it is exactly wrong, for instance. It's an emotional issue, so maybe politicians should leave their own personal feelings out of it \u2013 let the people (that is, women) making the decision explore their consciences. Congressman Ryan's \"personal\" views on abortion are important to me only insofar as he thinks they are more relevant, or somehow not as personal, as mine. And \u2013 oh, right \u2013 he does think that. </p> <p>After all, Ryan told Raddatz, his Catholic faith is a \"factor\" in his pro-life position, \"but it's also because of reason and science.\"</p> <p>Ryan's views on abortion have about as much to do with \"science and reason\" as the squiggly audience approval lines underneath the debate participants have to do with facts and logic. Most Americans would avoid discussing abortion because it makes them uncomfortable, while most politicians should want to skip the topic because spending too much time on it, as Paul Ryan does, reveals the unfortunate, real-world consequences of a policy made from the perspective of a man whose formative interaction with a fetus was via an ultrasound of the wanted child he and his healthy, upper-middle class, insured wife were going to have.</p> <p>Of course, you don't <em>have</em> to have had a personal experience with an unwanted pregnancy to be less righteous about women being forced to carry them to term. You just need the ability to imagine that there are other legitimate ways of thinking about abortion beyond your own. It's a lack of this kind of imagination that I think of when we talk about anti-choice politicians, especially men, being misogynists.</p> <p>To be sure, there's hardly a more embedded form of bigotry than denying a woman control of her body, but I don't believe that politicians such as Paul Ryan go home at night and cackle over the impending disenfranchisement of women \u2013 though I believe that is where the kind of legislation Ryan has backed will take us.</p> <p>No, Ryan's misogyny is more subtle: he doesn't actively believe women are less smart and capable than men; he just has a hard time understanding why they would think <em>any differently</em> than men.</p>",
  "<p>The government has been dragged into the Jimmy Savile scandal after it emerged that the Department of Health could be sued directly over claims the star abused patients when he was a volunteer at Broadmoor hospital in the 1970s and 1980s.</p> <p>A lawyer acting for victims preparing legal action against Stoke Mandeville hospital and the BBC said it was possible the government could face civil claims as it was directly responsible for the running of the Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital in that time.</p> <p>Savile was a volunteer for more than four decades at the hospital, had keys to its secure unit and at one point in 1988 was appointed to lead a \"taskforce\" overseeing the management of the hospital after its management board was dismissed by the then health secretary, Kenneth Clarke.</p> <p>The Department of Health confirmed that it had launched an internal inquiry into its management of the secure hospital before it was transferred to the control of West London mental health trust in 2001. A number of allegations of abuse at the hospital have emerged, including one claim by a psychiatric nurse that a former patient told her Savile had repeatedly raped her at Broadmoor.</p> <p>The scale of the crisis at the BBC became apparent on Friday night with the director general, George Entwistle, calling a last-minute press conference to announce two independent inquiries into the Savile scandal and the BBC's reporting of it. He offered a \"profound and heartfelt apology\" to Savile's victims.</p> <p>The actor Julie Fernandez, who has appeared in The Office and Eldorado, said on Friday the presenter groped her when she appeared on Jim'll Fix It aged 14. She said she was sitting next to him in her wheelchair and his hands \"lingered in places they shouldn't\".</p> <p>She told Radio 5 live that: \"It was in a busy room full of people in a studio so it was quite discreetly done \u2026 I do remember feeling uncomfortable.\" She said she joked about it later with classmates but never told an adult about it.</p> <p>Metropolitan police revealed that their investigations were spiralling and now involved 340 lines of inquiry and 40 potential victims.</p> <p>Liz Dux, a partner at Russell Jones &amp; Walker in London and an expert in personal injury and child abuse cases, revealed on Friday that she was acting for a number of women who want to sue the BBC and Stoke Mandeville hospital on the grounds of vicarious liability. With 340 lines of inquiry, the threat of legal action is expected to spread to other institutions where Savile made official charity visits.</p> <p>Dux said it could also reach the government: \"The government is not immune in civil litigation. It would absolutely be no different to sue the government.\"</p> <p>Health ministers and civil servants are hastily trying to establish the management structures at the hospital between 1959, when the one-time Victorian prison became part of the NHS under the Mental Health Act of that year, and 2001, when the government no longer had direct responsibility for its running.</p> <p>\"Although the framework for child protection and safeguarding for Broadmoor and other special hospital patients changed radically in 1999, we of course want to establish the circumstances and see if any lessons can be learned,\" a Department of Health spokesman said. In hindsight it was clearly not appropriate that Savile had been given a supervisory role at the hospital, said the spokesman, adding \"it is far from clear why any such role would have required possession of \u2026 a set of keys, we need to establish how he came to have them and on what basis\".</p> <p>Clarke was appointed health secretary on 25 July 1988. The management board was dismissed the following month. He said: \"I have no recollection of ever having met Jimmy Savile and no recollection of these events. The Department of Health are now investigating to establish the facts.\"</p> <p>Dux, a personal injury lawyer who has acted for people with severe spinal injuries and amputees, has been contacted by several women who want to sue over the Savile allegations. She said she is preparing cases against the BBC and the hospital on the grounds that they both have a duty of care to anyone who comes into contact with their staff or agents.</p> <p>\"The case would be against the BBC or the hospital because they would be held vicariously liable in law on behalf of someone like Savile who was acting as their agent,\" Dux told BBC Radio 4's World at One on Friday.</p> <p>\"So in the case of the BBC where he abused people through his connection with programmes, for example the case about the girl who alleges she was abused in his changing room, then because of the close connection with the BBC, the BBC would be what we call vicariously liable in those circumstances,\" she added.</p> <p>\"Likewise in the hospitals. He may not have been paid by the hospital but he's there as their agent, then they owe a duty of care to those he abused.\"</p> <p>Dux said the duty of care towards patients or guests of Top of the Pops, Jim'll Fix It and other programmes would be \"heightened\" if any managers had suspicions at the time about Savile.</p> <p>The threat of legal action will now increase the pressure on the BBC and the police to establish who knew what, when and why rumours of his interest in young women were not acted upon.</p> <p>The fact that some alleged incidents happened decades ago was not an issue, she said. \"By their nature, abuse cases are often historic. They are often very old by the time cases are brought. People feel great shame and psychologically don't feel able to talk about it for some time,\" she told World at One. \"Quite often the courts will apply their discretion to allow these cases. For example, sex abuse cases against the Catholic church or against schools or the children's homes cases in Jersey.\"</p> <p>\"They want some form of recognition as to what's happened to them in the past. They want to be taken seriously, they are not interested in the financial compensation at all, they just want the cathartic process of telling someone what they have been through and someone believing them for a change.\"She said compensation could range from a few thousand pounds for someone who suffered a minor assault and got on with their lives to hundreds of thousands if their lives had been wrecked, for instance if they had been unable to have a career or form relationships.</p> <p>\"To win the case against the BBC you do not have to show they knew about it, provided you can prove Savile was acting as an agent of the BBC,\" said Dux.</p> <p>Richard Scorer, a Manchester lawyer acting for the Rochdale child abuse victims and co-author of Child Abuse Compensation Claims, said victims could also sue Savile's estate \"even if the assets have been distributed to others\".</p> <p>He said there would be difficulty in getting a case to court because Savile was dead, but the \"evidence stacking up\" meant courts were likely to be sympathetic to a trial.</p> <p>Scorer won \u00a3580,000 for a man who had suffered abuse as a child, one of the highest payouts in an English court. He suffered a mental breakdown at the age of 45 when the police started investigating case, and the payout reflected his inability to work after that. Most payouts are less than \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>\"The difficulty normally is the injury is inflicted when you are a child so you don't have an earnings capacity built up; this man did,\" said Scorer.</p>",
  "<p>Yekaterina Samutsevich, the Pussy Riot member freed by a Moscow court this week, has promised to continue taking part in the band's anti-Putin protests, saying she would be \"more careful and more clever\" to avoid another arrest.</p> <p>On Friday, in her first newspaper interview, Samutsevich said her parting words to the two band members who remain in jail were that she would continue their struggle against the president. But she expects state pressure on her to grow despite her new-found freedom</p> <p>\"They didn't overturn the verdict, they didn't say I'm not guilty \u2013 they gave me a suspended sentence. If I do the slightest thing [wrong], even an administrative violation, they can send me back to jail,\" she told the Guardian.</p> <p>The three women were sentenced to two years in a prison colony on charges of \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\" following their anti-Putin \"punk prayer\" in a Moscow cathedral. Samutsevich was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/10/pussy-riot-member-freed-moscow\" title=\"\">unexpectedly freed by an appeals court on Wednesday</a> after successfully arguing that she didn't fully take part in the performance.</p> <p>\"I didn't expect it,\" Samutsevich said, sitting in a central Moscow cafe wearing the same jeans and white sweater she wore to the appeal hearing. At her feet lay a canvas sack and large plastic bag filled with clothes, letters and books. She had just collected her belongings from the southern Moscow detention centre that still holds her bandmates, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova.</p> <p>Samutsevich described how the three friends had prepared themselves for prison during the appeal hearing. \"In court, we were talking about how we would go to the prison colony, what it would be like. When they took us back into the courtroom, we said: that was a very short deliberation, they probably won't change the verdict.\" (A panel of three judges deliberated for just 40 minutes before announcing Samutsevich's release.)</p> <p>She struggled to explain the judges' thinking. \"Maybe the authorities wanted to imitate the independence of the court system,\" she said. \"But it is just that \u2013 an imitation.\"The case against Pussy Riot was one of most high-profile political trials in Russia since Putin first came to power 12 years ago. The president has condemned their performance and their name, while Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister, said he was \"nauseated\" by the group's action.</p> <p>Samutsevich said Putin stood behind the decision to prosecute the band. \"Such decisions don't happen without the president,\" she said. \"It was either motivated by personal hate or it was a political step.\" The appeal judges held a rare press conference on Thursday to press that they made the decision independently and with no pressure from above.</p> <p>\"They're trying to marginalise us, to say we're not normal people,\" she said. \"We were jailed for our political beliefs.\"</p> <p>Pussy Riot formed after Putin announced late last year that he planned to return to the presidency \u2013 a move that prompted mounting discontent to spill into the streets with a growing protest movement which vowed to prevent a return to totalitarianism.</p> <p>The arrest of the three band members in early March was seen as a signal to other protesters. The Duma, Russia's parliament, has since adopted a series of restrictive laws imposing fines on illegal protests and broadening a law on treason. \"Putin is a person who doesn't want to listen to the citizens of Russia,\" Samutsevich said. \"People complain and he ignores it all. Instead his government adopts awful laws \u2013 that's his answer to citizens' attempts to talk to him,\" she said.</p> <p>Samutsevich said she would continue taking part in Pussy Riot's anonymous performances. She does not worry that she is now recognised, often by people on the street.</p> <p>\"When a person is in a mask and a dress, she can become anonymous again,\" she said. As for the fear of getting caught, she said: \"I will be more careful and more clever.\"</p> <p>She thought Russia's security services would step up their surveillance. \"I must live imagining that everything is listened to, everything is read.\"</p> <p>Samutsevich said Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were happy with her release. As they hugged goodbye inside the courtroom's glass cage, her fellow band members said: \"Finally, one of us is free.\" Samutsevich recalled: \"They said: keep going with the group and I said: of course.\"</p> <p>Alyokhina, 24, and Tolokonnikova, 22, both mothers to young children, are expected to be sent to distant prison colonies to serve the rest of their sentence until March 2014.</p> <p>\"Masha [Alyokhina] especially is suffering for her child,\" Samutsevich said. \"It's a big blow for her\u2013 for Nadya too. They have hardly seen their kids.\"</p> <p>Samutsevich described her seven months in pre-trial detention as a time of cold isolation in which the system exercised \"total control\". Wake-up came at 6am and lights out at 9pm. In between, there were three meals a day \u2013 porridge for breakfast, soup or a potato for lunch, and porridge or soup for dinner.</p> <p>Once a week, she was allowed 30 minutes of privacy for a shower. Otherwise, she was led everywhere by a guard.</p> <p>She shared her cell with three women, all charged with economic crimes. They were subjected to random searches, as guards hunted for banned items such as mobile phones. \"That's what they said, but they always read my letters.\" Samutsevich said she would get around a dozen letters a day from supporters.</p> <p>Sometimes she read classics from the prison library, turning especially to Nikolai Chernyshevsky, the philosopher who wrote Russia's classic revolutionary novel, What is to be Done? Other times, she watched television in her cell.</p> <p>At first, her cellmates treated her with suspicion. \"They didn't understand who I was or what we did,\" she said. That changed as reports on the Pussy Riot case started to run on television. \"Then they started to support me, and by the end they really took care of me,\" she said.</p> <p>Samutsevich said she was sorry to leave Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova \u2013 but added that even in jail they were unable to spend time together: each one was held on a separate floor. \"I miss them. But I missed them [in prison] too \u2013 we could never talk.</p> <p>\"We could only talk when we were driven to court and back during the trial,\" she said. \"Those were the best times in the whole seven months. We had time to talk about different subjects \u2013 films, books, articles, and, of course the case, our thoughts about the day.\"</p> <p>The three women were deprived of information from the outside world, but kept informed of events by their lawyers.</p> <p>\"One day in court, the lawyers showed us photos. We didn't understand what it was. Then they explained it was Madonna, with writing on her back supporting us,\" she said.</p> <p>That was when she understood the whole world was watching. Madonna was one of a handful of artists who performed in Moscow, and who came out in support of the jailed band.</p> <p>\"All this solidarity meant we were understood in modern cultural society,\" Samutsevich said. \"That was very important to us.\"</p> <p>She has spent her two days of freedom shuttling between Russia's few independent media outlets, hoping to keep the spotlight on her two jailed friends.</p> <p>Asked if she could repeat the church performance, she hesitated for just a moment. \"Yes, I would probably do it. It was important for us to do it, to express our opinion.</p> <p>\"I saw the system from the inside,\" she said of her time in prison. \"I saw how this punitive system doesn't work, how it doesn't acknowledge personal dignity.\"</p> <p>Asked about performing with some of the western artists who have come out in support of the band, she declined. \"Our group is made for unsanctioned concerts,\" Samutsevich said. \"The symbol of the group is still a girl in a balaclava.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is facing mounting pressure to spell out precisely what activities it regards as high-risk \"casino-style\" investment banking \u2013 which are to be ringfenced from traditional savings and loans to safeguard the banking system.</p> <p>Publishing a draft banking reform bill , Treasury minister Greg Clark said: \"We want to ensure that taxpayers are protected whilst retaining our status as a global financial centre. The government remains on course to have all ICB [Independent Commission on Banking,] legislation in place by the end of this parliament.\"</p> <p>But Andrew Tyrie, the MP leading the scrutiny of the government's banking reforms as chairman of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, is annoyed at the lack of clarity in the bill. He wanted to know which recommendations from the ICB \u2013 better known as the Vickers' commission after chairman Sir John Vickers \u2013 the government wants to jettison. In broad terms the proposals have been endorsed enthusiastically by the chancellor, George Osborne, who is pressing to get the bill formally before parliament early next year. There are similar moves to erect a EU-wide regulatory ringfence in banking were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/02/bankers-bonuses-bonds-eu-report\" title=\"\">unveiled this month by European commissioner Michel Barnier</a>.</p> <p>But Tyrie raised concerns over a lack of detail in the draft bill and wants clarity on whether or not controversial interest rate swaps \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/29/banks-fsa-review-compensation-payouts?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">derivatives found to be at the centre of widespread mis-selling scandals</a> \u2013 will sit within the ringfence.</p> <p>The Treasury is understood to have written to Tyrie seeking his views on which side of the ring-fence interest rate swaps sold to small business should sit.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Tyrie said: \"The draft bill appears to leave a lot of detail to be determined in secondary legislation. We will press vigorously to find out what that is going to contain. Only by doing so will anyone \u2013 the industry, bank customers, parliament and the public \u2013 be able to find out what this legislation really means for them.\" Despite the importance of this legislation, MPs have less time to scrutinise the proposed laws than is typical as all sides recognise the need to get the bill into law as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Tyrie will next week issue a call for written evidence from banking experts in response to Friday's draft bill to be submitted as soon as possible. His commission must deliver its scrutiny report on the banking reform bill by 18 December, and will then produce a second, wider report on standards in banking which is expected to be published in the new year.</p> <p>The commission will host veteran American regulator Paul Volcker next Wednesday and is expected to question him on the scepticism he has already voiced over ring-fencing. The former chairman of the Federal Reserve is often cited as the intellectual forebear of Vickers. He is credited with coining the so-called \"Volcker rule\", which seeks to prevent commercial banks from owning hedge fund-type operations and using their own money to take high risk bets on the markets.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9561349/Gentle-giant-Paul-Volcker-has-too-little-time-left-to-fix-the-world.html\" title=\"\">Volcker told one newspaper</a>: \"In my experience ring-fencing is not terribly effective ... It only works in fair weather, but doesn't work in foul weather. They have already run into problems and they are bound to run into more.</p> <p>\"John [Vickers] and I have the same concerns in mind. But the logic would be to separate the two parts of banking, not to keep them within the same institution. I find it puzzling to suggest that within one organisation you can have a branch that is entirely independent of another subsidiary, with the confidence that never the twain shall meet?\"</p>",
  "<p>The Labour MP Ian Lavery will not set foot in Newcastle United's ground if Wonga's sponsorship of the team goes ahead, while the (Labour) leader of the council, Nick Forbes, said that the loans company shouldn't be allowed to make such a deal unless it ploughed some of its money into the city's debt advice services. \"Don't go to Wonga\" would be a central plank of that advice \u2013 they could just cut out the middleman and put \"Wonga \u2013 Don't Call Us\" on the strip. I'm sure we'd all appreciate the irony, and the people who really needed a loan would call them anyway.</p> <p>Their perceived misdeed is in the interest rate, which is astronomical \u2013 4,214% APR \u2013 and the sense that they target people whom mainstream finance wouldn't lend to, because they'd struggle to pay it back. And their answer: those people still need finance, especially since they're excluded from \"respectable\" finance, and it's often cheaper to go to Wonga than it is to have an unarranged overdraft with a high street bank.</p> <p>One argument they haven't made \u2013 because they couldn't \u2013 is that the city of Newcastle might not notice who the sponsor was. It is really marked how many people wear the strip even on non-match days; I've never seen such a high density of people walking round advertising the same defunct building society.</p> <p>\"I don't know why they couldn't just stick with Virgin Money,\" said Zufar Rehman, a club supporter and taxi driver. \"I wouldn't be wearing a shirt with Wonga on it, that's for sure.\" This is a bit of a refrain. \"I just think it should be left as Virgin Money,\" said John, standing outside Newcastle Labour Club. \"It'll change, there'll be a new strip, all the kids will want them, it's all money, money, money.\"</p> <p>His friend, also called John, said mordantly: \"It's always the same, everybody has a go at the toon,\" but added controversially, \"There's nowt wrong with Wonga. What about when they had the blue star? Nobody went on about people being alcoholics.\" (Newcastle Brown Ale sponsored the team between 1995 and 2000).</p> <p>That's the problem: when you look at Wonga compared with Northern Rock, dispenser of 125% mortgages, who's to say which business model set out to be the most exploitative?</p> <p>Wonga advertise, but could you say they were any more aggressive than Virgin Money, who encourage greater borrowing on their credit cards remorselessly? An unarranged overdraft with a high street bank can be more expensive than a Wonga loan. It varies from bank to bank, but that's a moot point because you probably won't be able to check: in January a Which? report asked volunteers to figure out the APRs on unarranged loans from four bank statements \u2013 between them, they only got seven out of 48 right. One volunteer had a PhD in maths.</p> <p>Meanwhile, what are the other high street alternatives for emergency money?</p> <p>A MoneyShop on the corner of Northumberland Street has rates so opaque that it's almost comical (their website is no better: under the heading Payday Loan Rates Explained, it explains what an interest rate is, without telling you what rates it lends at). None of it looks like a brilliant deal \u2013 one Chinese guy with very poor English walks in with some jewellery and walks out with \u00a344; a girl rolls her existing loan into a bigger loan, for a trip to London. It's hard to feel very confident about these as financial decisions, but as the Cheque Shop opposite trumpets in the window, it's CHEAPER THAN A BANK (possibly).</p> <p>What's interesting about all this is not that people at the bottom of the market get fleeced, but rather that those same tactics \u2013 complexity and exorbitance \u2013 are deployed by the mainstream as well.</p> <p>However, sponsorship is a separate issue: Jean Boies, waiting at the bus station, said: \"These lenders are creeping up everywhere, and I don't think people understand the APR system. These footballers are their heroes, if they say Wonga's good, they'll just assume it's OK.\"</p> <p>I personally don't think it's as bad as Carol Vorderman advertising as the face of a fabulously expensive debt consolidation service in the mid-noughties. People reported feeling genuinely betrayed by how bad the deal was, having trusted the maths lady to have done the maths. Footballers, by contrast, are not known for their canny financial decisions. If anything, they're known for spending too much money on almost everything.</p> <p>Wonga, incidentally, already have their name on the Newcastle United training ground. So it's possible that, like so many of these big corporate decisions, by the time people started talking about it, it had already happened.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, I despair of the&#xa0;left. The Conservative conference this week prompted a couple of such moments. How easy it is for the Tories to press the left's buttons. How embarrassingly predictable and knee-jerk the reactions are. No wonder those little scamps can't resist the temptation.</p> <p>There has been much huffing and puffing over the so-called Tory obsession with \"gerroff my land\" attitudes to burglars. Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, wants to give householders more leeway in using \"disproportionate force\". This provides an easy way for the Conservatives to look like champions of the innocent victim, then sit back and let the left make itself look like the champion of the villain.</p> <p>At the same time, critics are fond of&#xa0;pointing out that the Conservative fixation is on a problem that is tiny. People are hardly ever convicted of using disproportionate force against burglars, and whenever they are, it becomes a giant media talking point and they get their sentences reduced on appeal.</p> <p>When I tackled and caught a burglar, I&#xa0;had to sit in court as the defendant made out that I'd been really rough with her, pulling her hair and making her hurt&#xa0;her hand against the railings we'd grappled over. Luckily, the police had photographed the skin-breaking bite mark she gave me, while the record of&#xa0;the HIV test I'd been advised to have at the hospital that evening was also available. A lot of time and money is wasted as criminals stand in witness boxes whining about the sore knee they&#xa0;got when an indignant householder pushed them down the stairs \u2013 for nothing!</p> <p>Then there's the argument that, thus licensed, the entire nation will be sleeping with guns, machetes or baseball bats by their sides, as they leave their front doors wide open, in the hope that some inadequate scrap of humanity will make their day. The journalist Patrick Strudwick, who was horrifically beaten by a burglar, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/09/grayling-burglars-disproportionate-farce\" title=\"\">makes the point</a> that had he fought back, he would have ended up either even more badly hurt, or having hurt someone else very badly. Both of those are certainly possibilities. But it's also possible that, confronted with a threatening enough challenge, the attackers might have simply scarpered. Who can say? It's all conjecture.</p> <p>How one reacts <em>in extremis</em> depends a great deal on the kind of person you are (and also on how good you are at on-the-ground risk assessment). I was brought up in a fairly fight-keen culture \u2013 to hit back if someone hit me. I was reluctant at first, but when I tried it, it worked. People just stopped hitting me. Result.</p> <p>I'm the sort of person who would clump a burglar with the nearest heavy&#xa0;object, if that seemed the best option \u2013 and consider it was all their fault \u2013 not mine. Appalling, no doubt, but there you go.</p> <p>I understand that pretending you're asleep is probably more sensible. A lot of&#xa0;people would opt for that, regardless of legislation. But it's a shame that the left betrays what are supposed to be its guiding principles at times like these, and appears to assume that the majority of householders are one handy golf club away from uncontrollable savagery. Ultimately, if a burglar comes into my home \u2013 well, I want the right to choose how I handle a situation that I&#xa0;didn't ask&#xa0;to be in, that's all.</p> <p>Oh, Lord, the right to choose. There's no more powerful and predictable way to invite the left to start looking like a bunch of intransigent extremists than to&#xa0;whistle up yet another round of \"debate\" about abortion. But the left doesn't lead the debate. In allowing the right to set terms, the left remains forever on the defensive. When Maria Miller, culture secretary, said before the Tory conference that she'd like to reduce the abortion limit from 24 weeks to 20 weeks, I&#xa0;thought: \"There they go&#xa0;again.\" When&#xa0;Jeremy Hunt, health secretary, pronounced that he'd like to see it at 12&#xa0;weeks, I thought he was out of his tiny mind.</p> <p>But here's a shocker. Britain is exceptional in Europe when it comes to abortion. Lots of countries offer abortion on request, unlike us, and Britain should too. But the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6235557.stm\" title=\"\">gestational time limits</a> are fascinating. Among EU countries, 16 out&#xa0;of 27 are with Hunt, on 12 weeks. In France, abortion on demand is available until week 12. In Germany, it's also the first trimester. In Italy, it's within the first 90 days. Ah, you say, that'll be the Catholic influence. Perhaps. But that doesn't entirely explain Sweden, at 18&#xa0;weeks, Denmark, at 12 weeks, and Greece, at 12 weeks.</p> <p>On this issue, at least, the Tories are in step with Europe, and the left in Britain is out on its own. Well, not completely. Closest to us is the Netherlands, which gives abortion on request up to 13&#xa0;weeks, and allows it up to 24 weeks if the mother is in distress. Only Cyprus allows abortion notably later than the UK, at 28 weeks, but always under very strict conditions.</p> <p>Now, I don't point out these facts because I have a hidden agenda as a pro-lifer. I'm as pro-choice as the next progressive type. I understand why some people find all abortion abhorrent \u2013 and I think those people are dangerously sentimental, impractical and proscriptive.</p> <p>I'm certain pro-lifers will never get their way in this country. But it does upset me that they succeed in having such a deadening influence over pro-choice debate. So much so that there is none. It's all about \"holding the line\" and fearing \"the thin end of the wedge\".</p> <p>As with the disproportionate-force issue in burglary, pro-choice supporters will argue that only a very small number of abortions are carried out after week 20 anyway (about 2%). Is it completely mad of me to wonder if perhaps these abortions could&#xa0;be done earlier, if the&#xa0;imperative was there to make a decision sooner? At nearly six months, a&#xa0;woman is pretty seriously pregnant. And we all know that the earlier a termination is carried out, the better. Might an earlier limit actually be of benefit to women? Isn't it even worth discussing? Apparently not.</p> <p>It's even more heretical to suggest that it might seem odd to ask medical staff to let one foetus die, and move heaven and earth to persuade another at&#xa0;the same stage of development to live. To suggest anything of the sort is to&#xa0;mark yourself out as either some sort of hideous traitor to the cause, or an attention-seeking iconoclast who is playing with fire.</p> <p>But why? We should control this debate, but we ban it. We thrust it instead into the hands of the right, a group that <em>does</em> include extremists who wish to terminate abortion completely.</p> <p>Pro-choice people are best placed to&#xa0;deal sensibly with the moral issues that abortion is always going to have to&#xa0;negotiate. It's precisely by digging in&#xa0;our heels that we start looking stubborn and intransigent, rather than sensitive and self-confident. I'm not sure I do want to see the limit changed. But I am sure that I'd like to have an honest, involved and sincere debate about it, before I decide, without being&#xa0;told that this is \"giving in\" to the right. We do that anyway \u2013 by refusing to think and defending, defending, defending, without question or discussion, instead.</p>",
  "<p>A set of wire cutters and a moonless night were all the Taliban needed to break into one of the most intimidating military bases in Afghanistan, the vast desert headquarters of UK troops and the US Marine corps.</p> <p>The attack last month caught the foreign coalition in Afghanistan by surprise, and underlined the Taliban's tenacity even in a part of the country that was a focus of fighting by US surge forces, and where the Taliban's hold has been severely weakened.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/16/nato-troops-killed-afghanistan-helmand\" title=\"\">Fifteen insurgents killed two US marines and destroyed six Harrier jets in the attack</a>; another two were so badly damaged they could only be used \"for spares\". A fuel depot went up in flames and soldiers assigned to non-combat jobs grabbed weapons to fight the Taliban at close quarters.</p> <p>\"I came over to Afghanistan just expecting to refuel planes,\" said Sergeant Jammie Hawkins from Tennessee, who instead found himself trading bullets with three Taliban fighters outside his offices.</p> <p>\"A bus passed by, coming down the road on its daily routine, and they opened fire on it, and that's when we knew they weren't marines.\" Undaunted by the sudden explosion of the war into the usually calm heart of Bastion, he picked up his weapon and helped kill two attackers and injure the third.</p> <p>Camp Bastion, roughly the size of Reading, had always seemed uncomfortable but safe. British forces set up camp in the middle of a desert so inhospitable and isolated that it seemed immune to attack. Perhaps because of this, the vast blast walls that stretch round the 37km perimeter give way in some remoter areas to a wire fence, a weakness exploited in the attack.</p> <p>\"There were no suicide bombers, there were no tunnels,\" said Major General Mark Gurganus, when asked what the insurgents used to penetrate the base. \"It's a tool about this big, and it cuts wire.\" He gestured with his hands to show the type of implement found in standard toolboxes. \"We did not have the fence alarmed.\"</p> <p>The general, who commands US and Nato forces in south-western Afghanistan, told journalists visiting Bastion that insurgents had taken advantage of rolling desert to approach the base unseen. \"If you use terrain very carefully, and they did \u2013 they came up in an area that was pretty much obscured from a lot of the towers, they were able to move up. They did this on a night when there was absolutely zero illumination.\"</p> <p>But the suicide squad did not have to sneak through miles of desert; an arid moonscape once host to a handful of nomadic herders has become a precarious home to thousands of people fleeing violence, unemployment or government drugs eradication programmes elsewhere in Helmand.</p> <p>Just a few kilometres from the Bastion fence there is now a transient population of desperately poor villages. Mud paths are scattered with the dried husks of opium poppies, and the occasional cluster of bullet casings from AK-47s used by insurgents. The Afghan police and army pass through occasionally, and there is no other authority forup to 20,000 people living there, most of them poppy farmers.</p> <p>\"There is no real government up here, so the land just belongs to the first person who comes,\" said Lieutenant Mark Mensik, whose platoon is charged with patrolling south of Camp Bastion.</p> <p>\"The Taliban come up pretty freely. When we are out there they try to stay around, harass us and then go back south. They will definitely infiltrate when we are not out there,\" he added; his troops expect to hit a homemade bomb around once a week.</p> <p>Recently, elder Attah Nazar, aged about 60 and who has 24 children, told a patrol of US troops less than 10km from Camp Bastion that the area was secure.</p> <p>\"I've lived here three years and never seen the Taliban in all that time,\" insisted his son-in-law Abdul Mohammad. Asked about a pile of nearby bullet casings \u2013 from ammunition not used by coalition forces \u2013 he shrugged. \"They must be from the Americans, there is no one else around.\"</p> <p>The imam from the village mosque, born in the same district as the Taliban's commander Mullah Omar, stood beside the remains of last year's opium crop and insisted the villagers only grow wheat.</p> <p>Most visits are equally frustrating, said Mensik, because although farmers resent Taliban efforts to tax them, they do not want to be targeted for helping, or appearing to help, foreign forces. \"All they are here to do is plant poppy, make money and get out of here.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pro-choice jitters over what a Romney administration would do to the reproductive rights of American women have intensified after Paul Ryan indicated in the debate that a Republican White House would overturn Roe v Wade and return control over abortion to individual states.</p> <p>Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate and Romney's running mate, was asked bluntly by the debate moderator, Martha Raddatz, whether pro-abortionists should to be worried by a Romney-Ryan ticket. Ryan replied: \"We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision \u2026 people, through their elected representatives and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process, should make this determination.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Ryan stated that a Romney administration would be opposed to abortion in all cases other than rape, incest and where the life of the mother was in danger.</p> <p>Reproductive rights groups said that Ryan's comments underlined the threat of a Republican victory next month. Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America said that the debate had reminded voters why elections matter.</p> <p>\"The Romney-Ryan ticket is extremely dangerous to women's health, and Americans should be very concerned about the future of women's health and rights if Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan win on November 6,\" she said.</p> <p>Lynn Paltrow, head of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, pointed out that Ryan was a co-sponsor \u2013 alongside the controversial Missouri politician Todd Akin \u2013 of the sanctity of life bill, that would give fetuses full legal rights from conception. \"If that act was ever passed it would immediately provide the basis for states to start arresting women who have abortions and charging them as murderers.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/romney-abortion-comments-ryan-differences\">The Romney campaign has been struggling this week</a> to give a clear message over its stance on abortion. Earlier this week, <a href=\"http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda\">in an interview with the Des Moines Register</a>, Romney appeared to be signaling that he would take a moderate position in office, saying that there was \"no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda\".</p> <p>Hours later, Romney aides reversed that statement with assurances to social conservatives that the Republican ticket was committed to rolling back abortion rights.</p> <p>In the wake of that wobble, anti-abortion groups reacted enthusiastically to Ryan's debate performance. The Susan B Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion, said that Ryan had \"explained the pro-life position with clarity and candor. The Romney-Ryan ticket is clearly committed to protecting American women and unborn children.\"</p> <p>Paradoxically, the easiest way that a Romney presidency could neutralise the grip of \"unelected judges\" on the country's abortion policy would be to change the balance of the US supreme court \u2013 in other words, to appoint new \"unelected judges\" who would take a different view to the current crop of nine. Over the next four years there is likely to be at least one and maybe more vacancies on the panel, with speculation that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 79, who is firmly in the pro-choice wing of the court, might retire.</p> <p>Joe Biden raised the question of supreme court appointments during the debate, predicting that as president Romney would select \"far right\" justices dedicated to outlawing abortion. The vice-president exhorted voters to \"keep an eye on the supreme court\", arguing that President Obama's two picks \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 were both \"open-minded\" and \"good justices\".</p>",
  "<p>Hopes that the computer hacker Gary McKinnon will win his 10-year legal battle against extradition have been significantly raised after Home Office-appointed psychiatrists warned that he would be very likely to attempt suicide if sent for trial in the US.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, is expected to announce her decision to parliament on Tuesday morning. McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, said she has been given no prior word about the likely verdict. However, the family has been shown a new government-commissioned medical report into the mental condition of McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome and has suffered severe depression.</p> <p>The study, by Professor Declan Murphy and Professor Tom Fahy of the Institute of Psychiatry, has been seen by the Guardian and spells out the risks the government would face if it pressed ahead with McKinnon's extradition.</p> <p>It is particularly significant because the same experts concluded in July that McKinnon's risk of suicide was \"moderate\". Since then they have studied reports from three experts in Asperger's and suicide \u2013 Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, Professor Jeremy Turk and Dr Jan Vermeulen \u2013 who examined McKinnon earlier this year.</p> <p>The new report is dated 24 September. In a section headed \"Opinion\", Murphy and Fahy write: \"It is clear from [Vermeulen's] report that there is a significant risk of suicidal behaviour and that Mr McKinnon 'will do' what he has threatened for the last three to four years if the extradition proceeds. On this specific point, we cannot offer reassurance to the authorities who are dealing with this case.\"</p> <p>Sharp said the family was delighted at the experts' change of opinion: \"I was really surprised when I read it, and so was Gary's solicitor. I didn't expect it.</p> <p>\"Although it's saying bad things about Gary's health, it's very good news. For them to come out and say Gary not even might or could but will take his own life if it proceeds, and they can give no reassurances, I would have thought it would be very difficult for the government to go ahead.\"</p> <p>McKinnon, 46, was arrested in March 2002 for allegedly hacking into dozens of Pentagon and Nasa computers over a 13-month period from a bedroom in north London. He admitted the security breaches but denied any malicious intent, saying he was looking for evidence of UFOs, and that notes he left mocking the lack of security were merely mischievous. US officials insist he caused thousands of dollars' worth of damage and want to prosecute him on charges that could bring a jail sentence of 60 years.</p> <p>Much of the subsequent extradition fight, which has seen McKinnon's lawyers appeal unsuccessfully to the House of Lords and the European court of human rights, has centred on his mental health and the possible risk of suicide if he is extradited.</p> <p>Sharp's campaigning over the years has played a significant role, particularly as she secured guarantees of support from the Liberal Democrats while they were in opposition and, to a lesser extent, the Conservatives. David Cameron has raised the case twice in meetings with Barack Obama in a presumed attempt to smooth the diplomatic path towards an eventual decision not to extradite.</p> <p>However, Sharp, from south Hertfordshire, said the delay since the new government took power had been agonising.</p> <p>\"Before the coalition got in Nick Clegg stood by my side outside the Home Office to support me, and David Cameron spoke up for Gary and said he should be tried here. When they won the election we wept as we thought Gary was home and dry. Then nothing happened. Then Theresa May put a stop on it and we thought, fantastic. Again nothing happened. After that, David Cameron said the decision would come in weeks, not months. Then somebody in the Home Office decided they needed more medical reports.\"</p> <p>May's decision was due in July but was delayed until October because of the Olympics.</p> <p>The Home Office declined to say when May would make her announcement, only that the high court had directed that it should be \"on or around\" 16 October.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"This is a complex case, in a complex area of the law, and a large amount of material has been submitted, some of it relatively recently. The home secretary needs to consider all the material carefully before making a decision.\"</p> <p>Sharp said she would go to her son's home nearby and await the decision with him. The 10-year battle had taken an enormous toll on them both, she said.</p> <p>\"It's the most cruel and horrendous thing, and it's the only thing in our minds 24 hours a day. It's the only thing I can talk about. I've gone through all our money. Gary hasn't got an outlet. He can't go online. He's a really good musician but he hasn't touched an instrument for years because he can't deal with what it would bring up. So he sits in the dark with his cats. He's lost 10 years of his life.</p> <p>\"I just want Gary to recover mentally, to get back to being himself, not seeing the world as this big, dark, cruel place. He's a good guy and it's all so sad.\"</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p><strong>February 2002</strong> McKinnon allegedly hacks into 97 US military and Nasa computers from north London.</p> <p><strong>19 March 2002</strong> McKinnon is arrested by British police.</p> <p><strong>31 October 2002</strong> The district court of New Jersey issues a warrant for his arrest.</p> <p><strong>2004</strong> The US government files a request to have McKinnon extradited.</p> <p><strong>10 May 2006</strong> A district judge recommends McKinnon's extradition, but leaves the final decision to the then home secretary, John Reid.</p> <p><strong>4 July</strong> Reid signs an order to extradite him to the US.</p> <p><strong>3 April 2007</strong> McKinnon loses a high court appeal against his extradition.</p> <p><strong>30 July 2008</strong> McKinnon loses a House of Lords appeal against his extradition.</p> <p><strong>25 August 2008</strong> He is diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome.</p> <p><strong>28 August 2008</strong> The European court of human rights rules it will not prevent McKinnon's extradition.</p> <p><strong>1 August 2009</strong> McKinnon loses a further high court appeal.</p> <p><strong>13 January 2010</strong> A high court judge says McKinnon would be a suicide risk if extradited and the home secretary may have acted unlawfully by pursuing his case.</p> <p><strong>20 May 2012</strong> Theresa May, now home secretary, puts the extradition on hold to consider new medical evidence.</p> <p><strong>21 July 2012</strong> After meeting Barack Obama, David Cameron, says McKinnon could instead serve time in a UK jail.</p> <p><strong>16 October 2012</strong> May is due to tell the House of Commons of her decision.</p>",

Protesters sympathetic to leftwing and liberal political forces were kicked out of the square after their anti-Morsi chants, only to return in greater numbers. Violence flared when Morsi supporters barred their path in the roads leading to Tahrir.</p> <p>One man, Ibrahim El-Sheikhh, who was wounded in a beating from Morsi supporters, told the Guardian: \"They trapped us from both sides after attacking our stage where we were chanting. As they beat me they chanted <em>Allahu Akbar</em> [God is Great] and said they'd kidnap me, but I managed to escape. This is the Muslim Brotherhood.\"</p> <p>The original protest had been organised by secular political forces ostensibly to protest against the monopolisation of the drafting of Egypt's new constitution by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups. Secular political activists have often complained about Islamist hegemony in post-revolution Egypt.</p> <p>There had been an escalation in anti-Morsi sentiment after 24 stalwarts of the Hosni Mubarak regime were acquitted in the \"Battle of the Camel\" trial on Wednesday. They had been charged in connection with attacks on protesters in Tahrir Square in February last year. Morsi supporters also protested the acquittals.</p> <p>In response, the president attempted to remove the country's general prosecutor, the Mubarak appointee Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud, by appointing him ambassador to the Vatican. Egyptian law, however, prohibits the removal of the general prosecutor and Mahmoud refused to vacate his post.</p> <p>As night fell, after hours of clashes with no intervention by security forces, the Morsi supporters appeared to leave the square, while their opponents chanted: \"Down with Morsi Mubarak.\"</p>",
  "<p>A group of 50 Islamic clerics in Pakistan have issued a fatwa against the Taliban gunmen who tried to kill a 14-year-old girl, famous for campaigning for the right of young females to an education.</p> <p>The Islamic scholars from the Sunni Ittehad Council publicly denounced attempts by the Pakistani Taliban to mount religious justifications for the shooting of Malala Yousafzai and two of her classmates as they sat inside a school bus on Tuesday.</p> <p>A Taliban spokesman issued a statement on Wednesday claiming it was obligatory to kill anyone \"leading a campaign\" against Islamic law. The movement has also said they would attempt to kill Yousafzai again if she recovers from her injuries.</p> <p>Hamid Saeed Kazmi, a former religious affairs minister, replied that Islam \"holds the killing of one innocent person as killing the entirety of humanity\".</p> <p>There was continued outrage over the attack, which has left Yousafzai in a critical condition at a Pakistani military hospital after surgery to remove a bullet from near her spinal cord. Authorities are offering a reward of $100,000 for the capture of her attackers.</p> <p>Local police in Mingora, the largest city in Swat, said Friday they had arrested a number of suspects.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Pakistani military, which has taken responsibility for her care in one of its hospitals, said the next two days would be critical for Yousafzai.</p> <p>Across the country, a national day of prayer was observed in schools and mosques for the young peace activist who became famous after writing a blog in 2009 for the BBC Urdu service about life under the Taliban insurgency. Some newspapers on Friday even suggested the army might now consider mounting operations in North Waziristan, the centre of the country's militancy problem, which the military has long resisted confronting despite entreaties from the US.</p> <p>Sceptics, however, fear nothing will change, noting the handful of tiny public demonstrations on behalf of Yousafzai have been dwarfed by the huge, violent protests that greeted the YouTube trailer for the blasphemous Innocence of Muslims film last month.</p> <p>One human rights activist said that while there was \"a great big moderate majority\" in Pakistan but \"it never speaks up\".Several commentators have also noted that, although almost all political parties have condemned the act, often in extremely harsh terms, most are unwilling to single out the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, even though it gleefully claimed responsibility.</p> <p>\"It shows that they have not yet really discarded the Taliban,\" said Zohra Yusuf, head of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.</p> <p>She added: \"There is fear element as well but they do have a soft corner \u2013 they have never tried to hide that.\"</p>",
  "<p>At La Place du Martinet at the very top of the Combe d'Ire, a handful of wilted flowers give the only clue to the mysterious events at this Alpine beauty spot just over a month ago, when a British family and a French cyclist were gunned down.</p> <p>Police barriers blocking the winding, unmade road have been removed and the local amateur cyclists who puff their way up the challenging climb have returned.</p> <p>The Combe d'Ire has become an endurance test for all, not least the French and British investigators who are still baffled by the shooting of Surrey-based engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife, Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, as well as local cyclist Sylvain Mollier.</p> <p>Newly discovered photographs of the Hillis with their daughters Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, who survived the attack, only add to the mystery. The holiday snaps, which have not been released, were taken by Mr Hilli and show his wife, mother and daughters smiling outside a picture-postcard local house, decked with flowers, close to the nearby village of Doussard, half a mile from where the attack happened.</p> <p>Detectives believe that minutes after the pictures were taken, the family were killed. Officers believe the snaps go some way to discrediting claims that the 50-year-old had driven his family up the Combe d'Ire for a prearranged \"secret\" meeting, but admit they are sure of nothing.</p> <p>\"Every lead is still being investigated. But looking at the photos, it's clear these were people who had no idea what was waiting for them,\" said a source close to the inquiry. \"It was just before they were killed, but they don't look in the slightest bit worried. They are all smiling. It's a normal, happy holiday photograph.\"</p> <p>The investigating judge has refused to release the pictures, deeming them too morbid.</p> <p>The three adults in the family's BMW estate were shot in the head twice. Mollier, the French cyclist who appears to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, was shot with at least five bullets. Police found a total of 25 bullet casings at the scene. Some of the shells were found inside the car, which was still running when the murder victims were discovered, suggesting some shots were fired at close range.</p> <p>Zainab was pistol-whipped and left for dead, while Zeena cowered terrified under her dead mother's legs for eight hours before being discovered by police, who had sealed off the scene to avoid having evidence contaminated until the arrival of a specialist forensic science team.</p> <p>Police reopened the Place du Martinet and the Combe d'Ire shortly after the killings, then closed it, fearing \"murder tourism\" and an invasion of journalists. Last week, alongside the dessicating flowers, police also found the ashes of a recent campfire.</p> <p>Last week a public prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, appealed for witnesses who may have seen the Hillis' car. According to sources, police are struggling under a weight of evidence including documents relating to Iraqi-born Mr Hilli's affairs in Spanish, Arabic and English, which need to be translated. Sources say police are \"optimistic\" but not confident of solving the case rapidly. \"They are exploring every lead, every person, every bit of paper, without really knowing what they are looking for,\" said one local journalist close to the inquiry. \"Nobody in the case appears to be normal and straightforward.\"</p> <p>In the past five weeks, 650 people have been interviewed by detectives, but few pieces of the jigsaw have come together, hence a new hotline and the request for witnesses. \"Any witness having complementary information about the events of 5 September 2012 at Doussard, on the route de la Combe d'Ire and on the al-Hilli family's stay in France \u2026 all those who may have had contact with this British family, as well as those present in the Chevaline and Doussard area the afternoon of the incident are asked to contact the gendarmerie,\" the appeal read.</p> <p>Last week, it was claimed the family had a Swiss bank account and that Mr Hilli had been in Geneva shortly before his death. An illegal Taser gun was found in the family's Surrey home.</p> <p>Police are unconvinced by suggestions the real target may have been Mollier, a local father of three said to have worked for the French nuclear giant Areva. Mollier, they say, worked as a welder in a workshop at a subsidiary of Areva. \"He doesn't appear to have been exposed to nuclear secrets,\" said a source.</p>",

  "<p>Turkey has scrambled fighter jets to its border with Syria for the first time since warning its southern neighbour that fast escalating tensions between the two former allies could lead to war.</p> <p>Officials in Ankara said on Friday the jets were deployed in response to the presence of a Syrian helicopter firing near the town of Azmarin, about 8km from Turkey's south-west border. The town has seen intense fighting between regime forces and rebels since Monday.</p> <p>The Turkish jets fired no shots, but their response to a Syrian aircraft flying close to the frontier is being interpreted as a sign that prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan may be prepared to enforce a de facto no-fly zone inside Syrian airspace.</p> <p>Officials told Turkish media last week that Syria had agreed to keep its forces up to 10km (6.2 miles) from the restive 900km-long border with Turkey. Damascus did not respond to the claim, which came after Ankara won parliamentary approval to enter Syrian territory on hit and run missions, following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/turkey-syrian-mortar-bomb\" title=\"\">shelling of the Turkish town</a> Ak\u00e7akale, which killed five civilians.</p> <p>The cross-border shellfire that led to Turkey's dramatic move continued for at least six days after the law was passed, stirring already incendiary tensions and casting doubt on the Turkish claim of a deal, which if true would mark a significant moment in the Syrian civil war.</p> <p>The Syrian air force has been increasingly deployed over the country's towns and cities since July and has been a formidable foe for opposition groups with limited means to down regime jets and helicopters.</p> <p>Although several of each have been shot down with anti-aircraft cannons, rebels have taken to attacking airbases. One such attack on the Taaneh base east of Aleppo late on Thursday is believed to have left the giant airfield in rebel hands.</p> <p>Claims of the base's capture were supported by videos posted online, which showed large missiles and several aircraft as uniformed rebels moved among them. Eyewitness accounts of Syrian jets bombing weapons depots within the airfield's boundaries also supported the rebel claims to have taken the base. The bombing seemed to be aimed at preventing planes and weapons from falling into opposition hands.</p> <p>Opposition groups in Idlib have also attacked airbases, with a confirmed raid on one airfield in September destroying five helicopters and damaging several more.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Turkish officials suggested that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/11/syrian-passenger-plane-turkey-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Syrian commercial airliner intercepted by the Turkish air force</a> on Wednesday was carrying components for weapons systems sent by Russia. The plane and its passengers, which took off from Moscow, were allowed to continue to Damascus after being grounded at Esenboga airport, Ankara, for several hours. The incident continued to draw fierce criticism from Moscow, which has denied sending a cargo of weapons or ammunition, and from Damascus, which accused the Turks of air piracy.</p> <p>The flight engineer of the plane told Syrian media on Friday that he and other officers were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/12/syrian-air-turkish-video\" title=\"\">handcuffed by Turkish officials as the plane was searched</a>. As the civil war has escalated over the past year, Turkey has also twice brought to ground Iranian planes flying over its airspace that it suspected of carrying weapons to Damascus. Both groundings drew similar protests from Tehran.</p> <p>In the wake of the tensions, on Thursday Turkey said it had banned its carriers from travelling over Syrian airspace.</p>",
  "<p>A profit warning from industrial group <strong>Morgan Crucible Company</strong> sent shares lower across the engineering sector.</p> <p>The advanced materials company, which provides carbon technology services to the aerospace industry as well as ceramics and body armour, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/08/industrials-cookson-profit-warning-ftse?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">hit earlier in the week </a>after a sector peer <strong>Cookson</strong> issued its own warning of a slowdown.</p> <p>But after it said trading had deteriorated in the third quarter across most of its markets, particularly in Europe and China, its shares lost 28.5p to 227.3p. The slowdown was most pronounced in its advanced materials and technology business, including a delay in body armour contracts from the second half until 2013.</p> <p>Third quarter revenue was around 10% lower than in the first quarter, so its full year performance would be \"materially below the board's previous expectations.\" It said it was taking actions to cut costs, with a \u00a315m charge in 2012 but annual benefits of \u00a37m to \u00a38m.</p> <p>Harry Philips at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> Following on from Cookson, it will be a case of spotting the next warning. <strong>IMI</strong> and <strong> Bodycote International </strong>will top many lists but the lack of a Chinese/Asian exposure will be a plus \u2013 much of Morgan and Cookson is the lack of an second half pick up the region. </blockquote> <p>IMI dropped 21.5p to 904p, Bodycote fell 22.9p to 351.3p, automotive and aerospace group <strong>GKN</strong> lost 7.1p to 209.9p, Cookson closed 9p lower at 530.5p and controls group <strong>Spectris </strong>slid 112p to \u00a315.49.</p> <p>In a rather timely move, analysts at N+1 Singer cut their recommendation Spectris from buy to hold. They said:</p> <blockquote> We have reduced our forecasts for Spectris, ahead of its third quarter trading statement next week, to reflect the weakening industrial backdrop. We have cut our earnings per share estimates by around 6% [for the next three years]. We have also reduced our target price from 1950p to 1780p. </blockquote> <p>Overall, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 36.43 points to 5793.32 as Thursday's rally ran out of steam. Over the week the index lost around 80 points as the eurozone crisis dragged on, with investors anticipating a Spanish bailout request as Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the country's credit rating to BBB minus, one notch above junk status. Talks about Greece's austerity budget also continued, despite a flying visit from German chancellor Angela Merkel to Athens to show support for the country's government.</p> <p>But better than expected US consumer confidence figures and helped limit the damage.</p> <p>Banks turned in a mixed performance after contrasting results from US firms JP Morgan Chase - better than expected - and Wells Fargo - disappointing. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> added 0.45p to 39.7p but <strong>Barclays</strong> dipped 0.45p to 232.2p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 2.9p to 270.9p. RBS floated its <strong>Direct Line</strong> subsidiary on Thursday at 175p a share, and the insurer closed at 186.5p, down 1.5p on the day.</p> <p>Elsewhere it proved to be a mixed day for Roman Abramovich.</p> <p><strong>Evraz</strong>, the Russian steelmaker controlled by the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 13.3p to 234.3p after it temporarily shut its Czech production line due to low demand. The European sector has been hit by the economic downturn, as well as rising costs and cheap imports.</p> <p>At the same time analysts at Credit Suisse cut their recommendation from neutral to underperform and their target price from 310p to 200p, on falling iron ore and coking coal prices:</p> <blockquote> As Evraz has a high level of vertical integration with a fairly high cost of mining, it remains highly leveraged to the global bulk commodities' downcycles. As we downgrade iron ore and coking coal price assumptions for 2013-14, we expect a large portion of Evraz's mining operations to become loss-making in 2013. </blockquote> <p>But on the bright side for Abramovich, Aim-listed <strong>AFC Energy</strong>, the fuel cell company where his Ervington Investments is paying \u00a38.7m for a 15% stake, added nearly 16% to 38.5p following Thursday's news of his involvement.</p> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 30.5p lower at 715.5p after Barclays moved from overweight to equal weight and cut its price target from 910p t0 765p in a hefty note on the mining sector. On the general market conditions, the bank said:</p> <blockquote> In 2012 we believe commodity and equity prices have followed a fairly logical and predictable path, as have company management teams. We believe the next step will be an increase in Chinese fixed asset investment, leading to further commodity and equity price increases. </blockquote> <p>On Kazakhmys in particular, it said:</p> <blockquote> Our view on Kazakhmys was premised on the assumptions that 1) management had its high cost structure under control and 2) the market had priced this in, neither of which was nor seems to be true now. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Bumi</strong> continued its recovery after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/11/nat-rothschild-bumi-bakrie-family\" title=\"\">plans to abandon its Indonesian coal business</a> and become a cash shell, adding 21p to 280p.</p> <p><strong>WH Smith</strong> added 5p to 636p, recovering some of Thursday's fall in the wake of news that Kate Swann, widely regarded as having done a good job at the retailer, was stepping down as chief executive next summer. There was some speculation she could move on to <strong>Home Retail</strong>, down 0.7p at 104.3p, the owner of her former employer Argos. but analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> It was interesting that the shorts started to run for cover in Home Retail yesterday, on the fear that Kate Swann will march in as chief executive next summer and sort the business out, but successful executives don't usually go back to companies they've worked at before. </blockquote> <p><strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> moved 24p higher to 712p after an upbeat trading statement. The investment firm reported record assets under management of \u00a32bn and revenues up 20% in the first quarter. It said:</p> <blockquote> Future stock market levels and investor confidence will have a significant part to play during the remainder of our financial year. In the coming months we will be launching our iPad app and a number of other major new initiatives. </blockquote> <p>It should also benefit from a shake-up of the way financial products are sold. From next year, commissions will be replaced by a fee-based system and Hargreaves believes it has put in place a competitive structure ahead of the changes.</p> <p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> fell 1.4p to 327.1p as the group began looking for a plan B following Wednesday's collapse of its proposed merger with EADS.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the defence sector, <strong>Chemring</strong> climbed 7.4p to 342.7p after a deadline for US private equity group Carlyle to either make a firm offer or walk away was extended by the takeover panel from last night to 9 November.</p> <p>Chemring said the move was \"to enable the parties to continue their ongoing discussions regarding a possible offer.\"</p> <p>The company, which makes flares, ejector seat mechanisms and bomb detectors, initially announced it had received an approach in mid-August, but a subsequent profit warning raised fears that the predator, Carlyle, might walk away, or at least make a lower offer than originally planned.</p> <p>Analysts took the latest extension as a good sign. Roger Johnston at Edison Investment Research said:</p> <blockquote> [This] shows the two sides are trying to thrash out a deal. I still feel it is unlikely a trade buyer will emerge at this time and therefore this is all about price now. Carlyle will feel under no pressure to bid high while Chemring management will not want to go out with a whimper so this will be a finely balanced negotiation. I suggest a price around the 400p mark will be enough to clinch the deal, but whether Carlyle feels this reflects defence uncertainties enough is another matter. </blockquote>",
  "<p>At a time when Europe seems on the brink of falling apart, when Europeans are taking to the streets to express their wrath towards other partners in the union and when mainstream politicians in the UK are looking for a way out of the club, a decision by a group of Norwegian intellectuals to prompt the question: what has the EU done for us? We take a look at some of the more positive impacts the EU has had on our lives.</p> <h2>Peace</h2> <p>The origins of peace in Europe lie in the alliance made between France and Germany t gave birth to the European Coal and Steel Community, a forerunner of the EU. The ECSC was first conceived by Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister in 1950 \"to make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible\". The continent has indeed enjoyed lasting peace. International security remains one of the EU's top priorities, not just in Europe but the rest of the world.</p> <h2>Single market</h2> <p>The single market is probably the EU's single biggest achievement after peace, though it's arguably hard to separate the two. It guarantees the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. Apart from the unifying effect of this set-up on European citizens, it has provided the opportunity for them to travel, live, work, study and do business across the union, and to enjoy a wide range of competitively-priced services and goods.</p> <h2>Single currency</h2> <p>The eurozone was established in 1999 and is made up of 17 member states. Despite the threats it has faced in recent years, it is likely to remain a central part of Europeans' everyday life. Most Europeans see the benefits it brings to them as travellers - not having to convert moneywhile away on holiday or business. But its main practical benefit has to do with economic growth. It has helped to strengthen the EU's international standing and improve integration within the union itself.</p> <h2>Easier, passport-free travel</h2> <p>Since the 15 member countries which signed up to the Schengen agreement abandoned their border posts, it is possible to travel freely and easily not just to Tuscany and Dordogne, but across huge swaths of the union. Driving licenses are valid across the continent, while the single currency standardised trains and the fact that holidaymakers are fully covered for emergency hospital treatment in other EU countries have all encouraged freedom of movement.</p> <h2>Foreign aid</h2> <p>The EU accounts for half of all global aid. Last year, it donated \u20ac53.1bn (\u00a342.8bn). The European commission by itself is the world's second largest bilateral donor after the US, providing \u20ac12.3bn of external aid in 2011. Aid constitutes about 9% of the EU budget. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's peer review of EU aid in 2012 found that the body was a \"formidable player in global development\" that had taken \"positive steps to make the programme more effective and increase its impact\" since its previous review in 2007. The European commission is ranked the fifth most transparent donor in the world out of 72, above every EU member state except the UK and the Netherlands.</p> <h2>Cheaper and safer flights</h2> <p>Increased competition between airlines operating within the member states introduced in the 1980s and 90s has provided us with cheaper flights to a much wider range of destinations than ever before. Flights are also safer as a result of tightened regulations and improvements in air traffic control.</p> <h2>Democracy and human rights</h2> <p>Brussels sets standards of human rights, democracy and the rule of law to which countries must adhere if they want to be part of the European Union. In practical terms these guidelines have had a particular impact on the countries of southern, central and eastern Europe, which joined after they emerged from dictatorships with often underdeveloped civil societies.</p> <h2>Equal opportunities</h2> <p>The EU has tackled discrimination on the basis of gender, race, age and disability with a range of different directives which have had their biggest impact on the labour market.</p> <h2>Cheaper telephone calls</h2> <p>In the 1990s the EU liberalised the telecommunications markets. That together with new technology has led to considerably lower prices. The cost of international telephone calls has fallen by more than 80% in the last 30 years, while mobile phone roaming charges have also been significantly reduced.</p> <h2>Improved air and water quality</h2> <p>Member states have demonstrated their own appetite for protecting the environment, but they would arguably not have done so much had pressure not been applied by the EU via legislation to improve the quality of rivers, seas and beaches, and reduce acid rain and sulphur emissions.</p>",

  "<p>The timing is nothing if not ironic. On the day the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/european-union-nobel-peace-prize\" title=\"\">EU has been awarded the Nobel peace prize</a>, we watch as Europe sits idly by and lets fascism brew once again \u2013 this time in Greece. If a sharp turn towards religious fundamentalism and fascism is to be avoided, Europe needs to act now.</p> <p>On Thursday night the Athens premiere of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi_(play)\" title=\"\">Terrence McNally's play, Corpus Christi</a>, was cancelled following <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_12/10/2012_465813\" title=\"\">protests by members of the far-right party Golden Dawn</a> (including some MPs) and religious groups.</p> <p>The protest had a clearly homophobic agenda. Manolis V, a journalist, was attacked by protesters while the police apparently did nothing: \"The police is next to us. I shout 'They're beating me, aren't you going to do something?',\" he wrote on Twitter. \"I move away so I can look on from distance. A well-known Golden Dawn MP follows me. He punches me twice in the face and knocks me to the ground. While on the ground, I lose my glasses. The Golden Dawn MP kicks me. The police are just two steps away but turn their back.\"</p> <p>The spectacle of fascists physically attacking people whose moral agenda they disapprove of has become routine in today's Greece. What should come as more of a shock is the tacit approval of the police.</p> <p>When four protesters were arrested, the Golden Dawn MP Christos Pappas boarded the police bus in which they were held, and released one of the prisoners. From the <a href=\"http://youtu.be/8MMR2cLSZio\" title=\"\">video depicting the incident</a>, we can see that no officer tried to stop him.</p> <p>Golden Dawn know that the police are on their side, and so do those they attack. Manolis says he is afraid to go to the police and file a lawsuit, because he doesn't want them to have his name and address on record.</p> <p>The police were not so slow to react two weeks ago when they arrested for blasphemy the man behind the satirical Facebook page of Geron Pastitsios after a question submitted in parliament by a Golden Dawn MP. Nor were they slow to react when anti-fascists clashed with Golden Dawn supporters in Amerikis square and 15 were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/greek-antifascist-protesters-torture-police\" title=\"\">arrested, and allegedly tortured</a>, last week. To add insult to injury, after announcing that they are conducting an investigation into a \"Golden Dawn MP\", the police refused to name him, despite having no problem naming teenagers who were preemptively arrested before a demonstration three weeks ago.</p> <p>The Greek Orthodox church, its huge wealth unscathed by the crisis, is in no rush to condemn its clerics for siding, condoning, instigating and participating in acts of violence and disrespect against immigrants, homosexuals and people who challenge their view of what being Greek and Orthodox entails.</p> <p>Greece is being held hostage by a police force that increasingly appears beyond state control, and which has long forsaken its role of protecting citizens from the thugs they now side with, and by a government which relishes the distraction the Golden Dawn provides from the cuts and tax hikes. The government's unwillingness to revoke parliamentary privileges from those Golden Dawn MPs who participate in or condone violent acts, and to speed up processes to have them prosecuted and condemned, demonstrates this.</p> <p>Not only have the Golden Dawn refused to apologise for their actions outside Corpus Christi, but the Golden Dawn MP Ilias Kasidiaris \u2013 famous for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/golden-dawn-tv-assault-greece\" title=\"\">physically assaulting a leftwing politician on live TV</a> \u2013 didn't miss the chance to hand out warnings: \"In any case where the religious sentiment of Greeks is insulted, the Golden Dawn will react dynamically,\" he said. \"If someone tries to stage a play making fun of Muhammad in a Muslim country, he will lose his head. They won't react peacefully as Greeks do.\"</p> <p>Judging by Sunday's protest, which Kasidiaris did not attend, \"peace\" equals abuse, censorship, violence and a complete disregard for the laws Golden Dawn supposedly venerate. Apparently we should just be thankful for not having our heads chopped off.</p> <p>It is once again time for the Greek people to ask themselves, is the Golden Dawn a legitimate political party? And, as Paul Mason asked a few days ago on Newsnight: is this even a democracy any more?</p>",
  "<p>Paddy Roy Bates, better-known as Prince Roy of Sealand \u2013 the title he awarded himself 36&#xa0;years ago \u2013 has died aged 91 in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, overlooking the Thames estuary where he earned fame as a modern buccaneer. One of the first of a raggle-taggle band of entrepreneurs who saw pirate radio as a goldmine, he bullied his way on&#xa0;to&#xa0;a&#xa0;couple of rusting sea forts, holding them against rival stations, foreign businessmen and even the British government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397990834\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350050777223/ROY-AND-JEAN-BATES-001.jpg\" alt=\"ROY AND JEAN BATES\" width=\"200\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy and Joan Bates, the self-styled Prince and Princess of Sealand, in 1978.  Photograph: Philippe Hays/Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Hays/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His antics in the 1960s and 70s were sometimes portrayed as a real-life version of the 1949 Ealing Studios comedy <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041737/\" title=\"IMDb: Passport to Pimlico\">Passport to Pimlico</a>, with jolly seadogs declaring independence on&#xa0;their mites of free territory. After the second of his forts, Roughs Tower, off Harwich, proved to be legally beyond Whitehall's reach, he named it <a href=\"http://www.sealandgov.org/\" title=\"\">Sealand</a>, the world's smallest country, with its own flag, money, stamps and football team. The Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra recorded its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w8akRVIq-Q\" title=\"\">national anthem</a>.</p> <p>But the tall and burly Bates, a former major in the British army who called his crew \"the hard bastards of the North Sea\", had little of the charm and PR skills of Ronan O'Reilly, his better-known and more successful rival at Radio Caroline. His men evicted Caroline and Radio City employees forcibly from the Roughs and its predecessor, Knock John, shooting one in the ear and seeing another lose his fingers when his hand was caught in a windlass chain during a&#xa0;struggle.</p> <p>Bates's own employees also had a&#xa0;tough time. The first two to garrison the Roughs began to develop scurvy after surviving on watered-down salad cream and instant coffee when a supposed two-day stint turned into nearly three weeks without supplies. Later in the history of the dismal pile, a steel platform on top of two concrete towers, there was more violence involving German and&#xa0;Dutch&#xa0;\"invaders\".</p> <p>The major's early life was colourful, according to his family, with a teenage escapade as a volunteer fighting General Franco in the Spanish civil war, followed by work at Smithfield meat market in London and then second world war service. After demobilisation, he made a living importing meat in Ireland and rubber in the UK before ending up in Essex with a small fleet of fishing boats.</p> <p>His radio venture was dogged by a dislike of pop music, and his Radio Essex station struggled to appeal with rehashes of \"smooth music\" figures such as Frank Sinatra and advertisements \u2013 some recorded by Bates in his living room in Westcliff-on-Sea \u2013 for upholstery and carpet-fitting. Outshone by O'Reilly, he might have been forgotten had it not been for a rash piece of flag-wagging by a lighthouse maintenance tender which sailed close to the Roughs in 1968 and was shot at with a 0.22 pistol.</p> <p>Bates and his 16-year-old son, Michael, soon to become Prince Michael of Sealand, were acquitted of firearms offences by the high court because the Roughs lay outside UK jurisdiction. A&#xa0;genuine piece of Pimlico diplomacy has since emerged from the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/\" title=\"National Archives website\">National Archives</a>: Harold Wilson's Labour government considered seizing the fort during their absence at court, but&#xa0;decided not to because it would \"smack of sharp practice\".</p> <p>Another civil service idea \u2013 deploying the Royal Marines when only Bates's wife and daughter, Princesses Joan and Penny, were in residence \u2013 was also rejected for similar PR reasons, with mockery likely to follow the marines going into action against two women. No such niceties deterred a&#xa0;succession of foreign business partners in the late 1970s and early 80s, who variously captured, lost and tried to sue the midget country and its royal family. One of them still heads what he calls Sealand's government-in-exile in&#xa0;Switzerland.</p> <p>The British government was relieved to be clear of any responsibility, especially when Bonn complained about the imprisonment on the fort of a West German national. The extension of UK waters to 12 miles in 1987 theoretically opened the way to fresh drama, but intervention has been limited to RAF and coastguard help in putting out a fire in 2006.</p> <p>Sealand's notoriety has never been matched by a succession of offshore dreams, with all manner of ideas being touted to inflate the value of the largely useless speck. Almost everything from casinos to Wikileaks has been mentioned as a possible tenant, but the family has had to supplement Sealand's exchequer with more realistic ways of&#xa0;attracting an income. Money comes in from some internet licences and the sale of spurious titles, but Prince Michael runs a couple of fishing boats, as&#xa0;his father did, and Princess Penny has&#xa0;a&#xa0;dog-grooming parlour.</p> <p>The fort retains a seedy glamour, however, along with its motto, E Mare Libertas \u2013 From the Sea, Freedom (even if rare visitors in the pirate-radio era were more likely to get Bates's greeting: \"What the **** do you want?\").</p> <p>Prince Michael described his father as&#xa0;\"quite an intimidating old boy\" and&#xa0;\"a huge, huge character\" who lived out a prophecy made long ago that whatever he died of, it would not be&#xa0;boredom. His wife and children survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrick Roy Bates, soldier and businessman, born 29 August 1921; died 9 October 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2012.

  "<p>The Gloucester flanker Andy Hazell faces a long ban after being sent off for kneeing in his side's Amlin Challenge Cup opener at Mont-de-Marsan on Thursday night but his club have asked for opposition players to join him at a disciplinary hearing for alleged eye-gouging.</p> <p>Hazell received a red card for the first time in his 12-year senior career after losing control in the second-half of a bad tempered match that Gloucester won 11-6.

The period may be extended in exceptional circumstances, one of them being if not all the video footage is available within the time laid down.</p> <p>\"Never had a red in 12 years, extremely embarrassed by my actions,\" said Hazell on Twitter. \"It was the third time someone tried to severely injure me and I reacted. In a way I wish I could take it back but when you are in that situation you do not know how you are going to react.\"</p> <p>Gloucester took pictures after the match of Hazell's eyes, which were reportedly red and inflamed, to use as evidence if the alleged incidents were not caught on camera.</p> <p>Nigel Davies, the Gloucester director of rugby, said: \"We'll speak to the citing commissioner and there will be something done there. We can't condone what was done, from a Gloucester view, but that was a reaction to what went on before.</p> <p>\"We'll take our punishment but I think they need to take theirs too. We'll look at the video and from what I've seen already I'm sure we will make a complaint. The doctor's had a look at Andy's eye, it was severely sore and very red.

  "<p>Patients entering hospital could be asked on their admissions form whether they wished to donate their organs for transplant under plans being considered by the NHS.</p> <p>Another potentially controversial suggestion involves recording the wishes of the dying and those placed on so-called \"end of life\" care by doctors.</p> <p>Incentivising donations by offering state subsidy of funeral costs, asking those filling in standard tax and passport forms to become donors, and raising <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Organ-donation/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">organ donation</a> issues with children at school are among ideas put forward in response to a survey in preparation for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/27/nhs-organ-donor-optout-transplants\" title=\"\">shake-up of organ transplantation</a>, which will challenge current ethical, professional and legal rules.</p> <p>Two other suggestions \u2013 including a box on the donor registration form saying \"I don't want my family to override my wish to donate\" and asking the next-of-kin as well as the donor to sign donor cards \u2013 are aimed at encouraging the discussion of donation within families but also reduce the possibility of grieving relatives trying to countermand donation decisions.</p> <p>Earlier this week authorities in Scotland suggested about 15% of potential organs for transplant are lost because families wanted to override their loved ones' dying wishes.</p> <p>Research published by the NHS Blood and Transplant authority <a href=\"http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/news/2012/newsrelease090712.html\" title=\"\">in the summer</a> suggested half those who wished to donate organs hadn't told family or friends. The NHSBT survey launched in July and completed last month asked about extending the practice by which the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre \"nudges\" those applying for driving licences into deciding whether they want to join the donor register to other documents, such as marriage applications or wills. The option is also already present on applications for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) which covers UK patients for free treatment within the EU.</p> <p>Sally Johnson, the NHSBT's director of organ donation and transplantation, has personally suggested using the new <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/universal-credit/\" title=\"\">universal credit</a>, the single payment to be launched next year for those seeking work or on low incomes. Many of the ideas would need ministerial approval from governments in the UK, and some legislation.</p> <p>Responses to the survey suggest medical support for ideas already floated by NHSBT, including presumed consent for organ donation unless people have actively opted out (an idea Welsh ministers want to implement in 2015) and using \"elective ventilation\" to prolong the lives of people who have no chance of survival in order to harvest their organs. This has not been tested legally. One move regarded by NHSBT at present as \"possibly a step too far\" - that the 19 million people on the organ donor register should get priority if they need a transplant - was backed too.</p> <p>Some ideas would mean hospitals needing more intensive care beds and more time in operating theatres devoted to organ removal and donation. The NHSBT board believes transplants should be concentrated at fewer specialist centres across the UK. At present, there are seven heart and lung centres, seven for pancreas transplants and 24 for kidney transplants.</p> <p>James Neuberger, NHSBT's associate medical director, said of discussing organ donation on hospital admission: \"We have to reassure people that the role of any healthcare professional is to save and improve life ... We have got to work very hard to maintain trust so that people have confidence that if they go into hospital that they will be there to get treated and cured if possible, and that donation is considered only when it is the right time. People need to have confidence too that we treat donated organs with respect, dignity and gratitude.\"</p> <p>Donors' wishes were paramount, said Neuberger. \"The key issue is that if somebody has indicated clearly they wish to be an organ donor at their death and their family are really very, very distressed and upset, then clinicians are faced with a difficult dilemma. You want to respect the wishes of the donor but in some circumstances, it is usually unanticipated, sudden death, you don't want to add unduly to the distress of the family. So there has to be some flexibility on this. The key thing is for the potential donor to let their families know so they are prepared, and they won't feel any reservation in having those wishes fulfilled.\"</p> <p>Although organ donation after death has increased, there are concerns this trend is slowing. About 1,000 people a year are said to die because they could not get a transplant. Senior managers at NHSBT will meet other experts later this month before drawing up priorities for change. Final drafts go to the organisation's board in January before being shared with UK health departments. The strategy will be published in April.</p> <p>There were nearly 3,960 organ transplants carried out in the UK last year involving donations from 2,134 donors, more than 1,000 of them living kidney donors.</p>",
  "<p>The company that makes London taxi cabs has launched an <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201210121254216106O\" title=\"\">emergency recall of 400 black cabs </a>after discovering a steering fault. It also suspended its shares and warned its financial poisition would be \"unclear\" until it had found a way to fix the fault.</p> <p>Manganese Bronze, which has been making black cabs since 1948, said it had been forced to recall the cabs and suspend all sales of its TX4 model after drivers reported serious problems with the power steering.</p> <p>The Coventry-based company - which manufactures the cabs in China - warned investors that the suspension of sales would have a \"very material and detrimental\" impact on its cash flow.</p> <p>The steering fault is just the latest problem to beset Manganese, which is 20% owned by Chinese car group Geely and has failed to turn a profit since 2007. This summer, just two days after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/12/london-2012-olympics-closing-ceremony-live#block-502826ca95cbf34442898d9f\" title=\"\">Spice Girls danced on top of five black cabs at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics</a> the company revealed a \u00a33.9m black hole in its accounts.</p> <p>Manganese's UK sales dropped 9% last year to 1,502 taxis. The company's shares, which were suspended at 10p valuing the company at just \u00a33m has, have fallen 70% in the past year. Just five years ago, they were changing hands at more than \u00a38 each.</p> <p>It is not the first time Manganese has been forced to launch an emergency recall of the TX4 model. Four years ago it called back 5,000 of the early TX4 after some of them caught fire.</p> <p>John Russell, chief executive of Manganese Bronze, said there had been two incidences of drivers \"struggling to steer the vehicles correctly\" due to the failure of the hydraulic system that powers the steering.</p> <p>Russell said that in both incidences a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circlip\" title=\"\">circlip</a>, which holds hydraulic fluid pipes in place, had either fallen off or been damaged. \"[This means] you get very erratic performance of the hydraulic fluid in the power steering, which results in odd characteristics [to the steering],\" he said.</p> <p>In both cases the drivers had been able to wrest back control of their vehicles and, Russell said, the fault had not led to any injuries.</p> <p>He said Manganese engineers had examined the vehicles \"and came to the conclusion that we did have a problem\".</p> <p>The company immediately began the recall and some of the affected vehicles are already off the streets. Russell said all owners and drivers of affected cabs were being contacted by phone and by letter.</p> <p>Russell said he was unable to say what had caused the problem or how long it would take to fix it. \"We know that drivers aren't earning a livelihood if they can't drive. That is a real issue, and we aim to get them back on the road and earning money as soon as possible,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are not going to have a witch hunt. We want to find a solution the root cause. Then we will discover who is to blame, and questions will get answered.\"</p> <p>However, Russell pointed out that the company had recently contracted a new Chinese company to supply its steering box. \"We firmly believed that we had a better supplier, and we went through a very thorough test evaluation,\" he said. \"We are very disappointed.\"</p> <p>He said Manganese holds a contract with the supplier that \"covers warranty and negligence, and that contract will come into play\".</p> <p>The company is also suffering from growing competition. Mercedes-Benz began selling its Vito cab in 2008 and now supplies almost a third of the capital's 22,000-cab fleet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/nissan-reveals-new-london-taxi\" title=\"\">Nissan is also planning to break into the market next year with the launch of a modified version of minivans currently used by cabbies in New York.</a></p> <p>\"We are having a real tough time of it,\" Russell said. \"But we are one of the great British icons and so we will continue to power on.</p> <p>\"Despite various attempts to build a better taxi, no one has made a better one than ours.\"</p>",
  "<p>A raucous cheer that went up in a packed county court room in Barnet this week could reverberate around the nation's town halls this winter.</p> <p>As David Cameron prepared to deliver his \"aspiration nation\" speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham, 110 miles away in Margaret Thatcher's former constituency a hotchpotch alliance of squatters, retired booksellers, local bloggers and international anti-capitalist activists whooped as a district judge blocked attempts to close a vibrant community library that has popped up in the shell of one controversially closed as part of the Conservative party's most radical experiment yet in shrinking local public services.</p> <p>In the month since the Friern Barnet library reopened \u2013 illegally, according to Barnet council, which wants the site sold to raise upwards of \u00a3400,000 \u2013 local residents have donated 5,000 books to restock the shelves.</p> <p>A volunteer staff of guerrilla librarians have kept the building open 48 hours a week; there are children's story sessions and exercise classes; and the lights are kept burning by donations dropped into a biscuit tin.</p> <p>It might sound like an exemplary vision of the so-called \"big society\": a community looking after itself following the retreat of the state.</p> <p>But the sale of this 78-year-old library is part of the radical reform proposals formulated by Barnet \u2013 labelled \"easyCouncil\" for its vision of a no-frills approach. Plans include outsourcing \u00a31bn of contracts to private companies for running everything from the crematorium to the planning and building control departments, sharing lawyers with another council, closing day centres for the elderly and quadrupling some parking fees.</p> <p>Judge Marc Marin ordered a full trial of the competing claims to the library, to the disappointment of the council. Peter Phoenix, the blond, dreadlocked spokesman of the council's opponents, was delighted.</p> <p>\"It looks like the kids get Christmas in the library,\" he said with a whoop. \"We've got Conservative central office worried here. They wanted to have success here and then roll this model out across all the boroughs.\"</p> <p>The need to make cuts is real but the big question is how to do it. Barnet has published a chart \u2013 known locally as \"the graph of doom\" \u2013 which shows how it will have no money to spend on anything apart from children's services and adult social services by 2030 because of rising costs and declining and flat budgets.</p> <p>Its \"One Barnet\" policy is perhaps the most radical response yet to 28% cuts in Whitehall funding of local authorities across England and Wales.</p> <p>\"We have been cutting for 10 years in Barnet,\" said Richard Cornelius, leader of the council. \"We can't keep salami slicing so we have had a complete look at the way we do things. Our idea is to take the money out of administration and keep providing the services, but we won't be doing it directly. We are scheduled to save more than \u00a365m.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think Mr and Mrs Resident are too bothered about who delivers the services,\" added Dan Thomas, deputy leader of the council with responsibility for finances.</p> <p>\"Yes, it's a bold move because it is the first time some of these services have been outsourced in local government, but there's nothing wrong with being first.\"</p> <p>According to local government analyst Andy Mudd, in a report for the public services union Unison, the reforms go to \"the heart of local government responsibilities for the safeguard and protection of public health and economic wellbeing\".</p> <p>He said \"the impact of failure could be catastrophic\". Opponents believe the project is already in trouble and the prospect of a trial over the library is not the only problem.</p> <p>The council's own figures, seen by the Guardian, reveal that over the last two years the borough has spent \u00a3670,000 more on trying to save money than it has actually saved, although the project is now edging into the black. The programme has so far cost \u00a36.36m, while the savings have amounted to \u00a35.69m.</p> <p>Last week, one of the chief architects of the reforms, council chief executive Nick Walkley, resigned unexpectedly, while councillor Brian Coleman, who oversaw the privatisation of parking services, is currently on police bail after allegations he assaulted a woman who filmed him parking in a loading bay.</p> <p>Other hard-cutting Tory councils appear to be in crisis too. The deputy leader of Cornwall county council resigned on Thursday over a \u00a3300m outsourcing plan that is facing a popular revolt. The council had hoped to save \u00a32.5m a year by outsourcing services including payroll, benefits and libraries. In his resignation letter, Jim Currie said: \"The financial risks involved with the rush into the new joint venture proposals are unacceptable. The joint venture is basically too large to control.\"</p> <p>Last year, Suffolk county council halted its own \"virtual council\" plan to outsource its services.</p> <p>In Barnet, emotions are running high and Thomas concedes there can be \"shouting and screaming\" in council meetings.</p> <p>BT, Capita and EC Harris are vying to take over two major contracts \u2013 one estimated to be worth up to \u00a3275m over 10 years to run building control, planning, highways and transport, the crematorium and cemetery, trading standards, licensing and environmental health.</p> <p>The planned outsourcing of back office services has been estimated to be worth up to \u00a3750m. Youth services have been cut almost in half from six youth centres in 2010 to three this year and the number of full-time equivalent staff has been cut from 99 to 55.</p> <p>A nurse working in sheltered housing where wardens have been removed told the Guardian: \"I have residents who sit in their nightclothes all day because they cannot afford the alternative. Where is the dignity in this?</p> <p>\"These same folk who used to love going to a day centre can no longer go as, they tell me, it costs \u00a335 per day and an extra \u00a35 for transport. So now they sit all day, staring at four walls or at the TV. Where have we gone so wrong?\"</p> <p>All this has been met by an insurgency of residents, trade unions and a broad coalition of investigative bloggers. Their names give a clue to the knockabout tone of political debate: Mrs Angry writes a blog called Broken Barnet, while others go under the names Mr Reasonable, Mr Mustard, Barnet Eye and Citizen Barnet.</p> <p>\"The community library is the 'big society' by definition, but it is not the 'big society' as the government envisaged it,\" said Mrs Angry, whose real name is Theresa Musgrove. \"They wanted the 'big society' to be obedient and to enable the cuts they wanted.\"</p> <p>This is an ecumenical insurrection where full-time activists and union leaders worried about jobs are joined by retirees and local mothers. The cause has attracted the support of the leftwing film-maker Ken Loach, who has contributed to a documentary about the matter called The Billion Pound Gamble.</p> <p>But there is also anecdotal evidence that the aggression of the council's cuts is alienating core Conservative voters.</p> <p>Ann Foskett, a Tory-voting grandmother who has lived in the area for 40 years, dropped off a bag of books at the library as the activists celebrated their court victory with tea and biscuits. She said the closure was \"absolutely scandalous\" adding: \"I do vote Tory normally, but things have gone to pot, particularly for old people. There used to be lots of local groups meeting in libraries, but there's nothing now.\"</p>",

  "<p>Alongside the shocking revelations of the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal, a disturbing picture of misogyny and sexual harassment in the media during the 1970s and 80s has emerged. Anne Robinson was cutting her teeth as a reporter at the time, before moving to the BBC. Her daughter Emma Wilson joined the industry decades later. Oliver Laughland listens in as they discuss how far the media has changed.</p> <p><strong>Anne Robinson:</strong> The Jimmy Savile saga has taken on a much darker and uglier tone. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/11/jimmy-savile-sex-abuse-claims?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">allegations about children at Stoke Mandeville hospital</a> being abused by him while those with a duty of care apparently failed to act are truly shocking. We need to distinguish between that and how life was generally for women in the workplace in the late 60s and early 70s, when the term sexual harassment didn't exist. My first job in Fleet Street was at the Daily Mail. There was an idiot chief sub who would yell for you to bring your copy over to the back bench. He would take it, drop it on the floor, so that you would bend over and pick it up, so that all the guys could have a look at your knickers \u2013 we weren't allowed to wear trousers in those days.</p> <p><strong>Emma Wilson:</strong> When I started in TV [Jimmy Savile] was definitely someone you thought was an odd character, and it doesn't surprise me. One of the things that has changed since I entered the industry, aged 19, is that now there are women bosses in the hierarchy. The beauty of women is that we talk, and in a heartbeat someone's inappropriate behaviour is going to be in a text, in a tweet, a phone call. Usually it's expressed in humour \u2013 but when you go on to the next job, everyone knows which are the dressing rooms to give a wide berth to.</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> Looking back, we used to keep lists of men who weren't safe in taxis, \"NST\", and those who were \"NSL\", not safe in lifts, they were a bit quicker with their hands than NSTs. I think my best experience was with Charlie Haughey, who was then Ireland's Minister of Justice. I like to imagine he went to his grave with my bruises on his hands after he tried to grope me during the 1969 Irish elections.</p> <p><strong>EW:</strong> What year was it when Tom Jones chased you around during an interview? That's the other side of it, as it's rather flattering sometimes.</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> It was the late 1960s, I think. I saw him at the airport recently, he looked rather good. Not-very-well-dyed hair, but&#xa0;otherwise OK. He said [after the interview]: \"I'm going on to have a drink&#xa0;at Hugh Hefner's house, do you want to come?\" and I said, \"You bet I&#xa0;do.\" He was charming. He wasn't predatory at all. But if anything had happened and he'd been less of a gentleman, I assure you, I would have thought it was my own fault. Power and&#xa0;fame are very seductive \u2013 they were then and they are now.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Laughland:</strong> But Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig were women at the top of their profession, and have made allegations about being molested live on air. It happened at roughly the same time you were at the BBC. Are you shocked?</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> It's not something I came into contact with. And if I had, I just wouldn't have put up with it. But that's me. The conspiracy of silence at Stoke Mandeville is far more distressing than the fact that Liz Kershaw didn't have the sense to say \"Stop\" when someone groped her in a BBC studio. What disappoints me now is&#xa0;that girls leave school and university with decent brains and qualifications, but at no point along the line has anyone taught them a few tricks of the trade, whether it's negotiating a salary or how to deal with a predatory male.</p> <p><strong>OL: </strong>Were you taught these things by your mum, Emma?</p> <p><strong>EW:</strong> Mum didn't need to because she very cleverly married a Glaswegian man. We used to have his old boxing gloves, and I was taught from a very young age to have a good right hook.</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> But Emma, that's your father's dramatic instructions. In fact, what women need to learn is to give over a message of: \"Don't mess with me.\" I still think it's difficult, particularly in this job market, if you've got a boss who's behaving inappropriately, and your job depends upon it. It doesn't matter how much legislation there is, if they've got the power over you and your career depends on it, you are in a very difficult situation. I remember having just had an interview for a news reporter's job on the Sunday Times. It was 1969. I then went off on a foreign trip, and another senior Sunday Times journalist who was also on the trip, and had a stake in my future, made a pass at me. And I thought: \"Oh golly what am I going to do?\" I want that job, I&#xa0;don't want to upset this person. It was difficult to deal with.</p> <p><strong>EW:</strong> That hasn't changed. The bottom line is women are far more concerned about offending someone because that will bring more problems. I like your advice about having a sticky note on the phone, saying: \"Lunches are better for me.\" There are those people you don't have dinner with \u2013 the same sort who are not safe in taxis \u2013 not safe for dinners. I&#xa0;remember working in LA as a runner, I&#xa0;was 20 maybe. The assistant director was a big shot \u2013 it's always the alphas who are trying it on. He asked me out. My roommates all giggled because he turned up in a Porsche, and maybe alarm bell number one was the car. But alarm bell number two was when I sat down he put his hand on the seat, so that I sat on it. That was a while ago, and&#xa0;I think it could still happen today.</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> I remember David Bailey took my photo a few years ago, and I asked him what the difference was between taking a&#xa0;photo now and in the 1960s, and he said: \"Well in the 60s I would have had you first!\"</p> <p><strong>OL: </strong>What would your advice be to young women trying to get into this industry?</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> Be smart. Be clever and learn. It's the same advice I would have given 20 or 30 years ago. I had the advantage of being brought up by a mother who rightly or wrongly guided me that most&#xa0;men were pretty stupid. I think it probably gave me a sense of self and self-protection that has been very useful, and I possibly have had less nasty moments than a lot of other women. I just wish women had more inbuilt confidence, I wish that more mentors of my age would persuade them to handle themselves better.</p> <p><strong>EW:</strong> Don't do anything you wouldn't want to tell your mum about later.</p> <p><strong>OL: </strong>What are your expectations of how this will affect the BBC and the results of&#xa0;the inquiry they've pledged?</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> The BBC will put out another 10 yards of guidelines and lots of producers who should be busy making television programmes will have to go to meetings to learn about them. In fact, by the time I walk into the BBC next Wednesday there'll probably be 25 new ones. The gorgeous runner I've got at the moment probably won't be able to step over the door of my dressing room. I know that's a very pragmatic view, but a BBC inquiry ain't going to solve the problem. I would much rather we cut to the chase and empowered women not to put up with this sort of behaviour.</p>",

  "<p>I spent an hour or so with Tom Wood this week as he oversaw the hanging of his new exhibition, <a href=\"http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/men-women-2\" title=\"\">Men and Women, at the Photographers' Gallery</a>. Unbelievably, it is his first major British show. It spans over 40 years and contains tantalising glimpses of several bigger series, including his photographs of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=124-c12&amp;cid=0#0\" title=\"\">Cammel Laird shipyard in Liverpool taken over three years</a> (1993\u20131996) and his epic project shooting outside Liverpool and Everton football grounds every Saturday for 20 years. Wood is both an obsessive and a maverick and, though often described reductively as a street photographer, his work does not sit easily in any tradition.</p> <p>The New Yorker's photography critic, Vince Aletti, once memorably described Wood's style as \"loose, instinctive and dead-on\" adding \"he makes Martin Parr look like a formalist\". That just about nails it. At first glance, the photographs in Men and Women look like a mishmash of styles and approaches, with what look like snapshots interspersed with more straightforward portraits, often in black and white. (Wood is a pioneering colourist, a self-taught photographer who trained as a conceptual painter at Leicester Polytechnic from 1973 to 1976.) On closer inspection, though, you see the unerring eye of a photographer for whom there are no rules.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397904659\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/10/12/1350043377729/Tom-Wood-Three-Wise-Women-010.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Wood, Three Wise Women, 1989 \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Wood, Three Wise Women, 1989. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and The Photographers' Gallery, London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Wood/Courtesy of the artist and The Photographers' Gallery, \rLondon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"I'm just interested in good photographs,\" he says, shrugging. \"I'm not a documentarist. I'm not trying to document anything. It's more about deciphering and transforming. I make what you might call real-life photographs.\" In an age of detachment, Wood still prefers to get close to his subjects. His best-known book is entitled <a href=\"http://www.steidlville.com/books/52-Photie-Man.html\" title=\"\">Photie Man</a>, a term bestowed on him by the kids on the streets of New Brighton, across the river from Liverpool, where he also photographed incessantly.</p> <p>This lack of detachment is the key to Wood's peculiar style. When he talks about individual photographs, he homes in on tiny details that one often does not register: the clenched fist of an edgy-looking lad in a passing group of football fans; the barely apparent writing on a girl's bag; the way a gesture in one image echoes a similar gesture in another. For all that, he seems oddly unconcerned by how the work is hung, leaving it to the curator, though he returns more than once to a group of rejected photographs arranged on the gallery floor. They are just as intriguing as the ones that have made it on to the walls, but there is simply not enough room here to contain the breadth and depth of his restless, relentless vision, which is a shame.</p> <p>In vitrines, there are photographs and book layouts from his more well-known works: <a href=\"http://we-english.co.uk/blog/?p=2604\" title=\"\">Looking for Love</a>, an intimately revealing book of social observation about the Chelsea Reach pub in Chelsea where he photographed between 1982 and 1985 and <a href=\"http://www.photobookstore.co.uk/photobook-all-zones-off-peak.html\" title=\"\">All Zones Off Peak</a>, which records his 18 years travelling on Liverpool buses and shooting passersby through the window. (For that project, he amassed around 100,000 negatives.) He points out a bunch of small prints from Looking for Love that were commercially processed in a high street print shop, then points out the beautifully faded Kodachrome-like colours on another framed print of two girls by a river. \"That's not faded at all,\" he says, \"that's the way they came out because they were shot on cheapo Italian film.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397904660\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/10/12/1350043481639/Tom-Wood-Mrs-Coulson-1973-010.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Wood, Mrs Coulson, 1973\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Wood, Mrs Coulson, 1973.

I love it so I put it in there.\"</p> <p>There is something palpably restless about Tom Wood, both in the flesh and in his photographs. He seems eager to somehow transform the everyday and all its small, revealing details. It's a democratic gaze and one that, as this long overdue show highlights, repays close attention. \"I think of a photograph as a receiver of sensations,\" he once said. \"Sensations are intangible. I try to organise them though the act of photography.\"</p> <h2>Now see this</h2> <p>Also at the Photographers' Gallery an intriguing show entitled Shoot! Existential Photography, which features vernacular photography centred around the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/gallery/2012/oct/11/shoot-existential-photography-in-pictures\">postwar phenomenon of the funfair shooting gallery</a> \u2013 you aimed at the bullseye and if you hit it, it <a href=\"http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/existential-photography\" title=\"\">triggered a camera which took your snapshot</a>.</p> <p>At the Towner Gallery in Eastbourne, the artist and folklore archivist, Simon Costin, has curated a group show, Collective Observations: Folklore and Photography from Benjaimin Stone to Flickr, featuring work from Faye Claridge and Doc Rowe as well as selections from the Benjamin Stone archive. On Saturday 20 October, <a href=\"http://www.homersykes.com/\" title=\"\">Homer Sykes</a> will be <a href=\"http://www.townereastbourne.org.uk/\" title=\"\">giving a talk about his work as a visual documenter of Britain's folk traditions</a>.</p> <p>At the Saatchi Gallery, the <a href=\"http://www.prixpictet.com/events/finalists-exhibition-saatchi/\" title=\"\">shortlist for the 2012 Prix Pictet is on display</a>, featuring powerful work on the theme of power from, among others, Robert Adams, Edmund Clark and the winner, Luc Delahaye.</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday a group of squatters occupying the empty BT offices in central London's Holborn were ordered to leave those premises by Master Yoxall sitting in the high court. The BT offices are commercial premises, and so fall outside the scope of recent legislation criminalising squatting in residential premises, for which the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/first-squatter-jailed-new-law\" title=\"\">first prosecution</a> was brought recently against Alex Haigh. Commercial squatting therefore remains within the remit of civil, rather than criminal, law.</p> <p>Commercial property owners may be concerned that their land will be targeted now that squatting in residential property is a crime. Of course, commercial property can range from a corner shop to a multinational bank. The only recourse for a commercial owner is to go to court and obtain a possession order. Although the procedure is relatively straightforward, the cost of simply issuing an application is \u00a3175. If owners instruct a lawyer, their costs will further increase.</p> <p>The new law differentiating commercial and residential property could be justified from a rights based perspective. Hegel, the legal philosopher, argues property is an extension of personality, and so it follows that the right to property with regard to a home, for example, deserves more protection than the same right over commercial premises.</p> <p>Squatting originates from the days where land ownership records were not kept. Occupation of land was therefore the best indication of who owned it. The same reasoning applies to \"adverse possession\" whereby, until 2002, one could become the owner of land they had been in possession of and maintained for 12 years. With the existence of the Land Registry, the days of unrecorded ownership are long gone but the question that remains is whether squatting is a social utility, or whether it has become a social nuisance.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/28/ubs-squatters-eviction-adjournment\" title=\"\">UBS occupiers</a> argued that their occupation allowed them to best exercise their freedom of speech. Of course, freedom of speech means nothing without having somewhere from which people can express themselves.</p> <p>But in <a href=\"http://sim.law.uu.nl/sim/caselaw/Hof.nsf/233813e697620022c1256864005232b7/8c78b7abee37600841256d20004cfb51?OpenDocument\" title=\"\">Appleby v UK</a>, the European court of human rights ruled that a state would not be in breach of an individual's freedom of speech where there were other reasonable forums available.</p> <p>The other consideration is the UK's huge housing problem. There are 20,000 squatters in the UK, and the Squatters' Action for Secure Homes claim there are 930 000 properties sitting empty (including residential). What is reported in the press is therefore the \"tip of the iceberg\", as the vast majority of squatters occupy peacefully, in disused warehouses for example. To criminalise squatting in commercial premises may leave many needlessly homeless.</p> <p>Land by nature is limited and so in many ways is considered a community asset. There are limits on what can be done with property that is \"owned\" \u2013 requiring of planning permission to build is an obvious example. A commercial property owner, it could be argued, should therefore be responsible for checking on it and putting it to good use. Vacant or disused properties become justifications in themselves for squatting. Ultimately, if the owner needs to assert their ownership then the court process is always available, which BT is now using.</p> <p>Already Tracey Crouch, Conservate MP for Chatham and Aylesford, has set up a campaign to extend the criminalisation of squatting to commercial premises, and no doubt such a move will continue to have wide support from commercial property owners. The squatting debate is not over.</p>",
  "<p>Merger talks between defence industry giants BAE Systems and EADS may have collapsed. But the disturbing realities of the global arms trade mean it would always have been a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/angela-merkel-bae-eads-merger-german?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">difficult deal to close</a>.</p> <p>A large part of the reason for this is the extremely close and complex relationships weapons manufacturers, perhaps more than in any other sector, have with their governments and intelligence agencies. This is a consequence of their role in foreign policy, national security and their ability to collect intelligence wherever they operate. They often have close links to political parties too, especially in Germany, as a result of their generous donations. These roles afford them proximity to those at the apex of power. Relationships are reinforced by the revolving door for personnel between corporations and government.</p> <p>As a result, defence companies are insulated from the cold winds of market competition. We can see this not only in the extent of subsidies doled out to the industry globally, but also in the fact that most arms companies fail miserably when attempting to operate outside the confines of multibillion-pound state contracts with guaranteed profits. And in an industry that accounts for about 40% of all corruption in world trade, defence companies are often protected from the full legal consequences of their sometimes nefarious actions by their home governments.</p> <p>BAE was spared the massive legal fallout from paying about \u00a36bn in \"commissions\" on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/07/bae15\" title=\"\">al-Yamamah deal</a> with Saudi Arabia by the direct personal intervention of Tony Blair in the dying days of his premiership. The company was then fined a derisory \u00a3500,000 for \"accounting irregularities\" on one transaction, in return for which the Serious Fraud Office dropped advanced investigations into corruption in five highly controversial arms deals.</p> <p>EADS has also faced its share of corruption investigations. An EADS subsidiary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/16/serious-fraud-office-arms-trade\" title=\"\">GPT Special Projects</a>, is alleged to have made \u00a314.5m in suspicious payments to two Cayman Islands-based entities as part of a \u00a32bn military communications contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia. The recipients received 14% of the equipment budget on the contract, yet appear to have provided no equipment or services.</p> <p>Had the merger talks between BAE and EADS continued it would have been interesting to see how BAE approached these allegations. The company's settlement with US authorities means it is obliged to hand over to the US department of justice any information that it comes across relating to possible corruption. BAE could hardly have undertaken meaningful due diligence without being made aware of details of the GPT case.</p> <p>This conundrum illustrates the complexities of the merger. German, British and, to a lesser extent, French and Spanish law enforcement authorities would have had to co-operate in unprecedented ways to protect the merged entity along the lines currently enjoyed by the constituent companies. State support in the form of research and development grants, financial protection and other subsidies would have been a nightmare to agree and manage.</p> <p>The failure of the merger has probably saved many hours of Anglo-German wrangling over political, economic and law enforcement issues. But there remains an urgent need to impose greater transparency on the relationship between governments and their arms companies, and for those companies to face the judicial consequences of their malfeasance. Unless governments take meaningful action, this industry that counts its profits in billions and its cost in human lives will continue to make the world a poorer place, a less democratic place, a more corrupt place and arguably a more dangerous place.</p>",

  "<p>Women allegedly sexually abused by Jimmy Savile at the BBC and Stoke Mandeville hospital are preparing to launch legal actions against both institutions seeking compensation for the psychological damage caused.</p> <p>Liz Dux, a personal injury lawyer who has acted for people with severe spinal injuries and amputees, has been contacted by several woman who want to sue over the Savile allegations.</p> <p>She is preparing cases against the BBC and the hospital on the grounds that they both have a duty of care to anyone who came into contact with their staff or agents.</p> <p>\"The case would be against the BBC or the hospital because they would be held vicariously liable in law on behalf of someone like Savile who was acting as their agent,\" Dux told BBC Radio 4's World at One on Friday.</p> <p>\"So in the case of the BBC where he abused people through his connection with programmes, for example the case about the girl who alleges she was abused in his changing room, then because of the close connection with the BBC, the BBC would be what we call vicariously liable in those circumstances,\" she added.</p> <p>\"Likewise in the hospitals. He may not have been paid by the hospital but he's there as their agent, then they owe a duty of care to those he abused.\"</p> <p>Dux said the duty of care towards patients or guests of Top of the Pops, Jim'll Fix It other programmes would be \"heightened\" if any managers had suspicions at the time about Savile.</p> <p>The threat of legal action will now increase the pressure on the BBC and the police to establish who knew what, when and why rumours of his interest in young women were not acted upon.</p> <p>Dux said the fact that some of the alleged incidents happened decades ago was not an issue. \"By their nature, abuse cases are often historic. They are often very old by the time cases are brought. People feel great shame and psychologically don't feel able to talk about it for some time,\" she told World at One. \"Quite often the courts will apply their discretion to allow these cases. For example sex abuse cases against the Catholic church or against schools or the children's homes cases in Jersey.\"</p> <p>The cases will rest on people coming forward and corroborating testimonies, but Dux said she believed they have a good prospect of succeeding.</p> <p>\"The stories I have been told so far are all very similar sounding so they sound very credible and a lot of them have been backed up by witnesses. I would say these cases have good prospects of succeeding,\" she added.</p> <p>\"They want some form of recognition as to what's happened to them in the past. They want to be taken seriously, they are not interested in the financial compensation at all, they just want the cathartic process of telling someone what they have been through and someone believing them for a change.\"</p> <p>She said compensation could range from a few thousand pounds for someone who suffered a minor assault and got on with their lives to hundreds of thousands if their lives had been wrecked, for instance if they had been unable to have a career or form relationships.</p> <p>Dux has successfully acted for victims of sexual abuse and assault at St Paul's Cathedral Choir school and told the Guardian that the women who have come to her regarding the Savile allegations have not yet had their stories told in public.</p> <p>She said it was not necessary to prove managers at the BBC or Stoke Mandeville knew what was going on to pursue an action of vicarious liability against each organisation. Normally there is a cut off for legal action taken on these grounds of three years after the victim has reached the age of 18 but child abuse cases are exceptional and are allowed to be pursued years beyond this.</p> <p>\"To win the case against the BBC you do not have to show they knew about it, provided you can prove Savile was acting as an agent of the BBC,\" said Dux.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>It has \u2013 yet again \u2013 been a peculiar week to follow the England football team. At least it has for anyone who has yet to lobotomise fully from their medium-term memory the recent bad times, chiefly the final hour of the most recent tournament appearance,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/24/euro-2012-england-italy-quarter-final\" title=\"\"> against Italy in Kiev</a>, when England looked not just ragged, but strangely traumatised, the players trotting about wearing the crumpled, stoic expressions of men who have been taken hostage and forced to perform some ritual task of abasement for the cameras: baffled, fearful, but still somehow hearteningly game and willing, like a group of dogs coerced, aggressively, into trying to play chess.</p> <p>This time, however, things are different. England entered the current double-header buoyed by images of St George's Park, the Football Association's centre of alleged excellence, which is apparently poised to change the apparent culture of elite English football apparently for good, at least if we are to believe the breathless pre-failure publicity of its inauguration this week.</p> <p>Is it just me? Looking from one to the other \u2013 the retreat from Kiev, faces smudged with ancestral confusion; to the Jacuzzis of Burton-on-Trent, the scented brochures of project-delivery \u2013 it is still hard to see how one actually speaks to the other. Other than perhaps, as a grand scale example of structural dissonance, of organisational wish-fulfilment, perhaps, even, of bullshit.</p> <p>Sorry. I know people have been very nice about all this so far. They've been nice because the FA has good intentions and is also limited by circumstance to scuttling about on the periphery, like a mother in law at Christmas fussicking impotently over the sprouts. But the fact remains, as a cure for English football's ingrained ills the Snazzadrome at St George's brings to mind a fat man deciding to lose weight by buying himself a really expensive tracksuit.</p> <p>It is as though the FA has decided to learn to speak fluent Italian by drinking a very small cup of coffee, wearing its sunglasses on the top of its head and driving around on a moped late at night shouting. It is a basic confusion of cause and effect, an apparently genuine conviction that what has been holding England back all these years is the failure to build its own luxury hotel, a lack of fancy exercise bikes and above all the absence of an altitude chamber capable of mimicking the two-yearly surprise \u2013 the outrage \u2013 of foreign-style weather.</p> <p>There is an almost endearing degree of literal-mindedness to what is largely a process of styling. Because, in isolation, there is no obvious causal link between English football's new country pile and the prospect of teenage footballers being coached more effectively around the country. The FA has tried to hurl a grappling hook across the divide. At St George's Park we will coach the coaches, sending them out pre-evangelised, rolling their eyes and hurling their arms out, ready to spread the gospel of whatever-it-is through bolted doors, over padlocked academy gates, in through the youth club keyhole.</p> <p>At which point it becomes necessary to ask the real question: what exactly are they going to be coaching up there anyway? Because, \u00a3105m spend notwithstanding, this is what is missing. It is still the great, gaping, unanswered question of post-war English football: a sense \u2013 beyond the commendable how-to of current FA coaching manuals \u2013 of what the English style, the English vision, is going to be. There is a Spanish style. There is a Dutch style. In Lviv this summer Joachim L\u00f6w discoursed with some brio on his philosophy of a new German game of sprints, a kind of bleep-test-football based around short bursts of motion. A little pretentious, perhaps a little incoherent, but this kind of talk is necessary. It offers an armature around which systems can be stretched, it feeds the imagination and it becomes even seductively self-fulfilling.</p> <p>By contrast 60 years on from the FA's first attempts to whittle out some kind of post street-football form of coaching and playing, the only coherent methodology English game has produced is the garden-shed bad science of direct football, a movement that, in Brian Glanville's words, \"poisoned the wells for a generation\". And so the FA knows what it doesn't want. It doesn't want men on park touchlines shouting \"send it\", albeit these days men don't really shout \"send it\" any more. They shout \"sustain!\" and \"use the space\" or even \"calm! CALM! CALM!\", which is good advice and shows they've been keeping up and listening to Ruud Gullit's stool-bound ruminations on Champions League nights, but does tend to make everybody feel quite tense.</p> <p>In this same spirit the FA's approach seems to have been simply to copy whatever is working elsewhere. First France's Clarefontaine Academy, when that was the thing. And now apparently Barcelona, albeit this is currently restricted to occasional swooning reminders that many of the high-tech machines present are also \"used by Lionel Messi\" \u2013 as though the FA genuinely believes Barcelona have evolved into an ideologically driven regional super-club because they have very fancy machines, a bit like convincing yourself if you could just get hold of one of those robot voice boxes and a wheelchair then you might finally start to understand astrophysics.</p> <p>Beyond which there is no real vision, no holy text, no castle in the sky. Perhaps the FA would have been better off spending its cash on bribing the planning inspectorate to obstruct the sale of playing fields while paying Johan Cruyff, Gary Neville, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Glenn Hoddle and the ghost of Jimmy Hogan to spend a long vacation shacked up in the basement of a derelict chateau imbibing opiates, smoking unfiltered cigarettes and producing on a stack of parchment a manifesto detailing once and for all exactly what English-style football is supposed to look like from here on in.</p> <p>Instead the FA chairman David Bernstein spoke, hopefully, of \"an Oxbridge of football\", at which point you could almost hear the tuts, glimpse the covert wanker signs, the rolled eyes, the sense of how much English football hates this kind of talk. And so we have hydraulic treadmills and a world-class banqueting suite and an Oxbridge of football for people who will remain ill-qualified to go to an Oxbridge of football: an Oxbridge in isolation while all around it the sands stretch away, patrolled by the FA's own distant platoons of prosthelytising converts, rapping at the shuttered city gates with their pamphlets, their medium to long term good intentions.</p> <p>Perhaps it would have been better if the FA lets up on all the development talk and simply said: We have built ourselves a fancy HQ with a luxury hotel, partly in the hope players will no longer see us as cobwebbed second-raters by comparison with their clubs (who will, let's face it, always have the first and last word in the wrangle of competing interests over academies and coaching). For now at least this England team can get on with presenting itself to the world, laid out in its splendid new-build sarcophagus, shaved and barbered, newly suited, eyes glazed with entropic reverie.</p>",
  "<p>\"Super-selectivity\" is the kind of concocted word beloved of politicians and policy wonks. I hadn't heard it until a couple of weeks ago when Rob Whiteman, chief executive of the UK Border Agency (UKBA), used it to describe the government's immigration policy at the <a href=\"http://www.detentionadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Detention Advice Service</a>'s 20th anniversary conference.</p> <p>Whiteman argued that, within this newly labelled policy, foreign national prisoners were regarded as a specific category of people who really, really should be deported \u2013 presumably, super-super-selectivity. He was referencing a speech earlier this year by then immigration minister Damian Greene to the Conservative think-tank Policy Exchange when the minister talked of super-selectivity or (in the alternative) \"double-plus selectivity\" (yes, <a href=\"http://www.migrantsrights.org.uk/blog/2012/02/mr-green-s-speech-points-double-plus-selectivity\" title=\"\">seriously</a>).</p> <p>In the context of the 10,861 foreign nationals in our prisons, \"super-selectivity\" means one thing: \"you're not staying here\". Such blanket judgments \u2013 treating a class of people as \"a homogenous mass\" as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/julietlyon\" title=\"\">Juliet Lyon</a>, director of the Prison Reform Trust, neatly put it at the conference \u2013 need to be challenged.</p> <p>The notion that the European Convention on Human Rights is routinely abused in defence of foreign nationals also needs to be challenged. \"It's shameful that child killers and rapists can abuse human rights laws to escape deportation,\" <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9566479/177-foreign-criminals-avoid-deportation-on-family-rights-grounds.html\" title=\"\">said Charlie Elphicke</a>, the Conservative MP for Dover &amp; Deal recently. \"What about the right to family life of the families they have destroyed?\"</p> <p>Foreign national prisoners achieved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/21/foreign-national-prisoners-new-pariahs\" title=\"\">pariah status</a> following the \"crisis of 2006 when it was revealed that more than 1,013 were released without being considered for deportation \u2013 an issue so toxic that it led to the swift departure of Charles Clark as home secretary.</p> <p>According to the Prison Reform Trust, foreign national prisoners in UK prisons come from 156 countries and over half are from 10 (Jamaica, Poland, Ireland, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Lithuania, India, Vietnam and Somalia). They aren't all child killers and rapists, nor are all of them violent \u2013 46% of foreign national women are inside for drug offences (compared to 21% of British nationals) and 16% for fraud and forgery offences. According to the female prison welfare project Hibiscus, half of foreign national women have children under the age of 18.</p> <p>The total number of foreign nationals in our prison nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010 \u2014 compared to a 20% increase in British nationals. In 2009, some 11,268 untried foreign nationals went into custody \u2013 that's a staggering 136% increase since 1999 (by contrast there has been a 28% decrease in terms of untried receptions of British nationals).</p> <p>Foreign prisoners are also treated differently \u2013 or at least strongly feel that they are. At the DAS conference, Martin Kettle, policy lead on foreign national prisoners at the HM Inspectorate of Prisons, went through the results of a survey of 5,352 British national and 750 foreign national prisoners on perceptions of life in prisons. Apparently, 81% of British national prisoners knew where they were going when they were coming to a prison compared to 66% of foreign nationals; 75% of British nationals felt safe on their first night compared to 69% of foreign nationals; and 17% of British nationals as against 22% of foreign nationals felt unsafe at that point in time.</p> <p>Kettle spoke of the 'damage of uncertainty': \"If you walk into an immigration removal centre you can feel it in the air.\"</p> <p>The immigration regime was tightened in July specifically to prevent the abuse of article 8 rights \u2013 the new rules state that it will only be \"in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation is outweighed\". A report by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration last November found that between February 2010 and January 2011 about a third of appeals lodged by foreign national prisoners against the decision to deport was successful (425 in total) \u2014 primarily on article 8 grounds. In the same year, <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/articlesAndTranscripts/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf\" title=\"\">5,235 foreign national prisoners were deported</a> from the UK.</p> <p>As of April next year and the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/legislation/bills-and-acts/acts/legal-aid-and-sentencing-act/laspo-background-information\" title=\"\">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act</a>, it will be impossible for foreign national prisoners who wish to challenge deportation proceedings to get legal advice from a solicitor unless they are able to pay for it themselves. \"It is not right to subject someone to a serious sanction of deportation without giving them the means to understand the situation and to assert the rights provided for them by law,\" commented DAS director Nigel Caleb. Quite. By the way, all deportations papers served by the UKBA are written entirely in English.</p> <p>The 2006 crisis led directly to the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/30/contents\" title=\"\">UK Borders Act 2007</a> with a new regime of automatic deportation for any non-EEA national (including those granted indefinite leave) who gets a custodial sentence of 12 months or more. So rather than the facts of individual case determining a decision to deport, it is the length of prison sentence.</p> <p>The so-called crisis has also fundamentally changed the attitude of the Home Office staff from senior managers to caseworkers, Steve Symonds of the <a href=\"http://www.ilpa.org.uk\" title=\"\">Immigration Law Practitioners' Association</a> told delegates at the DAS event. According to Symonds, in nine out of 10 cases where detainees are released, they are released as a result of the decision of a court. \"That is obviously because the UKBA and its casework staff cannot countenance the idea that they release someone,\" he said.</p> <p>Symonds made the case for scrapping the automatic deportation provisions. He called it \"a stupid policy position which does not give any more power to deport anybody, but which prevents sensible consideration of the circumstances of every individual rather than just the homogenous mass\".</p> <p>It is a proposal that is hard to disagree with, bit it won't be introduced until more enlightened times.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/09/efficiency-savings-school-teachers\" title=\"\">The latest contribution </a>to the education reform agenda from the thinktank Reform appears to suggest that the most effective way for schools to save money is by changing teachers' pay and conditions.</p> <p>All this is, of course, done in the name of efficiency. Reform suggests that, as 70% (their figure, not mine) of school spending goes towards paying for teachers, we should find ways of reducing this. Lauren Thorpe, a former head of department at a state secondary school, makes several points to back up the recommendations. As someone who is still a head of department at a state secondary school, I'm going to attempt to bring some reality to this academic thinking.</p> <h2>\"Economies of scale can be achieved through increasing class sizes, as in South Korea\" </h2> <p>What this doesn't say is that in South Korea, teachers spend, on average, 10-15 hours a week in the classroom. In Britain, we teach 20-30 hours a week. This means that South Korean teachers have more time to plan lessons, prepare work, assess learning and tailor the curriculum around the individual needs of their students. Schools still pay the same for the teachers, but allow them more time to do their jobs properly \u2013 and, presumably, employ enough of them to cover the hours that the students are in school adequately. In short, they may have larger class sizes but, as a consequence, each teacher has more time to deal with them.</p> <h2>\"It is widely agreed that the Building Schools for the Future programme should not, in hindsight, have happened\"</h2> <p>Reform argues that the average cost of \u00a32,500 per square metre was too much for the public purse to handle and that the new figure of \u00a31,100, achieved largely through using prefab designs, is better. Well, yes it is, but the latest prefab designs are for schools that are significantly smaller. Smaller corridors, halls, playgrounds and, most importantly, classrooms. Well, if you want larger class sizes, you're going to need larger classrooms \u2013 and larger classrooms cost more.</p> <h2>\"Real value for money should be sought in schools' most expensive resource and most valuable asset \u2013 teachers\"</h2> <p>I assume this means that we should either have fewer teachers, who teach larger classes, or pay existing teachers less. In my opinion, we need more teachers in schools, not fewer. However, if we're going to follow the South Korean model then we should follow the whole model, which means giving teachers the additional time it takes to plan lessons, assess work and create a personalised curriculum.</p> <h2>\"Teachers should go the extra mile\"</h2> <p>In September, in my piece on the <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Guardian Teacher Network</a>, I acknowledged that there are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/2012/sep/27/teachers-leave-school-not-lazy\" title=\"\">some teachers who don't go the extra mile</a>. Most, however, are going the extra mile just to keep their heads above the water. This makes the idea of performance-related pay even more farcical. How do school leaders judge a teacher's performance? There are so many factors outside a teacher's control that make this suggestion absurd. Attempting to do so on the basis of results, for instance, is difficult enough within the same school, let alone across regions or the whole country.S chools would end up having to pay out for consultants \u2013 any savings would be minimal.</p> <p>For sensible, un-politically motivated, recommendations, thinktanks should ask teachers themselves \u2013 they might get some worthwhile insights.</p> <p>For instance, a teacher might suggest that we need to spend more money on employing staff. Instead of spending 70% of the school budget on staff, we should increase that figure to nearer 90%. By employing more teachers or support staff we could ease the burden across a larger pool, freeing teachers up to use their time more effectively \u2013 and more effective teaching can have only a positive affect on student outcomes.</p> <p>Another recommendation could be to focus our attention on staff wellbeing. When staff leave, it costs a good deal to replace them \u2013 the costs can be well over \u00a31,000. If we spent more time on retaining quality staff by treating them better or looking after them more, there would be an instant saving.</p> <p>Sadly, instead, we teachers get the same old treatment. Reform seems to be starting with the incorrect assertion that teachers are the problem; instead, the proposition should start the other way round: teachers are the solution.</p> <p><em>Mike Britland is head of ICT at a comprehensive school in Bournemouth.

It's a big game, with 2GB of free space required for the install \u2013&nbsp;but the sumptuous graphics are worth the download wait. Online deathmatching and capture-the-flag modes are also included.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/real-football-2013/id533391318?mt=8\">Real Football 2013</a></h2> <p>Hot on the heels of FIFA 2013's App Store release comes Gameloft's Real Football 2013, with its own FIFPro licence for player names and likenesses, and an emphasis on developing your club, stadium and commercial businesses alongside a winning team. That's in the context of a freemium game, so it's free to download and play, but you pay for virtual cash using varying quantities of real money, from \u00a31.49 up to \u00a369.99.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftF3HM\">NFL Pro 2013</a></h2> <p>And another Gameloft sports game for good measure, this time covering the other kind of football, with helmets and touchdowns and dodgy refs. We're not sure if the latter make it in here, but the game itself \u2013&nbsp;another free-to-play title \u2013&nbsp;has crossed from iOS to Android. It's got an official NFL licence, and similar features for developing the infrastructure around your team.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/babel-rising-3d/06f630ae-b19a-49cd-91ff-4b08d6183cf4\">Babel Rising 3D</a></h2> <p>The latest Xbox-branded game for Windows Phone comes from Ubisoft, and sees you in the shoes of a \"great, almighty, and very angry deity\" picking on a tribe of humans to ensure they don't get the Tower of Babel built. An interesting spin on the god-game genre.<br><strong>Windows Phone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kumo-lumo/id551319982?mt=8\">Kumo Lumo</a></h2> <p>Forget taking it to the cloud, as Microsoft might say. In this game, you ARE the cloud, floating above a virtual world raining on forests and poleaxing enemies with lightning bolts. The visual style is strong and original, and it's a free-to-play game \u2013&nbsp;in-app purchases are used to boost your prospects with virtual gold purchases.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/topia-world-builder/id534282109?mt=8\">Topia World Builder</a></h2> <p>There's a lot of buzz around Topia World Builder because of the involvement of Glenn Corpes, one of legendary god-game Populous' co-creators. This takes some of that series' ideas and applies them to touchscreen gaming, as you shape a virtual world with your fingers, spawning animals and tweaking the landscape as you please.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/super-bunny-breakout/id560556342?mt=8\">Super Bunny Breakout</a></h2> <p>Atari and Zynga, together at last? It's a meeting of minds that has surprised plenty of people, but the results look like they may be fun. This is a 2012 update on the Breakout brick-busting formula, except with a plot involving a team of rabbits trying to break out of an \"Evil Animal Testing\" lab. 40 levels and plenty of power-ups ensure it feels modern rather than retro.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.plagueinc\">Plague Inc</a></h2> <p>Two days after launching, Plague Inc has already zoomed past 100k downloads on the Google Play store, albeit as a free download. It's the latest game from Miniclip, and gets players to \"bring about the end of human history by evolving a deadly, global Plague whilst adapting against everything humanity can do to defend itself\". Which is cheery. An in-app purchase removes ads and unlocks bonus features.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madfingergames.deadzone\">Shadowgun: Deadzone</a></h2> <p>Polished shooter Shadowgun has spawned a new spin-off for Android, although it's in beta for the moment, and only available for devices with Tegra 3 processors (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra#Tegra_3\">this link may help</a> if you're wondering if that's true of yours). The focus here is on online deathmatching, with four playable characters, two modes and two maps.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.leagueofevil\">League of Evil</a></h2> <p>\"Flip, dash and wall-jump your way to destroying the League of Evil,\" suggests the Google Play listing for Noodlecake Studios' new game, which offers well-crafted pixel art, 160 levels and some tight controls. Oh, and lots of acrobatics, with a chiptune soundtrack. It looks as excellent as the existing iOS version.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/monopoly-millionaire/id563613222?mt=8\">Monopoly Millionaire for iPad</a></h2> <p>Monopoly has been one of the most popular mobile games since long before the app store era, but now EA has rebooted the digital version of Hasbro's board game once again. The emphasis here is on speed, as you race for a million in a board tilted towards luxury lifestyles. Multiplayer is supported on one device or via local Wi-Fi.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.chaosrings.googleplay\">Chaos Rings</a></h2> <p>Other developers will be keen to see if Square Enix can make decent money with an \u00a38.99 price on the Google Play store for its RPG, which has been ported from iOS. It sees you playing through four scenarios with a pair of characters each, with battles and plotlines in equal measure.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/world-series-of-yahtzee/id538216630?mt=8\">World Series of Yahtzee</a></h2> <p>Another revamp of a well-established board game (well, dice'n'paper game) from EA, although this one's free-to-play. Will Yahtzee fans balk at the idea of buying in-game \"stacks\" for real money? That remains to be seen, but the game itself sounds good fun, with power-ups and combos. The initial game is ad-supported, but you can pay \u00a31.49 to remove those.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad </strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.contrejour.ie/\">Contre Jour</a></h2> <p>This isn't a native app: it's an HTML5 version of existing mobile hit Contre Jour, which has been created in partnership with Microsoft for its Internet Explorer 10 browser and Windows 8 OS. That means it's good for tablets, including multi-touch controls and use of hardware acceleration. Now, all you need is a Windows 8 tablet running IE10...<br><strong>HTML5</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/girls-like-robots/id533815482?mt=8\">Girls Like Robots</a></h2> <p>\"Girls like robots. And robots like girls. Just don't surround robots with girls; it makes them freak out,\" explains the App Store listing for Adult Swim and Popcannibal's new game. Moustaches, pies and lasers also find their way into the gameplay for this tile-based puzzler, which offers 110 levels of robotic girly action.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ben-10-game-generator-3/id550715659?mt=8\">Ben 10 Game Generator 3</a></h2> <p>Ben 10 remains a popular brand among children, and the previous two Game Generator games have picked up a thriving audience. This third iteration continues the formula: 50 top-down levels filled with traps, enemies and obstacles. However, the twist is the inclusion of a level editor for children to create their own levels and share them with other players \u2013&nbsp;and download their creations too.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.thumbstar.com/games/grumble-and-piccolos-fishing-trip\">Grumble and Piccolo's Fishing Trip</a></h2> <p>There are lots of gem-swapping games available for smartphones and tablets, but how about starfish-swapping? The game focuses on a pair of Chinstrap Penguins catching fish and other sealife for their customers, with match-three gameplay boosted by canny use of power-ups. I went to a press event which included this earlier in the year, and ended up absorbed for 20 minutes, so hopefully it'll find an audience.<br><strong>Android / iOS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.glu.com/game/death-dome\">Death Dome</a></h2> <p>Modern-day app stores are pretty unhealthy places, given the number of population-ravaging viruses on the loose in mobile games. Glu's freemium Death Dome is the latest action game that sees humankind getting a bit... mutanty. Infinity Blade appears to be a big inspiration for the gameplay, with its enormous monsters to battle and skills/looting mechanic.<br><strong>Android / iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Invictus.GreedCorpMobilePaid\">Greed Corp</a></h2> <p>Greed Corp has found a popular audience on PC and console, but now it's available for Android devices too. Expect turn-based strategy in a steampunk setting, with solo and multiplayer modes, online high-score tables and 36 maps to play on.

  "<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will conduct a wide-ranging investigation into allegations of police misconduct raised by the Hillsborough independent panel report published last month. It will consider new evidence unearthed by the 395-page report and 450,000 supporting documents, and can recommend criminal charges or disciplinary action against the individuals concerned. These are the new areas that will be considered:</p> <h2>Failure to declare a major incident</h2> <p>The report showed that none of the emergency services effectively mobilised a major incident plan. One of the crucial new disclosures in the panel's report was that as many as 41 of the 96 victims of the disaster had the potential to survive beyond the 3.15pm cut-off point imposed by the coroner on the orginal inquiry. \"Therefore a causation issue may arise in realation to the emergency response, which has not been previously considered,\" the IPCC said.</p> <h2>Tunnel closure</h2> <p>The report describes overcrowding at previous semi-finals at the ground in 1981, 1987 and 1988, but says that when the pens at the Leppings Lane end were full, the tunnels leading to them were closed on the instruction of senior officers. Evidence of a failure to do so in 1989 was among the information removed from police officers' statements. Senior officers denied knowing the tunnel had been closed in previous years, but there is evidence in the report that they may have lied.</p> <h2>Changes to officers' statements</h2> <p>The report reveals that in the aftermath of the disaster, statements taken from officers to present a \"suitable case\" for the inquiries that followed were altered on the instruction of senior officers to present the police in a better light and emphasise the role of the fans. Of 164 statements which were substantially altered, 116 were changed to remove criticism of the police. \"The alleged nature of some of the amendments may amount to the criminal offences of perverting the course of justice or misconduct in public office. The deliberate alteration of statements may also raise misconduct offences in relation to honesty and integrity,\" the IPCC said. Aside from the method of taking the statements, the IPCC will also look into whether the Wain report, which was based on the statements, was biased and sought to divert criticism from South Yorkshire police. \"At its highest this could amount to perverting the course of justice, and at the least, raises questions of discreditable conduct, and honesty and integrity,\" it said.</p> <h2>Alleged misleading of media and parliament</h2> <p>The original Taylor report revealed the sensationalist reporting of the behaviour of Liverpool fans, most notoriously in the Sun's story under its front page headline \"The Truth\", to be entirely without foundation. The independent panel's report sets out in detail the attempts of various South Yorkshire police officers to undermine Taylor's conclusions and blame drunk fans for the disaster. The IPCC will investigate comments from the secretary of the police federation, Paul Middup, named in the media as the source of untrue allegations of fans' drunken behaviour. It will look into a Police Federation meeting with MP Michael Shersby to determine whether the organisation deliberately misled him, and it will investigate the source of comments to White's news agency in Sheffield, which formed the basis of the Sun's story. The police briefing given to Margaret Thatcher and the home secretary at the time , Douglas Hurd, when they visited Sheffield the day after the disaster, will also be covered.</p> <h2>The actions in the gymnasium</h2> <p>The gymnasium underneath one of the stands was used as a temporary mortuary. The IPCC look into why the coroner gave the order to check all of the victims' blood alcohol levels, and will investigate the conduct of police in allegedly carrying out national computer checks on the deceased and others. It will also look into why relatives were questioned about how much alcohol their loved ones had consumed. \"We will need to investigate whether this formed part of the attempts to gather evidence to shift the blame from South Yorkshire police, the IPCC said.</p> <h2>Potential problems with previous investigations</h2> <p>The statements taken by West Midlands police obtained no evidence that was compliant with the Criminal Justice Act, and the format caused a delay that may have led to disciplinary proceedings not taking place. The Police Complaints Authority expressed concerns in \"the strongest terms\" but had no power to act. In the meantime Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who was in overall control on the day of the match, retired on grounds of ill health. The independent panel's report also raises concerns about the conduct of Cumbria's chief constable, Leslie Sharp, who concluded an investigation into his South Yorkshire counterpart, Peter Wright, three days before Wright's planned retirement. Sharp subsquently wrote to Wright, praising him and saying that he had not wanted to conduct the investigation. The IPCC said \"these disclosures raise questions about the adequacy and thoroughness of the West Midlands police investigation and its oversight\".</p> <h2>The role of Sir Norman Bettison</h2> <p>The chief constable of West Yorkshire police, Sir Norman Bettison, was referred to the IPCC for his role in disseminating misleading information in the wake of the disaster. He was present at the Police Federation meeting with Shersby on 3 October 1989, where he showed a video compiled from 65 hours of footage from Hillsborough. He later showed the same video to a wider group of MPs. The IPCC said it was \"unwise\" for Bettison to issue a statement in the wake of the independent panel's report and \"insensitive and inappropriate\" to mention the behaviour of the fans. The IPCC received a further \"serious allegation\", which will be investigated immediately, that Bettison sought to influence the decision-making of the West Yorkshire Police Authority in regard to its initial referral of him to the IPCC. Bettison announced earlier this month that he planned to retire next March.</p> <p> </p> <h2>What happens now?</h2> <p>The IPCC will spend several months determining the size and scope of what will be the biggest investigation into the police in British history. The home secretary, Theresa May, has promised to provide the necessary manpower and resources. It will ultimately decide whether criminal charges should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service or make recommendations for disciplinary charges. It acknowledges, however, that its powers are limited where actions fall short of criminal charges and the individuals concerned have retired.</p> <p>The Director of Public Prosecutions will review the evidence with a view to bringing manslaughter charges against organisations - which could include South Yorkshire police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield City Council - or individuals. The attorney general, Dominic Grieve, must also decide whether to apply to the high court to quash the existing 96 verdicts of accidental death. He will liaise with the familiies and the CPS over when to hold any new inquest.</p>",
  "<h2>Subject: history <br>Interviewer: Stephen Tuck, Pembroke College </h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Imagine we had no records about the past at all, except everything to do with sport \u2013 how much of the past could we find out about?</p> <p><strong>Stephen:</strong> I would say this to a candidate who had mentioned an interest in sport on their personal statement, though it could equally be applied to an interest in something else \u2013 like film, drama, or music.</p> <p>What I would be looking for is to see how the candidate might use their imagination, building on something they know about (probably much more than I do) to tackle questions of historical research.</p> <p>Answers could relate to the racial/class/gender relations in society (who played the sports, and which sports, at any given time); international politics/empire (which countries were involved, did groups of countries play the same sport); economic development (the technological development of sports, how sport was watched); the values within a society (bloodthirsty sports to more genteel sports); health (participation rates); or many other issues \u2013 the list is long.</p> <p>I would usually ask supplementary questions, to push the students further \u2013 and often, I would have no answer in my mind, but would simply be interested in seeing how far the student could push their analysis.</p> <h2>Subject: English <br>Interviewer: Lucinda Rumsey, Mansfield College </h2> <p><strong>Q: </strong>JK Rowling has just published a book for adults after the hugely successful Harry Potter series. In what ways do you think that writing for children is different to writing for adults?</p> <p><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Candidates who have grown up on Harry Potter might have read Rowling's new book and have thought both about Rowling's change of audience and their own change as readers from child to adult. But even without knowing Rowling's work at all candidates could say something about themselves as readers, and how as readers they approach different kinds of books, and how writers develop a body of work and write for different audiences.</p> <p>Mainly I always want to know that whatever they are reading, candidates are reading thoughtfully and self-consciously, and are able to think as literary critics about all the books they read. I worry that not all candidates might have the same access to a wide range of literature, and I am careful to judge them on what they know, not on what they don't know.</p> <p>If I asked that question about Shakespeare some candidates might have a view of his literary output, but many wouldn't. If I start with Harry Potter, everyone at least has a starting point of recognition. And I think Rowling deserves a mention as I am sure that there are many people applying to study English at university this year who became avid readers because of her books.</p> <h2>Subject: experimental psychology <br>Interviewer: David Popplewell, Brasenose College </h2> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Why do human beings have two eyes?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> This question may result from a more general discussion about the human senses, and can develop in a number of different directions, partly depending upon the knowledge and expertise of the interviewee.</p> <p>For example, two eyes are important for three dimensional (3D) vision. Why is it that we can still see in 3D when only looking through one eye? What determines the optimum position and distance between the two eyes?</p> <p>Why is it that we see a stable view of the world even though we are constantly moving our head? How can an understanding of mathematics, physics and biology help us explain 3D vision?</p> <p>The discussion may develop in to a consideration of the different senses and the role they play in us interacting in our environment, including interacting with other people, and the nature of perceptual experience.</p> <h2>Subject: modern languages <br>Interviewer: Helen Swift, St Hilda's College</h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Should poetry be difficult to understand?</p> <p><strong>Helen:</strong> This question arose out of discussion of a few poems that a candidate said he had read, and we were talking through how these poems were conveying meaning (through things such as tone and the imagery they used).</p> <p>We wanted to push the candidate into more conceptual thinking to test his intellectual curiosity and how he would handle moving from familiar particulars (the poems he knew) to less familiar ways of approaching them.</p> <p>What's important for candidates to realise is that we don't expect a single correct answer to such a question; it's a starting point for a new direction of discussion: what sorts of \"difficulties\" might we have in mind? Are these specific to poetry or do they also feature in other types of writing? And so on.</p> <p>What most interests us is that candidates are willing to venture down a new path, however uncertain this may feel: to have a go and show that they have the potential to develop their thinking further \u2013 and thus thrive on the sort of course we offer.</p> <p>Literature forms an important part of a modern languages degree at Oxford, but we know that most candidates won't have studied literature formally before in the language for which they're applying.</p> <p>What we want to know isn't that they've read a certain number of texts to prove their interest, but that they have the aptitude for studying texts: that they're able to think carefully and imaginatively about whatever they've have chance to read (poems, prose, drama) that's interested them, in any language.</p> <h2>Subject: biological sciences <br>Interviewer: Martin Speight, St Anne's College</h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do many animals have stripes?</p> <p><strong>Martin:</strong> The main aim of the question is to get applicants to think about biological topics and put them in the context of successful adaptations to life on earth. So I might expect students to start by thinking of some stripey animals, then move on to thinking about categories of striped animals \u2013 for example those that are dangerous (such as wasps, tigers, and snakes), those that have stripes for camouflage (such as zebras but also tigers), and those whose stripes are harmless mimics of dangerous ones.</p> <p>They might think of specific examples for detailed comparison: tigers and zebras for example both have stripes for camouflage and blending in with background, one to hide from prey and the other to hide from predators.</p> <p>Other things that would be worth considering include whether stripes may only occur in the young of a species; whether the colour of the stripes matters rather than just the contrasting stripe pattern, and why do stripe size, shape, width and pattern vary in different species.</p> <p>There are no right or wrong specific answers to the questions \u2013 I'm just interested in candidates' speculations about the advantages of having stripes.</p> <h2>Subject: politics (philosophy, politics and economics)<br>Interviewer: Dave Leal, Brasenose College </h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> When I was at school in the 1970s, there was talk of a pensions crisis that would one day hit. The talk persisted in the 1980s, and the 1990s \u2013 and then there was a pensions crisis, and little had been done politically to prepare us for it.</p> <p>Is there a fault with the British political system that means we can't sensibly address serious medium and long-term problems when they are identified?</p> <p><strong>Dave:</strong> This question was an invitation to think about democracy and its limitations \u2013 it's a big question, but an important one. I have had candidates come up with good discussions about voting methods \u2013 for example, how having proportions of parliament voted in for much longer terms might promote more long-term policy thinking.</p> <p>Another approach might be to reflect on the responsibility of the electorate; if they do not think in long-term ways, it may not be politicians who are to blame, and the problem may be down to education.</p> <p>One might reflect upon the importance of having an un-elected second chamber to which all really important business could be delegated.</p> <p>One candidate suggested that no one should be allowed to stand for parliament unless they have dependent children, with the thought that this would ensure a personal motivation towards longer term thinking on a variety of matters.</p> <p>There is no single 'right answer' to the question, most answers given serve as the basis for further elaboration. For example, in the case of longer parliamentary terms: what would be the wider consequences of that change? Would they be desirable?</p> <p>We are testing the capacity to begin to locate the source of a problem, and try out solutions through discussion. The precise solution students suggest matters much less than evidence of the refining of ideas and of self-correction where necessary.</p> <p><strong> \u2022 Do you have memories of a nerve-racking university interview?

  "<p>As the recent case brought by Virgin Trains demonstrates, even the biggest and most well resourced procurement exercises can go horribly wrong. With limited resources and the increasing risk of legal challenge, procurement teams must be on their guard now more than ever to avoid the arduous, costly and wasteful consequences of lengthy legal proceedings.</p> <p>The document Public Contracts Regulations 2006 governs most of the commissioning and purchasing activities of local authorities and, even if it looks like a procurement process might sit outside the regulations, it's important not to forget internal rules and procedures governing the letting of contracts.</p> <p>There are many tensions between a regulatory regime designed to remove barriers to trade between EU states and the facets of localism. The Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, which comes into force early next year, is just one such tension.</p> <p>The act will require local authorities to consider \"how what is proposed to be procured might improve the economic, social and environmental well-being of the relevant area\". It is easy to see how well meaning procurement teams could fall foul of the regulations when taking into account a provider's claim about keeping the authority's spend within the local community. While this might be attractive, it's almost certainly a breach of the rules, and disaffected providers can \u2013 and will \u2013 seek redress in the courts.</p> <p>The courts in such cases can award damages (based on lost profits) to a successful claimant, set aside the awarded contract and fine an errant authority. Damages can only be issued in the High Court and any well advised claimant will issue in the Technology and Construction Court (TCC) where specialist judiciary sit. Of course, this means barristers in London doing a great deal of the work, which has a knock on effect in terms of high costs; our usual estimate is between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3200,000 per side, if it gets that far.</p> <p>We've seen a year on year doubling in challenges over the past four or five years, driven in part by the difficult economic climate and claimants' inability to replace lost revenue from new sources.One explanation is that service providers have typically lost out on a real income stream and as such, are immediately motivated to do something about it. If a small business is reliant on a big contract, the effect of losing can be devastating. In those circumstances, a challenge is almost inevitable.</p> <p>Around 80% of challenges are based on a few core issues, include not sharing the full facts with bidders, changing the terms of the contract and using forbidden criteria. Vague criteria such as \"tell us how you would celebrate diversity in our communities\" (a genuine example) are likely to cause major problems.</p> <p>Watch out for these common legal risk hotspots in your procurement exercises:</p> <p>\u2022 How your providers find out out about the contract in the first place.</p> <p>\u2022 Setting the criteria and the specification for the contract. Is any of the documentation likely to favour a particular provide, either in terms of their knowledge or products?</p> <p>\u2022 Interviews, which often take the form of a conversation leaving it very difficult to prove that each bidder was asked the same questions and treated equally. The risks involved here seldom outweigh the benefits.</p> <p>\u2022 Offering a debrief. You don't need to do verbal debriefs; the award decision notice is the only correspondence you are obliged to enter into with losing bidders.</p> <p>Nevetheless, local authorities can take comfort in the fact that most claims start from a form of the argument \"my widgets are better than theirs\". Frankly, courts aren't interested in the technical merits of one solution over another (so long as they both meet the specification) and buyers still retain a degree of discretion when comparing the merits of one solution over another.</p> <p>Remember, too, that no bidder likes to rock the boat while they still think they're in with a chance of boarding it. Action taking under these regulations must be brought within 30 days of the date the claimant knew or ought to have known of the authority's breach, except in exceptional circumstances. Given the long timescales of most procurement exercises, this can mean that many promising cases are lost because they are challenged out of time.</p> <p>Ultimately, even if a local authority may have breached the regulations, unless that breach would have altered the outcome of the procurement process so that a challenger would have won then a damages claim will fall at the first hurdle. This ought reassure councils, though challenges will come in the form of the Social Value Act.</p> <p><em>Martin Vincent is partner and a procurement specialist at national law firm Weightmans LLP</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>What do the Co-op, the AA, Saga, Direct Line and BT have in common? All of them are, in one way or another, looking to expand their businesses in the law sector.</p> <p>Until recently, the legal market has been bereft of brands. But no more \u2013 as in every other corner of commercial life, the big brands will not be denied. Even the best-known legal brand in the US, an online legal document service called LegalZoom, is coming over here, as is a rival US service called Rocket Lawyer that has financial backing from Google. We may not always like big brands, but that doesn't stop us using them. No wonder the <a href=\"http://www.lawsociety.org.uk\" title=\"\">Law Society</a> is currently engaged in a national advertising campaign urging the public to use their local solicitor.</p> <p>The catalyst is the introduction of alternative business structures (ABSs) under the 2007 Legal Services Act. This for the first time allows non-lawyers to own or invest in law firms, subject to regulatory approval granted by either the <a href=\"http://www.sra.org.uk\" title=\"\">Solicitors Regulation Authority </a>(SRA) or the <a href=\"http://www.conveyancer.org.uk\" title=\"\">Council for Licensed Conveyancers</a>. The latter has licensed seven ABSs since the new regime began on 6 October 2011, while the SRA has granted 29 licences since January.</p> <p>This might not seem like many \u2013 but the approval process is lengthy and there are something like 100 more applications making their way through. Of the five brands listed above, only the Co-op has an ABS licence, while Direct Line has not even submitted its application yet. It was never going to be an overnight revolution.</p> <p>There have also been many other initiatives \u2013 such as the network of law firms under the QualitySolicitors brand \u2013 structured in such a way that they do not require an ABS licence. Almost more important than ABSs themselves is the mood music they have created, encouraging innovation and change (not necessarily for the better, in the view of many lawyers). And change there has already been \u2013 many of these new entrants are shunning the idea of charging by the hour and instead instigating fixed fees, for example.</p> <p>It is not necessarily change on a grand scale. Several ABSs are actually small, traditional, law firms that simply want to bring in a non-lawyer partner \u2013 in some cases a spouse, in others a valued member of staff \u2013 but look back ten years and the notion of having a non-lawyer partner in a law firm was unthinkable.</p> <p>More eye-catching is the possibility of external investment. We have already seen a private equity firm (Duke Street) invest in a law firm (Plexus Law, part of the Parabis Group) and a listed company \u2013 in fact the world's first listed law firm, Slater &amp; Gordon, based in Australia \u2013 has bought up major UK practice Russell Jones &amp; Walker. Even James Caan, formerly a Dragon's Den investor, is putting money into a law firm in Stoke.</p> <p>Most remarkable of all was the launch of Stobart Barristers, part of the logistics company famous for its lorries, offering consumers the option of cutting out solicitors and going straight to barristers with their legal problems.</p> <p>Put it all together and actually a remarkable amount has happened in a short period of time. The pioneer of the newbies is Co-operative Legal Services, which has actually being going since 2006 and is already one of the 100 largest law firms in the UK by turnover. Earlier this year it announced plans to grow its 500-strong workforce by a further 3,000 over the next five years.</p> <p>There is panic among some lawyers at what the future holds for them. Others hold onto the belief that the personal service of a small law firm embedded in its community will trump the telephone or web-based advice of many of their new competitors. Some argue that companies with their eye constantly on the bottom line are not imbued with the professional ethos of putting the client first but whether that is actually true of all solicitors, and indeed of non-solicitors, is questionable.</p> <p>QualitySolicitors is an attempt to bridge the gap, by bringing together local law firms into what is essentially a marketing collective with the financial muscle to take out TV advertising spots. Even that has attracted the ire of other solicitors, particularly at what they see as the attempt to appropriate the notion of 'quality' legal advice.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the success of the Co-op, it is too early to tell whether the way people buy legal services is changing. ABSs are meant to stimulate competition and more consumer choice and alongside their introduction regulation of the legal profession is moving towards ensuring whoever is providing a particular service is able and competent to do so. It may be a difficult time to be a lawyer, but \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 it should be a better time to be a client.</p> <p>Neil Rose is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.legalfutures.co.uk\" title=\"\">legalfutures.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The cinematographer Harris Savides, who has died of brain cancer aged 55, brought an evocative aesthetic to films made by some of the world's most adventurous directors. His goal was to capture what he called a \"heightened reality\" through a visual style that was understated to the point of being subliminal: \"I don't think you can ever make a movie that looks amazing when you're trying to make it look amazing,\" he said.</p> <p>Savides shot six features for Gus van Sant and collaborated with David Fincher, Sofia Coppola and Noah Baumbach. While directors frequently turned to him for a visual style redolent of 1970s American and European auteur cinema, Savides was at the forefront of digital experimentation. He shot Fincher's Zodiac (2007), the fastidiously detailed story of the real-life hunt for a serial killer in San Francisco in the 1960s, entirely on the <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117978331?refcatid=13\" title=\"Variety interview with Savides about using the HD Viper camera\">HD Viper camera</a>. going to great lengths to give the movie an authentic period texture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397643408\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041147510/Harris-Savides-with-Sofia-008.jpg\" alt=\"Harris Savides with Sofia Coppola\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harris Savides with Sofia Coppola. The pair made two films together, Somewhere and The Bling Ring. Photograph: Franco Biciocchi/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franco Biciocchi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in New York and raised there in the Bronx, Savides studied film and still photography at the city's School of Visual Arts. He became a fashion photographer before moving into commercials and music videos for REM (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pudOFG5X6uA\" title=\"REM's Everybody Hurts video\">Everybody Hurts</a>), Madonna (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15kWlTrpt5k\" title=\"Madonna's Rain video\">Rain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaFgAwnRSc\" title=\"Madonna's Bedtime Story video\">Bedtime Story</a>) and Nine Inch Nails (Closer). His first break in film-making came from the softcore producer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/arts/television/zalman-king-creator-of-soft-core-films-dies-at-70.html\" title=\"Zalman King obituary in the New York Times\">Zalman King</a>, who hired him to photograph Lake Consequence (1993) only three months after Savides's first commercials. He went on to shoot Heaven's Prisoners (1996), starring Alec Baldwin, after doing some second unit work on Fincher's influential Seven (1995). Fincher then appointed him as director of photography on the playful thriller The Game (1997).</p> <p>Savides became known for his trademark technique of lighting the space in which he was working, rather than individual actors: \"That's a mantra for me. When I approach a scene, I light the space, and in doing that, I hopefully light the people enough to make it work and also keep it real.\"</p> <p>If this style posed problems amid the multi-camera frenzy of a big-budget project such as Ridley Scott's American Gangster (2007), it could be seen to ravishing effect in the more intimate, painterly settings of James Gray's The Yards (1999) or Jonathan Glazer's Birth (2004), starring Nicole Kidman as a woman confronted with a child claiming to be the reincarnation of her late husband. In Birth, the muted colours of the opulent Upper West Side setting in New York conveyed a cloistered world that was polite but bloodless \u2013 a perfect backdrop for the story's messy, unruly emotions.</p> <p>By that time, Savides had begun his most fruitful partnership with Van Sant, who hired him to shoot the sentimental drama Finding Forrester (2000) and retained his services for a trilogy of films that embraced the avant garde, most obviously in their use of long takes. The trilogy began with the minimalist Gerry (2002), which followed two friends (Matt Damon and Casey Affleck), both named Gerry, as they become lost on a desert hike. \"After working through Gerry,\" said Savides, \"I felt like I understood film-making for the first time. In working so simply, I gained a confidence that I never had before.\"</p> <p>In Van Sant's Palme d'Or-winning Elephant (2003), which drew on the Columbine shootings of four years earlier, Savides used a gliding Steadicam to follow the students through school corridors in extended, dreamlike sequences. The apparently floating camera was inhibited by shooting in the classical 4:3 aspect ratio, which restricts the image to a screen squarer than has become usual. The most experimental film in the trilogy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/sep/02/nirvana\" title=\"Peter Bradshaw's review of Last Days\">Last Days</a> (2005), imagined the life of a rock star (based on Kurt Cobain) through scenes as meandering and inscrutable as they were luminously photographed.</p> <p>Savides shot two more movies for Van Sant: Milk (2008), a biopic of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to public office in America, and Restless (2011). He also photographed Woody Allen's Whatever Works (2009) and Coppola's Somewhere (2010), as well as two films for Baumbach: Margot at the Wedding (2007) and Greenberg (2010). He was consulted by the director Andrew Stanton, who wanted to bring live-action photographic techniques to his Pixar animated feature WALL-E (2008).</p> <p>It was announced in 2010 that Savides would shoot the adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's 9/11-themed novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, but illness forced him to pull out. At the time of his death, he had recently finished work on Coppola's The Bling Ring, starring Emma Watson as one of a group of teenagers who break into the homes of celebrities.</p> <p>Savides is survived by his wife, Medine, whom he married in 1983, and their daughter, Sophie.</p> <p>\u2022 Harris Savides, cinematographer, born 28 September 1957; died 9 October 2012</p>",

Even if one ignores the tergiversations of the budget, Hunt, for example, should surely at the very least have been shunted sideways when his relationship with the Murdochs were exposed and Mitchell binned</p> <p>It is a fallacy to suggest that the British electorate expects our elected representatives to be omniscient and omnipotent. We don't but we do expect ministers to own up to their mistakes rather than trying to cover them up with a shovel and prime ministers to act as they would if they were chief executives in any other business. Boris Johnson's current popularity may be misplaced but it comes largely from the fact that he is a WISIWIG politician and people accept him, warts and all, in a way they don't accept Messrs Cameron and Osborne. PR and spin in the end is usually counterproductive whereas honesty commands respect.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18811431\"><strong>nyasgold</strong></a> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Milliband comes across as genuine,a rare quality in a politician.He also appears to be someone with conviction,again rare.Clegg and his party remain an irrelevance,and surely heading for oblivion.So to,hopefully the most divisive party in British politics.Led by the most overated lightweight ever to hold such high office.Their most be a real dearth of talent in the Tory party,if Cameron is seriously all that have to offer.An empty shell of a man ,devoid of any real beliefs,governing by You Gov polls.A weak leader with appaling judgement,and someone willing to use personal tradgedy for political gain.History,if it even bothers,will remember him for what he is.A one term PM who failed to beat a discredited Labour party in the midst of the biggest financial crisis since the 1930s,and led his own party into another generation in the political wilderness.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18812661\"><strong>Alfilio</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be difficult for anything as inconsequential as a party conference to make me dislike the Tory or LibDem parties any more than I did before. I thought Ed Miliband's speech was pretty good, a bit OTT and melodramatic in places but he definitely upped his game; can the rest of the party do the same.<br>It would require a major stretch of the imagination to think of any politician as trustworthy but generally I believe that Labour is more likely to understand and is more supportive of issues that affect the everyday lives of people on lower incomes.<br>After Ed's speech I became a member of the Labour party. It wasn't just because of the speech, I've generally supported Labour all my life and in fact the main reason for joining up was the dirty tricks used once again by the Tories. They started targeting Gordon Brown at least 9 months before the last election and doubtless will do the same with Ed Miliband in 2015. Tories supported by big business and the media employing despicable tactics borrowed from the US Republican party. Why would any fair minded person want to support a party like that.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18813580\">TonyToday</a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cameron looks to be desperately looking for any sort of bandwagon to jump on to reverse his growing unpopularity on the doorsteps. Osborne sounds as if he's just about given up the ghost on his failing policies. More of the same just isn't going to cut it.<br>Labour sound as if they're saying we'll be different next time but haven't quite worked out how.<br>The LibDems are beyond redemption.</p> <p>Having said that, I don't think we should run away with the idea that the last three weeks will have made a huge impression on the population at large and the general political direction looks the same as it did a month ago. I think the next few months will be the same very hard going for the coalition that they looked in September. Cameron is going to come under fire again from his own right wing once they realise he's not in a position to deliver on any of his conference rhetoric. Ed M is gaining a little momentum but still has a very long way to go. Clegg is finished - and so are the LibDems if they don't ditch him next year.</p> </blockquote> <h2>GCSE resits</h2> <p>More than 45,000 school pupils <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/11/45000-resit-gcse-english-exams?commentpage=all#start-of-comments\">are to resit GCSE English exams in November following a scandal over grades.</a> The thread heard from parents of many affected exam-takers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18786530\"><strong>TheWombat</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My daughter's school took the WJEC board exam and I think it is outrageous that she and her classmates have different grade boundaries to the welsh students. Compounding the situation is the different grade boundaries from January to June. In such an important subject which is required for College and University entrance and to downgrade the students is plainly unfair. I have no objections to making the exams harder or tightening up on grade boundaries, but to move the goal posts half way through is truly shocking and deeply unfair on the students.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18787192\"><strong>HeronsFlight</strong></a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A strange thing happened at my partner's school this week.

Instead, OFQAL (Who are insistent that no-one was pulling their strings, despite what we all think) have seriously endangered not only the self esteem, but the future earning potential and lives of 45,000 students.

Both sets of children did well at their school work, are socially adept and empathic and are able in their careers, jobs or tasks. All are very good at thinking for themselves.

  "<p>In his <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/palestinian-authority/abbas-remarks-un-general-assembly-september-2012/p29168\" title=\"\">recent speech</a> to the UN general assembly, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas warned that Israel's ongoing settlement construction in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank would make the creation of a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel \"extremely difficult if not completely impossible\".</p> <p>It is not only Palestinians who see Israeli settlements as one of the main obstacles to peace \u2013 the international community does too, as do many Israeli peace activists.</p> <p>Despite that, there is a small but growing group of religious settlers who believe that far from being an impediment to peace, they can actually help build it. This movement is led by the charismatic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Froman\" title=\"\">Rabbi Menachem Froman</a>.</p> <p>Rabbi Froman cuts an unlikely figure as a peace activist. He is an ideological settler, yet believes in the two-state solution along the pre-1967 green line. He was one of the founders of the messianic, religious settler movement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Emunim\" title=\"\">Gush Emunim</a> (\"Bloc of the Faithful\"), and supports continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank, yet believes in and promotes coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis, Jews and Arabs.</p> <p>Adding to his maverick credentials, Froman was friends with the late Yasser Arafat and met regularly with the late Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas. He is also close to Abbas, meets regularly with Binyamin Netanyahu, and negotiated, along with Palestinian journalist Khalid Amayreh, a ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which would have ended the blockade on Gaza \u2013 which the Islamist group agreed to but Israel simply ignored.</p> <p>This renegade rabbi so intrigued me that I visited him, along with an American-Israeli filmmaker <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6QnrHgFjnY\" title=\"\">making a documentary</a> about this enigmatic figure, in his modest home in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekoa,_Gush_Etzion\" title=\"\">Tekoa</a>, an Israeli settlement near Bethlehem.</p> <p>So, how does Rabbi Froman propose to square the circle between his support for Jewish settlements and Palestinian statehood? Religious Muslims and Jews believe, he says, \"that this land is holy \u2026 that this land belongs to God. This can be a very strong basis for peace\".</p> <p>In his view, since it is the land itself that is holy and not the political structure governing it, settlers should be given the choice to become part of a Palestinian state or move to Israel. Froman also believes that the presence of an Arab minority in Israel and a Jewish minority in Palestine would have the additional benefit of promoting tolerance and understanding between the two neighbouring countries.</p> <p>The Palestinian Authority has, on a number of occasions, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">floated the possibility</a> that Israeli settlers can be given the option to live under Palestinian sovereignty. However, this option elicits fears. Palestinians worry that the settlers would remain Israeli citizens and hold on to their privileged status, as well as possibly providing Israel with a pretext to carry out military incursions, even invasions.</p> <p>I asked Froman whether, in his vision, the settlers would become Palestinian citizens and live according to Palestinian law, and whether the settlements would become mixed neighbourhoods for all. \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he responded emphatically. \"The keyword here is to be open, to be free.\"</p> <p>Froman's vision chimes with that of <a href=\"http://chronikler.com/middle-east/israel-palestine/shlomo-sand/\" title=\"\">some pro-Palestinian Israeli leftists</a>. However, ideological settlers, who generally see the land and Israel's control over it as vital, do not share Froman's vision. \"I reject the two-state solution,\" David Wilder, the spokesperson for the radical settlers in Hebron, <a href=\"http://chronikler.com/middle-east/israel-palestine/hebron-settlers-6/\" title=\"\">told me</a> some months ago. \"I want to live in Israel. I came to live in Israel, under Jewish leadership. I didn't come to live under the rule of anybody else, certainly not an Arab.\"</p> <p>Economic settlers are also unlikely to want to become Palestinian citizens, though they could more easily be persuaded to move under the right conditions.</p> <p>\"The question is not the Palestinian attitude,\" Froman freely acknowledges. \"The question is the Israelis: if Israel and Israeli settlers are ready to be part of the Palestinian state.\"</p> <p>But he believes that, once they overcome their fear and distrust, people can be persuaded. \"It's all a matter of confidence,\" the rabbi insists.</p> <p>Froman is also a strong believer in the power of religion to resolve the conflict. This, you could say, was something of a revelation to me, as I have long viewed religion as a major stumbling block on the path to peace \u2013 it is what I call the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\" title=\"\">God veto</a>\".</p> <p>But Froman believes that one major factor behind the failure of the peace process is that it ignored or did not pay enough attention to the religious dimension. \"[Sheikh] Ahmed Yassin used to say to me: 'I and you, Hakham [Rabbi] Froman, can make peace in five minutes, because both of us are religious'.\"</p> <p>The very idea that an Orthodox rabbi and an Islamist sheikh would engage in dialogue, let alone believe that they can resolve a conflict that has defied everyone else for decades, is likely to confound both Palestinians and Israelis alike.</p> <p>\"Religion is like nuclear energy: you can use it to destroy or to kill. You can also use it for peaceful purposes,\" the rabbi observes. \"The Dome of the Rock or the Temple Mount can be a reason to quarrel or a reason to make peace.\"</p> <p>Despite his fine words, I left the meeting sceptical that Froman's vision would, especially in the current climate, attract many takers. However, our encounter did drive home some important lessons: the situation is never black and white, peacemakers can be found in the most unlikely places, and that we must understand the obstacles to peace if we ever hope to remove them.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight</p>",

  "<p>If you read about scientific fraud in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/oct/01/tenfold-increase-science-paper-retracted-fraud\">recent news</a>, it would seem that there is much to worry about. It's on the rise, apparently! There has been a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/27/1212247109\">10-fold increase in the number of retracted papers since the 1970's</a>, and a number of these are due to fraud or suspected fraud. </p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/27/1212247109\"> investigation</a> of retractions from the biomedical scientific literature database <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed\">PubMed</a> published in the prestigious <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA (PNAS)</em> found that a whopping 63.2% of health- and life-science related retractions were due to fraud, suspected fraud or plagiarism, with good old honest error retractions in the sound minority. This sounds scary \u2013 especially the 'suspected fraud'. Is this just the tip of the scientific deceit iceberg? Just how many lies are lurking in the scientific literature? </p> <p>Then there are the stories. <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-09-05/white-coat-notes/33593693_1_research-misconduct-marc-hauser-research-integrity\">Professor Marc Hauser</a> (formerly) of Harvard was accused by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services's Office of Research Integrity of <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Document-Sheds-Light-on/123988/\">inventing results</a> to support his idea of a biological foundation for cognition in monkeys \u2013 specifically if they could recognize changes in sound patterns like human babies can. Hauser was a popular scientist too; he even has a best-selling book: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/books/review/Rorty.t.html?pagewanted=all &amp;_r=\" 0\")\"><em>Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong</em></a> where he somewhat ironically argued that \"policy wonks and politicians should listen more closely to our intuitions and write policy that effectively takes into account the moral voice of our species.\" Which worked out in his case; he was busted for scientific misconduct. His book also tells us that \"our ability to detect cheaters who violate social norms is one of nature's gifts\". Nature's gifts or not, his students and research assistants <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Document-Sheds-Light-on/123988/\">blew the whistle</a>.</p> <p>And this isn't just in life science, it's everywhere. Physics has its high profile cheaters too! There is <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/physics-and-pixie-dust\">Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n</a>, the physicist who made up his data \u2013 26 of his papers have been retracted and he has been <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/09/jan-hendrik-schon-loses-his-phd.html\">stripped of his doctoral degree</a>. And then there is <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/14/cold-fusion\">the cold fusion boys</a> who, to be fair, are probably more victims of faulty equipment and sticking to your beloved theory despite the facts, than perpetrators of actual fraud. Psychology is not immune either; <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/06/26/why-a-new-case-of-misconduct-in-psychology-heralds-interesting-times-for-the-field/\">Dirk Smeester, whose results seemed too good to be true</a>, has also been caught just making stuff up. </p> <p>Is no scientific discipline safe? Are scientists just incapable of keeping their modern houses clean? It has been argued that because of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/oct/01/tenfold-increase-science-paper-retracted-fraud\">recent pressure</a> for scientists to publish groundbreaking results that change the world, the temptation to commit fraud is perhaps bound to increase, implying that there was a simpler, more honest time for science. Dewy-eyed, there is a temptation to believe that scientists back in the day were only of high moral character and were purely duty-bound to pursue the truth. But this isn't really true. Fraud in science isn't new, just like fraud in anything isn't new. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_report_finds/note_pilt_man.html\">Take Piltdown Man</a>, the famous Sussex fossil. In 1912, amateur archaeologist and premier forager <a href=\"http://www.badarchaeology.com/?page_id=930\">Charles Dawson</a> discovered the link between ape and man \u2013 Piltdown Man. He presented his results to the Geological Society and was much revered for his discovery \u2013 huzzah, a link which proved Darwin's theory! Piltdown man was 1912's version of high-impact science and as such had some legs. It was used as far abroad as Tennessee in 1925 by the theatrical Clarence Darrow during the <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ug97/inherit/1925home.html\">Scopes monkey trial</a> in defense of teaching evolution in schools. Piltdown man was finally <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1931133_1931132_1931125,00.html\">proven to be a hoax </a> in 1953. Not a mistake \u2013 a hoax. Orangutan jawbone, human skull. It turns out Dawson himself was somewhat of a serial fraudster; he also faked findings of Roman bricks and proof of early Roman iron casting. Serial fraudsters are modern too, according to the findings from PNAS, which found that 44% of the fraud-retractions are due to serial fraud. </p> <p>Upon a slightly closer inspection, looking at the actual retraction numbers in the PNAS study, there have been a total of 2047 papers retracted (between 1977 and May 2012) from the biomedical literature. This is 2047 papers out of almost 25 million papers in the PubMed database - so 0.00008% in total. This number is tiny. Yes, there has been a 10-fold increase in the microscopic number of retracted papers in 1977 (0.00096%) relative to the similarly microscopic number (0.0096%) in the period from 2007 to May 2012, but it is still a microscopic number. It is not an increase significant enough to even really worry about. </p> <p>Still, fraud stories are scary, even if infrequent. Scientific works reported in academic journals undergo peer-review prior to publication, so on the surface it might seem that fraud should be more easily detected. In the peer-review process, or reading any scientific publication for that matter, trust is important. In the same way we trust people in general. Some people lie, some people don't. If you meet a new person and they tell you they used to live say in Tennessee, you usually just believe them, without doing a background check. If they are lying, it usually becomes pretty apparent after a few minutes, especially if you have been to Tennessee. Unless of course they are pretty good liars or you have never been to Tennessee \u2013 then it might take a bit longer to work it out. </p> <p>The same thing happens in scientific literature; when a paper is reviewed, no one goes for a visit to the laboratory where the work was done \u2013 there has to be some degree of trust. If someone is falsifying data they usually get found out. No one else can repeat the experiments, no one else can find any evidence for the authors' claims. This is actually a standard part of science. Scientific experiments must be repeatable. Theories or hypotheses must verifiable in some manner to stand the test of time. If a scientific work cannot be verified or repeated then it tumbles off into oblivion, like most scientific theories (most people for instance have never heard of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory\">theory of phlogiston</a>, though it was a very popular scientific theory back in the day). Rather than heading for an iceberg that threatens to sink modern science in a wave of fraud and deceit, science is the same as it ever was. Errors in the science literature, whether a result of fraud or honest errors or faulty equipment, ultimately will either fall off into obscurity or get found out \u2013 like Sch\u00f6n, Hauser and Piltdown man. Science has a way of righting itself, as to be successful in the long run it must stand the test of time.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2012. The original stated that the PNAS study hadn't been normalised against the total number of papers published per year in the biomedical sciences. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Heroin, marijuana and a loaded gun were found on Nelly's tour bus this week, during a police stop in Texas. The rapper and the vehicle's other passengers were detained by sheriffs in Sierra Blanca, Texas, until a member of Nelly's entourage declared that the drugs and gun were his. Nelly was then released.</p> <p>\"It is my understanding a member of my staff made an unfortunate decision to bring unlawful materials on to our tour bus that resulted in his arrest this morning,\" Nelly said in a statement to TMZ. \"Neither I nor anyone else on the tour bus was aware of his decision to bring these on board. Law enforcement officials did not press charges against anyone other than that individual.\"</p> <p>Nelly's tour bus pulled into a border patrol checkpoint, according to <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/drugs-gun-found-rapper-nellys-bus-texas-checkpoint-001621135.html\" title=\"\">Reuters</a>, where a police dog detected controlled substances.

  "<p>It's been almost two years since the Arab spring began and it is clear that there is nervousness about further change across the Middle East. Illustrating the point, this week saw a high-profile attack from the United Arab Emirates on the Muslim Brotherhood, which has emerged as the biggest political force in Egypt and Tunisia and has been prominent in post-Gaddafi Libya, as well as the ongoing uprising in Syria.<br> The UAE's foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, denounced the Brotherhood as \"an organization which encroaches upon the sovereignty and integrity of nations\" - expanding on a call to fellow Gulf states to cooperate against it. The chances of success seem slim, not least because the Brotherhood is legal in Kuwait and Qatar \u2013 from where (to the chagrin of other hereditary Arab rulers), the emir has been punching above his weight by backing Islamists all over the region.</p> <p>In recent months the UAE authorities have cracked down on peaceful demonstrations, arrested 60 activists, some of them members of the Brotherhood linked Islah (Reform) movement, stripped others of their citizenship, and disbanded the elected boards of civil society organizations. </p> <p>Emirati media have reported that the Islamists have confessed to forming a secret organization aimed at destabilizing the country's political system. Islah has denied these claims and says any confessions must have been made under torture. Brotherhood spokesmen in Egypt have rebuffed Nahyan's broader comments, accused the UAE government of corruption and reiterated their own commitment to democratic change. President Mohammed Morsi has insisted that Egypt's revolution is \"not for export.\"</p> <p>It is, to put it mildly, a touchy issue for the UAE (as it is for the other Gulf monarchies). Officials and intellectuals fret that their neighbourhood has become much more dangerous since the start of the Arab uprisings and the looming crisis over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Michael Hudson, the American academic, <a href=\" http://www.mei.nus.edu.sg/publications/mei-insights/letter-from-abu-dhabi-are-the-gulf-states-immune-to-\" regional-changes\" \"\">described the mood</a> well on a recent visit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Perhaps naively, I asked a group of specialists from Gulf countries why they would have any problem with Islamist parties emerging to play a decisive role in Tunisia, Egypt, and other countries affected by the uprisings. After all, wouldn't they be happier with more culturally like-minded regimes coming to power? I felt like a dentist who had just touched a nerve.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br> It is also clear that while the UAE has an interest in maintaining the image of the Brotherhood as subversive bogeymen, Islamists do have their own agenda \u2013 though their appeal appears limited. As the commentator Sultan al-Qasemi has<a href=\" http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2012/al-monitor/the-uae-security-crackdown-a-vie.html\"> argued:<br></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br> UAE citizens (are) apprehensive about protesting or making public political demands for fear of triggering a societal chain reaction. Another reason is the unknown alternative; is the vision that the inexperienced and opportunistic political Islamists offer any better than the status quo? That is highly doubtful.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> The Emirati authorities, in any event, do not take negative publicity lying down. A recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/uae-descent-oppression?INTCMP=SRCH\">comment piece </a>in the Guardian by an Islah activist has attracted particular venom. The fightback in Abu Dhabi has been fast and abusive. Under a Twitter hashtag #UK_supports_traitors the Guardian and BBC have been accused of being in the pay of the Qataris; knowledge of Arabic is produced as evidence of involvement in \"espionage.\" Harassed foreign office diplomats are being forced to explain that the British government does not control the British press.</p> <p>But the campaign is wider than that. The UAE has been lobbying hard in both Washington and London against their \"honeymoon\" with the new regimes of the Arab spring, with special emphasis on Egypt. It is perhaps over-stating the case to call this effort a Gulf \"counter-revolution\" but the Cold War notion of \"containment\" certainly fits the bill.</p> <p>British officials are troubled by this not least because UK exports to the UAE are worth a whopping \u00a34.7 bn a year \u2013 at a time when relations with the Gulf are focused more than ever on trade and investment opportunities. Dialogue on human rjghts, the foreign office says, is conducted privately. These tensions - public and private - are reminders that the hopes and fears created by the Arab spring are not going away any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Five days after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/mona-eltahawy-released-new-york-subway\">I spraypainted over a racist and bigoted advertisement in the New York subway</a>, a man set fire to my brother's local mosque. He struck just a few hours after the mosque's kindergarten had been filled with children at Sunday school, including my four nieces and nephews.</p> <p>It was a coincidental correlation but there was nothing casual about either the hate speech on the walls of the subway \u2013 which a judge declared \"protected political statement\" \u2013 or the arson in Ohio, which was described as an \"act of terrorism\" by officials who announced federal hate crime charges against the suspect. </p> <p>American rightwingers \u2013 in between calling me a \"bitch\" and \"cunt\" countless times \u2013 would have you know I'm an \"Islamo-Nazi anti-speech ungrateful immigrant\" incapable of appreciating the wonders of the first amendment. The right is incredibly deft at getting earnest about all the wrong things. It was precisely my love of the first amendment that made me join sidewalk activists in 2010 to support an Islamic community center's right to open in Lower Manhattan. As a member of a minority whose very presence has been considered an offense \u2013 \"Why can't you just move a few blocks away? Can't you see you're hurting our feelings?\" \u2013 of course, I believe in the right to offend: it's a two-way street. </p> <p>A bag of dogshit was left at the doorstep of Park51, a car circled the building and our protest with a decommissioned missile mounted on its roof, and Tea Partiers often visited the protest to pick arguments. </p> <p>When I first heard about those subway ads, Park51 immediately came to mind. Pamela Geller connects the dots of hate, determined to mine the depths of American ignorance to once again bully Muslims and Arabs. Her group, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Islamization_of_America\">Stop Islamization of America</a>, was behind attempts to shut down Park51, calling it the \"Ground Zero Mosque\". Her recent subway ad, paid for by her anti-Muslim American Freedom Defense Initiative, conflates \"savage\" (a heinous word loaded with a dehumanizing and bloody history in this country; ask blacks and Native Americans) with Palestinian/Muslim/Arab and with \"Jihad\".</p> <p>All of us are lumped together on one side, and Israel is assumed to be the antithesis of all those things on the other: the good, the civilized, the only choice in the face of our \"savagery\". The ad reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Between two Stars of David, it adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Resist the disingenuous argument that she's speaking out against \"Jihad\" and not Islam. When Islamophobes in Europe \u2013 Geert Wilders and the English Defense League \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.civilfreedoms.org/?p=13407\">unite to come to visit Geller</a> and meet with mainstream Republican heavyweight such as Andrew Bolt and Newt Gingrich, you must understand it is for the purpose of vilifying all Muslims.</p> <p>I received my first death threat after I condemned Yale University Press for pulling the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy\">now-notorious Jyllands-Posten cartoons</a> of Prophet Mohammad from a book it was publishing on the crisis. I supported that newspaper's right to run those cartoons, which offended so many. </p> <p>If I wanted to block the Geller ad's hate speech, I would have given it the NYC treatment that I witnessed just two hours before I spraypainted it. A man in a suit who introduced himself as \"Morgan\" very casually ripped \u2013 not once but twice \u2013 one of the ads on 49th Street Station.</p> <p>\"This is fucking New York City. It's unacceptable,\" he told a camerawoman who caught it all. The media had learned to go to the ads, anticipating problems: several had had \"Racist\" and \"Hate speech\" stuck on them as soon as they appeared. </p> <p>So, if I'd wanted to \"block\" or \"shut down\" free speech, I would've gone to Time Square station with black spraypaint. Or even easier, I would've just ripped them, Morgan-style. Instead, I chose pink. Pink matched my coat, and pink was the least violent colour there was. Pink was see-through, even. I'd actually planned on spraying \"RACIST\" across the ad, but I realised with the first spray that it was much harder to get the can to behave. I will be taking up offers for lessons from NYC and Cairo taggers, and next time take a stencil with me. </p> <p>First, I told several friends that I would probably get arrested. I was fine with getting arrested. I can't stand bullies and Geller is a bully with deep pockets. I had no idea so much media would be there, nor that a Geller supporter would add to the spectacle by thrusting her body between me and the vile ad.</p> <p>I wanted to use my profile as a commentator to test \"protected speech\": if hate speech is protected, is my protest at it also protected? And if not, why not? What if the choice on the ad were reversed: \"Choose Jihad. Defeat Israel.\" What if the ad vilified African Americans, or Jews, or any other group for which public denigration is less permissible?</p> <p>Banning hate speech doesn't end racism or antisemitism. Social pressure does that. It becomes socially unacceptable. To get to that level of unacceptability, we must stand up to hate-mongers like Geller. Clearly, not enough of us are doing so if <a href=\"http://www.christianpost.com/news/sojourners-expands-billboard-campaign-in-response-to-toledo-mosque-arson-82790/\">hate crimes against Muslims in the US tripled in 2010-2011</a>.</p> <p>We seem to have arrived in some crazy Alice in Wonderland world where a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Anti-Jihad-Subway-Ad-Spray-Paint-Arrest-Tussle-Fight-Video-171272581.html\">woman is willing to use her body to \"defend\" hate speech</a>. Pamela Hall, I realised later, is to hate speech what Judith Miller, the once-renowned New York Times reporter, became to protecting sources. Pamela Hall was a human shield to hate, Judith Miller went to jail rather than reveal her source. But her source wasn't an endangered whistleblower. Rather, it was Scooter Libby, a Dick Cheney aid who helped blow the cover of CIA agent Valerie Plame. </p> <p>As I said, the right is earnest about the wrong things. Too many on the left are earnest about nothing at all, sadly. They've been rendered spineless by snarkiness \u2013 not least on Twitter. I'm the first to admit that Twitter helped tremendously after I was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/24/mona-eltahawy-twitter-tweets-egypt\">beaten and sexually assaulted and then detained by Egyptian security forces</a> last year. But it is the height of spinelessness to just hashtag our objection to ads that are promoting hate in the public square, seen by millions in the subway every day.</p> <p>A Muslim woman spray painting a hateful ad in pink was also, for me, the antidote to the tired clich\u00e9 of \"Muslim rage\". My inbox was flooded with racists and bigots lecturing me about how America works. But equal numbers of young Americans also contacted me, wanting to join in future acts of civil disobedience. </p> <p>I broke the law, yes. So what?</p> <p>I broke it to make a point of principle. Eleven years after the 9/11 attacks, American Muslims are still being bullied and vilified. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/06/13146671-mosque-in-missouri-burns-to-the-ground-one-month-after-arson-attack?lite\">mosque in Joplin, Missouri, was burned to the ground</a> in August, just over a month after an attempted arson at that same Islamic center. Another Islamic center, in <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/11/after-long-fight-opening-day_n_1768915.html\">Murfreesboro, Tennessee, endured years of legal wrangling</a>, vandalism, bomb threats and anti-Muslim sentiment since planning commissioners granted approval in 2010 for an expansion project at the existing mosque. </p> <p>Jewish and Christian groups have paid for counter-ads that will hang next to Geller's hate speech and the <a href=\"http://www.mta.info/mta/news/releases/?en=120927-HQ1\">MTA has modified its advertising standards</a>. I have no idea if any of those initiatives was inspired by my protest; several others also defaced the hate posters with stickers. Veteran civil liberties activist Sherry Wolf and three 19-year-old students joined me in a holding cell for several hours after they did so.</p> <p>I'm convinced that bullies need to know that Muslims will give them the finger. I deliberately didn't spray or hit Pamela Hall because I didn't want my protest to be about assault or violence. I gave the finger to the Tea Party during the Park51 protest, and spraying the poster was my way of doing the same to Pamela Geller. </p> <p>Pink is for protest and not princesses. Pink is for my nieces, especially. They will not grow up to be scared or apologetic for being Muslim, or Egyptian, or brown. That refusal to be intimidated by bullies is the message I take again and again from young Muslims who have written to me. Many were just 10 or 11 when 9/11 happened, and they refuse to apologise for something they had nothing to do with. Why should they?</p> <p>The only hashtag I will consider is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Proudsavage&amp;src=hash\">#ProudSavage</a>.</p>",

  "<p>The first difference between ploughing through A-levels and studying a law degree is the amount of independent research required.

You'll be spending a good deal of time in the library and probably more at your laptop, finding resources online. </p> <p>However, law is one subject where Google won't be a lot of help to you: legal information is expensive stuff and universities pay tens of thousands of pounds each year to ensure you have access to key databases like Westlaw and LexisLibrary. Your law librarian will help you become an expert researcher. You'll learn which resources are best for the job, how to be cost and resource aware and ways to keep records of your research trail.</p> <p>These skills will also be crucial when you come to tackle the next key extra-curricular activity \u2013 mooting. For many students, it is the one way in which you can feel like you're doing something \"properly lawyerly\" during your time at law school. It's the first opportunity to practise arguing a case in front of a judge. It happens in teams - one acting for the appellant and one for the respondent - each of whom will cover a separate ground of appeal. Mooting is a specialised skill where each team tries to find that elusive case which will convince the judge to find in their favour.</p> <p>Taking part in mooting is probably one of the quickest and most effective ways of acquiring the skills of a lawyer. It requires the use of a very formal language; everyone must be addressed in the correct way and disagreeing with a judge, for example, must be approached very carefully. However, it is also useful for developing skills that can be applied in almost every walk of life, from analysis and interpretation of facts, to successfully arguing your point and confident public speaking.</p> <p>While much of the activity takes place within your law school, you may also get the opportunity to do it competitively and represent your law school nationally. It can be a particularly exhilarating experience when you get to do it in a fantastic location in front of a top judge. For example, fancy arguing your case in front of a Lord at the supreme court? MacKenzie Common, the winner of this year's City Scholars Moot got to do just that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Mooting forced me to take what I learned in class and really think about it, diving into a topic and understanding what the scholars and judges really made of it. The knowledge I had on certain topics also helped me on midterms, where I was able to cite additional cases and academic articles to kick up my arguments a notch\".</p> </blockquote> <p>The final activity which binds the skills of mooting and legal research together is pro bono. Rather than being a niche section of the U2 fan club, this is the opportunity for students to provide real advice to genuine clients. Universities often partner with commercial and charitable programmes at local, national and international level to make this possible. </p> <p>As you progress in your legal studies, more pro bono doors can open to you. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jan/09/innocence-project-conviction-hilary-swank\">Innocence Project</a>, enables students to learn about miscarriages of justice and investigate real cases of convicted prisoners who believe have been wrongly convicted. Elsewhere, the <a href=\"http://www.ncdv.org.uk/\">National Centre for Domestic Violence</a>, provides free assistance to victims who are seeking urgent injunctions, but do not have the financial means to obtain representation from a solicitor. </p> <p>Participating students work alongside police officers and specialist family law professionals to learn about injunctions and preparing a case file. These opportunities gives students the real life work experience which not only improves your CV, but also boosts your self-confidence and makes a genuine difference in the community.</p> <p>So, an undergraduate law degree shouldn't produce nightmares about being buried under books; law school is a place that offers lots of extra-curricular opportunities, allows you to develop skills which are relevant to an array of careers, as well as giving you the chance to put theory into practice. Oh and did I say lots of reading?</p>",

  "<p>A year ago, with Europe mired in its deepest crisis for 60 years and an air of revolt sweeping the continent, the Guardian teamed up with five other European newspapers to explore the question of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/europa\" title=\"\">what the EU is for</a>. The union is currently reviled perhaps like never before: a euro debacle, debt swamping the continent, expansion stalled, sluggish economies going backwards, euroscepticism on the rise. But what of the European success stories? What about trade, movement of people, prosperity, environmental law? What about social programmes, collective heft and \u2013 as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/european-union-nobel-peace-prize\" title=\"\">Nobel prize committee</a> pointed out \u2013 the advent of peace in a part of the world that had been blighted by cataclysmic war every couple of generations?</p> <p>A team of reporters for the Europa project fanned out to find out what the EU did well. There is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/europa-single-market-manufacturing-midlands\" title=\"\">single market</a>, which our report argued \"has made goods cheaper, labour cheaper, and trade more secure and more competitive. The knock-on effects are felt across the economy, from the jobs created and the cheaper costs of manpower to foreign direct investment that pours in from countries enticed by getting a foothold in the world's richest consumer market.\"</p> <p>There are the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jan/25/europa-airbus-military-european-business\" title=\"\">cross-border businesses</a> that find it easier to operate in a single economic space. There is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/europa-poles-german-labour-market-border\" title=\"\">free movement of people</a> that has made life easier for border inhabitants and created job opportunities everywhere \u2013 and not just for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/jean-marc-bosman-football-spain\" title=\"\">highly paid footballers</a>. There are the social transfers that provide safety nets where national governments have none. \"I don't think our foundation could continue to exist unless we had those sources of EU money,\" one British programme director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/europa-deprived-young-people-video-games\" title=\"\">told us</a>.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/europa-wildlife-protection-london-gateway\" title=\"\">green spaces</a>, protected largely by EU directives \u2013 although the report card is less glowing when it comes to agriculture and fisheries. The eurozone has its problems of imbalance, productivity, growth, debt and unemployment, certainly. The EU is harder to dismiss.</p>",

So not the easiest set-up given I had to select a date for an engineer to visit, then make sure someone was home when he came.</p> <p><strong>Content </strong>I have the no-frills Sky Entertainment package which includes Sky 1, Sky Atlantic, Sky Arts and a handful of more obscure channels such as Syfy, Comedy Central and Dmax, as well as all the usual Freeview channels and an endless parade of food, shopping, lifestyle and \"+1\" channels. My Sky+ HD box also provides some free HD channels \u2013 BBC HD and ITV HD etc.</p> <p>Sky has introduced catch-up TV but isn't currently offering BBC iPlayer, which is apparently \"coming soon\", or 4oD (coming 2013), and doesn't integrate them into the electronic programme guide (EPG), meaning you have to find each catch-up provider's separate app before seeing what historic content is available.</p> <p><strong>Navigation </strong>Sky's EPG is intuitive and easy to use, although that could be because I have used family and friends' boxes. It is fast and responsive with clear menu bars at the top and middle of the screen directing you to the many features.</p> <p><strong>Recording </strong>Both boxes allow you to pause and rewind live TV and to record programmes. The Sky+ set-up makes it easy to find past recordings, though a minor frustration is that if you leave the recording section with the child filter on, for example, the next time you access your recordings you will only see children-related programming \u2013 a pain when you want to find old episodes of The Sopranos.</p> <p><strong>Premium content </strong>Sky offers \"on demand\" programming, including TV series and films, the latter priced from about 99p for bargain movies up to \u00a33.49 for new releases.</p> <p><strong>Price </strong>This is difficult to compare because Sky has so many price plans, but I pay \u00a321.50 a month (discounted to \u00a310.75 for the first six months) for the Sky Entertainment package. I didn't pay anything for the Sky+ box or installation, so that makes \u00a3193.50 a year for my package.</p> <p>You can also add more bundles to your Sky subscription, such as the Sky Movies package for an extra \u00a316 a month on top of an existing Entertainment package.</p> <p><strong>Add-ons </strong>Sky offers a number of apps that allow you to use your phone as a remote control, set your box to record something remotely, or simply check the TV listings.</p> <p><strong>Rating </strong>8/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youview.com/\" title=\"YouView website\"><strong>YouView</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Installation </strong>I plugged the Humax DTR-T1000 YouView box in myself, following on-screen prompts to tune-in channels (optimised to my geographical location), as well as download the latest software and content. There were a few delays, but really anyone could plug it in and set it up reasonably quickly without the presence of an engineer.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong> YouView offers all the Freeview channels and a similar number of niche lifestyle channels as Sky, as well as the free-to-air HD channels \u2013 but it doesn't offer Sky channels.</p> <p>YouView has full seven-day catch-up from BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, 4oD and Demand 5 integrated into its EPG \u2013 a feature it calls Scrollback TV. This is a huge improvement over Sky+.</p> <p><strong>Navigation </strong>The YouView EPG is harder to read onscreen than its Sky counterpart; it's also slower. A click of the Sky remote and your function is completed instantly, whereas with the YouView box I sometimes had to wait a short while for it to comply.</p> <p><strong>Recording </strong>As with the EPG, my YouView box often took a while to respond when I clicked a button on the remote. Moreover, when fast forwarding on demand content it doesn't show the programme itself skipping ahead; instead it pauses the screen and only the time bar scrolls at the bottom. This is a nightmare if you're just trying to skip adverts or get to a certain point in a programme you've seen part of, as you don't know when to stop fast forwarding.</p> <p><strong>Premium content </strong>YouView has TV series and films on demand. The films are powered by Now TV, a Sky Movies initiative, and users pay from 99p for old films to \u00a33.49 for newer releases, or \u00a315 a month for a Sky Movies Pass which gives them unlimited downloads. The pass compares favourably with Sky's own package, as it's effectively the same content. BT and TalkTalk customers can also access BT Vision or TalkTalk Player content if they already subscribe to these channels.</p> <p><strong>Price</strong> Beyond on demand YouView is subscription-free, so the only cost is the box itself \u2013 from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Humax-DTR-T1000-YouView-Digital-Recorder/dp/B008J0QMYG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348222218&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">\u00a3249.95 at Amazon</a> for the 500GB version, which is enough storage for more than 150 films. It means a YouView viewer would break even with a Sky customer (on my package at least) after about 15 months, and possibly never pay a penny extra while Sky customers must keep on forking out month after month.</p> <p><strong>Add-ons </strong>YouView has little added functionality at present.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>7/10.</p> <p><strong>Mark's verdict </strong>YouView offers a cheap and easy-to-install way of watching and recording HD TV, while also offering catch-up TV from the likes of BBC iPlayer as well as on demand movies \u2013 all in one box. It really is great value and should be the default Freeview recorder of choice for consumers. But Sky offers a greater choice of channels, the EPG is more user-friendly and the ability to upgrade to sports and movie packages at any time are a real benefit, as is the sheer number of apps and add-ons designed to make viewers' lives easier. It's close, but I prefer Sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=507800d8e4b0584bebd83282\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=507800d8e4b0584bebd83282\"></script><a class=\"OPP-powered-by\" href=\"http://www.objectplanet.com/opinio/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><div style=\"font: 9px arial; color: gray;\">survey hosting</div></a> </figure>  <p></p>",
  "<p>Have you been wondering why your gardening has been a disaster this year? You're not on your own.</p> <p>Food prices are set to rise after a summer of wet weather has hit harvests. The global price of wheat has risen by 30% over the last year. Potato harvests are down by half in some areas. The NFU's Scottish cereal survey indicated wheat yield was down by 18% from 2011, winter barley yield down 7%, spring barley yield down 18% and winter oilseed rape yield down 26%.</p> <p>Apple growers in England say it's the worst harvest for 12 years and Save the Children reports that food price rises and volatility are the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/10/high-volatile-food-prices-normal?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">\"new normal\"</a>. Shoppers will be affected by higher prices for other crops, with global grain costs hit by American drought and Russian heatwave. The yo-yo flood and drought reflects a society not sure where or how to live and now unable to feed itself properly.</p> <p>This isn't the exaggeration of green miserabilism. New research by consumer group Which? found that the average cost of a shopping bill is now \u00a376.83 per week \u2013 an increase of \u00a35.66 on the previous year.</p> <p>Only three years ago, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, warned that the world faced a \"perfect storm\" of food, water and energy problems, due to global warming and the rising global population. Elements of that perfect storm are here now. Doubters can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/10/food-price-rise-uk-crop-harvest\" title=\"\">Damian Carrington's summary of recent scientific findings</a> or read the study released by Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance firm, which sees climate change driving increased weather volatility and predicts those influences <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2012/10/10/weather-disasters-climate-change-munich-re-report/1622845/\" title=\"\">will continue in years ahead</a>.</p> <p>It's clear we need to change the way we do food. We need to make food part of the solution not a growing part of the problem of climate change.</p> <p>But we're in for a shock. Cheap food, artificially low cheap food, is going to come under attack. Our manipulated subsidy of sectors of food and farming (beef and dairy) will have to change if we want to retain that particular myth. The new food reality will hit a food economy that's already dysfunctional in terms of diet-related health, ecology (<a href=\"http://www.fcrn.org.uk/fcrn/publications/how-low-can-we-go\" title=\"\">the food we eat accounts for 30% of the UK's carbon footprint</a>) and social justice.</p> <p>We're not going to like this. There's been an undercurrent of soft-denialism that goes something like this. The weather may be changing but it will be good for us here in northern Europe. It's most often heard around soft fruit or vineyards in \"unusual places\" and almost always has a gallows humour to it. I think we'll be hearing a lot less of this as the realities of globalised food and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/10/english-vineyard-scraps-harvest-weather?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">fundamentally altered weather system</a> come to the fore.</p> <p>With this the notion of \"bounty\" or \"plentitude\" that's deeply imbedded in our understanding may be under challenge. The sense of entitlement wrapped up in a lovely jumble of pagan and Christian symbolism that used to roll together into a vague Thanksgiving will come under question. The cornucopia of living in a fertile land. Now we're more likely to expect ceaseless globalised food from the shelves of 24-hour Tescos. Unacknowledged, food just gushes out, endlessly. Doesn't it?</p> <p>We may have broken the cycle of appreciation long ago and will simply wake up shocked and angry that we can't buy lots of very cheap food. That was our birthright, right? Like houses you could make money off or the certainty of banking, cheap petrol so you can drive anywhere, cheap food \u2013 the notion of abundance \u2013 is the next of our pillars of certainty about to be knocked away.</p> <p>What can we do? We may have to change our thinking about how we do food and farming in response to climate change from one of mitigation to adaptation. We definitely will have to change our model of farming from one of vast mono-crop farms which are heavily dependent on external inputs and highly vulnerable to failure, to more diverse and smaller scale models. That has huge consequences for land ownership, tenancy, planning law and urban agriculture. We'll have to look at much shorter supply chains using less energy and routes and networks that are far less vulnerable to failures and shocks through the system than our vast over-extended globalised food system.</p> <p>We should abandon \"yield\" as the sole metric of farming success. It has its twin in the concept of \"growth\" that has driven western economics to ruin. There are other things we can do to drastically reduce waste. We can eat \"ugly food\", we can stop subsidising biofuels, and we can begin the slow process of wrestling the food system back from big farming, the multiples and the handful of companies that dominate our broken food system. Diversity, open source farming and food sovereignty is the key. It's harvest time, but it's going to cost us all.</p>",
  "<p>The computer hacker collective Anonymous has distanced itself from WikiLeaks, claiming the whistleblowers' site has become too focused on the personal tribulations of its founder, Julian Assange.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/Juxb5M26\" title=\"\">statement</a> posted on the Anonymous Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anonymousirc\" title=\"\">AnonymousIRC</a>, described WikiLeaks as \"the one man Julian Assange show\" after the website began asking users to pay for access to millions of leaked documents.</p> <p>\"The idea behind WikiLeaks was to provide the public with information that would otherwise be kept secret by industries and governments. Information we strongly believe the public has a right to know,\" said the statement on behalf of Anonymous.</p> <p>\"But this has been pushed more and more into the background, instead we only hear about Julian Assange, like he had dinner last night with Lady Gaga. That's great for him but not much of our interest. We are more interested in transparent governments and bringing out documents and information they want to hide from the public.\"</p> <p>Anonymous has long been one of WikiLeaks's most loyal and vocal allies. Supporters bearing Anonymous posters regularly turned out at Assange's public announcements, and members of the group have waged an online campaign against critics of the whistleblowers' site.</p> <p>WikiLeaks said it is funded entirely by donations from members of the public. The site angered some users on Thursday after it made <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/the-gifiles.html\" title=\"\">a donation page automatically appear</a> before it allowed access to leaked documents. Some users are unable to view WikiLeaks material unless they choose to donate money to the site. WikiLeaks said on Twitter that the move was an attempt to counter what it called \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/256585231245664256\" title=\"\">high costs in military courts</a>\".</p> <p>In the statement, Anonymous told its 285,000 followers that WikiLeaks was an \"awesome idea ruined by egos\" and claimed the site had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnonymousIRC/status/256375878001516544\" title=\"\">abandoned the ideals of freedom of expression</a>.</p> <p>The group added: \"We have been worried about the direction WikiLeaks is going for a while. In the recent month the focus moved away from actual leaks and the fight for freedom of information further and further while it concentrated more and more on Julian Assange. It goes without saying that we oppose any plans of extraditing Julian to the USA. He is a content provider and publisher, not a criminal.\"</p> <p>The dispute could starve WikiLeaks of potentially newsworthy leaks in the future, as some of the site's recent disclosures \u2013 including the cache of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/27/wikileaks-stratfor-emails-anonymous\" title=\"\">Stratfor emails</a> \u2013 are alleged to have come from Anonymous.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>11.15am:<strong> Good morning. Amy Lawrence will be online at midday to answer your questions about this weekend's football.</strong></p> <p>San Marino are unlikely to come away with anything other than a heavy defeat tonight. Even Giampaolo Mazza, their likeable manager, is keeping a lid on his expectations: \"The only thing certain is that we will lose,\" he said. \"We will play a very defensive game and try and limit the chances for their strikers. The number of goals [we allow] will depend on our performance and the last few minutes of the game, when we tend to concede more.\"</p> <p>Were San Marino to pull off an almighty shock at Wembley tonight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/10/san-marino-davide-gualtieri-england\">like they did in 1993 by scoring first against England</a>, it would take the bookies by some surprise. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/11/san-marino-england-world-cup-qualifying\">As Sean Ingle has reported, San Marino can be backed at 150-1</a>: \"To put that in context, William Hill offers 100-1 that scientists announce the existence of the Yeti or the Loch Ness monster in the next 12 months.\"</p> <p>England are not facing the most taxing of fixtures, but there are some fascinating encounters taking place elsewhere. Russia host Portugal; Belgium travel to Serbia; and the Republic of Ireland welcome Germany to the Aviva tonight. In a match that could prove critical for both teams and their managers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/11/wales-scotland-chris-coleman-craig-levein\">Scotland play Wales tonight in Cardiff</a>. </p> <p>Here is the full schedule for today's World Cup 2014 qualifiers:</p> <p>Russia v Portugal <br>Finland v Georgia <br>Czech Republic v Malta<br>Faroe Islands v Sweden <br>Kazakhstan v Austria<br>Armenia v Italy<br>Albania v Iceland <br>Turkey v Romania <br>Liechtenstein v Lithuania<br>Moldova v Ukraine<br>Belarus v Spain<br>Bulgaria v Denmark <br>Slovakia v Latvia<br>Switzerland v Norway<br>Macedonia v Croatia <br>Serbia v Belgium <br>Estonia v Hungary <br>Holland v Andorra<br>Greece v Bosnia-Herzegovina<br>Slovenia v Cyprus<br>Republic of Ireland v Germany<br>Wales v Scotland <br>England v San Marino<br>Luxembourg v Israel</p> <p><strong>If you have any questions for Amy, drop them into the comments section below.</strong></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>12.10pm: <strong>Amy is in the comment section answering your questions.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18812664\">Blatantfraud</a> starts things off with a question about UEFA's policy on smaller nations: <strong>\"Amy, can you explain the reasoning behind teams like San Marino and the Faroe Islands being allowed to compete in the major international tournaments?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18813665\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Did you ever notice FIFA's motto is \"for the good of the game?\" Personally I always suspected it might have something to do with for the good of FIFA's bank account. Having a large number of members, some of might feel the need to express their gratitude in times of voting, is surely purely incidental.</p> <p>The inclusion of smaller teams is a double edged sword - on the one hand football should be inclusive and open to all, on the other a more streamlined approach to qualification campaigns (perhaps with pre-qualifiers) makes sense when football is usually dominated by the stronger, richer nations.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>12.16pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18812843\">TranmereSam</a> asks about Wales' goalkeeping situation: <strong>\"Who do you think should start in goal for Wales given that Tranmere's Owain fon Williams is only regular starter of the three goalkeepers called up to the squad? Jason Brown and Lewis Price have two appearances between them this season; fon Williams has managed more than that in a week and is a part of the best defence in his league. Surely he deserves a chance?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18813756\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>My compliments on your analysis of the Welsh goalkeeping situation. I could pretend I have something to add, or be truthful and say that you make a very good case for Fon Williams.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>12.20pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18812996\">CreatureOfTheNight</a> asks about the new England captain: <strong>\"Do you think Wayne Rooney fulfilled his potential?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18813966\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is, perhaps, a distinction to be made between Rooney fulfilling his potential for United, and for England. He is hardly the only player in the last couple of decades for which the question applies as to why it is often a struggle to replicate club form for country. It seems to be the rule rather than the exception with England. I thought Patrick Vieira's comments the other day were interesting \u2013 albeit with a hilarious case of pot calling the kettle black. France's players in the past two finals hardly seemed to be burning with enthusiasm for international football.</p> <p>But more generally, there is an issue where top players who are used to competing for major honours with their club, and playing regularly on the Champions League stage, appear less desperate to be involved and do well than in bygone eras.</p> <p>I wouldn't put Rooney in the category of players who lack passion for playing for England. Not at all. I think he is the type of person who would give everything playing for just about anybody. If he hasn't excelled to his peak, on a consistent basis, for England, that perhaps has more to do with the weird pressures England players put themselves under, and the team's general inhibitions.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>12.24pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18813166\">Pabloelbrujo</a> asks about Sunderland's new winger: <strong>\"Now that Adam Johnson has moved to the North East do you think he will be picked for England again?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814037\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Adam Johnson? Maybe he will get another chance, but arguably he would have been better off moving to the Liverpool area to catch the eye of Roy Hodgson. I expect if he can put together three months of solidly effective performances he will come back into the reckoning.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>12.27pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18813641\">CredeSigno</a> asks: <strong>\"Given how nationalistic the Russian press are, how has Fabio Capello's failure to speak Russian gone down with them? Assume it's not as much of an issue as was made out to be by certain sections of the English press?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814168\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Interesting point. But given the number of overseas coaches Russia have employed recently \u2013 and I would be surprised if any of them got a handle of anything other than rudimentary Russian \u2013 I expect the press are used to it. They haven't had a domestic coach since 2006, at which point Guus Hiddink and then Dick Advocaat took control. I am very curious to see how the relationship between Russia and Don Fabio pans out.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>12.30pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18813813\">CredeSigno</a> asks: <strong>\"Is Group E of the European section of the World Cup qualifiers the dullest group ever?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814244\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Maybe. But are you really that excited about group G?</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>12.39pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18813928\">CredeSigno</a> asks: <strong>\"Amy, did you laugh when you heard Craig Levein claim Scotland could still qualify if they don't beat Wales?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814393\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>What are the hopes for Scotland and Wales supporters for this qualification campaign? Not just in terms of results or positions, but in terms of where the country's football is going or could hope to go? Being realistic, it is hard to see a successful finish from a group with Croatia, Serbia and Belgium in it.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.42pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814365\">promisinglight</a> asks: <strong>\"What's your take on Ilomb\u00e9 Mboyo's inclusion in the Belgian squad?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814588\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Re Mboyo, it is clearly an incredibly complex situation. I do suggest you take a listen to what Paul Doyle had to say about this case on Football Weekly if you have a chance. It seems Mboyo was a talented player, but a conviction for a violent rape at the age of 16, and a prison sentence, obviously put a stop to football. He claims to have had an epiphany in prison, acknowledging the horrors he was responsible for, and got a second chance at his career. His call up for Belgium has been a complicated one, with people across the moral spectrum arguing that he should be included, absolutely shouldn't be included, and plenty in between.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.49pm: On the subject of qualifying, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814813\">Amy adds</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I had an email from Ryan Dunne with the following point...<br>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> I liked the recent point on the pod about the poor scheduling of international qualification games. Practically speaking, would there any way of having a summer qualification jamboree? I'd maintain that such a tournament would be more, not less likely, to garner attention and fill stadiums, but I suppose an argument could be made that the current system, although drawn out, does mean that teams won't suffer unnecessarily if (for example) their star player is out with a month-long injury. </blockquote> <p>I suspect if you did a straw poll of club managers, from major clubs, they would be rushing to sign up for a close season tournament in which all qualifiers were done. Even international managers often complain that it is difficult to get any work done with players over the limited time they currently get with their players. It would be positive in terms of a fresh level of interest and a momentum, and allow top players to do less travelling during the season. It would probably reduce the number of players called up, though, as over the course of an 18 month qualification campaign now, managers inevitably chop and change according to who is fit and in form. A condensed summer qualification would presumably have one squad throughout.<br></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>12.56pm: MrKiddon asks about tonight's game at the Aviva: <strong>\"Do you think that if Ireland get smashed against Germany (which will happen) Trappatoni will be sacked or resign. If he does get the boot, who should Ireland get as a new manager?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18814986\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't think Trap will walk, but there may be very persuasive pressure on the FAI to act. They may even feel compelled to hire somebody cheaper soon enough, as results and performances are not currently justifying a big salary. It is a pity that Trap's spell with Ireland has taken such a dip. His first couple of years, in getting the team organised and achieving qualification for the Euros, was impressive. The team sheet against Germany is worrying, though.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>1.06pm: Thanks for your comments and questions. Amy has now signed off.</p> <p>For some additional reading this afternoon, we have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/12/world-cup-qualifiers-10-things\">Golden Generation special in today's 10 things to look forward to in the World Cup qualifiers</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/12/joy-of-six-sports-stars-adverts\">Sean Ingle's Joy of Six on sports stars in adverts</a> is also worth a read.</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/11/edgar-davids-barnet\">here is some unlikely Edgar Davids news.</a></p>",
  "<p>More than a third of the UK's 150 top online retailers have been told to change their websites or face action from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) after it found them to be in potential breach of consumer protection laws.</p> <p>The watchdog has written to 62 retailers after an investigation uncovered various online wrongdoings, including imposing unreasonable restrictions on people's rights to a refund and adding unexpected extra charges at the check-out.</p> <p>The 62 came from a \"web sweep\" of the top 100 online retailers selling to UK consumers and 57 top clothing retailers. The top 100 includes giants such as Amazon, Argos, Tesco, Next and John Lewis.</p> <p>The sweep looked in particular at potential breaches of the distance selling regulations which are designed to protect consumers when they shop online or enter into other contracts at a distance from the supplier.</p> <p>The most common breach of rules on refunds was a requirement that the product must be in the original packaging or condition when returned. Although shoppers have to make sure goods are in a reasonable condition when they are returned, retailers cannot always insist they be in the original packaging because this can infringe on the buyer's rights to reasonably assess the product.</p> <p>Of the websites the OFT looked at, 60% only provided a web contact form rather than an email contact address, which is a breach of e-commerce regulations; 2% provided no electronic contact at all.</p> <p>A quarter of the websites added unexpected charges to the price of goods at the checkout. These included things such as credit card and delivery charges.</p> <p>\"The OFT recognises that most businesses want to play fair with their customers and to comply with the law,\" said Cavendish Elithorn, senior director of the goods and consumer group at the OFT. \"We encourage all online retailers to check their websites so customers can be confident their rights are being respected when they shop online.\"</p> <p>The OFT or local trading standards can take action against retailers who do not make amendments to their websites, including imposing a fine.</p>",

The good news is that Cert means energy suppliers must offer free or discounted loft and cavity wall insulation to some or all of their customers.</p> <p>The energy companies must only meet their obligations under Cert until the end of 2012 and some of them have already closed applications. SSE is one of these, as is Scottish Power. Others such as EDF are offering it to those in receipt of child tax credits where their annual household income is less than \u00a316,190, or to anyone claiming pension credit. To qualify for the EDF offer you don't have to be an EDF customer, but you do have to apply before the end of October.</p> <p>For everyone else, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/aug/30/free-loft-insulation-british-gas\" title=\"Free loft insulation from British Gas  what's the catch?\">British Gas is offering free insulation to all households</a> \u2013 not just those on low incomes \u2013 who apply before the end of November. There are, of course, some terms and conditions: the insulation is only available if you have less than 60mm of loft insulation already in place (but that is quite possible if your home was insulated a while ago), and the insulation has to cover at least a third of your loft or wall space. There is also an upper limit of 120 metres squared, which is roughly the size of a four-bed detached home.</p> <p>In all cases work has to be carried out by the end of the year under Cert rules.</p> <p><strong>Potential saving</strong> Up to \u00a3175 a year (for a gas-heated three-bed semi).</p> <h2>Swallow the cost and change your boiler</h2> <p>Boilers account for about 60% of your total energy spend in a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust, so an efficient one makes a big difference.</p> <p>The major downside, of course, is it can cost a typical \u00a32,300 to have one installed, but if your boiler is ancient or you are forever paying to get it fixed now could be the time to replace it with an A-rated one. The Energy Saving Trust has a <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Electricals/Energy-Saving-Trust-Recommended-products\" title=\"Energy Saving Trust Recommended \">list of recommended boilers</a> and can help with finding an installer.</p> <p>People in Scotland can take advantage of <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/scotland/Heating-and-hot-water/Replacing-your-boiler/Boiler-Scrappage-Scheme\" title=\"Boiler Scrappage Scheme\">the Scottish boiler scrappage scheme</a>, which entitles them to a \u00a3400 voucher towards a new boiler. A similar scheme ran in England and Wales but is now closed.</p> <p><strong>Potential saving</strong> \u00a3300 a year (if you switch from a G-rated to an A-rated boiler).</p> <h2>Switch suppliers and look outside the mainstream</h2> <p>Although people are often loathe to switch suppliers, fearing hassle and little benefit, you could <a href=\"http://www.guardianenergycomparison.co.uk/guardian_editorial\" title=\"Guardian Money Deals\">save hundreds of pounds</a> if you are someone who has never switched and are on your supplier's most expensive tariff paying by the most expensive method.</p> <p>It is also worth looking beyond the mainstream suppliers. According to TheEnergyShop.com, three of the five cheapest tariffs come from two of the smallest suppliers, First Utility and Ovo Energy.</p> <p>First Utility's iSave v12 variable costs the typical household \u00a31,054 a year. For certainty that prices will not move for a year, a fixed rate is a good option. One of the cheapest is Ovo Energy's New Energy Fix tariff at \u00a31,088 a year, though this is not available in Scotland.</p> <p>Co-operative Energy, a newcomer to the market, has announced it is committing to freezing prices until at least April 2013. Its average standard tariff is \u00a31,166. This is the same price for customers, regardless of the mthod used to pay their bills.</p> <p><strong>Potential saving</strong> \u00a3300 a year (if you move from the most expensive tariff in the country to the cheapest).</p> <h2>Manage your bills better</h2> <p>Take regular meter readings \u2013 if your gas and electricity meters aren't read regularly, bills based on estimated readings mean you could end up paying for much more than you actually use.</p> <p>Also consider changing your method of payment, as you pay more for using cash or cheque each month. Switch to monthly direct debit and you could save a typical 10%. However, you need to keep an eye on how much your supplier is debiting compared to your actual bills. You can end up vastly in credit and your supplier won't pay you back unless you ask. If a credit has accumulated and you request the money back, suppliers must refund it unless they have a very good reason not to.</p> <p>Another advantage of paying by direct debit is you can often choose the date of payment, so you can arrange it to coincide with pay day.</p> <p><strong>Potential saving</strong> Up to \u00a3100 a year.</p> <h2>Change your approach to energy consumption</h2> <p>Turn your heating and hot water thermostats down. Reducing your room temperature by 1\u00b0C could cut your heating bills by up to 10%, and typically saves about \u00a360 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. It says your hot water cylinder thermostat should be set at 60\u00b0C. Close your curtains at dusk to stop heat escaping through the windows and check for draughts around windows and doors.

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=munMGzeqCQE\" title=\"\">1) Brazil's footballers at the airport, Nike (1998)</a></h2> <p>Ronaldo. Romario. Roberto Carlos. A joyous kickabout through Rio de Janeiro airport. Sergio Mendes' Mas Que Nada oba-oba-oba-ing in the background. And John Woo in the director's chair. What's not to like? Admittedly when the advert was shown on near-permanent loop during France 98, you may have wanted to volley <em>jogo bonito</em> into a certain Oregon-based multinational's swoosh, but with 14 years' distance it's hard not to be warmed by its tricks, flicks and sheer sunniness.</p> <p>The advert was shot at short notice during the Christmas holidays when Brazil's players, temporarily away from their clubs, could be rounded up. Equipment was delayed due to trucks getting flat tyres. Players turned up late \u2013 seven hours late in Ronaldo's case. And no one in the airport wanted them there. But despite the challenges, it all came together. <a href=\"http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug98/nike/pg1.htm\" title=\"\">Speaking to the American Society of Cinematographers</a> in August 1998, the director of photography Gale Tattersall said: \"I can't tell you how chaotic it was shooting during the holiday in an airport where nobody wanted us. If you need something in Brazil, it's three days away or that office is closed for the month.\"</p> <p>The advert was shot primarily in a private VIP departure lounge and Varig Airlines' maintenance hangers. \"They'd heard horror stories about lights melting airplane windows, and didn't want us wheeling any lights near their planes,\" explained Tattersall, with a chuckle.</p> <p>But how were they able to capture the players' speed and energy? \"The Steadicam operator, Jeff Mart \u2026 has this amazing ability to wear a Steadicam and ride a bicycle using only one side of the handlebars,\" said Tattersall. \"He can literally drop the bike, get off and start walking \u2026 I recall one shot in particular where he placed the camera at a very low angle and steered his bike toward a player just as the ball was kicked.\"</p> <p>Woo, meanwhile, was able to make the shoot appear natural by the simple act of making them laugh. \"I had lots of moments to make them look great by photographing teasing smiles and childlike actions. Although we all came from so many different backgrounds, we ended up playing like kids, which added a lot of humour to the commercial.\"</p> <p>There were fewer smiles when the extent of Nike's deal with the Brazilian FA was teased out \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/jan/11/newsstory.sport2\" title=\"\">which included contractual clauses</a> allowing it to choose Brazil's opposition for certain friendlies and insist on the participation of eight first-teamers. Still, it would be churlish not to acknowledge Nike as being particularly good at these pre-big tournament adverts, with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOM1k4oLGJU\" title=\"\">Good v Evil</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXL3_rZAWQM\" title=\"\">the Mission</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DB10a6CUHU\" title=\"\">the Secret Tournament</a> being particular highlights.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf-4Gbqyni4\" title=\"\">2) Kevin Keegan and Henry Cooper, Brut 33 (1976)</a></h2> <p>At 8.12pm on 22 September 1955, the first advertisement on UK television \u2013 for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuEwsEiSp8\" title=\"\">Gibbs SR Toothpaste</a> \u2013 was shown.</p> <blockquote> It's tingling fresh! It's fresh as ice! It's Gibbs SR Toothpaste \u2014 the tingling fresh toothpaste that does your gums good too. The tingle you get when you brush with SR is much more than a nice taste \u2014 it's a tingle of health \u2026 Gibbs SR! </blockquote> <p>It was an innocent message, for more innocent times. Sport-themed adverts rarely diverted from the template. <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/VeryShort1950s-eraCommercialForwheaties\" title=\"\">This one</a> promoting Wheaties \u2013 \"the breakfast of champions\" \u2013 is typical.</p> <p>So what to make of Kevin Keegan and Henry Cooper, sweating and thrusting in tight shorts before enjoying Brut 33 in the showers? Sure, the dialogue sounds innocent enough \u2026</p> <blockquote> <strong>Kevin:</strong> Good workout today, 'Enry! <br> <strong>Henry:</strong> And after a good workout \u2026 <br> <strong>Kevin:</strong> \u2026 nothing beats the good smell of Brut \u2026 <br> <strong>Henry:</strong> 'Ere, are you trying to muscle in on my act? <br> <strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, why don't you throw in the towel, 'Enry? <br> <strong>Henry:</strong> Gurrr! Brut 33 \u2014 the deodorant with muscle! </blockquote> <p>\u2026 but Keegan seems to deliberately camp it up, resting his elbow on Cooper's shoulder before showing the former boxer a playful fist after a towel is flicked in his face. Just a clever way of selling a product \u2013 deodorant \u2013 that many men regarded with as much suspicion as women's lib? Or perhaps something altogether more radical: sport's answer to David Bowie and Mick Ronson's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muMcWMKPEWQ\" title=\"\">Starman on Top of the Pops</a>?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oACRt-Qp-s\" title=\"\">3) Michael Jordan and Larry Bird's 'The Showdown' for McDonald's (1993)</a></h2> <p><em>\"What's in the bag?\"</em></p> <p><em>\"Nuttin'. Big Mac, fries\"</em></p> <p><em>\"Play you for it.\"</em></p> <p><em>\"You and me, for my Big Mac?\"</em></p> <p><em>\"First one to miss watches the winner eat. No dunking.\"</em></p> <p>The concept is ridiculous \u2013 two multimillionaires playing horse for a soggy Big Mac and limp fries \u2013 but, incredibly, it's not half as ridiculous as Jordan's attire, an ugly graffiti of blue and black jaggedy bits mixed with red and yellow squiggles. It was if the world's greatest ever basketball player told staff at his favourite burger joint: forget the bun, squirt that mustard and ketchupy goodness on my T-shirt. There! There! And there! Not that Bird has anything to be proud of: he's wearing a vest and clearly hasn't shaved the hairs on his back.</p> <p>Still, no one was watching His Airness v His Hairyness for fashion tips \u2013 just the increasingly extravagant, and amusing, attempts to score.</p> <p>\"Every detail was worked out,\" <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">explained Jim Ferguson</a>, who was part of the team behind the ad, in 2010. \"We actually had to have Larry challenge Michael to the game because we couldn't have Michael make the challenge because of his gambling situation at the time \u2026 Larry added the line, 'No dunking.' Then the two took the first two shots (over the backboard and on their knees). After that, it was just editing though Larry didn't necessarily want to do it that way. When the two of them are in the stands and Larry challenges Michael, Larry was actually trying to figure out if he could really make it off the scoreboard.\"</p> <p>The advert, first broadcast during the Super Bowl, almost didn't hit the air. \"At the last second our lawyers realised we didn't have commercial clearance to use the Hancock Building,\" said Ferguson. \"Eventually I think we traded to the rights to use it for a basketball autographed by Jordan and Bird and I think $100. Nobody ever thought it would turn into what it did.\"</p> <p>A follow-up <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC6wh1-ni4c\" title=\"\">was aired a year later</a>, featuring Charles Barkley, the grand canyon, and space. \"I got an idea,\" says Larry. \"First person to miss has to watch the other eat two Big Macs.\" Once again, it's worth following along for the ride.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo0ncg-2zPY\" title=\"\">4) Shaquille O'Neal plays by his own rules, ESPN (2008)</a></h2> <p>Another basketball legend, another classic advert. On a road trip in their rusty camper van, ESPN presenters Mike Breen and Stuart Scott are playing Scrabble with Shaquille O'Neal. As you do. But it's Scrabble like you've never seen before. After the camera pans to the board \u2013 which has the words 'shaqattack', 'shaqalici', 'shaquesque' and, yes, 'shaqfu' on it \u2013 Shaq is asked: \"How do you get so many qs?\"</p> <p>\"Don't worry about it,\" replies Shaq with the understated menace of Kathy Bates in Misery. \"My turn again.\"</p> <p>A year later O'Neal appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live <a href=\"http://www.boreme.com/posting.php?id=23950#.UHfO1VEYImo\" title=\"\">and played Scrabble while being interviewed.</a> Sadly for aficionados, Shaq's knowledge of the rules and his word-playing skills suggested that he's not spending retirement thumbing through Chambers Official Scrabble Words International to learn high-scoring plays like dzo, faqir and sheqalim by rote. More fool him.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKnRqgOul_w\" title=\"\">5) Joe Frazier and Edie Adams, Muriel cigars (1971)</a></h2> <p>Every week we remind readers that Joy of Six doesn't seek to be definitive; its purpose isn't to rank sporting events, but enjoy them. That bears repetition, particularly here. It's only right to acknowledge that when sports stars appear in adverts the result is often cheesier than Vernon Kay at a Stilton convention. Or just plain bad. Take <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_PmcaYHYLk&amp;sns=em\" title=\"\">this karate-tinged commercial</a> for Puma starring Vinnie Jones, Robert Pires and Nicolas Anelka. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nyvVP5eooQ&amp;sns=em\" title=\"\">Ronaldinho doing this</a> while eating a yoghurt. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHkqN52xqD4&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen\" title=\"\">Joe Frazier crooning for the Miller Lite dollar</a>.

Gaze open-jawed as Adams's racy of version 'Hey Big Spender!' suddenly cuts to an awkward Frazier sitting on his mother's knee, announcing \"I've just spent 200 grand on a house for my favourite girl\". His mother replies \"Have a Muriel son, but don't get the ashes on the rug\", and then, bizarrely, the commercial finishes with Adams top-noting Big Spender again. A truly awful effort all round, with production values that make L!VE TV look like a lavish HBO mini-series.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJK0P2VqFVo\" title=\"\">6) Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and the big friendly bear Gol TV (2010)</a></h2> <p>Just when you thought you couldn't love Andr\u00e9s Iniesta any more, he appeared in an advert with a big, growly, cuddly bear. After accidentally injuring the bear after kicking a rock into some bushes, the Barcelona midfielder decides to take care of it and the pair become best friends. They meditate and run together before Andr\u00e9s gets his buddy a very special present for Christmas. And that's it, really. But you'd need a heart of stone not to enjoy it.</p> <p>The Guardian's Spanish football correspondent, Sid Lowe, flags up three other commercials worthy of your time \u2013 Alfredo Di Stefano, Fernando Torres, Pep Guardiola, Mario Kempes and others <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7m5Nb3V8Ck\" title=\"\">talking beer and football</a>; Spanish footballers' dads playing football and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FoO89V3kcY&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">then having a beer with their famous sons</a>, and Iker Casillas, Fernando Torres, Joaquin and others <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMnlORJeH_c\" title=\"\">in a beer advert</a>.

  "<p>I first heard the name of Alan Bennett at an Oxford dining table in the late 1950s. I lived in an ecumenical Unitarian college, and one of my fellow-boarders told me he had tutorials with an extraordinary junior history lecturer who did a famous routine as a comic vicar. I saw that for myself when, in August 1960, I was part of the audience at the brilliantly shambolic first night of <em>Beyond the Fringe</em> at the Edinburgh festival. Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore all radiated the extrovert exuberance of practised performers, but the eye was constantly drawn to the figure of Bennett, who, with his heavy specs and boyish trim, resembled a sprightly young curate on vacation. Few would have predicted that the shyest of the quartet would end up, half a century later, as a popular playwright and a national institution. Or even a National Theatre institution, with another new play, <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/people\" title=\"\"><em>People</em></a>, opening there on 31 October.</p> <p>In the mid-1960s Bennett was chiefly famous for the sketches and parodies he wrote and performed for TV programmes such as <em>The Late Show</em> and <em>On the Margin</em>. At the time he anxiously disclaimed the title of Swiftian satirist (\"Swift, as far as I know,\" he once wrote, \"never had to come on after the male dancers\"). And indeed it was hard to see any darker purpose behind sketches such as one in which Bennett sashayed on as a camp antique dealer and enthusiastically announced: \"I've just been stripping a tallboy.\" But, at his best, Bennett hinted he might become the Max Beerbohm of the electronic age. One of his most lethally funny sketches (reprinted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780571232413/writing-home\" title=\"\"><em>Writing Home</em></a>) skewered all those TV documentaries in which pain-filled northern writers return to their roots and are pictured romantically against slag-heaps: \"We were all miners in our family,\" says a ruggedly duffle-coated Bennett. \"My father was a miner. My mother is a miner. These are miner's hands but we were all artists, I suppose, really. But I was the first one who had the urge to express myself on paper rather than at the coalface. But, under the skin, I suppose I'm still a miner. I suppose, in a very real sense, I'm a miner writer.\"</p> <p>That parodic talent found its outlet in Bennett's exhilarating ragbag of a play, <em>Forty Years On</em>, which became an instant hit in 1968 with John Gielgud in the lead. Since then, however, a number of myths have accumulated about Bennett that I would like to puncture. One is that he is essentially a naturalistic dramatist, when he strikes me as someone who restlessly experiments with different forms as if trying to find the perfect vehicle for his ideas. Another myth is that Bennett is what John Sutherland has called one of \"England's cultural teddy bears\" in the manner of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/john-betjeman\" title=\"\">John Betjeman</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/jb-priestley\" title=\"\">JB Priestley</a>. Whatever we have made of him, Bennett's recent work, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/29/theatre\" title=\"\"><em>The History Boys</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/18/alan-bennett-the-habit-of-art\" title=\"\"><em>The Habit of Art</em></a> and the novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/24/smut-unseemly-stories-alan-bennett-review\" title=\"\"><em>Smut</em></a>, suggests a distinctly uncosy talent. And, although Bennett himself has always denied he has any social or political agenda, over-arching themes and patterns certainly emerge from his work. Isaiah Berlin famously divided writers into foxes, who know many things, and hedgehogs, who know one big thing. Bennett, I suspect, is a bit of a hedgehog, with a hint of the prickliness that implies.</p> <p>To start with form, the mad idea that Bennett is a naturalistic writer may have been fostered by his TV plays; although even here people conveniently forget <em>The Old Crowd</em> (1979), which, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121208/never.apologise\" title=\"\">Lindsay Anderson</a>'s production, became a house-warming party stripped of any actual furniture. But from the beginning, Bennett's stage plays have consistently upended theatrical conventions.</p> <p>In the case of <em>Forty Years On</em>, this may have been a matter of convenience, in that Bennett was searching for a form that could contain a number of existing sketches. What he hit on was a complex play-within-a-play-within-a-play. We are supposedly in Albion House watching a school play, in which the memories of a pair of wartime Bloomsberries (essentially Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West) trigger a number of parodic setpieces encapsulating the early 20th century. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/27/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Martin Esslin</a>, reviewing it in Plays and Players, perceptively pointed out the similarities between <em>Forty Years On</em> and Peter Weiss's radically experimental <em>Marat/Sade</em>. Both show history presented by inmates of an institution, both use song as a source of narration, both show a conflict between opposing worldviews: in Bennett's case, between a firmly traditionalist headmaster and his successor, hungry for change. Any idea that Esslin's comparison is far-fetched is scotched by Bennett's own admission that he was partly inspired by a Polish play, <em>The Glorious Resurrection of Our Lord</em>, that he saw at the 1967 World Theatre Season and which featured choirboys singing above a stage-wide screen.</p> <p>But most of Bennett's theatrical work, with the exception of <em>Getting On</em>, is an attempt to escape the comforting paraphernalia of realism. One of my favourite early Bennetts, <em>Habeas Corpus</em> (1973), is a farce shorn of all the usual doors, windows, beds and conventional hiding-places. In both form and content, it strikes me as far more outr\u00e9 than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/orton\" title=\"\">Joe Orton</a>'s <em>What the Butler Saw</em>. What it does is take a group of McGill seaside-postcard stereotypes \u2013 lecherous GP, mountainous wife, flat-chested wallflower, unfired canon \u2013 and propel them onwards and upwards in a spiral of sex and death. It also disproves an old myth by showing that farce can be physically hectic and verbally funny at the same time: \"Have you ever been called to serve the Lord in heathen parts?\" the canon is asked in the midst of the whirling action. \"Well,\" he replies, \"I was for a short time a curate in Leeds.\"</p> <p>Even when Bennett looks as if he is resorting to realism, it turns out to be deceptive. In <em>Enjoy</em>, greeted with total bewilderment in 1980 and transports of delight in Christopher Luscombe's 2008 revival, Bennett shows us a fractious family in the last back-to-back in Leeds. But it transpires that the house is to be transported to a museum as an embodiment of working-class culture and that its occupants are, to a large extent, acting out the roles expected of them by social observers. This reaches its apogee in the scene in which a pretentious neighbour says, after the dad of the house has supposedly died, that \"the first thing to do is lay him out in the customary manner\". As the body is ceremonially stripped and washed, the whole scene becomes a parody of Lawrentian realism that is punctured only when the prostrate figure visibly and vitally stiffens.</p> <p>The idea of Bennett as teddy bear may, I suspect, stem from those TV documentaries in which he explores his Leeds origins or hovers round Harrogate hotel lobbies; perhaps even from his sympathetic reading of children's classics such as <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>. I've only met Bennett on a couple of occasions, but there is clearly a sharp edge beneath the Yorkshire charm. You only have to read his diaries to see that, underneath the wit and humour and sandwich-filled pottering around old churches, there is a deep resentment at what has happened to England in his lifetime and an instinctive distrust, sometimes amounting to deep loathing, of most politicians. Listening, for instance, to Alan Clark and Kenneth Clarke talking on the radio about the arrest of General Pinochet in 1998, he writes: \"Both have that built-in shrug characteristic of 80s Conservatism, electrodes on the testicles a small price to pay when economic recovery's at stake.\"</p> <p>As a playwright, he is also less cosy than he seems. In the most famous of the TV <em>Talking Heads</em> series (another formal experiment), Bennett shows a woman driven by desperate loneliness and frustration to seek sexual consolation in a bed of lentils at the back of a grocer's shop. In <em>Kafka's Dick</em> (1986), in which the famous dead mingle with the inconspicuous living, Bennett attacks the way we turn artists' lives into myths and suggests we have only Kafka's word for it that his father was a repugnant monster. Far from being cuddly, Bennett also consistently questions conventional moral attitudes to man-boy relationships in a way that is undeniably provocative.</p> <p>As far back as <em>Forty Years On</em>, there is a confirmation-class scene that ends in the chaplain making a mild pass at a pupil: the outrage it provokes in the play's headmaster has frequently been repeated in real life, leading to the episode being cut from school productions. Hector, the hero of <em>The History Boys</em>, also habitually gropes his 17-year-old pupil's genitals but is not overtly condemned by his author. I&#xa0;take Bennett's point to be that inspirational teachers are often flawed human beings and that boys of that age are capable of exercising responsibility: indeed he once said in an interview: \"Hector is the child, not them.\" And in <em>The Habit of Art</em> Bennett showed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/wh-auden\" title=\"\">WH Auden</a> relied on the mechanical services of rent-boys and that Britten's art was inseparable from his romantic, if unconsummated, attachment to boys. I don't think for a moment that Bennett is blandly licensing or endorsing paedophilia: what he does is raise disturbing questions, guaranteed to rattle the Mrs Grundys of this world, about its provenance and its possible consequences.</p> <p>Neither settled in form nor conventional in outlook, Bennett is a complex writer. And, although his choice of subject is diverse \u2013 ranging from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/24/madness-of-george-iii-review\" title=\"\">George III's madness</a> to Kafka's physical endowments \u2013 he comes back time and again to certain themes: the matter of England and the nature of art. The two aren't always easily separable, but it's fair to say that the state of the nation, and the quality of its life, is never far from the forefront of Bennett's mind. It often seems as if he is using drama to explore his own contradictory attitudes to the subject.</p> <p>That's certainly true of <em>Forty Years On</em>, which I once described as a piece of radical nostalgia and which gains its vitality from the tension between Bennett's ambivalent attitude to the past. He deftly punctures and parodies Bloomsbury affectation, Buchanite snobbery and the moral cowardice of 1930s Chamberlainite appeasers. Yet at the same time there is something heartfelt, as well as poetic, to the climactic threnody in which the headmaster laments the changing of England: \"The hedges come down from the silent fields. The lease is out on the corner site. A butterfly is an event.\" Not unlike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/johnosborne\" title=\"\">John Osborne</a>, Bennett emerges as a writer who believes in progress but who is irrevocably attached to his country's cultural inheritance; and it's specifically England, rather than Britain, that stirs his deepest sympathy.</p> <p>One way of looking at one's country, of course, is from the perspective of exile, which Bennett does in the rarely revived <em>The Old Country</em> (1977). On one level, the play is about the wistful regret of a traitor, Hilary, who, from the vantage point of his Soviet dacha, deplores the loss of Lyons Corner Houses, changes to the Book of Common Prayer, the decline of the country-house thriller. His sexually duplicitous, establishment brother-in-law reinforces the theme by claiming that it \"is sad to find oneself so often striking the elegiac note when one is by temperament and inclination a modernist\". But Bennett shows another face of England at the play's end, when Hilary is sent home, as part of a spy-swap, while a working-class traitor is left permanently and unhappily marooned in Moscow. Privilege, Bennett implies, still operates even in the world of espionage.</p> <p>But, if nationhood is one of Bennett's persistent themes, so is the nature of art. I see Bennett's whole output as an attempt to demystify art, in the broadest sense, and to suggest that it is neither the exclusive property of a self-perpetuating elite nor something that is an endless source of pain to its practitoners. One of his earliest sketches, <em>Tit for Tatti</em>, is a very funny account of a pilgrim's visit to the Tuscan retreat of the great art collector Bernard Berenson: \"It is twenty years since I had been at I Tatti,\" he cries, which, in Bennett's drawling tones, inevitably came out as \"arty-tarty\". Bennett's whole career has been a campaign against the arty-tarty and the idea that art and literature are available only to the members of a privileged club. In that minor masterpiece, <em>A Question of Attribution</em>, the real sympathy lies not with that Marxist aesthete <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/15/firstchapters.whitbreadbookawards2002\" title=\"\">Anthony Blunt</a>, nor even with the shrewdly perceptive Queen, but with Blunt's modest interrogator, Chubb, who wants to acquire the basics of art appreciation.</p> <p>Bennett also attacks the idea of the artist as the kind of ravaged, tormented genius so often enshrined in biography. That's what <em>Kafka's Dick</em> is really about, since the hero, suddenly appearing in the suburban home of one of his acolytes, turns out not to be the earthly saint he had expected. And it's what <em>The Habit of Art</em> is almost entirely about, since it strips Auden of the grandeur and nobility the actor impersonating him craves and shows Britten to exist in a state of nervous thraldom to the bullying poet. Although not one of my favourite Bennett plays \u2013 too much scaffolding, not enough building \u2013 <em>The Habit of Art</em> does indeed suggest that the work matters more than the life, and that art is the product of persistence, tenacity and application.</p> <p>All that applies to Bennett himself. He may, as I say, have become a bit of an institution, but I hope we can dismiss all the \"national treasure\" nonsense. Through innate talent, wide reading, a certain wry detachment and, above all, an ability to listen to how people talk, he has become a very good, extremely complicated playwright. <em>People</em> is likely to be formally adventurous, faintly disruptive and with something to say about human oddity and the nature of life in our strange little country: what a Bennett character once dubbed \"a valuable site at the crossroads of the world\".</p> <p><em>\u2022 People</em> is at the National Theatre, London SE1, from 31 October to 9 February 2013. <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">nationaltheatre.org.uk</a></p>",

The npower increase will affect approximately 3 million customers.</p> <h2><strong>I am not a British Gas or nPower customer \u2013 should I worry?</strong></h2> <p>SSE has already announced a 9% increase in both gas and electricity prices, beginning on 15 October. It is widely anticipated the remaining energy suppliers that make up the \"big six\" will soon follow suit.</p> <p>E.ON has a price freeze in place until the end of the year but has refused to rule out an increase after that; Scottish Power and EDF are expected to apply increases in the next two months.</p> <p>All households should therefore check their tariff and search the market to see if they can save money elsewhere, and consider fixing.</p> <h2><strong>Who is offering the best deals?</strong></h2> <p>The best deals now come from one company, First Utility. Its online variable rate tariff, <a href=\"http://www.first-utility.com/\" title=\"First Utility website\">iSave v12</a>, will cost a typical household \u00a31,054 a year; it's cheapest fixed-rate tariff, iSave Fixed v4, which sets prices until March 2014, costs \u00a31,087.</p> <p>\"Consumers wishing to take advantage of First Utility's offer should switch now,\" says Mark Todd, director of price comparison service Energyhelpline.com. \"It's not clear how long this offer will be around and market predictions show price increases are likely to be imposed by the UK's leading energy suppliers.\" However, First Utility charges a \u00a330 per fuel exit penalty for those who sign up to its fixed tariff but leave before March 2014.</p> <p>The next cheapest fixed-rate deal is the <a href=\"http://www.ovoenergy.com/our-energy/\" title=\"Ovo website\">New Energy Fix</a> tariff from Ovo Energy, at \u00a31,088 a year. It is not available in Scotland and comes with \u00a330 per fuel early exit penalties.</p> <p>Experts advise people concerned about bills to opt for the certainty of a fixed-rate tariff, especially as price rises from other providers are expected.</p> <p>You can compare energy prices on <a href=\"http://www.guardianenergycomparison.co.uk/guardian_editorial\" title=\"Guardian Money deals\">the Guardian's money deals page</a>.</p> <h2><strong>I'm worried about getting into debt as my bills are high</strong></h2> <p>You are not alone. Debt advice charity the <a href=\"http://www.moneyadvicetrust.org/\" title=\"Money Advice Trust\">Money Advice Trust</a> says its National Debtline phone service took 2,403 calls from people with energy arrears in September \u2013 that's a call every six minutes the lines were open.</p> <p>So far this year 16% of people calling National Debtline have energy arrears, a record which eclipses 2011's 13.7% and the 2.7% seen in 2004. Spokesman Paul Crayston says he expects 2012 to represent the biggest year-on-year jump in energy debt calls, both in terms of total calls and proportion.</p> <p>With the UN warning of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/un-rising-food-costs-weather\" title=\"UN warns of rising food costs after year's extreme weather\">food price rises to come</a>, it is clear many will be plunged into debt or face a cold winter.</p> <h2><strong>I'm already struggling with my bills. What should I do?</strong></h2> <p>Gas and electricity companies can cut off your supply in a few weeks if you don't pay them \u2013 no court is involved in this decision \u2013 so these bills should therefore be treated as a priority debt. Contact your provider as soon as possible and ask to pay them every week, every two weeks or every month if that makes things more manageable.</p> <p>If you have arrears, phone or write to the company and ask for a payment arrangement. Be careful not to offer to pay more than you can afford. All fuel companies should agree, under their code of practice, to accept an offer of repayment in instalments at a rate you can manage.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u2022 Who will be resitting exams in November?</strong></p> <p>Any student who sat their GCSE English exam last summer and \"cashed in\" their award (ie finished all the modules needed to complete their GCSE) was eligible to apply to resit in November.

  "<p>Communities secretary Eric Pickles chose the Conservative party conference on Monday to launch his latest policy to \"stop caravans in their tracks\". The announcement was Pickles response to last year's Dale Farm confrontation, where Basildon council completed decade-long proceedings to evict Travellers occupying pitches without planning consent. Never again, he promised, would local authorities have to spend a fortune in time and money enforcing planning law against the Traveller community.</p> <p>There are approximately 5,000 council pitches and a further 8,500 privately owned pitches in England, so we do have legitimate places for our 13,500 travelling families. The only problem is that there are actually more than 18,000 caravans in use by the Gypsy and Traveller community \u2013 leaving a significant number of people with no legal right to set up home.</p> <p>Planning applications for new sites are nearly always opposed, even by those living a long away from the land under consideration. Just the mention of a possibility of a new site in an area will often inspire a local petition and an action group.</p> <p>Local press will give front page coverage to the campaign to stop this new development and resistance to this possible \"damage\" to the local community will be fuelled. Very rarely will the objectors have first hand knowledge of the community and many of their fears are fuelled by stereotypical assumptions. It sometimes feels as if Gypsies and Travellers are targets for prejudice in our country.</p> <p>A frequently asked question is, why can't these people stay where they currently are? The reality for many is that they have no legal right to stay where they are, even if they actually own the land that their caravan is parked on. Families with children can be moved on by authorities, despite the problems it causes for families accessing health and education services.</p> <p>The trouble with many apparently sound policy announcements are unintended consequences they cause. In this case, we risk the further demonisation of an ethnic minority based on centuries of cultural heritage, because their life choices appear at odds with the settled community.</p> <p>The reality is that we do not have enough pitches for the number of Gypsy and Traveller families in this country, and we need to build more. Last January the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) announced funding for 600 new pitches across the country, leaving at least 3,500 families with no legitimate pitch in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Broadland Housing was a successful bidder for part of the HCA pot, and we are currently with our local authority partner to find a site for 12 pitches. The bid was based on the success of a site we built four years ago on the edge of Norwich, where eight families now live and take part in the local community. We have found these tenancies no more difficult to manage than any of the other properties we own nearby. Indeed it has been easier than we expected; the risk averse assumptions we made at the viability stage have proved wildly inappropriate and simply demonstrated the latent prejudices we had as a team at the start of this process.</p> <p>Politicians need to be brave about meeting the needs of Travellers. We need legitimate sites, and powers to move families on should come only once we can be sure we have enough pitches for Gypsy and Traveller families, not before.</p> <p><em>Michael Newey is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/jun/08/broadland-housing-group\" title=\"\"><em>Broadland Housing Group</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more debate, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>There was dismay this week in the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/8-out-of-10-cats\" title=\"\">8 Out of 10 Cats</a> writing room. Usually, when a bunch of TV writers express genuine, heartfelt horror it's because a runner has presented them with a plate of the wrong flavour muffins. But this time it was about something serious, or almost as serious: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/08/april-jones-matthew-woods-jailed?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">the jailing of Matthew Woods</a>. Nineteen years old, and doing three months for making \"grossly offensive\" comments about an abducted child. On his own Facebook page.</p> <p>As you might imagine, seeing someone getting a custodial sentence for making jokes, however disgusting and unimaginative they are, didn't exactly play well among people whose job it is to make jokes. As my fellow writer on <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/10-oclock-live\" title=\"\">10 O'Clock Live</a>, Alan Connor, put it: \"If we've really criminalised attempts to gross out your peers with horrible jokes, then every comedy writer in the UK is, for better or worse, going to be in prison before they take their second sip of coffee tomorrow morning.\"</p> <p>Everyone I spoke to about Matthew Woods and his beery late-night Facebook posts asked versions of the same question: since when did making sick jokes become a crime? \"It seems uncomfortably like an obscenity conviction,\" said the comic <a href=\"http://www.frankieboyle.com/\" title=\"\">Frankie Boyle</a>. \"Millions of horrendous things are said on Twitter every day, how do you police it? Perhaps a better idea would be to police things like direct threats of violence.\"</p> <p>In this case, the only actual threats of violence were directed at Woods. As Charlie Brooker said, \"Presumably Matthew Woods learned a powerful lesson about the potential consequences of tasteless humour when a 50-strong mob turned up at his house and the police had to arrest him for his own safety. Jailing him on top of that is insane. Sick jokes can upset and offend. Hurriedly formed vigilante mobs can kill. If the state earnestly believes that the former pose a greater threat to social order than the latter, the state is nuts.\"</p> <p>The scariest thing about this nutty judgment is its mob logic. The court deemed Woods's jokes a crime under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127\" title=\"\">section 127 of the Communications Act 2003</a>, which outlaws \"grossly offensive\" messages. The chairman of the bench at Chorley magistrates court, Bill Hudson, explained why this resulted in a custodial sentence: \"The reason for the sentence is the seriousness of the offence, the public outrage that has been caused.\"</p> <p>In other words, the \"public outrage\" is evidence of the gross offensiveness (which constitutes the crime). The offence caused is proof of the offence. So in a weird way, the people who decide what's grossly offensive (and therefore criminal) are outraged folks such as knee-jerk journalists and the baying vigilante mob.</p> <p>What's more, according to the Communications Act 2003, those who are grossly offended by the message \"need not be the recipients\". Just so long as somebody gets to be outraged.</p> <p>It's a rationale praised by comedy writers the <a href=\"http://www.dawsonbros.com/\" title=\"\">Dawson Bros</a>: \"If a joke has offended even one solitary person,\" they say, \"the perpetrator should be jailed without trial. A sketch about a dead parrot will not be funny to someone mourning the passing of a beloved bird. Jail <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuW6tQ0218\" title=\"\">the Monty Python six</a>. A skit about gardening implements will sicken anyone whose relative was impaled on a fork handle. Jail <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Ronnies\" title=\"\">Corbett and send Barker's</a> gravestone to landfill. And a man falling through an open bar hatch will deeply offend the countless people who've lost loved ones to lethal pub mishaps. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IBgk05iL3Y\" title=\"\">Jail David Jason</a>. And while you're there, lock up Trigger as an accomplice.\"</p> <p>Personally, I find the public declarations of Chairman Hudson, which have been published online, to be \"grossly offensive\" \u2013 does that mean I can press charges under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003? Surely the problem here lies in this dragnet of a term, \"grossly offensive\".</p> <p>This is the sort of dangerously vague legislation that the comedian Liam Mullone describes as \"fluffy-headed fascism\", which, he says, is, \"largely the legacy of Blair's tenure. In a few short years our government doubled the statute books with a slew of ill thought-out, open-ended, catch-all laws which had relatively little to do with protecting the people and more to do with Blair's penchant for social engineering. They seemed to disregard everything we've learned about the sanctity of individual liberty.\"</p> <p>Never mind liberty, where does it leave comedy? Says Mullone: \"It's going to be impossible to do or say anything remotely interesting in a climate where the mob mentality \u2013 'it upsets me so don't say it' \u2013 is backed by policemen in the wings.\"</p> <p>Part of anyone's job who works in comedy is to scratch about on the fringes of bad taste. It's no wonder comedians are getting nervous.</p> <p>No one I spoke to about Matthew Woods was in a mad rush to defend him as a person \u2013 \"he's obviously a massive prick\" as one producer put it \u2013 but everyone thought it bizarre that this massive prick was behind bars as a result of the things he wrote. Things like: \"Who in their right mind would abduct a ginger kid?\" and the frankly baffling: \"Could have just started the greatest Facebook argument ever. April Fools, Who Wants Maddie?\"</p> <p>No one is defending him on the grounds that he's funny. He's not. But he deserves our support just as much as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/27/twitter-joke-trial-high-court\" title=\"\">Paul Chambers</a>, whose notorious airport-bomb quip was met with a great chorus of righteous retweets from furious defenders of free speech. That chorus seems to have gone a bit quiet, now that it comes to rallying behind \"comments of a sexually explicit nature\" regarding a missing five-year-old.</p> <p>The writer and broadcaster Victoria Coren warns: \"It's easy for us peaceable western liberals to make a fuss when a likeable musician or poet is censored in a faraway country. But when it's a revolting moron being offensive in our own country, the point is still the same: you can't start sending people to prison for saying something you don't like.\"</p> <p>Turns out, in Chorley at least, you can.</p>",

Furthermore, the investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to deliver energy to our customers' homes, and the costs of the government's policies for a clean, energy efficient Britain, are all going up.\"</p> <p>Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: \"This is a bitter blow for consumers and comes just ahead of winter when the impact on bills will be even more acute.</p> <p>\"With SSE's price hike coming into effect next Monday and now Britain's biggest supplier announcing a rise of its own, the writing is on the wall for consumers this winter \u2013 energy bills are going skywards.\"</p> <p>It is widely anticipated that the remaining energy suppliers that make up the \"big six\" will soon follow suit with similar price rises.

  "<p>You no longer need an Oxbridge degree, a private education or a Y chromosome to reach the top positions in the civil service.</p> <p>A 2010 <a href=\"http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hro/news/1017327/civil-service-diverse-report\" title=\"\">survey</a> into the socio-economic background of the top 200 civil servants found that nearly three-quarters had attended a state school. The proportion of women in senior civil service positions has more than doubled since 1996, and the percentage of ethnic minority civil servants increased by almost half between 1998 and 2008. Generally speaking, civil service leaders are a far more diverse bunch than you're likely to find in the boardroom of a private sector company.</p> <p>However, one group does appear to be doing better than others when it comes to bagging the top jobs: economists.</p> <p>In 2010, 159 of the 465 people on the civil service's fast stream scheme, which aims to speed candidates into top-level jobs, had degrees in economics. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the current cabinet secretary, has a background in economics, as did his predecessor, Lord O'Donnell, and his predecessor, Lord Turnbull. Not, in itself, conclusive evidence that the economists predominate in leadership roles, but certainly an interesting trend.</p> <p>Heywood says a number of specialisms have actually gained ground alongside economics. \"With the common feature that most of them require some sort of commercial nous and numeracy skills. That's become predominantly more important than simply drafting good policy advice, as it were.\"</p> <p>He feels it's important for senior teams to have a broad mix of skills, with people with experience of project delivery working alongside those with analytical expertise. \"It's one thing designing a policy that looks brilliant to an economist, a lawyer, or a scientist; it's another thing to design something which will actually work in the real world,\" he says. \"It's through that blend of skills that ministers will get proper advice on the right policies, the right way of analysing the situation, and also the right way of putting in place something that will work in practice.\"</p> <p>Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the home civil service and a CIPFA-qualified accountant, is also keen for people to accrue a broad range of skills before they progress into senior management positions. \"Have they got experience doing operational work? Have they got experience of working outside the public sector in the private sector? When have they commissioned and run big projects, or done big contracts? Those are things you're looking for. It's their work experience rather than their professional background [that's important].\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, Jonathan Rees, director general of the <a href=\"http://homeoffice.gov.uk/equalities/\" title=\"\">Government Equalities Office</a>, who has been a civil servant for 35 years, says there are now \"clearly more economists\" heading large organisations than there were in the past. From 2000-2004, Rees was head of consumer and competition policy at the Department for Trade and Industry, and one of his jobs was to set out the new governance of the Office of Fair Trading. \"If I go back to when I sponsored the OFT, it wasn't unusual for there to be generalists \u2013 in our language 'policy people'. Now, most of the staff are either economists or lawyers.\" he says.</p> <p>Rees is keen to have economists who have also done policy roles as part of his team, as \"having an understanding of the economic case for equality is quite important\". But he also reiterates Heywood's point about the importance of diversity: \"If you have a senior team that is all economists, it is just as likely to make a mistake as a senior team that is all lawyers, or a senior team that is all policy generalists.\"</p> <h2>The local government view</h2> <p>After a wave of accountancy and legal professionals taking the top roles in local government, Trish Haines, chief executive of Worcestershire county council, moved into senior management just as there was an increasing emphasis on partnerships. This led to more people from educational or social care backgrounds coming forward, says Haines, who began her own career as social worker.</p> <p>Will the current focus on budget cuts lead to more economists taking up these positions? \"You're always looking for somebody to bring the skills that meet the needs that the council are saying are very important ones in their area,\" says Haines. \"Without a doubt, prosperity and economic growth are going to be higher priorities now, but I don't think the answer to that will automatically be that if you've got an economics degree you're the right person.\"</p> <p>Indeed, at Suffolk county council, which is responsible for \u00a31bn of public money every year, people with a range of skills are needed, says the chief executive, Deborah Cadman. \"That said,\" she adds, \"we've placed economic growth at the heart of our corporate strategy, which means people with economics backgrounds and experience are key to our success.\"</p> <h2>Private sector knowledge</h2> <p>As the private sector has become more intertwined with the public sector, it has become more important for public sector leaders to have a broad understanding of private sector economics. \"If you don't understand the profit motive in the private sector \u2013 how to commission, how to procure effectively, cost benefits \u2013 you're probably going to fall short,\" says Simon Virley, director general for energy markets and infrastructure group in the Department of Energy and Climate Change.</p> <p>Obviously some leadership roles \u2013 those in the Treasury, for example \u2013 demand greater economic literacy than others. But as Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, says: \"Given that we are working in a globalised economy ... there are, in my view, increasingly few areas of government policy where economics is not a relevant input to policy making.\"</p> <p>If you're aiming for a top job, that's surely a point worth bearing in mind.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>Of all the mysteries and controversies around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,5860,659004,00.html\" title=\"\">the Falklands war</a>, that patchily reported, pivotal confrontation 30 years ago, some of the deepest involve submarines. Did Britain seriously consider threatening Argentina with submarine-launched nuclear missiles, as has sometimes been alleged, if less apocalyptic tactics failed? Was Argentina dissuaded from launching an earlier invasion of the islands, in 1977, by Margaret Thatcher's less bellicose but militarily shrewder predecessor, Jim Callaghan, who despatched a submarine to the south Atlantic as a deterrent? And most infamously, why exactly was the elderly Argentinian cruiser Belgrano sunk by a British submarine in May 1982, killing 323 sailors and hugely escalating the Falklands conflict?</p> <p>This book touches tantalisingly on the first two questions but only seriously addresses the third. Prebble's subject, the attack submarine HMS Conqueror, whose history and on-board culture he describes with compelling intimacy but sometimes questionable reverence, torpedoed the Belgrano. He is also good on the broader, murky business of undersea warfare. In the early 80s, submarines could still easily hide, but also slid through the oceans semi-blind. Their tightly bonded crews habitually kept quiet about their missions whenever they resurfaced. \"Submariners have an air about them,\" he writes, \"which seems to hint that they know things the rest of us can never know.\"</p> <p>The Conqueror was a fat, finned sea monster of a vessel, nuclear-powered but not nuclear-armed, used by the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1990. The stories Prebble has prised from its crewmen, some named and some not, go beyond the Belgrano incident and its highly charged aftermath, and into waters previously uncharted by journalists and historians. From this testimony, and other, guardedly described research - there are no footnotes or lists of primary sources, only a brief bibliography made up mostly of standard histories - he has extracted quite a scoop: that both shortly before and shortly after the Falklands war, the Conqueror undertook a bizarre but ultimately successful cold-war mission which has remained secret ever since.</p> <p>In August 1982, \"close to, or inside, the territorial waters of the USSR\", probably near the Soviet naval base of Murmansk, the submarine stole a giant eastern bloc undersea listening device. A long, thick metal cable strung with unusually effective underwater microphones and designed to be towed by a submarine or surface vessel, the stolen device was an important component in both the maritime balance of power and east-west espionage. Britain and America, writes Prebble, needed to know whether the cable had been developed by the Russians or copied from similar western technology by Soviet agents. With typical, baffling-to-civilians services humour, the Royal Navy called the undersea heist Operation Barmaid.</p> <p>Prebble is a veteran TV producer, and in the introduction he talks up his exclusive in the style of a press release or the breathless opening minutes of a modern documentary, as \"a tale as incredible as the exploits of James Bond, straight out of John le Carr\u00e9\". Some of the story of how Prebble got it is threaded through the book, mildly self-congratulatory journalistic reminiscences running alongside the sterner military history.</p> <p>As a young producer in the mid-80s, he had made a Belgrano film based around an interview with an unusually forthcoming former junior officer from the Conqueror, Narendra Sethia, who had kept a diary that dealt in detail with the Argentinian ship's sinking. Sethia and his diary had been drawn into the vortex of smears, cover-ups and revelations that followed the torpedoing, but he had been happy with Prebble's programme, and afterwards invited him to his wedding in south London. \"Later that day I found myself in a nearby public house with several of the former crew of the Conqueror,\" writes Prebble. The conversation turned to an infamous missing six months in the official log of the submarine's activities, including the Belgrano incident, which Sethia \u2013 wrongly \u2013 had been accused of stealing. With a little prompting from the ex-submariners, Prebble suddenly came to a realisation. Much more of the log had disappeared than the few days dealing with the Belgrano: \"Perhaps what was being hidden was not to do with the [Falklands] war.\" He cagily continues: \"One way and another, in the course of the remainder of that evening and after some other enquiries in the following days, I learned about \u2026 Operation Barmaid.\"</p> <p>With the cold war still going on, he quickly \u2013 too quickly? \u2013 decided that Barmaid was too sensitive to \"national security\" to reveal to the public. He would wait until a less delicate moment. For quite a few chapters, the reader waits for the story of Barmaid too. Nonfiction books that are labours of love can have their disadvantages, such as the desire to include every scrap of material, and instead there are long, extraneous passages about the off-duty exploits of the Conqueror's sailors, and about Sethia in particular, his family background and his post-navy life running a yachting business in the Carribbean. In the hands of a more novelistic writer, this could add up to more than padding and colour: there is clearly a connection between the elaborate pranks played on each other by the submariners and the slyness and cheek of the Barmaid plan, but Prebble is too fond of blokey anecdotes about naughty sailors in \"some of the most exotic locations in the world\" to properly draw it out.</p> <p>Excited stuff about the Conqueror as \"a state-of-the-art fighting machine\" and submarines as \"the chariots of modern war\" also mars the early pages. But once the submarine puts to sea for its cold war and Falklands missions, the tone shifts. Prebble writes concretely and well about the vessel and life on board it: the impossibly tight spaces, the incessant hums and smells, the lack of exercise, the absence of nature except for the potentially crushing mass of water all around.</p> <p>The attack on the Belgrano is described clearly, blow by blow. \"Late that morning \u2026 the captain announced to the crew that they had orders to sink the Belgrano and that after lunch they would be going to action stations.\" Before condemning the Argentinians to burn, freeze or drown, the submariners ate \"roast pork with all the trimmings\". After the sinking, some of the submariners were \"all pumped up\"; others were stunned and introspective.</p> <p>The account holds no bigger revelations. These come instead, at last, in two dozen concluding pages on Operation Barmaid. Back at base in Scotland after the Falklands, the Conqueror was secretly fitted with two pairs of giant pincers. Then it slipped out to sea to intercept an eastern bloc trawler that had been spotted towing one of the sought-after listening cables. With canny, patient navigation, the submarine rose slowly upwards beneath the trawler, to within \"a few feet\" of its engine propellers, without being detected. Then one pair of pincers cut through the cable, roughly, to make the break look like an accident. The other pair grabbed the severed section before it sank to the sea floor. And the Conqueror ghosted away with its precious cargo.</p> <p>Once the submarine docked in Scotland again, \"within hours\" the cable \"was on its way to Prestwick airport for a flight across the Atlantic for analysis\". What our American allies learned from the seized listening device, and whether the Russians saw its disappearance as suspicious, Prebble, despite his own impressive display of patience and ingenuity here, does not know. Some of the secrets of the Conqueror, like many of those of the cold war, elude us still.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett's <em>When the Lights Went Out</em> is published by Faber.</p>",
  "<p>Seven Royal Marines have been arrested on suspicion of murder after one of their colleagues came forward and claimed an insurgent had been killed in a manner that broke the military's strict rules of engagement.</p> <p>The incident happened in Afghanistan's Helmand province last year, but it is thought investigators only began an inquiry in recent weeks when the \"code of silence\" among the marines was broken by one of those who is said to have witnessed the alleged crime.</p> <p>The seven marines were arrested on Thursday by the Royal Military police and the inquiry will now be undertaken by the Ministry of Defence's service justice system, which was specifically set up to allow the investigation in the UK of personnel who may have committed an offence overseas.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence said on Thursday night that it could not give details about the ongoing inquiry. But the disclosure is a blow to the Royal Marines, who are regarded as being among the elite of the armed forces, and are the pride of the Royal Navy.</p> <p>It is a gift to the Taliban, which will undoubtedly seize on the allegation as evidence that Nato's forces in Afghanistan cannot be trusted.</p> <p>The Royal Marines were in Helmand last year between April and September as part of 3 Commando Brigade, which was led by Brigadier Ed Davis. They were operating in the districts of Nahr-e Saraj and Nad Ali, where scores of British troops have died since 2006.</p> <p>The MoD would not say when the alleged incident took place or where, but confirmed that it was alleged to have happened during a skirmish with insurgents.</p> <p>Nothing untoward was reported to commanding officers at the time, but the investigation began about a month ago when an individual within the military came forward.</p> <p>The MoD stressed that the alleged killing involved a combatant, not a civilian. This suggests the accused men are being investigated for behaviour after the insurgent was already in their custody.</p> <p>An MoD spokesman said: \"The Royal Military police have today arrested seven Royal Marines on suspicion of murder. The arrests relate to an incident in Afghanistan in 2011. The incident followed an engagement with an insurgent: there were no civilians involved.</p> <p>\"The investigation will now be taken forward and dealt with by the service justice system. These arrests demonstrate the department and the armed forces' determination to ensure UK personnel act in accordance with their rules of engagement and our standards. It would be inappropriate to make any further comment while the investigation is under way.\"</p> <p>The MoD said \"as with any serious incident of this nature, there will be an internal review to identify lessons learned. The nature of that review will reflect the developments in and, in due course, the outcome of the investigation\".</p> <p>The Royal Marines won high praise for their conduct during Operation Herrick 14 \u2013 the name given to the deployment. When the marines returned in the autumn last year, the MoD said they had helped to \"strangle the insurgency in Helmand\".</p> <p>It was said their time in Afghanistan had been \"historically significant\".</p> <p>Brigadier Davis said the 6,500 strong brigade had mostly kept the insurgency in check, and that in the first four months of the tour alone, 16 low-level commanders had been killed or captured.</p> <p>However, he warned that there was \"a hard core of the insurgency left. It is becoming harder to kill or capture the ones who are left, so the challenge is still very much still there.\"</p> <p>Nineteen British service personnel died during the tour.</p>",
  "<p>Reading the shocking <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/deadly-fungus-ash-tree-imports\" title=\"\">news about ash die-back</a>, the disease that has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">now affected most of Denmark's ash trees</a> and many of those across the rest of northern Europe, I was reminded that when we lose our wildlife we lose some of our stories.</p> <p>The death of a species, especially a species as significant as the ash, punches a hole not only in nature, but also in our culture.</p> <p>Throughout northern Europe, the ash tree was associated in pagan thought with the guardianship of life. As <a href=\"http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/mythfolk/ash.html\" title=\"\">Paul Kendall explains on the Trees for Life site</a>, in the mythology of the Vikings (and several other northern peoples), an ash known as yggdrasil or the \"world tree\" was the scaffolding on which the universe was built. It</p> <blockquote> <p>\"grew on an island surrounded by the ocean, in the depths of which the World Serpent lay. This ash tree's trunk reached up to the heavens, and its boughs spread out over all the countries of the Earth. Its roots reached down into the Underworld. A squirrel ran up and down the tree carrying messages from the serpent gnawing at the roots to the eagle in the canopy, and back. A deer fed on the ash leaves and from its antlers flowed the great rivers of the world. A magical goat grazed by the tree, and its udders dispensed not milk but mead for the warriors in Odin's Great Hall. The gods held their councils under the canopy of their guardian tree.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Odin, the king of the gods, hanged himself from the tree to obtain cosmic wisdom. During his vigil, one of his eyes was pecked out by ravens. You can see in this myth, as JG Frazer pointed out in the Golden Bough, an obvious correlate of the crucifixion story.</p> <p>Richard Wagner developed the saga in The Ring of the Nibelung. Wotan (Odin), the one-eyed king of the gods, tore the shaft of his spear from the World Ash Tree (spear shafts were typically made from ash poles). On the shaft were inscribed the holy laws and treaties by which the world and the heavens were governed.</p> <p>The mortal hero Siegfried fights Wotan (his grandfather) and hews the shaft of the sacred spear in two, literally breaking the law of the gods. Wotan then suicidally instructs his warriors to hack down the World Ash Tree and pile its branches around Walhall (Valhalla). At the end of the final opera, Wotan's valkyrie daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde casts a brand onto this pyre, and Valhalla is consumed by flame. The source of life becomes the means of destruction.</p> <p>Children love this story (I find it helps if you skim over the incest and the suttee). But if ash die-back follows the same course as Dutch elm disease, I can imagine telling it one day and being asked what an ash tree is. I see this is as a loss that goes beyond the great sadness of picturing the end of the magnificent, well-used trees I know (some of which have been pollarded or coppiced for hundreds of years), which are laden with both wildlife and human history.</p> <p>If the fungus reaches them, they will, as if on Wotan's instructions, be brought down and hacked to pieces. It feels like a kind of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, a twilight of the gods. There is something of the norse deity about an ancient ash tree, grey and clawing and bearded with lichen.</p> <p>Already, though not as a result of the disease, the cultural significance of the tree has begun to slip from our minds. For example, anyone who has split an ash trunk cannot help but be aware of what ash blonde means. The fresh wood is almost white (it darkens, when it had been seasoned and polished, to a beautiful bright gold). Walking through a chemist's shop a few months ago, my eye was caught by a packet of hair dye labelled \"ash blonde\". The model's hair was a charcoal-grey colour. Ash, it seemed, had been interpreted as fire-ash. It felt like a small but sad impoverishment of the language.</p> <p>Other European nations are now begging Britain to ban imports of ash saplings, so that the tree retains an uninfected stronghold. As ever, when faced with a call to impose even the slightest restrictions on business (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/18/bees-pesticides-neonicitinoids\" title=\"\">think of its failure to ban the class of pesticides that are killing bees</a>), the government has dithered and made excuses, and the fungus is now spreading across the country.</p> <p>One of the effects of ash die-back is what foresters call heart rot: the fungus penetrates into the core of the wood. To me this term is freighted with another meaning.</p> <p><a href=\"http://monbiot.com\" title=\"\">monbiot.com</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 November. The main text said that 90% of trees in Denmark had been killed. This is incorrect and has been changed to \"affected\". </p>",
  "<p>As more people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/feb/03/urbanisation-health-systems?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">leave the countryside for the city in the developing world</a>, many continue to rely on agriculture for a living. At least 800 million people in cities in poor countries practise urban agriculture, from growing vegetables to keeping animals \u2013 from chickens to camels \u2013 often in close confinement in densely populated areas.</p> <p>The close proximity of animals and humans can pose health risks. Zoonoses \u2013 diseases transmitted between animals and humans \u2013 are a health problem that particularly affects the poor in developing countries. <a href=\"http://mahider.ilri.org/browse?type=ilrisubject&amp;value=EMERGING+DISEASES&amp;sort_by=2&amp;order=DESC&amp;rpp=20&amp;etal=0\" title=\"\">New research from the International Livestock Research Institute (Ilri)</a> found that zoonoses and diseases recently emerged from animals (swine flu, bird flu, Sars) make up a quarter of infectious diseases in developing countries, compared with just 0.7% in rich countries.</p> <p>Researchers, however, warn that a draconian approach to urban livestock and informal markets \u2013 where traders are unlicensed and pay no tax, and which lack health and safety rules \u2013 can end up doing more harm than good. Outright bans on livestock in urban areas or informal markets is not the answer, they say.</p> <p>\"Getting rid of informal markets is impossible,\" says Delia Grace, a food safety specialist with Ilri, who is based in Nairobi but was in London last week. \"It forces trading to go underground. In Kampala [Uganda], we found traders who were harassed adopted less good practices, which is no surprise as they have to pay more attention to evading authorities than to hygiene.\"</p> <p>Grace rejects the conventional wisdom that supermarkets are necessarily safer than informal markets. Food in traditional markets tends to be cheaper and fresher \u2013 the food moves quickly. By contrast, food in supermarkets can sit around in cabinets for four or five days and can be subject to power cuts.</p> <p>Ilri experts said studies in east Africa, north-east India and Vietnam came to the surprising conclusion that food sold in formal markets (supermarkets), though commonly perceived to be safer, may have lower compliance with standards than informally marketed food.</p> <p>\"This emphasises that food safety policy should be based on evidence and not perception, and failure to do this may be prejudicial to the poor, who dominate and rely on informal value chains,\" Grace says.</p> <p>She argues that education and training rather than heavy-handed tactics are more effective ways to improve safety in the food chain (from farm to fork). Attempts to improve food and safety through ordering farmers to act is likely to be ineffective, as opposed to bringing onside poor dairy farmers and encouraging them to be \"risk managers\", as was the case in Kampala.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, where poor people often keep chickens under the bed in cramped conditions, one appropriate response would be to suggest they be kept in a wicker cage at a distance from the bed, or in a shed close to home. Other simple approaches that have led to improvements in food safety in Kenya and India (milk), and Nigeria (meat) include the use of wide-necked vessels for milk that are easy to clean, tests for food safety that can be applied by consumers and traders (lactometers to check for added water), and peer pressure (the desire to be seen as a good parent).</p> <p>Ilri experts found that gender was a determining factor in food hygiene. Simply put, women were cleaner than men. A study from Ibadan, the capital of Oyo state in southern Nigeria, found that butchers' associations with more women had better food safety practices and better quality of meat, and there was less gastrointestinal illness among people who ate it.</p> <p>A study in Dagoretti, a district in Nairobi, found women had more exposure to cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease transmitted from cattle to humans through their involvement in milking activities, feeding and watering cattle, and caring for sick household members. But it also identified farm workers \u2013 mostly men \u2013 as a group with higher exposure risk.</p> <p>The message from Ilri is that policymakers should avoid kneejerk responses to health scares \u2013 blocking smallholder access to markets and favouring industrialisation. \"These changes are often based on fear, not facts,\" say Ilri experts. \"Without evidence of risk to human health by informally marketed foods or the best way to manage risks while retaining benefits, the food eaten in poor countries is neither safe nor fair.\"</p>",
  "<p>Education is a privilege that we take for granted here in the UK. We take for granted that it is compulsory and we take for granted that up until the age of 18 it is free. We take for granted the fact that we do not have to fight for our education, we do not have to struggle for it and most importantly we do not have to risk our lives for it. But there are many for whom such struggles are a constant reality. Many like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/11/malala-yousufzai-specialist-hospital\">Malala Yousafzai,</a> who have that privilege stolen from them and for whom education is deemed unnecessary. </p> <p>The issue regarding women being educated is one that has been prevalent throughout the ages, stemming largely from the belief that by educating a woman you are doing more harm then good, a view that still exists in fragments today within our own society. Many women will tell you that men feel intimidated by their knowledge or expertise in a certain field, indicating that the archaic view of the man being the dominant leader and omniscient, is still apparent within us.</p> <p>I recall my grandmother narrating to us, that her eldest brother pulled her out of school when she hit puberty; she stated that he was concerned that if she continued to be educated she would not marry the man who was betrothed to her. My grandfather is significantly older then my grandmother and was a divorcee. When asked how she felt about her brothers decision, my grandmother replied she was furious but later saw the wisdom of his decision; she would definitely have not married my grandfather if she had continued her education.</p> <p>As a young third generation British Asian girl growing up in Bradford, I encountered this backward mentality directed to my parents from some within my own community. Many stated that I did not need to be educated. Instead I should be educated to the bare minimum and be married off at an early age in order to remove myself as a burden from my parents. Others argued that if I was educated \"too much\" I would become difficult to control and education would grant me \"too much\" freedom, it would be hard then for me to conform to the expectations many had set for me. Fortunately I can tell you they were right. My education educated and liberated me, it allowed me to critically analyse the problems that i saw around me and to openly question and challenge them. My questions brought discomfort and I was regularly cautioned by elder members of my community for asking \"too many questions.\" Unfortunately, I know of many girls here in the UK, who are pulled out of school because education is seen as a threat to what their elders expect of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397617590\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/9/1349817419536/Pakistan-doctors-assist-M-002.jpg\" alt=\"Pakistan doctors assist Malala Yousafzai\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pakistan military doctors assist Malala Yousafzai. Photograph: Ispr Handout/EPA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ispr Handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So in a sense I can understand why the Taliban banned the education of girls when they took over the Swat Valley. They, like my great uncle and many others in Pakistan, felt threatened by the effect of educating a girl. You see Malcolm X pretty much has summed it up for us. When you educate a woman, you don't just educate her, you liberate her. You allow her to travel on a path of self-discovery and you enable her to question her position in society. You empower her by giving her knowledge of what she can become. And this is dangerous. It is dangerous to the Taliban because it means that they will not be able to impose their patriarchal laws upon liberated women, it means that if they do they will be presented with a challenge and a force greater then them. And their rule will be effectively be diminished. It was a threat and a risk they couldn't take. </p> <p>So for those asking what Malala Yousafzai has done to the Taliban, this is exactly what she has done. At the tender age of 11, Malala started writing in order to articulate her hopes and fears under a false name. When her cover was blown and she was threatened by the Taliban and its sympathizers, she did not cease her writing. In contrast she went public, so that by the age of 14 she was a name and a force to be reckoned with. You see by educating Malala, her parents had given her her greatest gift. They had enabled her to understand her potential and to recognise that her writing was a tool, it was the sword of opposition to the men who had taken away her privilege of studying. It was her opportunity to stick her middle finger up in defiance and to seek vengeance and boy, did she strike fear in their hearts! Malala Yousafzai was a threat because her defiance was an inspiration to others, others who lacked her bravery and her strength of character and determination. It was an act of defiance that could ignite a movement of opposition, an opposition the Taliban desperately wanted to quash, threaten and intimidate.</p> <p>Their motive behind shooting Malala is a simple one: shoot the leader and you scare the followers. To them it is a message of force, but in reality it is an act of cowardice. It is an act which demonstrates how pig-headed the Taliban really are. It demonstrates their weakness and fragility. So weak that a young girl armed with her writing can be seen as a great threat, a threat so damaging to them that even after shooting her they state that if she does not die they will strike once more. It is this latter thought that makes them real fools. By believing that they have eliminated a threat by shooting Malala, or even, God forbid ,by killing her, they are seriously deluded. This act will inspire many more like Malala, frustrated with the oppression of women that they encounter daily, frustrated with their lack of human rights and frustrated by their governments inability to protect them. </p> <p>They will rise out of their slumber with a sense of empowerment and purpose to set a precedent for future generations, and I pray to God that when they do, Malala is there to lead them once again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397617591\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349987080776/me.jpg\" alt=\"malala\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Sabbiyah Pervez </strong>is a politics and philosophy graduate and operations manager at the award-winning counter-extremist and gender <a href=\"http://www.wewillinspire.com/index.php/sections/who-we-are\">empowerment consultancy Inspire</a>.

Apart from that though.. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2151\">Counterfeit power supply units in the UK &gt;&gt; Raspberry Pi</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>We've found that there are three specific, different kinds of fake Apple charger popping up and causing trouble in the UK. We know that Trading Standards are already aware of these fake PSUs; apparently raids on suppliers have been carried out, but there are still plenty of them out there. Here's some video which should help you check that yours is the real thing. If you find that your charger is a fake, take it back to the seller and raise a stink: and most importantly, stop using it immediately. You could damage your Pi or yourself (and anything else you plug into the PSU).</p> </blockquote> <p> (Thanks @rubbernuke for the link.)</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/htc-tablets-fade-us-market-firm-keeps-options-open/2012-10-09\">HTC tablets fade from US market, but firm keeps options open &gt;&gt; FierceWireless</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>However, [HTC global communications manager Jeff Gordon] acknowledged that Apple's iPad continues to dominate the tablet market and he said that HTC would only consider returning to the tablet space if it developed a product that could make inroads against the iPad and other tablets.</p> <p> Gordon said it's unclear what strategy HTC might take in a possible return to tablets. He said the company could try to tackle the lower-end of the market, as Google has attempted with the Wi-Fi-only Nexus 7, or it could build a more powerful device that would cost more.</p> <p> \"We're very much not set on one strategy over another,\" he said. HTC's previous tablet entries have spanned the gamut: The company's Jetstream launched at $700 and its W-Fi-only Flyer device sold for $299 through Best Buy.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

  "<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/181/\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/181/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>She was calm, articulate and relentless \u2013 and unlike the two candidates, moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the undoubted star of this year's vice-presidential debate. </p> <p>Raddatz never lost control, not of time nor of substance, unlike her predecessor, Jim Lehrer, in last week's presidential campaign debate. She hit all the tough questions expected of a candidate for US vice-president, with a detailed, precise knowledge. She was low-key but gracefully on point enough to steal the show.<br> To Congressman Ryan she said gently on Libya: \"I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney, and you're talking about this again tonight, talked about the weakness, talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?\" The rebuke was implied, but all the more effective for being so. It put Ryan on the defensive and Raddatz shone as the woman who had shown him up. She didn't go much easier on Biden either. Biden was like the boy debater who'd had a Red Bull with a Gatorade chaser backstage. He wanted to argue with anyone in sight at the top of his voice till the clock ran out. But Raddatz quietly reined him in. (crosstalk) Biden: \"With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\"<br>Raddatz: (without a beat) \"And why is that so?\"<br>Biden: \"Because not a single thing he said is accurate.\"<br>Raddatz: \"Be specific.\"<br> <br>She controlled the candidates to the extent that she got them to face (albeit unwillingly at times) the tough topics she had come up with.<br> <br>\"Should the US have apologised for Americans burning Qur'ans in Afghanistan?\" she asked Ryan. \"Should the US apologise for US Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?\"</p> <p>The directness of her approach sped up the debate process even as it occasionally left the candidates struggling for words. But when that happened, she was a helpful prompter.</p> <p>Ryan: \"Oh gosh, yes, Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we should not apologise for \u2026<br>Raddatz: \"Burning Qur'ans immediately?\"<br>Ryan: \"What \u2013 what we should not be apologising for is standing up for our values ...\"<br> <br>Domestically Raddatz took them to task on health, then senior care. And then she came at them with this:<br> <br>Raddatz: \"If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes. Who will pay less?\"<br>As Ryan waffled on detail, she interrupted him.<br>Raddatz: \"Do you have the specifics? Do you have the ...\"<br>Biden (interrupting): \"That would be a first for the Republican Congress.\"<br>Raddatz: \"Do you know exactly what you're doing?\"<br> <br>Specifics, precision, exact answers. This is not a concept that American debates with their waffly pre-planned written essays for answers are used to. By the time Raddatz got to talk to what half the voting population saw as the highlight of the debate, there was real excitement around America's television sets and computer screens, despite a lengthy detour on defence spending and the US presence in Afghanistan.<br> <br>Raddatz: \"We have two Catholic candidates first time on a stage such as this. And I would like you both to tell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion \u2026 please talk personally about this if you could.\"<br> <br>(I'll distill the answers here in the interest of space)<br> <br>Ryan: \"Why am I pro-life? It's not simply because of my Catholic faith \u2026 It's also because of reason and science \u2026 The policy of the Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother \u2026\"</p> <p>Biden: \"My religion defines who I am \u2026 But I refuse to impose it in equally devout Christians, Muslims and Jews. I do not believe we have a right to tell \u2026 women they can't control their body.\"<br> <br>The thoughtfulness of her questions forced the candidates to reveal more of themselves than perhaps they wanted to. For example, the low-key question at the end: \"If you are elected what can you give to this country as a man as a human being that no one could?\" could have been answered any one of a hundred ways.<br> <br>Which meant that many of the answers could be filled with potholes. How do you define yourself? Do you even try? If you don't, are you missing an opportunity? <br> <br>It did look like something of a copout when instead of responding to Raddatz's opportunity to reintroduce himself, Ryan ducked and returned to spouting economic solutions. The better turn was performed by Biden: \"Look at my record,\" he began before defining himself as someone whose whole life had been about working for improvements for the middle class.<br> <br>At the end of the debate, liberals praised Raddatz for doing a thorough professional job. Conservatives continued to lambast her bias for the fact that Obama had attended her wedding while at Harvard Law School 21 years ago. (She is since divorced.)</p> <p>But of the three personalities on stage there was one clear winner, and it was not a man, nor a candidate. Congratulations, Martha Raddatz.</p>"
