  "<p>Craig Kieswetter, as one of the few England internationals in the England Lions side, had less to prove than some in the unofficial Test match against Australia A.</p> <p>But he proved it all the same, with an unbeaten 112 from only 128 balls, including 17 fours and a six, to leave Australia's bowlers, including the Test men Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon, looking bedraggled at the end of day three.</p> <p>The Lions were in trouble at 53 for four and then 99 for five before Kieswetter and Chris Woakes pulled them round.</p> <p>Varun Chopra top-edged a hook, Joe Root was strangled down the leg-side and Eoin Morgan was bowled as he played forward diffidently.</p> <p>Ben Stokes made half-promises to be the partner Kieswetter was looking for, striking some lusty blows in a skittish innings of 26 before, pulling, he edged to the keeper.</p> <p>But then Kieswetter and Woakes turned the day on its head, adding 100 in exactly 100 balls and by the close they had put on 141 in only 23 overs.</p> <p>Woakes was no slouch, making 48 from 65 balls, with 10 fours. But Kieswetter was the dominant partner and hit his second fifty from 36 deliveries.</p> <p>England's one-day wicketkeeper-batsman was 71 not out at tea and immediately after the interval he hit the New South Wales bowler Jackson Bird for four off the first two deliveries, before clouting the last ball of the over for six over midwicket.</p> <p>But perhaps his best stroke was when he hit Lyon into a puddle beyond the boundary rope. The ball, which had been reversing for the Australian fast bowlers, was changed and then batting became even easier.</p> <p>Kieswetter said: \"The rhythms were good. The Aussies bowled well in the middle session. But after tea they didn't put the ball in the same positions and it was important we took control and batted ourselves out of a losing position.</p> <p>\"We showed some class and character, which is what we're looking for in English cricket. When we got the ball wet and they changed it, it was good for us. They had a good ball and it reversed big and then they lost it. I think we'd feel pissed off in the same position.\"</p> <p>Now the one-day specialist Kieswetter would like to be considered for the longer game. \"I would like to be part of it, he said. \"To play the longest format is still the pinnacle. I've got to score big runs and occupy the crease. Matty Prior has rightly been nominated as Test cricketer of the year. My job is to put pressure on Matt. And if you score runs for the Lions you get rewarded with opportunities.</p> <p>\"But I'd hate to be pigeon-holed as just a keeper-batsman. I'd like to think I have the capability to be picked as a keeper or a batsman. I'd love to be part of it.\"</p>",
  "<p>A heavy stench of death filled the air as a body was pulled from the ruins. Children lifted boulders to reveal bits of flesh and bone. Survivors stood weeping in the wreckage of their houses.</p> <p>At least 40 people are thought to have been killed when government jets bombarded the provincial Syrian town of Azaz on Wednesday. On Thursday, the full scale of the carnage became clear as journalists and human rights monitors reached the scene close to the Turkish border.</p> <p>Local people estimated that around 64 homes had been damaged or destroyed by the airstrike. Standing on a pile of concrete where his home once stood, Ahmad al-Aboud, 57, said he didn't hear a plane approaching. \"There was a big explosion like an earthquake. We're all poor workers' families. We don't even have a gun in this area,\" he said.</p> <p>Another survivor told researchers from Human Rights Watch (HRW) he had seen his house destroyed with most of his extended family inside. He said: \"I buried 12 of my family members today, including my father, my mother, and my sister \u2013 my brother's wife as well. Walid, my brother, was cut to pieces. We didn't recognise him at first. We buried my brother's children also. The youngest was 40 days old.\"</p> <p>Most of the seriously injured have been taken to Turkey through a nearby border crossing that has been commandeered by the Free Syrian Army. The crossing is also increasingly being used as a supply line into northern Syria, where a buffer zone had been established in all but name before Wednesday's regime attack.</p> <p>\"This horrific attack killed and wounded scores of civilians and destroyed a whole residential block,\" said Anna Neistat, HRW's acting emergencies director. \"Yet again, Syrian government forces attacked with callous disregard for civilian life.\" HRW said two nearby rebel facilities \u2013 an FSA brigade headquarters and a prison where government fighters were held \u2013 may have been targets of the jets.</p> <p>As the people of Azaz counted their dead, a diplomatic solution seemed less likely than ever. Officials in New York said the UN security council would end its observer mission in Syria.</p> <p>Before a security council meeting in New York on Friday, France and Russia both said the UN body would not renew the mandate of its much criticised four-month mission, which has been unable to stem the violence in Syria and has led to the resignation of its former chief, Kofi Annan. A veteran Algerian diplomat, Lakhdar Brahimi, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/un-finds-new-syria-mediator\" title=\"\">has confirmed he will replace Annan</a> as the international mediator on Syria, but with an altered mandate, UN sources said on Thursday.</p> <p>Friday's meeting is also due to discuss the Syrian regime's increased use of its air force over the past month, especially in the battle for Aleppo and its surrounds, where rebel forces are unable to combat the use of fast jets repeatedly dropping heavy bombs.</p> <p>People in Azaz are linking the airstrike to the kidnapping of a group of Lebanese Shia pilgrims in the area in May, according to one local person. The Lebanese hostages' whereabouts has been the subject of much interest in their homeland. A splinter group from the Free Syrian Army claims to be holding the men and alleges that some are linked to the Lebanese militia and political bloc, Hezbollah.</p> <p>\"They were abducted by a gang named Ammar Dadikhi who claimed to be part of the FSA,\" said Abu Yousif when contacted by Skype. \"They are not FSA \u2013 they are based at the mountain and they have even kidnapped FSA members and civilians from Azaz. Azaz has nothing to do them, these gangsters are kidnapping people for money.</p> <p>\"I can assure they [the Lebanese] are not in Azaz and they [the kidnappers] do not represent the people of Azaz. All the people of Azaz have denounced the kidnapping of these Lebanese. Our main motive is to get our freedom and change the regime. We do not want to abduct or kill anyone.\"</p> <p>Azaz is part of a swath of north-western Syria that is under effective rebel control after an assault launched by rebel forces in mid-July. Syrian troops have been absent from the area since they were ousted in days of fighting that coincided with the rebel assault on Syria's second city, Aleppo.</p> <p>The regime has massed large numbers of tanks and infantry on Aleppo's southern outskirts, but has so far not sent them into the city, preferring to shell from afar with tanks and artillery and use its fighter jets to bomb key targets.</p> <p>A bakery in Aleppo was hit by a shell early on Thursday, killing an estimated 18 people, witnesses said. Rights groups said more than 150 people had been killed in Syria throughout the day. Daily death tolls, including those of regime troops, have been consistently higher in the past month than at any time since the uprising began in March 2011.</p> <p>Key rebel towns, including al-Bab on the north-eastern edge of Aleppo, were also bombed by jets on Thursday . The bombing seemed aimed at re-establishing regime power over a strategically crucial area, which is now being used as one of three nationwide hubs of the uprising.</p> <p>Syrian forces remain battle deployed in most of the country's key cities. Though weakened by defections and desertions, they still outgun and outman the rebel army, which is plagued by leadership problems but has shown an increasing ability to hold key ground.</p> <p>There were conflicting reports about the welfare of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's brother, Maher al-Assad, who controls a key army division. Two officials told Reuters that Maher had lost a leg in the explosion in Damascus that killed regime security tsar Assef Shawkat. The Guardian could not confirm the report.</p> <p>In Damascus the UN's humanitarian chief, Lady Amos, said: \"All parties must do more to protect civilians.\"</p> <p>France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said in Jordan that Assad was \"butchering his own people and the sooner he goes the better\".</p>",

  "<p>Alan Pardew is delighted to have finally secured the \u00a36.7m signing of Vurnon Anita, 23, from Ajax and believes the deep-lying playmaker's arrival will accelerate the development of Newcastle United's possession-based game. After describing the 5ft 6in, Holland international, who can also operate at both left and right back, as \"a number one character\", Pardew elaborated on Anita's talents. \"When you come through the Ajax system you have to have technical ability, trust me,\" said Newcastle's manager.</p> <p>\"Watching his passing this morning, you could tell he is at the level of our top players. We want to build on what we did last year and control games. If we're going to do that we need the ball and Anita is definitely going to help us on that side. He's also a top character.\"</p> <p>Before agreeing to join Newcastle, Anita asked to meet Pardew to discuss tactics and playing philosophy. \"I wanted to speak to the staff first,\" he said. \"I heard the philosophy of the club and it was great to hear. I'm very, very happy to be here. They showed me a video and it was good to see. The team really wants to play attractive football and that's my style.</p> <p>\"Sunderland also wanted me but I chose Newcastle because they really wanted me and they play wonderful football. I like to be a playmaker. I'm little but I can be very tough on the field and, if the coach needs me to, I can play anywhere.\"</p> <p>Ideally Pardew, who seems to have virtually given up on the idea of bringing Andy Carroll back to Tyneside from Liverpool, would like one more new face, preferably the Lille right-back Matthieu Debuchy, before the transfer window closes.</p> <p>\"Having kept my key players this summer I would not mind the window closing now,\" Pardew said. \"But if we can add another, that would be the icing on the cake.\"</p> <p>Any sales will be resisted. \"We're vulnerable to a Champions League club and the salaries and fees they can pay,\" said Pardew. \"But Mike Ashley [Newcastle's owner] does not sell cheap so they'd have to pay a lot of money.\"</p> <p>Newcastle face a tough start to the season with a home game against Tottenham on Saturday evening, before a trip to Greece for a Europa League first-leg qualifier against Atromitos of Athens on Thursday and then a visit to Chelsea next Saturday.</p> <p>\"I noted how Stoke played a complete second XI in one of their Europa games last season and left senior players behind,\" said Pardew. \"I can understand that. We have to be very intelligent in what we do.</p> <p>\"The scheduling of the Chelsea game is a bit unfortunate as, with the Notting Hill Carnival being on in London that weekend, the police more or less dictated it had to be played on the Saturday which gives us a really tight turnaround. It gives us a disadvantage.\"</p> <p>So much so that Newcastle's manager is pondering flying to Athens without some key performers who would be rested ahead of the Stamford Bridge fixture. \"I might possibly leave some senior players in England,\" he said. \"But we're really pleased to be in the Europa League and, if we can, we'll try and give it a real good go.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Two ways to deal with political turbulence. One is to take immediate action: sack someone; set up an inquiry. The other is to opine, as James Callaghan never quite did: \"Crisis? What crisis?\" Amid mounting concerns about the elections to find the new cadre of elected police commissioners, policing minster Nick Herbert has opted for the latter. \"Forget the carping about police and crime commissioner elections,\" <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2012/08/fromnickherbertmp.html\" title=\"\">writes the man with the plan on the website ConservativeHome</a>. \"It's the summer silly season and the media are landing on anything they can to whip up a story. So \u2013 shock, horror \u2013 candidates will be disqualified if they have convictions for an imprisonable offence. Just imagine the BBC's sanctimonious reaction if they'd discovered someone standing with a conviction.\" Which would be a reasonable line of defence if the only malcontents were to be found within the media. But, in truth, there is disquiet expressed by Labour types, independents and Conservatives, all of it documented in detail, not least by the admirable website <a href=\"http://topofthecops.com/\" title=\"\">topofthecops</a>. Isn't shooting the messenger a firearms offence?</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, crisis, what crisis? We should all jolly well be ashamed of ourselves, implying that all is wrong when all is right. But before donning that hair shirt, let us compare and contrast. On one hand, we have Labour's candidate in Avon and Somerset <a href=\"http://bobashford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bob Ashford</a>. He has had to withdraw because, nearly 50 years ago \u2013 aged 13 \u2013 he trespassed on a railway embankment and was fined \u00a35. Ashford later became head of strategy for the Youth Justice Board and enjoyed Home Office security clearance. No place for Bob. Whereas Kevin Carroll \u2013 he of the English Defence League, who was convicted of a public order offence in 2010 and given a conditional discharge after hurling abuse at Muslims the previous year in Luton, ordered by a judge to pay \u00a3175 costs and then another \u00a3330 costs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-10731035\" title=\"\">when his appeal was thrown out</a> \u2013 can stand with the government's blessing. His was not an imprisonable offence. So as you see, it's all going very well.</p> <p>\u2022 And the jobless figure released this week \u2013 down 46,000 to 2.56 million \u2013 would seem to give further reason for optimism. The total is the lowest this year. \"Benefits Britain is learning how to work again,\" according to the Sun. And there is brand new opportunity courtesy of Tesco. The supermarket behemoth is looking for buyers. Not just anybody. Required, according to the ad, <a href=\"http://www.tesco-careers.com/job.cfm/reference/2317/source/BOND/\" title=\"\">are people who \"achieve their targets\" by \"getting someone else to pay\"</a>, \"buying for less\" and \"re-engineering\", which many translate as screwing farmers. Perhaps they're getting in quick before the introduction of the new code of practice which will ensure that they do the right thing by suppliers. It won't be a perfect arrangement, but then, every little helps.</p> <p>\u2022 We instinctively feel it's going well; and here we are guided by Nadia Cenci, a Tory councillor in Ipswich, and also a \"qualified confidence and performance coach and licensed neuro linguistic programming practitioner\". She has an approach commendable to any politician. \"Why I don't listen to experts (or facts and figures),\" was the subject of <a href=\"http://ipswichpolitics.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/why-i-dont-listen-to-experts-or-facts.html\" title=\"\">Nadia's blog posting last week</a>. \"I have not needed anyone to tell me that global warming is a sham. I knew that years ago. The same as my gut instinct told me that the so-called ice age in the 70s was a load of old rubbish.\" Nadia foresaw the financial crash before Vince Cable, \"I just sensed it\". She also dreamed her roof would blow off in a hurricane the night before it did. \"My then boyfriend called me a witch,\" writes Nadia. Ipswich turned municipally to Labour at the last election. Can't think why.</p> <p>\u2022 And to end, a prayer. This from our scary friends in the fundamentalist group <a href=\"http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/?p=3832\" title=\"\">Christian Voice UK</a>. \"Thank God for the Russians and the Chinese,\" they say. Let us pray \"that&#xa0;Britain will pull back from its unqualified support of the Syrian rebels and realise that the Assad regime, with all its faults, remains the last protector of the Christian and Alawite minorities in Syria. Pray for more even reporting of&#xa0;the conflict. Pray that the Russians and Chinese will stand firm against western and Saudi duplicity.\" One man's&#xa0;hero really is another's villain.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>As defined by the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html\" title=\"\">United Nations convention on refugees</a>, a refugee is a person who \"owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country\". A little later on, the text of the convention specifically states that refugee status \"shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that \u2026 he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge\".</p> <p>Whatever views one may have about Julian Assange as a WikiLeaks activist, it is clear that in legal and moral terms he cannot properly be described as a refugee. To be a refugee is to be in need of very specific protection, desperately won and deservedly cherished. Refugee protection does not apply to Mr Assange and it is wrong of him to claim it. As Charlie Chaplin said when a Nazi newspaper reporter once asked him in Berlin if he were Jewish, he does not have that honour. But the inappropriate nature of the claim goes further. Since Mr Assange is wanted by the courts in Sweden for the specific and proper purpose of answering two allegations of sexual assault, which is in anyone's language a serious non-political crime, it is also clear that he is specifically disbarred from being treated as a refugee.</p> <p>None of this fundamental aspect of Mr Assange's status was discussed in any serious way on Thursday by the Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, in his long statement on the case in Quito. Mr Pati\u00f1o made plenty of other points before confirming Ecuador's decision to grant asylum to Mr Assange. Most of these were based on the claim that the United States wants to get its hands on Mr Assange because of WikiLeaks, that it may torture him, that his deportation to Sweden by the UK would bring this closer, and that Ecuador has a right to protect him.</p> <p>No one should be na\u00efve about the US, but this is a fallacious chain of reasoning. The US has not said whether it wants to detain Mr Assange, though it has had plenty of time to do so. If it wanted his extradition, the US might logically be more likely to make use of Britain's excessively generous extradition treaty with the US \u2013 which has not happened \u2013 rather than wait until he was in Sweden, when both Sweden and the UK would have to sign off on any extradition application. And neither Sweden nor the UK would in any case deport someone who might face torture or the death penalty. Ecuador's own human rights record is also far from exemplary, as <a href=\" http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-ecuador\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a> has made clear.</p> <p>Yet two wrongs do not make a right. Just as Ecuador is wrong to pretend that Mr Assange is a refugee, so Britain is wrong to threaten to enter Ecuador's London embassy. The Foreign Office may have been factually entitled to remind Ecuador this week that <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/46/pdfs/ukpga_19870046_en.pdf\" title=\"\">a 1987 act</a> allows it, if permissible under international law, to enter the premises. But the<a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-diplomatic-status-ecuador-embassy\" title=\"\"> reminder</a> is more trouble than it is worth, and risks being massively counterproductive to this country's interests in places where fewer scruples apply. The threat was a mistake, allowing Ecuador to shift the argument away from the Swedish criminal charges. Our diplomats in hostile or failing states would be put at unacceptable risk if this threat were carried out.</p> <p>Thursday's events do not change the realities of the Assange extradition case. Mr Assange remains in this country. He is the subject of an extradition order that has been issued under due process. He cannot leave the embassy without being arrested \u2013 an embassy car is not diplomatically protected. Ecuador has found a way to tweak the tail of the imperialist lion, but the law is not on Ecuador's side and, in the end, the law should be upheld. Mr Assange should be extradited to answer Sweden's criminal allegations. In the meantime, Britain should concentrate on being patient and doing the right thing.</p>",
  "<p>After last year's magnificent Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, Ry Cooder returns to the political arena with a vengeance as the race for the White House intensifies. Musically, this is very much a DIY album, with Cooder matching his passionate vocals against his own guitar, bass and mandolin, with his son&#xa0;Joachim on drums. The anger, protest and concern is made all the more effective through his use of humour and unexpectedly upbeat melodies. So the opening Mutt Romney Blues takes a swipe at the Republican candidate from the viewpoint of his mistreated dog, while The Wall Street Part of Town offers cheerful, stomping encouragement to protesters. Then there's the jaunty Brother Is Gone, in which the rich and influential Koch brothers sell their souls to the devil, while Kool-Aid deals with the controversial \"stand your ground\" self-defence law. Best of all, there's Take Your Hands Off It, a rousing defence of&#xa0;constitutional rights, and Cold Cold Feeling, a sympathetic blues for Obama, with the lines \"if you've never been president, you don't know how it feels\".

  "<p>The imperative for all of us who care about politics is not merely to have sound ideas, but to convey them soundly. Few meet either standard well, and that is simply the human condition. Yet the burden on me to that end is immeasurably more than that upon the average person: I write for a living, I communicate professionally and, debatably, I have some effect on policy and politics in my sphere. So when I fail, it tends to be noisily.</p> <p>A sterling example came on 25 June 2011, when I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jstrevino/status/84685322142760960\">posted this on Twitter</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Dear IDF: If you end up shooting any Americans on the new Gaza flotilla \u2013 well, most Americans are cool with that. Including me.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I realise that this statement left a sizable number of people appalled that I, by their reading, urged the Israeli Defense Force to shoot Americans participating in the second incarnation of the Gaza flotilla.</p> <p>I urged no such thing. I intended no such thing. But sufficient numbers believe I did, and in cases of widespread misapprehension of meaning, the fault always lies with the writer.</p> <p>The Gaza flotilla of 2011 was a follow-up to the first one in 2010, in which a collection of activists sought to run the Israeli maritime blockade of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Though their proclaimed intent was merely to facilitate movement of consumer goods by sea, those goods already circulate, albeit imperfectly, through Gaza's land borders with Israel and Egypt. The primary outcome would have been the opening of Gaza's port to the commerce of war: Hamas would have been able to resume uninspected seaborne shipments of arms and ammunition from Iran and elsewhere. (The most famous incident in this vein, the Karine A affair of 2002, was merely one of many.)</p> <p>In this light, the Gaza flotillas sought to render aid to a known terrorist group \u2013 and, in my view, its participants were morally complicit in that. Moreover, in these circumstances, Israel was within its rights to prevent the breach of its blockade and to defend itself by force, if necessary, in so doing.</p> <p>This wasn't simply my interpretation. Two days before my tweet, on 23 June, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the following in a press conference at the department of state:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[W]e do not believe that the flotilla is a necessary or useful effort to try to assist the people of Gaza \u2026 [W]e think that it's not helpful for there to be flotillas that try to provoke actions by entering into Israeli waters and creating a situation in which the Israelis have the right to defend themselves.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was interpreted by <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah\">pro-Palestinian activist Ali Abunimah</a> as \"seem[ing] to lay the ground \u2013 indeed almost provide a green light \u2013 for an Israeli military attack\" on the Gaza flotilla, and he was likely correct. The unmistakable corollary of Secretary Clinton's statement was that any American citizens participating in the flotilla were on their own, and that the United States government would not intervene if they placed themselves in harm's way. In a letter to US Attorney General Eric Holder five days later, Texas Governor Rick Perry, then on the cusp of his presidential candidacy, went a step further, and urged that Americans participating in the flotilla be actively prosecuted.</p> <p>If there is a definition of \"mainstream\" in America's partisan political life, it probably looks something like a position held from the highest levels of the Obama administration to the Office of the Governor of Texas. It is also worth noting that Americans historically take a dim view of their fellow citizens who render aid to their country's enemies \u2013 among whom most Americans would count Islamist terror groups like Hamas. The Obama administration's targeted killing policy has itself extended to US citizens allied with terrorists, as in Yemen.</p> <p>So what I intended to convey, then, was exactly what Hillary Clinton, Rick Perry, and the broad sweep of American opinion historically affirms: that US citizens on the Gaza flotilla of 2011 were responsible for their own fate, and that Americans utterly out of sympathy with their de facto assistance to a terror group would not be moved if the worst befell them.</p> <p>That is what I intended. It is not what I accomplished.</p> <p>In the ensuing Twitter back-and-forth with multiple outraged interlocutors, I focused on defending the rational integrity of my case \u2013 without pausing to consider that it was badly marred by its lack of rhetorical integrity. In succeeding, to my mind, in the sphere of argument, I missed the point: which is to succeed in the sphere of communication. Winning a process victory means little if no one else is convinced. My approach was tailor-made for the Romney campaign, perhaps, but not for the real world.</p> <p>Instead, the widespread impression has arisen that I actively urged the IDF to shoot Americans, that I welcomed their death, or that I hoped for that outcome. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p> <p>I own that I am combative, aggressive, and direct, yes: often intentionally so. I have also lived a life that has attempted, if imperfectly, to render service to my fellow citizens, including by military service and participation in humanitarian aid projects. Above all, I have worked for policies and a society that I believe gives the most hope to the poor, the oppressed, and the marginalized: a society of liberty, in the classical liberal sense, that now goes by the name of conservatism.</p> <p>None of this is to claim I've lived a life of especial virtue. I haven't. But it is to affirm that any reading of my tweet of 25 June 2011 that holds that I applauded, encouraged, or welcomed the death of fellow human beings, is wrong, and out of step with my life and record.</p> <p>Any such reading is also my fault.</p> <p>I do not apologize for my views or my ideology. We must walk in the light we are given as best we may. But for giving the impression that I welcome killing, I do apologize. I was quick, intemperate, and too clever-by-half. I failed as a writer. And that is not the fault of my readers, but of myself.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/joshua-trevi-o\">Joshua Trevi\u00f1o</a>'s first column for Guardian US on Republican politics will appear on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>The verdict was morally abominable \u2013 but inevitable. However bad a law may be, it is not for the courts to make fundamental change but for parliament \u2013 even when parliament sentences thousands a year to brutal and pointless suffering. Most people would surely shudder in sympathy as Tony Nicklinson heard his life sentence today. But in a democracy the high court had no choice but to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19249680\" title=\"\">rule against him and the man known as Martin</a>, both asking for their right to die.</p> <p>This concerns all of us: many will be&#xa0;forced by law to end our days in pain,&#xa0;indignity, humiliation and despair.&#xa0;In silent dying rooms, hidden&#xa0;away in unmentionable and unseen places, thousands gasp out their&#xa0;last, their wishes ignored, unheard, their suffering unrecorded as death notices pretend they \"passed away peacefully\". In any other aspect of&#xa0;life, this would be a scandal.</p> <p>We can only try to imagine Nicklinson's life, but he describes it as \"a living nightmare\". A stroke seven years ago left him paralysed with locked-in syndrome, only able to communicate by blinking. At 58, doctors say he could live another 20 years. In his evidence he said: \"It cannot be acceptable that I am denied the right to take my own life just because I am physically handicapped.\" He asked the court to allow a doctor to give him a lethal injection, since he is unable to commit suicide and couldn't swallow any drugs even if he managed to obtain them. His claim was that denying him respect for his private life (or death) violates the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents\" title=\"\">Human Rights Act</a>.</p> <p>But there was no chance his case would succeed. The director of public prosecutions' guidelines on assisted suicide rule out any help from the medical profession: a doctor would be liable to life imprisonment for murder. Only loved ones acting out of compassion will not be prosecuted if, for instance, they help a relative travel to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, as did the parents of the paralysed young rugby player <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/18/11\" title=\"\">Daniel James</a>: they suffered four months of agonising police&#xa0;investigation afterwards.</p> <p>It made sense for the DPP not to waste taxpayers' money on prosecuting James's parents, but that leaves the law absurdly allowing frightened relatives to try to help someone die, so long as no professional is involved. That can mean horribly bungled attempts. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4625538.stm\" title=\"\">Anne Turner</a> eventually died at Dignitas, but only after she had twice survived suicide attempts at home with a cocktail of drugs and a plastic bag, which badly damaged her organs and caused yet worse suffering. Besides, families can be left haunted: I have met those who say how hard it was to help the mortally ill swallow large quantities of pills with no professional help. In her last weeks, my mother begged us to help her die, but by then she could never have swallowed enough. She wanted to go to Dignitas, but was by then far too weak.</p> <p>The irony of the law is that the dying must kill themselves long before their condition becomes intolerable. In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Death_with_Dignity_Act\" title=\"\">Oregon, where the law allows it</a>, the terminally ill know they can call for an injection whenever they feel they can take no more [see footnote]. That reassurance so eases their anxiety that fewer choose to end their lives. Dignitas has hundreds of British members on their \"waiting list\", but they will have to make that grim journey to a bleak clinic far from home while they may still have months of reasonable life left. Besides, what hypocrisy for the law to allow suicide tourism, while denying medically assisted death at home where people want to die.</p> <p>Martin, the second case rejected today, is also paralysed with locked-in syndrome. He sought a more modest clarification of the guidelines: if&#xa0;he were to starve himself to death, what easement of pain could doctors give without fear of the law? Would they&#xa0;be prosecuted if they failed to section him under the Mental Health Act&#xa0;so as to force-feed him? Or if they help get him to Dignitas?</p> <p>Former lord chancellor Lord Falconer plans a private member's bill for the Lords in January to allow those with a diagnosis of death within 12 months to ask for a lethal prescription. They must administer it themselves in a medical setting, with two doctors certifying they are of sound mind. (For the physically weak, doctors could set up a drip, so long as patients press the button to activate it for themselves.)</p> <p>In opinion polls, for years, more than 80% have supported this change in the law, but every attempt at a right-to-die reform has been sabotaged by the large religious lobby, galvanised by <a href=\"http://www.carenotkilling.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Care Not Killing</a>. The red benches, heavily stacked with the religious, including 26 bishops, saw off the last bills.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9064749/Archbishop-Rowan-Williams-assisted-suicide-could-spell-disaster.html\" title=\"\">Rowan Williams's pretence</a> is that their opposition springs from a fear this will lead to mass extermination of the inconvenient old. But why should the religious worry more about that than everyone else? The law would provide safeguards. The real religious reason is theological, as voiced in the Lords by the bishop of Oxford when he proclaimed \"We are not autonomous beings\" \u2013 we must all wait for God's release. Presumably avoidable suffering is part of God's mysterious purpose.</p> <p>The palliative care profession has been the most effective opponent because of their wonderful work for the dying. But they are strongly religiously motivated and shameless in their pretence that they can ensure everyone always has a pain-free end, if eased naturally out of this world. The brutal truth is that even the best care and drugs don't work in many cases; besides, once faced with death, it's for each of us to decide what we can bear. Less squeamishness in reporting the reality of death would show the barbarous truth about how badly life ends for all too many. When terminally ill, doctors are most likely to kill themselves, knowing too well what lies ahead.</p> <p>Politics often obsesses over trivia compared to this: the Commons has assiduously avoided a debate. Falconer thinks he sees support among newer peers: if they pass his bill, the Commons must at least vote on whether to debate it. But the religious Care Not Killing lobby has threatened MPs with retaliation from all the faiths in their constituencies. <a href=\"http://www.dignityindying.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Dignity in Dying</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.humanism.org.uk/home\" title=\"\">British Humanist Association</a> need all the support they can get to rally parliament.</p> <p>Of all the various harms religions can do, their successful opposition to the right to a peaceful death is one of the most pernicious. Tony Nicklinson asks this: \"The next stroke could affect you. Would you be happy to end up like me?\"</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was appended on 20 August 2012. It is incorrect to state that \"In Oregon, where the law allows it, the terminally ill know they can call for an injection whenever they feel they can take no more\". While the law does allow someone suffering from a terminal disease to end his or her life it does not allow mercy killing by lethal injection or any other means. However, it does allow a person suffering from a terminal disease to voluntarily request a prescription for medication to end his or her life. </p>",
  "<p>Some decent laughs in this very wacky, unpretentious and likable British wedding romcom from director Nigel Cole and screenwriter Tim Firth, who gave us Calendar Girls. The central concept is that we are watching an amateur wedding video, shot and edited by the anarchic best man. The fact that the ferocious mother-in-law at one stage engages a professional videographer allows for plenty of competition gags and cleverly allows Firth and Cole to create \"reverse shot\" scenes, cutting in material supposedly shot by this second crew. Robert Webb plays Tim, a hapless bloke getting married to Saskia (Lucy Punch), a reformed wild child who has submitted to the social aspirations of her posh mother, nicely played by Harriet Walter. Rashly, Tim asks his laddish brother Raif to be the best man: he is played by Rufus Hound, a comic who is in appearance three parts Eddie Izzard to one part Ricky Gervais. Worryingly, Raif turns out to have known Saskia at school; they have some history together, and some dodgy emotional chemistry threatens to derail the whole thing. We get one or two outrageous sight gags and massive \"getting progressively drunk\" montages, and some neatly managed comedy on the laugh-with/laugh-at borderline.</p>",
  "<p>As refugees from General Pinochet's Chile in 1973, when many friends sought refuge in the Swedish embassy in Santiago, with the active help of the then Swedish ambassador, Harald Edelstam, we are horrified that the British government is threatening to use force to enter the Ecuadorian embassy in London to arrest Julian Assange (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum\" title=\"\">Assange's fate in the balance as Ecuador claims UK threatened to storm embassy</a>, 16 August).</p> <p>Even Pinochet and his military gave safe conduct for the thousands of Chilean refugees in the Swedish and other embassies in September 1973, after the military coup against Chile's legitimate President, Salvador Allende. They respected the inviolability of a country's embassy and thousands of Chileans were allowed to leave and start new lives in the country whose embassy they had fled to.</p> <p>Now Sweden is apparently prepared, together with the UK, meekly to do the bidding of the US.</p> <p>If the British government is allowed to get away with this, it will be the end of the universally accepted principle of the inviolability of a nation's embassy on foreign soil. <br><strong>Kate Clark and Ricardo Figueroa</strong><br><em>Stretton, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the tussle over the fate of Julian Assange, the precise scope of the European arrest warrant is yet again in danger of being forgotten. The warrant is an essential crime-fighting instrument in its correct application, which is \"for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution\". This must mean an imminent charge. But the suggestion that it can be used at an earlier, investigative, stage of proceedings keeps coming back. You quote a Foreign Office spokeswoman as saying that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/15/uk-arrest-julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuador\" title=\"\">\"the UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences\"</a> \u2013 whether or not this was a slip of the tongue, it is still an unfortunate mistake.</p> <p>Eurosceptics who oppose the European warrant on illusory grounds of sovereignty are giving a free \"never get into jail\" card to gangsters and traffickers. But misuse of the warrant feeds anti-EU prejudice. It is therefore vital that the national authorities in the EU avoid mission-creep, by using the proper instruments for investigation and evidence-gathering, and reserving the warrent for when matters are ready for prosecution. <br><strong>Sarah Ludford MEP </strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat European justice and human rights spokeswoman </em></p> <p>\u2022 I am alarmed at the suggestion that the UK may use force to enter the embassy of Ecuador. The clarification by the Foreign Office, \"drawing the Ecuadoreans' attention to relevant provisions of our law\", is far from reassuring. The consequences of such an action would open the way for similar action to be taken against our own embassies \u2013 an enormous backward step in international relations. We do not always extradite where we consider that the individual concerned has some legitimate fears and the Ecuadoreans have made the very reasonable suggestion that the Swedish authorities could interview Mr Assange in their embassy. Acting as impartial observers, the Ecuadoreans could surely judge whether the evidence warranted that Mr Assange should be returned to Sweden.<br><strong>Francis Westoby </strong><br><em>Hitchin, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is impossible to believe that the government would threaten the Ecuadorian embassy without massive pressure from the US. In the UK we have the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents\" title=\"\">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</a> to protect whistleblowers. To storm the embassy to arrest Julian Assange would be to act in the manner of the worst dictatorship and would shame us all. As, indeed, does the threat to do so. <br><strong>Jim McCluskey </strong><br><em>Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Britain should stop bullying Ecuador and grant Mr Assange safe passage to Quito, where he should stand trial on any legitimate Swedish criminal charge. <br><strong>Dominic Shelmerdine</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government must be appalled by Ecuador's support for the rights of the individual in the face of demands from a powerful bully.

  "<p>England had the opportunity to nail South Africa from the outset of this deciding Test, and they failed to grasp it, a potentially excellent day for them \u2013 and a fine one in any case for spectators \u2013 ending up as little more than moderate as South Africa slipped the leash.</p> <p>The bowlers, who have thrived over the past couple of years through creating pressure with no let-up, were unable to operate consistently as a unit. There was more than sufficient movement in the air with which the seamers could work and they managed four wickets before lunch, although not without a measure of good fortune allied to some controversial work by the third umpire as from nowhere Steve Finn produced a spell of three for three in seven legitimate deliveries.</p> <p>Maybe the heavy rain shower that fell during the lunch interval and delayed the restart by 15 minutes cleared the air, and certainly the sun came out for much of the afternoon. England managed only one more wicket before tea, and one more before the second new ball became available late in the day, with the fifth, sixth and seventh South African wickets adding 51, 58 and 72 respectively, hauling the side from the depths of 54 for four.</p> <p>The cloud cover returned during the last hour, the second new ball swung even more than first thing and Jimmy Anderson, bowling beautifully now, removed the top scorer, JP Duminy, for 61 with the third delivery with it. Thereafter, the only thing that went out was the power around the south side of the ground, cutting off two of the floodlights and, with the light inadequate, bringing play to a premature conclusion with South Africa 262 for seven \u2013 Vernon Philander 46 not out \u2013 having clawed their way back to parity.</p> <p>If the same conditions remain for the second day, batting is likely to be as much a trial for England as it was for the tourists: this has the makings of a titanic struggle.</p> <p>Andrew Strauss, in his 100th Test, might have been relieved that he lost the toss but was given his preferred outcome: occasionally, when they are really uncertain, captains want to bowl first while not facing the responsibility of so doing. Graeme Smith's inclination is usually to bat, and more so now given the state of the series and the imperative first and foremost to bat England out of contention.</p> <p>England, on the other hand, knew that bowling first gave them their best chance of setting South Africa back, mindful that the Lord's pitch has the reputation of getting easier as the match wears on. With South Africa unchanged through the series, England brought in Jonny Bairstow for Kevin Pietersen (whatever happened to him?) and Graeme Swann in place of Tim Bresnan in the hope that his extra pace would rattle the opposition.</p> <p>Finn duly delivered some velocity, but erratically, and it will not have gone unnoticed that Graham Onions, a bowler admirably suited to thriving in such conditions, had returned to Trent Bridge where he took nine Nottinghamshire wickets, and ran out the other \u2013 intuition plays a part in selection but not alas crystal balls.</p> <p>Until Finn's intervention, South Africa had made a solid start against the moving ball, and had reached 49 for the singular loss of Smith, caught behind from Anderson's sighter from round the wicket. Although the bat was beaten regularly the bowling had been inconsistent, with Stuart Broad no more than steady at medium-fast pace only and Anderson lacking a little rhythm. But if South Africa had weathered the early exchanges, Finn altered things.</p> <p>A short ball to Alviro Petersen was pushed a little too much legside but climbed steeply, clipped his right, bottom, glove and went through to Prior. He considered a review on being given out, having seen a screen replay, but was too late for such considerations: straight away though and, with his hand shown to be fractionally off the handle when the ball struck, he might have been reprieved.</p> <p>The ball which Finn then ripped down the slope and through the defence of Hashim Amla was a contrast to his more untidy offerings. He then claimed Jacques Kallis, in similar fashion to Petersen, but controversial. This time, the umpire Kumar Dharmasena gave the batsman not out, a decision England queried.</p> <p>The numerous replays showed scant evidence to overturn the decision, as protocol demands, and the third umpire Rod Tucker looked to have made an error in so doing: Kallis, who played his first delivery, a similar one from Finn, to fine leg, with his right hand from the bat, was astounded to have done so this time and be given out off that glove. Smith's glare from the balcony would have frozen the Olympic flame.</p> <p>With the ball still hard, and moving nicely, England should have made better of things. Instead, AB de Villiers began the revival by latching on to wayward bowling from Finn, all six of his boundaries coming from that direction, and after Alastair Cook had helped Anderson get rid of him with a fine catch at third slip, Jacques Rudolph and Duminy took advantage as England let things slip further.</p> <p>Only when Swann bowled in tandem with Anderson, in the groove now but woefully short of luck, did England maintain control. Swann claimed his first Test wicket in 91 overs since the end of May, bowling Rudolph for 42, and with the lower order exposed England will have sensed the chance to finish the innings. Thus far Philander has thwarted them.</p>",

Martin Jol then sought to use his Dutch contacts to bring Assaidi to Craven Cottage only for Liverpool to agree a deal that will see the winger become Brendan Rodgers's third summer signing.</p> <p>He is due on Merseyside on Thursday night and should he pass a medical and be registered before noon on Friday, he can go straight into the squad for the Premier League opener at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.</p> <p>Rodgers does not view Assaidi as an immediate first-team starter but someone who will improve his options on both flanks and strengthen the Liverpool squad. The winger has spent his entire professional career in the Dutch leagues and had the choice of playing at international level with Holland or Morocco. He chose the latter, making 22 appearances for his country so far, and was also wanted by Spartak Moscow and Galatasaray before Liverpool made their approach.</p> <p>Rodgers is also pursuing loan deals for Nuri Sahin of Real Madrid and Barcelona's Cristian Tello and said on Thursday that he hopes \"to get one or two in within the next 48 hours\".</p> <p>The Liverpool manager has told Steven Gerrard that he envisages the club captain continuing as an attacking midfielder this season, and the 32-year-old agrees there is no reason to change his game yet. Gerrard has been hampered by serious injury for the past two seasons but having enjoyed a fine European Championship as England captain, he believes it is premature to drop into a deeper role at Liverpool.</p> <p>Gerrard said: \"He's spoken to me about what role he sees me filling. I still think he sees me as an attacking midfielder but as we work through the ages, maybe 33 or 34, then maybe I might be dropping a bit deeper.</p> <p>\"But I don't think anything is going to change in my game this season. I still think I can play a dynamic energy-type game. I'm prepared to adapt, I'll do whatever the manager wants, but I can still play the same way.</p> <p>\"I'm 32. I had major surgery on my groin and I had a big operation on my ankle through bad luck, but they're gone. My groin injuries now are better than they've been from 21-30, so that's the only difference I can see. My figures in the Euros were as good as any player there, so I don't need to sit in front of anyone and say I have to play a different role, I'm thinking of a Paul Scholes role.</p> <p>\"Paul Scholes is four years older than me. I think people want me to say I can't play the same way any more, that I have to go deeper to control the game from deep and play a slower game but believe me, it's not happening, not yet. I'll play the Scholes role when I feel it's time, but it's not time yet. I can play that role no problem, I played it when I was 21, so I can do it when I'm 32-33-34.\"</p> <p>The Liverpool captain admits this campaign represents another period of transition for the club, with Rodgers his fourth manager in four seasons. Gerrard added: \"I think when a new manager comes in it's always a rebuilding process in certain respects. I'm always honest, I'm always realistic. It's impossible to say it's the title this year, people will laugh at me.\"</p>",

  "<p>'Do you know Dennis and Lois?\" asks Justin Young, singer, songwriter and guitarist of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-vaccines\" title=\"\">the Vaccines</a>. \"They used to do merch for the Ramones. They're these New York legends.\" Dennis and Lois, it turns out, have been telling the Vaccines their theories about Johnny Ramone.</p> <p>\"Johnny hated wearing his leather jacket. He saw himself as a businessman and the leather jacket as an opportunity to create a brand. Offstage, apparently, he had been wearing a check shirt and big glasses. He kept all his money in cash and hid it \u2013 Dennis and Lois used to housesit for him and he just shoved all his cash in his records. They don't think he's dead. They're convinced they saw him having a curry. In his favourite Indian restaurant in New York. Wearing exactly the same clothes.\"</p> <p>\"If Johnny Ramone were to fake his own death,\" bass player Arni Hj\u00f6rvar observes, entirely reasonably, \"I'm sure he'd be clever enough to leave New York.\"</p> <p>It's a bit of a relief to meet this loquacious version of Justin Young. Journalists meeting him last year \u2013 when the Vaccines were exploding in a way received wisdom suggested guitar bands no longer did \u2013 often reported him to be shy, defensive and unhelpful; <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/reviews/the-vaccines/11894\" title=\"\">one review of their first album</a> was split between excoriating Young as a person and celebrating his songcraft. Even the Vaccines' publicist, without having been asked, offers reassurance that he is a much happier interviewee these days.</p> <p>Today, at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios, where the Vaccines will later record <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/sessions/2012-07-18_thevaccines\" title=\"\">a live session for Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show</a> in front of an audience of competition winners, Young is both confident and charming, and he's obviously been boosted by the group's success: \"It scares me how easy I find songwriting \u2026 I know we're a great band \u2026 I have more focus than I've ever had in my life.\" Even so, he manages to come off as puppyishly enthusiastic rather than an arrogant bore. Evidently he finds being a rock star easier than he did becoming a rock star.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F55491206%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-J6j19&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F55491206%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-J6j19&show_artwork=true&secret_url=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Vaccines made their London debut in October 2010 at a tiny free show. By the following April, they were headlining two shows at the Electric Ballroom, 150 yards down the road from that first gig, to 1,000 people a night, among them the boys in rugby shirts who throw their pints in the air and the teenagers who decide you are Their Band, and whose patronage turns&#xa0;a band from a cult to a sensation. Come the end of 2011, it was two nights at the 5,000-capacity Brixton Academy. By the start of 2012, their debut album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/10/the-vaccines-album-review\" title=\"\">What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?</a>, had gone platinum \u2013 just as the world was being told guitar music was dead.</p> <p>\"I had always looked down my nose at bands I'd seen accelerate too quickly,\" Young says of the band's ascent. \"I always said: 'Oh, I'm never gonna build my house on sand.' But it was absolutely impossible to stop.\"</p> <p>\"At the time we were trying to stay in control of it,\" Hj\u00f6rvar adds, \"and I&#xa0;think we felt we were in control. But it feels very different now to how it did&#xa0;then.\"</p> <p>\"For someone who's insecure, it's quite an uncomfortable prospect, the idea that people who have never met you and never will are talking about you, not just as a musician, but as a human being,\" Young says. \"I think we&#xa0;were all \u2013 me in particular \u2013 quite uncomfortable, and we were just doing&#xa0;everything we could to slam on&#xa0;the brakes.\"</p> <p>But if they had been able to slam on the brakes, though, they might not have made it here. The fate of any band that generates as much buzz as they did is to be dropped unceremoniously by the anointers of cool. The challenge is to win a wider audience in that time, which is where the beer throwers and the teenagers come in. \"There was this realisation,\" Hj\u00f6rvar says of their new audience, \"and I said: 'Justin, we're not a cool band.'\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bFUKrsDDChE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bFUKrsDDChE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"There was a sudden change, wasn't there,\" Young says of the band's fanbase. \"It was quite an uncomfortable realisation when we realised our fans probably aren't really like us. But you know what? It feels a lot better playing to a room full of people who are happy to throw their beers up in the air than it does to people standing with their arms folded, tapping their feet.\"</p> <p>Out of that ascent has come one of&#xa0;the lead singles from the second Vaccines album, The Vaccines Come of Age. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFUKrsDDChE\" title=\"\">Teenage Icon</a> appears to be Young's mea culpa to those who accused him of&#xa0;being, well, a bit boring, with him singing of being \"reserved and shy/ Your average guy/ No piercing stare/ Just out of shape with messy hair\". In case you hadn't guessed, he is actually \"no teenage icon\". There won't be any more songs like that, Young promises. \"I really hate tour albums or band albums where people are singing about that.\" He croons a snatch of Kiss's babe-it's-lonely-on-the-road ballad <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tET3vtelQ6A\" title=\"\">Beth</a>. \"How can anyone connect with that emotionally? So Teenage Icon was&#xa0;almost a mistake.\"</p> <p>It's difficult to argue that he is trying hard to resist teenage iconhood now though.<strong> </strong>The Vaccines have even adopted a uniform \u2013 from 50 yards away, when I first see them on the street outside the studios, they could not be mistaken for anything bar a rock band. All except Hj\u00f6rvar are wearing denim top and bottom, with Young and lead guitarist Freddie Cowan sporting jackets with the sleeves ripped off. Drummer Pete Robertson, who has kept his sleeves, is so hirsutely transformed I mistake him, embarrassingly, for someone else entirely.</p> <p>\"The way bands look has always for me been a really important part of pop and rock'n'roll music,\" Young says. \"If&#xa0;a band looks good, they're more seductive. It wasn't supposed to look heavy rock. Double denim is symmetrical and timeless and \u2026\"</p> <p>\"Easy,\" offers Hj\u00f6rvar.</p> <p>\"Yeah.\"</p> <p>\"It means you can travel with a tiny suitcase.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uQKjI6395iU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uQKjI6395iU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Young tries to direct the train of thought back to rock'n'roll. \"It does make me feel like I belong to something when all of us are wearing the same thing.\"</p> <p>The moment Young knew the band had hit on something was with the song If You Wanna, which <a href=\"http://www.alternapop.com/2010/08/30/the-vaccines-if-you-wanna-demo/\" title=\"\">circulated online as a demo in summer 2010</a>. \"When we started, it was just a bit of fun,\" Young says. \"We were all a bit depressed. But a mate had a studio and we had a deal that we could go in and use it for free. I thought we were gonna stare at our feet and make 10 minutes of noise. That was the plan. We did If&#xa0;You Wanna and I sang the chorus as&#xa0;a&#xa0;joke, because it was cheesy, but everyone was: 'That was fucking cool.' That's when we thought: why not be a&#xa0;pop band? I remember thinking: 'Enough people are gonna like this that&#xa0;we're gonna be able to headline the Barfly. This is a fucking great pop&#xa0;song.'\"</p> <p>They did like it. And then, as is often the way of things, came the backlash. Young's lyrics were too clunky, some said (\"I like stupid fucking clunky lyrics,\" he responds. \"People probably don't realise how knowingly dumb they are\"). The music was basic and reductive (\"All the pop music I like is young, dumb and primitive. I want to make that kind of music\"). They were artificially inflated by being on the BBC Sound of 2011 shortlist (\"Look back on the other bands who were on the BBC shortlist the year we were. It wasn't exactly the key to the city\"). And they were just braying poshos, part of an aristocratic takeover of British music (\"Let's be honest, we don't have anything in common with those bands we were being compared to\").</p> <p>Young tried to avoid reading too much of what people were saying about him. Not because he doesn't care; he says he finds it too hurtful. He and Hj\u00f6rvar both bemoan a culture that has turned everyone into critics, and which puts bands under intense pressure to deliver something spectacular long before they are ready. \"There's a hunger to have something new every day,\" Young says. \"Guardian New Band of the Day is the perfect example of that. And so bands are in and out of vogue quicker than they have ever been before. If you're being talked about before release and you don't have a record's worth of songs then you've fucking blown it before you've begun. And blogs in particular are to blame for that. Every day they have to post a new band. Are they still listening to the band they posted three weeks ago.\"</p> <p>The Vaccines, however, did have a record's worth of songs, having hidden themselves from view until they did so. \"I'd seen people just fall off cliffs,\" Young says. \"And our thing was: I don't want anyone to hear this until we're ready for people to hear it.\"</p> <p>A couple of years on and the Vaccines have not reinvented themselves so much as turned on the spot, to face 90&#xa0;degrees around from their previous orientation. It's still punky and \u2013 Young's favourite musical self-definition \u2013 primitive, but the musical accents are slightly different, harking more to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI5Lg6tjcFE\" title=\"\">their cover</a> of the garage standard Sometimes Good Guys Don't&#xa0;Wear White than the Ramonic tendencies of their debut (their version, in a deliberate nod, was actually a cover of a cover \u2013 of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tIQscRJ8ds\" title=\"\">Minor Threat's version</a> rather than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwE4OPwer1Y\" title=\"\">the Standells' original</a>). More importantly, the reverb of What Did You Expect has been stripped away, so you can actually hear&#xa0;the band beneath the echo. Cowan, especially, sounds great. That's even clearer when they play live in the studio \u2013 with Young singing straight to the desk and not coming through the speakers, you can hear Cowan's supple, imaginative guitar lines clearly. \"Shredding!\" exclaims Zane Lowe, never knowingly undersold on hyperbole.</p> <p>You can also hear just how simple and timeless the Vaccines sound is: guitar, bass and drums locked into a pattern that sounds immediately familiar but also \u2013 as with the best bands built on the three-chord tradition \u2013 timeless and new. \"It keeps me awake at night because so much comes,\" Young says of his songwriting. \"When we were putting the songs together for the record I had sleepless night after sleepless night because we had too much stuff and I was like: 'What if there's a Baby, I Love You or a Maggie May I've just discarded.\"</p> <p>\"Justin brought in a good 160 songs all together,\" Hj\u00f6rvar says.</p> <p>\"We could do 169 Love Songs. Quite often I'll see an interview with a band and they'll say: 'We had 50 songs,' and I think: 'Is that the best you can do?' I really hope people don't think that about us.\"</p> <p>Now he is convinced of the Vaccines' greatness, Young has a new worry to contend with. What happens when you stop being great? \"I really like the idea of giving it up before it all goes downhill,\" he says, gravely. \"But I also quite like it when bands ride the storm \u2013 they fade into obscurity and then come back. I can't think of a band who've been dignified over a whole career, to be honest. I like seeing people grow old with dignity. I guess someone like Nick Lowe has become more dignified as he gets older. As soon as you are too old for pantomime, you shouldn't really be taking part in pantomime. But it's much easier said than done, isn't it?\"</p>",
  "<p>On a fiercely sunny afternoon in London, Domhnall Gleeson lopes into the hotel courtyard in a blue hoodie and grey jeans, and sticks out a hand to shake mine. The cheerful 29-year-old pulls up a chair in the shade; he is pink and tall and skinny, with a shock of short orange hair in place of the lank locks worn in some of his most widely seen work. (He was Ron Weasley's scarred brother Bill in the final Harry Potter instalments, and a whimpering outlaw in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/13/true-grit-coen-brothers-review\" title=\"\">Coen brothers' True Grit</a>.) He is well known for his well-known father, Brendan Gleeson, who makes such a feast of supporting parts that you wish he got more leads. The same can be said of Domhnall (ignore the 'm' and rhyme it with 'tonal').</p> <p>Though not, perhaps, for much longer. The haircut is for a new movie \u2013 Richard Curtis's latest rom-com, About Time, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/11/rachel-mcadams-richard-curtis-about-time\" title=\"\">Gleeson plays the romantic lead</a>, a time-travelling lawyer, opposite Rachel McAdams. Curtis films tend to do miraculous things for an actor's profile: think of Hugh Grant, Rhys Ifans, Bill Nighy. Does Gleeson feel any trepidation about this? \"Yeah, yeah,\" he says decisively. \"I'll just grow my hair long when the film opens. I'll cope. I mean, I'm not built like a leading man. Richard's taking a bit of a risk casting this face in that role. Conventionally handsome is not really where I'm at.\"</p> <p>The Irish writer-director Tom Hall, who cast Gleeson in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1451632/\" title=\"\">Sensation</a> as a rural lad turned ponytailed pimp, agrees with the actor's assessment of himself.</p> <p>\"Domhnall has a very mutable quality,\" he explains. \"He can look really beautiful on screen one minute and really alarming the next. It makes him very versatile. He gets offered lots of cowards, creeps and sex pests, but he's also an appealing and unconventional romantic lead.\"</p> <p>Gleeson will shortly be seen in two new and dissimilar adaptations: the science-fiction thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jun/22/judge-dredd-remake-karl-urban\" title=\"\">Dredd</a> (\"It's kinda great and pretty full-on,\" he enthuses), based on the 2000AD comic strip, and Joe Wright's lush adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/21/anna-karenina-keira-knightley\" title=\"\">Anna Karenina</a>. In the former, he is a computer whizz whose eyes have been replaced by cameras; in the latter he plays the impassioned nobleman (and Tolstoy surrogate) Levin from behind a copper-wire beard. This month, he also appears in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/25/sundance-2012-shadow-dancer-review\" title=\"\">Shadow Dancer</a> as Connor, an IRA soldier whose sister (Andrea Riseborough) turns informant. With his furtive eyes and ghostly pallor, Connor has been shaped and calcified by vengeance, and Gleeson uses the few scenes he has to make him achingly real.</p> <p>\"Portraying as human the people you hear about on the news doing bad things is dangerous,\" he reflects. \"But it's also necessary and important. And even more important is that the movie is entertaining, which I believe it is. Anything else it's trying to do is bollocks if it's just a statement. I don't want to watch a statement.\"</p> <p>With the exception of Sensation, and the Live Aid drama When Harvey Met Bob, in which he plays Bob Geldof, Gleeson's career has been restricted to detailed miniatures. \"I'd rather do one day on a really cool movie than six months on something crap,\" he explains. \"I'm not going to get better as an actor working on bad stuff.\" When he wants a particular job, he says he goes \"hell for leather\". One audition tape shot on camcorder in a cottage in Ireland won him the part in True Grit; another attracted compliments from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/26/todd-solondz-film-director\" title=\"\">Todd Solondz</a>, who is high on his wish-list of directors to work with. So too is Terrence Malick. \"Rachel McAdams just did a film with him so I've been annoying her on set by going, 'Now what would Terrence do in this situation?' and pestering her for stories.\"</p> <p>Gleeson's short, spotless CV looks especially impressive for someone who doubted he wanted to be an actor at all. His father ditched a teaching job at the age of 34 to pursue acting but Gleeson, the oldest of four boys, has no recollection of tough times in his Dublin childhood. \"You might know you didn't have the coolest trainers but you don't realise it was hard for your parents to get Christmas together some years.\" As a teenager, he gravitated toward writing and directing, determined he didn't want to be defined by his parents: \"No one does.\" He refers to his father admiringly and often, but he'll bristle if someone tries to use that relationship as a stepping stone. \"I get asked to give stuff to my dad,\" he splutters. \"I'm, like, 'I'm not gonna pass your script to him!' You know? My dad's my dad. I'm not his agent.'\"</p> <p>At 16, Gleeson collected an award on behalf of his father; he delivered an acceptance speech full of chutzpah and promptly found himself with an agent. By 19, he was raising the roof in the West End in Martin McDonagh's raucous IRA-themed comedy The Lieutenant of Inishmore. Four years later, he went with the play to Broadway, where he was nominated for a Tony award. But the memories of agonising stretches of unemployment stayed with him. \"As an actor, there's very little you can do if people don't want to see you. Just getting yourself into the room to audition is tough.\"</p> <p>His father had told him that when you're not getting work, you have to make your own. The upshot of this is that Gleeson is now a filmmaker himself, with two shorts, both festival hits, to his name. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE6QhfSv3eQ\" title=\"\">What Will Survive of Us</a> is a clammy comedy about romantic idealism and anal sex. \"I thought it'd be funny,\" he laughs. \"But it's a bit embarrassing when your Dad puts it on in front of your uncles on Christmas Day.\" For the follow-up, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/12429270\" title=\"\">Noreen</a>, he cast his brother Brian, also an actor, and his father as dimwit policemen who turn an open-and-shut suicide into a tableau of Jacobean carnage. Both shorts are characterised by a wistful comic despair; they bode well for the full-length feature he has been writing for the past two years.</p> <p>It might have been finished by now if the acting career hadn't taken off.</p> <p>Following a few months at the start of 2011 that brought the release of True Grit, Sensation and the film of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go, in which Gleeson played one of a community of clones, he could scarcely leave his home without having an award thrust into his hands. He was named a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVlPPvs5gWc\" title=\"\">Shooting Star</a> at the Berlin Film Festival, and a Rising Star by the Irish Film &amp; Television Academy. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgWMz4rnWv8\" title=\"\">Collecting his son's award, Brendan Gleeson joked</a>: \"I'm not so sure about 'rising star'. I could never get him up in the morning.\") IFTA also made him Best Actor for When Harvey Met Bob, though Peaches Geldof provided a lone voice of dissent. \"She hated it,\" laughs Gleeson. \"Which is completely cool. She said I had a leprechaun's accent. I'm bloody Irish! But no, I respect that. I mean, he's her Dad.\"</p> <p>Those who know Gleeson are confident in his future. \"I've kept in touch with Domhnall since Never Let Me Go,\" says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/27/kazuo-ishiguro-interview-books\" title=\"\">Kazuo Ishiguro</a>, \"and I've become really struck not just by his huge and subtle talent, but by his modesty, and the decent way he instinctively treats everyone around him. It's unusual to find a young actor on the brink of stardom so useless at self-absorption. Instead, I get the impression he's always watching and thinking about everything going on around him, with a real understanding of people, and this should serve him well not just as an actor but with his directing and writing ambitions.\"</p> <p>\"Domhnall is probably in two minds about the higher profile he's going to have soon,\" says Hall. \"Lots of young actors in that situation could easily have their heads turned, but his instincts have been unerring.\" For now, Gleeson is having fun with the anonymity he enjoys. (Except in Ireland, where his larky work on the profane TV sketch show <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd8UuhehsXI\" title=\"\">Your Bad Self</a> has made him the sort of star who gets his own punchlines quoted back at him by students.) He tells me he has lost count of the number of strangers who have approached him on location during About Time to ask whether there is anyone famous in the film. \"I usually say, 'Nah. They've got some crap guy off the telly, but apart from that \u2026'\"</p> <p>\u2022 Shadow Dancer opens 24 August, Dredd and Anna Karenina on 7 September.

  "<p>'Time wastes too fast: every letter I trace tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen...\"</p> <p>Thus complains Tristram Shandy, the eponymous narrator of Laurence Sterne's 18th-century novel, which satirically explores the artifice required to capture a life in writing, how one can only create a narrative through omission and addition (\"how much of it he is to cast into a shade \u2013 and whereabouts he is to throw his light\") and, most of all, the way that real time will always overtake narrative time.</p> <p>This brings us, obviously, to \"Jennifer Aniston\". Not Jennifer Aniston the actual person, whose heart's desires and emotional needs are known only to the very few, but the fictional character \"Jennifer Aniston\", whose every passing thought and sexual encounter is instantly communicated by the world's media thanks to various \"sources\" and \"unnamed friends\".</p> <p>\"Jennifer Aniston\" \u2013 or Poor Jen, to use the shorthand \u2013 was coined back in 2005 when the real-life Aniston's husband, Brad Pitt, was stolen in the dead of night by the Bad Witch Angelina Jolie, who ripped the helpless Pitt from his marital bed, threw him across her black steed and galloped away to hurl him into her sex dungeon, leaving Poor Jen with nothing to do but spend every waking hour Desperately Searching For Love (some of that tale may be truer to \"Jennifer Aniston\" than Jennifer Aniston). While Aniston herself appeared to live, by any sentient person's standards, a damn good life post-2005 \u2013 earning gazillions of dollars, going on holidays with girlfriends and dating handsome men \u2013 Poor Jen was deemed a modern-day Gollum, wide eyed and skeletal, tearing through the eligible men of the western world only to discard them over her shoulder like animal bones sucked dry of meat as she searched in vain for her Precious, now in the possession of Baggins Jolie.</p> <p>No matter how often Aniston issued statements to the contrary, Poor Jen, according to the agreed media narrative, was \"desperate\" for marriage, \"desperate\" for children, so \"desperate\" that she scared men away with her overwhelming odour of desperate desperation. Never mind that no halfway intelligent woman \u2013 as Aniston has always appeared to be, despite her awful film choices and her <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2144959/Jennifer-Aniston-turns-clocks-youthful-black-white-Glaceau-advert.html\" title=\"\">decision to shill for something called Smart Water</a> \u2013 with a craving for marriage would keep company with pretty-boy douchebag John Mayer, as Aniston did for a year. Never mind that Aniston has always given the impression of being pretty happy with her lot. In medialand, Poor Jen's parental and marital status define her as both perverse and tragic.</p> <p>Aniston, more than any other female celebrity, has proven that in many corners of the western world feminism simply hasn't happened. And so, while the media insisted that Jolie and Poor Jen completely detest one another, it was the media that appeared the most determined to destroy Poor Jen, bullying her with pity.</p> <p>Aniston occasionally expressed bafflement at how this narrative had developed, but the reason is simple. Celebrities think their job is to make movies, write albums, and so on. Actually, it is to be photographed by the paparazzi. From these photographs, celebrity journalists write little narratives around them \u2013 you know, like those photo casebook studies in the Sun, featuring various anxious-looking folk bedecked with fretful speech bubbles \u2013 and Aniston's narrative was that she was insane with loneliness.</p> <p>As in politics, so in celebrity, in that once a narrative becomes established (George Clooney is a glamorous ladykiller, Keanu Reeves is an airhead), the press sticks to it tenaciously. So established is this view of Aniston that it has moved out of its hot pink niche of celebrity journalism and into the bright lights of the news media, with the London Evening Standard reporting on its page three only last week that Aniston stole her latest paramour, Justin Theroux, from his previous girlfriend, having, the paper avowed with its intimate knowledge of the situation, \"pursued him\". Selfish, desperate Poor Jen. And, oh, those poor helpless menfolk, the likes of Pitt and Theroux so vulnerable to deranged females who steal them away from their rightful lady partners.</p> <p>Thus, when the latest issue of America's Star magazine appeared with the cover line \"IT'S OVER!\" beneath photos of Theroux and Aniston and further \"exclusive photos of the night they split\" inside, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Indeed, so familiar was this story that Star's claim that this was a WORLD EXCLUSIVE and ONLY IN STAR seemed improbably optimistic. And so it proved, as it is also on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/14/jennifer-aniston-grazia\" title=\"\">the front of the current issue of Grazia</a>. In the article inside, Grazia confidently quotes the usual unnamed friends who assure the magazine, \"It's pretty much all been over\", and, \"It's looking fairly unlikely they'll survive the next few weeks\", blaming Theroux's \"lack of commitment\". So far, so Poor Jen.</p> <p>Except, this week, an unexpected problem arose.</p> <p>\"Write as I will, and rush as I may into the middle of things, [\u2026] I shall never overtake myself,\" claimed Tristram Shandy.</p> <p>But on this point Aniston differs from Shandy because she did overtake herself, or at least overtook Poor Jen, because by the time Grazia and Star were sitting in the newsstands, Aniston's publicist had announced that Aniston and Theroux were not broken up. They are engaged.</p> <p>Not that the media were going to give up their beloved Poor Jen without a good ol' fight. Most gossip media outlets noted that Pitt and Jolie's wedding is allegedly imminent and thus Aniston is clearly trying to \"outdo\" them (never mind that it was Theroux, not Aniston, who did the proposing and was therefore in control of the timing). There was a general expression of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/jennifer-aniston-engaged_n_1778734.html\" title=\"\">condescension disguised as relief</a> that Poor Jen had \"finally found Mr Right\". A certain British tabloid that need not be named trumpeted on the front page, \"Aniston to wed at 43\", in the way that others might say: \"Peter Andre to be the head of Mensa with an IQ of 17.\" Needless to say, it is unlikely that Pitt's marriage will be discussed with references to his age (49). Inside, like the worst kind of best man's speech, the paper celebrated Aniston's happiness with a double-page spread of her \"dating disasters\", including three photos of her ex-husband.</p> <p>So is this farewell to Poor Jen, that media construct that has proven so useful for insinuating that any woman is a failure, no matter how brilliant her life appears to be, if she doesn't have a husband and seven children? Don't be absurd. We can now look forward to tales of Poor Jen being a \"bridezilla\", her \"baby agony\" and every other allegation the tabloid press likes to throw at famous women as punishment for being female. But the narrative for Poor Jen has definitely changed.</p> <p>So is there another famous woman who can pick up that mantle? Another who can be pilloried for no longer being in a tabloid-friendly relationship? One who can be trailed by paparazzi in the hope of catching her making an awkward expression that will be translated as longing for a love that once was?</p> <p>Hello, Kristen Stewart.</p>",
  "<p>Julian Assange's circus has pulled off another breathtaking stunt: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-political-asylum-ecuador\" title=\"\">he has won&#xa0;political asylum in Ecuador</a>. Assange's flight from Sweden, a decent democracy with a largely excellent justice system, takes ever more absurd&#xa0;forms. After the decision of Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, the Swedish Twitterverse filled&#xa0;with mocking jokes.</p> <p>Assange has few fans left here. On the contrary, his unholy alliance with Ecuador's political leadership casts a shadow over what was, despite everything, his real achievement: to reveal shattering news through the revolutionary medium of WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Pati\u00f1o praised Assange as a fighter for&#xa0;free expression, and explained that&#xa0;they had to protect his human rights. But Ecuador is a country with a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/in-tiny-ecuador-populist-president-restrains-press/2012/01/23/gIQAHBmQNQ_story.html\" title=\"\">dreadful record</a> when it comes to freedom of expression and of the press. Inconvenient journalists are put on trial.&#xa0;Private media companies may not&#xa0;operate freely.</p> <p>President Rafael Correa is patently unable to tolerate any truths that he does not own. <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/\" title=\"\">Reporters Without Borders</a> has strongly and often criticised the way that media freedoms are limited in Ecuador. Assange is a plaything for the president's megalomania.</p> <p>Most of the women in Sweden who dare to report experiences of sexual assault to the police, despite the exposure that this brings, will find that the case is dropped because it is her word against his, and the other evidence is slight or non-existent. That is quite probably what would happen in this case, if Assange only dared come to Sweden for questioning. There is no reason to believe the fantastic conspiracy theories which say that the women's accusations are just a way to get at Assange.</p> <p>The press chief of the Swedish foreign ministry said on Thursday that the fear of Ecuador's foreign minister that Assange would be sent on to the US by the Swedes, and even be executed, are utterly groundless. Both Swedish law and Sweden's obligations under the European convention on human rights mean Assange could not be extradited to the US if he were wanted for a crime which might lead to the death penalty.</p> <p>There is a Swedish extradition treaty with the US, but the process of extradition is long and very complicated. So far there is not even a charge against Assange in the US, which would be the first step in the process. We don't even know that the American justice system wants to try Assange.</p> <p>Ironically enough, it would probably be easier for the Americans to get&#xa0;Assange from England, since the two&#xa0;countries are much closer to each other in many ways. But it's been a very&#xa0;long time since Assange did anything sensible.</p> <p><em>This article was translated by Andrew Brown</em></p>",
  "<p>We all want our children to succeed, don't we? What many of us overlook, however, is that allowing them to fail is an important part of any future success. London 2012 saw Team GB achieving remarkable success but among the medal winners were those who failed to live up to expectations (both theirs and ours).</p> <p>Athletes, however, are more able to handle failure than the schoolchildren studying for exams in the high-pressure environment of compulsory education. This is perhaps in part due to the massive commitment world class athletes need in order to stay at the top of their game, but is also down to the work carried out by sports psychologists, who played an important role in the success of British athletes. The difference is that top athletes are often as familiar with their mental states as they are with their physical capabilities.</p> <p>Note that I have no issue with the use of the oft-derided term fail, for without failure there would be no success, would there? Fail is not a popular word in education, even if you have failed your A levels you will still be awarded an unclassified \u2013 it's as if the word itself would make failure inevitable. Of course athletes know how to deal with failure because they have a greater understanding of their own personal psychology, which in turn leads to greater mental strength (to add to their obvious physical strength) and a higher level of psychological resilience.</p> <p>Many of us (both pupils and those involved in education) remain relatively ignorant of the link between psychology and success, assuming that, for example, our intelligence is of fixed, innate and unchangeable quantity. In fact, adolescent intelligence (as measured by IQ scores) fluctuates considerably, leading Angela Duckworth (an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania) to conclude that academic success is more to do with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaeFnxSfSC4\">motivation and grit rather than to being born bright</a>.</p> <p>Abilities are therefore flexible rather than fixed. Stanford University psychologist <a href=\" http://mindsetonline.com/\">Carol Dweck</a> believes that success and failure are determined by what the individual understands about himself or herself, dividing the world into those who have fixed mindsets and those with growth mindsets.</p> <p>Fixed 'mindsetters' are of the opinion that success and failure are somehow genetically programmed into us so that the child who believes themselves to be unintelligent will never be able to succeed academically; more worrying is that those teachers with a fixed mindset employ their own preconceptions and prejudices and transfer them onto those who fulfil the requirements of the successful student or the failure.</p> <p>Contrast this with the growth 'mindsetter'. Dweck found that teaching young children about the way in which the brain learns actually made them more likely to succeed in academic tests. A growth mindset allows us to believe that our intelligence is a fluid entity and we have great control over how intelligent we are and how successful we can be. Those with a growth mindset view failure as a temporary stop on the way to success, in the same way that an Olympic cyclist views missing out on a medal as an opportunity to assess, improve and get that gold medal next time around.</p> <p>If success is within our personal control then the way in which we praise pupils should reflect this view. Praising innate abilities (\"You're very clever\") leads to a fixed mindset (as does telling a child that they provided a very good answer even if the answer was completely wrong), praising the effort, on the other hand, makes success about hard work rather than something that is given. Pointing out how and why failure has occurred should be seen as part of the learning process, rather than an end in itself. Failure should be seen as an opportunity to grow and should never be brushed under the carpet in order to conceal our embarrassment or shame.</p> <p>So, let's hear it for failure. You're just one more step on the road to success.</p> <p>Marc Smith teaches A level psychology at a secondary school in North Yorkshire and is a member of the GTN teacher panel.

In a lengthy judgment Mr Justice Royce added that the cases gave rise to \"the most profound ethical, moral, religious and social\" issues.</p> <p>\"No one could fail to be deeply moved by the terrible predicament faced by these men struck down in their prime and facing a future bereft of hope,\" he said. \"Some will say the judges must step in to change the law. Some will be sorely tempted to do so. But the short answer is that to do so here would be to usurp the function of parliament in this classically sensitive area.\"</p> <p>In upsetting scenes following the judgment Nicklinson's wife, Jane, stood by her husband at their home in Melksham as he shook with sobs. She described the judgment as one-sided and disappointing.</p> <p>\"All the points that we put forward have just really been ignored, it seems. You can see from Tony's reaction he's absolutely heartbroken. We always knew it was a big ask but we always hoped that the judges would see sense, but clearly they haven't.\"</p> <p>They hoped to organise an appeal hearing before the end of the year and if that failed, she said, \"Tony either has to carry on like this until he dies from natural causes or by starving himself\".</p> <p>After the ruling, Nicklinson said in a statement issued by his lawyer that he was devastated by the decision.</p> <p>\"Although I didn't want to raise my hopes it happened anyway, because a fantastic amount of work went into my case and I thought that if the court saw me as I am, utterly miserable with my life, powerless to do anything about it because of my disability, then the judges would accept my reasoning that I do not want to carry on and should be able to have a dignified death,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I am saddened that the law wants to condemn me to a life of increasing indignity and misery.\"</p> <p>Speaking for Nicklinson, Paul Bowen QC said: \"Tony has now had almost seven years to contemplate his situation. With the continuing benefits of 21st-century health and social care, his life expectancy can be expected to be normal: another 20 years or more. He does not wish to live that life.\"</p> <p>He was being condemned to live without dignity by the law on assisted suicide and euthanasia, which did not stop the \"widespread practice of euthanasia, but has forced it underground\", he said.</p> <p>Unlike Nicklinson, Martin wanted volunteers to help him make plans to end his life, but under recent guidelines from the DPP only family members or close friends motivated by compassion are deemed unlikely to be prosecuted for assisting a suicide.</p> <p>Martin's wife has said that she could not be involved in his death, while respecting his wishes and wanting to remain by his side \"to the end\".</p> <p>His lawyers said they would now discuss with their client whether to launch an appeal. In a statement released by his lawyer, Martin said that he felt \"even more angry and frustrated\" following the judgment.</p> <p>\"My life following my stroke is undignified, distressing and intolerable. I wish to be able to exercise the freedom which everyone else would have: to decide how to end this constant tortuous situation.\"</p> <p>The ruling was welcomed by \"pro-life\" campaigners. Dr Andrew Fergusson, of Care Not Killing, said the judgment had come as no surprise as it had been described in court as a \"full-frontal assault on the law of murder\".</p> <p>\"[The ruling] confirms the simple truth that the current law exists to protect those without a voice: the disabled, terminally ill and elderly, who might otherwise feel pressured into ending their lives.\"</p> <p>Paul Tully, general secretary of the group SPUC Pro-Life, said: \"We welcome the high court's ruling and we question whether those who have encouraged Mr Nicklinson and Martin to pursue this legal action have the best interests of disabled people at heart. We urge those around them to rise to the challenge of helping them realise their value and overcome their sense of hopelessness. We trust that today's judgment will help end the insidious campaign in the British courts to change the law on assisted suicide and euthanasia.\"</p> <p>The pro-euthanasia campaigner Dr Antony Lempert, a GP and chairman of the Secular Medical Forum, said the decision left Nicklinson with a terrible choice. \"Because other people regard his tortured life as somehow sacred, or are fearful of societal consequences, he is forced to endure his suffering or take desperate measures to end it.</p> <p>\"With no hope now of a quick release, he must choose between this torment and the torment of allowing his family to stand by and watch him starve himself to death.\"</p> <h2>Locked-in syndrome</h2> <p>People with locked-in syndrome are usually completely paralysed, unable to move or do anything for themselves, yet entirely aware of what is happening around them and their own situation.</p> <p>Victims of the condition are unable to speak but may, like Nicklinson, be able to communicate via blinking or moving their eyes. The syndrome can result from brain injury, diseases of the circulatory system, damage to nerve cells or medication overdose.</p> <p>Although there is no cure, therapy can sometimes benefit victims. One type of therapy, functional neuromuscular stimulation, uses electrodes to stimulate muscle reflexes, and according to experts may help activate some paralysed muscles. In rare cases some patients may regain certain functions, but the chances for motor recovery are very limited.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> We need to talk about cricket. At a few seconds past 11am (they're never on time these days), a gentleman will shout 'play'. Another gentleman will bowl a lump of leather as fast as possible, and a third gentleman will attempt to repel it with his trusty willow. Briefly, all will be well with the world. Cricket regularly provides respite or sanctuary \u2013 whether it's from work, life, your inability to stop whistling Pocket Full of Sunshine by Natasha Bedingfield, or the nagging fear that the spot on your face is much more visible to your chosen sex than you would like (yes, it is). Today we need cricket to provide respite from <em>cricket</em>, or at least the increasingly dispiriting events of the last fortnight. For the next five days, we can concentrate on the good stuff: bat 'n' ball rather than tweets 'n' texts. And woe betide the first person who mentions Piers Morgan.</p> <p>It's almost been lost in the shadow of what must never, ever, ever be called textgate or KPgate or Badgergate or anything with a gate, but this is a rather important Test match. In fact it's huge, so huge that, were Blackadder a cricket fan, he'd be off on one about Hugh McHuge, who's just been appointed professor of hugeness at Oxford University. </p> <p>England have no option but to win. If they do, they stay No1 in the world and their decision to drop Kevin Pietersen will be seen to be vindicated (even though, in reality, the result of this match has nothing to do with whether it was the right decision or not). If they don't, South Africa become officially the best side in the world.</p> <p>It's England's biggest match at home since the final Ashes Test of 2009, when a team without Pietersen \u2013 and, as now, given approximately no chance by many pundits \u2013 famously beat Australia to regain the Ashes. It's crazy to write off their chances here, although a good start is essential and they will have a helluva job taking 20 wickets on a pitch that usually saps bowlers' souls for kicks.</p> <p>Perversely, taking precisely no wickets on the first day \u2013 by winning the toss, batting first and batting long \u2013 would be the best place to start. After all the nonsense of the last 10 days, watching every last forward defensive of a Jonathan Trott marathon would feel positively orgiastic.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>A special guest will ring the bell for the start of play at Lord's today</strong>. It's not Piers Morgan. It's not, as was suggested, Usain Bolt. It's not Jessica Ennis. It's not even Natasha Bedingfield. But it is Yohan Blake, and that's pretty cool.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>A quick message to Andrew Strauss ahead of his 100th Test</strong></p> <p>1. Congratulations. You're one of the classier human beings to have played the game, and were a seriously good player before the captaincy started to have its inevitable impact on your batting and your hairline. We all love you dearly.</p> <p>2. Winthetossandbatwinthetossandbatpleasewinthetossandbat.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss</strong> and will bat first. That's not good news for England on what looks a cracking wicket. Mind you Andrew Strauss, who knows almost as much about cricket as me, says it's \"not a bad toss to lose\" because of a green tinge to the pitch.</p> <p>England make two changes, with Jonny Bairstow replacing Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann coming in for Tim Bresnan. I'd have gone for five bowlers, but it was never likely to happen. South Africa \u2013 horror, shock \u2013 are unchanged. </p> <p><strong>England</strong> Strauss (c), Cook, Trott, Bell, Taylor, Bairstow, Prior (wk), Broad, Swann, Anderson, Finn.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Petersen, Smith (c), Amla, Kallis, de Villiers (wk), Rudolph, Duminy, Philander, Steyn, M Morkel, Tahir.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The Tom Maynard Trust</strong> A couple of months on, the death of Tom Maynard still makes no sense at all. His family have launched the Tom Maynard Trust, as Jon Surtees at Surrey CCC explains.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://bit.ly/MYao3s\">The Tom Maynard Trust</a>, a charity organised by Tom's family in his memory, is being launched next week at the Kia Oval. As part of the launch, his father Matthew is leading a sponsored peloton of cyclists from Cardiff to London \u2013 also including Andrew Flintoff, Steve James and Surrey Chairman Richard Thompson \u2013 arriving at the Kia Oval shortly before the match between Surrey and Glamorgan on Tuesday (August 21) that will act as the launch of the charity.</p> <p>To raise awareness and boost the launch, we are hoping to bring together members of the cricketing community from around the world to tweet the same message simultaneously at 11am (GB Time) on Monday August 20th. We are looking to get as many fans, players, coaches, organisations etc.. as possible to back this so it really takes over the feeds of cricket fans and raises awareness on a massive level.</p> <p>The message is as follows: Tom Maynard was a great man and a great cricketer.

Where were you two weeks ago, eh. Even Gary Naylor deserted me. You sicken me, all of you.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>It's a proud day for both captains</strong>. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;page=2;template=results;type=batting\">Andrew Strauss becomes the 57th man to play 100 Tests</a> (and the first to do so having made his debut after his 27th birthday), while Graeme Smith jumps above another granite-willed southpaw Pom-basher, Allan Border, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?captain=1;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;template=results;type=batting\">to become the most capped captain in Test history</a>.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Woe betide Emma John department</strong> \"I've recently emerged from an Olympics-induced hypersleep to discover that somehow Piers Morgan is involved in the KP affair. Just how long was I out? Did I miss a leadership coup at the ECB?\"</p> <p>Yeah, the England captain Piers Morgan is playing his 100th Test in the match between Europe and Australasia at the Kentucky Fried MCG today. How long have you been asleep?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>The good news for England</strong> is that there's a bit of cloud cover in north London. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;ground=10;orderby=batting_average;template=results;type=batting\">The bad news is that Graeme Smith averages 84 million on this ground</a>. Yohan Blake becomes the first non-cricketer ever to ring the bell at Lord's, and now it's time for some actual cricket.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Smith 1, Petersen 0)</strong> It'll be Anderson to Smith, with three slips, a leg-side ring and only one man in front of square on the off side. England have had more theories for Graeme Smith in this series than George Costanza had for meeting women. His were <strike> more successful </strike> less unsuccessful. There's some encouraging early inswing for Anderson, and Smith gets off the mark with a single into the covers.</p> <p>\"What do you think about Jonny Bairstow coming in, Rob?\" says Jonathan Wood. \"Surely his (limited) Test chances so far suggest he's too green for this match. I'm not sure where else you'd go, though \u2013 I presume Bopara's 'personal reasons' mean he's still not available? Collingwood would have fitted the bill nicely right now.\" I'd have picked five bowlers but, as I said, that was never going to happen. Bob Willis advocated Rob Key on Sky the other night. Bob Willis is a wise man.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 4-0 (Smith 2, Petersen 2)</strong> Stuart Broad needs to bowl as he did on the final day at Headingley, with fire, brimstone and a full length. Petersen drives a couple through the covers before being beaten by a fine outswinger.</p> <p>\"I'm probably alone, but I don't think not winning this match and the consequent losing of #1 status is necessarily a bad thing,\" says Andy Smith. \"Seems we're a bit too keen to say we're No1 than get on the pitch and prove it, what is it? Four wins in the last 11 Tests? Maybe having to go out and regain top dog status might be a good thing.\" I know what you mean. Three wins in ten this year. You do wonder if there's something in the English sporting psyche that struggles to cope with the expectation of success. I mean look at the Olympics! I hope England win here, though, because if they fail to win, and then lose in India, an era could end pretty quickly. Look what happened to the 2005 side that was supposed to take over the cricket world, cure baldness and ensure we all live happily ever after.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 5-0 (Smith 3, Petersen 2)</strong> There is encouraging swing for both bowlers, and Petersen's attempted on-drive ends with a leading edge towards mid off. Early wickets are so important, psychologically as much as anything. If South Africa are 80 for none at lunch, England will find it pretty hard not to feel sorry for themselves.</p> <p>\"Look can we just not mention him?\" says Rory Taylor. \"I could fill a library with how much I despise him but he is such a sick, psychotically dependent, attention junkie that he would actually shrivel up &amp; die if we all ignored him. So it goes without saying what we should all do.\" Look, that's no way to talk about Rob Key. Honk! Honk with me now. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 10-0 (Smith 4, Petersen 6)</strong> Smith takes a really dodgy single down the ground, slowly revving up his big unit as Finn runs round from mid on to collect and throw underarm at the stumps. Had he hit, Smith would have been gone. England have to take those half chances. Okay it's probably more a three-eighths chance but that doesn't exactly roll of the tongue does it. Petersen drives a Broad outswinger through mid off for the first boundary. England won't mind that; they have to take the risk of inviting the drive early on.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 11-0 (Smith 5, Petersen 6)</strong> Petersen inside edges a big inswinger from Anderson onto his pads. This is a big hour for England because the ball is doing a fair bit. Another inside edge plops safely on the leg side. There's no short leg although it wouldn't have gone to him anyway. Anderson completes an outstanding over by beating Petersen with a sensational outswinger.</p> <p>\"So, will the England performance be able to step out from the shadow of the selection controversy that is plaguing the side before play has started?\" says Josh Robinson. \"I'm talking, of course, of the indirect dropping of Tim Bresnan for Steven Finn. Was Swann only 'rested' at Headingley so that this decision could be made in the guise of two tactical changes? I think we should be told.\" I'll text some of the lads in the dressing room to find out, although I'll be sure to couch the question in some banter just in case.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 14-0 (Smith 7, Petersen 7)</strong> Broad swings a shortish delivery back in to Smith, who wears it in the breadbasket. He doesn't rub it, although I think I saw the ball wince.</p> <p>\"I respect Graeme Smith greatly (he'll be delighted to know this),\" says Steven Pye. \"He is a tough cricketer, an impressive captain, but must he make my life a total misery? Can't he just get out quietly one day whilst scoring a scratchy 3? Every time he walks out to bat against us I automatically assume he is going to make an unbeaten double hundred. I've had enough.\" The odd thing is that his record v England in South Africa isn't that great \u2013 he averages a <em>pathetic</em> 43.50&#xa0;\u2013 but over here he is as grimly inevitable as banter on a chat show.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 20-0 (Smith 13, Petersen 7)</strong> Anderson is bowling beautifully, but it would seem Dame Fortune has a cob on with him for some rason. Smith is beaten by a monstrous outswinger, edges another along the ground for four, and is beaten again off the last ball of the over.</p> <p>\"With all the brouhaha about Pietersen in the build-up to this test match there hasn't been much coverage of how SA feel about potentially becoming the No 1 side,\" says Max Tant. \"Has there been any mention of their perceived, or otherwise, tendency to choke when on the cusp of glory? Will it affect them in a Test match environment? What will happen if they need one run to win with only one wicket left (not likely now they're batting first, but who knows)?\" </p> <p>It feels a bit different this time. They look calm and ready, although they have had some daft collapses in the last year. They have actually been No1 before, but only for four months in 2009. They lost the No1 ranking without playing a game. <em>Bottlers</em>.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 22-0 (Smith 14, Petersen 8)</strong> England have got to get rid of Smith. He's such a distraction, and so intimidating, that psychologically it would be worth a lot more than one wicket.</p> <p>\"Thought Patrick Eagar the photographer once rang the bell at Lord's?\" says Dom O'Reilly. \"He's not a cricketer.\" Ah, you might be right. As with 99.94 per cent of the OBO, I nicked that off Sky.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 22-1 (Smith c Prior b Anderson 14)</strong> The beast has been slain! Graeme Smith is out! He chased a wide, very full delivery from Anderson \u2013 the first bowled from around the wicket \u2013 and England were certain he snicked it to Matt Prior. The umpire Kumar Dharmasena said not out and, although England reviewed straight away, it seemed the relevant noise was bat on ground rather than ball. Smith's bat <em>did</em> hit the ground \u2013 it bashed it, in fact \u2013 but he outside edged the ball almost simultaneously. Some wickets are bigger than others. That is a very big wicket.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 22-1 (Petersen 8, Amla 0)</strong> \"When was the last time we had two unproven (say having played collectively less than 10 Tests) batsmen in our top six?\" says Matt Biss. \"In a funny way it might help Taylor and Bairstow that the other's there; neither will have to shoulder the burden of being the new kid on what is circumstantially a pretty pressurised block, feeling like the solitary rabbit in the headlight.\" Good question. Bopara and Shah in the Caribbean in 2009? The last time at home \u2013 and in a really big Test \u2013 might have been the 2005 Ashes, with Bell and Pietersen.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Petersen is content to drive despite the swinging ball, and puts Broad away for another boundary through mid off. Broad has a huge shout for LBW later in the over. Simon Taufel says not out and, although Broad is desperate to review \u2013 he's almost like Renton in Trainspotting; I JUST NEED ONE MORE REVIEW, YOU \u00a3*&amp;! \u2013 Strauss and Prior think otherwise. Hawkeye shows they were right, as it was missing. An eventful over concludes with a jaffa that swerves past Petersen's defensive push.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/.a/6a00d83451c45669e20120a5ddcabc970c-500wi\">England fielders celebrate the wicket of Graeme Smith</a>,\" honks Daniel Harris. Honk with him now. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Finn replaces Anderson. This is a big match for him because he hasn't been at his best in his two Test appearances this summer. He starts with a sharp maiden, including a fine delivery that jags back sharply to slam into Amla's stomach.</p> <p>\"Vic Marks' piece in the Guardian yesterday had several hundred comments below it in support of KP,\" says Brett. \"Many reckon there is one rule for him, another for the likes of Swann and Broad. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.\" I don't really have many thoughts, about anything. It's such a difficult thing to judge without knowing all the facts, so I can't quite understand why so many people have been so strident. Things I do think: it's very sad and pretty unseemly, Twitter is evil, KP has been a fool but is surely not the only one at fault, and Strauss and Flower have behaved publicly with a class and dignity I'd quite like to call my own. That's about it. Ultimately, I'm sitting on the fence and citing ignorance.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Petersen has a disgusting windy woof at an inviting wide outswinger from Broad. Fresh air flies for four; the ball goes through to Matt Prior. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Morning Rob, morning sportsfans,\" says Nick Barrett. \"All this talk about getting Smith out is right. South Africa are essentially a one-man team and he has certainly carried them through this series. Amla is essentially an No8 batting up the order at No3 and after him we are into their tail of Kallis, de Villiers et al who are infamously easy to skittle...\" The West Indies team of the 80s had Greenidge, Haynes, Richardson, Hooper and Logie but the wicket of Viv was still worth two or three psychologically.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 27-1 (Petersen not out 12)</strong> Finn has started really well and has a big shout for LBW against Petersen, crabbing around a nipbacker. It looked high and Andrew Strauss decides not to review. Hawkeye supports Strauss's judgement again. There's a much better shout next ball from a similar but slightly fuller delivery. Kumar Dharmasena thought about it for ages before saying not out \u2013 and England have reviewed it. Here comes the replay ... and it was going over the top. Bah. That's always the danger with a giant like Finn.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 27-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 1)</strong> A fine start from Finn: 2-1-1-0. \"Strauss needs to grow up,\" is the subject of Tim Cadman's email. \"Anyone else think Strauss and England are being hugely over-sensitive about Pietersen and his texts? Sure he said a few bad words about 'Straussy', but is that enough to refuse to pick by far the best batsman in the country? They're not paid to like each other, they're paid to win and they have a much better chance of doing that with Pietersen in the team.\" Nup, because I don't know the full facts. I'm pretty sure it's about a lot more than a couple of text messages though.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 31-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 5)</strong> Anderson switches ends to replace Broad. His second is driven masterfully through the covers for four by Amla. The response is a peach that swings past the edge. This is terrific cricket.</p> <p>\"A slight correction to Brett's description of the comments on the online version Vic Marks's piece in the comic yesterday,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Glancing at those comments reveals a frenzy of the tinfoil hat brigade, seeing in everything a conspiracy on the part of Strauss and Flower to force Pietersen out of the team, the nadir arguably being the claim that someone in the ECB or England hierarchy wanted to make sure that it was Cook rather than Pietersen who beat Gooch's record. A longer look (for it made oddly compelling reading) revealed that regularly someone would come in and express a relatively considered view that expressed some criticism of Pietersen, often also of other parties, only to be set upon by the horde of conspiracy theorists, and then leave the discussion. Meanwhile, the nutjobs would congratulate themselves on the fact that everyone was in agreement, and that they'd reached the definitive conclusion. It's a good job this sort of behaviour is confined to the comments threads on blogs, and that human beings don't ever act like that in other walks of life.\" With the obvious exception of the bits where people say how great I am, comment sections on the internet have largely been a disaster.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 39-1 (Petersen 20, Amla 5)</strong> Petersen gets consecutive boundaries off Finn, flicking full-length deliveries from backward square leg and midwicket. </p> <p>\"It's nice to read a journalist admitting that we don't know know all the facts behind the KP stuff to form an opinion one way or the other,\" says Richard Gardham. \"However, we do know that an England captain (Stuart Broad) was following a Twitter account of one of his friends (which he joined some 90 minutes after it was started) that mocked in a quite personal way one of his team-mates. If England are going to be consistent over this 'dressing room harmony' line that we keep hearing, quite how has Stuart Broad got off scot free on that one by simply issuing a 'not me guv' statement? This tone of this message has nothing to do with the fact that my wife fancies Stuart Broad more than she fancies me, by the way.\"</p> <p>What would Fred Trueman make of all this? One thing about that parody account is that apparently KP retweeted some of the stuff as well. I don't know: are we really saying a player should be punished for having a joke at the expense one of his team-mates? You could argue it was spiteful (again, we don't know the facts so I wouldn't say that), but even then, this is a sport dressing room, not a shelter home for delicate souls. Whatever happened to Gary Cooper? The whole thing is a horrid mess.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 43-1 (Petersen 20, Amla 9)</strong> That's another lovely cover drive from Amla, skimmed for four when Anderson overpitches a fraction. Anderson gets his length just right two balls later and again goes past the outside edge. England could easily have had three wickets this morning.</p> <p>Here's Gary Naylor. Honk with him now. \"Yes KP this and yes KP that, but don't England need to keep bowling jaffas? Especially against batsmen who are particularly susceptible, having grown up in an Orange Free State.\" Honk!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 44-1 (Petersen 21, Amla 9)</strong> \"Okay, so we don't know all the facts re: KPGate, and we're never really likely too \u2013 which is okay, we can and will all make our own judgements,\" says David Horn. \"But I think that there is one thing we can all agree on here: Piers Morgan is a twonk. True, such a statement could stand on it's own any time before or after KPGate, but in these uncertain times it's handy to hold on to any absolute truths.\" He didn't write twonk, obviously. 'Ne'er-do-well' was the word he used I think.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 49-1 (Petersen 22, Amla 13)</strong> Anderson is too straight to Amla, and you know what that means: death by whirring wrists, with the ball pinged deliciously through square leg for four. Shaun Pollock reckons England are straining a touch too much for a wicket, with the result that we've had five boundaries in as many overs.</p> <p>\"Come on Rob,\" says Ryan Dunne, \"internet comments sections aren't that bad! Before they were invented, what would gentlemen who enjoy spending all day discussing supposed plot holes in Batman movies have done to fill the time? Talk to girls?!\" I'm going out on a limb here, but you've watched a lot of Seinfeld, haven't you?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 49-2 (Petersen c Prior b Finn 22)</strong> England get rid of Petersen. Honk. That joke doesn't really work does it, what with his name being spelt differently and all. Anyway, Alviro gloved a short one from Finn down the leg side, with Matt Prior taking a good diving catch. It looked routine, except replays suggested Petersen's hand might have been off the bat when he gloved it, just like Michael Kasprowicz at Edgbaston in 2005.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-3 (Amla b Finn 13)</strong> What a jaffa from Steven Finn! He has cleaned Amla up with a stunning delivery. It came back off the seam down the slope, roared through the gate and into the top of off stump. What a beauty or, as Bill Lawry would say, <em>BAAAAAAAHD 'IM</em>! Finn has two wickets in four balls and England have something in their nostrils.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 50-3 (Kallis 1, de Villiers 0)</strong> I suspect Petersen's hand was off the bat when he was dismissed, although it was desperately close. He stopped on his way off having seen the replay, although by then it was too late to review. I don't think the decision would have been overturned anyway as it was really tight.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 52-3 (Kallis 3, de Villiers 0)</strong> A few umbrellas are going up, which is more than a little frustrating because England are one wicket away from a very happy place. </p> <p>\"As the kind of England fan who roars with uncontained glee at every opposition wicket (including Smith's just now) and stays up listening to TMS on headphones all through the night when we are playing a dead rubber in New Zealand, it saddens me to find that I actually hope England are just pipped in this match with Jonny Bairstow making a golden pair,\" says David Sherwin. \"Like KP, I grew up in SA and when I started playing village cricket in England was astonished at the 'let's all just get along, including with the charming oppo' attitude. In time, I came to accept that maybe this had a place in the village leagues but cannot comprehend how this attitude appears to have inveigled itself into the England establishment. The job, surely, is to win at all costs, even if you are hating every last moment of it due to the company you are forced to keep. One of my colleagues is an horrendously unpleasant Scot, but by God is he good at his job so I admire rather castigate him; time for England to do the same re KP.\"</p> <p>The key distinction that has been made in the last few days is that you don't have to like your team-mates, but you do have to trust them. Whether that's what England feel, I don't know. What I would say is that there will always ve a line which, once crossed, means two people (or ten people and one person) cannot play together, so in that sense I don't see how anybody can criticise the England selectors. You might criticise them for their judgement of where that line is \u2013 except we can't do that because we don't know all the facts.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 54-4 (Kallis c Prior b Finn 3)</strong> Well well. England are risking their last review. Did Kallis glove Finn down the leg side? This is close. I think he'll get away with it. He appears to glove it, but his hand was almost certainly off the bat when he did so. The third umpire Rod Tucker is having a long look but he surely can't give this out. <strong>He's given him out</strong>! What the hell has happened there? South Africa have the face on. \"That is a poor decision,\" thunders Mikey Holding on Sky. The only thing I can think is that Rod Tucker thought it hit the left glove, which was on the bat handle, rather than the right. It didn't, and Kallis has every right to be royally radged off. <em>On</em> the plus side, England have taken four wickets before lunch. I told you they should have won the toss and batted.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 58-4 (de Villiers 1, Rudolph 5)</strong> That looks an appalling decision. If the on-field decision had been 'out' I'd still have reversed it, but to reverse a 'not-out' decision beggars belief. Some would say it's delayed payback for the Daryl Harper/Graeme Smith business in the fourth Test of 2009-10 I suppose, but it does look a stinker. It hit the glove \u2013 Hotspot now confirms that \u2013 but the glove was definitely off the bat handle when it did so. Snickometer confirms that was the case. There's a very small chance that both gloves were touching, with the left hand touching the bat as the ball hit the right hand. Would that count as a chain, like in, er, Shooting Fish, and thus be out? I'm not sure it would, and even so there's only a small chance that the gloves were touching. Kallis will feel like he's been strangled <em>and</em> sawn off.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 59-4 (de Villiers 1, Rudolph 5)</strong> Broad swings a full-length delivery onto the pads of Rudolph, bringing another big LBW shout. It was swinging down leg. Simon Taufel knew it. Andrew Strauss knew it. Stuart Broad probably didn't. A maiden. \"Saffers, meet Karma; Karma, meet Saffers,\" says Daniel Harris. \"This is what you get...\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 63-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 5)</strong> Ah, well. Nasser Hussain tells us that the gloves do count as a chain, so you <em>can</em> be given out that away. However, it seems the gloves almost certainly weren't touching. Either Rod Tucker is a genius from the future, who sees things we can't see, or he's had a shocker.</p> <p>\"Speaking of Kasprowicz in 2005, can you imagine the situation if reviews had been in place then,\" says Jamie Jermain. \"Australia would have reviewed the decision on the off chance he didn't glove it, the third umpire would have picked up that his hand was off the bat and Australia would have clipped the winning runs to mid wicket. Cue no wild celebrations, no Freddie and Lee and a horrible anti-climax.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 65-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 7)</strong> The final ball of the session is a snorter from Stuart Broad that swings through Rudolph's gate and bounces just over the stumps. The rain is getting heavier as the players wander off. What a morning it's been for England. Andrew Strauss said it wasn't a bad toss to lose, and Steven Finn backed him up with three wickets in seven balls on his home ground. The third was a gift \u2013 Jacques Kallis was never out \u2013 but England won't have too much sympathy. They are in a fantastic position and, better still, everyone is talking about events on the field.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>1.07pm</strong> It's pouring down.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>1.08pm</strong> \"Rob,\" says Oliver Smiddy. \"You said: 'Are we really saying a player should be punished for having a joke at the expense one of his team-mates?' Isn't that exactly what the ECB have done with KP? Wasn't he having a joke at the expense of a team-mate with his friends? And more to the point, doing so entirely privately, whereas Broad and co were doing so IN PUBLIC. I don't mind the ECB asking for an apology etc but there needs to be consistency.\"</p> <p>Surely it's impossible to have a notion of consistency when there are degrees of abuse/humour/banter/whatever. I thought KP was supposed to have used a derogatory word. More to the point, this is about a lot more than those text messages. England clearly decided that enough was enough ahead of such an important Test match. Without knowing all the facts, I don't see how we can criticise them for that.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>1.26pm</strong> \"And with that Rod Tucker 'dismissal' this Test has become a sham,\" says Luke Smith. \"Kallis is our '50/3 in a stitch and need a gutsy 100' go to man. At 50/3 with him in, we were always still in with a fight. Now? Well, if we make 200 I'll be surprised. Disgusting umpiring that will undoubtedly affect the match and series. Also defending it as karma is probably the sorest excuse yet. Graeme Smith's 'dismissal' at Headingley wasn't enough was it?\"</p> <p>It was a shocker, and can't be defended, but I'm not sure it makes the Test a sham or will overshadow the result if England do win. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/15/graeme-smith-sabc-third-umpire\">Remember this</a>?

I think Vic Marks' piece went in a similar direction, which is perhaps why it became a haven for the people who think KP has been getting the rough end of all this. My question to you though is, do you think the press coverage has been fair? An awful lot of those comments were criticising the cricket media for uncritically towing the ECB line, and often not asking sufficiently searching questions. I tend to agree with this point of view, and I wonder if more people would be perched atop your fence were they reading more balanced reporting...\"</p> <p>Hmm, I think the reporting has been excellent. The proper journalists know the background to the story, and a lot more about what has happened over the past week, even if they can't necessarily publish all of that, so their judgement comes from a position of greater authority than ours. Except that ne'er-do-well Booth, obviously, who is no better than Stanford.</p> <p>Anyway, shall we call it a draw and ban KP talk for the rest of the day? Let's do that. It's getting a bit boring, and more to the point it's overshadowing what is shaping up to be a wonderful Test match.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 65-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 7)</strong> The justified fuss over Kallis's dismissal has diverted attention from the fact that England are in a sensational position, only two wickets away from a longish tail. Steven Finn starts after lunch and beats AB de Villiers second ball with a very full delivery that zips past the edge. I think de Villiers lost sight of it, and if it had been straight he'd have been in big trouble. He's really struggling and loses sight of a short ball later in the over that hits the face of a horizontal bat and lands safely on the off side. That could have gone anywhere. They don't like it up 'em!</p> <p>\"It's all a bit quiet at Lord's isn't it? I'd forgotten sport could be like this. don't we need a blast of muse to get the juices flowing? Boom! Boom! Boom!\" That's Emma John, the Guardian Olympic Vet who may or may be suffering from PostEuphoric Stress Disorder.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 66-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 8)</strong> A quiet over from Broad, who is swinging it a little but only at around 80mph. At the moment Broad is almost filler while we wait for another Finn over. </p> <p>\"I'm pleased that South Africa are in this situation,\" says Mark Hughes. \"They would certainly make a worthy No1, but the accolade demands that they should demonstrate steel and determination when under pressure. The three-match series threatened to let them leave these shores without ever having been under the cosh. Let's see what they're made of.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 71-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 9)</strong> The sun has gone back in at Lord's, although the chaps on Sky reckon the forecast is decent. Finn has Rudolph on strike when he would probably prefer another crack at de Villiers. A single off the fifth ball allows him a solitary delivery at de Villiers: shortish, wide and slapped crisply to the cover boundary.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 72-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 10)</strong> Rudolph can't decide what to do with a short ball from Broad, eventually wearing it on the arm. That prompts England to bring in Taylor at short leg. I'd be tempted to get Swann on ahead of schedule against Rudolph, who was dismissed twice in three balls by Him at Headingley.</p> <p>\"This morning, I caught a little of England's match in the Under-19s World Cup,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Ben Duckett looked a lot like Eoin Morgan at the crease with invention to spare and an eye like a dead fish. Nepal's fielding was excellent, but some naive bowling left their batsmen with an er... mountain to climb and England ran out easy winners. Quarter-Final on Sunday vs The Saffers \u2013 should be fun!\" It'll be lovely to see the future England Test players on both sides.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 79-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 13)</strong> Finn swings one down the leg side for four byes before Rudolph welts him through the covers for three. In other news, want to look at some pictures? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/16/andrew-strauss-100-england-test-in-pictures\">Here's a nice gallery of Straussy's 100 Tests</a>.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 79-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 13)</strong> As Broad gets through another maiden, the camera cuts to Alice Cooper in the crowd. Alice Cooper at the cricket! That's magnificent. \"He looks a bit lived-in...\" says Bumble on Sky. He must be one of the more unlikely figures to appear at a Test match. Who would be top of the list? <a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/onthisday/sport/story/358.html\">Eisenhower would be up there</a>.</p> <p>\"'Two wickets away from a longish tail'?\" sniffs SB Tang. \"I dunno about that one \u2014 you might be tempting fate! Philander's got two first-class tons and a first-class batting average of 24.87. And Steyn, with his solid technique and temperament, can be a real Gillespie-like, crease-occupying pest down the order.\" Hence longish rather than long. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63844.html\">This is a long tail</a>. I wouldn't underestimate either of them, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/content/story/384431.html\">and we all remember Steyn's 76</a>, but I still think Philander is a Test No9 and Steyn a Test No10.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 87-4 (de Villiers 17, Rudolph 13)</strong> A glorious shot from de Villiers, who times a half-volley from Finn through midwicket for four. Two balls later he flaps a short ball through square leg for another boundary. I don't think he saw that properly either. Thanks, incidentally, for all the emails explaining what 'doos' (box) actually means. I've amended the earlier reference.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 87-4 (de Villiers 17, Rudolph 13)</strong> This is a good move, with Graeme Swann replacing Stuart Broad. He's armed with a haircut, a history of getting wickets in his first over and the knowledge that Rudolph fell twice in three balls to off spin at Headingley. He survives the a full over here, if not entirely comfortably. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 97-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 13)</strong> A low full toss from Finn is eased through the covers for four more by de Villiers. That's the seventh boundary he has conceded today and the third in five balls. Make that four in nine balls, a whirling pull round the corner off a very poor delivery. It's been a mixed bag from Finn (12-2-48-3) and it's probably Jimmytime at that end.</p> <p>\"Most unlikely figure to appear at a Test?\" says Ben Powell. \"KP! Honk!\" I'm going to allow it.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 99-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 15)</strong> Swann loves having a tentative left-hander to work with, and he is mixing up his pace and flight. Rudolph works a couple to leg and defends the rest.</p> <p>\"For fans of the old glam rocker, I've just heard that Alice Cooper is going to be on TMS at tea,\" says Clare Davies. \"I always thought golf was his thing, but obviously cricket ranks too.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 99-4 (De Villiers not out 27)</strong> De Villiers survives a huge shout from LBW by Anderson and England again decide to review the decision. This is extremely close. Did he get outside the line? That's the only thing that can save him I reckon. There's a mark on Hotspot but I suspect that's bat on pad. He played defensively down the wrong line at a good delivery that ducked back in. They are still looking at Hotspot over a possible inside edge, but I'd wager all my nostril hair on that being bat on pad rather than ball. This is even before we see whether it was hitting the stumps. It's all irrelevant because de Villiers has survived. The ball was hitting the stumps but the point of impact was 'umpire's call' and Rod Tucker, controversially, presses the correct button. That was ridiculously close. Approximately 49 per cent of the ball hit the pad in line with the stumps and 51 per cent outside the line. So the on-field decision stands \u2013 as it would have done had Kumar Dharmasena given it out \u2013 and England are out of reviews.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 99-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 15)</strong> <br>\"I was fairly surprised,\" begins Paul Stephens, \"to see Billy Corgan at a Test match in Wellington, New Zealand.\" You've been eating some very special cheese. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHtq7rP4se0\">Hang on, it really, really, really did happen</a>.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> Excellent stuff from Rudolph, who chips Swann confidently over midwicket for four.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> A maiden from Anderson to de Villiers. South Africa could have sulked after that Kallis decision and given this away \u2013 and a few good South African teams of the past 20 years might have done so \u2013&#xa0;but these two have played with impressive calmness and determination since lunch. The conclusion you would draw from this series is that nothing comes easily against this lot, which makes some of their collapses in the past year or two particularly hard to fathom.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> Rudolph has faced every delivery from Swann so far and defends another maiden.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 105-5 (de Villiers c Cook b Anderson 27)</strong> Gone! De Villiers, having survived that Spandex-tight review on 27, falls without adding to his score. That's a huge breakthrough for England. Anderson lured him into an expansive drive with a very full delivery that nipped away just enough to take the edge, and Cook at third slip moved smartly to his left to take a sharp two-handed catch.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 105-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 0)</strong> Crikey, what a position are England are in now. Duminy survives a biggish LBW shout third ball. There have no reviews left but it was going over anyway. Anderson, the pick of the attack by a distance, has figures of 12-4-24-2.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 105-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 0)</strong> Now Swann has two left-handers to work with, and from memory he has given Duminy problems in the past. For now it's Rudolph, and it's another maiden, the fourth in a row.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 107-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 2)</strong> There's a bit of excitement when Duminy appears to inside edge Anderson onto the pad and just short of gully, but in fact the ball hit both pads. \"Alice Cooper's management got in touch and asked if we wanted to do anything with him,\" writes Paul King of Sky. \"But they admitted he didn't know much about cricket so I declined. Baseball and golf are his thing I gather, but he likes sport generally.\" Insert your own 'you need a knowledge of cricket to appear?' joke here.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 113-5 (Rudolph 27, Duminy 2)</strong> From here, England will hope to dismiss South Africa for under 200. South Africa? They will try to sneak up to around 300 and then tell Dale Steyn that the entire England team called him a doos. This partnership is vital. Obviously. Rudolph cuts Swann confidently for four. He has faced every one of Swann's 36 deliveries today, and he's played him almost as well as Livia Soprano played Uncle June at the end of season one.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 118-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 3)</strong> Duminy drives Anderson wide of mid off, where Broad saves three runs with an excellent diving stop. England have been sharp in the field. It's almost as if they want to make a point. No fielder can do anything later in the over when Rudolph clouts a very wide, very full delivery over cover for four. The next ball swings past Rudolph's loose drive. \"That's rubbish from the batsman,\" says David Gower on Sky.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 119-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 4)</strong> Swann gets his first bowl at Duminy, who comes down the track to drive the fourth ball pleasantly for a single. \"What's a good score on this wicket?\" says Jonathan Sexton. \"I'm always a bit reluctant to get too giddy before both sides have had a bat.\" No idea. Around 350-400 maybe, although as always a lot depends on the overhead conditions. It could easily turn into a 230 plays 260 dogfight.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 123-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 8)</strong> Duminy pushes Anderson classily down the ground for four. Although he is yet to fulfil <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44932.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">his early promise in Tests</a>, he is a helluva talent to have coming in at No7. And Graham Onions is a helluva talent to have on the bench. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542534.html\">Look what he's up to today</a>.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 123-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 8)</strong> The first jaffa of Swann's spell spits sharply past Rudolph's defensive push. Another maiden. This is such a crucial little spell before tea. If England get one more that ice-cool Gatorade will taste real good.</p> <p>\"Am I the only one who feels like this series is just starting to warm up?\" says Mike Jakeman. \"Ignoring the growing tedium around KP, England seem to be at the races for the first time this summer. The next two matches are going to be huge. There's nothing like the slowly unfolding narrative of a five-Test icon series. I can't wait.\" Yep. We've said it before, but whoever did this should be mirror-averse for a long time.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 127-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 12)</strong> Duminy again drives Anderson through mid off for four. \"Re: the 45th over,\" says Ian Stubbins. \"C Mustard B Onions. Is there any more delicious way to lose your wicket?\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 131-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 12)</strong> <br>Rudolph continues to take Swann. It might be coincidence or he might be protecting Duminy. Either way, he blazes an emphatic drive over mid off for four. Fetch that! Rudolph has face 43 of Swann's 48 deliveries thus far.</p> <p>\"Makes me chuckle to think of each English cricket fan turning to their Saffer friend to call him a 'doos',\" says Richard Spry, \"when the correct pronunciation is, of course, 'doos' ...\" No wonder Graeme Swann isn't developing a doosra. In this age of faux outrage he'd probably be hounded out of the team.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 136-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 17)</strong> Broad comes on for Anderson (16-4-39-2). His third ball is a miserable piece of filth \u2013 short, wide, 80mph and belaboured through the off side for four by Duminy. His pace is a long way down today, in the low 80s. Either that or the speedgun is knacked. An early speedgun, for the 1996 Lord's Test, reckoned Mark Ealham was faster than Wasim Akram. And a bloody good speedgun it was.</p> <p>\"Cook c Mustard b Onions,\" says Alex Marsh. \"Nothing particularly witty, I'm a lazy man. Just some more cricketing combos that <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/577060.html\">Cricinfo came up with but three days ago</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 141-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 22)</strong> These two are almost in block/thwack mode against Swann, and Duminy pumps him down the ground for four more during an otherwise quiet over. This is turning into a useful partnership. \"Looking at that link you posted of the scorecard where Graham Onions is running rampant, it looks like Durham are playing with 12 men?!\" says Kat Rowles. \"They are all out, but with Onions down as 'did not bat'. How does that work then...? Or am I having a blonde afternoon and have missing something \u2013 entirely possible, I'm running on only one coffee today...\" Yeah tey changed the rules a few years ago so that a 12th man from a Test could replace a player during a county match. I think James Kirtley was the first, but I can't find the relevant link. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/131515.html\">Ah, here we go</a>.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>51st over: South Africa 141-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 22)</strong> Broad bowls a maiden to Duminy. Is that tea? Apparently not; presumably they've put it back to 3.55pm or 4.10pm.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>52nd over: South Africa 148-5 (Rudolph 40, Duminy 24)</strong> Trott replaces Swann, a pretty surprising move but one that almost produces a wicket. Rudolph and Duminy got in a mix up over a possible leg bye, and Rudolph was three-fifths of the way down the track by the time he was sent back. The throw to the bowler's end was poor, however, and Rudolph was able to get back.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>53rd over: South Africa 150-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 25)</strong> Duminy takes his eye off a short ball from Broad that hits him on the back of the arm. Given his perceived weakness against the short ball it's slightly surprising that Finn hasn't had a spell at him, although I'm sure he will after tea.</p> <p>\"I think that Ian Austin was the first player to be substituted during a county match in 1998,\" says Graeme Thorn. \"<a href=\" http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/66/66337.html\">The scorecard here</a> says that RJ Green substituted for Austin when he was called up to play in the ODIs.\"</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>54th over: South Africa 151-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 26)</strong> Trott. Duminy. One run.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>55th over: South Africa 151-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 26)</strong> Swann switches ends to bowl the last over before tea. Nothing happens. It's been South Africa's session, with 86 runs scored for the loss of AB de Villiers, although England are still in an excellent position. James Riach has just been presented with a keyboard by Lawrence Booth and will make his OBO debut after tea. You can email him at <a href=\"mailto:james.riach.casual@theguardian.com\">james.riach.casual@theguardian.com</a>. See you tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p>4.06pm: Afternoon folks. Been a good day for England so far, although Duminy and Rudolph were beginning to look pretty settled out there before tea. Let's see how the evening unfolds...</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p>4.11pm: Yohan Blake has been chewing the fat with Michael Holding and Ian Ward. \"I'm a better cricketer than a runner,\" he claims. Don't know about that, but I certainly wouldn't want to be at the other end with the Beast steaming in, that's for sure.</p> <p>He also thinks Twenty20 cricket should be part of the Olympics. Thoughts everyone?</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p>4.15pm: Players are out for the evening session...</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>56th over: South Africa 153-5 (Rudolph 42, Duminy 27)</strong> Trott continues after tea, don't know if he'll stick there or England want to swap Finn to the Nursery End. Either way it's a pretty tight over from him, just the two off it. Blake in the Sky commentary box, says he can bowl around 89-90mph. I reckon this young maverick is pulling our leg a wee bit.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>57th over: South Africa 163-5 (Rudolph 42, Duminy 33)</strong> It is Finn who takes the reins now and he beats Duminy's outside edge with a beaut. Next delivery is too full though and is driven through the covers for four. Lovely shot from Duminy, who picks up another couple on the off side. Four leg byes from the last ball, an expensive over.</p> <p>Guy Hornsby says: \"Listening to Alice Cooper on TMS is wonderfully surreal. I could listen to him chat all day, he's such a softly-spoken gent for his stage reputation. And having him at Lord's, chatting to Aggers about snakes, having brought a cake in to TMS, I never thought I'd see the day. I can imagine some of the MCC chaps choking into their pink gins. Sir Geoffrey made himself scarce, possibly so someone couldn't take a photo and tweet it. I'd have paid good money to see that. \"</p> <p>Think Geoffrey was probably perturbed by the whole thing.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>WICKET! (Rudolph, b Swann 42)</strong></p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p>Rudolph won't be happy with that, straight through the gate from Swann, who replaces Trott and has an immediate impact. Bit of a half-tracker that came off the inside edge, onto the pad before clattering the stumps. Vernon Philander next up...</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>58th over: South Africa 164-6 (Duminy 33, Philander 1)</strong> Great over from Swann, England nearing the tail now.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>59th over: South Africa 172-6 (Duminy 33, Philander 9)</strong> Finn with a bit of late movement and catches Philander's outside edge, but that runs for four with no third man. Dead ball next up as Finn accidentally knocks off the bails with his leg when releasing. Lovely cover drive from Philander takes him quickly to nine, again Finn going too long. To compensate he bangs in a short one.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>60th over: South Africa 177-6 (Duminy 34, Philander 13)</strong></p> <p>Swann gets punished with the last ball of the over as Philander smashes one to the leg-side boundary. Something for the South Africans to cheer about. </p> <p>On the Olympics debate...</p> <p>Alex Walker: \"There's enough micky mouse sports already there and it wouldn't be the pinnacle of the game. Football, tennis and golf in Brazil, should all be taken out. The Olympics is for sports that don't have a bigger stage. There's a reason Murray won the semis and final in straight sets.\"</p> <p>John Starbuck: \"They began talking about T20 as an Olympic sport a couple of years ago, when it became clear it really worked as a short-form competition, but it will have to wait awhile as all the new sports are already sorted for Rio and anyway you have to replace another sport, like kitesurfing for windsurfing. Mind you, one of the new ones is golf, so obviously the bar is set pretty low.\"</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>61st over: South Africa 178-6 (Duminy 34, Philander 13)</strong></p> <p>Finn with a better over, just the one off it as Duminy pats a short one down on the leg side.</p> <p>Phil Sawyer says: \"Afternoon James, welcome to the seat of power. Use it, don't abuse it. Mind you, the last time someone said that to Smyth \u2026, well, questions were asked in Parliament and Gary Naylor was left with a permanent twitch. Anyway, I digress. What time can today's play go on until, bearing in mind the short rain delay? Just trying to work out whether it's worth legging it home from work to catch an hour or so's play.\"</p> <p>Think close will be between 6.30pm and 7pm tonight. I do feel incredibly powerful right now, it has to be said. This is the pinnacle.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>62nd over: South Africa 180-6 (Duminy 37, Philander 13)</strong> A couple off the over from Swann. Far more interesting, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cricketanalyst/status/236123567639633920/photo/1\">this picture on Twitter courtesy of Simon Hughes</a>.</p> <p>I challenge you not to laugh at that. <strong>Caption competition... what is Geoffrey thinking?<br></strong></p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>63rd over: South Africa 183-6 (Duminy 38, Philander 15)</strong> Chance for a catch at deep square leg as Philander doesn't catch his pull quite right...but it falls short of Bell. Finn looks on with disappointment, but there was no way that was ever going to reach. He's getting some really fierce bounce out there and it's causing problems. Wonder if Bairstow is looking on with concern.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>64th over: South Africa 188-6 (Duminy 39, Philander 18)</strong> Change of bowling and it's Anderson who takes over from Swann, a good move in my opinion. A few loose ones to begin with that are dispatched for singles, but there's still plenty of swing for Jimmy to play with, moving it away well from the right-hander Philander. That rolled off the tongue very nicely. Ooh. Hard hands from Philander and he edges one to second slip...but it falls short of Swann.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>65th over: South Africa 191-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 21)</strong> Tight over from Swann but England will be keen to not let these two settle down...</p> <p>Tom Bonsel says: \"James, see if you can't use your new found power to depose the Rob Smyth. Perhaps send a few scurrilous rumours bouncing round the press-box that Rob has been sending derogatory text messages to other Gruanaid staffers......\"</p> <p>I know for a fact that he called John Ashdown a box behind his back this morning.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>66th over: South Africa 192-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 22)</strong> That's an absolute jaffa from Anderson to Philander, cutting away off the seam and beating the bat by a country mile. Although he's walking a bit gingerly at the moment, stretching and rolling his ankle. Looks like he'll be OK to soldier on and his next delivery shows no signs that he is suffering from too much pain.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>67th over: South Africa 193-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 23)</strong> Great fielding at mid-wicket from the captain, diving to his left well. A single next up from Philander though who pads one past Ian Bell at short leg. Oh that's a snorter from Swann! He drifts one in to Duminy but it turns viciously off the pitch, beating the bat and finding Prior's gloves. Duminy tries to then cut one away but doesn't get it off the middle.</p> <p>Caption competition, for this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cricketanalyst/status/236123567639633920/photo/1\">wonderful photo</a>.</p> <p>Gary Naylor: \"Bah gum!

Not a serious appeal.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>69th over: South Africa 198-6 (Duminy 42, Philander 25)</strong> Three from the over, with Swann keeping it relatively tight. 11 overs until the new ball so Anderson is going to have a little rest and Broad will be up next.</p> <p>\"Eeeee, there's nowt s' queer as folk\" is Jonathan Sexton's caption attempt...</p> <p>\"Sir Geoffrey's cheeky grin is leading me to try and think up some kind of pun involving \"corridor of uncertainty\" but at present I'm drawing a blank.\"</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>70th over: South Africa 201-6 (Duminy 44, Philander 26)</strong> Broad charges in and his first ball is slightly over-pitched, Duminy drives and thinks he's beaten Trott in the field, a mistake, and he has to quicken his running to make ground, making it relatively comfortably in the end though. Broad then counters with a shorter effort which Philander edges and balloons up in the air, but it falls safe. That was a let off but the 200 comes up for South Africa and there is a ripple of applause around Lord's.</p> <p><strong>DRINKS ARE SERVED</strong></p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>71st over: South Africa 205-6 (Duminy 47, Philander 27)</strong> Nicely played from Duminy off Swann, tickled through the off side for two. This is a good battle between the right-arm spinner and the left-hand batsman, who flicks one off his legs to give Philander the strike. He drops onto the back foot and plays the ball to the covers for a single. Swann ends the over with a full toss but Duminy can't score.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>72nd over: South Africa 217-6 (Duminy 50, Philander 36)</strong> Philander slices one off Broad and that beats the man at point and runs away to the boundary for four. That wasn't textbook by any stretch of the imagination but effective nonetheless. Broad then sends a short one down but Duminy plays it beautifully, guiding it down to third man to bring up his 50 and the 50 partnership. Philander smacks one down the ground to the long-off boundary for four. Oh dear Stuart.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>73rd over: South Africa 218-6 (Duminy 51, Philander 36)</strong> This partnership is beginning to get a bit worrying for England but the new ball is available in seven overs \u2013 that will be the key. One off that over from Swann.</p> <p>James Dale: \"Graham Onions has all 8 Notts wickets up at Trent Bridge and is on for the first 10fer in first class cricket since....?\"</p> <p>Great performance from Onions it has to be said, driving back up to Nottingham this morning after not being selected for this game. <strong>He has in fact taken nine wickets and the other one was a run-out!

Duminy and Philander are moving their feet well and striding down the pitch to Swann at every opportunity. 60 off 105 balls for these two but here comes Mr Trott for another short burst. He had three overs earlier \u2013 can the part-timer catch South Africa off guard?</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>76th over: South Africa 225-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> Goodness me Trott beats Philander all ends up, but he also beats Prior as well! His first delivery nips back through the gate but England's wicketkeeper completely misses it and that's two byes. That was precisely 1.3cm away from the off stump according to Hawkeye, mightily close. No runs scored by either batsman.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>77th over: South Africa 225-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> It's a first maiden in a while for England, Swann not giving away anything there and Duminy can't score. </p> <p>Alex Wright: \"In response to James Dale, was the last 10fer Otis Gibson, of Durham at the time, against Hampshire a few years back? I recall it because whilst he was ripping through th opposition batting order his sometime former team mates in the West Indies side were toiling badly against a rampant england batting line up.\"</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>78th over: South Africa 227-6 (Duminy 55, Philander 39)</strong> Trott with another over of his dibbler-dobblers that are making the South African's think just a tad. There's certainly a little bit of gentle swing in the middle there and he's keeping a good line to Duminy. More confusion between the wickets between the batsmen, though, and there's a shy at the stumps ... but Philander had comfortably made his ground.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>79th over: South Africa 233-6 (Duminy 60, Philander 40)</strong> Lovely, delicate shot from Duminy that adds four onto his score, tickling Swann down to fine leg with a deft touch. He seems to have won the little tussle that the two were having. Philander, meanwhile, is batting sensibly, picking up ones and twos without doing anything extravagant.</p> <p>Caption from Philip Keegan: \"My mother could bite the head off a chicken with a stick of rhubarb.\"</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>80th over: South Africa 235-6 (Duminy 61, Philander 41)</strong> Trott beats Philander's outside edge with a corker. Still England can't break this partnership, though. Jimmy Anderson is warming up and set to start a new spell.</p> <p><strong>THE NEW BALL IS TAKEN</strong></p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>WICKET! (Duminy, b Anderson c Prior, 61)</strong></p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>81st over: South Africa 235-7 (Philander 41, Steyn 0)</strong> Duminy will be furious with himself for that. Anderson strikes from the Pavilion End and the new ball does its job. A really poor shot which he top edges to Prior, and to be honest, it wasn't a great delivery - indeed, it was the widest Anderson has balled to Duminy all innings. Who cares about line and length ey? </p> <p>Dale Steyn next up for South Africa, and England have been given a lift with that. I don't think many people expected Philander to stick around for so long when he walked to the crease, but fair play to the lad, he's looked composed and accomplished throughout his innings. Broad has the next over...</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>82nd over: South Africa 236-7 (Philander 42, Steyn 0)</strong> Broad with a vicious away swinger to Philander that is met with an air shot and gasps from the Lord's cognoscenti. The next ball is clipped away for a single so Steyn has the honour of facing with one remaining from the over. Here comes Broad... but Steyn just blocks away.</p> <p>John Tumbridge on Twenty20 in the Olympics: \"I would be worried about some of the more insignificant islands; Australia for example, being able to find a decent team of eleven.\"</p> <p>Meow John</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>83rd over: South Africa 243-7 (Philander 43, Steyn 6)</strong> Fine bowling from Anderson and he beat's Philander's outside edge with a darting away swinger. Next up is a single but Philander's right boot comes off as he sets off! Don't think I have ever seen that before.</p> <p>Steyn now facing and he gets a leading edge...which runs down to third man for four, but he had no idea about it. Anderson looking frustrated and his next delivery is shorter, chipped into the air ... but safe. Seven from the over but not what it deserved.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>84th over: South Africa 250-7 (Philander 44, Steyn 12)</strong> Broad clatters Steyn on the pad but he had planted his front foot forward and that looked like it was high, no real appeal from England. Steyn gets a thick edge through the off side for a couple, but is completely bamboozled immediately afterwards, driving and missing. Broad then changes the line but in attempt to go right at the stumps he pushes it just outside leg and Steyn runs it down to fine leg for four. Oh blow.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>85th over: South Africa 251-7 (Philander 45, Steyn 12)</strong> Short one from Anderson that climbs up on Steyn, but he defends it well on his toes. It is surely only a matter of time before he nicks one behind at this rate, though Anderson is persisting with pitching it short. \"Ragged,\" according to Michael Holding. To be fair to Anderson, this is his 22nd over over the day. Last ball now and Steyn gets a thick edge, but it bounces well short of gully.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>86th over: South Africa 255-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 15)</strong> Average speed from Broad today has been 80.3mph, a bit slower than earlier in the summer. \"Certainly not as quick as Yohan Blake,\" jokes Atherton. HA HA HA.</p> <p>Steyn clips him off his legs with consummate ease but only single as there is a man out in the deep. The sting seems to have gone out of England's attack despite that wicket not long ago.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>87th over: South Africa 259-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 19)</strong> It's looking a bit overcast and dark at Lord's and one of the floodlights has decided to pack up, hopefully that can be fixed sharpish and we'll get some prolonged play this evening. Twice in two overs Steyn sticks his arm up as some plonker in the members area gets up to put his jacket on just as Anderson reaches the crease. He's sent back and starts his run-up once again but Steyn knocks a four through the leg side. That will have infuriated Anderson and, sure enough, next up is a beauty that beats the bat. Another jaffa follows and that's too good for Steyn \u2013 so much so that he's nowhere near the ball. Last of the over and it's edged ... but short of Cook at third slip.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>88th over: South Africa 262-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 21)</strong> Finn is back in the saddle and steaming in with renewed vigour. Steyn is struggling to see out there and he gets one in the ribs, this could be the end of action for the day as he is having a conflab with the umpires. He doesn't look happy with the light ... and sure enough the umpires lead the players off for stumps with 87.4 overs having been bowled.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p>6.29pm: So that's close of play at Lord's after a first day that England will certainly be happy with. They haven't bowled brilliantly but Anderson was the pick of the bunch, he ends with figures of 3-58 off 23.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p>6.33pm: Phil Sawyer says: \"Apparently there's been a massive power cut. TMS are now doing an emergency broadcast from what sounds like an engineering cupboard, without any access to a scoreboard to tell them what's going on. It's strangely compelling.\"</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p>6.35pm: Credit to Duminy for a well-played 61 and somehow Dale Steyn managed a quick 21 off 32 balls as the light faded. Vernon Philander is still there on 46 \u2013 he's the man England will target early tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p>6.39pm: That's it from me then folks, messrs Smyth and Bagchi will cast their expert eyes over proceedings tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>A man has been charged with assault with intent to kill after a security guard was shot at the Washington DC offices of the Family Research Council.</p> <p>Floyd Lee Corkins II, from Herndon, Virginia, was due to appear in the US district court in DC on Thursday afternoon. Corkins has also been charged with interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition.</p> <p>Security guard Leonardo Reno Johnson was shot in the arm in the lobby of the conservative group's headquarters after challenging Corkins, the FBI said. Corkins, who authorities said was carrying 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches, told the guard: \"I don't like your politics\" before firing.</p> <p>The FBI affidavit released on Thursday said that Corkins was subdued by the injured Johnson after the shooting. Corkins was carrying a legally owned 9mm Sig Sauer handgun, with a backpack containing 50 additional rounds of ammunition and the 15 sandwiches.</p> <p>Corkins, 28, lived with his parents and had recently been volunteering at an LGBT center in DC. His parents told FBI agents that he has \"strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner\", according to the affidavit.</p> <p>The Family Research Council opposes gay marriage, and its president, Tom Perkins, attracted some criticism last month after emailing members suggesting they should support Chick-fil-A's stance on gay rights.</p> <p>The affidavit said Corkins had parked his Dodge Neon at the East Falls Church metro station in Virginia, catching a train with his gun to DC. The assault charge carries up to 30 years in prison and the weapons charge has a 10-year maximum sentence.</p> <p>Johnson, 46, was shot in the left arm and taken to hospital, where his mother, 72-year-old Virginia Johnson, said he was resting comfortably on Thursday morning. She said she had not been to visit him but had spoken to him by phone.</p> <p>\"He said he feels very well,\" she told Associated Press. \"I am proud of him, very proud of him.\"</p> <p>FRC president Tony Perkins said he visited Johnson, who had worked at the Family Research Council for over 11 years, in hospital and told him that he was a hero. \"He said: 'This hero business is hard work,'\" Perkins said on American Family Radio.</p> <p>Perkins added that the shooting would not deter his organization from its mission. \"We're not going anywhere. We're not backing up, we're not shutting up. We have been called to speak the truth,\" Perkins said. \"We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced.\"</p> <p>More than 20 different LGBT organisations from across the US put out a statement condemning the shooting. \"We were saddened to hear news of the shooting this morning at the offices of the Family Research Council. Our hearts go out to the shooting victim, his family and his co-workers,\" it said.</p> <p>\"The motivation and circumstances behind today's tragedy are still unknown, but regardless of what emerges as the reason for this shooting, we utterly reject and condemn such violence. We wish for a swift and complete recovery for the victim of this terrible incident.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Anton Vickerman, the Briton sentenced this week to four years in jail for running a website that linked to pirated US TV and film content, has launched an 18,000 word attack on the anti-piracy organisation that ran a private prosecution against him.</p> <p>The 38-year-old from Gateshead complained about the evidence-gathering methods of the Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact). Film-industry financed Fact filmed inside his home \u2013 with one of its agents posing as a prospective house buyer \u2013 and obtained evidence at a meeting where another Fact operative posed undercover as an investor in his website.</p> <p>Vickerman, wrote: \"By the time you read this I will be starting my new life behind bars.\" He claimed that Fact initially wrongly complained to police that he was criminally distributing DVDs from his home, and encouraged a police officer working at the body on secondment to try to get the police to tap his phone and internet connections.</p> <p>On Wednesday Vickerman, who owned and ran the Surfthechannel website, was found guilty at Newcastle crown court of two counts of conspiracy to defraud. He had been successfully prosecuted by Fact after Surfthechannel was found to be carrying links to sites the organisation said infringed copyright on films, including newly released blockbusters.</p> <p>Angry at the outcome of events, and the conduct of the eight week jury trial that led to him being found guilty, Vickerman said in his farewell blog: \"If you were looking for an example of British justice in all its shining glory then you weren't going to find it here.\"</p> <p>Surfthechannel was set up by Vickerman in 2007 and his \"video search engine\" rapidly became a prime destination online, growing from 40,000 links in April 2008 to more than 2m in August 2009, and was just outside the 500 most visited sites online, according to evidence presented at the trial.</p> <p>Vickerman, who located the website in Sweden and received payments for adverts on the site through bank accounts in Latvia, said Surfthechannel \"did not, nor has it ever\" streamed content itself.</p> <p>In the site's early days, Vickerman said, he formed partnerships with the likes of Warner Bros, Discovery Channel, A&amp;E Television Networks \"and many other bona fide companies, as they realised how important [Surfthechannel] was becoming in the video on demand market. Surfthechannel quickly became one of the leading video search engines in the world, second only to Google Video.\"</p> <p>Fact's prosecution of Vickerman was principally over links to sites hosting films and especially movies which had not been released on DVD or pay TV \u2013 and in some cases had not had theatrical release.</p> <p>Vickerman claims that the original search warrant used to seize computers at his house in August 2008 was issued after Fact wrongly claimed to Northumbria police that that he and his wife were illegally distributing DVDs from his home. The computers seized in that search led to the prosecution and conviction of Vickerman, although he declined to yield the password for his encrypted content \u2014 a fact about which the judge was highly critical in his sentencing remarks.</p> <p>He also makes a number of complaints about the collection by FACT's data forensics experts from his home computer. He also says the \"chain of evidence\" of data collection from his computer to the evidence presented in court was not complete. The Crown Prosecution Service decided in December 2008 not to prosecute Vickerman, but Fact then pursued a private prosecution, and retained an image of his computer.</p> <p>He says that internal Fact emails revelaed in evidence indicate that the private enforcement body had intended, after seizing his computer, to replace the Surfthechannel front page with a message saying \"This website is under investigation by FACT\" \u2014 which, he says, \"would have immediately have killed the STC website before it (and I) had a chance to properly defend it in a court of law\", and which he calls \"a prime example of FACT Ltd acting as judge, jury and executioner.\" However Fact's lawyer said at the trial that as no such action was carried out, the claim is immaterial.</p> <p>The now jailed man also complains that Judge John Evans, who heard the case, \"went from hostile to incredible hostile to myself and my defence team\" after a Public Interest Immunity (PII) hearing in December \u2014 one where Fact presented a witness whose identity was kept secret from the defence and the court in a secret hearing. \"It became clear to me even at this stage that I was not going to receive a fair trial in front of HHJ [His Honour Justice] Evans,\" he writes.</p> <p>Fact declined to comment on Vickerman's claims. \"He is a convicted criminal, though he's entitled to say what he wants,\" said a spokesman. \"But it should be remembered that this case has been through an eight-week criminal trial with a verdict decided by a jury.</p> <p>\"The judge has heard not only the evidence but also the arguments by lawyers. Some people on the internet seem to think that Vickerman was just tried in front of a judge. He wasn't \u2013 this was a jury trial.\"</p> <p>Vickerman's case and the long sentence has surprised many. However Judge John Evans in &lt;a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/anton-vickerman-sentencing-remarks-14082012.pdf\"&gt;his sentencing remarks&lt;/a&gt; said that Vickerman had ignored the reality that another site, TV Links, which had done something similar had been taken offline following action by Fact.</p> <p>Judge Evans, presiding, said Vickerman had in some cases located files of films and uploaded them to sites, often in China, which he then linked back to on his site, and that forum messages, chat logs and emails sent and received by Vickerman indicated that he \"knew fine well\" that the site was not operating lawfully.</p> <p>He added that Vickerman took steps \"to keep both your location and your own personal identity secret\" so that policing his activity would be harder, and by registering domains outside the UK \"you would be both difficult to trace and be able\u2026 to escape the legislative regime that you knew you were offending\".</p> <p>Evans says that the losses estimated by the film industry \u2014 of between \u00a352m and \u00a3198m, on the basis that 55% of those who watched films via the site might instead have seen it in the cinema, rented a DVD or otherwise paid for it \u2014 was \"somewhat speculative\" but that the industry had undoubtedly \"suffered a loss running into millions\".</p> <p>In the trial, Vickerman said he could not remember the password to his encrypted computer without access to a keyboard \u2013 a claim the judge did not accept. \"You were deliberately obstructing the investigation,\" Judge Evans said. The judge added that Vickerman showed no remorse but \"I'm bound to say that in all the years I've worked in this court I have never encountered arrogance of the kind that you displayed during this trial.\"</p> <p>Vickerman is understood to be planning an appeal.</p>",
  "<p>Aerial spraying of insecticide is set to begin over Dallas on Thursday night as the city battles the worst outbreak of the West Nile virus in the US this year.</p> <p>Mayor Mike Rawlings has declared a state of emergency and announced the first aerial spraying in the city and its suburbs since 1966 in response to the growing number of victims of the virus, which spreads to humans via mosquito bites and is reaching epidemic proportions in north Texas.</p> <p>\"Right now, Texas has half the West Nile cases in the nation,\" Dr David Lakey, the Texas state health commissioner, told local reporters this week. \"Dallas County has half of the cases in the state of Texas. So, about a quarter of all the cases in the United States are in this county. So, this isn't business as usual.\"</p> <p>According to Texas department of state health services figures, 465 West Nile cases have been confirmed in Texas this year, including 17 related deaths \u2013 on track for the most cases since the disease first reached the state a decade ago.</p> <p>Ten deaths and more than 200 cases have been reported in Dallas County, which with a population of around 2.4 million is the ninth most populous county in the US. Houston, the largest city in Texas, has recorded seven cases and one fatality.</p> <p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that as of August 14, 43 states have reported West Nile infection in people, birds or mosquitoes this year, with over 80% of cases from six states: Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and California.</p> <p>The 693 human cases reported to CDC through the second week in August is the highest number for that time of year since the virus was first detected in the US in 1999. At least 26 people have died.</p> <p>According to Dallas officials, the pesticide to be used Thursday evening, called Duet, has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and is similar to products presently being used against mosquitoes at ground level. It will be applied overnight by Clarke, a spraying company, at low dosages of fewer than one ounce per acre by twin-engine aircraft flying at an altitude of 300 feet and a speed of 170mph.</p> <p>Mayor Rawlings said that the spray poses no health threat. \"I've been studying this closely, talked to a lot of people, the CDC, the EPA, and everybody says this is safe. Other cities have done this before \u2013 this is what New York City uses, this is what Sacramento's been doing for five years, and this dissipates very quickly and so there is no health effects proven and I think the science backs us up on that,\" he told HLN. </p> <p>\"Beneficial insects need hopefully to be gone and be down in the earth when it gets night, that's when mosquitoes come out. It does impact very small insects if they come in contact with it.\"</p> <p>West Nile virus was first discovered in the US in New York. Researchers believe it is spread when a mosquito bites an infected bird and then a person. Most cases occur in the summer, with the greatest risk of infection coming from late August to early September. The very young, old, pregnant and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.</p> <p>Most who contract the virus experience little or no adverse effects, but a small number \u2013 less than 1% \u2013 develop severe symptoms that can include neurological illness.</p> <p>Health officials advise minimizing the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes, for example by using insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, reducing outdoor activity around dawn and dusk and eliminating areas of standing water around homes.</p> <p>Dr Mike Merchant, an urban entomology specialist with Texas AgriLife Extension Service in Dallas, said it was uncertain why Texas has been so badly affected but an unusually warm winter and spring rainfall could be factors. <br>\"Mosquitoes started building up earlier than normal which increased the population,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Dr Merchant said that studies suggest that aerial spraying is a quick and effective way of reducing mosquito numbers. He does not believe that the high level of infection this year indicates a trend. \"The number of cases has fluctuated [since the virus arrived in the US],\" he said. \"I don't anticipate it's getting worse by any means. We'll have good and bad years.\"</p>",
  "<p>The standoff between Britain and Ecuador has raised the prospect of a major diplomatic incident <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/15/uk-arrest-julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuador\" title=\"\">if British police force an entry into the building</a>.</p> <p>Ecuadorian officials say that any such decision would be an outrageous breach of international law. British officials insist that if they did so, it would be within British law.</p> <p>Under international law, security forces across the world are not allowed to enter an embassy without the express permission of the ambassador \u2013 even though the embassy remains the territory of the host nation. The 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations codified the \"rule of inviolability\", which all nations observe because their own diplomatic missions are otherwise at risk elsewhere.</p> <p>However, the Foreign Office told Ecuador that it had the power to revoke the embassy's diplomatic status under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987. This act was passed by Parliament in the wake of the Libyan embassy crisis three years before, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/yvonne-fletcher\" title=\"\">PC Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead</a> from inside the embassy.</p> <p>Such a step might set a dangerous precedent by encouraging other governments to justify entering embassies to arrest dissidents seeking diplomatic asylum.</p> <p>If Ecuador challenged a revocation, ministers would have to argue at the high court that the mission, by harbouring Assange, had itself fallen foul of international law. The government used the power in 1988 to deal with squatters in the Cambodian embassy.</p> <p>The 1961 convention stresses that missions must respect local laws and not interfere in the host nation's internal affairs. The Metropolitan police says it has the power and right to arrest Assange for breach of bail if he steps outside the embassy.They have also delivered a letter to the embassy demanding that Assange surrender himself.</p> <p>A legal source at the Ecuador embassy claimed yesterday that the 1987 Act was established to stop a major threat such as terrorism or a nuclear threat.</p> <p>\"The law was established after the shooting of a police officer and would be invoked if the public are under threat. In this case, no one could argue that Assange's presence in this embassy is a threat to the British public,\" the source said.</p>",
  "<p>What a difference a year makes. Last summer TV bulletins and newspaper front pages were plastered with photos of youths looting shops wearing Adidas hoodies and trackies.</p> <p>This summer Adidas again featured on the front pages almost every day for a fortnight. This time on the sports kit of Team GB's Olympic gold medallists, and the odd royal or three.</p> <p>\"It is a real coup. Incredible publicity,\" says Imogen Power, a brand analyst at market research firm Mintel, of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry wearing Team GB polo shirts prominently featuring Adidas's logo.</p> <p>Mark Borkowski, a PR and branding expert, said: \"They just lucked out really with the royals. The young royals are probably a bit more relaxed about branding \u2013 30 years ago there would have been an uproar [if a member of the royal family was seen wearing branded clothing in public].</p> <p>But, Borkowski says, the athletes are more important than the royals. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/12/uk-riots-gangster-chic-brands\" title=\"\">A year ago they [Adidas] had front pages with every rioter wearing their clobber going in and nicking stuff</a>, now they have all these heroes wearing their gear. It is an amazing turnaround.</p> <p>\"They now have control over some of the best athletes who will prove to be a new set of heroes and heroines.\"</p> <p>It only cost Adidas \u00a3127m over five years to be a London 2012 \"tier one\" sponsor, according to Mintel \u2013 a sum seen as a bargain in the industry.</p> <p>\"It's money very well spent,\" Borkowski says. \"There will be lots of marketing people giving themselves high fives this weekend. The hype is going to carry the brand to new levels. The starting gun has only gone off now.\"</p> <p>Adidas has already started to count the benefit. Last week the German company, which is the official sportswear partner for the games and the kit provider to Team GB, said it had sold about \u20ac100m (\u00a378m) of Olympic-related merchandise. It is more than three times the amount it achieved from the Beijing 2008 Olympics (but a fraction of the \u20ac1.6bn it expects from football kits and associated products this year).</p> <p>Herbert Hainer, Adidas's chief executive, said: \"We are very happy with our sales, especially since the Olympic Games started. There are queues in our stores in Oxford Street and Stratford every day. People want to associate themselves with Team GB and the exposure we get through Team GB is excellent.\"</p> <p>YouGov's BrandIndex, which scores the public's reaction to brands, found Adidas's score increased from 4.2 on the day before the opening ceremony to 16.5 on Monday.</p> <p>Adidas' #takethestage campaign in the run up the Olympics and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/aug/12/olympics-team-gb-sing-queen-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">#stagetaken video featuring Team GB stares and David Beckham lip syncing to Queen's Don't Stop Me Now</a>, have proved particularly popular.</p> <p>Dr Dre also had a successful Olympics with an ambush marketing campaign that saw athletes, including Tom Daley and Michael Phelps, wearing his Beats headphones.</p> <p>The brand, which is not an official sponsor, skirted strict rules on ambush marketing by sending headphones to British team members branded with union flag colours.</p> <p>McDonald's also benefited from social media, with athletes excitedly tweeting about their fast food pig-outs after finishing the Olympic events.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CameronNicholGB/status/234797038502547456\" title=\"\">British rower Cameron Nichol tweeted: \"Every athlete in the wild wants a maccy d's\" and a picture of athletes queuing at the McDonald's inside the Olympic Park.</a></p>",
  "<p>Sophisticated, smooth and sensual, in the wrong hands Devotion could easily have been a footnote in the New Boring movement, that vibrant strain of youth culture that has already given us Emeli Sand\u00e9, Adele and Bruce Springsteen concerts that wrestle with the spacetime continuum itself. Yet Jessie Ware's debut album is saved by one fact: for all her album's poise and restraint, dance music clearly runs through this 27-year-old south Londoner's veins.</p> <p>A former guest vocalist for the dubstep-tinged likes of SBTRKT and Joker, Ware's teenage years were spent putting the graft in, researching her trade at drum'n'bass nights at Brixton's Mass. Yet until now she has always seemed more comfortable singing from the shadows rather than taking centre stage. \"Being a backing singer was my idea of heaven,\" she once said, which doesn't exactly suggest a cut-throat desire to elbow aside the competition. In fact, Ware barely set out to be a singer at all, originally settling on a career as a journalist before finding herself in the somewhat improbable situation of being jealous of Jack Pe\u00f1ate \u2013 a former schoolmate (as was Florence Welch and stray members of the Maccabees) \u2013 who had the gumption to go out looking for a record deal.</p> <p>Such reticence might be regarded as a stumbling block for a singer pushing out into solo-album territory. Yet one of the most enthralling things about Devotion is how Ware uses that restraint to her advantage. From the opening trickle of wind chimes to the delicate vocal refrain on closing track Something Inside, Devotion is&#xa0;by&#xa0;turns hushed, downbeat and unobtrusive. Yet unlike, say, Zomby or&#xa0;Kindness, eerie conceptualists mutating dance music into something unsettling, Devotion isn't in the business of playing fancy tricks with us. Rather, it's honest, heartfelt and warm. In many ways the record Devotion resembles most is Katy B's On a Mission. Not sonically \u2013 On a Mission was far more gregarious \u2013 but how it uses the colour palette of club culture as a starting point to paint broader pop pictures. It could be to that record what the 3am comedown is to the night before, or the Burial to Katy B's Benga, if you were after a particularly tortuous dubstep metaphor.</p> <p>Ware sums up her mission statement on 110%, a fluttering affair which owes a debt to Mr Fingers' Can You Feel It and, in its skittering drum pattern, Kelis and Andre 3000's Millionaire: \"I'll&#xa0;keep the dancefloor warm,\" she sings, before adding forlornly, \"but I'm&#xa0;still dancing on my own.\"</p> <p>Much like Robyn's own ode to dancing solo, Ware's lyrics often have a&#xa0;strikingly obsessive undertow. The distorted hip-hop sample that kicks off 110% is from Big Punisher's Dream Shatterer, a paean to the gangster lifestyle that boasts of \"carving my initials on your forehead\". Here, with the help of Bristolian house producer Julio Bashmore, Ware reappropriates the phrase, alluding instead to the power of furtive cross-dancefloor glances and the stamp of romantic ownership.</p> <p>Relationships are rarely plain-sailing on Devotion, nor something Ware feels in control of. Yet they're tackled head-on regardless. On the title track she pleads: \"Don't leave me in the dark, don't leave me this way.\" Sweet Talk, meanwhile, displays a confidence in her own willpower about as steady as the wobbly 80s keyboards: \"I thought you knew I had to stay away from you \u2026 yeah still you have the power.\" Wildest Moments, an Olympic-sized power ballad that somehow still oozes subtlety, has Ware describing a tumultuous friendship in which \"everyone must be wondering why we try\".</p> <p>Whether Ware's early experience as a&#xa0;football reporter \u2013 even covering matches for the Jewish Chronicle \u2013 helped her hone a simple, direct style is impossible to say. What's undeniable, though, is the fact that Ware has the sweetest vocal style yet to emerge from anyone who previously attended the crucial Boreham Wood v Arsenal XI friendly. Like Amy Winehouse, Ware once strived to sing like Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, and learned how to pack her voice with emotion. The results are on display through Devotion: Running is as slowly seductive as Sade, Ware's breathy tones surfing across the spotlight so that you barely notice the occasional guitar squalls, let alone Leo Taylor's laidback drumming.</p> <p>And that's the thing \u2013 throughout Devotion you're never told to sit up and pay attention. Instead it quietly works its magic, a genuinely individual statement by an artist who didn't expect to become a pop star, but might struggle to stop it happening anyway \u2013 after all, the groove is in her heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timjonze\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Follow @timjonze</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>  <p></p>",
  "<p><strong>What's so funny?</strong> Growing up mixed race in South Africa was a bit of a hoot \u2013 at least if <a href=\"http://www.trevornoah.com/\" title=\"\">Trevor Noah</a> is to be believed. Noah, now resident in the States, has been brought <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/mar/28/eddie-izzard-unrepeatable-dvd\" title=\"\">to the fringe by Eddie Izzard</a>, who is obviously a fan.</p> <p><strong>Is it easy to see why?</strong> Noah comes across as a lovely chap \u2013 and a smooth comedy operator. He's instantly and effortlessly in control of the room, and his material is insightful and entertaining, at least for most of the show.</p> <p><strong>I feel a \"but\" coming.</strong> The show tails off towards the end. Noah has 45 minutes of material on his upbringing, his feeling about race, and his emigration to the US, and then a tacked-on section with workaday stuff about satnav and funny foreign accents.</p> <p><strong>Let's focus on the good stuff.</strong> It's remarkable to be able to say, as Noah does, \"I was born a crime.\" Mixed-race relationships (Noah's dad was Swiss, his mum South African) were forbidden under apartheid. In public, Noah had to pretend someone else was his mum. And, being half-white, he got called \"master\" (as a joke) by his own granddad.</p> <p><strong>What a wonderful system that was.</strong> It certainly confused Noah, who grew up with conflicted racial allegiances (\"That's racist! \u2013 but I see what he means\") and headed to the US in the hope of healing his split identity.</p> <p><strong>Does it work?</strong> It must have done \u2013 because it would be hard to seem more at ease with yourself than Noah does. He positively cruises through the show \u2013 although the material (there's an interesting section about US racial terminology) has sharp edges. There's also an enjoyable paean to the black American vernacular. Then there's the satnav shtick.</p> <p><strong>In summary:</strong> The pedestrian ending only slightly detracts from this impressive fringe debut from a classy young comic.</p>",

Listen here</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Los Angeles.</p> <p><strong>The lineup: </strong>Jonathan Bates (vocals, guitar, electronics), Mahsa Zargaran (drums) and Amy Wood (drums).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> We couldn't believe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/15/new-band-tiger-love\" title=\"\">yesterday's new band</a> weren't already big because they fulfil so many hipster criteria. Today's new band we can't believe aren't already big because they sound so, well, big. They approach Muse levels of sonic hugeness. Their best tracks sound as though everything's been turned up to 11 or whatever one notch over the maximum would be, and the needles are mostly always in the red. </p> <p>Big Black Delta sound so massive, it's going to be weird if they don't actually become massive. Music this enormous surely needs a crowd to match. Bombast without an audience is a hollow thing indeed. With an audience it is spectacular. And if that sounds as though we're mixing up our senses \u2013 the aural and visual \u2013 it's deliberate: Jonathan Bates, whose brainchild Big Black Delta is, has synesthesia, where you see what you hear (and even sometimes taste what you touch and smell what you feel). He's also obsessed with astrology, space and UFOs, but what comes across most in his music as Big Black Delta is his unashamed love of electronic rock at its most pompous and preposterous. Bates \u2013 who used the question, \"If you didn't have standard pop music as a reference, what would your pop music sound like?\", as the starting point for Big Black Delta, is originally from Venezuela. His family moved to Miami when he was seven, and at 17 he attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, just like her from Monday's new band, psych-soul girl trio <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/13/new-band-king\" title=\"\">King</a>. Big Black Delta are not a psych-soul trio, girl or otherwise, although Bates does have two female drummers backing up his armoury of electronics and whatever it is he plays, which at last count was everything. \"Give me anything, and I'll make it work, especially if it's stringed,\" he has said.</p> <p>He used to be in a metal band called Mellowdrone, provided vocals and toured with M83 last year and has supported Jane's Addiction in the States. There are elements of M83's cosmic electronica in Big Black Delta, and something of Jane's baroque metal. Bates's debut album as Big Black Delta, BBDLP1, was recorded on a laptop he bought from his friend Alessandro Cortini from Nine Inch Nails, in a variety of apartments, houses and backyards belonging to friends in LA, usually during the night. Lyrically, he explains: \"It ties together healthy doses of astrophysics, conspiracy theories, old French films and whisky. It's supposed to be a sonic presentation of the starburst that you see right before you pass out.\" And it works, despite, or more likely because of, all the mania and eccentric input. The best tracks on BBDLP1 are the ones where the madness isn't reined in but fully unleashed. Opener Put the Gun on the Floor is a synth-heavy industrial fanfare complete with chorale. Capsize, like many of Bates's songs, is melodically simple, the emphasis placed on layers of sound, and how to maintain intensity. Huggin &amp; Kissin recalls Dave Gahan in full-tilt stadium preacher mode over a riff that apparently resulted from Bates trying to mimic heavy metal sturm und drang minus guitars. Betamax is his pop moment \u2013 he sounds light-headed, and it suits him. But the recent single IFUCKINGLOVEYOU is The One. It starts off epic and goes from there. It would be virtually impossible for anyone, let alone Bates and his laptop, to sustain this deluge, he'd have a heart attack. Still, credit to him for trying, because here and there BBDLP1 is like being mown down by squadrons of Valkyrie as they battle the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

  "<h2>VAN UTD? MAN PERSIE? <a href=\"http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/buitenlands/12767029/__Fatman_en_Robin__van_Persie___.html\" title=\"\">FATMAN AND ROBIN</a>?</h2> <p>On the one hand, Arsenal fans are in mourning over the sale of Robin van Persie to Manchester United (subject to a medical for a player about as knack-prone as a blindfolded toddler riding a skateboard down the stairs while juggling several pairs of scissors). On the other hand, Arsenal fans are in a celebratory mood because Van Persie's sale has led to a comical public meltdown from creepy celebrity stalker Piers Morgan, who took to Twitter last night to wail in the style of said blindfolded toddler at the end of his journey down the stairs on a skateboard while juggling several pairs of scissors. \"Waaaahhh!\" wailed Arsenal's top boy, stamping his feet and spitting his dummy out, to the amusement of even Arsene Wenger. \"It's not fair! Waaaaahhhhh!\" Given this reaction, it is more or less Arsenal's public duty to rename the club The Tottenham Hotspur Tribute Act and replace the statue of Thierry Henry outside the Emirates with one of Bill Nicholson.</p> <p>Van Persie's departure has been labelled by some as a betrayal, although the Fiver assumes the same people weren't complaining when Sol Campbell joined Arsenal from Spurs. Well, the first time anyway. But in reality, it's not. United and Arsenal might have been rivals in the past, Roy Keane once threatening to destroy the Highbury tunnel with his own bare hands, but no more, not since Wenger decided that winning trophies is for losers. The consequence of that approach has led to the likes of Henry, Patrick Vieira, Ashley Cole, Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri leaving, with Van Persie merely the latest to reject the Wenger Way.</p> <p>Last summer, Wenger had this to say about Fabregas and Nasri leaving: \"Imagine the worst situation \u2013 we lose Fabregas and Nasri \u2013 you cannot convince people you are ambitious after that.\" Both left, and Wenger's time at Arsenal reached an all-time low with the 8-2 thumping at Old Trafford. But this is not necessarily a disaster for the Gunners. After all, United could find that spending \u00a323m for a 29-year-old with one year left on his contract with a terrible knack record proves to be the worst piece of business since the Fiver opened a pork restaurant in Golders Green.</p> <p>With Santi Cazorla, Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski already having arrived at Arsenal, maybe the future is bright after all. And \u00a323m is a lot of money as well \u2013 a real chance for Wenger to push on, improve the squad even more and \u2026 hang on a minute. What's this? \"We have already recruited since we bought [Olivier] Giroud and [Lukas] Podolski, who originally were intended to offset the departure of Van Persie,\" deadpanned Wenger, preparing a deal to bring Teddy Sheringham out of retirement.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I am disappointed, bordering on a little bit of anger almost \u2026 It is difficult for someone like me who has an Arsenal gun sealed to his chest\" \u2013 Arsenal great and Very Placid Man Bob Wilson reveals he's nearly a tiny bit miffed at the Van Persie move. Possibly more worrying is his claim to seemingly have a Gooner-branded firearm attached to his person like some sort of Emirates-season-ticket-holding ED-209. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jts0xxg7P8I\" title=\"\">Or like this</a>.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\"Re: Ashley Gilbert's comment that 'if the universe were actually infinite it would contain, somewhere in it, everything that could possibly be' (yesterday's Fiver letters).

  "<p>When a mother was sent to a labour camp for protesting that the men who raped and prostituted her young daughter had been treated too leniently, it sparked fury in China.</p> <p>The public outcry led to Tang Hui's release, but did not end with her return home last week.</p> <p>The case has fuelled calls for the immediate reform of a system that means low-level offenders can be detained in forced-labour camps for up to four years without a trial or legal representation.</p> <p>The 39-year-old mother was sentenced to 18 months re-education through labour for \"seriously disturbing the social order and exerting a negative impact on society\" after she repeatedly petitioned officials in Yongzhou, Hunan, because she believed the sentences given to the men who kidnapped, raped and forced her 11-year-old daughter into prostitution should have been more severe.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people commented or forwarded posts about her ordeal. Since her release, attention has shifted to the general shortcomings of the system.</p> <p>In a poll of almost 20,000 internet users, posted by a well-known author on the Sina Weibo microblog service, 98% called for abolition of the system.</p> <p>The poll was later deleted, prompting some respondents to joke that it too had been sent to a labour camp.</p> <p>Ten well-known lawyers have now issued an open letter calling for change to \"re-education through labour\", which dates to the 1950s.</p> <p>China had 350 labour camps with 160,000 prisoners at the end of 2008, the last year for which figures are available. The inmates endure long working hours, often in heavy agricultural or factory roles, and receive political education.</p> <p>The justice ministry does not publish details on why people were detained, although in 2005 it suggested drug offences accounted for more than half the cases. The system is often used to deal with minor criminals, such as thieves and sex workers.</p> <p>The lawyers who wrote the letter say detaining critics has become an easy way to preserve stability. They want to see it abolished but say that in the short term it must at least be reformed to prevent the most egregious abuses.</p> <p>\"Now this system is being used more frequently in a more casual way,\" said Li Fangping, one of the authors, adding that petitioners, activists, dissidents and whistleblowers had been victims of it.</p> <p>Pang Kun, a signatory from a Guangdong law firm, said that suspects got as little as three days to prepare for their hearing, were often in detention for that period, and had no right to legal representation.</p> <p>He said they should be given more notice, should remain free before their case is heard and should be able to hire lawyers.</p> <p>The lawyers also say committees should release written statements explaining their decisions, and that those detained should have the right to appeal.</p> <p>\"I am pessimistic about whether the <em>laojiao</em> system can be abolished now as all different levels of governments still regard it as the useful tool to maintain the social stability,\" Pang added.</p> <p>Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based independent human rights scholar, said: \"You can deal with people who you consider to be problematic or threats to that social order without really having to justify it to anyone but yourselves.</p> <p>\"Decisions are essentially made by police \u2026 Even though they have a fancy name for [the hearing committees], when it's time to send someone to re-education through labour they just put the sign on the door.\"</p> <p>The ministries of justice and public security have yet to respond to the letter.</p> <p>There have been repeated calls for reform in recent years, often via the National People's Congress, the largely rubber-stamp legislature.</p> <p>Ying Yong, president of the Shanghai High People's Court, called for changes at the NPC session this spring.</p> <p>He pointed out that although the system was supposed to deal with cases not serious enough to constitute a crime, the penalties could be much stiffer than the six-month minimum term for criminal offences.</p> <p>Suspects can be sentenced to between one and three years in confinement. And the sentence can be extended by a year if authorities decide the detainee has not been sufficiently re-educated.</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Ever been for a 1.5km swim, got out on the other side and thought \"I really fancy going for a 40km bike ride\", and then finished that and thought \"What I need now is a quick 10km run\"? Wait, let me rewind. Ever been for a 1.5km swim? Me neither. Well, these guys do it every day before breakfast. A breakfast that consists of cycling. Followed by running.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>First, you love pain. Then, you apply that love of pain to the water, the wheels and the road. Different distances are recognised, from \"sprint\" (750m swim/20km cycle/5km run) to \"ultra\" (3.9km/180km/26.2 miles - yes, that's a full marathon on the end), but the most common - and the one competed in the Olympics - is that outlined above.</p> <p>The competitor is racing against the clock, with the transitions between sections also timed. Certain rules apply: for instance, racers must have their helmet on before mounting the bike.</p> <p>If you become proficient at the triathlon, perhaps you should think about grabbing a gun and stealing a horse and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/14/modern-pentathlon-olympics-2012-get-involved\">taking up the modern pentathlon</a>.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>As complete an all-round workout as they come, the triathlon combines the CV benefits of swimming, cycling and running and adds a dash of mega-endurance. These guys are nails.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>As with most specialist sports, equipment is big business for those with the means to afford it. Besides a good pair of running shoes, you'll need a decent bike in order to be competitive. The former will come in at around \u00a380 minimum, the latter from around \u00a3500. Many race in cutoff wetsuits called trisuits, which retail at around \u00a375.</p> <p>If you want to join a club, <a href=\"http://www.trifinder.co.uk/information/triathlon-club-directory/\">here's a list of every one in the UK</a>.

  "<p>Or, to use its alternative title: Ageing Alphas Assemble. Again. Two years ago, we were introduced to these freebooting soldiers of fortune in their&#xa0;golden years, led by menopausal hombre Barney Ross, played by Sylvester Stallone. They were called The Expendables, in an ironically defiant nod to their own status as cannon fodder, and to the fact that their old-school action heroism is now&#xa0;considered obsolete, and surplus to requirements, in today's bullshit world of tree-hugging political&#xa0;correctness. (Or maybe they once all starred in some forgotten 80s straight-to-VHS actioner called The Pendables.)</p> <p>Anyway, Sly'n'the guys had an adventure on the made-up island of \"Vilena\" and it all went terribly well, so now they return in a sequel which like the first film has been co-written by Stallone himself. As it says on the poster, they are \"back for war\", ie making a warlike reappearance for more of the same: this sets the keynote of rather modest wit and wordplay. There is some self-mocking entertainment to be had, but Stallone does seem to think that just getting all his old buddies to lumber up in the one place, as if opening some new branch of Planet Hollywood, is enough to earn our sentimental indulgence.</p> <p>Barney continues his gruff bromance with Brit second-in-command Lee (Jason Statham) and still&#xa0;on the crew is tousle-haired blond Gunner (Dolph Lundgren). Martial arts warrior Jet Li plays Yin Yang; as in the first film, he is picked on a bit for being Asian. At least this time he gets to kick some butt, but he bails out of the film pretty early on. His place on the crew is taken by sexy badass Maggie, played by Chinese screen star Nan Yu. These seniors also have a fresh-faced youngster on the team, Billy, played by&#xa0;Liam Hemsworth, for whom Barney has a fatherly tenderness. As before, two more faces on the Action Mount Rushmore loom out of the screen: the&#xa0;two paymasters, hard-faced Mr Church, played by Bruce Willis, and Trench, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger with that unreadable, crazy-eyed expression of scorn which seems to apply to whatever mood he's&#xa0;in.</p> <p>The guys make their initial appearance in a convoy of rusty old military vehicles, speeding aggressively towards some secure compound in Nepal, and&#xa0;coming in red-hot. What appalling activity is Sly so desperate to thwart? Has someone illegally stockpiled the&#xa0;world's entire reserves of Grecian&#xa0;2000 behind those walls? Is&#xa0;some horrible psycho holed up in there, about to push a button that will&#xa0;blow every Spanx factory on the globe sky-high?</p> <p>Well, it turns out to be about some nefarious sub-plot, whose function is to bring Barney once again into testy contact with his old nemeses Trench and Church, and so discover a plan devised by an evil-doer antipathetic to&#xa0;the interests of the United States, to&#xa0;tunnel into a disused mine where an&#xa0;unlimited amount of ex-Soviet nuclear material is to be found. This evil-doer is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, perhaps on the basis that only an action star hailing from within the borders of the European Union can be truly evil.</p> <p>When the first movie came out, I suspected that action fans might find the relatively brief appearances by Arnie and Bruce a swiz. Well, there is a similar tease in this film, which at one&#xa0;crucial stage torments us with the possibility of the most glorious iconic cameo. The&#xa0;guys are in a tight spot and&#xa0;some weapon-toting stranger, offscreen, helps them out. Who can it&#xa0;be? Stallone puts Sergio Leone on the&#xa0;soundtrack. I, and plenty of other journalists in the audience, almost rose&#xa0;to our feet and looked at each other in wild surmise. Not \u2026 not Clint! You're kidding! Clint? Clint! Clint? Is it Clint? Clint!</p> <p>No. It's not Clint. And Sly might be in big trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (or something) for using that music. It's a big name in action circles \u2013 a great name in many ways \u2013 but not Clint.</p> <p>Anyway, as with all action movies we're hoping for some great taglines, little insouciant bon mots that true action heroes casually drop after some piece of mayhem. Sly blows someone to smithereens and says: \"Rest in pieces.\" Ouch. Good one. At one stage, he chances upon a pack of wild dogs, fires his gun into the air to make them scatter and then says: \"Take off, Rover.\" Fido or Rex wouldn't have worked nearly as well.</p> <p>There's some comedy in there, too, intentional \u2013 mostly. As a poignant study of the ageing process, it's on a&#xa0;rough par with The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. For The Expendables 3, they might want to consider enlisting Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Judi Dench.</p>",
  "<h2>Telling the truth</h2> <p>Most plays are fictions, acts of the imagination. But some of course, purport to be true, particularly those that use verbatim techniques. Verbatim theatre has always been very strong on the idea of the \"authentic\", something I've always found odd as any verbatim play is as much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2007/may/07/foreditorsdoesverbatimthea\">an act of creative editing</a> as a drama play conjured from its author's imagination.

But as I said in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/06/agony-and-ecstasy-steve-jobs-review\">my review of Daisey's play </a>when I saw it at High Tide in the spring following the controversy, when Daisey was in the process of reworking it, theatre should never be governed by the rules of journalism. We just need to know that what we are watching is fiction. </p> <p>So it's all the more intriguing to see the piece (Daisey has made it available to be performed for free and there have been around 30 productions worldwide) when it's being performed by an actor \u2013 Grant O'Rouke, very good \u2013 as it is at the Gilded Balloon during the festival. The strange thing is that seeing it acted in no way detracts from its considerable power. As Joyce Macmillian comments <a href=\"http://joycemcmillan.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/the-agony-and-the-ecstasy-of-steven-jobs-educating-ronnie-i-tommy/\">here</a> , it remains a frighteningly timely piece of work.</p> <h2>All in the timing</h2> <p>Noel Coward's Tonight at Eight is a reminder that the time theatre starts is open to fluctuation and social trends. Most theatre now starts at 7.30pm, which makes it all the more a novelty in Edinburgh when you can see theatre from 10am in the morning to past midnight. As Orla O'Loughlin observed in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/09/orla-o-loughlin-edinburgh-festival \">brief interview</a> seeing a show at a strange time of day often makes you more receptive to it. </p> <p>Last night I was booked into the <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk\">Traverse</a> for the 11pm performance of Kieran Hurley's Beats. I was dead on my feet and about to turn into a pumpkin. A show woven around the 1994 criminal justice and order act that outlawed raves, which comes with the promise of loud music and flashing lights, just didn't sound like my sort of thing. I was wrong. The late start time and my exhaustion only added to the hallucinatory power of a piece about community, the threads that bind us together and the fact that however many laws they pass or policemen they deploy, no government has ever found a way to arrest people's imaginations.</p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>Overheard by one of my colleagues on the bus on the way back from the Lowland Hall production of Meine faire Dame \u2013 ein Sprachlabor. \"I suppose putting it out here ensures that nobody can walk out early.\" </p> <p>Girl in Pleasance Dome: \"I came to Edinburgh for fun, but it's been nothing but hard work.\"</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of police breaking into the Ecuadorean embassy in London any time soon to arrest Julian Assange and extradite him to Sweden for questioning on allegations of sexual offences does not seem very imminent.</p> <p>Despite the dramatic announcement on Thursday by Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, that his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-political-asylum-ecuador\" title=\"\">country granted asylum to the WikiLeaks founder</a>, little in reality has changed. Assange is unable to leave the embassy as he would still face immediate arrest.</p> <p>Instead, the latest episode of the Assange stalemate is only responsible for a deepening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum\" title=\"\">diplomatic row between the UK and Ecuador</a>, with London claiming it has a \"legal duty to extradite\" Assange and Ecuador claiming that means London is threatening to break in and grab the Australian.</p> <p>With both sides boxed into their respective corners what is likely in the short term, as legal experts have been quick to make clear, is recourse again to the courts.</p> <p>What have changed significantly, however, are the diplomatic implications, less importantly for Britain's relationship with Ecuador, than for the fact that London will want to avoid setting an international precedent that might be used one day against one of its own missions abroad. But the British government is facing a catch-22 situation, being equally anxious \u2013 as former diplomat <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2012/08/16/oliver-miles/why-havent-they-asked-for-him/\" title=\"\">Oliver Miles pointed out in the London Review of Books</a> \u2013 to avoid setting the opposing precedent of allowing Assange to remain as a fugitive within the embassy in defiance of a European arrest warrant.</p> <p>This very prospect was raised by Britain's former ambassador to Moscow, Tony Brenton, in an interview with the BBC.</p> <p>\"I think the Foreign Office have slightly overreached themselves here,\" he said. \"If we live in a world where governments can arbitrarily revoke immunity and go into embassies then the life of our diplomats and their ability to conduct normal business in places like Moscow, where I was, and North Korea becomes close to impossible.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live#block-502cd7d495cb03723d6abd04\" title=\"\">letter sent by the British embassy</a> in Quito to the Ecuadorean government \u2013 and disclosed by Ecuador \u2013 makes reference to the \"legal base\" under which the British government believes it could arrest Assange. It refers specifically to the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, a dry and technical piece of legislation governing the law of how ministers should handle the designation of both diplomatic premises and former premises. Indeed, it has been used before to evict squatters from a Cambodian embassy building.</p> <p>Significantly, it details how \u2013 although not in what circumstances save for issues of public safety and national security \u2013 the foreign secretary can \"de-recognise\" a mission. Ecuador has said it would regard such an act as \"hostile and intolerable\".</p> <p>\"You need to be aware,\" the letter says, \"that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy.</p> <p>\"We sincerely hope that we do not reach that point, but if you are not capable of resolving this matter of Mr Assange's presence in your premises, this is an open option for us.\"</p> <p>As law lecturer <a href=\"http://www.headoflegal.com/2012/08/15/julian-assange-can-the-uk-withdraw-diplomatic-status-from-the-ecuadorian-embassy/\" title=\"\">Carl Gardner blogged on Wednesday</a>, while the act gives ministers the \"power of de-recognition\" \u2014 which would allow Assange's arrest in the embassy regardless of whether Ecuador grants him asylum \u2013 quite how that process could play out is uncertain.</p> <p>According to that law, \"the secretary of state [can] withdraw his acceptance or consent in relation to land\", meaning \"it&#xa0;\u2026 ceases to be diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of all enactments and rules of law\".</p> <p>The catch, however, is to be found in the following section, which states that any de-recognition must be consistent with international law \u2013 in this case the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations which Ecuadorean sources at the embassy say they have acted in accordance with.</p> <p>In other words, any attempt to de-recognise the embassy would in all likelihood need to be tested in the courts or by judicial review, a costly and lengthy process.</p> <p>The same point was made by lawyer and New Statesman legal blogger David Allen Green.</p> <p>\"As the UK government will be purporting to be exercising a statutory provision \u2013 in this case a power under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 \u2013 then any executive action is in principle amenable to the jurisdiction of the high court for judicial review. Here it would be Ecuador challenging the UK government in a case that would raise complex points of domestic and international public law.\"</p> <p>What is not clear, either from the act itself or the letter, is on what grounds the British government would feel it had for de-recognition to allow Assange's arrest, although the letter makes clear that the Foreign Office believes Ecuador is in breach of the 1961 Vienna convention.</p> <p>One possibility is that the British government could attempt to invoke the convention's preamble, which insists that the specific purpose of \"the immunities and privileges\" that it lists are \"not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing states\".</p> <p>That argument has not been tried before in the few instances where people have sought refuge in embassies.</p> <p>However the convention \u2013 while accepting that the UK can declare members of the mission, or all of them, persona non grata \"without explanation\" \u2014 also insists in Article 22: \"The premises of the mission shall be inviolable. The agents of the receiving state may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.\"</p> <p>And so Assange stays put for now.</p>",
  "<h2>A little catch up</h2> <p>What's that? Other things happened during the first fortnight of August? Are you sure? I spent the two weeks at the Excel in my little Games Maker uniform so can surely be forgiven for forgetting that there was a real, non-leisurewear clad world still turning out there. But turn it did and, among other news, there were a number of exciting beauty launches that may have passed us by while we've all been having a jolly old time in our Olympic bubble. In times of post-fun blues, it's always good to have something on hand to cheer ourselves up with, so let me help you with re-entry into the real world with my pick of the top three launches you may have missed over the last two weeks...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394868789\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/16/1345114649610/Revlon-ColourStay-LongWea-008.jpg\" alt=\"Revlon ColourStay LongWear Nail Polish\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revlon ColourStay LongWear Nail Polish Photograph: Revlon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Revlon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <strong>Nails, nails nails.</strong> When will we ever tire of new ways to decorate our digits?

With 28 shades (twice as many my previous favourite gel range from Bourjois), a super-practical fan-shaped brush, and more importantly a shiny finish that lasts for a very, very long time, Revlon have really come up trumps again. <br> \u2022 <strong>Never heard </strong>of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/dec/05/brief-history-of-jurlique\">Jurlique</a>? It's a great brand that really is worth a little investigation. This month they introduced the small but perfectly formed <strong>Hydra Control</strong> collection (top) \u2013 four deeply moisturising products in another of Jurlique's wonderfully subtle fragrances. I've been particularly enjoying the scrub (\u00a315 for 150ml, <a href=\"http://www.jurlique.co.uk/\">jurlique.co.uk</a>) \u2013 not one of those painful, sandpapery affairs, but a very pleasant gentle exfoliant to use a couple of times a week. And the body lotion (\u00a320 for 250ml) is simply gorgeous.

Called <strong>Golden Jungle</strong>, it's a beautiful mix of khakis, bronzes and golds. The lighter shades still acceptable for shimmery summery looks, and the darker shades will take you right through winter.

  "<p>The sad fact is, when it comes to science, you can have as much data to support your claim as you like, you can have it rigorously tested, repeated, <a href=\"http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/peer-review.html\">peer-reviewed</a>, published, referenced copiously and awarded a Nobel prize, you can do all this, but if a competing theory has any element of celebrity endorsement, that's the one most people are going to hear about. Even if it's scientifically ludicrous. Actually, especially if it's scientifically ludicrous. Just look at<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12135402\"> Power Balance</a> wrist bands.</p> <p>Celebrities promoting dubious science and scientists getting annoyed about it are <a href=\"http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/science-for-celebrities.html\">nothing new</a>. I guess this is understandable to a certain extent when you consider the sort of lives <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-reasons-you-should-never-take-advice-from-celebrities/\">celebrities must lead</a>, which must distort your world view somewhat. This is probably doubly true for famous actors, as their job is basically pretending that fictional worlds are real. That's got to rub off on you at some point.</p> <p>But it's a depressingly common tactic for those who benefit from promoting or selling things contradicted by science to cite the <a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/world/named-and-shamed-celeb-pseudo-science-pedlars-178465.html\">supportive</a> famous <a href=\"http://www.chopra.com/whyisgodlaughing/foreword\">person</a> as a substitute for genuine evidence. The latest example of this is a gushing <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/homeopathic-healing-the-stars-who-swear-1259620\">puff-piece in the Mirror about celebrities who use homeopathy</a>. </p> <p>For those not yet familiar with homeopathy, it's essentially a form of alternative medicine that argues that if you are suffering from an illness, then you take a substance that is known to cause the same symptoms as the illness or malady (eg if you have insomnia, use caffeine), dilute this substance down to the point where there's none of it left in the water, then shake that water or slap it with a leather book (depends on who you ask, it seems), then sprinkle drops of the shaken/slapped water onto sugar pills and sell it to the general public as medicine.</p> <p>Thing is, I'm not even slightly exaggerating for comic effect, that's how homeopathy supposedly works. This isn't mentioned anywhere in the celebrity article mentioned above, which I think is very telling. It does claim that \"more than 10 million people in the UK\" swear by it though. That's around 15% of the entire UK population. Can that be right? I've never met anyone who swears by it in my 30 years. I've known plenty who swear about it though, are they counting them as part of that number?</p> <p>I'm not going to devote an article to criticising homeopathy, there are plenty of people who <a href=\"http://www.quackometer.net/blog/\">can do that better</a>. There are plenty of people who argue in favour of homeopathy, for<a href=\"http://aliceingalaxyland.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/and-therefore.html\"> numerous reasons</a>, but it seems to be running into a lot of adversity these days, and it would be easy to interpret this latest media outburst as an attempt to boost support.</p> <p>I've been known to make fun of homeopathy <a href=\"http://sciencedigestive.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/my-application-for-job-as-homeopath.html\">before now</a>, so obviously I'm not impartial. But in all seriousness,<a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=853977&amp;show=abstract\"> people are influenced by celebrity endorsements</a>, and if this leads to choices that could negatively affect people's health, that's not good at all. Ergo, I feel duty bound to present an antidote for these potentially damaging celebrity testimonials. Homeopathy argues that<a href=\"http://www.healthcare-natural.com/Homeopathy/Homeopathy_Like_cures_like.aspx\"> like cures like</a>, but science states that for every action there is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law\">equal but opposite reaction</a>. So what would be an equal-but-opposite reaction to an article which is essentially real celebrities endorsing a fictional medicine?</p> <p>Obviously, it would be endorsements of real medicine. From fictional celebrities.

  "<p>An inquiry into allegations of race-fixing, rumoured to be connected to the murder of a member of a jockey's family, is to be launched by Racing Victoria, the sport's governing body in the Australian state.</p> <p>At a conference earlier on Thursday, the integrity commissioner Sal Perna said that he believed the investigation would reveal that the sport was free of widespread corruption.</p> <p>\"The inquiry aims to identify systemic integrity issues across the three codes, thoroughbred, harness and greyhounds, in relation to race-fixing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I do not believe there are widespread integrity issues within the racing industry in Victoria. However, as an independent authority with the mandate to oversee the integrity of racing across the three codes in Victoria, I have a duty to address these allegations.\"</p> <p>The latest allegations to emerge in Australia concern jockey Danny Nikolic, who was the subject of a 2010 investigation that failed to establish evidence of wrongdoing in his relationship with a punter.</p> <p>A spokesman for Betfair confirmed to the Australian media that it has handed betting records to authorities, but denied local reports that it had launched its own investigation into betting on specific races.</p> <p>Nikolic has previously denied any wrongdoing, but declined to comment on the latest allegations. \"I'm just putting my head down and will chip away,\" he said.</p> <p>However, organised crime detectives from the Purana crime taskforce in Victoria, which investigated the infamous Melbourne gangland killings which took place between 1998 and 2010, have confirmed that they are investigating the possibility that the race-fixing allegations may be linked to the murder of trainer Les Samba - Nikolic's former father-in-law, killed in February 2011.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Victoria police offered a reward of more than \u00a3600,000 for information that would lead to the killers of 60-year-old racehorse trainer Samba, shot dead in a Melbourne suburb.</p> <p>The deputy commissioner Graham Ashton said: \"[Purana] felt if they could deal with this race-fixing allegation it may assist us in solving the murder so it's just one of a number of lines of inquiry that are being followed.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Olympics will create four millionaire sportsmen and women from Britain's pool of gold medal-winners, sports agents predict.</p> <p>Jessica Ennis, Victoria Pendleton, Sir Chris Hoy and Mo Farah could each earn upwards of \u00a31m a year by signing enhanced endorsement deals and banking higher appearance fees.</p> <p>Jon Ridgeon, a former Olympic hurdler who is now a director at the sports marketing company Fast Track, said: \"[The British team] was so successful that most gold medallists won't make life-changing amounts [of money]. It is difficult to stand out. But for the top bracket \u2013 the likes of Jess Ennis, Vicky Pendleton, Chris Hoy and Mo Farah \u2013 they can earn \u00a31m to \u00a33m a year. Their challenge is longevity. For those that didn't [win gold] there will be a dramatic decline in revenues going forward.\"</p> <p>The tennis gold medallist Andy Murray and the road cycling champion Bradley Wiggins already earn millions from their sports, and other athletes enjoyed a surge in earnings in the runup to London.</p> <p>Jessica Ennis Ltd, the heptathlete's image rights company, made a profit of \u00a3531,799 in the year to the end of September 2011, according to the latest accounts filed with Companies House. As recently as 2009 the company's profits were \u00a374,343, and its cash reserves have grown over the same period from \u00a3145,700 to \u00a3801,250. The figures apply to the company and come after any salary Ennis may have drawn.</p> <p>Ennis, who has sponsorship deals with brands ranging from British Airways to Olay beauty products, is likely to prove even more marketable as a gold medal-winner. Her main female rival is Pendleton, who retired from competitive cycling after the Games and who has deals to endorse brands including Halfords bikes, Hovis bread and Pantene beauty products.</p> <p>The accounts for Pendleton's image rights company, Invictus V, show profits of \u00a3234,719 last year, up from \u00a3274 in 2009, and cash reserves of \u00a3539,767 at the end of 2011. Again, the numbers will not include salary, which in Pendleton's case is estimated to be in the region of \u00a3500,000 a year.</p> <p>Hoy's company, Trackstars, booked profits of \u00a3406,693 last year and had a bank balance of \u00a3158,565. Farah's company made a profit of \u00a3104,203 in 2011 and had cash of \u00a336,498. The distance runner can earn substantial sums by competing, with his stated aim of running in the London Marathon potentially offering up to \u00a31m in appearance fees alone.</p> <p>For other athletes, great financial rewards over the next few years look less likely. Rebecca Adlington, who won double gold in Beijing, had been highly successful in attracting endorsement deals in the runup to this summer, but two bronzes at the Aquatics Centre mean she is expected to be less in demand.</p> <p>Even some of the Games' biggest success stories look like also-rans when it comes to attracting large endorsements. The Kenyan runner David Rudisha's 800m world record was praised by Lord Coe as the standout performance of London 2012, but Oliver Hunt, a partner at the sports law firm Onside Law, which represents Pendleton, said: \"It is difficult to think how marketable [Rudisha] will be. Is he really well-known enough in the big markets, and what type of endorsements would come his way? Although he was amazing, when all the fuss dies down you wonder if he can [earn millions].\"</p> <p>Agents question whether Usain Bolt's success in defending his two sprint titles will increase his value, as he was already at the top of his sport and recognisable around the world. In a Forbes list of the best-paid Olympians, Bolt was the only athlete in the top 10 who was not a tennis or basketball player, coming in seventh with yearly earnings of $20.3m.</p> <p>The bulk of that income is believed to come via endorsements and sponsor bonuses. Bolt's most lucrative backer is Puma, which reportedly pays $9m annually.</p>",
  "<p>Ecuador has now made its decision: to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live#block-502ce9b8b579b8532ead409f\" title=\"\">grant political asylum to Julian Assange</a>. This comes in the wake of an incident that should dispel remaining doubts about the motives behind the UK/Swedish attempts to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. On Wednesday, the UK government made an unprecedented <a href=\"http://www.ecuadorembassyuk.org.uk/announcements/ecuador-shock-at-threats-from-british-government\" title=\"\">threat to invade Ecuador's embassy if Assange is not handed over</a>. Such an assault would be so extreme in violating international law and diplomatic conventions that it is difficult to even find an example of a democratic government even making such a threat, let alone carrying it out.</p> <p>When Ecuadorian foreign minister Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, in an angry and defiant response, released the written threats to the public, the UK government tried to backtrack and say it wasn't a threat to invade the embassy (which is another country's sovereign territory). But what else can we possibly make of this wording <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2188946/UK-Government-extradite-Wikileaks-boss-Julian-Assange.html\" title=\"\">from a letter delivered by a British official</a>?</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy. We sincerely hope that we do not reach that point, but if you are not capable of resolving this matter of Mr Assange's presence in your premises, this is an open option for us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Is there anyone in their right mind who believes that the UK government would make such an unprecedented threat if this were just about an ordinary foreign citizen wanted for questioning \u2013 not criminal charges or a trial \u2013 by a foreign government?</p> <p>Ecuador's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live#block-502ce9b8b579b8532ead409f\" title=\"\">decision to grant political asylum to Assange</a> was both predictable and reasonable. But it is also a ground-breaking case that has considerable historic significance.</p> <p>First, the merits of the case: Assange clearly has a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to be extradited to Sweden. It is pretty much acknowledged that he would be immediately thrown in jail. Since he is not charged with any crime, and the Swedish government has no legitimate reason to bring him to Sweden, this by itself is a form of persecution.</p> <p>We can infer that the Swedes have no legitimate reason for the extradition, since they were repeatedly offered the opportunity to question him in the UK, but rejected it, and have also refused to even put forth a reason for this refusal. A few weeks ago the Ecuadorian government offered to allow Assange to be questioned in its London embassy, where Assange has been residing since 19 June, but the Swedish government refused \u2013 again without offering a reason. This was an act of bad faith in the negotiating process that has taken place between governments to resolve the situation.</p> <p>Former Stockholm chief district prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem also made it clear that the Swedish government had no legitimate reason to seek Assange's extradition when he testified that the decision of the Swedish government to extradite Assange is \"<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/48396086/Assange-Case-Opionion-Sven-Erik-Alhem\" title=\"\">unreasonable and unprofessional, as well as unfair and disproportionate</a>\", because he could be easily questioned in the UK.</p> <p>But, most importantly, the government of Ecuador agreed with Assange that he had a reasonable fear of a second extradition to the United States, and persecution here for his activities as a journalist. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-right-asylum\" title=\"\">The evidence</a> for this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/02/julian-assange-right-fear-prosecution\" title=\"\">was strong</a>. Some examples: an ongoing investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks in the US; evidence that an indictment had already been prepared; statements by important public officials such as Democratic senator Diane Feinstein that he should be prosecuted for espionage, which carries a potential death penalty or life imprisonment.</p> <p>Why is this case so significant? It is probably the first time that a citizen fleeing political persecution by the US has been granted political asylum by a democratic government seeking to uphold international human rights conventions. This is a pretty big deal, because for more than 60 years the US has portrayed itself as a proponent of human rights internationally \u2013 especially during the cold war. And many people have sought and received asylum in the US.</p> <p>The idea of the US government as a human rights defender, which was believed mostly in the US and allied countries, was premised on a disregard for the human rights of the victims of US wars and foreign policy, such as the 3 million Vietnamese or <a href=\"http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/iraq\" title=\"\">more than one million Iraqis</a> who were killed, and millions of others displaced, wounded, or abused because of US actions. That idea \u2013 that the US should be judged only on what it does within its borders \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/mar/11/state-department-human-rights\" title=\"\">is losing support</a> as the world grows more multipolar economically and politically, Washington loses power and influence, and its wars, invasions, and occupations are seen by fewer people as legitimate.</p> <p>At the same time, over the past decade, the US's own human rights situation has deteriorated. Of course prior to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, millions of African-Americans in the southern states didn't have the right to vote, and lacked other civil rights \u2013 and the consequent international embarrassment was part of what allowed the civil rights movement to succeed. But at least by the end of that decade, the US could be seen as a positive example internally in terms of the rule of law, due process and the protection of civil rights and liberties.</p> <p>Today, the US claims the legal right <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-the-united-states-still-the-land-of-the-free/2012/01/04/gIQAvcD1wP_story.html\" title=\"\">to indefinitely detain its citizens</a>; the president can order the assassination of a citizen without so much as even a hearing; the government can spy on its citizens without a court order; and its officials are immune from prosecution for war crimes. It doesn't help that the US has less than 5% of the world's population but almost a quarter of its prison inmates, many of them victims of a \"war on drugs\" that is <a href=\"http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/reports/\" title=\"\">rapidly losing legitimacy</a> in the rest of the world. Assange's successful pursuit of asylum from the US is another blow to Washington's international reputation. At the same time, it shows how important it is to have democratic governments that are independent of the US and \u2013 unlike Sweden and the UK \u2013 will not collaborate in the persecution of a journalist for the sake of expediency. Hopefully other governments will let the UK know that threats to invade another country's embassy put them outside the bounds of law-abiding nations.</p> <p>It is interesting to watch pro-Washington journalists and their sources look for self-serving reasons that they can attribute to the government of Ecuador for granting asylum. Correa wants to portray himself as a champion of free speech, they say; or he wants to strike a blow to the US, or put himself forward as an international leader. But this is ridiculous.</p> <p>Correa didn't want this mess and it has been a lose-lose situation for him from the beginning. He has suffered increased tension with three countries that are diplomatically important to Ecuador \u2013 the US, UK and Sweden. The US is Ecuador's largest trading partner and has several times threatened to cut off trade preferences that support thousands of Ecuadorian jobs. And since most of the major international media has been hostile to Assange from the beginning, they have used the asylum request to attack Ecuador, accusing the government of a \"crackdown\" on the media at home. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jan/08/ecuador-press-freedom-media\" title=\"\">As I have noted elsewhere</a>, this is a gross exaggeration <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/21/rights-groups-lost-plot-ecuador\" title=\"\">and misrepresentation of Ecuador</a>, which has an uncensored media that is mostly opposed to the government. And for most of the world, these misleading news reports are all that they will hear or read about Ecuador for a long time.</p> <p>Correa made this decision because it was the only ethical thing to do. And any of the independent, democratic governments of South America would have done the same. If only the world's biggest media organisations had the same ethics and commitment to freedom of speech and the press.</p> <p>Now we will see if the UK government will respect international law and human rights conventions and allow Assange safe passage to Ecuador.</p>",

I phoned three universities, and while I knew I had missed the grade requirements for both my firm and insurance choices, my insurance choice hadn't released me. Initially, I didn't know that this meant other universities couldn't view my application, so I was met with further rejection when I called universities, which was really disheartening. When I eventually got through to the School of Languages and Social Sciences at Aston, the lady guided me through how to get released and then go through Clearing properly. The whole process took a lot longer than I had expected. It was definitely a test of my determination and self-belief.</p> <p>\"But university so far has been one of the best experiences of my life. My course has been exciting and challenging, and looking back, as terrifying as Clearing was, it was worth every second for all that I've learned over the past three years.</p> <p>My tip is to do your research as early as possible. Look at what courses are available, and the entry requirements, and look at university websites to find out more about them.

I did, and was accepted.</p> <p>\"I'd never been to Hull prior to freshers' week and so did not know what to expect. But that meant I had no preconceptions. The engineering department staff were very approachable, and I got involved in lots of extra-curricular activities including Formula Student, an international competition where teams of uni students compete to design, test and build a racing car.

  "<p>In March, Senegal came of age as a democracy. After 12 years in office, the country's 86-year-old president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/26/senegalese-president-admits-defeat-election\" title=\"\">Abdoulaye Wade, ceded electoral defeat to his popular rival</a> Macky Sall. The republic had proved it was capable of managing democratic transitions of power.</p> <p>On 1 July, elections to the national assembly \u2013 the lower of Senegal's two French-style legislative bodies \u2013 confirmed Sall's victory, with his Benno Bokk Yakaar (BBY) coalition comfortably beating Wade's Parti D\u00e9mocratique S\u00e9n\u00e9galais (PDS).</p> <p>But as the new government settles down to business, it is becoming clear that this year's elections have been more than a test for democracy in the west African country. Sixty four of the 150 new representatives in the national assembly are women, a development cited as a landmark step towards gender equality.</p> <p>\"Having this record number of female parliamentarians is excellent not only for women in Senegal but in the entire sub-region,\" said Hawa Ba, Senegal officer at the Dakar-based <a href=\"http://www.osiwa.org/\" title=\"\">Open Society Initiative for West Africa</a>.</p> <p>In 2010, Senegal's <a href=\"http://unwomenwestafrica.blog.com/files/2011/06/Reflexions-on-Gender-Parity-in-Africa.pdf\" title=\"\">gender parity law</a> came into force, which requires political parties to ensure that at least half their candidates in local and national elections are women. The law is viewed by many as a necessary step to force change in a country with complex gender dynamics, influenced by traditional customs and beliefs, Islam and French colonialism. More than half of Senegal's 12.5 million population is female and although women have long organised at a local level, forming co-operatives and associations to improve access to public services, this has not translated easily into power at parliamentary level.</p> <p>\"This high representation will raise self-esteem among women in a predominantly male-dominated society where politics is largely viewed as a man's business,\" said Ba. \"For young girls, the image of a parliament in which women are a significant majority clearly illustrates the limitless bounds of opportunities and the possibility of access to any sphere of [the] decisionmaking process.\"</p> <p>But criticism of the parity law, and its newly felt effects on the national assembly, has been mounting in Senegal in recent weeks. El Hadji Diouf, a prominent Senegalese lawyer, <a href=\"http://www.leral.net/Me-El-Hadj-Diouf-promet-de-s-attaquer-a-la-parite_a49406.html\" title=\"\">has been outspoken in his condemnation</a>, and has threatened to propose new legislation striking down the measures. \"This law is an injustice. It is pure humbug coupled with political fraud,\" Diouf said last month. \"It will slow down development. Instead, we must have the courage to tell women that they will not be given an easy route into politics as a gift [without working for it].\"</p> <p>Pape Diogaye Faye, chairman of the PDS in the town of Mbour in the central region of Senegal, said: \"The parity law was one of the worst mistakes of the outgoing Wade government \u2013 it was a fatal blow against Senegalese democracy.\"</p> <p>And some voters \u2013 even those who support the goal of gender equality in Senegalese politics \u2013 are concerned that candidates were not chosen on merit. \"The initiative of gender parity is a good one, but I'm not sure Senegal is ready for this,\" said Amadou Diop, a male voter in Dakar. \"Women going to the national assembly need to be better educated \u2013 I have no issue with them being elected if they are chosen based on skills, but I do have a problem with them being elected simply because they are women.\"</p> <p>The inauguration comes at a time when jubilation in Senegal has begun to give way to the reality of governing a country facing severe development challenges. Senegal is ranked 155 out of 187 in the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/\" title=\"\">2011 UNDP Human Development Index</a> and faces not only massive youth unemployment \u2013 with 44% of its population now under 15 \u2013 but also shrinking agriculture, depleting fish stocks, persistent food insecurity and long-term infrastructure challenges.</p> <p>But some in Senegal believe that women are uniquely placed to confront the country's needs. \"Women parliamentarians are better placed to plead for more human socio-economic policies in Senegal,\" said Ba. \"Women are the ones who deal, on a daily basis, [with] the reality of hard life conditions for the over 70% of the population who live below the poverty line. It is women who line up for long hours under the sun to find the precious gas, water and bread when the state fails to do what it was supposed to do to guarantee proper public services and equal access to resources.\"</p>",
  "<p>Watch out, here comes Boris, John Bercow and, yes, it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/15/richard-branson-railways-virgin-empire\" title=\"\">Richard Branson</a>, all waving their \"look at me\" placards. It's mid-August and a familiar cast of silly season characters is finally free to fight its way into the headlines after frustrating weeks behind the enormous barrier of the London Olympics.</p> <p>The Olympics had its own silly season sub-plots aplenty, but at least it was a real event with a real narrative drive, one which might have turned out badly \u2013 tragedy or farce \u2013 but became an unexpected triumph. The row over expat cricket star Kevin Pietersen's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/15/kevin-pietersen-andrew-strauss-warning\" title=\"\">text messages</a> \u2013childish and disloyal \u2013 ahead of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/16/england-south-africa-live-obo\" title=\"\">Lords Test</a> is also a proper yarn, though England supporters could have done without it. We're not quite in the new football season yet.</p> <p>None of which can be said of Boris's latest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/15/boris-johnson-pm-pussyfooting-london-airport\" title=\"\">\"stop pussyfooting around\"</a> message to David Cameron and George Osborne (it's the lead story in today's Times) let alone Mr Speaker Bercow's most recent outburst, courtesy of Radio 4 on a slow news day, against his \"embittered\" critics on the Tory benches at Westminster and their \"low-grade, sub-standard, low music hall drivel\" allies in the media.</p> <p>It's not that Mayor Johnson didn't have a point in his London Evening Standard interview. So does Speaker Bercow. But the objects of their scorn have counter-points to make. If it was easy to locate a new London airport in crowded south-east England someone would have done it over the past 40 years of public agonising. Ditto kick-starting a flatlining economy. Everyone from Beijing to Berlin via Chicago is trying, but they're all stuck. Boris gets gold for his motor-mouth.</p> <p>As for Bercow he is often correct in his efforts to raise parliament's game. But his many enemies are also correct when they complain that he and his wife, Sally, don't know how to behave with dignity appropriate to high public office. The pair display grotesque egotism and are serial offenders. Bercow's World at One interview was toe-curling.</p> <p>Of course, there was no need for other media to make a fuss over their predictable ravings \u2013 the Guardian tucked away short reports sensibly on its inside pages. And what could be more predictable than Richard Branson crying \"foul\" after the government finally took his advice to be less risk-averse in the awarding of public contracts by handing his Virgin Rail franchise to rival FirstGroup.</p> <p>Who's right? It's impossible to say at this stage and even the rail experts disagree. But Branson, who has done very well at both feuding in public and liposuctioning taxpayers' money (Northern Rock is his latest target), is a notoriously bad loser, shamelessly milking the public's love of an underdog even though he's been an alpha male overdog for decades.</p> <p>Of course, these things are highly subjective. For years I've been amazed how reflexively fawning a press that Gore Vidal enjoyed in leftish, Yank-bashing quarters for his arrogant and increasingly off-target assaults upon the United States and all its works. So I was grateful to his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Christopher Hitchens (no wallflower himself), for the kicking he gave Vidal in 2010, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-late-christopher-hitchens-ive-no-wish-to-assassinate-vidals-character-but-8001300.html\" title=\"\">posthumously republished</a> this month after the old rogue died.</p> <p>Vidal had become a reactionary and a very familiar kind of American isolationist, Hitchens concluded. Which is not to say he wasn't a brilliant essayist and phrase-maker. That's the trouble with real talent, as biographers so often discover once they've drilled beneath the hagiography. Evelyn Waugh may have been a bit of a shit, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene OM\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a> a very difficult customer, but they wrote some novels that will last.</p> <p>In any case, good people can be annoying too. I am afraid I have ceased to read interviews with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_Lawrence\" title=\"\">Doreen Lawrence</a>. She suffered a grievous loss in the murder of her son Stephen at that bus stop in 1993 \u2013 he was just a few days older than one of my children, now 37 \u2013 and has campaigned gallantly for justice ever since, rightly honoured at the Olympic opening ceremony. But I feel I now know what she has to say.</p> <p>Today's other headline junkie is a very different case. The government of distant Ecuador was placed in an awkward position when Julian Assange, the Wikileaks champion, sought political asylum in its London embassy. Overnight it has worked itself up into a state over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum\" title=\"\">a letter from the Foreign Office</a> which points out that the 1987 Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act may \u2013 may, since the legal point is disputed \u2013 allow the Metropolitan police to arrest Assange inside the modest Knightsbridge premises if William Hague unilaterally chooses to end its diplomatic status.</p> <p>\"Britain threatens to seize Assange\" is the Times headline on Thursday, the Guardian is sensibly more precise in saying that's how Quito chose to interpret the reminder as it geared up to announce its decision on whether to grant Assange's request. It sounded like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/video/2012/aug/16/ecuador-julian-assange-threats-britain-video\" title=\"\">a bogus over-reaction</a> and a distraction worthy of a Branson.</p> <p>The legislative background is understandable. Back in the 80s, so a lawyer explained on air this morning, the Iranian embassy had been seized, as had the Cambodian one by squatters. And PC Yvonne Fletcher had been murdered by a diplomat from inside Libya's People's Bureau in central London. Margaret Thatcher, no less, had to let him go.</p> <p>But the 1987 act \u2013 passed in haste just before a general election - was designed to rectify problems of terrorism, not extradition. Experienced and retired diplomats are saying it would be unwise to use it to collar Assange. Not that the FCO said it would, only that it had the power to do so. Presumably the government of President Rafael Correa knows it would have a problem getting its VIP guest to Heathrow and out of the country anyway.</p> <p>The real problem for supporters of Julian Assange is that they want to believe in him, as they did in his publications of those WikiLeaks cables allegedly leaked by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Manning\" title=\"\">Bradley Manning</a>, the American soldier now facing a fearsome prison sentence for numerous offences. But what people do \u2013 whether it's as writers or as political activists \u2013 is not always matched by who they are as private individuals.</p> <p>So the Assange-ites have been placed in the awkward position of claiming that their man is a persecuted journalist (he's not, he's an activist) upholding free speech who fears that, if he goes to Sweden to fight those allegations of sexual misconduct, he will be whisked off to an American jail with a death penalty hanging over him. Ecuador, whose government does lock up uppity hacks, is deemed a better bet.</p> <p>It's a big ask which requires people who might otherwise fiercely defend the rights of women not to suffer sexual abuse without redress to dismiss the charges made by his Swedish accusers. Tricky stuff, which is why it may be better for Assange to take his chance in a court inside one of the most reputable countries in the world, its due process well able to provide justice and stand up to any arm-twisting from the US attorney general's office. Better than us, did I hear you whisper.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Julian Assange joins Boris, Bercow and Branson on my silly season list. Mind you, it's not all silly season gloom and doom. Have you been following Gillian and Adrian Bayforth, the couple from Haverhill in Suffolk, who won \u00a3148m on the lottery? They seem a very grounded couple and determined to stay that way. Yesterday they flew off on a holiday break, by easyJet from Stanstead to a caravan park in Angus where Mrs B's parents live. They plan to share their good fortune. Good for them. I could tolerate hearing more about the Bayfords. Not all Bs are B for B******s.</p>",

Those selected will then take their place in a film that examines the life of \"two Hollywood celebrities\". The project is being overseen by producers Vince Jolivette and Miles Levy \u2013 Franco's partners in his Rabbit Bandini production company.</p> <p>Franco and Lohan worked briefly together on the 2006 comedy The Holiday and once discussed collaborating with the photographer Terry Richardson on a book of \"explicit\" erotica. Following three stints in rehab and a conviction for stealing a necklace, Lohan is currently on probation and is shooting a role in The Canyons, an independent thriller by Paul Schrader. Last year the 26-year-old actor told the New York Post that she and Franco are \"like best friends. We're hanging out together\".</p> <p>Franco, 34, rose to fame courtesy of his role as Harry Osborn in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and went on to win plaudits for his performances in Milk, Howl and 127 Hours. He is also a multimedia artist, has published a collection of short stories and teaches classes at New York University. His forthcoming projects include roles in Raimi's Oz: The Great and Powerful, a $200m prequel to The Wizard of Oz, and Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers.</p> <p>For those unable to wait to see Franco's film about Franco, fear not.

  "<p>There's a reason why we should admire the ad men of the 1950s. They managed to pull off the trick of making smoking, something fundamentally damaging and disgusting, appear both glamorous and gratifying. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1956101?dopt=Abstract\" title=\"\">According to an American Medical Association report</a>, by the mid-80s even five- and six-year-olds were better at recognising Joe Camel, the mascot of the Camel brand, than they were Mickey Mouse or Barbie.</p> <p>Today over 100,000 people die every year from smoking-related diseases in the UK alone \u2013 so we can say with confidence that the ad men did a damn fine job.</p> <p>After all that hard work, how frustrating for the Don Drapers of this world that pesky governments and health-conscious pressure groups are trying to blot out the deep allure of smoking forever. Most recently, Australia's highest court has tried to kettle the slow-death smoke parade by giving the green light for an olive revolution in the world of cigarette branding \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/tobacco-plain-packaging-australia-court?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">forcing tobacco companies to remove anything that might hint at a brand identity</a>, making them instead plump for generic olive-coloured packaging with pictures of cancer-riddled mouths and blinded eyeballs thrown in for good measure.</p> <p>But you know that's going to backfire, right? In an age where companies use social media to make \"friends\" with everyone under the sun and consumer loyalty can no longer be bought through traditional top-down, shouty shouty means, de-branding <em>is</em> branding. This is an age where the 90s culture-jamming strategies of Adbusters and No Logo, originally designed to subvert the power of mainstream advertising, have now been gracelessly co-opted and absorbed by \u2026 mainstream advertising. Olive green packaging? It's minimal, man. Puss-filled cancer eyeballs? Terror is so in right now.</p> <p>The trend for the absorption of transgressive pursuits by corporate forces is nothing new. You might even say it has always been the bedrock of late capitalist culture industries. In 1973, JG Ballard's satire Crash, a story about people who get sexual kicks out of multi-car pile-ups, was so shocking that one publisher famously declared Ballard \"beyond psychiatric help\". But by the 90s, Ballard's imagery, designed to warn us of the ever-closing gap between, and crude intermingling of, desire and technological innovations, had been neatly appropriated by Diesel to sell jeans. They ran a billboard featuring beautiful dead models strewn across a tableau of multiple car-crashes. Call my psychiatrist, I'm horny.</p> <p>The tobacco guys are up in arms about the new law, claiming it's an infringement of their intellectual property rights and threaten lots of <a href=\"http://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__3mnfen.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO8X73XG?opendocument&amp;SKN=1\" title=\"\">\"unintended consequences in years to come\".</a> But if they just chilled out for a moment they'd realise that those unintended consequences might unwittingly come through as the ultimate free upgrade. The days of the kitschy Marlboro cowboy are long gone, and anything minimalist that makes your product look more like a MacBook can only be a bonus.</p> <p>People have been slowly trained not to listen to big slogan messages any more; consumer brand advocacy is consolidated through bottom-level peer consensus. Rather than damaging sales, all it's going to take is a handful of smug hipsters blogging about the sleek \"olive greens\" they've been smoking as an ironic middle finger to the tobacco corporations they don't want to believe control them, and suddenly you've got yourselves a highly marketable people power movement.</p> <p>Which, my tobacco friends, will sadly result in nothing but more cigarette dollars for the big shots and more cancer deaths for the rest of us.</p>",

  "<p>There are three things about crowdfunding you need to know. The first is a fact: the US-based crowdfunding website Kickstarter recently announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/10/kickstarter-open-uk\" title=\"\">it would be accepting UK-based projects</a> from the autumn. The second is a rather mind blowing prediction: that same site, Kickstarter, has predicted that it will outfund the National Endowment for the Arts in America, by raising $150m in the coming year.</p> <p>For those that still need proof that crowdfunding has developed from a digital quirk into a powerful finance model, then take a look at <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats\" title=\"\">Kickstarter's recently published stats page</a>. And that third thing I mentioned? It's not about funding, but how crowdfunding is changing culture itself.</p> <p>When crowdfunding first popped up, I was intrigued; it had an obvious, zeitgeisty importance, and not because it represented a technological advance or even because digital fundraising was a new idea. Talk to any savvy fundraiser and they will inform you the Royal Albert Hall was essentially crowdfunded and say: \"Was that so very different from 'donate now' buttons?\"</p> <p>Ah, those buttons \u2013 pure pixelated hope if ever there was. The truth is, crowdfunding is radically different. Why? It has piggybacked on a confluence of technologies and social change, becoming nothing less than a financial harness for the digital collective. It's new because it gets that hard to define but 'internety' thing: a mass yet casual desire to innovate, take control and (most internety of all) have fun doing it.</p> <p>No longer is online giving all about brain tumours and doing wheezy laps of Hyde Park dressed as endangered species. Charity has been unharnessed from tragedy and uncoupled from institution \u2013 it has become upbeat. Set aside the whole 'globalised collective' aspect and fun really is the defining aspect of crowdfunding.</p> <p>You wonder if po-faced art will take a backseat to a movement that seems happy to fund a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/18/dinosaur-hunters-congo-expedition_n_1525800.html\" title=\"\">dinosaur hunt</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/projecthexapod/stompy-the-giant-rideable-walking-robot-0\" title=\"\">giant rideable spider robot</a> and a <a href=\"http://spacehive.com/head\" title=\"\">papier mache replica of the Queen strapped to a barge</a>. Lurking behind these madcap examples are real projects of interest. The internet clearly loves the wacky and instantly 'gettable' \u2013 will the serious suffer a terminal demotion?</p> <p>From the moment <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/imaginationstation/detroit-needs-a-statue-of-robocop\" title=\"\">this infamous statue of Robocop</a> got funded you knew the internet's sense of humour was going to have a say. Consider that dinosaur hunt: is it possible that a useful scientific trip for students knew a straight bat would fail and had the digital smarts to rebrand?</p> <p>And will art have to get wacky to get funded? Productions of the Cherry Orchard might be wise to include the odd piece of flying taxidermy, following the lead of the 'artist' who responded to the web's demands by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jun/05/catcopter-dutch-artist-amsterdam-video\" title=\"\">creating the Catcopter</a>. Behold a dead cat that flies. This piece might actually work on two levels, being both mercenarily viral and a self-embodied comment on internet culture.</p> <p>The tweedier sections of society and many artists will no doubt feel a certain unease with all this but my feeling is that drawing out the fun to get your art or science project funded is no bad thing. Fun and happiness are deeply underrated as productivity catalysts.</p> <p>Where else is crowdfunding going? Kickstarter has already blogged about <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/24-hours\" title=\"\">local government interest</a>. Soon it will announce that New York will have its own curated page backing projects that benefit the city \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/pages/portland\" title=\"\">Portland already has one</a>. This natural step into civic crowdfunding, where local citizens raise digital funds to improve public space, strikes me as a terrific development. But it throws up all sorts of issues around the nature of funding versus taxation, as highlighted by <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/08/10/how-do-we-make-civic-crowdfunding-awesome/\" title=\"\">blogger Ethan Zuckerman</a>.</p> <p>And of course, civic crowdfunding isn't all about Kickstarter. The British site Spacehive has been <a href=\"http://spacehive.com/\" title=\"\">at it for a while</a>. It deserves mention for two things. Firstly the potential of crowdfunding for cultural dissent and political protest. Was the alternative Jubilee Queen's head likely to get funded by Arts Council England? It seems unlikely with vested interests in play.</p> <p>Spacehive's second feat of note was funding the Glyncoch Community Centre. <a href=\"http://spacehive.com/GlyncochCC\" title=\"\">Take a look at the page</a> and witness the funders involved. As well as public donations, the project received the lion's share of capital from the local council and corporates like Tescos and Deloitte. To my knowledge, this is the first modern example of what could become the new 'tripod' funding model: crowd, government and brands creating capital builds together.</p> <p>At a time when business and government desperately need a new covenant with society, this is significant. Consider a controversial state-funded project like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2011/nov/09/arts-funding-museums\" title=\"\">the Public arts centre in West Bromwich</a>. Had the Public been partially crowdfunded, perhaps the bad feeling that marked its opening would have been deflected by the community's prior online connection.</p> <p>And once you create a building, what about long term sustainability? This seems to be where the crowdfunding model falls down. Could it ever move from funding one-hit wonders to a subscription model? My instinct is no, although there are examples of repeat crowdfunded festivals like Peckham's <a href=\"http://boldtendencies.com/about/\" title=\"\">Bold Tendencies</a>.</p> <p>Eternal crowdfunding campaigns seem waring. Then again any kind of marketing or grant application is tough, and <a href=\"http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/2012/02/trustfunding/\" title=\"\">as blogger Chris Unitt points out,</a> crowdfunding encourages arts venues to focus on audience rather than their local funding rep. No bad thing surely.</p> <p>That covers the changes in funding. How about that third thing I mentioned? Hold onto your hats and come back tomorrow. This is where it gets interesting.</p> <p><em>Patrick Hussey is digital campaigns manager at </em><a href=\"http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Arts &amp; Business</em></a><em> \u2013 follow A&amp;B on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/arts_business\" title=\"\"><em>@arts_business</em></a><em> and Patrick </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickRiot\" title=\"\"><em>@PatrickRiot</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The latest twist in the Julian Assange case, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live\" title=\"\">as we await Ecuador's decision on granting him asylum</a> (a decision which would not, <a href=\"http://www.headoflegal.com/2012/06/26/julian-assange-can-he-get-out-of-this/#comment-100873\" title=\"\">as I've written before</a>, in itself allow protection from arrest if he steps outside the embassy), is that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/235852216982974464\" title=\"\">people are wondering</a> whether the UK can simply strip the embassy of its diplomatic status, so allowing police officers to enter it.</p> <p>It seems the British embassy in Quito <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/story/2012-06-19/assange-seeks-political-asylum/\" title=\"\">has written to the Ecuadorian government</a> (hat tip to <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/story/2012-06-19/assange-seeks-political-asylum/\" title=\"\">@JasonLeopold</a>) saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy.</p> <p>\"We sincerely hope that we do not reach that point, but if you are not capable of resolving this matter of Mr Assange's presence in your premises, this is an open option for us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/46/section/1\" title=\"\">1987 Act</a> does indeed give ministers a power to withdraw recognition from diplomatic premises. Section 1(3) <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/46/section/1\" title=\"\">says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In no case is land to be regarded as a state's diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law unless it has been so accepted or the secretary of state has given that state consent under this section in relation to it; and if \u2014 <br>(a) a state ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post; or <br>(b) the secretary of state withdraws his acceptance or consent in relation to land, <br>it thereupon ceases to be diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of all enactments and rules of law.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On the face of it, then, the secretary of state (in practice a foreign office minister) could now simply withdraw consent, and with one bound, police would be free to make an arrest.</p> <p>But it's not quite as simple as that. You'll note that section 1(4) says</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The secretary of state shall only give or withdraw consent or withdraw acceptance if he is satisfied that to do so is permissible under international law,\"</p> </blockquote> <p>and that according to section 1(5), in deciding whether to withdraw consent, the minister:</p> <blockquote> <p>\" \u2026 shall have regard to all material considerations, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of this subsection \u2014<br>(a) to the safety of the public;<br>(b) to national security; and<br>(c) to town and country planning.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The \"compliance with international law\" requirement may present a problem, since <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/372400-vienna-convention-on-diplomatic-relations.html\" title=\"\">article 21 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> requires the UK to facilitate the acquisition by Ecuador of premises necessary for its mission, or assist it in obtaining accommodation. It's not obvious this allows the UK to just de-recognise the current premises without helping arrange something new.</p> <p>Section 1(5) is interesting because, in spite of the way the drafting clearly intends to preserve ministers' ability to take account of anything they think relevant, I've no doubt lawyers for Ecuador could argue that the list of three particular concerns colours the scope of ministers' considerations, the result being that only some particular difficulty relating to safety or to the premises themselves could justify withdrawal.</p> <p>More importantly, they could argue that Assange's presence in the embassy and Ecuador's conduct in sheltering him is not a material consideration; and that since that clearly lay behind the withdrawal, ministers would in deciding to withdraw consent, have taken into account an irrelevant factor.</p> <p>In addition, there'd be a potentially strong argument to be made that ministers had exercised their power for an improper purpose not intended by parliament when it enacted the 1987 legislation \u2013 their desire to arrest Julian Assange.</p> <p>Ecuador could judicially review any proposed withdrawal: I think the effect on Assange means this is the type of case in which, as Lord Sumption <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:UTaPeLlNEeEJ:www.supremecourt.gov.uk/docs/speech_120514.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgnkNCdbcQYeHaZ0wwD-ZbVVAoH2OZZ1KCr6TTwwNW3FpdHk0daasauVVNduS8dwyWEDc1SREPrZWSFlBXRGko05fSKKPK6Ofi9YhQ5A-RiN0be-xm79G1LFni9xrYTbI_rGMkb&amp;sig=AHIEtbSZEaffk6KOU2Ju-BJoUfiInYIN2w\" title=\"\">explained in a recent speech</a>, the courts would consider intervening in a foreign policy decision. Perhaps Assange could obtain an injunction on judicial review, preventing any arrest pending the outcome of proceedings. Of course, if the government successfully fought off that judicial review, the arrest could go ahead. But I don't think a defence would be easy, and at the very least, a judicial review would create further delay \u2013 which probably suits Assange fairly well. I'm not sure giving him a hook to hang one on would be the best tactical move for the government.</p> <p>The Quito letter from the UK to Ecuador went on apparently to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna Convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If I were advising the government, I think I'd say that, if ministers are determined to allow the arrest of Assange, it might be better simply to cut off diplomatic relations with Ecuador, send the ambassador home, close the embassy and arrest Assange after that. Ending diplomatic relations is the major sort of foreign affairs decision I doubt the courts would interfere with. But that'd be a major diplomatic call.</p> <p>\u2022 This piece first appeared on Carl Gardner's blog, <a href=\"http://www.headoflegal.com/\" title=\"\">Head of Legal</a>.

For people like Omar, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/aug/16/somali-refugee-sweden-video\" title=\"\">the Somali refugee featured in Rain is Beautiful</a>, a new government in Mogadishu is unlikely to mean much as most of the country will continue to be plagued by insecurity long after the government has assumed power.</p> <p>Many of the estimated 5,000 people living in Tunisia's Choucha refugee camp and Egypt's Saloum camp are, like Omar, refugees two times over. Having fled persecution in their country of origin \u2013 be it Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia or Sudan, to name a few \u2013 they travelled to Libya to find a safe haven and means to support themselves and the families they left behind.</p> <p>As the government of Muammar Gaddafi fell, many migrants became victims of xenophobic attacks, and again sought refuge in these makeshift camps. Despite new authorities in Libya, their problems have not ended; the Choucha camp remains insecure, and violence involving local residents, refugees, and security forces has occurred. In May 2011, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/25/libya-refugees-gaddafi-regime-attacked\" title=\"\">a large part of the camp burned to the ground</a>.</p> <p>With no possibility of making a life in Libya, returning safely to their home country, or settling in Tunisia or Egypt, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/16/campaign-refugee-resettlement-europe\" title=\"\">the refugees look to Europe for safe haven</a>. But most European countries are not interested in taking them in. After <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/02/refugees-feared-drowned-tunisian-coast\" title=\"\">risking their lives</a> by boarding small boats to sail towards Europe, many end up in Malta, where they are held in detention; a Human Rights Watch report last month called on Malta to review its \"<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/malta0712ForUpload.pdf\" title=\"\">arbitrary detention policy</a>\". Similarly, Greece last week rounded up more than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/07/greece-crackdown-illegal-immigrants-arrest\" title=\"\">7,000 foreigners presumed to be illegal migrants</a>.</p> <p>These countries are among the most common entry points for refugees and economic migrants (many people are both), and justify their actions by pointing to the disproportionate burden they bear compared with countries in northern Europe that \u2013 because of their geography and the sophistication of their border control bureaucracies \u2013 are harder for asylum seekers and migrants to reach.</p> <p>EU legislation known as the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33153_en.htm\" title=\"\">Dublin II regulation</a> stipulates that asylum applications must be processed in the first country where an individual arrives. This provides a justification for other European countries to refuse to engage in burden sharing. There is little political will within the EU to revisit this regulation, despite evidence that it encourages unfair treatment of asylum seekers and other migrants in these entry-point countries.</p> <p>UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has called on European countries to resettle 2,000 of the total caseload of 5,000 refugees in Tunisia and Egypt (the US has agreed to accept 3,000). Fewer than 900 places have been offered by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. The UK has not offered to accept any of the refugees, despite the active role it played in supporting regime change in Libya.</p> <p>There is little public support for opening doors to those who have been further displaced as a result of the Arab spring. The dismal state of the EU economy has helped to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment, based on the widespread belief that social services will be unduly stretched and jobs taken from unemployed nationals. In addition, many feel that human rights obligations, which EU countries are legally required to uphold, are overgenerous.</p> <p>\"Double-refugees\" and migrants-turned-refugees in Tunisia are among those who have suffered most from the Arab spring. What has emerged in Tunisia and Egypt is a protection vacuum, with the large numbers of refugees trapped in camps likely to remain there indefinitely.</p> <p>Without options for <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/refugees-and-migrants/resettlement\" title=\"\">safe resettlement</a>, more people will defy the grim odds and try to enter Europe illegally by sea. Many will perish on the journey; at least 1,500 died this way last year. Those who succeed in reaching a safe shore may find themselves locked up for months or years before being accepted somewhere or deported. European governments and the EU can and should do more to help the inadvertent victims of the Arab spring, expanding resettlement for Somalis and other double refugees, and offering them the security that many have lacked for years.</p>",

Next, a naked man crowned in gold kisses a great big snake. If you look very closely, you may detect an extremely subtle hint of homoeroticism here. </p> <p>So, was Edward II gay? It's difficult to prove who had sex with whom in history unless children were produced, but there is no doubt that the king and Gaveston were at least in an intense emotional relationship. At other times, Edward was thought to be involved with other men, and must have dallied with at least one (unknown) woman outside his marriage \u2013 he acknowledged a bastard son, Adam FitzRoy. Other British monarchs who had intimate relationships with same-sex favourites include James I, William III, Mary II and Anne.</p> <h2>Children</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394784559\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/16/1345106477709/Joby-Grabner-and-Tilda-Sw-004.jpg\" alt=\"Joby Grabner and Tilda Swinton in Edward II\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joby Grabner and Tilda Swinton in Edward II Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> England's nobles are irritated by Gaveston's influence on the king. Edward's wife, Queen Isabella (Tilda Swinton), allies both politically and romantically with Roger Mortimer (Nigel Terry). Her young son, the future Edward III, is at the centre of events; but fortunately this film neither buys into the <a href=\"http://edwardthesecond.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/edward-ii-and-his-children-and-why.html\">tiresome historical myth that he was fathered by Mortimer</a>, nor the ludicrous Braveheart myth that he was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jul/30/3\">fathered by William Wallace</a>.</p> <h2>Anachronism</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394784560\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/16/1345106762795/Tilda-Swinton-in-Edward-I-004.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton in Edward II\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton in Edward II Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The film is based on <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20288/pg20288.html\">Christopher Marlowe's 1593 play</a>, which is unusual for its time in openly portraying a gay relationship. Jarman's version mixes up historical and modern costumes. When the king reluctantly exiles Gaveston, Annie Lennox turns up to sing Cole Porter's 1944 song Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye. Edward's army is transformed into a group of gay rights protesters, waving placards that say: \"Get your filthy hands off our bodies.\" These anachronisms needn't upset the historical viewer: it's clear that Jarman is making a deliberate and valid point about the oppression of gay people throughout history. But the film's focus on the homophobia as the main factor in Edward II's downfall is open to dispute. In real life, England had been stricken by civil war, rebellions and famine throughout his reign, and he had lost most of Scotland to Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn. Whether or not he was a queen, Edward II just didn't cut it as a king.</p> <h2>Violence</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394784561\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/16/1345106654386/Steven-Waddington-in-Edwa-004.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Waddington in Edward II\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Waddington in Edward II Photograph: THE RONALD GRANT ARCHIVE</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: THE RONALD GRANT ARCHIVE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In the film, Gaveston is garrotted by a modern policeman with a baton. In real life, he was abducted and beheaded by a consortium of earls. The king moves on to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Despenser_the_Younger\">Hugh Despenser the Younger</a>, known in Marlowe's play and Jarman's film as Spencer. Despenser was destined for an even stickier end than Gaveston. According to one account, he was sent up a ladder and publicly castrated while still alive. Whether or not that happened, he was drawn, then hanged, then beheaded, then quartered and distributed in bits around England. The film's Spencer is merely strangled by Mortimer. </p> <h2>Death</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394784562\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/16/1345106557472/Steven-Waddington-in-Edwa-004.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Waddington in Edward II\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Waddington in Edward II Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Edward II is forced to abdicate. \"My daily diet is heart-breaking sobs,\" says the former king, \"that almost rent the closet of my heart.\" Though Jarman has altered some of Marlowe's lines to enhance the gay theme, that one is original. Edward was imprisoned and probably murdered in 1327 (a few historians argue that he may have escaped into exile). He is widely believed to have been disembowelled with a red-hot poker, though some historians suggest suffocation was a more likely cause of death. The film shows the red-hot poker incident as a premonition experienced by the former king, but doesn't state it as fact. Top marks.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Edward II's fall was about more than his sexuality, but Jarman's use of that element of the historical story to reflect on modern homophobia makes for an intelligent and striking film.</p>",
  "<p>A horse gave an ear piercing squeal. The sound of hooves thundering on concrete was deafening in my ears. The smell of smoke clogged my nostrils as I strained my eyes to see into the fog. Alongside me, Maxi reared, her usually gentle eyes wide with fear. My hands were rubbed raw on the lead rein as I strained to hold onto her. I pulled the collar of my fleece up over my mouth and ran through the smoke, desperately dragging Maxi along with me through the flames.</p> <p>Coughing and spluttering, I burst through into the open air.</p> <p>\"Charlotte!\" A voice yelled. \"Thank goodness\". </p> <p>I looked around me and saw everyone from the stables crowded in the car park, safely away from the blazing inferno that our stables had become. My best friend Jodie raced over. </p> <p>\"We were really worried!\" she said, taking Maxi from me and tying her safely away from the fire. Nearly all of the horses were around too, some tied to bailing twine, others loose. I gave a hand and tied up some of them, gently soothing them.</p> <p>Someone began to call out names, checking all the people were there. I wondered why they didn't do one for the horses as well. </p> <p>\"You'll have to go to the doctors\" said Jodie. \"You will have inhaled loads of smoke!\"</p> <p>Flames licked around the stable building, destroying my favourite place to be. If the fire brigade didn't get here soon it would probably be a pile of ashes. \"Did someone call the fire brigade?\" I asked concernedly. I wanted there to be every chance that the building could be saved.</p> <p>Jodie nodded. \"They're on their way, along with the vet to check that all the horses are ok. It's scary, isn't it? I mean usually when you hear about a fire, it feels so far away, as if it could never happen to you, or anyone you knew.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, I know what you mean.\" I nodded. \"Is there anyone missing?\"</p> <p>\"No people, but they haven't checked the horses yet.\"</p> <p>\"Why not?\" I complained.</p> <p>\"Well, they seem to think all of them are around, tied up or loose\"</p> <p>I breathed a sigh of relief. At least pretty much everyone seemed to be safe, if a little shocked and scared. It could have been much, much worse. My eyes scanned the crowd of horses, checking they were all there. No. I looked again, searching more urgently this time.</p> <p>He wasn't there.</p> <p>\"Where's Jack?\" I called out. Nobody answered. Others began looking through the group, but I wasn't waiting around. He wasn't there, I knew. His distinctive strawberry roan coat would be easy enough to spot amongst all the bays and greys. \"I'm going to find him!\" I called.</p> <p>\"Charlotte! Wait!\" yelled Jodie desperately.</p> <p>I darted back into the burning building. The heat of the flames stung my eyes, causing me to cry out. My jacket caught on a flame, so I quickly discarded it into the fire, not thinking about that anymore. Listening carefully, for a while I heard no sound other than the voices of people back in the car park. In the smoke my eyes were useless. I hoped that Jack was in here, somewhere, otherwise I was risking my life for nothing; but more importantly, if he wasn't here, where was he? </p> <p>Suddenly, I heard something. I ran towards the sound of a pony screaming, the sound of my worst nightmares. I saw an outline through the smoke, hazy, but there. I reached out my hand and felt the comfort of Jack's velvety muzzle. He was trapped in his stable, terrified. He must think nobody cared. I quickly tried to undo the bolt, but it was complex and stiff. My fingers fumbled, slower with fear and pressure. Eventually the door clicked open. I grabbed a hold of Jack's head collar frantically. </p> <p>Turning to look back, I saw the entrance to the pony yard blocked by flames. A burning plank from one of the jumps in the arena had fallen across, blocking our path. My thoughts whirled. What should I do? Should I abandon Jack and search for another way out? Not that there were any obvious exits. I tried to think but the smoke clogged my lungs and I couldn't think straight. I was gasping for breath. Suddenly, I had an idea. It was madcap, stupid... but it might just work.</p> <p>I grabbed Jack's mane and pulled myself onto his broad back. This brought back memories. I hadn't ridden him for a long time, due to my ever increasing height. I wondered if this was going too far, what if I got us both killed? I tried to push my many doubts aside and gently dug my heels into Jack's side. He reared up in terror. I was almost unseated, but I managed to cling on. I stroked him, trying to soothe him for there was worse to come. Gently using the pressure of my legs I steered him towards the burning plank. I was so scared, and the feeling in my tummy was not butterflies, more like excitable frogs. This was no simple show jump, ready to fall with the slightest knock. It was a solid jump, and to make it worse, it was on fire. One mis-step here could kill us both. I knew I could never live with the death of my favourite pony on my conscience and gulped. I tried again to move him, giving gentle pressure with my legs. Jack burst into a canter, straight at the flames. He looked back at me, seemingly saying, <em>You really want me to do this?</em> I nodded, and then closed my eyes.</p> <p>I leant forward and grasped his mane. I felt his front hooves leave the ground, and then an awful pain in my right foot. It felt as if I had hundreds of hot coals piled on it. I clung on, but tears were in my eyes. </p> <p>Then we had landed with a jerk. Jack was favouring his right hock, and it seemed miles away through the smoke of the arena to the car park. I felt as if I had just conquered Mount Everest, only to find a new even bigger mountain the other side. I decided to dismount Jack, and I crumpled to the ground with a cry. He nudged me with his muzzle, begging me to go on, and I knew I couldn't give up. His life was in my hands. I knew I had pretty much broken every health and safety rule in the book, but hopefully when I got out I would be forgiven. If I got out.</p> <p>I hauled myself up and limped onwards, my eyes closed tight against the burning smoke and flames. Jack reared up again, and wrenched my arm. </p> <p>\"Owwwww\" I cried. He came back to earth, his eyes wide and scared. He looked as if he was apologising, but how would I know. How could I ever hope to see into the mind of this amazing creature? Even though it was only a few metres to the exit, the smoke and the flames and the pain made it look like a marathon. I looked down at my right foot, and instantly looked away. The sight made me feel physically ill and nauseous. I must be dreaming, it couldn't be that bad. Surely all this couldn't have really happened. </p> <p>Jack looked down at me, his eyes clouded with pain also. He was worse off than me. I rested my head gently on his neck. I wasn't sure whether I could go on. I thought of my family, and whether they knew what had happened now, whether they were waiting outside. Or maybe they were back at home, oblivious to the danger I was in.</p> <p>Suddenly I heard sirens. Finally! It must be the fire brigade. It had to be. I couldn't hold on any longer. I tried to keep going with Jack, honest I did, but I had no strength. I fell to the floor and began to close my eyes, exhausted with the fear and excitement of the last few hours. Everything went black. The next thing I knew I was being carried out of the building. I instantly looked about me.</p> <p>I asked the fire-fighter holding me, \"Where's Jack?\" He gave me a confused look. \"The horse?\" I said.</p> <p>\"Oh, he got taken to the vets. That was quite an adventure you had there!\"</p> <p>\"But he's ok?\"</p> <p>\"I think so, yeah.\"</p> <p>I gave a sigh of relief. \"He saved my life,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Really? That's amazing. How?\" exclaimed the fire-fighter. So I told him the story.</p> <p>\"You must be tired out. Can you stand do you think?\". I nodded. He put me down and I limped towards my friends.</p> <p>\"What on earth were you doing?!\" Jodie said.</p> <p>\"Well none of you were going to save him.\" Jodie looked guilty. \"The fire brigade would have come\"</p> <p>\"He might have been burnt to death by then!\" I said.</p> <p>\"Anyway, the main thing is you're safe\" said Jodie.</p> <p>\"What happened?\" asked Jess, another of my friends. So I told them everything that had happened, and how Jack, the small and unpopular pony, had saved my life. </p> <p>I hope in a way this would make Jack's life easier, as he was unpopular among most of the riders. They found him impossible to ride and grumpy, which I suppose he was, in a way. I had always loved him for his cheeky character. But he was the greatest horse on earth for saving me.</p> <p><strong>Are you a budding writer or poet? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your scribblings!</strong></p>",
  "<p>US presidential election campaigns are usually noteworthy for the dirt that candidates throw at each other, and <a href=\"http://www.scottishreview.net/AlanFisher8.shtml\">the latest one is running true to form.</a></p> <p>But how do reporters who are doing their level best to tell their readers the truth cope when candidates move from spouting (just about acceptable) spin to telling (unacceptable) lies?</p> <p>These problems are raised in a short piece in the New Republic by Alec MacGillis, <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106197/the-welfare-card-and-the-post-truth-campaign\">The welfare card and the post-truth campaign</a>.</p> <p>He tells of witnessing a campaign appearance in Ohio by Mitt Romney in which the Republican candidate told his audience:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I want you to know I heard something the other day that really surprised me...

We value work, our society which celebrates hard work, we look to a government to make it easier for jobs to be created and people to go to work. </p> <p>We do not look for a government that tries to find ways to provide for people who are not willing to work. And so I'm gonna put work back into welfare and make sure able-bodied people can get jobs.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Canvassing the crowd afterwards, MacGillis learned that Romney's anti-Obama welfare jibe was the favourite part of his address. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"One of the more depressing parts of the job of being a political reporter is watching an audience fully absorb a blatant and knowing lie. Which is, of course, what this is. Countless fact-checkers... have unequivocally rejected the assertion that Obama has ended the work requirement. </p> <p>His administration has instead granted more leeway to states, including several with Republican governors, to explore new ways to get people on to welfare into jobs.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As MacGillis notes, the welfare debate has been subject to rigorous fact-checking, and he cites <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/spin-and-counterspin-in-the-welfare-debate/2012/08/07/61bf03b6-e0e3-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_blog.html\">a Washington Post example</a> to prove his point. Yet Romney, his running mate Paul Ryan and Republican TV ads go on repeating the \"utterly unfounded\" attack on Obama's policy.</p> <p>Worse. Despite the fact-checking process that is supposed to inform its journalism, America's press is not confronting Romney about his falsehood. He is being allowed to get away with it.</p> <p>MacGillis's point is taken up <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/what-to-do-with-political-lies/261189/\">by Garance Franke-Ruta at The Atlantic</a>. She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Fact-checking was a great development in accountability journalism - but perhaps it's time for a new approach. It's no longer enough to outsource the fact-checking to the fact-checkers in a news environment where every story lives an independent life on the social web, and there's no guarantee the reader of any given report will ever see a bundled version of the news or the relevant fact-checking column, which could have been published months earlier. One-off fact-checking is no match for the repeated lie.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>She puts her finger on the real problem. Repeated lies. This is a familiar device employed by politicians (and British popular newspaper editors), and it is always difficult to counter.</p> <p>And there have been plenty of examples in the States. Franke-Ruta mentions one: Obama is a Muslim. And don't let's forget the crucial one about Saddam Husein being behind the 9/11 massacre.</p> <p>She advocates the insertion of key sentences, or even paragraphs, in every story in which the lie is retailed. On the other hand, she appears to concede that this may not change the minds of the majority.</p> <p>The problem is more acute in Britain because our newspapers do not have the kind of fact-checking common in the US press. Our papers are also unashamedly partisan, even advocating that \"freedom\" as a virtue.</p> <p>Then again, we do have plurality and diversity - for the moment at least - in our mainstream media. We check up on each other. There are also many credible online and social media critics. </p> <p>But lies still beat us. After all, we made war on Iraq because too many newspapers happily accepted the political lie that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was able to launch them within 45 minutes. </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://www.scottishreview.net/AlanFisher8.shtml\">Scottish Review</a>/<a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106197/the-welfare-card-and-the-post-truth-campaign\">The New Republic</a>/<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/spin-and-counterspin-in-the-welfare-debate/2012/08/07/61bf03b6-e0e3-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_blog.html\">Washington Post</a>/<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/what-to-do-with-political-lies/261189/\">The Atlantic</a></p>",
  "<p>There are upsides and downsides to trusting machines to make important decisions. The story of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2012/aug/07/nasa-curiosity-rover-mars-video\" title=\"\">Mars rover, Curiosity</a>, is a shining example of the former. Nasa's communications expert compared conversing with the 352-million-miles-away-from-home machine to awaiting for a call from an errant teenager. But there is a dark side too, and it largely springs from the assumption that our digital automata have automatically inherited our sense of decency.</p> <p>Companies pay for online programmes such as Google Adwords where they design ads and set keywords for their advertising campaigns. Google then matches these campaigns to online content, automatically inserting ads into pages on YouTube, which Google owns, and other affiliated websites. Matching text with text is fairly straightforward, but making comparisons in digital media is more complicated, and on occasion ads are displayed because of YouTube's Content ID system.</p> <p>Content ID depends on copyright holders uploading examples of their products to YouTube from which a comprehensive library of digital fingerprints is compiled. The system then compares uploaded videos against this library, flagging close matches as likely infringements of copyright. In theory, Content ID allows music labels and other copyright holders either to have copyright-infringing content removed, or reclaim some of their losses from illegal distribution by receiving a cut from the advertising revenue.</p> <p>Additionally, the revenue sharing part of Google Adsense allows YouTube members to also benefit from advertising: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_William_Johnson\" title=\"\">Ray William Johnson is the top ranking user on YouTube</a>, earning more than $1m of ad revenue in 12 months.</p> <p>In practice, the whole system's performance is less than ideal and shows the symptoms of lacking human discretion. In the three years since Content ID was introduced, it has often misidentified content or mismatched keywords, but the most odious outcome from this blind process is the association of product advertising with unrelated and undesirable content.</p> <p>In a previous article, I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/21/neo-nazis-money-youtube-advertising\" title=\"\">how corporate ads were appearing alongside hate content and neo-Nazi propaganda</a>. Google's excuse is that their quality control is overwhelmed by the volume of uploads, with 72 hours of video uploaded every minute, resulting in nearly 12 years of content uploaded every day. Their solution is to rely upon users of the website to flag content considered inappropriate, as a form of self-regulatory crowd-sourced control.</p> <p>But relying on users to report videos is not a sustainable way of moderating content and advertising on YouTube. It is out of control: the very same mechanism is also associating ads with other disturbing videos, often showing suicides, murders, and the aftermaths of violent deaths. The multimillion pound dating agency \"Cupid\", voted Scotland's fastest growing technology company in 2011, were unknowingly paying for their ads to be displayed alongside pornography, \"snuff\" movies and footage of suicides and accidental deaths. Inexplicably, ads for Zaggora Hotpants, a brand of bioceramic anti-cellulite slimming shorts, were being displayed alongside pro-BNP videos, soft porn and films of actual, often violent, deaths.</p> <p>One YouTube channel called \"Minus Thrash Show\" presenting videos of gory accidents and real suicides was recently closed down, but immediately reappeared, sidestepping its expulsion with a subtle renaming and has re-uploaded all its video content. It now broadcasts as \"Minus Thresh Show\" and has advertising associated with several of its videos: the UK government's <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/youngpeople/nationalcitizenservice/b0075357/national-citizen-service-prior-information-notice\" title=\"\">national citizen service</a>, pitched as a \"a life-changing experience for 16 and 17 year olds\", has its ads displayed next to this channel's footage of the aftermath of a traffic accident where the top of a man's skull has been crushed upon impact with the road surface. A decapitated body lies nearby, its head is several metres away. The only explanation provided by the Content ID system for bringing together these apparently disparate elements is a positive match in the video with a song by a \"blackened death metal\" band from Gdansk.</p> <p>Two questions arise from this situation: first, is it acceptable that this material is hosted by YouTube and should they and their revenue partners be profiting from its existence? Google announced revenues of $12.21bn (\u00a37.8bn) for the quarter ending 30 June 2012, an increase of 35% compared to the second quarter of 2011, $1.2bn of which comes directly from the UK. That they only paid \u00a36m in taxes against a \u00a32.6bn UK revenue last year is a separate issue. Second, should companies be paying for advertising with Content ID matching that is currently juxtaposing their brands with execrable content?</p> <p>I share the belief with Robert Levine, the former executive editor of Billboard magazine that, \"some people will scream that YouTube is a public space and therefore you can't give them any private liability because it's a freedom of speech issue. But it's not a public space \u2013 it's more like a mall than a park. It's a multibillion dollar company and it has to have some kind of corporate responsibility\".</p> <p>While great scientific breakthroughs are hitting the headlines, with the Higgs boson and Curiosity, there are also impressive advances in artificial intelligence. Autonomous moral agents and the moral Turing test will one day produce a machine that can at least emulate decency, and it could be the solution to this problem. Until that point, the responsibility is with Google and YouTube, to regain control of their machines and their greed, and not prioritise money over morals.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 August 2012. It originally referred to \"Adsense's Content ID system\" rather than YouTube's, and to Google Adsense matching campaigns to online content, rather than Google. It has also been updated with newer statistics on the amount of video uploaded to YouTube every minute (it has increased from 60 hours a minute to 72).</p>",
  "<p>How did nature manage to survive for the past 3bn years, with no landowners and gamekeepers to look after it? That's the question you might ask yourself after reading <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/12/why-claws-are-out-for-royal-society-for-protection-of-birds\" title=\"\">Magnus Linklater's article in the Observer magazine</a>, attacking the RSPB and suggesting that grouse moors, pheasant shoots and \"vermin\" control are necessary to protect the natural world.</p> <p>Linklater maintains that the RSPB \"has incurred the hostility of farmers, landowners and even the rural communities among whom it works\", through the fiendish practice of \"assisting the police in exposing landowners whom it accuses of wildlife crime\". It should spend less time criticising landowners for killing birds of prey and more time \"working with them as partners\". It has needlessly antagonised \"owners of grouse moors and pheasant shoots\". He claimed that the RSPB is obsessed by birds of prey and protects them at the expense of other species.</p> <p>His article contains so many inaccuracies that it's hard to know where to begin. But let me mention just a few.</p> <p>Linklater states that the RSPB's claims about Britain's birds of prey are challenged \"head on\" by \"the latest Breeding Birds survey, compiled by the British Trust for Ornithology, a science-based organisation.\"</p> <p>One slight problem. The <a href=\"http://www.bto.org/volunteer-surveys/bbs\" title=\"\">Breeding Birds survey</a> is jointly funded by the British Trust for Ornithology and, er, the RSPB. Far from challenging the RSPB's assertions, it is in fact their source.</p> <p>He maintains that \"golden eagles are flourishing\". Rubbish again. The official conservation body <a href=\"http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/commissioned_reports/Report%20No193.pdf\" title=\"\">Scottish Natural Heritage reports</a> that the golden eagle population is greatly suppressed. Why?</p> <blockquote> \"A number of lines of evidence indicated that illegal persecution of eagles, principally associated with grouse moor management in the central and eastern Highlands, is the most severe constraint on Scottish golden eagles.\" </blockquote> <p>He claims that on two moors owned by the RSPB \u2013 Lake Vyrnwy in Wales and Geltsdale in Cumberland \u2013 \"curlew, plover and other waders have all been in decline.\" I checked with the RSPB. Not only is his assertion plain wrong, but it turns out that the organisation supplied him, at his request, with the figures for these reserves. These show, for example, that in Geltsdale the number of golden plovers rose by 70% between 2000 and 2010, while curlew numbers doubled.</p> <p>Linklater creates the strong impression that the decline of songbirds in the United Kingdom is caused primarily by birds of prey. How, you might wonder, did they manage to survive and prosper when birds of prey were more abundant? And how could birds of prey consistently exceed their carrying capacity without a collapse in their numbers, leading to an increase in the population of the birds they eat? Has he never encountered the ecological principle that predator numbers are limited by the availability of prey?</p> <p>When I spoke to Linklater, he told me that he has spent a year researching this issue. I can only assume that he has spent a year engaging in confirmation bias: searching for or interpreting new information in a way that confirms one's preconceived opinions.</p> <p>But the biggest problem I have with his article is this: it made no mention of the fact that he has a 4,000-acre estate in Scotland. He is one of three trustees (the other two are his wife and their lawyer) of the Riemore Trust, which owns the Riemore estate near Dunkeld. He tells me that it used to hold grouse, but they have disappeared for reasons unknown. He now runs a pheasant shoot there, and employs a part-time gamekeeper.</p> <p>Should he not have declared this interest when writing a highly contentious article about landowning, farming and gamekeeping, and the alleged persecution by the RSPB of the \"owners of grouse moors and pheasant shoots\"? When I put this to him, he agreed that it might have been a good idea to mention it, but he hadn't thought of doing so.</p> <p>This, to me, touches on a wider problem with journalism. It claims to hold other people to account (it often does so capriciously, concentrating on the sins of the underclass and those who challenge wealth and power, rather than those of the billionaire class for whom most journalists work). But it is itself almost completely unaccountable. Few journalists provide references for their claims, so that readers can judge for themselves whether they are accurately representing the facts. Fewer still show where their own economic interests lie: whether or not, in other words, they are the disinterested commentators they purport to be.</p> <p>A year ago I tried to promote the idea of accountability by <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/registry-of-interests/\" title=\"\">publishing my own registry of interests</a>. Though several journalists have congratulated me on doing so, and one or two have told me it was a \"brave\" thing to do (by which, I assume, they mean stupid), no one \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 has yet copied it. (There are two people who were doing it already, but unfortunately they seldom write for any national papers). The profession to which I belong remains as unaccountable as ever.</p> <p>Magnus Linklater has been in this business for 40 years: he's no naif. But the impression I received when talking to him was that this is the first time anyone has asked. Accountability has no place in the culture of journalism.</p> <p>I would like to see this change. I would like to see editors insisting that journalists publish any relevant interests in or alongside the articles they write. Ideally I would like to see a mandatory register of journalists' interests established, like the mandatory register of MPs' interests. Only then we will know how much weight to give to their opinions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\" title=\"\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",

But this particular loris has a secret (which I won't ruin for you). You'll just have to read the book, which is no hardship as Alexis Deacon is one of the best illustrators working today. His drawings are so beautiful they make me want to weep. </p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781406324990\">There Are Cats in This Book by Viviane Schwarz</a></h2> <p>Ah! This book is such good fun. Viviane Schwarz's cats are bold and bright and very, very friendly. The cats in this book talk directly to the reader inviting us to help them turn pages and flaps, and generally get involved. </p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007228959\">Mog the Forgetful Cat by Judith Kerr</a></h2> <p>I think that I own the whole Mog series, right from my dog-eared 1975 edition of Mog the Forgetful Cat to 2002's Goodbye Mog (I'm so glad she lived to a ripe old age). I can't imagine any child growing up without Mog and the Thomas family in their life. Perhaps someone should pass a law? Anyway, Mog rules supreme when it comes to cat books. A \"truly remarkable cat!\"</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781856021012\">The Story of the Little Mole Who Knew it Was None of His Business by Werner Holzwarth and Wolf Erlbruch</a></h2> <p>This is the tale of a little mole who emerging from his hole one morning has something rather nasty land upon his head. The book is his quest to find out \"who has done the business on his head\". The illustrations are sketchy and quirky with rather beautiful hand drawn text but, best of all, this book is very, very funny. </p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007158447\">The Cat in the Hat by Dr Seuss</a></h2> <p>I'm a Dr Seuss fan. When my daughter was young I could easily sit and read 10 Dr Seuss's back to back. Not getting tripped up on the tongue twisters was a matter of some pride to me. We still quote a passage from The Cat in the Hat at each other regularly. \"It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how\" - and this book epitomises fun.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780230712553\">Ernest by Catherine Rayner</a></h2> <p>Ernest is the story of a moose who is so big that he can't fit inside the book. Poor Ernest \"squidges, squodges and squeezes\", but STILL can't fit in. The solution is very impressive! There is something beautifully soft and tactile about the illustrations in this book. If Ernest really can't fit in his book, I'm sure I could squeeze him into my house instead. I'd really like to stroke his nose it looks so velvety.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141500591\">Banana by Ed Vere</a></h2> <p>This book is brilliant. Two monkeys, one banana and very little text add up to a truly engaging book about sharing. Ed Vere uses bright colours and chunky drawings to play out this little drama to perfection. </p> <h2>8) <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846169496\">That Pesky Rat by Lauren Child</a></h2> <p>I've got a real soft spot for rats, and can identify with this street rat's desire to be someone's pet. There's something so endearing about him lying in his little crisp packet.</p> <h2>9) <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781862309982\">Rosie's Walk by Pat Hutchins</a></h2> <p>I can remember Rosie's Walk being read to me as a child, and it was one of the first books I bought for my daughter. Rosie the hen goes for a walk, oblivious to the (rather clumsy) fox hot on her tail feathers. Rosie arrives home safe and sound and none the wiser, but we've had lots of fun along the way. </p> <h2>10) Dog Blue by Polly Dunbar</h2> <p>I first saw this book when I was an illustration student and fell in love immediately. It tells the story of Bertie who loves the colour blue, and dreams of owning a blue dog. Polly Dunbar's illustrations are elegant and charming and although this book is simply drawn it is incredibly expressive.</p>",
  "<p>Have you ever felt less enthusiastic about the return of the football season? The summer has not been kind to the reputation of the national sport. England suffered another drab defeat on penalties at an international tournament; the Arsenal captain used his personal website to petition for a transfer; and the Chelsea captain was in court to defend a charge of racial abuse.</p> <p>The Olympic magic that has spread through the country in the past few weeks has been slow to affect our footballers.

Peaches and her collaborators are soliciting donations for Pussy Riot's legal defence fund and have also created an <a href=\"http://www.change.org/freepussyriot\" title=\"\">online petition</a>, which has attracted more than 100,000 signatures.</p> <p>\"The charges and punishments facing Maria, Nadezhda, and Yekaterina are nothing more than a political stunt by the Russian authorities and Russian Orthodox church to retain control over the Russian people and instill fear into the free-thinkers, political activists, and artists,\" they wrote. \"The world is watching, and we do not like what we see.\"</p> <p>Tolokonnikova, Alekhina and Samutsevich were arrested in March, after staging a minute-long \"punk prayer\" at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, calling for Putin's resignation. Charged with hooliganism, the trio now face up to seven years in prison. Amnesty International is among those who have lobbied for Pussy Riot's release, as well as musicians such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Franz Ferdinand, Bj\u00f6rk, Madonna, Pete Townshend and Pet Shop Boys.</p> <p>Last week, the English band Blood Red Shoes were ejected from a party at London's ICA for Russian Olympians after they dedicated a song to Pussy Riot. \"They pulled the plug on us\", said drummer <a href=\"http://www.music-news.com/shownews.asp?H=Blood-Red-Shoes-ejected-from-Russian-Olympic-party-for-Pussy-Riot-dedication&amp;nItemID=55552\" title=\"\">Steven Ansell</a>. \"We were then told to get out by a bunch of massive Russian security guards.\"</p>",
  "<p>To resit or not to resit? This is an important decision and not one to be rushed into on a wave of disappointment about missed grades.</p> <p>\"You need to weigh up very seriously whether you will improve your grades by retaking,\" says Mark Bramwell, associate director for sixth-form colleges at the Association of Colleges.</p> <p>Talk to your teachers or careers adviser about why your grades are lower than expected, which modules you fell down on and by how much. If you've missed a university offer by a substantial margin, you might want to consider finding a different course through Clearing, or embarking on a foundation degree as a route into higher education.</p> <p>Are you sufficiently self-disciplined to go back over last year's work? If you decide to retake as an external candidate, without attending any classes, you can usually register to do this at your present school or college.</p> <p>\"External candidates need focus\", says Ellie Skinner, youth adviser at the National Careers Service. \"Plan a revision timetable week by week, making sure not to overload yourself with too much information. Know what works for you (for instance, revising out loud, or using different types of coloured paper), and think about what you did in the modules where you did well.\"</p> <p><strong>Online courses</strong></p> <p>You can also sign up for an online A-level course. Make sure the course is accredited (check with the Open and Distance Learning Quality Council) and that it lines up with what you've already done. Alternatively, you might choose to start another A-level online from scratch.</p> <p>In many cases, you can go back to your school or college for a term to get classroomsupport and resit A-level modules in January&#xa0;(if available).</p> <p>It is also possible to join another institution for a term or more, to retake in January or June. Check the 14-19 Prospectus website (see below) to find a college in your area where this is possible.</p> <p>Robby Johansson, 22, got poor grades in his AS levels first time round and spent two years doing \"dead-end jobs\" before deciding to retake at a different FE college. With a part-time job in a coffee shop, he signed on in August 2011 at Oxford and Cherwell Valley College in Oxford, and was delighted to get an A in English in January. He is now awaiting results of May exams in psychology and sociology and considering applying to university.</p> <p>\"I feel I've grown up a lot,\" he says. \"I pay more attention in class now, I do homework more seriously and I do the revision. Postponing your plans like I have doesn't mean your life isn't going to work out: getting a good result is better than getting a quick result.\"</p> <p>For families who can afford it, a private tutorial college is another option. Charging \u00a37-8,000 a term for three or four subjects, Cherwell College, Oxford offers one-to-one tuition, small group seminars and supervised study periods.</p> <p>\"The student can't hide,\" explains Stephen Clarke, acting principal. \"Sat face to face with a tutor, they learn because that's what they're there for.\"</p> <h2>Useful links</h2> <p><strong>National Careers Service </strong>helpline 0800 100900 or <a href=\"http://direct.gov.uk/NationalCareersService\" title=\"\">online</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://aoc.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>Association of Colleges</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://odlqc.org.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>Open and Distance Learning Quality Council</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/Nfmh3m\" title=\"\"><strong>Direct.gov 14-19 prospectus</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cherwell-college.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cherwell college</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/iWARTt\" title=\"\"><strong>Graduate prospects app</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394788163\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/22/1337679637344/Guardian-students-sign-up-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian students sign up banner\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian students sign up banner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>No, this is not a manual \u2013 by which I mean that it's not a book that's meant to be read with one hand. Despite its pink wrapper and the cover photograph of a naked young man with a flap-happy wrist, it's a solemn pedagogical production, derived from an undergraduate course taught by <a href=\"http://www.lsa.umich.edu/english/people/profile.asp?ID=254\" title=\"\">Halperin</a>, who is WH Auden distinguished university professor of the theory and history of sexuality at an address somewhere in the American cornbelt. Out there on the dreary plains, Halperin instructs students who could be his grandsons in irony, archness, melodramatic flouncing, the worship of Judy Garland and all the other queeny foibles and fetishes that most of us thought had been discarded when gay men marched out of the closet and asserted their right to respect and acceptance. Imagine Lily Savage conducting an oral exam, or Gok Wan fabulously modelling a mortar board. Bobs, bangs and military buzzcuts probably feature in the curriculum: Halperin has an earnest interpretative interest in \"what a hairstyle is 'about'\".</p> <p>The course, when first offered, created a local scandal, because a state university was expending public money on what Halperin enticingly called \"an experiment in the very process of initiation\". Affronted legislators wondered what kind of homework was required of the inductees. I'm curious myself, since Halperin on one occasion addresses the reader of this book as \"darling\". He relished the outrage of the puritans: he was used to it, having been <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/activities/safe/cases/mit-wolff/wolff-settles-outcourt\" title=\"\">accused of sexual harassment</a> while teaching at MIT in the early 1990s. That charge was dropped, and MIT sent him off on study leave for a couple of years; his next academic appointment, however, was in faraway Australia, where he can't have made many friends if he imperialistically announced, as he does in his book, that \"being gay is like being American\" and presented himself as the proselytising agent of \"total, global queerness\". Now repatriated to the US, he is assiduously milking the fuss about his course, which has enabled him, as he reports with a hoot of triumph, to increase his lecture fee.</p> <p>Halperin's first efforts to profess \"gay male studies\" were half-cocked. He made the mistake of expecting his midwestern students to read books, which bored them; they spent his classes covering the attendance sheet he circulated with doodles of themselves in drag, preening under the hair-dryer in a beauty salon. Revamping the course as \"How to Be Gay\", Halperin eased the strain on their bubbly brains by dispensing with a bibliography and instead prescribing excerpts from a few campy movies. His book devotes literally hundreds of pages to the obsessive analysis of a catfight between Joan Crawford and her bitchy daughter in the film noir <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(film)\" title=\"\"><em>Mildred Pierce</em></a>, with footnotes on Faye Dunaway's maenadic impersonation of Crawford on the rampage with a coat-hanger in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082766/\" title=\"\"><em>Mommie Dearest</em></a><em> </em>and Sofia Coppola \u2013 the distinguished professor, incidentally, misspells her name \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-jp4hk7VIU\" title=\"\">lewdly mimicking both Crawford and Dunaway</a> in a music video for Sonic&#xa0;Youth.</p> <p>The abusive encounter between Crawford and Ann Blyth in <em>Mildred Pierce</em> is, for Halperin, a Freudian primal scene, an authoritative primer from which gay men can learn how to be ersatz women, suffering with grandiloquent flair while rolling their eyes and spitting epigrammatic put-downs at each other. I'm glad that he mostly stays away from literature (which, as he found, gave his students headaches), since he describes Melville's Christ-like Billy Budd as the apotheosis of rough trade, a pick-up whose naval pants obligingly unbutton in the rear, and his only reference to Auden, in whose honour the professorship he holds was endowed, refers to the old boy's quaint habit of referring to himself not as \"I\" but as \"Your mother\". Halperin is more at ease when enthusing over curiosities like <em>To the Last Man</em>, a porno western in which cowboys wearing very snug jeans gun down their bunkmates and are ineffectually reproved by a preacher who lisps \"I'm tired of getting blood on my dog collar\".</p> <p>If you can tune out Halperin's shrillness and grope though his pseudo-philosophical miasma (\"Every thing is a 'thing',\" he tells us at one point), you may be able to trace an argument I happen to consider reactionary and disreputable. By teaching the young to adore old-time divas like Crawford and Garland, Halperin hopes to persuade them that gayness is about culture not sex, about solitary, subjective taste not shared identity. In his nostalgia for the heyday of giddy effeminacy, he denounces the campaign for marriage rights as a concession to \"heteronormative\" society; political protests about discrimination are waved away by his silly insistence that \"camp is a form of resistance to power\" or his astonishing notion that maleness is a mode of \"terroristic surveillance and enforcement\", a symptom of the \"lethal dose of unironised masculine histrionics that the world has had to absorb since September 11, 2001\". This swishing makes me wonder whether al-Qaida's fanatics may have a point about the decadence of the west.</p> <p>Back in the 1960s, Susan Sontag \u2013 whose <a href=\"http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html\" title=\"\">Notes on Camp</a> articulated in a few fleet aphorisms most of what Halperin spends more than 500 pages paraphrasing \u2013 welcomed a new gay formalist style in criticism by declaring: \"In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.\"</p> <p>Having trudged through Halperin's tract, I have a proviso to add: what we definitely don't need is an academics of Eros.</p>",
  "<p>I'm not sure if I dare to share what I'm actually thinking about for fear of being of being labelled mad, sad or even dangerous, but let me take a risk and admit that I'm thinking about the future of democracy. Not democracy in some abstract sense, but democracy in terms of my children's lives: their safety and future, and the simple fact that, whether we like it or not, democratic politics shapes the world around us. </p> <p>If I'm completely honest, what I'm really thinking about is why so many people seem to have lost faith in political institutions, political processes and politicians. I'm not trying suggest that politics is perfect or that all politicians are angels, but the emergence, in the UK and most parts of the developed world, of huge numbers of 'disaffected democrats' worries me. </p> <p>It worries me because I've spent time in places where basic democratic rights and freedoms do not exist, where politics is still based on brutality and intimidation; countries best described as fear societies rather than free societies. Seen from this perspective, democratic politics suddenly seems to matter far more - and deliver far more - than many 'disaffected democrats' are willing or able to acknowledge. At a more basic, day-to-day level, I've never understood why so many people seem set on denying that a host of public goods \u2013 pensions, free secondary education, health care, sick pay, redundancy pay, clean water, the minimum wage, social housing, etc - bear any relationship to that tarnished activity called politics at all. </p> <p>More broadly, in the 50 years since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/bernard-crick\">Bernard Crick </a>wrote In Defence of Politics there has been a 17% increase in life expectancy worldwide. This increase has been most spectacular in the poorer nations of Asia, where it has reached 20%. \"The world is a much better place today than it was in 1990, or even in 1970,\" the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/\">United Nations Human Development Report</a> for 2010 concludes. \"Over the past 20 years many people around the world have experienced dramatic improvements in key aspects of their lives \u2026 they are healthier, more educated, wealthier and have more power to appoint and hold their leaders accountable than ever before\". </p> <p>Democratic politics is by no means perfect but let us not deny its benefits and achievements. </p> <p>A far braver (and some might say more foolish) man than I might even dare to suggest that vast sections of the public have become democratically decadent. Decadent in the sense that their expectations of what politics should deliver have become to high; and their sense of their own personal responsibilities to contribute to society have become too low. I'm personally quite glad that Barack Obama turned out not to be superman after all. Too many people sidestep their own individual responsibilities as citizens by looking for a superhero to take control. Obama's election still demonstrates the capacity of democratic politics to renew itself; to reconnect with sections of the political community that had effectively become disenfranchised, and to secure agreements on ambitious policies that many thought could never be achieved. Viewed in this way, I put it to you that maybe the fabric of democratic politics is not as threadbare as many think.</p> <p>What I'm really thinking is that we can do much worse than honour 'mere politics'. It's easy to carp from the sidelines and bemoan the failure of politics; far harder and riskier to step into the arena and attempt to display a little genius in the art of reconstruction. My concluding thought is therefore this: the 21st century will belong to those individuals, communities and countries who are willing to respond to the world as it changes; to modernize and adapt and see the loss of once-fixed reference points as an opportunity rather than a threat. </p> <p>Put slightly differently, the 21st century will deliver most to those who are able to rebuff the politics of pessimism and in its place cultivate a more buoyant and vibrant politics of optimism. But this transition will occur only if we are willing to ask some very hard questions about the balance between rights and responsibilities, about the meaning of democracy, and about the limits of politics.</p> <p><strong><br>Matthew Flinders is discussing whether we can trust politicians again with Dan Hinds this morning, and he will will be joined by Sir Menzies Campbell in the Rethinking Democracy debate on Thursday at 7pm</strong></p>",
  "<p>The flight is booked, the capsule wardrobe packed and you've worked out the fastest way to the airport. There's just one more thing to sort out: your holiday cash. Getting the best deal can mean spending less on commission and charges and more on holiday treats, so here's a guide to arranging your foreign currency.</p> <h2><strong>Buying cash</strong></h2> <p>Ordering currency online, which can be picked up at the airport, is cheaper than exchanging it at an airport bureau de change \u2013 the Post Office says more than \u00a321m is wasted annually on buying currency at the last minute at UK airports due to poor exchange rates and commission charges on lower-value transactions.</p> <p>When buying currency, remember that commission-free doesn't necessarily equate to the best deal, as fees are likely to have been loaded into the rate. Also, be wary of flat fees and minimum charges: the latter make it more expensive to change small amounts of money, while the former can offer good value if you are changing larger sums of money. Watch out for handling fees, too, which are normally about \u00a33 but can be higher.</p> <p>Also, your own bank or building society might have preferential rates for account holders.</p> <p>If you do end up buying currency over the counter, check if your debit card provider will charge an exchange fee. If so, you might want to withdraw cash and use that to pay for your travel money.</p> <p>Try MoneySavingExpert's <a href=\"http://www.Travelmoneymax.com\" title=\"\">Travelmoneymax.com</a> website to find the best online rate.</p> <h2><strong>Travellers' cheques</strong></h2> <p>These are a secure way of carrying your money abroad, because as long as you make a note of the cheque numbers you'll get a full refund if they are lost or stolen. However, the exchange rates are often poor and some come with high fees. Travelmoneymax found that for \u00a3100 you would get just \u20ac102 in euro travellers' cheques from Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>When cashing cheques abroad you are likely to face an additional charge (normally an extra couple of pounds), so try and take your cheques in larger amounts as it will cost the same to cash \u00a3100 as it will \u00a310.</p> <p>You can pre-order cheques in the same way you can cash, but travellers' cheques do not always come in denominations that exactly match how much you wish to spend.</p> <h2><strong>Pre-paid cards</strong></h2> <p>These are easy to use because you simply load them with funds before you go on holiday, then use the card to withdraw cash from ATMs or to make purchases. All the foreign exchange specialists now offer them, along with travel agents and banks. Even supermarkets offer pre-pay cards, although they tend to be Travelex cards stamped with the supermarket's logo.</p> <p>If you lose your pre-paid card you can cancel it or report it stolen, making it a reasonably safe way to carry money. But while some providers do not charge exchange fees, others will charge an initial set-up fee as well as fees on cash withdrawals and even top-up charges. Some pre-paid cards charge \"inactivity fees\", such as Ryanair's Cash Passport which slaps a \u00a32.50 monthly charge on users if they do not use the card for six months.</p> <p>You can buy specialist euro or dollar currency cards, which will be cheaper than using a debit card. The FairFX euro currency card special, for example, has <a href=\"http://www.fairfx.com/wizard/start/post#a_id=moneysupermarket-offer&amp;chan=moneysupermarket-cash\" title=\"\">no set-up fees if you apply via Moneysupermarket</a>, and charges \u20ac1.50 on international ATM withdrawals. It currently charges \u00a3104 for \u20ac130, plus a \u00a36 delivery charge. The <a href=\"http://www.mytravelcash.com/travel-money-products/euro-prepaid-credit-card.html?refcode=mytwstd0001&amp;offer=mtcgtd\" title=\"\">my TravelCash euro currency card</a> is free, has free international withdrawals and also offers 1% cashback on all purchases. It is currently charging \u00a3105 for \u20ac130.</p> <p>Some pre-paid cards will only allow you to top up face-to-face, while others give you the chance to top up on the phone or on the internet.</p> <h2><strong>Debit cards</strong></h2> <p>Many debit card providers add a fee of about \u00a31 for each purchase you make while on holiday, as well as fees of about \u00a32 each time you withdraw money from an ATM. The exchange rate you will get from your own bank on overseas purchases is also generally worse than if you shopped around for currency.</p> <p>For example, if you use a Barclays debit card overseas you will be hit with a 2.99% charge. On top of that, if you withdraw cash from an ATM you'll be charged 2% of the transaction (minimum charge \u00a31.50, maximum \u00a34.50), meaning \u00a3100 of euros will cost you about \u00a35. If you're using a cashpoint in a country that's not part of <a href=\"http://www.barclays.co.uk/Helpsupport/Usingcashmachinesabroad/P1242558955276\" title=\"Barclay's Gl;obal Alliance\">Barclays' \"Global Alliance\"</a> you'll also be charged a transaction fee over and above the foreign exchange charge.</p> <p>Nationwide no longer offers free overseas withdrawals for current account customers, but is fairly competitive with a 2% transaction charge on spending or withdrawals and a flat \u00a31 fee for using an overseas ATM.</p> <p>That leaves Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society's debit card, which still costs nothing to use overseas, and Metro Bank, which also allows fee-free purchases and withdrawals, though you have to open an account with the London-based bank in person to get the card.</p> <h2><strong>Credit cards</strong></h2> <p>In general, it's best to avoid using a credit card to withdraw cash abroad as you might at home: many providers will levy an exchange rate fee of up to 3%.</p> <p>Some cards offer 0% on purchases for up to 12 months, but you'll have to double-check you are not hit with a loading fee and make sure there are no restrictions on overseas purchases.</p> <p>The Post Office classic card is commission-free for use abroad and has a reasonable APR of 14.9%. There is an introductory offer for purchases of 0% a year fixed for three months, and an introductory offer for balance transfers of 0% per annum fixed for eight months. The Halifax clarity credit card also doesn't charge for overseas purchases.</p> <h2><strong>Watch out for sneaky overseas retailers</strong></h2> <p>Some merchants will offer to convert your bill into your home currency. This is known as \"dynamic currency conversion\" and will likely result in a higher exchange rate. Always check the bill before paying and make sure you are billed in the local currency.</p>",
  "<p>Are you one of the thousands of police officers suddenly without a job? Do you miss investigating serious crimes, knocking on doors, and doing nearly everything you did in your last job? Well then, you're in luck! Warwickshire police need <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/14/g4s-advertises-staff-police-crimes\" title=\"\">\"civilian investigators\"</a>, so apply through G4S! That's right, G4S will be providing staff to assist police in serious investigations, but it assures us that it won't be taking over \"core\" policing functions. Well, at least not yet.</p> <p>I'm not here to shame G4S for advertising these positions, because this is a problem brought by a government focused solely on the bottom line, and G4S is just meeting the needs of this newly created market. I'm sure it was happy to bid for the opportunity, and may have even suggested the idea, but in the end this tragedy is the result of a political agenda that is blind to the implications of turning emergency services into a for-profit enterprise.</p> <p>Clearly there is some room for the private sector to take on a support role in policing activities. Do you need a warranted officer to transport a prisoner or fix the cars? Probably not. However, this hiring effort \u2013 and several associated contracts G4S are participating in \u2013 is about cutting officers from the ranks and then hiring them back through a private company.</p> <p>When they return, they'll likely not have the same pay, pension benefits or work-related protections their unions have fought dearly for. What other reason is there to cut trusted officers who have sworn to uphold the law, and replace them with private employees of a multinational company? We must acknowledge that such cutbacks will most likely result in savings for the police service. For this government, that seems to be the only bottom line.</p> <p>Too often the coalition's logic misses the point that reforming a state doesn't mean you dismantle it. The neoliberal fetishism with private enterprise does not address the issues that go beyond money. Thankfully, even Phillip Hammond is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/g4s-olympic-effort-private-sector\" title=\"\">starting to question</a> if the private sector really is the right answer to many of the problems of government.</p> <p>The outlandish depictions of privately paid \"civilian investigators\" derailing the entire criminal justice system to protect their employer are hyperbolic at best, but we cannot ignore that something is lost when the people running the criminal justice system face even the slightest implication that they are not completely objective.</p> <p>If your reason for cutting current officers is that you think the private sector will provide better staff, then you should instead reform the current police service. Invest in training, increase accountability and improve their connections to the community they serve. Years of wildly fluctuating targets and measurements have left the police with disjointed goals, so we cannot be surprised if they seem a bit unable to cope at times. There is plenty of room to improve the UK policing, but we must also realise that when you start putting basic policing services out to tender, you remove what sanctity is left. I'm not worried about the capabilities of the individual civilian investigator, I'm worried about a police service that thinks about profit. The <a href=\"http://www.g4s.com/\" title=\"\">homepage for G4S</a> has its current stock price on it, and while I respect that because it's a private company in a capitalist system, I don't want that thinking invading my police service.</p> <p>Besides, haven't we learned anything from Robocop?</p>",
  "<p>This is a brilliant take on our classic nursery pudding, which I stumbled upon by quizzing the girls in my local Chinese supermarket (a great way of getting new ideas).

Tip into a large saucepan, add the coconut milk, lime zest and nutmeg and bring slowly to the boil. Turn the heat down as low as you can and place a lid on top. Simmer for about an hour, until most of the milk has been absorbed. Grate in the unrefined sugar and continue to heat for just long enough for this to dissolve. Taste to check the balance of sugar and lime, just as you would when you are seasoning a savoury dish. It should have a slightly nutty texture and be gently sweet. Serve with creme fraiche and sliced mango.</p> <p>\u2022 I have suggested serving this dish with creme fraiche, which is totally unorthodox \u2013 being French \u2013 but I really like the tart edge that it offers in contrast to the rich coconut milk.

  "<p>Where to spend the next three or four years of your life studying is not an easy decision to make, least of all when you've only got a few hours to weigh up all the information about courses, institutions and location. So it is vital to focus on the things that are important. And the most important thing, says absolutely everyone, is the course.</p> <p>Ella Dove, a student ambassador at Southampton University, studying languages, says: \"Although in the long run if you get a place from a good university it may help you get a job, if you're not interested in the subject it's a waste of time.\"</p> <p>Tim Sellars, science admissions manager at Liverpool John Moores University, says: \"Always go for what you enjoy, because it is a huge commitment and you don't want later to be thinking 'I don't want to be here'.\"</p> <p>But be prepared to compromise too. \"For us in science it is important for students to be realistic and a bit flexible,\" he says. For example, if you have three Cs you won't get a place on a pharmacy course at John Moores, but you might get on to pharmaceutical sciences, which could still lead to a pharmacy career. You may even be able to transfer to your preferred course if you perform well in your first year.</p> <p>You could also decide to do a foundation degree, which would mean another year of university \u2013 and of fees \u2013 but should give you a leg-up into the course you want.</p> <p>Then it's worth investigating how far modules on different but related courses overlap. An animal behaviour degree may share many modules with biology; an English language course with English literature. \"It is about understanding what each course involves, and looking at what your strengths are and which subjects you enjoy,\" says&#xa0;Sellars.</p> <h2><strong>Tables and teaching style</strong></h2> <p>Remember too that league tables and word-of-mouth reputations don't reveal the whole picture. Some prestigious courses are at universities low down in the general&#xa0;tables.</p> <p>Dove at Southhampton also advises looking in detail at how subjects are taught in terms of contact hours and structure.

  "<p>Most students end up having to work to supplement their income, but while a little less reliance on the overdraft can make for a better night's sleep, balancing full-time study with part-time employment can be tricky.</p> <p>While international students are prevented by law from working more than 20 hours a week, most universities set their own recommendations slightly lower \u2013 around 16 hours \u2013 to prevent students compromising their academic work. Katy Roberts, who graduated from the University of York this year, worked in pubs throughout her degree, finding it a vital line of support. \"My loan only just covered my rent,\" she says, \"so working part-time freed up some cash and sustained my shopping addiction!\" Having finished university without a credit card debt or overdraft, she's convinced it paid off.</p> <p><strong>Just say no</strong></p> <p>But she wasn't immune to the struggle of balancing a job and a degree, having to scale back her hours to just one evening a week during her finals. \"Never be made to feel guilty for not doing more than you can,\" she says.</p> <p>Bob Hughes, welfare officer at the University of York students' union, agrees, advising: \"If you're having difficulty managing work and study, talk to your academic supervisor about other sources of either academic or financial support.\" Try and stick to smaller contracts \u2013 you can't be required to work more hours than your contract states, so if you need to drop hours during exam time, it's better to be on a contract for eight hours a week rather than 16. Hughes also advises familiarising yourself with minimum wage, labour law and the tax system, to be sure you aren't being taken advantage of.</p> <p>The retail and service industries are usually a good bet. Steer clear of commission-based and \"marketing\" jobs \u2013 if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p> <p>Don't forget to look close by \u2013 universities always have openings in their bars, cafes and shops, as well as in administration, auditing, and even door security for events. These jobs are convenient and flexible, but for these reasons they're usually highly sought-after, so it's wise to hit the ground running and ask around as soon as you arrive.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/DG_177940\" title=\"\"><em>Pay and work rights</em></a></p>",

The excitement is palpable, as they stand on the brink of the best of times. They have so much going for them. There are nerves, lots of them, but they reassure themselves that everything will be all right. At the back of their minds, though, there is the fear that it could go horribly wrong.</p> <p>Two days before their season starts with a testing assignment at Newcastle United the fans look at the squad list and see only one established striker in Jermain Defoe. They know that Scott Parker, a talisman for much of last season, will not play until October at the earliest because of achilles surgery and another important midfielder, Sandro, has not yet trained under the new manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, due to international commitments with Brazil. And then there is Luka Modric, whose transfer saga has bubbled in the background for the second successive summer.</p> <p>When Villas-Boas was introduced as Harry Redknapp's successor on 11 July he spoke of the requirement to \"complete\" the squad. Jan Vertonghen and Gylfi Sigurdsson had been announced as encouraging early signings but there remained imbalances, particularly up front. The club's inability to address them quickly has not helped Villas-Boas's preparations and it has been easy to remember the beginning of last season, when late incoming business, injuries and Modric's state of mind made for a stuttering start.</p> <p>Villas-Boas has reason to be more nervous than most, although he has not shown it. He has presented a supremely bullish front, saying that Tottenham ought to be genuine title contenders from the outset and even aiming a pop at Roman Abramovich, his employer at Chelsea last season, for failing to \"put up to the things that he promised\". Not many people take on Abramovich. Villas-Boas must restore the damage to his reputation that was caused when Abramovich sacked him eight months into this Chelsea contract.</p> <p>The pressure on Villas-Boas will be intense, largely because Redknapp was dismissed by the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, after overseeing fourth-, fifth- and fourth-place Premier League finishes, which represented the club's most consistently impressive achievements since the halcyon days of the early 60s. The bold decision to sack Redknapp was tied up in the latter's desire to manage England and it was underpinned by a personality clash between manager and chairman.</p> <p>The bottom line, though, was that Levy felt Redknapp had taken the team as far as he could and that Villas-Boas is the better bet for the future. For Villas-Boas the margin for error would appear nonexistent. (As an aside, one of the great unanswered questions is whether Levy would have dismissed Redknapp if Chelsea had not won the European Cup and fourth place would have been enough to take Tottenham back into Europe's elite competition.)</p> <p>Levy's transfer dealings in the next two weeks or so will be vital but there is a confidence at the club that everything will be resolved to their satisfaction. The chairman always leaves things late, for better or for worse, although the delay in the permanent acquisition of Emmanuel Adebayor has not been his fault. He agreed a fee of \u00a35.5m with Manchester City weeks ago for the striker, who spent last season on loan at White Hart Lane, and Adebayor's personal terms have also been fixed. The problem has been between Adebayor and City over a huge termination-of-contract payment that the player maintains he is entitled to.</p> <p>Villas-Boas would like another striker and the club are in talks with Internacional over Leandro Dami\u00e3o, the Brazil No9, while they also have an interest in Fernando Llorente of Athletic Bilbao. In goal Villas-Boas would ideally like an upgrade on Brad Friedel but, as yet, Lyon's Hugo Lloris has proved too expensive. Julio Cesar of Internazionale would be a much cheaper alternative.</p> <p>It is unlikely that Modric, who has trained away from the first-team group, will again be denied his move, even if Levy has resolutely held out for \u00a340m from Real Madrid and the Spanish club have refused to go much higher than \u00a330m. Levy turned down a package worth \u00a340m last time out from Chelsea. The key difference this summer has been that Tottenham are prepared to sell. </p> <p>The club have raised about \u00a314m through the sales of Niko Kranjcar, Vedran Corluka and Steven Pienaar but they need the Modric money to make their final signings. Villas-Boas has tracked the Porto midfielder Jo\u00e3o Moutinho as Modric's possible replacement, while the club have seen a bid rejected by Rennes for Yann M'Vila. Porto's president, Pinto da Costa, would demand at least \u20ac30m (\u00a323.5m) for Moutinho and, like Levy, he is not a man to back down easily.</p> <p>Tottenham, as ever, are juggling many balls during the transfer window \u2013 they unsuccessfully bid \u20ac16m for Bologna's attacking midfielder Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, according to the player's agent \u2013 and the north London club are also open to moving on a section of their squad: Heurelho Gomes, William Gallas, S\u00e9bastien Bassong, David Bentley, Jermaine Jenas, Giovani dos Santos and even Rafael van der Vaart face uncertain futures. Tom Huddlestone has been left frustrated at his lack of pre-season minutes, after recovering from a long-term ankle injury.</p> <p>Villas-Boas wants to play his high-intensity pressing game, with an emphasis on slick passing and movement, and his back four would appear to have the requisite pace. Younes Kaboul is expected to partner Vertonghen in the centre, with Kyle Walker and Benoit Assou-Ekotto sure to relish their attacking responsibilities in the full-back positions. With Ledley King retired, the 20-year-old Steven Caulker has the opportunity to press his credentials.</p> <p>The captaincy is an interesting issue, with Villas-Boas yet to confirm who will take over from King. Michael Dawson is an obvious contender; he has done the honours in pre-season and he has the respect of the dressing-room. But is he a certain starter in the team?</p> <p>Parker is another option, even if he is some weeks from fitness. He limped out of England's Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat against Italy on 24 June, because of a long-standing achilles problem, and so it was a curiosity that he did not undergo the operation until 8 August. Expect Villas-Boas to smile at the English fixation with the armband.</p> <p>The Portuguese must have been pleased so far at how his players have embraced the structure of his training sessions and his ideas. The perception has built, not without foundation, that this Tottenham squad is a more malleable bunch than the one he had at Chelsea. Pre-season has been gruelling, particularly in the 38C heat of Baltimore, but morale is good at present. The players enjoyed the tour of the United States, where highlights included their Fifa 13 console tournament at New York's Grand Central station and Vertonghen's initiation ceremony, when he sang The Beatles' Yellow Submarine.</p> <p>The serious business now looms, both in the market and on the field. Predictions are difficult for Tottenham while the transfer window remains open but one thing is clear: it will be emotional.</p>",

Speaking to reporters later, he said: \"The government of Ecuador is considering a request for asylum and has carried out diplomatic talks with the governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden. However, today we received from the United Kingdom a written threat that they could attack our embassy in London if Ecuador does not give up Julian Assange.</p> <p>\"Ecuador, as a state that respects rights and justice and is a democratic and peaceful nation state, rejects in the strongest possible terms the explicit threat of the British official communication.</p> <p>\"This is unbecoming of a democratic, civilised and law-abiding state. If this conduct persists, Ecuador will take appropriate responses in accordance with international law.</p> <p>\"If the measures announced in the British official communication materialise they will be interpreted by Ecuador as a hostile and intolerable act and also as an attack on our sovereignty, which would require us to respond with greater diplomatic force.</p> <p>\"Such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations and of the rules of international law of the past four centuries.</p> <p>\"It would be a dangerous precedent because it would open the door to the violation of embassies as a declared sovereign space.\" Under international law, diplomatic posts are considered the territory of the foreign nation.</p> <p>The Foreign Office was quick to downplay the drama. A spokesman said Britain had merely sought to \"clarify its position\", according to international law.</p> <p>\"Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadoreans' attention to relevant provisions of our law \u2013 for example, the extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures, or the legal status of diplomatic premises in the UK,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>\"We are still committed to reaching a mutually acceptable solution.\"</p> <p>Ecuador revealed that it would announce its decision regarding Assange's asylum request on Thursday at 1pm.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We have consistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador. The UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences and we remain determined to fulfil this obligation.</p> <p>\"We have an obligation to extradite Mr Assange and it is only right that we give Ecuador the full picture.</p> <p>Correa has said Assange could face the death penalty in the US, and for that reason he considers the asylum request a question of political persecution.</p> <p>Analysts in Ecuador expressed doubts that Britain would raid the embassy.</p> <p>Professor Julio Echeverria of Quito's Flasco University said Britain \"has a long-established tradition in Europe of respecting diplomatic missions\", which under international law are considered sovereign territory.</p> <p>A former Ecuadorean ambassador to London, Mauricio Gandara, told the Associated Press: \"I refuse to believe in this threat because if asylum is granted the British government will not grant safe passage and Mr Assange could be in the embassy for a long time.\"</p> <p>Assange denies the allegations against him, but fears he will be sent to the United States if he goes to Sweden. An offer to the Swedish authorities by Ecuador for investigators to interview Assange inside the London embassy was rejected.</p> <p>A former computer hacker, Assange enraged Washington in 2010 when WikiLeaks published secret US diplomatic cables, has been taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy since 19 June.</p> <p>If Ecuador does give Assange asylum, it is difficult to see how the WikiLeaks boss could physically leave the closely watched embassy and head to an airport without being arrested by British police.</p>",

They kept up a gun battle for several hours, forcing the army to call in extra support from commandos.</p> <p>The commander of the base, Muhammad Azam, was reported to be in a stable condition after being shot in the shoulder.</p> <p>Soldiers searching the facility later found at least two remote-controlled bombs. \"We are checking every inch of the complex to make sure there are no other miscreants,\" said a spokesman, Tariq Mahmood.</p> <p>The president, Asif Ali Zardari, condemned the attack and said the government was determined to eliminate terrorism.</p> <p>It is the third time Minhas and the nearby Pakistan aeronautical complex, where fighter jets are assembled, have been attacked since 2007. Militants have mounted ambitious assaults on military facilities across the country in recent years, including a 16-hour attack on a naval base in Karachi last year that killed at least 10 military personnel.</p> <p>This week Leon Panetta, the US defence secretary, said Pakistan would soon launch a major operation against militants in Waziristan, a semi-autonomous area near the Afghan border that is a hotbed of militancy.</p> <p>Pakistan has long resisted US pressure to attempt to clear the area, particularly North Waziristan, which is home to the Haqqani Network, a Taliban-allied group known for attacks in Kabul. Panetta suggested that the Pakistani Taliban would be the most likely targets of any operation.</p>",
  "<p>Co-production isn't a snappy term nor a quick fix, but the concept is very simple: tap into the talents of service users in order to improve those services.</p> <p>In the short term it would be much easier to carry on as normal with patients taking their share of healthcare, while professionals dole out expert advice in the hope it will change behaviour. However, we believe co-production is our only real hope for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/mar/21/nhs-reform-radical-approach-co-production#start-of-comments\" title=\"\">meeting rising demand from patients with complex care needs</a>.</p> <p>For co-production to be successful, we need to ask ourselves four crucial questions.</p> <h2><strong>Can we share experiences equally?</strong></h2> <p>The first step in co-production is to listen. Service users need to tell their stories, and professionals need to tell theirs. Listening to both the good and bad experiences will help users and professionals to see the potential of working together. Feedback platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.patientopinion.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Patient Opinion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.patientstories.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Patient Stories</a> are both great examples of this.</p> <h2><strong>Making better use of each other</strong></h2> <p>Some patients have the ability to help not only themselves but others too.</p> <p>This is nothing new and is well established. Reformed addicts, for example, make great mentors for recovering addicts. Co-production goes further than that, where service users become assets to the whole community.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://centreforpatientleadership.com/\">Patient Leaders</a> project was established by two patients who wanted to play a role in leadership within the NHS after finding that the only people who were expected \u2013 and trained - to lead were NHS staff.</p> <p>The idea behind Patient Leaders is that people who live with health problems and use services can be a huge benefit to the health system, not a drain on resources. Someone who has reflected on and learnt from the experience of managing their own health can inspire and lead others in a way a professional never could.</p> <p>Community leaders, peer-to-peer support workers, activists, representatives, lay members of CCGs and foundation trust governors have all now passed through the Patient Leaders programme.</p> <h2><strong>Can we solve problems better together?</strong></h2> <p>Co-design is much more challenging than just listening to service users and making use of their talents, as it means sitting down and working out how services should be delivered. How should problems actually be solved in partnership with service users?</p> <p>Relinquishing control, and letting go of your role as a skilled fixer is enormously difficult. We have found that the only way to do this is to make doing it together a habit.</p> <p>We have found that being sociable together is a great way to move forward in co-design. This could mean sharing lunch, getting to know each other as real people with real lives, and going out to see what others have done.</p> <h2><strong>Can we share ownership in the NHS?</strong></h2> <p>The final hurdle of co-production is facing challenges head on, and bringing healthcare staff forward with you. Co-production is not assured, funding is under threat and there is resistance from those who are wedded to the expert paradigm. Yet this can be overcome.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.careplusgroup.org/\">Care Trust Plus </a>in north-east Lincolnshire has been working out how best to involve all stakeholders. They <a href=\"http://www.cihm.leeds.ac.uk/new/quick-links/downloads/to-buy/social-value-the-fair-chance-approach-toolkit/\" title=\"\">mapped out all their owners</a>, brought them together to agree together what social value the organisation should be aiming for (physical and mental health, economic, social), agreed what they need to measure to help make judgements together about what to do, and took some agreed steps to review the impact of those steps with the whole ownership group.</p> <p>This takes a lot of heat off the commissioner, which in turn leads to ideas for alternative ways of delivering services to meet local needs \u2013 some of these might not be delivered by the trust. The brave step is to be open about all of our ways of working and for our leaders to be confident in what can feel initially like giving power away.</p> <p>There is a fear among professionals that they might get 'found out' \u2013 that service users and others will discover that they don't know all the answers. However, co-production \u2013 working together to improve the use of services \u2013 is, after all, most beneficial if we listen to service users themselves.</p> <p><em>Becky Malby is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.cihm.leeds.ac.uk/new/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Innovation in Health Management</em></a></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian Healthcare Network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails on NHS innovation.</strong></p>",
  "<p>If you know you need qualifications for your intended career but are feeling wary of committing to spending three years at university, then it's worth looking into foundation degrees. These are work-based qualifications available at many further education colleges as well as universities, which typically take two years of full-time study and can be topped up to a full honours degree or professional qualification.</p> <p>\"You're not committed to three years: you've got the option of seeing how it goes and deciding whether to go on another year,\" says David Fowler, head of higher education at Sussex Coast College (SCC) in Hastings.</p> <p>\"Studying at a regional college might cost \u00a310,000, and if you do the final year in London you could end up with a degree from a London college for \u00a319,000 \u2013 much better than the \u00a327,000 it would cost you to do the full three years there.</p> <p>\"At a college like ours you get supportive, one-to-one tutoring, and lots of contact time. So it's the best of both worlds. The assumption is students will want to go to university, but a lot aren't ready for it. After two years, lots feel ready to move on: some might stay here and top up their degree, and others go into work.\"</p> <p>Foundation degrees were created a decade ago to fill skills gaps, and there is close involvement between employers, colleges and universities. Ucas lists 2,922 different courses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Art and design are the most common subject areas, studied by more than 20% of foundation students starting in 2008-9, and distance learning is popular.</p> <p>Some 65% of full-time students were still studying six months after gaining their foundation degree, and 47% were working.</p> <p>Foundation degrees are excellent for people who want to get practical knowledge of their chosen industry. \"Staff are industry professionals and bring that world in with them, and conversations always lead to how it is in the outside world.\" says Jeb Haward, head of HE in the arts at SCC.</p> <p>Education consultant Maggie Greenwood agrees: \"[On a foundation degree] the student learns their way around the industry and can see if they like it first. You could be sitting alongside someone who has been in industry for five or six years. If you just do a degree you may not have that depth of experience.\"</p> <p>It's worth thinking ahead about progressing to a full degree, she says, as the syllabus requirements on some foundation and honours courses might mean studying for an extra two years.</p> <p>Foundation degrees can provide a high standard of practical education. Students on the Hastings art and design courses, for instance, regularly do well in prestigious industry awards. Student Olga Pope (see above), who starts her full degree course at Central St Martins College in London in October 2012, recommends finding out where graduates end up studying or working.</p> <p>It's also worth considering what type of experience will suit you best. Jeb Haward at SCC recommends asking questions about contact time, opportunities, and facilities, and to check out the culture in different places.</p> <p><em>For more information and a course search, visit UCAS at </em><a href=\"http://bit.ly/kbzT1U\" title=\"UCAS foundation degrees\"><em>bit.ly/kbzT1U</em></a></p>",

  "<p>On Thursday morning, A-level students up and down the country will receive the results of the exams they took this summer. Much will be written, here at the Guardian and <a href=\"http://www.ucas.ac.uk/\">elsewhere</a>, on what you can do if your results are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/clearing\">worse</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.ucas.ac.uk/students/nextsteps/adjustment/\">better</a>, than you had hoped. But what if your career path takes an unexpected turn not covered by the above?</p> <p>Some months ago, an acquaintance, upon finding out where I studied, approached me and asked if I would have a word with her son who intended to apply to the same institution. The mother's primary concern was the effect of her own background on her son's application. </p> <p>She had done her degree late in life, having had a different career first. She was not somebody who drifted to university straight out of school. She was worried about how her now-graduate status would be perceived by the admissions team, insisting that her path was not the standard one.</p> <p>Not being an admissions tutor, I did not feel able to comment on <em>that</em>. But what I was able to reassure her was that, from what I had seen at university, despite the media's insistence that <a href=\"http://sexyalevels.tumblr.com/post/976716753/for-the-record\">all A-level graduates look the same</a>, there are many routes into higher education and beyond.</p> <p>I had my own anxieties around the admissions process. When I applied, two years after completing my A-levels instead of the more traditional gap of zero to one years, I was plagued by anxiety that, by the time I matriculated, I would be <em>old</em>. I would stand out among the fresh-faced and sprightly 18 and 19-year-olds as the <em>only one</em> who had entered their third decade.</p> <p>As any adult will be able to tell you, my fears were ill-founded. While, perhaps, the majority of students on my course came straight from school or a gap year, there were plenty of us who had taken a more circuitous route. Students who had started a different course, completing one or two years before deciding that that subject was not for them, joined us in our first year. Students who had failed to pass first years elsewhere, students from overseas whose compulsory schooling lasted longer, career-changers and mature students all formed part of the mix. The one time anyone commented on my age was when I handed them an invitation to my birthday party. They looked at me incredulously:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"How come you're going to be <em>twenty-one</em>?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>(<em>Well, 21 years and nine months ago</em> \u2026 began my bristly reply.)</p> <p>I arrived at university with ambitions of becoming a laboratory scientist \u2013 they said I suited the white lab coat and goggles. But my hopes of a career in the \"wet-lab\" blew up in my face, almost literally in one case. Through weekly laboratory practicals, it became apparent that, while I could understand the theory behind the experiment we were doing, the practice was beyond me. I became dependent on my lab partner to do the pipetting and mixing, with me reading and interpreting the directions and writing up the results. I hung up my lab coat as soon as I could. Discussing which among a choice of modules I would study in my final year, one lecturer, himself heavily involved in \"wet-lab\" experiments, objected:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"But, but \u2026 you're going to be doing a desk job!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I did not plan to study for a PhD, either, but computational biology suited me so I took the opportunity. The so-called standard path to being an academic scientist is long: undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, followed by one or more fixed-term training contracts before securing a permanent position. </p> <p>While this route is well-trodden, plenty of people deviate from it but nonetheless achieve notable success. My blogging colleague <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/about/reciprocal-space/\">Stephen</a>, now a <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.curry\">university professor</a>, previously<a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2009/02/07/back_to_the_road_not_travelled/\"> embarked on a career in management</a>. <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/about/mind-the-gap/\">Jenny</a> <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/mindthegap/2010/07/14/in_which_my_dreams_come_true_redux/\">took advantage</a> of the unexpected loss of her job <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Honest-Look-Jennifer-Rohn/dp/1936113112\">to write a novel</a>. <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/about/girl-interrupting/\">Sylvia</a>'s background is even more unconventional!</p> <p>Approaching the end of my PhD, I can unreservedly say I have learned a great deal. Seven years ago, when I filled in my UCAS application, I did not picture myself completing a doctoral thesis. While I have an idea of what I will do once I graduate, I now find it easier to accept uncertainty in the path that I will take.</p> <p>So, if your A-level results throw you a curveball, or you end up taking a circuitous route into your career, don't fret. The non-standard path is more standard than you might think.</p>",
  "<p>The UN has issued a damning 102-page report saying that Syrian government forces and Shabiha fighters have carried out numerous war crimes in the country including murder, torture and the massacre of 100 civilians, almost half of them children, near the town of Houla in May.</p> <p>The UN's independent international commission of inquiry said the violations were the result of \"state policy\". It claimed president Bashar al-Assad's \"security forces and government\" at the highest levels were involved in \"gross violation of international human rights\".</p> <p>The violations included \"unlawful killing, indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations and acts of sexual violence,\" it said. The <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/PRCoISyria15082012_en.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> painted a bleak picture of events on the ground in Syria, noting the situation inside the country has \"deteriorated significantly\" since February.</p> <p>The commission, led by investigator Paulo Pinheiro, also reported that Syria's rebels were guilty of violations including murder, torture and extra-judicial killings. But it said abuses by anti-government groups were not \"of the same gravity, frequency and scale\" as those committed by Syrian regime forces and allied Shabiha militia.</p> <p>The UN's findings were published on another day of carnage inside Syria. Opposition activists said at least 30 people were killed and scores wounded when a Syrian jet bombed a hospital in the northern city of Azaz, close to a strategic Turkish border crossing, which was captured by rebels last month after a fierce battle.</p> <p>The attack reduced several houses in the town to rubble and dozens of men clawed through the concrete and metal debris looking for survivors.</p> <p>Of 11 Lebanese hostages being held there, seven were injured and four were missing, rebel commander Ahmed Ghazali told the Lebanese news channel Al Jadeed.</p> <p>In the capital, Damascus, three people were reportedly wounded in a bomb explosion at a military site near to a hotel where UN observers were staying.</p> <p>The Free Syrian Army (FSA) said it carried out the bombing, targeting a meeting of Syria's military security command \u2013 seemingly an attempted repeat of an attack last month which killed four of Assad's advisers.</p> <p>The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria's membership late on Wednesday in a closing statement from its summit in Mecca, citing Assad's violent suppression of the revolt.</p> <p>The UN's report, covering February-July 2012, was based on nearly 700 interviews with witnesses and survivors, as well as photographs, satellite imagery and forensic and medical reports. The UN complained that its attempts to establish the truth about the conflict had been significantly hampered by what it called a lack of access to the country.</p> <p>After reviewing the evidence, UN commissioners came to the same conclusion about the Houla massacre as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/houla-massacre-reconstructing-25-may?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">most independent observers</a>: that regime forces and Shabiha fighters were responsible. The government, which blamed armed \"terrorists\", refused to allow the UN to investigate \"despite specific requests\", the report said.</p> <p>The UN said the government's version of events was implausible as regime forces were in control of a key checkpoint just outside the village of Taldou on the day of the massacre, 25 May, and 47 witnesses confirmed that Shabiha fighters entered the village before slaughtering its inhabitants.</p> <p>\"The commission concluded that the elements of the war crime of murder had been met,\" the report said. \"The killing of multiple civilians, including women and children, was deliberate and connected to the ongoing armed conflict. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the perpetrators of the crime, at both the Abdulrazzak and Al-Sayed family locations, were [Syrian] government forces and Shabiha members.\"</p> <p>The report also found the Syrian regime guilty of numerous instances of unlawful killing. Typically, it said, the army would blockade an anti-government area and shell it before launching an assault on the ground using special forces and Shabiha. \"Snipers were used extensively,\" the report said, adding that, after securing an area, government troops carried out house-to-house searches, often \"executing\" wounded or captured rebels, and in some cases killing their relatives.</p> <p>This pattern was repeated in numerous towns and cities across Syria, the UN said, including Homs, the cradle of Syria's insurrection.</p> <p>The regime used excessive force in several areas including the northern city of Aleppo, the scene of recent fighting between the government and FSA. The government's ostensible target was \"terrorists\" but, in reality, the attacks were frequently directed at civilian areas, according to the UN.</p> <p>The report noted the regime's widespread use of torture. Detainees have been beaten on the soles of their feet, hung from walls, forcibly shaved, made to imitate dogs and to declare \"there is no god but Bashar\". Some men and women have been subjected to sexual violence. This has taken place both in detention and during house-to-house searches by Shabiha forces, it said. Members of the security forces \"in particular military and air force intelligence,\" were \"primarily responsible\".</p> <p>The report said opposition fighters have also committed human rights abuses by executing captured government soldiers, sometimes after a quick \"quasi-judicial process\". The commission stated that \"several radical Islamic armed groups\" have emerged in Syria and the most important \u2013al-Nusra Front for the People of the Levant \u2013 allegedly has links to al-Qaida and has claimed responsibility for suicide attacks against regime targets.</p> <p>The FSA appears to be sensitive to accusations of abuses and published a code of conduct on Wednesday night. A week earlier, guerillas from its al-Tawhid group were filmed executing 14 members of the pro-regime Berri clan from Aleppo. The code included pledges to respect human rights and to treat prisoners humanely, but it is unclear how many of the disparate city-based units fighting under the FSA banner had signed up to it, or were even aware of it.</p> <p>In a meeting last week in Istanbul with a political representative of Aleppo-based FSA units, Britain's special envoy to the Syrian opposition, Jon Wilks, underlined the need for the rebels to adhere to human rights principles in order to win recognition from the west, and he is believed to have warned the FSA representative that individual commanders could face war crimes prosecutions after the conflict.</p> <p>Western capitals and the Arab League are also putting pressure on opposition groups to coalesce around a transition plan for a post-Assad Syria. After an informal meeting of opposition figures, western and Arab diplomats in Cairo at the beginning of the month, hosted by the Washington-based Brookings Institution, the rebels were asked to nominate delegates to a \"follow-up committee\" to debate the plan.</p> <p>Diplomatic sources said that by Wednesday most of the nominations had been received by the Arab League. The committee will consist of 21 delegates split roughly equally between exile and Syria-based groups, including the Syrian National Council, Syrian Kurds, the FSA, and the network of local coordinating committees. It will work on drafting a final version of the plan in Cairo offices provided by the Arab League.</p> <p>They are expected to agree a compromise draft in the next two weeks to pave the way for what the Arab League hopes will be an all-inclusive opposition conference on transition in mid-September in the Egyptian capital.</p>"
