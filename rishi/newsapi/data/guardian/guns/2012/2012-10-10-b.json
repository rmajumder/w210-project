  "<p>Molly J said of her time in solitary confinement:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I felt] doomed, like I was being banished \u2026 Like you have the plague or that you are the worst thing on earth. Like you are set apart [from] everything else. I guess [I wanted to] feel like I was part of the human race \u2013 not like some animal.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Molly was just 16 years old when she was placed in isolation in an adult jail in Michigan. She described her cell as being \"a box\":</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There was a bed \u2013 the slab. It was concrete \u2026 There was a stainless steel toilet/sink combo \u2026 The door was solid, without a food slot or window \u2026 There was no window at all.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Molly remained in solitary for several months, locked down alone in her cell for at least 22 hours a day.</p> <p>No other nation in the developed world routinely tortures its children in this manner. And torture is indeed the word brought to mind by a shocking report released today by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union. <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2012/10/10/growing-locked-down http://solitarywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fact-sheet-psychological-effects-final.pdf\">Growing Up Locked Down</a> documents, for the first time, the widespread use of solitary confinement on youth under the age of 18 in prisons and jails across the country, and the deep and permanent harm it causes to kids caught up in the adult criminal justice system.</p> <p>Ian Kysel, author of the 141-page report, interviewed or corresponded with more than 125 young people who had spent time in solitary as children in 19 states. To cope with endless hours of extreme isolation, sensory deprivation and crippling loneliness, Kysel learned that some children made up imaginary friends or played games in their heads. Some hid under the covers and tried to sleep as much as possible, while others found they could not sleep at all. </p> <p>\"Being in isolation to me felt like I was on an island all alone dying a slow death from the inside out,\" a California teen wrote in a letter to Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>One young woman, who spent three months in solitary in Florida when she was 15, described becoming a \"cutter\" while in isolation: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I like to take staples and carve letters and stuff in my arm \u2026 Each letter means something to me. It is something I had lost.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>She started by carving into her arm the first letter of her mother's name. Another girl who cut herself in solitary said, \"because it was the only release of my pain.\"</p> <p>In fact, solitary confinement <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/03/22/solitary-confinement-and-mental-illness-us-prisons\">has been shown</a> to cause severe pain and psychological damage to the tens of thousands of adults who endure it every day in American prisons. On children, the report states, the practice has a \"distinct and particularly profound impact.\" Because of \"the special vulnerability and needs of adolescents, solitary confinement can be a particularly cruel and harmful practice when applied to them.\" This is all the more true because for many of these kids, \"developmental immaturity is compounded by mental disabilities and histories of trauma, abuse, and neglect.\"</p> <p>Yet, prisons and jails commonly use isolation as punishment for violating prison rules, including both violent and nonviolent infractions. One boy who entered a Colorado jail at age 15 said the guards doled out stints in solitary for crimes that would, in any other setting, be deemed normal adolescent behavior: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"15 days for not making the bed; 15 days for not keeping the cell door open; 20 or 25 days for being in someone else's cell.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Rikers Island in New York City, more than 14% of adolescents between 16 and 18 spent some period in \"disciplinary segregation\". This <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-05-09/news/rikers-violence-out-of-control/\">despite</a> the fact that nearly half of all adolescents on Rikers have been found to have a \"diagnosed mental disorder\".</p> <p>Other kids are isolated as a form of \"protective custody\", because they are vulnerable to physical or sexual abuse. Even though they are being locked down \"for their own good\", many receive no educational or rehabilitative programming while in solitary, and some are barred from seeing their families.</p> <p>Still, other children are placed in solitary confinement for \"treatment\" purposes, especially after threatening or attempting suicide \u2013 even though isolation has been shown to sharply increase the risk that prisoners will take their own lives.</p> <p>\"There is nothing to do so you start talking to yourself and getting lost in your own little world. It is crushing,\" said Paul K, who spent 60 days in solitary when he was 14. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"You get depressed and wonder if it is even worth living. Your thoughts turn over to the more death-oriented side of life.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>No one knows precisely how many children live in these conditions, since many state and local correctional systems do not keep such data. But the overall rate of solitary confinement in American prisons is thought to be between 3% and 5%, and anecdotal evidence suggests that, in some systems, children may be isolated at even higher rates than adults. Given that nearly 100,000 youth under the age of 18 pass through adult prisons and jails annually, there exists the staggering possibility that thousands of children are spending time in solitary confinement each year.</p> <p>Liz Ryan, who directs the <a href=\"http://www.endjlwop.org/home/staff-andadvisory-committee/\">Campaign for Youth Justice</a>, points out that 20 states have laws requiring that juveniles be kept apart from adult prisoners. Yet most of the nation's 3,000 jails lack dedicated facilities for children \u2013 leaving them with no alternative but to place kids in solitary. A majority of people in jail are there awaiting trial, which means many children in solitary have not even been convicted of a crime.</p> <p>In addition, Ryan said, \"A kid could be held in jail not because there is a risk to public safety, but because they don't have the resources to make bail.\" So the racial and class disparities endemic to the criminal justice system are likely reflected in the population of children languishing in isolation. Ian Kysel said in an interview:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think one of the greatest impediments to change is trying to unravel the policy issue that is at the root of this problem: a criminal justice system that treats kids as if adults without providing resources or guidelines for their care,\" </p> </blockquote> <p>For this reason, Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union recommend that state and the federal governments \"prohibit the housing of adolescents with adults, or in jails and prisons designed to house adults\". However, \"regardless of how they are charged and held,\" Kysel says unequivocally:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We need to ban the solitary confinement of young people across the board. There is simply no reason that a child or adolescent ever needs to be held in a cell, alone, for 22 let alone 24 hours at a stretch.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>For this to happen, though, the American public will need to accept what numerous international bodies have already concluded \u2013 that solitary confinement is cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and clearly rises to the level of torture when levied against vulnerable populations, including children. </p> <p>\"If my story can stop another kid from coming\" to solitary confinement, one Florida teen wrote, then, \"Hopefully my pain serve[s] some purpose.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally referred to the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth; this was amended to the Campaign for Youth Justice at 10am (ET) on 12 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>Republicans have been itching for the match-up between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan since the instant Romney put Ryan on the ticket, if not before. Their <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/gops-move-to-downplay-ryans-debate-skills-isnt-sticking-in-ohio/2012/10/08/d405567a-1156-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_story.html\">confidence</a> that the contest will end in a lopsided victory makes Chris Christie's optimistic pronouncements about the first presidential debate seem downright reserved by comparison: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think Ryan's going to eat him alive.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, hey, Christie turned out to have been right, though the mechanics of transforming Obama's lackluster performance into the devastating loss the pundits keep talking about largely depended on the dismal expectations they held for Romney. Going into Thursday's debate, Ryan instead walks on the brittle hopes of an emboldened GOP. Biden just walks.</p> <p>Biden does not raise the ire among conservatives that Dick Cheney did with liberals; his peculiar charm is to come across as basically competent and up to the job, but without the desire to wield even more power. Republicans do not joke about his cold, black heart and maniacal lust for world domination; one cannot picture him shooting a friend in the face, unless it is with a <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/vice-president-joe-biden-had-a-super-soaker-fight-with-children-at-a-picnic-yesterday/#0\">SuperSoaker</a>. (Imagine Cheney brandishing a toy gun around children without them screaming in terror.)</p> <p>No, the jokes the right makes about Biden have to do with his clumsy malapropos and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/15/news/la-pn-joe-biden-used-chains-metaphor-before-to-hit-republicans-20120815\">rambling metaphors</a>; his speechifying tics (\"literally\", multiple and contradictory references to his rough childhood) give them TMJ but don't ignite conspiracy theories. They anticipate his debate against Ryan not because he seems to be a worthy foe against whom a hard-fought victory would signify a triumph of ideas, but because they think Ryan will steamroll the guy.</p> <p>Still, Biden has a core strength that could prove Ryan's undoing: loyalty untrimmed by ambition. Sure, Biden has found his level in the office of the vice president a wading-pool of influence that Ryan seems to already have judged too shallow for his burgeoning empire of ideas. Biden is content to be regional district manager with a window in his office; Ryan dreams of the corner executive suite (or in this case, the executive suite with no corners). Ryan wants to win, Biden wants <em>his team</em> to win. Biden will take one for the team, no questions asked (he <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2012/president/candidates/obama/2012/10/10/biden-likely-play-hardball-debate/ZMLjHZiub7iCT625LVbaLI/story.html\">went on stage</a> with <em>Sarah Palin</em>); faced with contradictions between his ideas and his running mate's, Ryan just refuses to take questions.</p> <p>Biden's willingness to take orders smoothed over the one instance in this presidency where his exuberance overwhelmed his faithfulness: his <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76103.html\">ahead-of-the-Obama-curve endorsement of same-sex marriage</a>. In general, Biden's excitement is in service of the president: every success is a \"Big Fucking Deal\".</p> <p>Ryan lacks the same level of enthusiasm for Romney, much less his policies. Ryan made a name for himself in Washington by flacking a budget proposal <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/19/newt-gingrich-radical-paul-ryan-thanks_n_864083.html\">too conservative</a> for Newt Gingrich \u2013 so bold (even reckless) that it didn't need a spokesman so much as a target. Ryan's championing of his budget allowed other Republicans to endorse its radical ideas without being tainted by their decidedly unfriendly ideas. When Romney picked Ryan, he hoped to capitalize on the gusto of Ryan's rhetoric, but duck its policy prescriptions. Ryan has thus far been uncomfortable, but tolerant, in his role of help-meat, trading his details and \"roadmap\" visions for generic campaign stumpery.</p> <p>Ryan's success as a running mate has been in direct proportion to his willingness to emphasize style over substance, putting Biden in the unlikely position of wanting his debate opponent to engage on real issues \u2013 and to be the beneficiary of a talkative antagonist. If Biden does exactly what Obama did in the last debate, and just let Ryan motor on, the chances are all the greater that Ryan will say what he actually believes \u2013 so much of which is heroically unpopular with American voters \u2013 and with Mitt Romney. (Ryan is <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/169353/paul-ryan-covers-romneys-right-flank#\">far to the right</a> of most Americans on social issues, just to the right of Romney on the same; when it comes to fiscal policy, he's barely in the same universe as Americans, though, to be fair, at least he exists in a place with recognizable laws of logic. Romney's math floats alongside invisible numbers in an alternate reality.)</p> <p>Romney emerged from the first presidential debate with the wind at his back almost entirely because he took advantage of the national audience to turn swiftly away from the anger and base-baiting politics that characterized his campaign through September. Ryan has had less practice at shaking his personal Etch-a-Sketch than Romney has, and has shown less interest in it. He's more of a paint-by-numbers guy.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan were scrambling on Wednesday to present a coherent position on abortion amid accusations from Democrats that the Republican presidential candidate had hidden his true beliefs in an attempt to appeal to moderate voters.</p> <p>In the wake of a Romney interview with the <a href=\"http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda\">Des Moines Register</a> newspaper in which he said his agenda included no legislation to restrict abortion, his campaign team launched a damage limitation exercise to assure conservative voters that he remained staunchly pro-life. </p> <p>Within hours of the comments being published on Tuesday, Romney's campaign insisted that he was against abortion, telling the conservative National Review Online that Romney \"would, of course, support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is proudly pro-life, and he will be a pro-life president,\" said his spokeswoman Andrea Saul in a statement.</p> <p>But on Wednesday, an intervention by Ryan during a campaign stop deepened the confusion. Asked by reporters about the differences between him and Romney on the issue, Ryan, who is against abortion in all cases, including rape, incest and where the mother's life is in danger, said: \"Our position is unified. Our position is consistent and hasn't changed.\"</p> <p>As the controversy escalated, Romney himself sought to draw a line under it. </p> <p>He told reporters in Ohio: \"I think I've said time and again that I'm a pro-life candidate and I'll be a pro-life president. The actions I'll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I've indicated that I will reverse the Mexico City position of the president. I will reinstate the Mexico City policy which keeps us from using foreign aid for abortions overseas.\"</p> <p>Romney's anti-abortion views are less extreme than Ryan's. While he has stated that he supports the overturning of the Roe v Wade supreme court decision, he believes there should be exceptions to a ban on abortion. </p> <p>Ryan, by contrast, has sponsored a series of bills that would either restrict abortion or access to contraception, or both. The differing views of the two men over the issue was highlighted most recently in August when Ryan's views were tied to those of Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri who was abandoned by the party after comments on \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Two months ago, when asked a similar question about the difference on abortion between him and Romney, Ryan acknowledged the difference between them when he told reporters he was \"proud of my pro-life record\" but said that Romney set the policy.</p> <p>A call to the Romney campaign from the Guardian to clarify the position \u2013 and what Ryan's \"unified\" comment meant \u2013 was not immediately returned.</p> <p>Romney's initial remarks to the Des Moines Register were pounced on by Barack Obama campaign officials, who accused him of \"cynically and dishonestly\" hiding his true anti-abortion position.</p> <p>Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign press secretary, told reporters: \"We're not saying that he's changed his mind on these issues. We're saying that he is trying to cover up his beliefs.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Every step of the way he has been anti-choice, against Roe v Wade.\"</p> <p>Reaction among conservatives to Romney's remarks was also critical. A comment piece in the conservative newspaper The Weekly Standard on Wednesday titled \"Did Mitt Romney forget?\" suggested that he was \"mistaken\" and had simply not realised how many issues related to abortion funding he could influence.</p> <p>\"The issue here does not appear to be that Romney is backing off his stance on abortion \u2013 indeed, he says he will use an executive order to cut off funding to groups that perform abortion overseas,\" it read. \"But he is mistaken in thinking that there aren't issues related to abortion funding are handled through the legislative process at the federal level.\"</p> <p>Romney's past commitments have included ensuring US laws reflect \"values of preserving life\". He has previously promised to: support foetal pain legislation, which bans abortion after 20 weeks, on the much-debated basis that foetuses can feel pain at that stage; end public health funds for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortions; and support a decades-old ban on federal funds for abortions.</p> <p>He supports the reversal of Roe v Wade, but believes in exceptions for victims of rape and incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.</p> <p>Romney, who had been pro-choice as governor of Massachusetts, repeatedly asserted his anti-abortion credentials as he battled to win the Republican nomination. During a televised debate in Charleston on 19 January before the South Carolina primary, for example, he said: \"You can count on me as president of the United States to pursue a policy that protects the life of the unborn, whether here in this country or overseas. And I'll reverse the policies of this president.\"</p> <p>In his acceptance speech to the Republican convention in Tampa in August, he promised that as president he would \"protect the sanctity of life\".</p> <p>Anti-abortion groups said on Wednesday they didn't see Romney's comments as evidence of a change of heart. Tony Perkins, president of the anti-abortion Family Research Council, told <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/anti-abortion-activists-call-romneys-new-comments-a-gaffe-not-a-change-of-heart.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> the Romney campaign called him soon after the remarks were published by the Iowa newspaper and assured him it didn't represent a shift from his support for pro-life issues.</p> <p>Romney's comments came as he sought to maintain his recent appeal to female voters in the closing stages of the presidential race. A poll by Pew this week found Romney neck-and-neck among women with Barack Obama, who has held an enormous advantage with this demographic.</p>",
  "<p>Two former heads of US diplomatic security in Libya have told a congressional hearing that requests for additional agents to protect American officials and premises in the face of a growing threat from armed militias were rejected by the state department ahead of the attack on the Benghazi consulate that killed the US ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other officials.</p> <p>At a heated hearing before the House of representatives oversight committee, Republicans painted a picture of an incompetent state department failing to heed warnings of a growing terrorist threat or to prepare for a possible attack on the anniversary of 9/11, and then covering up the circumstances of the full scale militia assault that killed Stevens. They also accused Obama administration officials of attempting to suppress unclassified documents because they were politically embarrassing.</p> <p>Democrats described the investigation as a partisan political move intended to embarrass the White House in the run up to the presidential election.</p> <p>Hours before the hearing, the state department was forced into an embarrassing retreat on its claim that the attackers used the cover of a popular protest outside the consulate as cover for the assault. Officials acknowledged on Tuesday that there was no protest and that as it occurred on September 11 it was likely timed to mark the anniversary of al-Qaida's assault on the US 11 years ago.</p> <p>The former head of embassy security in Libya, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood, said that he recognised the situation in Libya was volatile and that he and other officials pressed for additional agents to protect the consulate in Benghazi. </p> <p>\"The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there \u2026 Diplomatic security remained weak,'' he said. \"The RSO (regional security officer) struggled to obtain additional personnel there, but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with.\"</p> <p>The committee chairman, Darrel Issa, then released state department cables not previously made public containing the requests for more security including one from the then ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz.</p> <p>Another official, Eric Nordstrom, who was responsible for protecting US diplomats in Libya, said that he too sought additional resources. But he said he was told over the phone by a senior state department official responsible for handling the request, Charlene Lamb, not to make any more because \"there would be too much political cost\".</p> <p>After that Republican members of Congress honed in on Lamb, who was also a witness, accusing her of failing to recognise the seriousness of the threat.<br>Lamb responded that the requests were for more personnel in Tripoli and it would have made no difference to how many security men would have been protecting the Benghazi consulate where protection was in any case mostly in the hands of a pro-government militia.</p> <p>\"We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi on the night of 9/11,\" Lamb testified.</p> <p>However, Republican attempts to accuse the state department of leaving the consulate vulnerable by refusing requests for more security were delivered a blow when Nordstrom was asked how many agents he wanted to protect the Benghazi site. He said he asked for three. The hearing then heard that there were five at the time of the attack.</p> <p>Congressman Jason Chaffetz noted that after the state department declined to increase the number of security personnel it did raise the danger pay of Wood and his colleagues.</p> <p>Nordstrom suggested that it might have been difficult to protect the consulate in any circumstance.</p> <p>\"I had not seen an attack of such ferocity and intensity previously in Libya nor in my time with the diplomatic security service,\" he said. \"I'm concerned that this attack signals a new security reality, just as the 1983 Beirut marine barracks bombings did for the marines, the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings did for the state department and 9/11 did for our entire country.\"</p> <p>But Nordstrom warned that it would be wrong to react to the attack and the continuing threat by retreating to a bunker.</p> <p>Republican congressmen hammered away at the accusation that the state department had failed to heed warnings of an escalating threat and that officials gave \"demonstrably false statements\" about the circumstances of the attack.</p> <p>The committee released a memo from Stevens sent on the day he was killed in which he described an array of armed militias competing for control and some of their leaders as criticising the US for taking political sides by backing the government in Tripoli. He also described growing Islamist influence in the town of Derna, to the east of Benghazi.</p> <p>However <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/9-11-12-Memo.pdf\">the memo also reported</a> that Benghazi council said the security situation was improving and appealed for American investment.</p> <p>Nordstrom described a chaotic situation in Libya shortly after the revolution, saying that the new government had so little control that it could not provide security for diplomats and embassies.</p> <p>\"We could not rely on the Libyan government for security, intelligence and law enforcement help to identify emerging threats or to ask them for assistance in mitigating those threats. In Benghazi however, the government of Libya through the 17 February Martyrs Brigade was able to provide us consistent armed security since the very earliest days of the revolution,\" he said.</p> <p>Nordstrom said that the long-term plan was to create a local force to protect the consulate.</p> <p>Issa accused the administration of a cover-up of the circumstances of the attack because for days the administration stuck with the claim that the attack was made under the cover of a popular protest against an anti-Islam film.</p> <p>One witness, assistant secretary of state Patrick Kennedy, defended the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, who has faced calls to resign for her statements in the days after the attack saying it was a response to an anti-Muslim video that prompted demonstrations across the Middle East. </p> <p>Kennedy said Rice based her assertion on the best information she had at the time and hinted that it came from the intelligence services but said he could not discuss it in public.</p> <p>The hearing at times degenerated into a spat over what is classified information after Chaffetz attempted to prevent Kennedy speaking about exactly who was protecting US officials and premises in Libya on the grounds he was revealing classified information. He also objected to a satellite image readily available on Google.</p> <p>A Democratic member of the committee, Stephen Lynch, expressed astonishment, saying that Chaffetz had pressed for the hearing specifically to air accusations that the state department had not provided sufficient security.</p> <p>The mother of one of the Americans killed in the Benghazi attack, Glenn Doherty, has accused Mitt Romney of using her son's death for political ends.</p> <p>\"I don't trust Romney,\" Barbara Doherty told a Boston television station, WHDH. \"He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda. It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama.\"</p>",
  "<p>The longstanding commercial relationship between BT and Huawei is being investigated by parliament's intelligence and security committee, its chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind has confirmed to the Guardian.</p> <p>In a move that could cause disruption to major broadband and mobile phone infrastructure projects in the UK should security fears be raised about Huawei's equipment, the committee is \"reviewing the whole presence of Huawei in regard to our critical national infrastructure and whether that should give rise for concern\".</p> <p>The committee has been taking evidence in private for some months from members of the security services, and is considering whether to make some of its findings and recommendations public. A report will be sent to David Cameron before Christmas.</p> <p>\"In the background are allegations that Huawei has links to the People's Liberation Army in China, and that any Chinese company is ultimately subject to the Chinese government,\" said Rifkind.</p> <p>Huawei is a supplier to BT, which gave the Chinese company its first big contract in western Europe in 2005, using its equipment to modernise its copper broadband service. Huawei is now a big supplier to BT's national rollout of fibre-optic broadband, one of the largest infrastructure projects under way in the UK. Its equipment has also been used to build the 4G network being launched at the end of this month by EE, the owner of Orange and T-Mobile, and other clients include TalkTalk, Vodafone and BSkyB.</p> <p>\"We are looking into the relationship that has developed between Huawei and British Telecom and the implications for the UK,\" said Rifkind. \"We wanted to look at the historical background to that contract, to what extent there were security concerns at the time, whether and to what extend the British government were involved in these decisions, and whether there have been any causes for concern that have arisen since Huawei became involved in our telecoms infrastructure.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Huawei said of the intelligence and security committee's inquiry, for which the firm has not so far been asked to give evidence: \"We have been operating in the UK since 2001 under UK scrutiny and procedures. We have regular contact with the government and welcome all discussions and questions.\"</p> <p>Two years ago, the company established a centre in Banbury where its equipment for BT and other companies can be tested and monitored, in co-operation with security services staff. A BT spokesman said: \"Huawei is one of our major suppliers. This has in no way affected our ability to ensure the security of our networks.\"</p> <p>A negative report card from British politicians would be embarrassing for Cameron, who met Huawei's founder Ren in Downing Street only last month. It could also disrupt the roll out of fibre and 4G mobile internet in the UK.</p> <p>\"If the UK takes the same stance as the US, and I would be surprised if they did, there will be all kinds of consequences,\" said Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m, chief executive of telecoms consultancy Northstream. \"It would mean that you need to agree on terms for de-commissioning, find a replacement vendor, tear out the old equipment, install the new. It's a complicated costly exercise that will delay whatever plans they have. There is an impact for the major infrastructure projects in the UK.\"</p> <p>The Shenzhen-based company has been blacklisted in Australia, where it was barred from supplying the country's new national fibre network, and the US House of Representatives' intelligence select committee this week called for Huawei and its Chinese rival ZTE to be excluded from doing business in the US on the grounds that their equipment could be used by the state or other interests in China for cyber-espionage.</p> <p>The Canadian government is indicating that it too might exclude the company from involvement in government communications projects because of potential security risks. In Brussels, the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, was gathering evidence for an inquiry into both companies on the grounds that state support may allow them to sell equipment at a loss, but that was put on ice after European competitors declined to file formal complaints. A source has told the Guardian this was for fear of reprisals from China.</p> <p>At the centre of the concerns is that Huawei's networks are not secure and could be open to espionage. The US has voiced concerns that China could use equipment made by the company \u2013 whose founder, Ren, was once a technician in the People's Liberation Army \u2013 to spy on communications and threaten vital systems through computerised links.</p> <p>The chairman of the US House of Representatives' intelligence committee, Mike Rogers, himself a former FBI agent, said: \"My argument is that if this helps the Chinese government get out of the business of cyber-espionage, then that is great.\"</p> <p>Huawei denies all links with spying and cybercrime, and calls the allegations \"a monstrous, market-distorting, trade-distorting policy precedent that could be used in other markets against American companies\".</p> <p>While its US presence is limited, Huawei has used the UK as a launchpad for rapid expansion in Europe, where its rise has contributed to the fall of a number of western rivals.</p> <p>One of the first casualties was the venerable British firm Marconi, which lost its largest client when BT chose Huawei - and a handful of other suppliers - for its 21st century network copper broadband upgrade. Within a year, the telecoms and defence firm, once a bellwether of the UK economy, had been broken up and sold.</p> <p>A similar fate has befallen American vendors Nortel and Motorola, and a once bustling sector is braced for further retrenchment, with both France's Alcatel-Lucent and Finland's Nokia Siemens Networks having experienced financial turbulence.</p> <p>Unlike the state controlled oil, energy and banking groups that dominate the list of China's largest companies, Huawei is one of a select few, like the internet group Alibaba, to have a brand that is familiar to Western consumers.</p> <p>Stan Abrams, a Beijing-based corporate lawyer, lecturer and commentator, says \"reciprocity\" has been a feature of Chinese trade policy, and there could be repercussions for Western companies hoping to do business in China after Huawei's public humiliation at the hands of the US legislature.<br></p>",
  "<p>It is fascinating to see Tennessee Williams's tremendous play so soon after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/oct/09/desire-under-the-elms-review\">Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms, which has just been revived in London</a>. Both were objects of scandal when first written, both feature sexually powerful heroines, both make hypnotic use of verbal repetition. If Williams's play now makes the greater visceral impact, I suspect it is because it confronts head-on the big issue of American drama: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/30/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof\">the conflict between the necessary truth and the consoling lie</a>.</p> <p>This comes out with total clarity in Sarah Esdaile's richly detailed production. We may be in a plush Mississippi mansion that, in Frances O'Connor's design, is surrounded by standing water and bedecked with hanging greenery. But it is also a place where people are stripped of their illusions. Brick has to accept that his alcoholism and refusal to sleep with his wife, Maggie, are the result not just of guilt over the death of his friend, Skipper, but of his repressed homosexuality. Equally, Brick's cancerous father, Big Daddy, comes to realise that wealth offers no shield against mortality and that \"the human animal is a beast that dies\". In the final act, Esdaile too readily accepts the <a href=\"http://goinside.com/2000/05/20/an-analysis-of-cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof/\">textual revisions Williams made at the promptings of his original director, Elia Kazan</a>; otherwise this is a highly impressive production.</p> <p>It's especially good at the Williams trademark: what he called <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b_Ocr-WlM7wC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;lpg=PA391&amp;dq=%22human+extremities+of+emotion%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S7J8PPs7Aq&amp;sig=2GKNuh3B9SMQRBvLt8pqwUSS4eA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rZd1UOKxB8Oq0AWAioCQDA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human%20extremities%20of%20emotion%22&amp;f=false\">\"human extremities of emotion\"</a>. And you see this, at its best, in the great second-act confrontation between Big Daddy and Brick. Richard Cordery, whom <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org.uk/explore/hamlet/2004-video-secrets-and-lies.aspx\">I'm used to seeing as a scheming Shakespearean baron</a>, is astonishing as Big Daddy. He has transformed himself into a crude Mississippi redneck with a sharp tongue and vile temper: \"Fuck the goddamned preacher,\" he cries at one point, and, when his privacy is invaded by one of his unquantifiable grandchildren, he raises a menacing hand. Yet Cordery also moves you by his patent love for Brick, and by the cries, suggesting a tortured animal, he utters as the cancerous pain suddenly strikes. This a deeply complex Big Daddy: a southern vulgarian who prides himself on growing tolerance, as well as cotton, on his plantation.</p> <p>Jamie Parker, as Brick, matches him blow for blow and brings out more clearly than most actors the incapacitating effect of drink: as the night goes on, SeductiveParker's speech audibly thickens and he later passes out on the patio. All of which makes me wonder whether Maggie's belief that she can persuade this sozzled wreck to finally have sex with her isn't just another form of delusion.</p> <p>No one could deny, however, that <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3817518/Downton-Abbey-newcomer-Zoe-Boyle-is-prepared-to-be-hated-by-shows-fans.html\">Zoe Boyle</a> does everything possible to make herself seductive. In the first act, she lasciviously rubs her body against Brick's, tauntingly peels off her stockings when talking of Big Daddy's lust for her, and poses provocatively on a chaise longue. Occasionally I felt this was more pouting <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048973/\">Baby Doll</a> than Maggie the Cat; but Boyle, although young for the role, catches perfectly Maggie's desperate need for bodily warmth and affection.</p> <p>There is firm support from Amanda Boxer as Big Mama and from Hannah Stokely, who lends Big Daddy's prodigiously fertile daughter-in-law a steely attractiveness. But the big virtue of Esdaile's production is that it shows British actors are at home in this world of unbuttoned emotion and that Williams's attack on private and public mendacity \u2013 or \"meandacity\", as it becomes in Big Daddy's pronunciation \u2013 has lost none of its potency.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/extra/2012/oct/05/extra-cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-offer-pfp?newsfeed=true\">- Guardian Extra: 2 for 1 ticket offer and join the Guardian team for a one-off tweet night</a></p> <h2>Tweet your reviews</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=CatReview\" class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\" data-related=\"GuardianStage\" data-url=\"http://gu.com/catreview\">Tweet #CatReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>  <p>Have you been to see Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at West Yorkshire Playhouse?

  "<p>Prince Bandar bin Sultan has been coordinating Saudi Arabia's policies towards the Syrian uprising since being appointed intelligence chief by King Abdullah in July. Bandar's reputation as an inveterate networker and hawk have fuelled anticipation about how he will handle the bloodiest crisis of the Arab spring.</p> <p>In 1983 Bandar, the king's nephew, became Saudi ambassador to Washington, where he spent 22 years. He was close to presidents Reagan and both Bushes \u2013 and was even known as \"Bandar Bush\". He negotiated huge arms deals for the Kingdom \u2013 including the infamous \u00a343bn<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/bae-saudi-yamamah-deal-background?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> al-Yamamah agreement with the UK</a>. The Guardian reported allegations that he had received \u00a31bn in secret payments from BAE.</p> <p>Part of the mystery surrounding him involved his role in backing the Mujahideen who fought the Soviet Union in Afghanistan with CIA support in the 1980s. He is famously hostile to Iran, the Saudi kingdom's great rival, and is said to advocate links with Israel, seeing it as a lesser threat than the Islamic republic.</p> <p>The normally flamboyant Bandar \u2013 he has a penchant for cigars and flies in a private Airbus \u2013 had kept a low profile since returning to Riyadh in 2005 and becoming head of the national security council. But he was often photographed with senior US officials, most recently during a visit by the CIA director, General David Petraeus.</p> <p>Bandar took over the Syria \"file\" from the king's son Abdelaziz, a deputy foreign minister. The move also followed rumours of inefficiency at the intelligence agency. Bandar organized the visit of Manaf Tlass, the Sunni general and Assad associate who defected from Syria in July. Shortly after his appointment it was rumoured \u2013 evidently falsely \u2013 that he had been killed in an explosion in Riyadh. Iranian and pro-Assad media suggested it was retaliation for the assassination of four of Assad's senior security chiefs in a bomb attack in Damascus a few days earlier.</p> <p>Veteran Saudi-watchers say that decision-making in Riyadh, where government is highly personalised and the senior royals ageing, is currently in poor shape. The king is 88 and frail, Crown Prince Salman, 76, abroad and the foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, 72, convalescing.</p> <p>In a rare public glimpse of his movements, Bandar was reported to be in the Qatari capital Doha on Wednesday, holding talks with the Emir, Sheikh Hamad. It would be surprising if the Syrian crisis was not on their agenda. \"We need to wait and see what Bandar will do with the Syria file,\" said one Saudi source. \"People will be watching carefully.\"</p>",
  "<p>The chancellor's proposals to reform housing benefit for the under-25s are not new (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/conservative-welfare-cuts-analysis\" title=\"\">Analysis</a>, 9 October). The Thatcher government's Social Security Acts of 1986 and 1988 were underpinned by the assumption that families should take greater financial responsibility for their young people. This resulted in the ending of income support for 16- and 17-year-olds, except on proof of \"severe hardship\", and the abolition of \"householder status\" for under-25s, by the introduction of lower rates of income support for this age group. The impact of these changes proved disastrous.</p> <p>First, many care leavers for whom family support was not an option experienced poverty and homelessness. This led to campaigning activity by care leavers which resulted in \"exceptions\" for limited periods. However, it was not until the introduction of the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 that there was a comprehensive response to address their plight.</p> <p>Second, there was a larger but at that time lesser-known group of abused and neglected older teenagers who suffered greatly at the hands of their parents. In order to qualify for benefits so that they could leave their families, or remain in their own accommodation, they had to prove \"severe hardship\" or \"estrangement\" at regular intervals. Many gave up on these draconian tests, officially described then, and proposed now, as \"safety nets\", but which reflected the long shadows of the deterrent poor law. They either remained and suffered at home or ended up homeless. We have become increasingly aware of the problems of maltreated young adults and developed more compassionate and effective policies to prevent youth homelessness. It would be inhumane to turn the clock back.<br><strong>Professor Mike Stein</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p>",
  "<p>George Monbiot's article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/empire-torture-kenya-catastrophe-europe\" title=\"\">Colonised and coloniser, empire's poison infects us all</a>, 9 October) is probably the most stomach-churning ever printed by you. The depths of barbaric depravity of the British colonial forces in their attempted suppression of the Kenyan anti-colonial struggle almost beggars belief. However,&#xa0;as Monbiot correctly points out, the atrocities carried out in Kenya are not isolated, as many Irish, Arab, Indian,&#xa0;Chinese and other people can no&#xa0;doubt testify.</p> <p>But these revelations also raise important questions. For instance, are any of those British army and colonial officers who organised the roasting alive of prisoners still themselves alive? If so, can they be arrested forthwith? Would Gordon Brown, Niall Ferguson, and other recent apologists for the British empire like to comment on the \"British values\", to use Brown's phrase, revealed by such colonial barbarism?</p> <p>The question also arises about the role of the Queen. Was she aware of these actions of her servants? If so, did she request that they be arrested, as apparently she did in the case of Abu Hamza? In the light of these recent revelations, perhaps a diamond jubilee penance could be organised as soon as possible.<br><strong>Dr David Hookes</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is difficult to know where to begin in correcting the impression given by George Monbiot's sweeping condemnation of all colonial rule. First, the reasons why the colonial regime in Kenya in the 1950s allowed such disgraceful treatment of the Mau Mau fighters and suspects to occur need to be understood. The fact that Kenya was a settler colony has a lot to do with it. The Kikuyu victims were essentially the dispossessed who had lost land and livelihood to more prosperous \"loyalist\" Kikuyu as well as the settlers, and tended to be disliked by non-Kikuyu Africans. The Kikuyu fighters were themselves not exactly blameless as far as atrocities were concerned, and their behaviour encouraged the extreme racialist views Monbiot mentions to gain currency. The second point is that Kenya was not typical, and to assume that it was is a slur on the work of many colonial service personnel, teachers, missionaries and other British expatriates in territories such as nearby Tanzania and Uganda who were trying to improve conditions and opportunities for African people.<br><strong>Professor Roy Bridges</strong><br><em>Newmachar, Aberdeenshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot claims that the colonial mindset is alive and kicking. It certainly is. Blessed with Tony Blair as its most prominent advocate, it now appears as liberal intervention, a doctrine that sanctions the use of massive lethal force as a means of imposing a more \"advanced\" order, one in which the free market is sovereign. Bestowing the benefits of empire in the old days saw the Maxim machine-gun come into its own \u2013 Kitchener's slaughter of the Mahdi's followers at Omdurman comes to mind. Today we have the drone and Hellfire missiles for the tribal areas of Pakistan.<br><strong>John Lloyd</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is probably right in everything he says about colonialism and the evil it caused. But I feel a level of irritation that I regularly feel here in Germany. The reason for this is the Germans' \"Holocaust blinkers\". First, we shouldn't deny that the Holocaust was uniquely horrific. However, this event in Germans' history leads all too often to the kneejerk response of \"well, it couldn't be as bad as the Holocaust, could it?\" For me this is an enormous distraction from current issues and hinders us from learning from traumatic events in our past.</p> <p>A regular frustration of mine is when current abuses \u2013 such as the west sourcing cheap goods from ultra-low wage regions, war born out of the need for us to control the oil-producing regions of the world, EU fishing fleets that head off to rake the African coastline clean \u2013 come up in conversation and my German friends agree, but then go off on tangents examining their own guilt about the injustices which Germany perpetrated under Hitler.</p> <p>Here there is a risk that Britain will develop \"colonial blinkers\", with people flailing themselves with the guilt of the past while forgetting that the cheap outfit they just bought for a couple of pounds was produced under conditions that are often equivalent to and sometimes worse than those under colonialism.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br><em>Cologne, Germany</em></p>",
  "<p>There are good reasons why a criminal trial is set up as the state against the alleged offender, with the victim's role only to tell the truth as a witness if required.

  "<p>Police in the country's biggest force are to use the licensing laws to shut down pubs and clubs where high levels of rape and sexual assaults take place as part of a radical attempt to create a hostile environment for rapists.</p> <p>In his first interview, the new head of the Metropolitan police's sex crime unit, Sapphire \u2013 which has been beset by controversy \u2013 has revealed a rape prevention strategy that will target men and women.</p> <p>It will challenge male behaviour while attempting to speak to women about reducing their vulnerability to rape.</p> <p>Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Duthie is taking action as the Metropolitan police investigates a big decrease in rape reporting, which has sparked an outcry from victims' groups concerned that women have lost confidence in the police because of failings in the unit supposed to be the gold standard for the country.</p> <p>This month a former Sapphire officer, Ryan Coleman-Farrow, faces sentence for failing to investigate rapes, pursue suspects or submit evidence over a three-year period. His activities have left 11 alleged sex attackers at large.</p> <p>At Southwark crown court, Coleman-Farrow has admitted 13 counts of misconduct in public office for failing to investigate 10 rapes and three sexual assaults over three years. The officer, who was based in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, has admitted falsifying computer records to bring cases to an end when no such decision had been made.</p> <p>Another detective from Sapphire is being investigated as part of what one source said was a major inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into almost identical offences to Coleman-Farrow.</p> <p>Duthie said he was determined to root out below-standard officers. \"It is a big responsibility investigating rape; if we get it wrong, a rapist walks free, I don't want that to happen on my watch.\" His tactics to bring more rapists to justice and prevent sex attacks taking place include:</p> <p>\u2022 Using the licensing laws for the first time to shut down pubs and clubs which generate a high level of rapes and sexual assaults.</p> <p>\u2022 Using covert police tactics to target men who have never been charged and convicted of rape, but where intelligence suggests they are perpetrators.</p> <p>\u2022 A hard-hitting prevention campaign to target male behaviour and speak to women about reducing their vulnerability.</p> <p>\u2022 Increasing supervision of his officers by restructuring Sapphire into five or six large regional teams.</p> <p>He also pledged to reduce what he says is the unacceptable 13 hours it takes on average for victims to be interviewed and medically examined after reporting rape.</p> <p>On the unprecedented use of licensing laws to deter potential sex offenders, he said: \"If you were in Lewisham High Street at night and someone had a glass or bottle stuck in their neck, we would use the licensing legislation to close that place down. But until now we haven't done that for sexual offences.</p> <p>\"We are looking at areas that generate high levels of sexual offences, identifying nightclubs or pubs where this might happen, and which we can link back to rapes and use the licensing laws against these premises.\"</p> <p>Duthie admits using covert policing tactics is unlikely to lead to the male targets being convicted of rape. Instead he hopes they will be taken off the streets for other offences. \"These are Al Capone type tactics. We will possibly end up prosecuting them for something other than rape. We don't want them out there committing sexual offences so if they are disqualified from driving or locked up for having weapons this will help prevent rape.\"</p> <p>Duthie's new rape prevention campaign takes its lead in part from a strategy launched in Scotland last month. \"We can stop it\" targets young men aged 18-27 and asks them to consider their behaviour and become role models with their peers to prevent rape.</p> <p>Duthie is aware that the Met's intention to target women as well as men could prove controversial. \"We have to make sure we are not targeting the victims but the suspects,\" said Duthie. \"But we do need to educate people that if they go out and get hammered they are vulnerable \u2013 vulnerable to being assaulted \u2013 vulnerable to falling over and vulnerable to being raped.</p> <p>\"80% of our victims have one form of vulnerability or another, a permanent or temporary vulnerability through drink, drugs, mental health, age. So there are things that we can do to prevent the offence happening in the first place.\"</p> <p>One of Duthie's biggest challenges is the big fall in the reporting of rapes in greater London over the last year, which appears to buck the national trend. Women's groups blame a loss of confidence in the police due to the high-profile failures by Sapphire in the past five years.</p> <p>In greater London, the latest figures show the reporting of rape is down 15% from April to the end of September to 1,444 reports, compared with 1,712 for the same period last year.</p> <p>\"This is a concern for us,\" said Duthie. \"Is that because there's less rape happening, is it because we are intervening earlier in domestic violence or is it because there are fewer people reporting?</p> <p>\"If they are not reporting, why are they not reporting? Is it because victims are losing confidence because there is a perception they won't get justice, and people wont get charged? We are doing significant work at the moment with our partners looking into all of that.\"</p> <p>He said that although reporting of rapes was down, detections were up since he had taken over \u2013 with 330 men charged between April to September this year compared with 259 in the same period last year.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Women Against Rape said the new tactics were a diversion. \"These so-called prevention strategies are a diversion from what's needed: thorough unbiased investigations and prosecutions so rapists are caught and convicted, and rape is discouraged,\" the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\"Telling men not to rape will have no effect when the reality is that 93% of rapes don't reach conviction. Victims want their attackers prosecuted for rape, not for some unconnected crime.</p> <p>\"What makes women vulnerable is that the authorities side with the rapist rather than the victim: victims are disbelieved, especially if they have been attacked before.\"</p>",
  "<p>Chris Grayling as justice secretary bothers me far less than he would in almost any other department. The legal profession has many years of experience in foiling, scotching, contradicting and plain ignoring the conference soundbites of politicians. I'll worry about Grayling's tough-guy pledges when I see the lord chief justice&#xa0;with his (metaphorical) glasses steamed up, and not before.</p> <p>However, just because I'm not worried doesn't mean I'm not interested, particularly in this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/09/tories-go-back-basics-burglars\" title=\"\">pledge to change the law to protect homeowners who overreact to an intruder</a>.</p> <p>This is number three in the chart of all-time conference classics. At two, there's the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">abortion time-limit conversation</a>, started by people with no intention of changing the law, but who just want to self-identify as the kind of politicians who seek a controlling interest in a stranger's uterus. At number one, \"get tough on immigrants, especially the ones with cats\", Theresa May's internet-generated content that she could have got from a website called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nigel-farage-tory-donors-ukip\" title=\"\">www.theNigelFarage-izer.com</a>. It's a bid to steal votes from Ukip, which in itself is classic tactics-over-strategy: people crunching numbers worry about the marginal effect of not being quite rightwing enough in closely contested constituencies with a potentially split vote. Nobody (apparently) is worrying about the more damaging effect of not being quite rational enough to appeal to the centre ground of any constituency. Anybody who wants to live out their lives without ever seeing another Conservative government will find this quite cheering.</p> <p>The intruder debate \u2013 because it is so niche, so far to the fringes of life's tapestry, so completely unrelated to meaningful policymaking \u2013 I think of as&#xa0;almost poetic, the conference season's dream sequence. Parliamentary briefings on self-defence in your own home always refer to their figures as an <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/key_issues/Key%20Issues%20Use%20of%20force%20against%20intruders.pdf\" title=\"\">\"informal trawl\" by the crown prosecution service</a>. That's code for \"we'd love to look more closely, but frankly there are so few of them that we cannot be arsed\". Between 1990 and 2005, there were only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19886504\" title=\"\">seven prosecutions that resulted from a domestic burglary</a>; less than one every two years. No wonder the Daily Mail gets so excited \u2013 to them, that's like seeing a comet.</p> <p>To people who, considering its rarity, take little interest in self-defence as a political or social problem, it may come as a surprise to learn how much damage you are already allowed to inflict on an intruder. In 2009 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/19/burglary-murder-charge-dropped\" title=\"\">Omari Roberts stabbed two teenaged intruders</a>, one fatally, and the case against him was dropped; in September a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-19463707\" title=\"\">couple shot two burglars and weren't charged</a>. The law still takes a dim view of premeditated self-defence \u2013 so, for instance, if you lie in wait for a burglar, catch him, tie him up, throw him in a pit and set fire to him, you will be prosecuted. It's hard to fathom how you could, as suggested by Tory MP Priti Patel, \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9530564/Conservative-MPs-demand-greater-rights-for-householders-against-burglars.html\" title=\"\">stop treating criminals like victims and victims like criminals</a>\" in a situation like that, without having an open-door policy on sociopaths.</p> <p>If you think that sounds like an outlier, every case is an outlier. There is no normal in a crime that scarcely ever happens. At least with abortion and immigration, the figures are significant; it seems curious that a situation which so few people have ever encountered should ascend to the status of the \"hot-button issue\".</p> <p>The last party conference to be dominated by this was Labour's in 2007, when Jack Straw promised to tighten the law as a \"matter of urgency\", despite the fact that it wasn't urgent, and when it came to it (the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/contents\" title=\"\">Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008</a>), he merely codified it according to existing precedent, of which there was hardly any. The context for that was a Brownite regime that was petrified of tabloid sensibilities and had no confidence in its own ability to argue against them, as well as being atrophied by indecision over how best to play their honeymoon period. They were casting around to be as politically inclusive as reason would allow.</p> <p>But even if Straw had changed the law to allow self-defence right up to the point where it's \"grossly disproportionate\", I doubt it would have made any practical difference. Most people don't have a gun; most people haven't been in a fight since they were at primary school. When the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/News%20Release/lcj-press-conference-270912.pdf\" title=\"\">gave his opinion last month that the law was fine</a> as it stood, he remarked: \"I suspect if any of you have come home to find a burglar in your home, or have been in bed at night \u2013 or indeed having an afternoon snooze and found a burglar in your home \u2013 you are not calmly detached.\" Realistically, detachment aside, how fighting fit are you going to emerge from that snooze? What are the chances that your criminal opponent will be better at combat than you are?</p> <p>This is not a practical suggestion. It is no blueprint for the protection of private property, nor even a metaphorical iteration of the power balance between victim and criminal. It's a statement of individual power against the flim-flam of civilisation. \"We understand that society is all very well, but not if it comes at the price of being allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat.

  "<p>Conservatives on the US supreme court expressed strong doubts about affirmative action at the University of Texas on Wednesday in a case that could reshape 35 years of legal rulings on the use of racial preferences in education.</p> <p>A white woman, Abigail Fisher, is suing the university for discrimination after she said she was denied a college place because African American and Hispanic students were favoured in order to ensure diversity. Fisher's lawyers accused the University of Texas of \"blatant racial balancing\".</p> <p>The university said that Fisher is \"asking this court to move the goal posts on higher education in America \u2013 and overrule its precedent going back 35 years\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/09/texas-university-supreme-court-case\">Texas law allocates 75% of places at the university</a> to the best performing students in each state-run school. The remaining places are assigned by competition, in which race plays a part alongside other factors such as school grades, economic background and geography as the university says it attempts to create a diverse student body.</p> <p>Much of the questioning centred on how the University of Texas policy fits with a 2003 ruling in another case that has set the standard on the role race plays in admissions policy for the past decade. That ruling upheld the use of race as a factor in admissions policy to ensure a diverse student body, but said it cannot be the decisive component, and said quotas or a points system involving ethnicity are barred.</p> <p>Conservative justices pressed the university's lawyer, Greg Garre, to say at what point the university would reach a \"critical mass\" of minority students and no longer need racial preferencing. Garre said the university had no figure in mind. Some of the justices balked at that. Justice Anthony Kennedy said that Texas was arguing that race counts \"above all.\" </p> <p>Two of the more liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, suggested that Fisher did not have a case because she would have failed to gain a place at the University of Texas even if race had not been a factor, and that she has since graduated from another college.</p> <p>Fisher's lawyers said that she had suffered damage nonetheless.</p> <p>The university has strongly defended the benefits of diversity in the classroom. It is backed by other colleges that have filed briefs with the court, including Harvard and Yale, as well as big business interests, such as Microsoft and Walmart.</p> <p>The Obama administration also supports the University of Texas, saying there is a compelling national security interest in ensuring a wide variety of students graduate from university in part to meet the recruiting needs of the military, CIA and FBI.</p> <p>The US solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, backed the university's argument that race is only a contributory, not a deciding factor, in admissions.</p> <p>\"Race is not considered on its own, and it is never determinative of an applicant's admission by itself,\" Verrilli said. \"Rather, race is one of a number of contextual factors that provide a more complete understanding of the applicant's record and experiences. That is a far cry from impermissible racial balancing.\"</p> <p>The centre of gravity of the court has shifted further to the right since the 2003 ruling. Five years ago, four of the judges \u2013 John Roberts, the chief justice, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2013 put their names to an opinion that said: \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"</p> <p>The issue will be decided by eight justices after the ninth, Elena Kagan, recused herself because she had a hand in the case in her previous role as solicitor general.</p> <p>If Kennedy sides with the conservative view, that could lead to a radical change to the legal status of affirmative action. If the court divides evenly on the issue then the lower court ruling, which upheld the university's admissions policy, will stand.</p> <p>Scalia pushed back against the idea that a university's ethnic make-up should reflect the demographics of the state it is in.</p> <p>Statistics show Latinos are significantly under-represented at the University of Texas, while the proportion of white and African Americans students is broadly in line with the demographics of the state.</p> <p>The latest intake of students was 18.4% Hispanic, 49.8% white, 4.5% African American and 15.2% Asian American.</p> <p>According to the 2010 census, Hispanics make up 37.6% of Texas's 25 million residents. Whites account for 45.3% and African Americans 3.8%. Less than 1% are of Asian descent.</p> <p>One of the arguments advanced by Fisher's lawyers is that the university's admissions policy is a breach of the equal protection clause of the US constitution's 14th amendment, written after the civil war to overrule an 1857 supreme court decision that deprived black people of American citizenship. The equal protection clause was the basis for the supreme court's 1954 ruling, Brown v Board of Education, which initiated the desegregation of education.</p> <p>Now, Fisher's lawyers say, it is white people who are subject to racial discrimination.</p> <p>\"If any state action should respect racial equality, it is university admission,\" they said in a submission to the supreme court. \"Selecting those who will benefit from the limited places available at universities has enormous consequences for the future of American students and the perceived fairness of government action.\"</p> <p>But the Constitutional Accountability Centre, in its brief to the court, argues that the 14th amendment permits \"race-conscious measures to foster equality\".</p> <p>\"The text permits the government to use race to help realise equal protection under the law, and at the very same time, the framers of the 14th amendment enacted numerous race-conscious measures to help ensure equality,\" said the centre's civil rights director, David Gans.</p> <p>\"The 14th amendment came right after the civil war. Slavery was dismantled. There were efforts to integrate African Americans and to do so on the basis of equality, and the framers recognised you need to use race to help foster equality. The signature and most successful of those early race conscious measures were trying to ensure equality of education for African Americans.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's latest comments on abortion, which appeared to soften his pro-life stance, have reignited debate not just on his own apparently evolving beliefs on the issue, but also on the hardline anti-abortion views of his running mate, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>The Romney campaign has said it would not oppose abortion in cases of rape, a clear departure from contradicts Ryan who believes there should be no exceptions to a ban on abortion.</p> <p>Ryan was a co-sponsor of a controversial House bill last year defining life as the moment of fertilisation and granting \"personhood\" rights to embryos. Abortion rights activists say the Sanctity of Human Life Act would have outlawed all abortions without exceptions, restricted some forms of contraception, in-vitro fertilisation and stem-cell research.</p> <p>The bill never made it onto the floor of the House. All state attempts to introduce so-called \"personhood\" amendments into law have failed, even in conservative states.</p> <p>Ryan also voted for and co-sponsored a bill dubbed the \"let women die\" bill by pro-choice campaigners. It would allow hospitals to deny emergency abortions, even when it is necessary to save a woman's life.</p> <p>The Republican representative for Wisconsin has been one of the most active anti-abortion members of Congress, co-sponsoring 38 anti-abortion bills, including some that <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-22/ryan-opposition-to-abortion-consistent-with-akin-s-no-exceptions.html\">do not make exceptions for victims of rape</a>.</p> <p>Since first elected to the house in 1998, Ryan has not voted against any bills backed by the National Right to Life Committee. The group gives him a lifetime voting score of 100%.</p> <p>The tally by the abortion rights group, NARAL Pro-Choice America, on the other hand, have recorded Ryan as having voted on 59 occasions against abortion and other reproductive rights issues.</p> <p>He co-sponsored a measure that would require a woman seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound first. He also co-sponsored legislation that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks gestation in the District of Columbia, with no exceptions for rape or incest.</p> <p>A further two bills that he co-sponsored last year would have restricted the definition of rape. The bills sought to ban federal funds from being used for abortion, except in the case of \"forcible rape\". Use of the term \"forcible\" was criticised by Democrats and it was subsequently removed in an amendment.</p> <p>As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he drafted a budget blueprint that sought to end federal dollars for Title X, the national family-planning program.</p> <p>The difficulties for a Romney-Ryan ticket among women was highlighted in August when Ryan's extreme pro-life views were tied to those of Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri who was abandoned by the party after comments on \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Ryan told reporters at the time he was \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/paul-ryan-republican-abortion-row\">proud of my pro-life record</a>\" but said that Romney set the policy.</p>",
  "<p>Atos, the company contracted by the Department for Work and Pensions to carry out medical assessments of people claiming benefits, has subcontracted the NHS to carry out its consultations in Scotland in an unusual example of an outsourced contract being subcontracted back to a public organisation.</p> <p>The decision has prompted questions from MPs over whether it represents value for public money for the state to contract work to a private company, if the company then in turn outsources the work back to the state sector.</p> <p>Atos Healthcare has appointed the Scottish healthcare provider NHS Lanarkshire's occupational health arm, Salus, to help carry out assessments for a new disability benefit, the personal independence payment (Pip), which is due to replace the disability living allowance from 2013. The government aims to cut spending on the benefit by 20% over the next three years.</p> <p>Lanarkshire NHS will receive \u00a322m from Atos to carry out the work until July 2017. Atos won contracts worth more than \u00a3400m in August to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/02/atos-disability-benefit-tests\" title=\"\">test whether disabled claimants were eligible for the new benefit</a>.</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said Atos was receiving \u00a3238m for work in Scotland, north-east and north-west England, but said it was not possible to break down that figure to reveal the value of the Scottish contract.</p> <p>Atos Healthcare said: \"This is a new approach, working in partnership with NHS Lanarkshire. It means that consultations will take place where people feel most comfortable \u2013 in the heart of their local community \u2013 and they will be conducted by health practitioners that have first-class expertise in dealing with the needs of disabled people.\"</p> <p>Atos said the supply chain model in Scotland was likely to be similar to those soon to be announced in England, although contracts were still being finalised.</p> <p>Over the past three years, Atos has been carrying out work capability assessments for the DWP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jan/10/atos-wca-citizens-advice-right-first-time\" title=\"\">has been heavily criticised</a> by disability charities for the lack of sensitivity and accuracy shown by its assessors. Since the test was introduced in 2008, more than 600,000 people have appealed against the conclusions of Atos assessments.</p> <p>NHS Lanarkshire said it would be committed to ensuring that \"everyone assessed is treated with dignity and receives a professional service delivered in a compassionate and transparent manner\".</p> <p>Dr Alan McDevitt, chairman of the British Medical Association's Scottish general practitioners committee, said: \"There have been concerns raised about the dramatic increase in the numbers of patients being assessed as fit to work by Atos previously and a large number of successful appeals have been made against these decisions. Hopefully, we will see a reduction in the number of patients who feel that an unjust decision has been made.\"</p> <p>But there was concern from MPs whether the process of re-outsourcing a contract back to the state system involved making unnecessary payments to the middle tier.</p> <p>Anne McGuire, the shadow minister for disabilities, said: \"There are questions to be asked about the effectiveness of using a private sector intermediary between a public sector organisation and a public sector organisation. It is at least unusual. It begs the question, why DWP didn't contract direct to Salus?\"</p> <p>Tom Greatrex, the Rutherglen and Hamilton West Labour MP, asked: \"What cost is there to the public purse of government outsourcing to a private company, only for that same company to outsource the programme back to the public sector? It is time for the government to provide much needed clarity on what is already a chaotic and out of control system.</p> <p>\"This decision shows that Atos clearly recognises there is little trust in its ability to conduct assessments fairly.\"</p> <p>Margaret Lynch, chief executive of Citizens Advice Scotland said: \"Concerns have been expressed about whether this represents value for money, whether it will lead to a 'postcode lottery', and whether these assessments will repeat the flaws of those used for the ESA. We believe these are legitimate questions. We are also concerned that the UK government has imposed a 20% cut to the budget, and we would like to know how ATOS and these other agencies are sure they can deliver that before a single claimant has even been assessed.\"</p> <p>The DWP said: \"Atos were selected following open and fair competition and were assessed against established and published selection criteria including value for money. We think it's right that Atos will be working with local NHS services, which have roots in their local communities and will provide familiar surroundings for people who are going for consultations.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Spanish basketball team \"trashed their apartments\" after losing to the USA in the final and a Moroccan athlete took out a sprinkler system that crashed through several floors by playing with a remote control aircraft.</p> <p>But, all in all, London got away lightly in terms of damage to the Athletes Village traditionally incurred by host Olympic cities, according to the man responsible for putting it right.</p> <p>The Olympic Delivery Authority still has to complete \u00a3150m worth of work on the Olympic Village to make the apartments ready to be handed over to developers Qatari Diar and Delancey. But it is the London Legacy Development Corporation, of which the ODA chief executive, Dennis Hone, is also interim chief executive, that is taking up most of his time.</p> <p>Chiefly, the knotty question of what to do about the Olympic Stadium, amid ongoing negotiations with West Ham over the cost of the modifications the football club require. While football would attract large crowds on a regular basis, Hone said that, aside from the stadium conversion, there were also attendant costs in terms of the stewarding and transport considerations.</p> <p>\"We've had discussions with all of the bidders. The difficulty is that we're balancing the adaptations we have to make to the stadium against the proposals that have come in and the benefits \u2013 financial and otherwise \u2013 that those proposals bring. If it was a knockout [verdict] it would be an easy decision, but it's not,\" said Hone.</p> <p>The decision, which has already been subject to endless delays, could now be put back beyond the deadline of the end of the month. Once the main tenants have been decided, a stadium operator will be appointed to manage a programme of concerts and other sporting events around the 20 days of athletics and community use already guaranteed.</p> <p>Some at City Hall believe that, with the already iconic stadium having proved its worth as a concert and sporting venue during the Olympics, the LLDC should press on without football. But others, including the London mayor, Boris Johnson, believe that West Ham still offer the most sustainable long-term solution while wanting to ensure that the deal is beneficial to taxpayers.</p> <p>Hone, dismissed West Ham's concerns that the stadium would not feel like their own. \"You've got Milan and Inter. You've got Lazio and Roma,\" he said. \"They can dress the stadium between games so that everyone feels like it's their home ground. That's absolutely doable.\"</p> <p>But aside from that pressing issue, which has dogged discussions about the Olympic legacy since before the bid was made, Hone is keen to emphasise the progress that has been made in planning for the future of a Park through which more than 10m ticketholders passed during both Games.</p> <p>Hone was parachuted in as the chief executive of the LLDC&#xa0;following the controversial ousting of his predecessor, Andrew Altman, who together with the former chair, Margaret Ford, conceived the 20-year masterplan on which the development is based.</p> <p>Daniel Moylan, who removed Altman and appointed Hone, has after a matter of months himself been given a new job overseeing the mayor's aviation policy, while Johnson has taken on the chairman's role.</p> <p>Hone defends the changes by saying the organisation is moving into delivery mode, as it seeks to ensure the north of the Park, which contains the velodrome,&#xa0;reopens by 27 July next year and the more urban south plaza, which contains the stadium, is next the following summer.</p> <p>\"The organisation is moving from a phase of planning to one of delivery. You've got \u00a3300m of transformational works, you've got park opening dates you really need to hit, you're moving into coordination of events mode,\" said Hone, who is expected to be appointed on a full-time basis in due course.</p> <p>\"If I'm appointed as permanent chief executive, there'll be some changes. But the last thing I'm going to do is wholesale change to an organisation that has been relatively successful and probably underappreciated.\"</p> <p>The understated Hone is already planning the works that will remove the main Stratford Gate bridge, across which millions of people streamed during the Games, so that the cranes can move in and begin dismantling the temporary stands either side of Zaha Hadid's Aquatics Centre.</p> <p>Hone insists that the Park, which will eventually contain 8,000 houses, will have sport at its heart in much the same way as the 1951 Festival of Britain left behind a cultural legacy on London's South Bank.</p> <p>\"This is the Olympics so the legacy has to be sport. We want a full offer of different things but sport has got to be one of the key things. At Eton Manor you'll have hockey, tennis and football. You've got four forms of cycling, you've got the multi-use arena, you've got the Aquatics Centre coming on-stream,\" said Hone. \"Then you've got the stadium. The primary offer is sport. That covers all ages and all abilities, from elite athletes to disability sport and those people we want to inspire to get off their sofa.\"</p> <p>The LLDC, which will meet next week to try to edge the stadium saga closer to a conclusion, has found permanent tenants for seven of the eight venues on the Park, which will be called the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.</p> <p>\"When we open next year, the Mayor might give the impression it will be like Disney. It won't be, it will be much more about events on the Park, such as [the cycling festival] RideLondon. I want to get the message out there that the Park will unfold in stages,\" said Hone. \"The north area of the Park is a much more tranquil area and my worry is that everyone will expect it to be like the Olympics every day. That was a once-in-a-lifetime period.\"</p> <p>Hone insists that, despite the difficult decision over the stadium bequeathed him by his predecessors and caused by a lack of foresight at the beginning of the process, he was happy with the \"route map\" that had been left behind.</p> <p>\"It would be terrible if you didn't have a route map and didn't have a plan. We do. We have to be open-minded, just like any other quarter of London. We want to have the flexibility for new things to happen. London is never finished, it never will be.\"</p> <h2>Venue vexation</h2>",
  "<p>When Joe Biden was last seen on a national debate stage four years ago, it was put to him by the moderator Gwen Ifill that his perceived weakness was lack of discipline. \"You're very kind suggesting my only achilles heel is my lack of discipline,\" the then-senator replied. \"Others talk about my excessive passion.\"</p> <p>On Thursday night, as he steps in front of the TV cameras in Danville, Kentucky, to face his vice-presidential rival Paul Ryan, he will need to overcome both impediments and display discipline combined with great, though not excessive, passion. The stakes are high: in the wake of Barack Obama's own debate appearance last week the president's poll ratings have taken a nose-dive and the Romney-Ryan ticket has been reinvigorated.</p> <p>It falls now to Biden, a politician who, as vice-president, has spent much of the past four years out of the limelight, to deliver the performance of his political career. \"He has to reframe the debate,\" said Darrell West, a specialist in government and media at the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>\"Obama's poor showing allowed Mitt Romney to completely recast his record, and the Democrats can't afford that to happen again. I expect Biden to be aggressive in pointing out the differences between the two campaigns over the major issues.\"</p> <p>For the past three days, Biden, 69, has been sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, in intensive debate prep with a team of advisers led by David Axelrod, Obama's chief re-election strategist. Biden has been rehearsing alongside Maryland congressman Chris Van Hollen, who has been role-playing Ryan, and has been thoroughly mugging up on his opponent's policy positions including a close textual analysis of the book co-written by Ryan: Young Guns.</p> <p>The implication is clear: Biden will move heaven and earth not to repeat Obama's mistakes of last week in which the president was deemed to have been too passive in his encounter with Romney. \"He's going to be very attuned to any attempt by Ryan to present himself as more moderate than he is,\" West said.</p> <p>The need for Biden to exploit the contradictions in his opponent's positions \u2013 in a way that Obama failed to do with Romney \u2013 is clearly on the minds of top aides. Jennifer Psaki, press secretary of the Obama re-election campaign, told a gaggle of reporters on Air Force One this week that \"the question here is: which Paul Ryan is going to come to the debate later this week? Is it going to be the Paul Ryan who has been misleading about everything from his marathon time to details and specifics he included in his convention speech?</p> <p>\"Or is it going to be the Paul Ryan who has eagerly embraced voucherizing Medicare and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires? We'll all be watching.\"</p> <p>Robert Barnett, the doyen of debate prep coaches, who has held the hands of Democratic candidates in no fewer than eight presidential races since 1976 and is part of the Obama-Biden prep team this year, said the focus on substantial policy differences is always ultimately more important than the one-line zinger or the gaffe. Barnett points out that the most famous soundbite of any VP debate \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-7gpgXNWYI\">\"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\"</a> \u2013 was delivered against Dan Quayle by Lloyd Bentsen who, despite that exocet remark, went on to lose with Michael Dukakis the 1988 election.</p> <p>Barnett also points out that in last week's debate between Romney and Obama \"there was a clear contrast in major issues and not a lot of focus on one-liners. I think that makes for a better debate, when the discussion is substantive.\"</p> <p>With that in mind, Biden is unlikely to repeat Obama's inexplicable failure to raise the Romney's record at Bain Capital, the asset management firm he set up, and the Republican nominee's <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/09/romney-secret-video-marc-leder-sex-parties\">notorious comments about the dependent 47% of Americans</a>. And there will be plenty to go at in terms of the record of his immediate opponent.</p> <p>As an avowed policy wonk who refers to himself as a \"PowerPoint guy\", Ryan, 42, brings to the debate a wealth of policy formulations that give him impressive Beltway credentials but leave him exposed to Democratic attack.</p> <p>Top of the pile is the Paul Ryan budget, which runs counter to Romney's claim last week that he intends to leave unchanged taxes for the most wealthy Americans. Ryan's budget, by contrast, calls for a tax cut for the super rich to 25% and an effective increase in taxes for the most poor by removing tax breaks for low-income earners.</p> <p>Then there's Medicare, the national healthcare insurance scheme for over-65s, which Ryan has proposed essentially to privatise for anyone under 55. He's been similarly bold in his thinking about Medicaid, the national health insurance scheme for poor families, drawing up plans that independent analysts have suggested would lead to the slashing of the Medicaid budget by a third over the next decade.</p> <p>West expects Biden, in addition, to raise Ryan's controversial views on abortion \u2013 another area in which the running mate sits uneasily with the new, moderate Romney that was unveiled in Denver last week. All Biden has to do is point out that Ryan backed legislation that would grant a fertilised egg the full legal rights of a person, and that his co-sponsor of the bill was none other than Todd Akin, the Missouri Republican who in August astonished the world with his statement that women who had been \"legitimately\" raped rarely got pregnant.</p> <p>\"The abortion issue is a good way for Biden to reach out to women voters who are wavering in their support for Obama,\" West said.</p> <p>One thing that Biden cannot assume, however, is that Ryan will be taken off guard by questions surrounding his positions. Though inexperienced in national debating, the Wisconsin congressman has been engaged for days in his own deep debate prep and has said he is braced for Biden going on the offensive. \"I expect the vice-president to come at me like a cannonball,\" <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/paul-ryan-readies-debate-biden_653713.html\">he told the conservative Weekly Standard</a>.</p> <p>It all makes for a potentially barnstorming debate after the rather drab presidential affair last week. Joe Biden has achilles heels aplenty, but being dull is not one of them.</p>",
  "<p>Germany blocked the proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a325bn) merger between BAE Systems and EADS after deciding that the UK and France were getting too great a share of benefits from the deal \u2013 and Berlin was getting too little.</p> <p>According to sources close to the transaction the position of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, hardened in the 24 hours leading up to Wednesday's decision to abandon the deal, even though Paris and London had come close to a consensus that would have allowed both companies to continue with merger discussions.</p> <p>Merkel's opposition shocked all parties, coming as optimism grew that a deal could be struck. EADS said: \"No firm reason has been given for the German government's opposition.\"</p> <p>A source close to the talks said that with three days to go before the Takeover Panel's put-up-or-shut-up deadline, BAE and EADS were 90% certain that enough progress had been made to seek an extension to the deadline which would have allowed negotiations to continue. However, Merkel balked at a perceived lack of German influence in the industrial behemoth that would be created by the combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the Franco-German owner of Airbus.</p> <p>One of the key sticking points was the plan to establish the head office of the new company at the Airbus base in Toulouse and site the defence headquarters of the company in the UK. A demand that the corporate HQ be located in Munich was lodged by Merkel's adviser in intergovernmental talks on Friday.</p> <p>\"It became clear that the German government position was not supportive,\" said the source. \"Partly, that was because the defence business was going to be based in the UK and the overall headquarters would be at Airbus in France. The German government was left saying 'what is in it for me?'\"</p> <p>Appointing a German national \u2013 EADS chief executive Tom Enders \u2013 as boss of the new company did not assuage deeper concerns about the 50,000 EADS employees in Germany. \"In the longer term there was a concern about industrial, hi-tech jobs going out of Germany, and the level of influence of that Germany would have had.\"</p> <p>BAE's chairman, Dick Olver, told the Guardian that the politics factor had always made the chances of success no greater 50/50. But, he said, the prize of creating a manufacturing powerhouse with 220,000 employees, spanning tanks to airliners, made it a gamble worth taking. \"The upside was worth the risk,\" he said.</p> <p>In the end the politics proved insurmountable. Concerns over government influence centred on the size of French and German state shareholdings in the new business. France and Germany control 22.35% each of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings and Merkel was concerned that this power would be eroded by the deal.</p> <p>The UK government, in turn, owns a golden share in BAE that allowed it to limit foreign investment in the business. France's state holding company would have emerged with a 9% shareholding in the new business \u2013 the same as Germany's \u2013 but the Merkel government was concerned that the French state might increase its stake by acquiring the 7.5% shareholding in EADS owned by French media and retail conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re.</p> <p>With 24 hours to go before the deadline to reveal the details of the deal, France and the UK were close to reaching agreement, but Germany remained opposed. \"Over the last 24 hours it seemed like the British and French government had got to a good place,\" and there were hopes that Berlin could then be persuaded to ask the Takeover Panel for an extension to its deadline of 5pm. Instead, said the person familiar with the talks, \"it became a case of having the French and British on one page and the Germans on a second page.\" The plug had to be pulled.</p> <p>In France, the finger was also being pointed at Berlin. A source close to the negotiations told French journalists: \"It didn't work because the Germans blocked it.\"</p> <p>Merkel's opposition, however, had not emerged suddenly. In a bid to keep the merger talks top-secret, BAE and EADS and their advisers had briefed the UK, French and German governments at the highest levels when they opened discussions in July. Merkel was involved from the start. A source close to EADS said the talks had been showing substantial progress, which left both sides \"surprised\" at the final outcome. \"Common sense was breaking out all over the place,\" said the source, referring to the rising hopes of a talks extension in recent days. \"But we just did not get German consent. And we still don't know why.\"</p> <p>A German government spokesman brushed off attempts to blame Germany for the collapse of the deal. He said the aerospace and defence group would not be affected by the merger collapse and stressed that both companies could continue to co-operate as before, including their partnership in the Typhoon eurofighter project.</p> <p>\"The government supports the already existent co-operation of both companies and has complete trust in the business leadership of EADS,\" Seibert said. Peter Hintze the government's co-ordinator for aerospace who has long voiced his opposition to a merger, told Spiegel Online: \"The strength of the companies lies precisely in the close cooperation between the Germans and the French.\"</p>",
  "<p>'I had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taliban.\" So began the diary of Malala Yousafzai, an 11-year-old girl living in Pakistan's Swat region in 2009 while the Taliban had de facto control and female education was banned. The BBC website published the diary, and a few months later a New York Times documentary revealed more about the girl behind the pen.</p> <p>Today, as Malala Yousafzai remains critical but stable <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19882799\" title=\"\">in hospital following an assassination attempt by the Taliban</a>, I watched the laughing, wise, determined 11-year-old in that video and thought of the Urdu phrase, \"<em>kis&#xa0;mitti kay banee ho</em>\" \u2013 \"from what clay were you fashioned?\"</p> <p>It's an expression that changes meaning according to context. Sometimes, as when applied to Malala Yousafzai, it's a compliment, alluding to a person's exceptional qualities. At other times it indicates some element of humanity that's missing. From what clay were you fashioned, I'd like to say to the TTP (the Pakistan Taliban), in a tone quite different to that in which I'd direct it to the 14-year-old girl they shot \"because of her pioneering role in preaching secularism and so-called enlightened moderation\" and who, according to their spokesman, they intend to target again.</p> <p>The truth is both Malala Yousafzai and the Taliban were fashioned from the clay of Pakistan. When I say this about Malala it is not in a statement of patriotism about my homeland but instead an echo of a sentiment expressed by the novelist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadeem_Aslam\" title=\"\">Nadeem Aslam</a>: \"Pakistan produces people of extraordinary bravery. But no&#xa0;nation should ever require its citizens to be that brave.\"</p> <p>Because the state of Pakistan allowed the Taliban to exist, and to grow in strength, Malala Yousafzai couldn't simply be a schoolgirl who displayed courage in facing down school bullies but one who, instead, appeared on talk shows in Pakistan less than a year ago to discuss the possibility of her own death at the hands of the Taliban.</p> <p>\"Sometimes I imagine I'm going along and the Taliban stop me. I take my sandal and hit them on the face and say what you're doing is wrong. Education is our right, don't take it from us. There is this quality in me \u2013 I'm ready for all situations. So even if (God let this not happen) they kill me, I'll first say to them, what you're doing is wrong.\"</p> <p>It's only right to acknowledge that&#xa0;if&#xa0;different decisions had been made about&#xa0;Pakistan's history, primarily&#xa0;by those within the country but also by those outside it, the men issuing statements justifying assassination attempts on a young girl&#xa0;would also have been&#xa0;doing something else with&#xa0;their lives.</p> <p>It isn't the clay from which they were&#xa0;fashioned, but the patch of earth in&#xa0;which they grew up which made them what they now are. But what do we do with this piece of information? Yes, of course, the Taliban exists because of political decisions dating back to the 1980s; and of course the mess that is the \"war on terror\" has only&#xa0;added to the TTP's ranks.</p> <p>There's no need for the Taliban to invent propaganda against the American&#xa0;and Pakistan state (although they do) \u2013 both governments supply an excess of recruitment material for those&#xa0;who hate them. So if you view the Taliban simply through the prism of the war on terror and Pakistan and the United States, it's possible to think the process can be reversed; policies can be changed; everyone can stop being murderous and&#xa0;duplicitous.</p> <p>But then there's Malala Yousafzai, standing in for all the women attacked, oppressed, condemned by the Taliban. What role have women played in creating the Taliban? Which of their failures is tied to the Taliban's strength? What grave responsibility, what terrible guilt do they carry around which explains the reprisals against them?</p> <p>For political differences, seek political&#xa0;solutions. But what do you do in the face of an enemy with a pathological hatred of woman? What is it that you're saying if you say (and I do, in this case) there can be no starting point for negotiations? I believe in due process of law; I know violence begets violence. But as I keep clicking my Twitter feed for updates on Malala Yousafzai's condition, and find instead one statement after another from the government, political parties, and the army (writing in capital letters) condemning the attack, I find myself thinking, do any of you know the way forward? Today, I'm unable to see it. But Malala, I'm sure, would tell me I'm wrong. Let her wake up, and do that.</p>",
  "<p>A hi-tech fingerprint scanner unlocks the entrance to Jean Gatabazi's offices at the hospital in the Rwandan town of Nyamata. Gatabazi says the past five years have brought a tarmac road, street lighting and thriving businesses to the site of one of the worst massacres of the 1994 genocide. And he knows whom he credits for the transformation. \"Paul Kagame is an excellent man,\" he says proudly. \"Hero is the right word.\"</p> <p>President Kagame has similarly mesmerised Tony Blair (who called him a \"visionary leader\"), Bill Clinton (\"one of the greatest leaders of our time\"), Clare Short (\"such a sweetie\") and Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, who was persuaded to invest here. Such idolatry raises the question, what spell does this flinty statesman with bookish, even nerdy looks, with no obvious charisma, cast over western leaders \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/25/paul-kagame-rwanda-us-britain\" title=\"\">why is it now wearing thin</a>?</p> <p>Everything in Rwanda must be seen through the prism of the genocide, a hundred apocalyptic days that wiped out 800,000 men, women, children and babies and left no family unscarred. As a guerrilla commander who marched from the bush to the capital, Kigali, it was Kagame who ended the nightmare and, his champions say, tilted the scales more towards reconciliation than revenge. \"I'm not sure Rwanda would exist if not for him right now,\" one expat businessman said.</p> <p>At first glance, it is not hard to see why visitors are seduced by Kagame's Rwanda. Whatever post-traumatic disorders have been buried in the collective unconscious over 18 years, on the surface, life is orderly, pavements are clean and roads are free from the potholes that curse much of Africa. Kigali is nurturing a reputation as the safest city on the continent. American aid workers, entrepreneurs and tourists have poured in to a version of Africa that is both user-friendly and authentic.</p> <p>In the past decade, primary school attendance has trebled, child mortality has halved and parliament has achieved the highest proportion of female members in the world. Last week saw the opening of the <a href=\"http://www.kigalilibrary.org\" title=\"\">country's first public library</a>, its generous windows looking out directly on the US embassy. Kagame's wife, Jeannette, took a tour of the airy $3.5m (\u00a32.2m) building and heard from articulate 12-year-olds enjoying the fastest growing <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/map/rwanda\" title=\"\">One Laptop Per Child</a> project in Africa.</p> <p>It is no wonder that Rwanda is held up as a prime example of how donor support can work, proving a handy riposte to the aid sceptics who would slash the department for international development's budget. Kagame, 54, has been seen as a visionary, the face of a new, self-confident, economically vibrant African narrative that buries the passivity and victimhood of the past.</p> <p>In addition, some say, this might go some way to paying off western guilt over failing to intervene during the genocide. \"Clinton and Blair may be looking back to their time in the 90s and thinking, 'What could we have done differently, how can we put it right?'\" one observer remarked.</p> <p>But in recent years, there has been a slow, sickening realisation that the west's favourite African leader comes with a sinister edge. Kagame's Rwanda, say critics, is an authoritarian state where democracy and human rights are trampled upon and dissenters are hunted down. When Kagame won the 2010 election with 93% of the vote, for example, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/jul/18/paul-kagame-rwanda-profile\" title=\"\">three major opposition parties were excluded from the ballot</a>. Two of their leaders were jailed and still languish there today.</p> <p>The third, Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green party, was also arrested briefly then went into exile after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/14/rwanda-opposition-politician-found-dead\" title=\"\">his deputy, Andr\u00e9 Kagwa Rwisereka, was found dead</a>, nearly decapitated. \"It broke our hearts,\" recalled Habineza, who returned home last month after two years in Sweden. \"He was a man who came to our house to share a meal and was close to my family. It was a terrible death. I went to the mortuary to dress him for the burial. It was an intimate moment. It shattered us but we have to pull ourselves together.\"</p> <p>Habineza, who received death threats after breaking away from Kagame's ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), feels frustrated at international donors' failure to push for genuine democracy. \"I requested Britain and others to take action regarding political space in Rwanda, but what they are doing, I don't understand. If the international community took a stand on political space and democracy, that would be the most helpful to us.\"</p> <p>Habineza welcomed the work of Blair's <a href=\"http://www.africagovernance.org/africa/pages/rwanda\" title=\"\">African Governance Initiative in Rwanda</a>, but added: \"I ask him to always request President Kagame to look at these issues: democracy and economic development go hand in hand. We are saying Rwanda is ready for democracy. Tony Blair should tell him this. There cannot be democracy in a country where there is no opposition party and no freedom of expression.\"</p> <p>In the past few years, several journalists have been arrested or killed, an exiled general survived a shooting in Johannesburg, and Scotland Yard warned two Rwandans living in Britain that \"the Rwandan government poses an imminent threat to your life\". A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/rwandan-civilians-claim-torture\" title=\"\">report this week by Amnesty International</a> identified a series of unlawful detentions and torture including electric shocks. Coincidence? Kagame's government insists the incidents must be examined one by one. His critics join the dots and find a pattern that includes state-sponsored death squads.</p> <p>Jean Baptiste Icyitonderwa, general secretary of Social Party Imberakuri, claims its leader has been tortured in jail. \"As a person in an opposition party, you can't trust your own security,\" he said. \"Many times you hear some leader of the opposition parties got arrested, killed and some others disappeared, others are persecuted. That means no one who belongs to an opposition party can feel safe.\"</p> <p>Boniface Twagirimana, vice-president of the United Democratic Forces party, whose leader is also behind bars, said: \"President Kagame is a dictator. He's operating like he's still in the forest as a rebel. He's not a president for the whole country, only RPF members. He doesn't want to open the political space to allow freedom of expression.\"</p> <p>Kagame has pledged to step down in 2017, the end of his second term. But Twagirimana is doubtful. \"Maybe they will change the constitution so he can continue. I think he would like to rule for 20, 30, 50 years like Robert Mugabe.\"</p> <p>Some observers argue that the RPF government is torn between a faction of military hardliners, who regard repression as a small price to pay for post-genocide peace between Hutus and&#xa0;Tutsis, and a more liberal wing sensitive to democratic concerns. Kagame, the military man turned statesman, faces a constant battle to balance the&#xa0;two.</p> <p>He recently responded to critics of restrictions on free speech by invoking Holocaust denialism. \"They are mainly talking about laws related to genocide ideology, which I am more than happy to defend,\" he told the US Metro newspaper. \"<a href=\"http://www.metro.us/newyork/international/article/1150774--exclusive-interview-paul-kagame-president-of-rwanda\" title=\"\">Rwandans will not tolerate voices that promote a return to the ethnic divisionism that precipitated the genocide 18 years ago</a>. To that extent, we place limits on freedom of expression in a similar way to how much of Europe has made it a crime to deny the Holocaust. Aside from that, Rwanda is a very open and free country.\"</p> <p>Kagame's government claims the west should not impose its own notions of democracy on Africa. His supporters include Gerald Mpyisi, managing director of the Institute of Management and Leadership, who said: \"The president is running the country like a CEO of a company who ensures that every director is accountable for their department. That is why, despite the lack of resources, you still find things happening.</p> <p>\"I believe for a country in the third world to develop there has to be a certain element of organising the population. The west tries to use its standards in the developing world and it isn't fair.\"</p> <p>If Rwanda had remained a kind of African Singapore, the west might have continued to turn a blind eye. But this year, it seems, the mask has finally slipped. In June, UN monitors accused Kagame of meddling in his mineral-rich neighbour the Democratic Republic of the Congo, supporting a rebellion led by a war crimes suspect and blamed for atrocities including mass rapes. Evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch supports the claim, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/congo-warlord-rwanda-kagame-defies-un\" title=\"\">which Rwanda fiercely denies</a>.</p> <p>International donors finally had no choice but to rap Kagame on the knuckles. His domestic opponents now want them to go further. Twagirimana said: \"The money given by the UK should be stopped. It is being used to run the army and fund the campaign in Congo. In a country without a democratic system, it is not difficult to use the money how you want. That is why the money is being used to kill people in Congo and Britain should stop its support.\"</p> <p>Human Rights Watch is a constant thorn in Kagame's side. Its researcher Carina Tertsakian was in effect expelled from Rwanda before the last election. \"Paul Kagame is a figure that seems to fascinate people,\" she said. \"He's been very clever and western governments have been very gullible in buying it and ignoring the violations and abuses. But by 2010 even the British government had to acknowledge things were not quite right. We are now seeing the Rwandan PR machine come unstuck.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are certain words that offend people. I learned a long time ago to avoid them. \"Sexual politics\", for instance, is better than rusty old \"feminism\". It's box-fresh sexy sex. It could be about vajazzling or threesomes or blowjobs; it could contain sex and therefore lighten the load of having to read a whinge.</p> <p>But the word I avoid the most is \"patriarchy\" as it suggests a conscious conspiracy by men to make women suffer. This is not what it means, actually, but I realised this when Hopi Sen, a fellow Orwell prize judge, used it to me of George Galloway's latest rant about the \"moral repugnance\" of women having abortions. George Galloway and moral repugnance in the same sentence: whoever would have thought it? But, said Hopi despairingly (we were talking on Twitter), what with Jimmy Savile too, this week it feels as if we are seeing the face of patriarchy.</p> <p>Indeed. \"The patriarchy\" \u2013 nameless and shameless but coming to a town near you in its endless tour of misery.</p> <p>The revelations about Savile and the culture that kept so many silent are not new to anyone who has listened to women. The idea that abortion \u2013 the right to control one's own body \u2013 is but a plaything for male politicians, such as Jeremy Hunt, to signal their credentials is not new. A community-service sentence for domestic violence (Justin Lee Collins) is not new. Depressingly, domestic violence campaigners have said many women never get such \"justice\" at all. The continuing support of the hard but impotent left for Julian Assange and their dismissal of the women concerned is not new. Women's rights have rarely been a priority for \"revolutionaries\".</p> <p>All of these things occur in a system \u2013 patriarchy \u2013 that is often as bad for some men as it is for women; a system that works in conjunction with capitalism. Kate Milett's definition remains useful: patriarchal institutions maintain a situation \"whereby that half of the populace which is female is controlled by that half which is male\". Men not only dominate women, elder men dominate their youngers. Patriarchy is not a conspiracy but a construct to explain how society organises itself and could therefore change. Matriarch, I note, has now become almost a term of abuse when used about Angela Merkel.</p> <p>In this deeply conservative era, patriarchal displays are obligatory. Hence the new \"tradition\" of each party leader producing a mute but glamorous wife for a postcoital glow after a speech. The sick joke of David Cameron and his talk of not being here to defend privilege but to spread it \u2013 please, if any Tory tries to spread anything near me I may shoot them down as a potential burglar \u2013 is that, of course, he and his colleagues cannot even properly name their privilege. They may acknowledge their poshness but not their masculinity. That is their wives' job.</p> <p>Such privilege entitles men such as Cameron to think that legislating over the bodies of women and patronising the poor is OK. It is this same entitlement that lets judges treat domestic violence leniently. It is this privilege that means many young girls fall pray to abusers. Those who knew of Savile and did nothing, men and women, were scared of what exactly? It is hard to challenge a privilege that is unspoken and that is why I am speaking here about patriarchy. Cameron and his cronies may have just been \"born this way\", but when they could choose to be on the side of women they simply haven't.</p> <p>The power of calling out abuse, though, is cheering. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/09/julia-gillard-tackle-sexism\" title=\"\">rousing speech by Julia Gillard</a>, the Australian prime minsiter, has gone viral. Her anger is raw. Watch as the leader of the opposition shrinks before her: \"I was offended when the leader of the opposition stood next to a sign that described me as a man's bitch. I was offended by these things. Misogyny, sexism, every day from the leader of the opposition.\" Gillard has been called a witch, a bitch and told that her father died of shame for her politics. It's almost impossible to imagine a woman making this speech in the House of Commons. She would be drowned out by jeers.</p> <p>For even the \"modernisers\" wear their political droit de seigneur with ease. Equality is a great \"idea\" but feminism remains a joke of the hilarious Harriet Harperson kind. The mantra of meritocracy means more of exactly the same: no more women in public life, no acknowledgment that men need to up their game.</p> <p>The reduction of feminism to a \"chattering class\" issue is absolutely part of the rightwing agenda. Only certain women can \"afford\" to be concerned and this is exactly the dead end of Tory feminism, which is strong on the right to have it all and totally blind to women who have very little. But open your eyes to see that the fight for women's rights remains real and globalised. Working-class boys have died in Afghanistan on the pretext of improving the rights of women, remember? A 14-year-old in Pakistan, Malala Yousafzai, has been shot in the head at close range because she wants an education. We admire this fight for basic rights as we talk to the Taliban.</p> <p>We are not in the same situation but the rights that women assume here \u2013 not to be abused or raped, to \"aspire\" to equal representation in public life and at work \u2013 are being chivvied way. We have a judicial and political system that is allowing this to happen and we cannot challenge it if we cannot name it. These words \u2013 patriarchy, feminism, misogyny \u2013 are indeed old. Retro, even. But they are vintage concepts, pre-loved because they are the real thing. Use when necessary.</p>",
  "<p>For the naval officers lounging onboard the Argentinian naval vessel ARA Libertad, there could perhaps be worse places to be stranded than the bustling port of Tema, on Ghana's Atlantic coast.</p> <p>But the crew of the three-masted ship may be forced to prolong their stay indefinitely amid a legal dispute between the government of Argentina and a US-based \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vulture-funds\" title=\"\">vulture fund</a>\".</p> <p>The Ghanaian high court will on Thursday begin hearing a case to determine whether the Libertad is allowed to sail on, or forced to stay in Tema until the Argentinian government pays up $1.6bn claimed by US-based investment fund NML Capital.</p> <p>The fund \u2013 backed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/15/vulture-funds-key-players\" title=\"\">US billionaire Paul Singer</a> \u2013 is suing Argentina on the basis of debts arising from the country's defaulted bond swaps in 2005 and 2010. NML Capital bought bonds from the heavily indebted Argentinian government in 2000, a year before the country's $100bn sovereign default saw most of its debt restructured.</p> <p>The Libertad was detained after the fund \u2013 which has obtained judgments in New York and London awarding it more than $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) from Argentina \u2013 applied to the Ghanaian courts. Previous attempts to seize sovereign assets, including the Argentinian presidential jet, have so far been successfully avoided.</p> <p>\"NML already have five judgments against Argentina, but the problem is you get judgment but there are no assets to enforce it,\" a source close to the case told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"So the lawyers chose Ghana because Argentina had the Libertad \u2013 an asset within the jurisdiction.\"</p> <p>\" Argentina is not even flying its presidential plane anywhere until it has the assurance of the destination country that they are not going to seize it at the request of NML.\"</p> <p>The case has reignited criticism of international investors like Singer, who buy up foreign debt default. Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez often lashes out at funds like NML, describing them as \"vultures\" preying on debtor countries.</p> <p>\"The vulture funds have crossed a new line in their attack against Argentina,\" said the foreign ministry in a statement, pledging to \"clear up this hoax staged by unscrupulous financiers\".</p> <p>Although Argentina has little trade with Ghana and no embassy there, the two nations have \u2013 until now \u2013 had friendly ties.</p> <p>\"The Fragata Libertad was visiting the port of Tema upon the official invitation of the government of Ghana,\" said Arturo Antonio Puricelli, Argentinian minister of defence, in a written statement filed before the Ghana high court. Argentina argues the action is a breach of warship immunity under international law, and is expected to argue that the Libertad should be immediately released.</p> <p>\"The annual voyages around the world of the Libertad serve the important role of promoting goodwill relations between the republic and other nations like Ghana,\" said Puricelli. \"Any delays in leaving the port of Tema will jeopardise this official schedule and put at risk the training voyage and mission.\"</p> <p>This is not the first time Singer has clashed with a debt-ridden South American economy. The 68-year-old founder of a $19bn hedge fund called Elliott Management hit the headlines in the late 1990s when he bought debt that Peru had defaulted on for $11.4bn and took the country to court demanding full payment. After a hard-fought legal battle Singer emerged the victor with a $58m payoff.</p> <p>In another case Elliott went after the government of Congo-Brazzaville, uncovering corruption during the court case that eventually forced the government to settle for an estimated $90m on debt for which Elliott paid less than $20m.</p> <p>But it was the financial crisis that made him. In 2006 Singer was warning that banks were creating \"radioactive\" investments from subprime mortgages and other investments that could trigger a global financial crisis. Elliott correctly made a bet that this would be the case, adding to a personal fortune now estimated to be over $1bn. Singer, a prominent backer of the Republican party, has donated $1m to Mitt Romney's election campaign.</p> <p>Ghanaians are also questioning their role in the saga, as the economic consequences of the Libertad's detention at Tema begin to be felt in the west African country.</p> <p>\"This is creating problems for us,\" said Lawrence Atumbine of the Ghana port and harbour authority. \"The berth the Libertad is occupying is where we handle local vessels to be offloaded. It is a very large vessel \u2013 104 metres \u2013 and we cannot use the berth whilst it is there.\"</p> <p>Naval officers on board the Libertad, which serves as a school ship in the Argentian navy, refused to comment on the case but expressed surprise at the court order detaining the ship.</p> <p>\"We are ambassadors and we stay here to build better relationships with the countries we visit,\" said Lu\u00eds Melic\u00e1n, chief of communications on board the Libertad.</p> <p>\"But we have been visiting lots of tourist sites whilst the ship is held in the port. We have been to hotel swimming pools and we have been going to the mall. It's not too bad for us.\"</p>",
  "<p>As politicians line up to accuse Rwanda of supporting the latest armed rebellion in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the militia at the centre of the storm continues to strengthen and expand its nascent political wing.</p> <p>In Rutshuru, the unofficial capital of the territory now controlled by Congolese insurrectionists M23, civilians and armed rebels mix uneasily in the streets while spokesmen answer journalists' queries about the new movement.</p> <p>The first question is invariably the same: is Rwanda supporting the rebellion?</p> <p>\"We have never received a single gun or bullet from Rwanda,\" said the military spokesman Vianney Kazarama, who would not be drawn on any questions regarding Congo's diminutive but powerful neighbour. Rwandan officials also flatly deny the accusations, which were made in a June report by the United Nations' group of experts on the Congo.</p> <p>Some in political circles are more eager to speak, however, vigorously defending Rwanda against charges of supplying M23 with recruits, weapons and ammunition. \"Why does any malaise in Congo always have to involve Rwanda?\" said Ali Musagara, head of youth mobilisation for M23. \"We are not Rwandans. The fact that nothing in DRC works: is that the fault of Rwanda? We have no army, corruption is endemic, there is bad governance, fraudulent elections; all that, too, is the fault of Rwanda? I don't think so. These are all Congolese problems and they must be resolved by the Congolese.\"</p> <p>Benjamin Mbonimpa, head of refugee repatriation, blames the problems on a lack of effective leadership from Congo's president, Joseph Kabila. In contrast, he praises Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, for guiding the country's recovery from the devastating genocide of 1994.</p> <p>\"Paul Kagame's leadership is very organised, focused and effective,\" said Mbonimpa. \"If the Congo had a charismatic leader like Kagame, I think we would be fortunate. But the Congolese people feel a powerful hatred for Kagame; they have a terrible reaction when they hear his name. We can't propose him to the Congolese population as a good example of the leadership we need.\"</p> <p>The rebels' evident respect for Kagame worries those who see M23 as a proxy force for Rwandan ambitions in eastern Congo. The Congolese who now live under M23 rule are certainly of this view, referring to the rebels as \"foreigners\".</p> <p>Musagara described as \"wise\" Kagame's recent refusal to join other national leaders in publicly condemning the M23 rebels, who are led by Bosco Ntaganda, indicted by the international criminal court.</p> <p>Musagara also praised Kagame and his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni, for pursuing a negotiated solution to the crisis. \"They are two wise presidents,\" he said. \"[Rwanda and Uganda] are our neighbours; they must encourage the Congolese government to talk to us because when there is unrest in your neighbour, your country is not stable either.\"</p> <p>Congo's government has made its first tentative moves towards negotiation, engaging indirectly with the M23 delegation that has been in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, awaiting talks for several weeks. \"We are negotiating via the Ugandan government,\" said M23's political leader, Bishop Jean-Marie Runiga, speaking from the city. \"We hope to have face-to-face talks soon. It's very frustrating. We have been waiting in Kampala for a long time.\"</p> <p>M23's leadership is made up of former fighters with the Rwanda-backed CNDP (National Congress for the Defence of the People) rebellion in Congo. A 2009 peace deal integrated them into the army and granted them a parallel chain of command and a lucrative smuggling racket into Rwanda. It was the threat to smash those networks that prompted these soldiers to revolt in April and May. They say they want the full implementation of the 2009 peace deal and will fight until they get what they want.</p> <p>In towns controlled by M23, many are sceptical about whether the Kampala talks will lead anywhere. When asked about a solution to the crisis, Musagara said Congo's president would decide how the rebellion ended. \"We're ready for anything,\" he said. \"If [Kabila] wants negotiations, we are ready for that; we are also ready if he wants war.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's campaign was in difficulty again on Wednesday over their candidate's position on abortion after a newspaper interview in which Romney said that legislation to restrict abortion was \"not part of my agenda\".</p> <p>After spending months reassuring conservative voters that he was staunchly against abortion, Romney appeared to soften that stance <a href=\"http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda\">in an interview with the Des Moines Register</a> on Tuesday. \"There is no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda,\" he said.</p> <p>Within hours of the comments being published, Romney's campaign insisted that he was against abortion, telling the conservative National Review Online that Romney \"would, of course, support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is proudly pro-life, and he will be a pro-life president,\" said his spokeswoman Andrea Saul in a statement.</p> <p>Romney's comments drew fire from both sides on Wednesday, with Democrats accusing him of playing politics and hiding his real beliefs to attract female voters, and conservatives reminding him of his federal responsibilities over what remains a controversial issue.</p> <p>His remarks to the Iowa newspaper were <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/10/1142538/-Romney-debates-himself-on-abortion\">initially seized on by Democrats</a> as evidence of a change of heart. On hearing them, Bill Clinton told a campaign rally of 2,000 supporters: \"I thought, 'Wow, here's old moderate Mitt. Where ya been, boy?'\"</p> <p>But by Wednesday, Obama's campaign team was trying to portray Romney not as a flip-flopper, but as someone who cannot be trusted to voice his true beliefs.</p> <p>Democrats said his statement contradicted his pledge to appoints supreme court justices who would overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1972 decision which confirmed a woman's federal right to abortion.</p> <p>Stephanie Cutter, the Obama campaign's deputy press secretary, told reporters: \"We're not saying that he's changed his mind on these issues. We're saying that he is trying to cover up his beliefs.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Every step of the way he has been anti-choice, against Roe v Wade.\"</p> <p>Reaction among conservatives to Romney's remarks was also critical. A comment piece in <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obamacare-provides-taxpayer-funding-elective-abortions_654076.html\">the conservative newspaper The Weekly Standard</a> on Wednesday titled \"Did Mitt Romney forget?\" suggested that he was \"mistaken\" and had simply not realised how many issues related to abortion funding he could influence.</p> <p>\"The issue here does not appear to be that Romney is backing off his stance on abortion \u2013 indeed, he says he will use an executive order to cut off funding to groups that perform abortion overseas,\" it read. \"But he is mistaken in thinking that there aren't issues related to abortion-funding are handled through the legislative process at the federal level.\"</p> <p>Romney's past commitments have included ensuring US laws reflect \"values of preserving life. He has previously promised to: support foetal pain legislation, which bans abortion after 20 weeks, on the much-debated basis that foetuses can feel pain at that stage; end public health funds for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortions; and support a decades-old ban on federal funds for abortions.</p> <p>He supports the reversal of Roe v Wade, but believes in exceptions for victims of rape and incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.</p> <p>Romney, who had been pro-choice as governor of Massachusetts, repeatedly asserted his anti-abortion credentials as he battled to win the Republican nomination. During a televised debate in Charleston on 19 January before the South Carolina primary, for example, he said: \"You can count on me as president of the United States to pursue a policy that protects the life of the unborn, whether here in this country or overseas. And I'll reverse the policies of this president.\"</p> <p>In his acceptance speech to the Republican convention in Tampa in August, he promised that as president he would \"protect the sanctity of life\".</p> <p>His position on abortion also came under the spotlight when he selected Paul Ryan as his running mate. The Wisconsin congressman is against abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. He has sponsored a series of bills that would either restrict abortion or access to contraception, or both.</p> <p>Rick Perry, the Texas governor and a staunch pro-life advocate, said he was untroubled by Romney's initial remarks. He said on Wednesday that he was confident Romney will appoint \"constitutionalists\" to the supreme court.</p> <p>\"I think the supreme court is where that issue will be decided, from the standpoint of how America's going \u2013 we'll have a supreme court decision, and that's where the focus will be,\" Perry said on CBS This Morning. \"He's said very clearly that he's going to put people who are constitutionalists on the supreme court.\"</p> <p>Romney's comments came as he sought to maintain his recent appeal to female voters in the closing stages of the presidential race. A poll by Pew this week found Romney neck-and-neck among women with Barack Obama, who has held an enormous advantage with this demographic.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's powerful military chief has put himself at the centre of a national outrage over the attempted murder of a 14-year-old girl who had dared to speak out against the Taliban.</p> <p>General Ashfaq Kayani, the army chief, flew to the bedside of Malala Yousafzai as she lay recovering in a military hospital in the city of Peshawar after a three-hour operation to remove a bullet lodged in her head when she was shot on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/taliban-pakistan-shoot-girl-malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">Yousafzai and at least two other girls were attacked as they sat on a school bus</a> waiting to return home after a mid-term examination at her school in Mingora, the major city in Swat, a picturesque valley three hours' drive from Islamabad. Her attackers had approached the vehicle and asked for Yousafzai by name before one of them opened fire.</p> <p>Her father, Ziaudduin Yousafzai, said doctors were encouraged by a CT scan taken after the operation. He said Malala, who is still unconscious, also moved her hand slightly after coming out of surgery.</p> <p>In a statement published online by the military, Kayani said Yousafzai was \"an icon of courage and hope\" and the attack showed \"how little regard they [the Taliban] have for human life and how low they can fall in their cruel ambition to impose their twisted ideology\".</p> <p>The statement added: \"Such inhuman acts clearly expose the extremist mindset the nation is facing.\"</p> <p>The attack is embarrassing for the army, which has made much of its 2009 efforts to crush what by then had been several years of creeping Taliban takeover of Swat.</p> <p>Many Swatis said the Yousafzai attack proved the situation was still parlous. \"Before this incident we were thinking that there is peace in our Swat,\" said Iqbal Hussain, one of Yousafzai's teachers. \"But now all people have the feeling that militants are living among us.\"</p> <p>However, Hussain said that the rest of the girls at the school remained \"high-spirited\" and anxious to return to classes now that the school is temporarily closed.</p> <p>Kayani's statement came amid condemnation from political parties, including a motion passed unanimously by MPs.</p> <p>Public fury seems to have built up as the country's rolling news channels devoted considerable attention to the story and the Taliban announced they would make another attempt on her life if she survived.</p> <p>Perhaps conscious of what one media pundit described as a \"major PR disaster\" for the Taliban, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) circulated a lengthy statement that tried to justify the assassination with references to Islamic history and the Qur'an.</p> <p>It said that although the TTP did not believe in attacking women, it was obliged to kill anyone \"whosever leads campaign against Islam and sharia\" and that her main crime was \"because of her pioneer role in preaching secularism and so-called enlightened moderation\".</p> <p>It also said that Yousafzai had been guilty of inviting Muslims to hate the <em>mujahideen</em>, as the insurgents style themselves.</p> <p>Yousafzai, who won Pakistan's first peace prize for her efforts, did indeed speak out against the Taliban, initially on a blog published under a pseudonym on the BBC Urdu service website. There she chronicled the terror of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7834402.stm\" title=\"\">life in Swat when the area was being fought over by the Taliban and the government</a>. Later she spoke confidently in public against extremism and spoke of her desire to enter national politics.</p> <p>Some observers said Kayani was not just channelling the mood of anti-Taliban fury but also trying to build a national consensus around tackling militancy in Pakistan.</p> <p>In August he broke new ground in the debate over the country's vexed relationship with militant groups in a major speech in which he said the \"war against terrorism and extremism\" was the responsibility of the whole nation.</p> <p>Cyril Almeida, a newspaper columnist, said Kayani was attempting to \"channel public anger and sustain it\". He said: \"What the army understands is that anger and the sort of disgust currently felt towards the militants helps the state in their fight against militancy.\"</p> <p>The issue of how best to deal with the threat of militancy divides opinion in Pakistan, with some leading politicians, in particular Imran Khan, arguing for negotiations with a movement that they regard as a reaction to Pakistan's involvement in the \"US war in Afghanistan\".</p> <p>But in the wake of Yousafzai's shooting, and the images of the young girl unconscious in hospital, public sympathy for the Taliban appears to have plummeted.</p> <p>Khan, who led a rally of supporters towards the country's tribal areas on Sunday to protest against US drone strikes against militants, prompted a storm of criticism on Twitter and the country's chatshows for being too soft on the Taliban. He responded by announcing he would visit Yousafzai on Thursday and even offered to pay for her medical treatment.</p> <p>Raza Rumi, from the Jinnah Institute thinktank, suggested Khan would have to toughen his public stance against the Taliban. \"A couple of days ago he was talking of making peace with the Taliban and portraying them as a reaction to a few hundred killings by the drones,\" he said. \"Now his entire argument has fallen flat and he is making some rapid adjustments to his message.\"</p> <p>Public anger was also expressed in demonstrations held at the press clubs of most major Pakistani cities.</p> <p>Mohammad Malick, a television presenter and former newspaper editor, said the attempted killing of Yousafzai could prove to be a \"turning point\" that could embolden those who dare to speak out against the Taliban.</p> <p>\"The overwhelming majority is of the view that the Taliban have crossed the thin red line this time,\" he said. \"There is extreme shock and damnation, but the positive thing is that we see people are coming out talking about it. It is forcing people to take public positions.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron laid out on Wednesday the Conservative party's election battleground, paring it down to welfare, education and an attack on profligate Labour borrowing, while also addressing the elitism in his own personal story by saying his mission was to spread, rather than hoard, privilege .</p> <p>Closing his party conference with a counter-attacking speech, designed to repel Labour's ideological One Nation land grab, Cameron insisted a modern, compassionate Conservative party was leading the fight against poverty in Britain. It was not the party of the better off, but the \"want to be better off\", he said.</p> <p>He said it had fallen to him to lead the mission to create an \"aspiration nation\", in which dependency on welfare was ended and the toxic culture of low expectation in schools was thrown aside.</p> <p>He said Labour was a party of one notion \u2013 more borrowing \u2013 and simply did not grasp the scale of the global forces threatening the UK from China to Nigeria.</p> <p>The decision to focus on welfare reform and low aspiration in education, as well as attack Labour on spending, was a conscious move to focus on the areas where the coalition parties believe most has been achieved. Cameron claimed: \"These are not just battle lines for Britain's future, but also battlelines for the next election\".</p> <p>Implictly acknowledging he may have allowed Labour to fill some ideological space, he said he may have erred in failing to explain himself and his modernising mission enough. He said: \"The party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve. Conservatives think 'let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it'. It's not our style.</p> <p>\"But there is a problem with that. It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are \u2013 the cartoon Conservatives who don't care.</p> <p>\"The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we are the same old Tories that want to help the rich. It's because we are the Tories whose ideas help everyone \u2013 the poorest the most\".</p> <p>He said welfare reform was not working, arguing that the only route out of poverty was work, a message his pollsters insist resonates in Labour areas.</p> <p>He also tried to appropriate Labour's academies programme, claiming it was \"the old educational establishment \u2013 the leftwing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists\" who stood in the way of their expansion.</p> <p>In a bid to counter the claim that he stands for elitism in education, he said he was on the side of parents demanding the discipline and rigour displayed by the academies. He said: \"Isn't the great disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it is like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?</p> <p>\"Its the toxic culture of low expectations \u2013 the lack of ambition for every child \u2013 which has held this country back\".</p> <p>He tried to address criticism about his Etonian schooling: \"To all those people who say 'he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school', I say 'yes I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I'm not here to defend privilege. I'm here to spread it'.\"</p> <p>In a speech that said next to nothing on policing, immigration, civil liberties or the European Union, issues that had dominated many cabinet members' speeches, Cameron defended the NHS, his overseas aid programmes and commitment to a socially liberal society, the classic symbols of Cameron's modernising project.</p> <p>In the most difficult passage, he addressed the state of the economy in the wake of the latest IMF report which again downgraded UK growth.</p> <p>He said: \"I know you are asking whether the plan is working and here is the truth: the damage was worse than we thought and it's taking longer than we hoped.\"</p> <p>He blamed the slowing of the world economy, especially in the EU, over the past two years, but told delegates: \"Here is the crucial thing you need to know: yes, it's worse than we thought; yes, it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p> <p>He said \"it was a time of reckoning\", when the country would \"either sink or swim, do or decline\". Faced by global forces such as China, he said he was determined not to let his country slide, but instead to rise.</p> <p>In a typically optimistic passage, he argued: \"Aspiration is the engine of progress. Countries rise when they allow their people to rise . That is why the mission of this government is to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock all the promise in all our people.\"</p> <p>He gingerly suggested the economy was on the mend, citing the creation of 1m new jobs in the private sector, saying this was in net terms more than Labour managed in 10 years. In his only specific growth measure, he said Britain's planning laws would have to be scrapped so more housing could be built, vowing to scrap \"the suffocating bureaucracy\" that he said was holding economic growth back.</p> <p>He said: \"There are too many 'yes but no' people. The ones who say: 'Yes, our business needs to expand, but no, we cannot reform planning'.\"</p> <p>\"If we are going to be a winner in this global race, we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all.\"</p> <p>He attacked the so-called Nimbys. It had been \"OK for his generation that had got on the housing ladder\", he said, but the average age that people bought their first home today without any help from their parents was 33.\"We are the party of home ownership. We cannot let this carry on. We have to accept we need to build more houses in Britain,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are people who work hard year after year but are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom looking out of the window, dreaming of a place of their own.\"</p> <p>He launched a number of attacks on Labour, but was silent on his Liberal Democrat coalition partners. He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband by saying: \"While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you. They call us the party of the better off. No, we are the party of the want to be better off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families \u2013 and we should never be ashamed of saying so.\"</p> <p>He promised: \"Those with the broadest shoulders would bear the greatest burden. With us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this parliament than in any one of the 13 years under Labour.\"</p> <p>Previewing the attack he will mount at the next election, he said he did not think Labour had learned a single thing. \"When they were in office, their answer was always borrow more money. Now they are out of office, it's borrow more money. Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it is, borrow more money.\"</p>",
  "<p>The international community has failed to defend democracy in Maldives, said Mohamed Nasheed the ousted president of the Indian Ocean island state.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian a day after his release from detention, Nasheed, who was forced out in what supporters say was a coup earlier this year, said it was difficult for him to believe that \"democracy is sacred for the international community\".</p> <p>\"The people of the Maldives have lost faith with the international community \u2026 which has taken a very narrow view,\" said Nasheed, an internationally respected environmental activist who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/25/david-cameron-answers-questions\" title=\"\">described by David Cameron as his \"new best mate\"</a> in November 2011.</p> <p>Nasheed, who became the first democratically elected leader of the Maldives in 2008, resigned as president in February in a confused episode during which he says he was forced to relinquish power at gunpoint.</p> <p>International reaction has been relatively muted and Nasheed's overseas trips to Europe and elsewhere have failed to elicit the support his supporters had hoped for. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/maldives-mohamed-nasheed-arrested\" title=\"\">Arrested on Monday on Fares-Mathoda island</a>, in the Gaaf Dhaal atoll, about 440km away from the capital Mal\u00e9 after twice refusing summons to court to face charges linked to the controversial arrest of a senior judge while he was in power, Nasheed was held for 24 hours.</p> <p>Speaking after his release he said the charges were aimed at ensuring he cannot contest new presidential polls set to be held next year. A trial date has now been set in early November.</p> <p>\"It is very certain that they can't win [the election] with me [standing] as a candidate so they are trying all sorts of ways to stop me \u2026 It is really quite chilling,\" said the 45-year-old veteran political activist.</p> <p>Officials from the government of President Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who took power when Nasheed resigned in February, maintain their actions have been constitutional. An inquiry commission concluded that Nasheed left office legally. Abbas Riza, spokesman for the current president, has said everything had been done \"according to the country's law\".</p> <p>However, Amnesty International has described events in the Maldives as a \"human rights crisis\", reporting widespread police brutality and arbitrary arrests.</p> <p>Nasheed, 45, said his party, the Maldivian Democratic Party, would be forced to boycott polls to be held next year if, as appears likely, he is convicted and thus barred as a candidate. Such a boycott would seriously undermine the credibility of any election. The MDP has held frequent protests in recent months demanding polls. President Hassan has said he will hold elections in July 2013, the earliest time permitted by the constitution.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Chuck Close on Johannes Vermeer</strong></h2> <p>Ever since I was a student, my favourite artist has been Johannes Vermeer. I understand, or can intuit, how every painting ever made, from the Lascaux caves to today's most cutting-edge work, was painted. Information about a piece's creation \u2013 touch, hand, process, technique \u2013 is embedded in the paint, like a Hansel and Gretel trail.</p> <p>Vermeer, however, is the only artist whose paintings I cannot readily deconstruct. Other than the fact that they were all made with a camera-obscura-like contrivance, they remain impenetrable. The paint appears to have been blown on by divine breath. Neither opaque nor translucent, it does not seem to function as a film of pigment, but as light itself.</p> <p>While most people only notice the subject matter and marvel at the verisimilitude, time spent with a painting like The Milkmaid, painted in the 1650s, is time spent communing with an image so sublime that it transcends its physical reality (mere paint on a panel) and becomes an apparition worthy of creation by the gods. Such sophisticated and remarkable paint handling \u2013 all for a plain and ordinary-looking Dutchwoman with sleeves rolled up revealing a farmer's tan. The foodstuffs that surround her are so naturalistic, a passing fly might try to land on them, while the pail and the basket that hang on the wall are, in terms of perspective, perfect.</p> <p>On the floor rests a foot-warmer which, despite the abundant light flooding through the window, speaks to the unmistakable chill in the air. Chips of plaster are missing from the rough and cruddy surface of the wall, which is much in need of a paint job.</p> <p>So much information and compressed energy is packed into such a small painting. Inch for inch, The Milkmaid is one of the most remarkable achievements in art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397558781\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/10/1349882344028/Nashs-Event-on-the-Downs-001.jpg\" alt=\"Nash's Event on the Downs\" width=\"460\" height=\"383\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nash's Event on the Downs.

I tried to pin down what it was about them I found so compelling. After an hour or so, I was overcome by a wistful longing \u2013 a desire to return to the places in his pictures, as if I actually knew them myself.</p> <p>Place is about biography. It is more amorphous and less comprehensible than we suppose. Nash makes place not by verisimilitude, but by summoning up totemic symbols, motifs and spirit. His is an unconscious depiction borne out of a creative process. At its heart is an exploration of both English surrealism and the English landscape: looking and finding ancient animism in the rocks, trees and hills of an old land.</p> <p>This is where I go to in his paintings: a half-remembered or half-imagined place that I can share with him \u2013 a warm cornfield on the edge of a disused country estate, a chalk scar disfiguring a hill, the humus, fungi and dead leaves on the floor of a damp copse.</p> <p>I will always love his <a href=\"http://www.gac.culture.gov.uk/work.aspx?obj=18666\" title=\"\">Event on the Downs (1934)</a>. A tree stump sits by a tennis ball in the foreground, a forked track divides the middle ground, and the chalk downs fill the background. A cloud-as-flint or a flint-as-cloud hovers nowhere in an impasto sky. The relationships between the inhabitants or personages in Nash's paintings, whether organic or inorganic, are always unsettling, out of scale, odd. He often leaves canvas bare, appearing not to be an artist who loves the stuff of paint. Instead, he fills in anxiously. The ungainliness of his pictures, although slight, is part of their attraction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397558782\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/10/1349882569983/Piero-della-Francescas-Th-001.jpg\" alt=\"Piero della Francesca's The Baptism of Christ\" width=\"460\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piero della Francesca's The Baptism of Christ.

I first saw it at the National Gallery in London when I was nine or 10. I remember seeing it again as a teenager, and later during my first year at Brighton College. Then a boyfriend took me to see his favourite painting: it happened to be this one.</p> <p>I see a quiet symmetry in it, which is one of the things that makes it feel like a silent painting. By symmetry, I mean the way Piero has constructed four \"pillars\" across the canvas. There are the angels on the left, the tree, the figure of Jesus, and then the partially clothed figure in the background. Together they give sculptural and vertical strength \u2013 almost like a building. To emphasise this verticality, the blue cords on the robes of the garments, about a third of the way up the painting, hold the image together horizontally. This is what draws me in.</p> <p>The architectural quality appeals to me. When I was making Ghost \u2013 a cast of an entire room, stripped down to its&#xa0;bare architecture \u2013 I had a postcard of this on the wall of the room I was&#xa0;casting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397558783\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/10/1349882426314/Man-Rays-Dust-Breeding-001.jpg\" alt=\"Man Ray's Dust Breeding\" width=\"460\" height=\"363\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man Ray's Dust Breeding.

It looked like an aerial photograph, or a view through a microscope. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/apr/28/photography-sophie-ristelhueber-best-shot\" title=\"\">Taken in 1920, it seemed a truly ambiguous image \u2013 abstract, yet at the same time an accurate record.</a> It was only later, when&#xa0;I'd read more, that I appreciated how Duchamp deified neglect: he thought allowing dust to settle could be a valid process in the making of art.</p> <p>The Large Glass, which took Duchamp about eight years to complete, was a work-in-progress when Man Ray took this. As the dust gathered, it was silently recording the time Duchamp took to process his ideas. Duchamp allowed this long pause to become part of the final work \u2013 fixing some of the dust to the surface with varnish so that it looked like stained glass.</p> <p>In 1997, I made a pair of earplugs from dust collected in the Whispering Gallery of St Paul's Cathedral; and in 2001, I made a homage to this photograph, called Dust Breeding (On Judd). The Chinati Foundation, a contemporary art museum in Texas founded by the sculptor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2004/jan/17/art2\" title=\"\">Donald Judd</a>, asked me to create a print. I asked them to clean Judd's 100 stainless steel sculptures, housed in an aircraft hangar there, and send me the dust. When magnified, it was teeming, made up of particles of sand and cacti that had blown in from the desert, wasps, and the legs of other insects. Dust, in the end, settles on everything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397558784\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/10/1349882481376/Millaiss-Ophelia-001.jpg\" alt=\"Millais's Ophelia\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Millais's Ophelia Photograph: Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ed Ruscha on John Everett Millais</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>I first saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2007/sep/25/millaisthegreatestcinematographerofthenineteenthcentury\" title=\"\">John Everett Millais's Ophelia</a> when I came to the UK in 1961 and was struck by its originality.

The feeling passed, but the nature of this painting stayed with me.</p> <p>At first, I didn't delve into its story and symbolism. I viewed it strictly as a picture, how it was composed and so on. But later I learned that it had been analysed by so many people. Every blade of grass and each plant has been botanically identified, and someone has found almost exactly where Millais set up his easel. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Everett_Millais,_Ophelia_(1851%E2%80%931852,_skull_detail).jpg\" title=\"\">Some believe there is a skull hidden just to the left of the forget-me-nots on the right.</a></p> <p>The painting became a trigger in my art, an inspiration.

My study of art is ordered on that thinking: that you look at something almost as if it were a tabletop arrangement.

  "<p>China, as some pundits like to insist, is different. The same might be said of France, Burundi, Japan or any country with a strong sense of identity. In the case of China, though, we are invited to accept that China can benefit from engagement in the world \u2013 from the globalisation that brought billions of investment into the country, the international trade that fed its long boom, or the raising of billions in capital for Chinese companies on international stock exchanges \u2013 without accepting the rules.</p> <p>The past two years have been unkind to many Chinese companies that were seeking global markets or international capital, what with fraud scandals and suspicions that Chinese companies operate as an arm of the state. The latest report from the US House of Representatives' intelligence committee \u2013 which claims after an 11-month investigation that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is closer than it admits to the Chinese military</a> \u2013 falls into the second category and will greatly hamper Huawei's ambitions in the US market. But both the international fraud scandals and the suspicions around Huawei are rooted in the secrecy and corruption that flourishes back home.</p> <p>Huawei strenuously denies the charges and accuses US legislators and regulators of McCarthy-style witch-hunting. The timing has not helped the company: many candidates for US-elected office find China a convenient whipping boy for US-made ills. The congressional elections two years ago, like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">presidential elections</a> now, produced some startling anti-China ads that seemed to date from the days when yellow peril was an acceptable term in politics. But the verdict on Huawei \u2013 and the dubious reputation that stalks other Chinese companies with global ambitions \u2013 cannot simply be dismissed as witch-hunting or protectionism.</p> <p>The China difference that generates daily frictions internationally has nothing to do with China's claim to historic exceptionalism \u2013 used, with other recently invented theories, to justify the Communist party's monopoly on power. It is rather the fact that the party bends every rule in China to its own advantage and companies that do not conform to these priorities risk being destroyed. China can legitimately argue that its internal arrangements are its own business, but when Chinese companies are on US or European soil, it becomes our business too.</p> <p>It is not entirely the fault of the companies: even the most ethical and transparent Chinese enterprise can find itself struggling to understand, let alone to adhere to, foreign standards of auditing, transparency, governance and accountability, when it has prospered at home in a system in which secrecy, cronyism, false accounting and connections to power are the default political and business environment, not the exception.</p> <p>The China difference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/13/china-economic-success-example-world\" title=\"\">served China well</a> as its economy rose on the back of globalisation, the labours of an underpaid workforce, state subsidies and lax enforcement of the rulebook. But now that Chinese companies operate in a global environment and raise capital on international stock exchanges, the China difference is proving intractable for some.</p> <p>When Chinese companies first sought listings on the New York stock exchange, they were greeted with enthusiasm by investors who wanted to buy into the myth of the China miracle. Investors lost millions in hundreds of Chinese companies that listed by the back door, through the perfectly legal practice of buying traded <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation\" title=\"\">US shell companies</a>, thus avoiding the initial scrutiny that accompanies an IPO. Others companies listed in the conventional way, but were subsequently hit by fraud scandals, bringing equally painful losses.</p> <p>Now there is a long and unhappy stand-off between US regulators, in particular the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and the Chinese authorities over China's refusal to allow US regulators to verify the auditing of US-listed companies. Since 2009, China has ordered that the necessary paperwork be withheld, arguing that US regulators should not have authority in China. The dispute is emblematic of the wider clash between China's domestic political system and the rules that prevail elsewhere. As long as China's corruption is endemic and the party continues to insist that rule of law, transparency and good governance come a poor second to Communist party interests, China's ambitious companies will be caught between a domestic regime that demands that rules be bent and an international one that insists they must not be.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022\u2009Has the private sector really created one million jobs under the coalition, as Cameron and his team routinely claim? Not quite. Some 874,000 such jobs have indeed been created, but eagle-eyed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2012/oct/10/conservative-conference-2012-davidcameron\" title=\"Reality check\">Guardian fact checkers</a> have spotted that 196,000 pre-existing jobs were reclassified as private (not public) sector jobs this year. So that's OK, Dave.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Poor <strong>Paul Dacre</strong>. So alarmed is the foul-mouthed puritan editor of the Daily Mail that Boris may one day lead the Tory party, that he has to defend Cameron. On Wednesday he loaded one of Fleet Street's big bazookas, <strong>Max Hastings</strong>, to denounce his former columnist as \"bereft of judgment, loyalty and discretion\". If that wasn't enough to earn his fee (\u00a32,000?) Sir Max suggested that Boris is no more trustworthy on money than on women and accused him of trying to blackmail a media boss who had exposed Boris's tangled love life \u2013 by threatening to expose his own.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009On Wednesday's airwaves, <strong>William Hague </strong>conceded that the Tories are becoming more socially liberal as society does and that he is part of the trend. A far cry from his son-of-Thatcher teens and \"foreign land\" leadership phase. But welcome all the same. And whose joke is that? Blogger Mark Wallace claims it's Cameron's own. But only in private.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Wannabe Tory MPs were warned in Brum that they are expected to turn up at Corby's byelection to help save <strong>Louise Mensch</strong>'s old seat from Labour. If they don't they may be struck off the approved candidates list, it is hinted. Sheer bluff? Wannabes cough up \u00a390 a year to stay on the list. <strong>Lord Ashcroft </strong>can't pay for everything.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Bookie Paddy Power confirms that the PM did order the 9/2 favourite (rogan josh) on his birthday curry foray in Brum with Sam Cam. But he also ordered a bhuna as well. Anything to boost demand in the Midlands economy.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Good day: <strong>Lord Seb Coe </strong>who did his Olympic riff (again) with grace and modesty and was rewarded with the standing ovation he never got as a Tory MP.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Bad day: <strong>George Osborne </strong>\u2013 media serialisation of Janan Ganesh's flattering biography of the chancellor raked over his \"Yachtgate\" brush with Peter Mandelson on an oligarch's gin palace off Corfu.

Apparently, Trust were \"born out of desperation in the brutal Canadian winter of 2009\" when the pair \"began writing songs about nostalgia, lust, and erotomania\". We're not sure whether Postepski left owing to issues arising from the lust and erotomania part or because she felt nostalgic herself and missed doing her thing as Austra. Either way, Trust is just Alfons now \u2013 he's the one in charge of the synth arpeggios, programmed throbs, and a voice that vacillates between a low post-Iggy tone with tinges of goth and something a little more wheedling and whiny, like Kenneth Williams moaning or <a href=\"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/41764_1675520100_1783_n.jpg\" title=\"\">Albert Steptoe leering</a>.

Click here to listen</a></p> <p>What Trust have done, principally, is put out an album called TRST that's very much in hock not only to synthpop but also (if you want to believe it's not entirely mired in early-80s electronica) to slow techno. Some have referenced Crystal Castles in reviews, others Fever Ray and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/01/popandrock.electronicmusic\" title=\"\">Delphic</a>. But really, the tracks on TRST sound mostly like lost classics from a nightclub playlist that might have featured 12-inch singles such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnTiNH5Oii8\" title=\"\">Memorabilia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSn2K3eciSc\" title=\"\">Hard Times</a>, I Just Can't Get Enough, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVQnFzZUITM\" title=\"\">Situation</a>, Visage, Everything's Gone Green, Der Mussolini and Chant No 1.</p> <p>This was a decade of dance, of decadence, when Euro hauteur became infused with earthly pop concerns and electronic music used the cold, Teutonic milieu to express the sort of feelings normally the preserve of rock or singer-songwriter acoustica: love and sex, deceit and longing, with an accent on sin, retribution and the dark side of desire. Alfons describes his music as \"emotional dance\" and admits to being a fan of \"heartbreaking music like Nick Drake and Brian Eno, people who have written the most unbelievably gorgeous music I've ever heard\". His lyrics are, he says, \"more about sexual repression and gazing and being not so much 'in it'. I don't think they're intentionally sexual, or overtly sexual.\" He's obviously forgetting that titles on TRST include Gloryhole, Candy Walls and This Ready Flesh.</p> <p>We've only been streaming it and don't have a finished copy, but we're hoping Trust's debut album opens with <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/artsandcraftsmx/trust-sulk\" title=\"\">Sulk</a>. That's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/apr/27/popandrock.alexispetridis\" title=\"\">a very 1982 synthpop song title</a> right there, with the requisite sense of emotional abandon amid the early-Mode pulsebeats. It is scented with eau d'goth. <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/sacredbones/trust-candy-walls\" title=\"\">Candy Walls</a>, too, is heavy on atmospherics and metaphorical dry ice, positing Alfons, the lugubrious and lonely Canuck, as a digital <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/leonard-cohen\" title=\"\">Leonard Cohen</a>. There's a track called Shoom, which you imagine could be about the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shoom-Club-25th-Anniversary-Event-2012/172601649514164\" title=\"\">emblematic haunt of late-80s smiley culture</a>, but there are no slippery aciiid basslines here, just the pounding, insistent 4/4 rhythm of an earlier era. Some of these songs are so catchy, you can't believe no one thought of them before. And even the ones where Postepski's still onboard and sounding sexily bored will make you tap a toe, obviously encased in thigh-high, shiny, shiny boots of leather.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"An album you should listen to.

  "<p>MPs are to launch an inquiry into the government's decision to pump \u00a3375bn of new money into the economy, amid growing concerns that the policy has not worked and could cause rapid inflation in future.</p> <p>Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the cross-party Treasury select committee, said they were taking action because \"some people may be worse off as a result\" of the policy, known as quantitative easing, or QE, and that it required \"careful scrutiny\".</p> <p>He added that the committee would look at the \"winners and losers\" from QE and its cost to the taxpayer.</p> <p>There is growing concern that the four tranches of QE between 2009 and this summer have not worked, that they could have caused more damage to the economy than good, and that it should not be repeated. Economists expect another \u00a350bn of QE to be announced next month.</p> <p>Business secretary Vince Cable has admitted ministers are unsure QE is working. \"Does it work, or \u2026 does it have so many negative consequences we shouldn't do it any more?\" said Cable last month.</p> <p>Pressure for the inquiry was led by Andrea Leadsom, another Tory member of the select committee and a former bank trader, who quoted the head of Standard Chartered bank saying the risks to financial stability from QE were \"unknown\".</p> <p>Leadsom said she was concerned that, because it was dominated by economists, the Bank of England had not got the best deal from spending the virtual new money, mostly on gilts, by allowing traders to raise prices ahead of its huge spending sprees, and putting some of the money into the hands of foreign banks \u2013 an issue the committee will specifically look at. Asking the bank to judge the effectiveness of the policy was \"like asking Google to investigate their activities on the internet\", said Leadsom.</p> <p>Other concerns include the impact of low interest rates on savers and pensioners; that there is no evidence banks have used the money to lend to businesses; and that, compared to the early 1990s recession, unemployment and business start-ups and failures do not seem to be noticeably better as a result of QE, said Leadsom. The cost of \"unwinding\" the policy by reselling the gilts purchased was also prompting concern about who would bear the loss and future inflation.</p> <p>\"From my position it's very hard to say QE has benefitted economic growth,\" she told a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference in Birmingham.</p> <p>Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers, whose members manage a quarter of UK investments, said the first \u00a3200bn round of QE in 2009 had had \"a positive effect\" but said there were question marks over the subsequent tranches last year and this year.</p> <p>He was also concerned the policy was creating a fear that early signs of economic growth were only thanks to QE.</p> <p>\"I'm certainly unsure further QE is going to help confidence, and in fact if you could stop it and see recovery begin to emerge perhaps that would have a positive effect,\" Thoresen told the same event, organised by the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank.</p> <p>Other critics have seized on a Bank of England report in September showing that the benefits of the policy were \"heavily skewed\" towards people and households that owned the most assets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2012/nr073.pdf\" title=\"\">The report also mounted a robust defence of QE</a>, addressing emerging criticisms.</p> <p>\"Without the Bank's asset purchases, most people in the UK would have been worse off,\" it said. \"Economic growth would have been lower. Unemployment would have been higher. Many more companies would have gone out of business. This would have had a significant detrimental impact on savers and pensioners along with every other group in our society. All assessments of the effect of asset purchases must be seen in that light.\"</p> <p>Supporters of QE also suggest lower interest rates have helped stop house prices from collapsing. And they reject claims that unwinding QE could create inflation, arguing inflation is a sign of growth, and if it does occur the Bank of England has other tools, namely raising interest rates, to attempt to control it.</p> <p>In June, the bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, used his annual Mansion House speech to say that critics were \"too pessimistic\".</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"The Bank of England has published detailed analysis of the impact of QE, which concluded that it has had a significant positive impact; without QE most people in the UK would have been worse off, economic growth would be lower, and unemployment would be higher.\"</p>",
  "<p>As markets drifted lower once more, <strong>Smith and Nephew</strong> was among the biggest fallers.</p> <p>The medical equipment group, which specialises in artificial hips and knees, stumbled after its shares went ex-dividend and analysts at Societe Generale issued a sell note. They said:</p> <blockquote> Given that we see downside risk to the consensus earnings per share forecasts, that we find the valuation unappealing, and that Smith &amp; Nephew has not executed well on M&amp;A in the past, we are initiating coverage with a sell rating. We are aware that a few upside risks exist, but if they do materialise, they are unlikely to alter our bearish view until 2014. <br> </blockquote> <p>It said the company's research and development programme would take longer than expected to mitigate pressure on prices, while the benefits of its restructuring plans would not entirely offset the cost of its investment programme. It added:</p> <blockquote> If [a] planned US medical device tax does materialise, there will be a further 4% downside to our 2013-2017 earnings per share estimates. <br> Finally, we note that Smith &amp; Nephew is considering an accretive acquisition or buyback. However, given recent management changes, we would not be surprised if this decision gets delayed until 2014. </blockquote> <p>Smith and Nephew lost 17.5p to 655p, a 2.6% decline. Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 33.54 points lower at 5776.71 as the continuing lack of resolution to the eurozone crisis and the IMF's gloomy forecasts for the global economy weighed on sentiment. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Equity markets have done nothing but grind gradually lower in the past few days as the economic outlook both domestically and outside of the UK has deteriorated. Investors are struggling to find any rational reasons to considerably increase their exposure to equities when there are people left right and centre warning them of stormy waters ahead. <br> Whilst the bulls seem incapable of lifting us higher, the bears are also unable to take control and push us significantly lower. Every time there's a bit of bad economic data we should be seeing markets take a dive, but the prospect of more stimulus from central banks around the world seems to be creating rather a false environment. </blockquote> <p>Banks were boosted by renewed reports of a decision by the Financial Services Authority to relax capital and liquidity rules to stimulate lending. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> added 1.475p to 38.48p while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 5.4p to 262.7p ahead of its Direct Line flotation.</p> <p>Meanwhile the mining sector lost earlier gains which followed better than expected third quarter figures from US group Alcoa. However the aluminium producer tempered the good news by echoing recent concerns about a slowdown in China, a key market for commodity companies. So <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> slipped 29p to \u00a330.01, <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 15p to 1920.5p and <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> fell 30p to \u00a310.60.</p> <p>Safer sectors such as water companies were in demand amidst the uncertainty. <strong>United Utilities</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/sep/18/united-utilities-bid-talk-ftse-falls?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">recently the subject of bid speculation</a>, moved higher in the last half hour of trading, ending 11.5p higher at 729p.</p> <p>Chip designers led the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 fallers after downbeat coverage from Credit Suisse. <strong>Arm</strong> lost 17p to 578.5p after the bank issued a neutral rating with a 538p price target. It said:</p> <blockquote> Arm is a strong fundamental bottom-up earnings growth story; however, we estimate that its key growth drivers - smartphones, tablets and notebooks - are already factored into consensus estimates and the valuation. Thus we see limited scope for upside in the near term, especially as we do not see any near-term catalysts for earnings upgrades. <br> </blockquote> <p>Credit Suisse also began coverage of <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong>, down 47p to 455.5p with an underperform recommendation and 347p price target</p> <p>With revived talk of a possible bid from US shareholder Blackrock and others, hedge fund group <strong>Man</strong> added 3.45p to 93.4p.</p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Avanti Communications</strong> came down to earth, losing 65p to 283.75p or nearly 19% after the satellite operator's full year results fell short of expectations. Its revenues more than doubled but losses increased from \u00a312.7m to \u00a316m and it adopted \"more conservative accounting treatments\" given a move to the full list. Analyst Robert Corden at Charles Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> The group reported revenues of \u00a312.6m for the year to June 2012 against previous guidance of \u00a317.8m. This shortfall was due to a change of accounting policies on the treatment of certain revenues which will now be recognised over the length of contracts regardless of upfront payment. This change came as a complete surprise to the market and led us to the comment of poor communication. <br> Our preliminary thoughts are that there remains significant upside potential in the share price, but the timing has been very substantially delayed. </blockquote> <p>Finally drug discovery group <strong>Summit Corporation</strong> closed 27% higher at 4.75p after positive results from a clinical trial of its treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a fatal wasting disease. Analysts at N+1 Singer said: </p> <blockquote> Today's news is critical for Summit, as it gives the company a 'green light' for its lead candidate, which investors <br>can now comfortably assume represents a realistic out-licensing proposition. Furthermore the news underlines <br>Summit as a potentially sustainable investment vehicle with a realistic probability of value accretion. </blockquote>",
  "<p>In the battle for northern Syria the most important front is far from Aleppo. It is across the border in the southern Turkish town of Antakya. Here rebels, who now move around with increasing ease, are engaged in daily bids for patronage with those who keep the insurgency running.</p> <p>Over the past year, and especially since May, when weapons started to arrive, Bashar al-Assad's enemies have met their benefactors in Antakya's backstreets, coffee shops and hotel lobbies and made a case as to why they should receive help.</p> <p>The rivalries of Arab and Gulf politics, divisions between the west and Russia, fear of Syria's bloody crisis spreading beyond the country's borders to drag in Iran or Lebanon all make supplying arms to the rebels a sensitive and murky issue.</p> <p>Now, it seems, the supply is drying up. On Aleppo's frontlines, there is still no sign of the heavy weapons for which the rebels have pleaded. Ammunition is running low. \"They are giving us enough to keep this fight going, but not enough to win it,\" complained Abu Furat, a commander. \"I'm sure that's not going to change until after the American elections. I'm not sure everyone can survive until then.\"</p> <p>The men with the money and influence in Antakya are envoys sent by the Sunni world's political elite or business leaders. One name comes up more than any other \u2013 a Lebanese MP named Okab Sakr.</p> <p>\"Every time Okab is in town the weapons start to move across the border,\" said a rebel colonel from the Jebel al-Zawiya region, who calls himself Abu Wael. \"The problem is he is very particular about where those weapons go.\"</p> <p>Sakr is a member of the Future movement of the Lebanese opposition leader, Saad Hariri. According to colleagues in Beirut he has been given the role of gun runner-in-chief. Sakr has become a polarising figure among Syria's fragmented opposition; those he supplies see him as a saviour; those who miss out hold him responsible for the faltering rebel cause.</p> <p>Dissatisfaction with Sakr's role goes further. The US, always jittery about backing the uprising, is opposed to calls by Saudi Arabia and Qatar to supply rebel groups with equipment needed to combat aircraft and tanks \u2013 an issue raised by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Monday. Jordan and Turkey appear to share Washington's concerns. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/us-troops-jordan-syria-crisis\" title=\"\">Confirmation</a> on Wednesday that the US had sent a military mission to Jordan to help build a headquarters on the border with Syria and to improve Jordan's military capabilities underlines worries about possible spillover.</p> <p>\"It's about indirect intervention,\" said Mustafa Alani of the Saudi-financed Gulf Research Centre in Abu Dhabi. \"The money is there, arms can be supplied. But the Jordanians and the Turks are hesitant. Turkey is allowing some weapons in but there are a lot of restrictions. People are waiting for a shift after the US election.\"</p> <p>Another growing problem is a lack of co-ordination between Qatar and the Saudis \u2013 the likely subject of Wednesday's talks in Doha between the Emir and the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar. King Abdullah is said to be growing impatient with the difficulties of the Syrian crisis. According to Syrian opposition activists, the Saudis now sponsor only rebel groups which are at odds with those backed by Qatar and Turkey, which are often linked to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>\"The Qataris are much more proactive than the Saudis,\" said one well-placed Arab source. \"The Saudis are not interested in democracy, they just want to be rid of Bashar. They would be happy with a Yemeni solution that gets rid of the president and leaves the regime intact.\"</p> <p>Intelligence chiefs from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and France reportedly met in Turkey in early September along with the CIA director general, David Petraeus. But they apparently failed to reach agreement on a co-ordinated strategy.</p> <p>US officials say the opaque nature of the opposition and the creeping presence of foreign jihadis are behind their pressure on Riyadh and Doha. \"They have both been given a yellow light by the Americans,\" said a Lebanese minister aligned to the Future movement. \"The Saudis see yellow as yellow, but the Qataris have seen it as green. Their connections with and supply to the opposition have continued, perhaps escalated. The Americans are especially against handing out anti-aircraft missiles. They will not accept these things falling into the hands of jihadis. Imagine having to do a Stinger buy-back programme like Afghanistan all over again.\"</p> <p>Now the Saudis are signalling that they are reaching the limits of what they will do in the face of US objections, concern about the resilience of the Assad regime, fears that extremists will dominate the opposition \u2013 as well as the risks of \"blowback\" from jihadis returning home.</p> <p>The initial armed support for the rebels resulted in two substantial shipments of automatic weapons, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenades, delivered in May and June from Turkey. Since then, large-scale gun-running has dried up.</p> <p>\"The Saudis were the most enthusiastic by far about getting weapons to the rebels,\" said a former Lebanese MP. \"They were public about it and committed. That was until July.\" By the middle of that month, foreign jihadis started trickling into Syria looking to join the fray.</p> <p>The rebel military council, a group of defected senior officers, is opposed to the foreigners and wary of Syria's own Islamist groups, who have been organising and arming in the rural areas between Aleppo and Idlib.</p> <p>Riyadh worries too about its home front, where the Syrian issue is kept alive by the likes of Sheikh Adnan Arour, a rabidly sectarian Salafi televangelist. Official media continue to bombard the public with images of atrocities carried out by Alawites \u2013 Assad's ruling sect. But non-establishment clerics who wanted to launch a fundraising drive to aid Syria were ordered to hold off. An official campaign raised more than $100m in a few days.</p> <p>\"The Saudis fear that there will be blowback from Syria like there was from Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Alani. \"They don't want chaos. They want the Syrian military to take over. The whole region wants that, including the Israelis. Everyone wants an organised structure of army officers who will keep weapons under control and make sure that they are handed in.\"</p> <p>Now the Saudis are pushing the armed Syrian opposition to form a \"salvation front\" with unified command and control on the ground and, crucially, an ability to collect weapons once fighting has ended \u2013 a lesson learned the hard way from Libya. The Saudis are backing brigadier-general Manaf Tlass, the most senior defector yet from the military \u2013 from a key Sunni family \u2013 as part of a drive to win over other figures from the Syrian army and security establishment. \"It's no good calling for them to be held accountable for crimes,\" warned Alani. \"They need to be told they will get support.\" Next week the Qataris are hosting a conference to try to unite a host of squabbling opposition groups.</p> <p>But there is little optimism about prospects for any immediate improvement. \"It's all a bit of a mess,\" said analyst Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution in Doha. \"Everyone is waiting for someone else to do a better job. It can't be the Saudis or the Qataris or the Turks. It's got to be the Americans. If we are looking at Gulf support it's certainly been a big story, but that's not the reality. There's a big gap between what people think the Gulf countries have been doing and what they are actually doing. Not that many weapons have been delivered.\"</p>",

The two other band members, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, remain behind bars.</p> <p>Moscow newsrooms erupted when the news came in and Twitter was flooded with both joy and reservation.</p> <p>What just happened? Was this a small triumph for Russia's beleaguered justice system? Or a cynical appeal to confuse and divide both the punk group and, by extension, Russia's protest movement?</p> <p>If you pay close attention to the justice system in Russia, you'll notice that it can get pretty personal. This isn't something unique to Russia, but it's an element of the justice process that gets a lot of play in the press - especially if it's prominent oppositionists on trial.</p> <p>Based on the antagonism between the original Pussy Riot judge, Marina Syrova, and the lawyers for the punk group, one gets the sense that Samutsevich was probably smart to switch her old lawyer, Violetta Volkova, for Irina Khrunova.</p> <p>I don't believe this comes down to a discussion about which lawyer is better at her job \u2013 much like Volkova, Khrunova is a prominent member of the legal establishment. Rather, the issue is that the judges in Moscow were unimpressed with the way the defence conducted the case.</p> <p>The original trial of the punk band, who were sentenced to two years in a penal colony for performing a \"punk prayer\" against Vladimir Putin in Russia's main cathedral, was heavily politicised on both sides of the pro-Kremlin and anti-Kremlin divide. Prominent opposition figures, including anti-corruption crusader Alexei Navalny, were invited to testify in favour of the three women on trial \u2013 and were ultimately barred from doing so.</p> <p>It was a circus of grandiose proportions and with sinister overtones for the defendants and their families. When the appeal hearing came round, Samutsevich probably reasoned that it was time to switch tactics. For her, this made perfect sense.</p> <p>During the original trial, much emphasis was placed on the blasphemy of the women doing their dance right in front of the altar. While their stunt was obviously offensive for many Orthodox Christians (myself included), the emphasis placed on religion during the court proceedings made one wonder if we were back in the dark ages all of a sudden. And the text of Judge Syrova's verdict once again emphasised the dancing, the moves and the scandalous attire of the punk rockers.</p> <p>But Samutsevich never got to dance in front of the altar, you see. According to the security camera footage, and to all of the testimony that was given in court, she never made it that far. Security guards escorted her away before she could join the other women in their performance.</p> <p>Following the performance, Samutsevich willingly gave testimony to the police. She never tried to hide from justice. And her arrest in the early spring of this year was quite a shock at the time.</p> <p>Lawyer Khrunova pounced on all of this. The text of her appeal is dry and straightforward. Samutsevich's actions should have been judged on her own merit \u2013 as per Russian law.</p> <p>But the appeal, in arguing against the idea that Samutsevich was motivated by religious hatred, also does not shy away from the fact that the performance was political. Samutsevich has not backed away from her views. She believes that it's her commitment to opposition politics that has led to her persecution.</p> <p>When Samutsevich first switched lawyers it was pointed out that she probably got tired of spending time behind bars \"for the sake of publicity\". I think that Samutsevich correctly understood that she had a way out \u2013 and that judges in Moscow were seriously prejudiced against her original lawyer. In that sense, Samutsevich played her cards right.</p> <p>She bid her fellow band members an emotional goodbye in court, and her lawyers expressed happiness at the decision \u2013 as well as bewilderment at the fact that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, both of whom have small children at home, remain behind bars.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/putin-backs-pussy-riot-conviction\" title=\"\">Just a few days ago</a>, Vladimir Putin expressed satisfaction at the Pussy Riot sentencing and thus the sudden leniency shown toward Samutsevich could have been a means of re-establishing some sense of independence for the courts were it not for the fact the decision was so clear cut. And while it's disturbing that clemency shocks us, nowadays, what's more disturbing is that two of these women will not be rejoining their families any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Parts of the evidence against the terrorist suspect Abu Qatada are \"a bit thin\", according to the judge considering his deportation to face trial in Jordan.</p> <p>Mr Justice Mitting also questioned how the 51-year-old radical cleric could be fairly convicted if all the alleged co-conspirators in a Jordanian bomb plot had since been acquitted \u2013 which they have.</p> <p>The judge's comments were made at the opening of an eight-day appeal against extradition by Abu Qatada, also known as Omar Othman, in the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) in central London.</p> <p>The government is determined to send him to Jordan, where he was convicted in his absence of involvement in two terrorist conspiracies dating back to 1999 and 2000. He would face a retrial .</p> <p>The extradition case against Abu Qatada has been running since 2002 when he was first arrested in Britain. Since then he has either been in prison or under severely restrictive bail conditions which, at one stage, included a 22-hour curfew. At an earlier hearing it was described as \"the longest period of administrative detention as far as we know in modern English history\".</p> <p>As the hearing began, Mitting, the president of Siac, observed: \"The evidence [in one of the plots] seems a bit thin.\" He also referred to the difficulty of using evidence from alleged co-conspirators who had subsequently had their convictions quashed. In January, the European court of human rights in Strasbourg ruled that evidence of his involvement was obtained by torturing one of his co-defendants and there was a high probability it would be used at a retrial, where it would be \"of considerable, perhaps decisive importance\".</p> <p>The quality of the evidence will not, however, be a determining factor in Siac's decision about whether the Jordanian-born cleric should be removed from the United Kingdom. The Home Office is trying to persuade the commission that Abu Qatada will receive a fair trial if returned to Jordan following reassurances that no evidence obtained through torture will be used against him.</p> <p>Following several ministerial visits to the Jordanian capital, Amman, this summer, the Home Office believes it has now been provided with sufficiently robust reassurances that no evidence obtained through torture will be used against Abu Qatada and that he will receive a fair trial.</p> <p>Abu Qatada's appeal is chiefly on the grounds that the evidence extracted under torture would nonetheless be used against him in Jordan's state security court and that it was not an impartial system of justice.</p> <p>Danny Friedman, representing Abu Qatada, told the hearing: \"There are some serious issues with the allegations made against Mr Othman.\"</p> <p>Friedman denied that the aim of the appeal was simply delay. \"We are not saying two more appeals and 10 more years [of legal postponements],\" he added.</p> <p>Outline arguments presented to the hearing by Robin Tam QC, for the Home Office, state that Abu Qatada's deportation to Jordan \"forthwith\" would \"be compatible with the government's obligations under the [human rights] convention\".</p> <p>Statements previously obtained from his co-conspirators, supposedly under torture, will not be relied on in the retrial, Tam said. \"Given that [the pardoned co-conspirators] al-Hamasher and Abu Hawsher are no longer defendants before the court, [Abu Qatada] must be given the right to examine them.</p> <p>\"Accordingly, if the [Jordanian] prosecutor wishes to rely on the evidence of these former co-defendants, he must call [them] as witnesses to testify under oath in the retrial.\" In court, he said, they would not be under duress.</p> <p>Tam also raised doubts about whether one of the witnesses had actually been tortured. \"No actual allegations of torture in respect of Abu Hawsher were advanced by [his lawyer],\" he said.</p> <p>The fact that three civilian judges will sit on the court panel, without any military officers, removes the \"objectionable features\" of a military court previously identified by Siac, Tam argued.</p> <p>Suggestions that Abu Qatada might, if acquitted, be taken \"into administrative detention under the 1954 Law on Crime Prevention\" were dismissed as \"scraping the barrel\" to find excuses to avoid deportation.</p> <p>Sections of the Siac hearings will be held in secret \u2013 known as \"closed material procedures\" \u2013 where only special advocates, who have been given security clearance, and the judges can see sensitive, intelligence evidence.</p> <p>Some of the sessions are therefore referred to as being in \"open\" and other parts in \"closed\" session. At one stage lawyers referred to \"open closing submissions\" and \"closed closing submissions\" to distinguish between different sections of the hearing. The media and most of the lawyers were sent out of court for a brief period while the special advocates discussed secret evidence.</p> <p>The Home Office says videos of Abu Qatada's sermons influenced Muhammad Atta, the ringleader of the September 11 attacks on the United States. Abu Qatada has been described by a judge as Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe.</p> <p>Anthony Layden, the former British ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances, will give evidence on Thursday. He will be followed by a Jordanian lawyer, Thaer Najdawi, who advises the British embassy in Amman.</p>",
  "<p>So pervasive and reliable is the rule of elite immunity - even in the face of the most egregious crimes - that one finds extreme examples on a weekly basis. Six weeks ago, the Obama justice department <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer\">forever precluded the possibility</a> of criminal accountability for Bush torturers by refusing to bring charges in the only two remaining torture cases, ones involving the deaths of the detainee-victims by torture. </p> <p>The Obama campaign is now running a new campaign ad against Mitt Romney that rails against a litany of Wall Street \"criminals\" and \"gluttons of greed\", but as David Dayen <a href=\"http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/10/09/obama-ad-about-big-bird-cannot-find-one-prominent-wall-street-criminal-prosecuted-by-administration/\">astutely notes</a>, those examples were all imprisoned during the Bush era because the Obama administration has prosecuted no significant Wall Street executives for the 2008 financial collapse and thus have none of their own examples to highlight:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"So the Obama campaign could not fill a list of three Wall Street criminals that the Obama Justice Department actually sent to jail. Heck, they couldn't fill a list of one!</p> <p>\"This is despite Eric Holder telling students at Columbia University in February of this year that his Justice Department's record of success on fighting financial fraud crimes 'has been nothing less than historic.' But not historic enough that his boss could point to, well, one Wall Street criminal behind bars as a result of DoJ's actions.</p> <p>That's painfully telling. Nobody from Bank of America or Wells Fargo or Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs or Bear Stearns or Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch or even Countrywide or Ameriquest was available to stand in as a 'glutton of greed' in this advertisement. Literally no major figure responsible for the financial crisis has gone to jail. So the campaign has to use two CEOs from a decade-old accounting scandal, and a garden-variety Ponzi schemer.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And now, the US supreme court <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/supreme-court-isnt-bothered-nsas-warrantless-wiretapping/57791/\">just consecrated</a> one of the most corrupt acts of the US government over the past decade: its vesting of retroactive legal immunity in the nation's telecom giants after they had been caught red-handed violating multiple US eavesdropping laws. Just as the Obama DOJ forever precluded any legal accountability for Bush-era torturers, the supreme court on Tuesday <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57529255-83/supreme-court-closes-door-on-warrantless-eavesdropping-suit/\">forever precluded any legal accountability</a> for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and other telecoms for their crucial participation in the illegal Bush NSA warrantless eavesdropping program (the Obama DOJ, needless to say, supported the position of the telecoms).</p> <p>When the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pagewanted=all\">revealed</a> on 16 December 2005 that the Bush administration was spying on the telephone calls and emails of American citizens without the warrants required by the criminal law, it exposed lawbreaking not only by government officials but also by the nation's largest telecoms. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/nsa/statutes.pdf\">Multiple laws were in place</a> at the time imposing both criminal and civil liability on telecoms for enabling government spying on the communications of their customers without warrants or other legal authority, and that is exactly what these telecoms did. One former AT&amp;T employee, Mark Klein, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/07/AR2007110700006.html\">publicly described</a> how AT&amp;T had even built a separate room with no purpose but to permit the National Security Agency unfettered access to all of its customers' communications.</p> <p>What was most remarkable about <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/nsa/statutes.pdf\">those telecom laws</a> is that - in the wake of the mid-1970s Church Committee investigation finding that the government abused its spying powers to punish and monitor dissidents - those laws were expressly written to prevent telecoms from participating in illegal government spying. They were written with the full participation of telecom lawyers to ensure that the companies' obligations were crystal clear. And most amazingly of all, the laws already contained broad immunity clauses to ensure that telecoms could never be punished for \"good faith\" violations, but rather only for deliberate, knowing violations of the law.</p> <p>When civil liberties groups sued the telecoms on behalf of their customers whose communications had been illegally accessed by the government, federal courts <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2007/10/18/17048/leahy-fisa-cave/\">began ruling against the telecoms</a>, holding that the immunity they already had under the law would be unavailable to them, because the allegations against them amounted to knowing, deliberate violations of the law. As one federal judge put it in refusing to dismiss a lawsuit against AT&amp;T: \"AT&amp;T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal.\"</p> <p>But in the US, large and powerful actors must not be and are not subject to the rule of law. So telecoms <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/09/newsweek-secret-lobbying-campaign-your-phone-company-doesnt-want-you-know-about\">hired former government officials</a> from both parties to lobby for them and poured money into the coffers of key Democratic Senators <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/10/dem-pushing-spy/\">such as Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller</a> (who became the chief advocate of telecom immunity).</p> <p>In 2008, the industry obtained an extraordinary act of Congress that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/21/AR2007102101041.html\">gave them the gift of retroactive immunity</a> from all criminal and civil liability for their participation in the illegal eavesdropping programs aimed at Americans on US soil. The immunity was enacted by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, with the support of leading Democrats including Barack Obama, who <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/22/moveon-obama-must-keep-hi_n_108514.html\">had promised</a> - when seeking his party's nomination - to filibuster any bill that contained retroactive telecom immunity.</p> <p>Immediately after this immunity was vested, groups which had been suing the telecoms and had their lawsuits terminated by the law, such as Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the ACLU, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/10/17\">challenged the constitutionality of this immunity</a>. They argued, among other things, that retroactive telecom immunity \"violates the federal government's separation of powers as established in the Constitution\" (by having Congress rather than courts resolve cases in favor of telecoms and by allowing executive branch officials full discretion as to which telecoms should be immunized), and \"robs innocent telecom customers of their rights without due process of law\" (by retroactively barring them from seeking justice in court for the violations of their legal rights). </p> <p>Federal courts, needless to say, rejected these claims, dismissed the lawsuits against the telecoms, and upheld the validity of telecom immunity. It was these decisions that the supreme court on Tuesday refused to review, thus forever shielding lawbreaking telecoms from any legal accountability. Thus, the same tribunal that regularly consigns ordinary, powerless Americans to prison for decades for even trivial offenses yet again acts to protect the most powerful actors from any consequences for serious crimes: that is the US justice system in a nutshell.</p> <p>As usual, it is not only the executive branch, Congress and courts which enable this elite immunity, but also the nation's establishment media, which obscures and distorts these issues with flagrantly misleading claims. Yesterday, for instance, CNN <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/09/justice/court-surveillance/index.html\">purported to report</a> on the supreme court's decision, and told its readers that what \"civil libertarians\" were objecting to was eavesdropping on \"potential terrorists\" [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday left in place a law that allows the Justice Department to stop suits against telecommunications companies for <em>participating in wiretaps of potential terrorists</em>.</p> <p>\"The ruling was a key setback for civil libertarians challenging the broader powers of government since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States to use electronic surveillance to track potential threats in the name of national security. . . . </p> <p>\"In this case, Verizon Communications, Sprint Nextel, and AT&amp;T were <em>accused of privacy violations</em> by assisting the government with intelligence gathering following the hijack attacks on New York and Washington.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is all patently misleading. Nobody has ever objected to eavesdropping on \"potential terrorists\"; nobody objects to the \"use [of] electronic surveillance to track potential threats in the name of national security\"; and certainly nobody claims there are \"privacy violations\" from eavesdropping on terrorists. </p> <p>The issue is and always has been <em>illegality</em>, not eavesdropping. The objection is not to government eavesdropping itself, but to government eavesdropping in violation of the law, by spying without the court warrants required by that law, a law that <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1809\">made it a felony</a> - punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each offense - to eavesdrop on Americans without first obtaining permission from a court. Moreover, the problem is not that government spying took place against \"potential terrorists\" but that the communications of <em>all Americans</em> were swept up.</p> <p>George Bush tried to distort objections to his illegal eavesdropping program into objections to \"eavesdropping on the terrorists\", and here we have CNN in its headline and lede perpetuating that same claim. The CNN article does eventually note that \"the law had previously required the government to justify a national security interest before any phone calls and emails originating in another country could be monitored\", that \"a federal judge had to sign any search warrant\" and that \"Bush secretly suspended that requirement following the attacks\" (Bush did not \"secretly suspend that requirement but rather \"secretly broke the law\": presidents do not have the power to \"suspend laws\": that's called \"breaking the law\"). </p> <p>Despite those caveats, the CNN headline and the lede of the article give the clear impression that the objections are to eavesdropping on terrorists, something no sane or rational person could oppose:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397519809\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878525645/cnn.png\" alt=\"cnn telecoms\" width=\"460\" height=\"377\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So congratulations are once again in order for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and the other national telecom giants. In a country that imprisons more of its ordinary citizens than any other on the planet by far, and that imposes more unforgiving punishments than any other western nation, our most powerful corporate actors once again find total impunity even for the most serious of lawbreaking.</p> <h2>Skepticism of US journalists</h2> <p>Relating to all of this, I had what I considered to be a quite revealing Twitter exchange this morning with the New York Times' Matthew Rosenberg, who covers Afghanistan for that paper. Rosenberg intervened in a discussion of US drones in Pakistan by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrosenbergNYT/status/256025144877805568\">vehemently</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrosenbergNYT/status/256024348471721985\">denouncing</a> the Pakistani government for \"outright, unabashed lies\", and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrosenbergNYT/status/256024635559247872\">then arguing</a>: \"it's problematic to base analysis off statements from [a government] that repeatedly misleads in public.\"</p> <p>When I asked him whether he would apply those same notes of skepticism to the US government, he repeatedly refused to answer, both in response to my question and those from others. He just kept insisting that the issue was irrelevant. But how could it possibly be that Pakistan's propensity to lie is relevant to the drone debate, but the US government's propensity to do so is irrelevant? That's particularly striking given the <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/07/18/washingtons-untrue-claims-no-civilian-deaths-in-pakistan-drone-strikes/\">clear documentation</a> that top US government officials have lied about US drones. I have posted all the relevant Twitter comments <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/10/twitter-exchange-with-nyts-matthew.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>Apparently, like so many US journalists, Rosenberg is quite willing and eager to publicly denounce foreign government leaders as liars and to insist that their statements on drones must be taken with great skepticism, but - as an American reporter working for a US newspaper writing about US policy - he refuses to say the same about his own government (he did eventually say that all government claims should be treated with skepticism). Rosenberg has actually done some good journalism, but that double standard perfectly captures the role many establishment journalism plays in the US.</p>",
  "<p>Being part of a company that develops enterprise mobile applications, I am aware of the level of difficulty that one faces in deploying applications to the various mobile platforms. iOS is much more challenging than Android. If you were to compare the two in terms of the marketplace approval process, iOS is the maximum security prison while Android is a half million acre nature preserve; the former has the hatches battened down, while the latter is free, wild, and open. When it comes to the Android marketplace approval process, there is lots of opportunity to for 'creative' code to enter the system.</p> <p>Knowing that Android will accept and publish most any application almost instantly, I was a little surprised this week to find myself involved in a conversation where the other party confidently stated how secure they felt Android was based on the fact that they had never opened an app they didn't know beforehand. To which my response was \"but don't you also have an antivirus/malware app?\" The response was, \"no, but I obsessively check the requested permissions for apps.\" Now, I don't want turn this into a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) article, but I do however, want to use this opportunity to discuss the importance and value of basic security on such mobile (pun intended) and connected devices.</p> <p>For all intents and purposes, the Android App Marketplace is an un-curated process, meaning apps don't undergo rigorous scrutiny before being publicly available for download. This makes the platform a much easier target for dubious apps \u2013 the lower the fence; the easier it is to step over it. And with Android's popularity in the mobile ecosystem, it makes it that much more of a tempting target.</p> <p>During an install, Android does warn users about what data and services an app wants access to. However, for the average user, this is fairly meaningless. It is the mobile equivalent of <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/user-account-control\">UAC on a PC</a>. Most people just click 'ok' without trying to understand what is going on and the consequences of doing so. Better yet, when it comes to dialogs such as UAC, most people just want to know how to turn the darn thing off! If I had nefarious tendencies and awareness that many users mindlessly click 'ok', I would be all over pushing apps to Android. Reliance upon the end user's knowledge and understanding is a bad security practice.</p> <p>As mobile platforms march toward computing dominance, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/22/exploit-uses-firewalls-to-hijack-smartphones/\">more sophisticated exploits</a> will continue to emerge. Relying upon yourself to check permissions will only get you so far. As well, the average user doesn't have the knowledge or time to pay attention to permissions \"obsessively\". Yes, there are those of you out there who are very knowledgeable and understand how to leverage this information. But there are many who do not. Even if you do understand permissions, I would bet good money that there are people out there who will find other ways around the system.</p> <p>The other challenge in staying ahead of malware is you have to constantly stay on top of exploits. Unless you are in the security industry, you don't/won't have time for this either. Increased popularity will bring an increased number of exploits. Your time could be better spent on more productive tasks. Better to leave it to a security company whose success is tied to staying on top of such information.</p> <p>If we are serious about a paradigm shift to mobility, our attitudes towards mobile viruses, spyware, and trojans should reflect that seriousness as well. We should not be cavalier and cocky about our knowledge of an OS as a line of defense. Mobile security doesn't even have to cost you. <a href=\"https://www.mylookout.com/\">Lookout has a free app</a> available for download. We should not approach security on a mobile platform any differently than we would on a desktop. Are you going to invest the time to obsessively check permissions and stay on top of exploits? I can think of better things to do with my time.</p> <p><strong><em>Benjamin Robbins is a principal at Palador \u2013 he blogs regularly at remotelymobileblog.com and can be followed on Twitter @PaladorBenjamin</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Power, as everyone knows, abhors a vacuum, and there is a whopping big one in Birmingham this week. That it is filled by Boris Johnson comes as no surprise to anyone \u2013 but he could park a London bus in it, so huge is the gaping hole where you would expect to find a frontbench team. It really is the strangest thing \u2013 a four-day conference held by an invisible government \u2013 like a party whose own hosts fail to show.</p> <p>Normally you would see cabinet ministers everywhere, flanked by aides in busy little clusters of self-importance, striding about from fringe meetings to&#xa0;media parties, occasionally even mingling with party members. Not this week. The fringe speakers are mostly backbenchers or junior ministers you have never heard of \u2013 and that's if you are lucky; quite often it is just their private parliamentary secretary. The only senior figure much in evidence is Ken Clarke \u2013 but given that everyone knows David Cameron can't&#xa0;control him, his ubiquity merely amplifies the suspicion of a three-line whip ordering frontbenchers to keep their heads down.</p> <p>Equally conspicuous by their absence are the beautiful people. For some City bankers and Knightsbridge ladies who lunch, the Tory party conference is a social fixture of the season, and they can usually be spotted around the hotel bars, expensively dressed and aggressively groomed, lending a certain glamour to proceedings. Two years ago, they were everywhere \u2013 but here, in the mid-term doldrums, they have vanished, leaving only the party's hardcore of policy wonks, ideologues and true believers.</p> <p>Every party looks slightly scary when reduced to its rump, and in the Tories' case the look is particularly alarming. There are the angular, curiously pointy young men in three-piece suits, with staring eyes and towering foreheads, and chins that either jut out abruptly or do not appear to exist. There are alice-band girls in pearls with horsey laughs, bald middle-aged dandies in pinstripe, and the pensioners in blazers with features permanently fixed into expressions of sharp suspicion. These are the party's loyal, true-blue members \u2013 and they are emphatically not modernisers.</p> <p>Those who had wanted to believe in modernisation seem to be struggling to remember why they had ever bought into it. A middle-aged pair from the Midlands don't want to sound disloyal, but can't hide their disappointment. \"Why are we sending aid to India when&#xa0;they've got more money than us?\" puzzles the woman. The man is bewildered by gay marriage.</p> <p>\"I don't know why they are so obsessed about something that affects so few of our voters. Why are we worried about it?\" He shakes his head. \"I look around me at people who are Conservative voters. They are deeply religious, and we are attacking the basis of that. They live in the green belt; we are kicking the green belt. I look at one thing after another and I think: how is this going to bring out the grassroots voters at the election? We need a return to Conservative values.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think David Cameron is a proper Tory,\" she agrees. \"To be honest, if I was given the choice I would want William Hague back.\"</p> <p>\"All I would say,\" he offers glumly, \"is&#xa0;definitely not George Osborne. And I would not have said that two years ago.\"</p> <p>The hall is less than full and ominously stony when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shares-rights-scheme\" title=\"\">Osborne delivers his speech</a>. Like a once-promising employee summoned to explain a disastrous performance, the chancellor is heard out more in sorrow than in anger, by rows of unsmiling faces dark with doubt and disapproval. They know he has no excuse; the applause is dutiful, the chemistry dead. Osborne's speech doesn't end with a standing ovation so much as people half clapping as they stand and head straight for the&#xa0;exits.</p> <p>It's a very different story at an Adam Smith Institute fringe meeting on economic growth later that afternoon. It's not just standing room only \u2013 people can't even squeeze into the room \u2013 but still they hover at the door, hungry for the narcotic blast of high-grade, free-market rhetorical cocaine. \"Remember: low taxes and low spending. If you just remember that,\" urges a speaker, \"a lot of our difficulties will be removed.\" The chair despairs of Osborne's warning that morning to people who don't pay their taxes (\"Why is tax avoidance a priority?\"). The mantra is&#xa0;relentless: cut taxes, cut spending, roll back the state.</p> <p>Only a few years ago this sort of session had been exiled to the fringes of the fringe, confined to diehard followers of John Redwood, but now meetings such as this dominate the week, like a runaway Thatcherite express train hurtling back to the&#xa0;80s.</p> <p>Every party conference can become a bit of a parallel universe, safe behind its G4S security cordon, but this takes the bubble mentality to a whole new level. In the real world outside, austerity is hurting and voters are complaining about cuts, but here inside most people put the government's problems down to being too wet and leftwing. A <a href=\"http://www.populus.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Populus</a> fringe meeting delivers an avalanche of bad news about the party's poll ratings, but to a&#xa0;half-empty room; in previous years, when the polling news was good, the Populus meeting was always well attended. Now the party doesn't seem keen to hear what voters think of them.</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/08/archbishop-canterbury-gay-marriage-tory\" title=\"\">anti-gay marriage rally</a>, on the other hand, is packed and excitable to the point of pantomime, with Widdecombe on her feet conducting the audience from the stage. \"Is that how we want our country to look?\" she&#xa0;trills. \"No!\" everyone roars. \"This is not an anti-gay rally, it is defining marriage full stop!\" she shrieks. \"Yes!\"&#xa0;everyone cheers.</p> <p>Afterwards, I speak to a very tall, incredibly gentle elderly man from London, and ask why he thinks Cameron is so determined to force this&#xa0;unpopular policy on his party. \"I&#xa0;really don't know,\" he ponders softly, bemused. \"But the Tory party is obsessed with trying to be modern. It&#xa0;goes in a sort of sequence: to start off, you mustn't be prejudiced against BME [black and minority ethnic] people. Then women. Then it leads to the homosexuals. But you can't help being BME or a woman. Whether or not you can help being born with a homosexual orientation I don't know, but it <em>is</em> possible to refrain from practising. To be honest, I'm more or less bisexual myself. I find women attractive but men easier to get on with. I've never married. But I abstain. It is possible, you know.\"</p> <p>He joined the Young Conservatives in 1953, but if the policy goes through he will resign. \"I'm just not sure that David Cameron is a true Tory,\" he reflects sadly. \"The Old Etonian guard tend to be more leftwing than the people like David Davis who came up the hard way. Personally, I'd have Michael Gove as prime minister, with David Willetts as chancellor.\" Does he think his party will win the next election? \"Oh no, dear,\" and he gently shakes his head. \"I&#xa0;think we won't.\"</p> <p><em>Everyone</em> I meet thinks the party will lose the next election. The only person who keeps insisting they'll win is Boris \u2013 who everyone knows must be hoping they won't, so I'm not sure that his prediction counts. But then everything about Boris assumes a fantastical quality this week. Queues for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/boris-johnson-conservative-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">his rally</a> begin more than an hour before the doors open, and the hall erupts into rock-concert cheers at the mere sight of his face on a warm up video. (The film is promoting international aid; Louise Mensch's face comes up next, and is loudly booed and hissed; Andrew Mitchell's provokes hearty if&#xa0;ironic hoots.) A young Spectator reporter arrives in a tizz, breathless from the heady thrill of mere proximity to the media scrum outside mobbing Boris. We're shown a video of Boris stunt riding a bike down the steps of Trafalgar Square to a spoof James Bond&#xa0;soundtrack, the words \"Mission: Imborisable\" appear on the screen, and on to the stage bounds the mayor to a delirious standing ovation.</p> <p>He says nothing whatsoever of consequence, and nobody cares; soppy grins are glazed across adoring faces, mesmerised by the mere fact of him. At&#xa0;the end, it's time for questions and, for a few extraordinary moments (this <em>never</em> happens at party conference), not one hand goes up. It's partly down to starstruck awe, I think \u2013 but more to the fact that answers are not the point of Boris. Fans didn't mob the Beatles to&#xa0;hear Paul McCartney's views on deficit reduction.</p> <p>When Boris <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-top-rate-tax\" title=\"\">addresses the main conference the following morning</a>, he&#xa0;sends a frisson through the crowd every time he teases Cameron. Far from posing a threat, I begin to see that he actually functions as a rather useful safety valve, giving dissatisfied Tories the vicarious thrill of dissent so that no&#xa0;one feels the need to mutiny. \"Isn't he marvellous?\" beaming members swoon when it's over. \"We just <em>adore</em> Boris.\" But I don't find anyone who actually wants him to lead the party. \"Er, well, um, no,\" they all say, the smiles fading. \"Not leader, no,\" says one. \"I don't think that would really suit him. He needs to be his own man, that's why we love him so much.\" \"Yes, <em>we</em> love him,\" another agrees. \"I'm just not sure the rest of the world would quite get him. If I picture him at a G8 or&#xa0;something, I don't really see how that could work.\"</p> <p>For all the Borismania headlines of the week, the really important political developments take place far away from the spotlight, in fringe meetings dominated by a new book called Britannia Unchained. Published by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">a new rightwing parliamentary faction</a>, the Free Enterprise Group, it calls for neo-Thatcherite free-market liberalisation on a scale that would probably make the Iron Lady blush. Rejecting the European economic model, it invokes global competition from the east to justify what critics call a new right manifesto to turn the UK into South Korea, replacing the welfare state with ruthless Tiger Moms and 90-hour weeks \u2013 but it is clearly being taken very seriously in Downing Street.</p> <p>No 10 didn't want any ministers saying anything too radically rightwing this week in case it upset their Lib Dem partners, hence their absence from the fringe. The ministerial injunction led to the weird impression of an invisible government \u2013 but it created a convenient vacancy for a new generation of MPs to&#xa0;begin the ideological heavy lifting required to move the party to the right.</p> <p>\"We see the chancellor a lot,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/sep/17/kwasi-kwarteng-work-opt-out-culture-video\" title=\"\">Kwasi Kwarteng MP</a>, one of the book's co-authors, tells me. \"He knows what we are saying. He gets it. It's very tempting in a democracy for everyone to congregate around the status quo\" \u2013 the centre ground \u2013 \"so it's quite useful for a Tory chancellor to have people like us saying: 'No, this is actually what we want to see.' He is very interested in us. We can push the debate in ways he feels too constrained to do.\"</p> <p>I don't think he is boasting. In Osborne's speech there is a revealing line \u2013 \"Western democracies like ours are being out-worked \u2013 are we going to sink or swim? Some western economies won't catch up\" \u2013 and when Cameron delivers the closing speech of the conference, there it is again: \"We are in a global race today. Sink or swim. Do or decline.\" Cameron's repeated references to \"hard work\" echo the words of another Britannia Unchained co-author, Dominic Raab MP, whose relentless message this week is \"hard graft\".</p> <p>As the party pours out of the hall and heads off home, there is the traditional post-leader's speech elation among the membership, and everyone is happy. For the first time all week, people tell me they think they can win in 2015. \"Inspirational\" \"Magnificent.\" \"Amazing.\" Everyone mentions Cameron's defence of welfare cuts as a highlight, and when I run into the woman I'd met from the Midlands earlier in the week, she agrees, \"I thought it was a really good speech. He picked up key Tory issues like welfare.\" Then she frowns, and adds, \"These things are easy to say, but will he deliver on them?\"</p> <p>Philip Blond, founder of the centrist thinktank ResPublica and author of Red Tory, looks less impressed. \"It was a Thatcherite speech to a Thatcherite party, so it secured his base. But I don't think it spoke to the country.\"</p> <p>Very little is left now of the Cameroon modernisation project except gay rights; even the party's logo, once an eco-friendly green tree, has been rebranded in red, white and blue to resemble a union flag. I don't find a single member who supports gay marriage, but I ask the man I meet at the anti-gay marriage rally if he can't at least see its value as&#xa0;the last surviving signifier of the party's detoxification.</p> <p>\"Oh no,\" he blinks in surprise. \"Oh no, I'm all in favour of re-toxifying the brand. In fact, I nearly got someone to&#xa0;make me a badge saying The&#xa0;Nasty&#xa0;Party.\"</p> <p>If the Tories keep heading to the right at this rate, by next year he shouldn't need to.</p>",
  "<p>Barring something extraordinary, Rory McIlroy will still be afforded an afternoon on the beach alongside Caroline Wozniacki. The world's No1 golfer has, though, been denied a full day of sun, sea, sand and romance on account of the storm which battered Antalya on Wednesday lunchtime.</p> <p>McIlroy's morning loss to a revitalised Charl Schwartzel means the Northern Irishman requires something in the realms of the highly unlikely to progress to the semi-finals of the Turkish Airlines World Golf Final. Namely, a significant win over Tiger Woods in combination with a similarly heavy victory for Schwartzel when he meets Matt Kuchar.</p> <p>Those ties should have taken place on Wednesday afternoon but Mother Nature decreed otherwise. Within merely half an hour, rain had fallen to such an extent that areas of the Sultan Course were unplayable, thunder cracked overhead and the tournament's media centre was evacuated on safety grounds.</p> <p>One benefit of an eight-man field is flexibility. Hence players will return to play their last round of group matches on Thursday morning before proceeding to the semi-finals. The final is scheduled for Friday.</p> <p>\"It looks like I'll get to spend a day on the beach tomorrow, which will be nice,\" McIlroy said after his 71 was beaten by Schwartzel's 70. \"It was actually a decent match. I felt like I played a bit better today, had plenty of chances and just didn't really hole much.</p> <p>\"I got off to a better start and Charl played solid and then birdied three of the last four so I couldn't really do much about&#xa0;that.\"</p> <p>Woods has more legitimate aspirations of progression after an impressive 67 on the tight, tree-lined course proved five strokes better than Kuchar. A rare match between Woods and McIlroy, regardless of what is at stake, still has to be readily anticipated by anyone in attendance. \"I'll try and keep him out of those semi-finals,\" McIlroy insisted. \"I'm sure that's not what the tournament wants but it's what I'm going to try to do.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere on Wednesday, Justin Rose's 66 defeated Lee Westwood while Webb Simpson carded 65 \u2013 the lowest score of the event so far \u2013 to see off Hunter Mahan by two.</p> <p>Before inclement conditions set in, there had also been confirmation that the Turkish Open will be played in Antalya as a sanctioned European Tour event for three years from November 2013. The format will return to strokeplay for a 78-man field, with the strong possibility of a return to the country for Woods.</p> <p>There was an apology, too, from the head of the Turkish Golf Federation for his role in a fracas with a local journalist and cameraman on day one of the World Final. Ahmet Agaoglu has denied headbutting the reporter but admitted pushing him. \"While organising such tournaments I shouldn't have to be there, but I am trying to make everything so perfect,\" Agaoglu said. \"It was unlucky it happened and I will give a written apology because one way or another it was not nice.\"</p> <p>Darren Clarke, meanwhile, has distanced himself from a report which claimed he is already nailed-on to be Europe's Ryder Cup captain in 2014. There is now a very strong likelihood of the Northern Irishman being handed that role, with Westwood's public support of Clarke's candidature particularly significant.</p> <p>Informal background talks are thought to have taken place on the subject but Clarke used his Twitter account to dismiss any notion of a fait accompli. He said: \"To clarify, I have not been offered the Ryder Cup captaincy. It's not decided by the committee until January. Would be a huge honour if asked.\"</p> <p>Richard Hills, Europe's Ryder Cup director, added: \"No decision on the European captain for the 2014 Ryder Cup has been taken and none will be taken until the tournament committee next meets.\"</p>",
  "<p>Celebrated Israeli novelist David Grossman is working with <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=270241\" title=\"\">Boualem Sansal</a>, an award-winning Algerian writer who came under harsh criticism for visiting Jerusalem earlier this year, to launch a writers' drive for peace which calls among other things for a halt to the \"inhuman and immoral\" situation in Israel.</p> <p>Supported by some of international literature's most respected names, including Claudio Magris, Antonio Lobo Antunes and Liao Yiwu, <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/nscentre/Appel_trilingue.asp\" title=\"\">the authors will present their appeal at the closing session of the World Forum for Democracy on Thursday</a>. Their document states that there is still a \"possible solution\" for the Israel-Palestine conflict, where \"Israel has maintained the Palestinians under occupation for more than 45 years\", but \"but maybe not for long\". The writers are therefore pushing for a Palestinian state to be created next to Israel, both with secure borders, \"on the basis of painful compromises for both parties \u2026 such as the abandonment of settlements or their exchange for land, the renouncement of the right of return of the 1948 refugees, the sharing of Jerusalem\".</p> <p>Sansal, whose books are banned in Algeria but who has won prizes for his work in France and <a href=\"http://www.friedenspreis-des-deutschen-buchhandels.de/445941/?mid=446033\" title=\"\">took the German book trade peace prize last year</a>, met Grossman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/20/syria.comment\" title=\"\">whose son, Uri, was killed in 2006 when a missile struck his tank in southern Lebanon</a>, in May when he travelled to Jerusalem for an international literary festival. The <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/boualem-sansal/je-suis-alle-a-jerusalem_b_1539894.html\" title=\"\">threats and criticism he received for going to Israel</a> led him to the idea of gathering writers to speak up for peace in the world. \"Before I went to Jerusalem I came in for a lot of harassment [but] I did not let it intimidate me,\" Sansal told the Guardian. \"I decided to go to Jerusalem anyway, to mobilise people. Our enemies are organised, but we are not. Our way of fighting is literature, it's meeting, it's dialogue. We need to fight with these things.\"</p> <p>The appeal from the authors, who include Daniel Pennac, Tomi Ungerer and Peter Esterhazy, also states that it is \"urgent\" that the international community \"intervenes firmly to bring the Iranian nuclear programme under control\", warning that Iran is accelerating \"its nuclear programme to achieve its hegemonic pretensions on a political, military and religious level, and Arab countries in the region might be driven to follow a similar path\".</p> <p>In Syria, meanwhile, \"the Arab Spring has resulted in a crisis of exceptional severity, which threatens the country itself and its people's very existence\". \"Al-Assad's regime is methodically killing his people. Sixteen months \u2013 and almost 30,000 deaths \u2013 after the start of the Syrian revolution, he continues his crimes in complete tranquillity, encouraged firstly by Iran, Russia and China, and secondly by the hesitations and procrastination of the international community. Human consciousness will long remember the aftermath of this tragedy,\" they write.</p> <p>Laying out their belief that \"peace is a common and irreplaceable good and its defence is a common obligation\", the authors are urging \"all writers in the world\" to join them. \"Together, we can influence decision makers and public opinion and thereby also the course of events, ensuring that the values of peace are strengthened throughout the world. Our methods in this fight are literature, debate and vigilance,\" they say.</p> <p>Sansal believes hundreds of writers will join the cause over the coming months. \"In the long term I think we can change things. In the short term not really \u2013 it needs three centuries to change things. But if there are writers from many countries who are part of this, then I think that can help. And in the context of today, the young are disoriented. They don't know why they take an extremist route. We must give them a sense of something else, which is not violent, not about hate. I think if there are enough of us, we can make a change, and we are growing every day,\" he said. \"We are lots of writers gathering together and fighting for democracy. Often in this world we are not direct, but we want to be frank, and sincere, to say things clearly \u2026 We will make plans, go to London, New York, Moscow, carry the good word, become more numerous, and talk, talk, talk, talk. That can help, I think. In two or three years, that can help.\"</p> <p>The authors' next move will be to set up working groups to look at how best to address the most urgent situations. Sansal expects criticism for what the group is saying about Israel, but believes that \"the great majority\" of Israelis and Palestinians believe peace will be achieved through the creation of two states, diverging only on how this can be achieved. \"The role of the writers would focus on this: trying to create a dynamic which promotes dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian society, help them to meet, to debate, to know each other, to take the heat out of the debate, to change, will be our role in the affair.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a> is one of the literary organisations helping to spread the appeal around the world. \"It's an unbelievably brave thing to do,\" said director Nick Barley of Grossman and Sansal's project. \"Boualem met David Grossman and they realised that together, someone from Israel and someone from an Arab country could form a really powerful voice. They decided they had an obligation [to do it].\"</p> <p>Barley said that \"an Israeli writer calling for the creation of a Palestinian state is going to get into a lot of trouble at home, so Grossman's taking a huge personal risk standing up and saying this, as is Boualem Sansal by going to Israel and collaborating with an Israeli writer. This is something very special. They're going to the highest diplomatic places, and want to get the support of other writers, because they believe writers have a voice and can make a difference.\"</p> <p>Sansal said it would be \"important to see who joins us, and who refuses to join us\". But Samir El-youssef, a Palestinian writer, said he would not be signing up. \"As a Palestinian writer who for the last two decades believed in upholding the hope for peace, especially when despair and cynicism are prevalent, I should applaud this proposal and indeed scurry to join its initiators. Sadly I shan't,\" he said. \"Rather than maintaining hope for peace, I see here nothing but a further attempt to renew the old failed approach to deal with the Arabic and Islamic world. The implication that the Iranians are more belligerent then the Israelis is a pathetic lie; just review the history of the Middle East in the last three decades and tell me how many countries have Iran invaded and how many Israel?\"</p> <p>El-youssef said there was a \"desperate need for any kind of proposal or writers' gathering to renew the hope for peace in the Middle East and many other places\", but that \"such hope cannot be upheld at this stage by organising an intellectual orgy against Iran, but rather by encouraging honest confrontation of the politics of one's own country and one's own beliefs, especially regarding others\".</p>",
  "<p>The relentless march of technology is perhaps the best highlight of the blocks and opportunities to creating a more sustainable future.</p> <p>I was reminded of this following a visit to New York's <a href=\"http://www.newmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">New Museum</a> and the <a href=\"http://sxsweco.com/\" title=\"\">SXSW Eco</a> conference in Austin, Texas last week.</p> <p>The New Museum is holding an exhibition called Ghosts in the Machine, which includes artists, writers, and visionaries whose works have explored the fears and aspirations generated by the technology of their time.</p> <p>The recreation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Vanderbeek\" title=\"\">Stan VanDerBeek's Movie-Drome</a> (1963\u201366), is an illustration of how technology can be a negative force.</p> <p>Lying down inside a large sphere, one is bombarded by a stream of moving images and a cacophony of sounds, ranging from fighting robots, screaming children, naked women, Nazi storm troopers and astronauts in space.</p> <p>Stumbling out into the sombre quiet of the main exhibition space feels like escaping madness itself.</p> <p>It's a great illustration of how the rise of global communications and the Internet is pumping out a torrent of information that often leads to mis-information, confusion and exhaustion.</p> <p>That's only part of the story. More important is how advances in technology have largely been responsible for creating our unsustainable, globalised economy and a consumerist and agricultural monoculture.</p> <p>Dr Vandana Shiva <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/vandana-shiva-corporate-monopoly-seeds\" title=\"\">wrote this week</a> for Guardian Sustainable Business, accusing large corporations of creating \"seed slavery\" via genetic engineering and patents.</p> <p>At the SXSW Eco conference , there were other examples highlighted. The American environmentalist and author <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mckibben-bill\" title=\"\">Bill McKibben</a>, talked of how the development of natural gas fracking is virtually killing the market for renewable energy in the US by undercutting its business model.</p> <p>\"It is clear at this point that fracking cheap gas is not the bridge to the future but pushing the rickety pier further into the carbon lake,\" he said.</p> <p>But as much as technology is making things difficult, it also offers some powerful solutions for sustainability. One example highlighted at SXSW Eco is how the Internet is facilitating small scale food producers, distributors and retailers to develop more effective joint networks.</p> <p>Technological developments are also leading to innovations across business, such as Nike's waterless dyeing system. One focus at SXSW Eco was of a growing awareness of the importance of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/guardian-live-discussion-biomimicry-sustainable-green-design\" title=\"\">biomimicry</a>, which examines nature, its models, systems, processes, and elements, to emulate or take inspiration from in order to solve problems.</p> <p>Lance Hosey, chief sustainability officer of architectural practice <a href=\"http://www.rtkl.com/\" title=\"\">RTKL</a> talked, for example, of how scientists are studying anthills in Africa that are able to maintain the same temperature inside, regardless of whether it is blazing hot or freezing cold.</p> <p>Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the <a href=\"http://thebreakthrough.org/\" title=\"\">Breakthrough Institute</a>, is a particular advocate for the power of technology to save us from ourselves. He said: \"There are profound questions as to how are we going to preserve some parts of our natural heritage and keep changes in planetary temperature within a certain range.</p> <p>\"The only way you do that is by building, brick by brick, an entirely new energy and agricultural economy. Technology is the solution, not the problem. There is no path through without radical technological innovation.\"</p> <p>Economist Diane Coyle, author of the <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9402.html\" title=\"\">Economics of Enough</a>, is another believer that technology holds the key, but she is concerned that it could also further embed power in the hands of small elites.</p> <p>In an interview for the Guardian Sustainable Businesses' Enough is not Enough video series, which will air on the site in the coming weeks, she says: \"Think about mobile phones which seemed like yuppie toys when they first emerged but actually are absolutely transformative in developing economies. So technology, that kind of innovation that comes with technology is the force for good.</p> <p>\"I also think the risks are about power and inequality \u2026 That's a battle that is currently being played out and I wouldn't want to predict what the outcome of that is going to be. Because we are in an economy with lots of concentrated power, the economic elites are extraordinarily powerful. Just look at how little banking and financial reform there has been given a crisis on this scale, I find it absolutely extraordinary but that's a measure of embedded power in the economy and technology could embed that even further.\"</p> <p>Given its dualistic nature, what can be done to maximise technology's benefits, while also minimising its risks?</p> <p>A number of speakers at SXSW Eco talked of the importance of citizens combining to hold corporations and regulators to account to prevent technology getting out of control.</p> <p>McKibben talked about how the Internet had facilitated the expansion of <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a>, the global movement to tackle climate change he co-founded, now present all over the world despite having a tiny core team.</p> <p>Food activist and best selling author <a href=\"http://smallplanet.org/about/anna/bio\" title=\"\">Anna Lappe</a> said large companies could not be expected to take the lead because they are so embedded in the current economic system of profit maximisation.</p> <p>She told me: \"The only way is to look at what has been successful in the past, which is for people to come together to organise for change and to force corporations to do the right thing by calling them to account.\"</p> <p>She gives the example of the success in stopping regulators in the US from allowing irradiated food and crops grown with the aid of sewage sludge from being included in the organic certification standard.</p> <p>Annie Leonard, co-director of the <a href=\"http://www.storyofstuff.org/\" title=\"\">Story of Stuff Project</a>, spoke of how there needs to be a move away from consumer action to citizen action, suggesting that people had focussed too much on trying to change their own personal habits, rather than the system.</p> <p>While holding power to account is an important component of ensuring technology does not become a destructive force, companies also have a responsibility for ensuring they do not overstep the mark.</p> <p>I recently interviewed the co-chairman of <a href=\"http://www.infosys.com/pages/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Infosys</a>, Senapathy Gopalakrishnan, and he talked of the importance of focussing not only on the benefits of technology, but also their unintended consequences.</p> <p>Gopalakrishnan says that while technology can benefit all of our lives, it also has the capacity to create harm. He gives the crude example that electricity can light up our lives and also kill us.</p> <p>\"It is human beings who decide how to leverage technology and where to put limits,\" he says. \"So it is important we understand the power and benefits as well as the problems technology can create.</p> <p>\"If you look at the challenges facing humanity today such as climate change and poverty and water scarcity, they all need answers from using technology, but we have to be very careful we look at any unintended consequences. We have to control technology rather than letting technology control us.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>This fall the Guardian's Gary Younge has been speaking with voters across the country about how the Obama presidency has impacted their lives since the historic 2008 election.</p> <p>While Gary is driving from Roanoke, Virginia to Akron, Ohio to Albuquerque, New Mexico and beyond, we are conducting similar interviews with Guardian readers online. What we hope to learn is how peoples' personal circumstances may or may not impact their vote. </p> <p>Last week we asked readers to provide a snapshot of their lives in 2008 and today. Today we are publishing the first of what we expect to be several 'Then vs Now' people's panels.</p> <p><strong>Then vs Now is an ongoing effort. Each week in the lead up to the election we'll publish more readers' stories.

I voted for Obama in the last election because I hoped that something would be done about the sudden collapse of the middle class. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Since the financial meltdown I lost my home and had to leave the city I had lived for 35 years. My lifestyle has changed completely, going from having people I knew around me to coming to a town where I knew hardly anyone. I still will vote for Obama because this mess was created by and still goes on by the party of No. </p> <h2>'I'm surviving', Neal, Jersey City, New Jersey</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603948\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878429537/Neal-Leitner--002.jpg\" alt=\"Neal Leitner \" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neal Leitner  Photograph: Neal Leitner /Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neal Leitner /Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008 I began a new job. It was a promotion in title, not pay. Relocating to New Jersey from California was good for me, I was happy. Settling into a new life was refreshing. I voted for Obama mostly because I knew he could handle the evolving economic crisis better than McCain. I did not expect the world economy to recover from the crisis at all. I'm surprised that we are not in a depression today and I believe Obama and Bernanke are responsible for keeping depression at bay. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Today, I still work at the same job I started in 2008, after surviving multiple layoffs. My pay is lower due to \"pension reform\". The reduction in take home pay due to increased health benefit costs and the loss of collective bargaining rights forced me into bankruptcy a year ago.</p> <p>I joined Occupy Wall Street on day one. I consider myself an activist against Wall Street now. I think about income inequality on a daily basis; being confronted with it in NYC is hard.</p> <p>I am voting for Obama because I see him as a firewall. He is able to block some efforts from corporations and investment firms to erode our lifestyle and freedoms even more than they already have.</p> <h2>'I'm disappointed in Obama', Tom Weber, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603949\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878158765/Tom-Weber-002.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Weber\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Weber Photograph: Tom Weber/Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Weber/Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong>In 2008 I was fully employed as a college teacher. I voted for Obama because he appeared to be a progressive candidate who supported the things that I did \u2013 universal healthcare through a single-payer system, a ratcheting down of military spending, more money for education and the arts. <br> <strong>NOW:</strong> I have been unemployed for over a year, despite having a PhD, 25 years of teaching experience, and many relevant professional skills. I am watching full-time teaching jobs disappear and be replaced with low-paying part-time positions. The gap between the super-rich and the rest of us has widened, enabled by public policies that are bought and paid for by elite individuals and corporations. I am disappointed in Obama, but the alternative is unthinkable. </p> <h2>'My salary is almost back to where it was', Rachel, Portland, Oregon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603950\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878847377/Rachel-Fossy-002.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Fossy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Fossy Photograph: Rachel Fossy/Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Fossy/Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008, I lived in a red state. There was a lot of poverty, a lot of bible thumping, and not very much compassion for the less fortunate. I was concerned about the lack of access to real health care for many Americans, and about how many were under-insured. I voted for Obama because, primarily, I hated the direction the country was going in, particularly for the poor. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> This recession hammered my family \u2013 job loss, loss of value on our home, seven months unemployment, lengthy job searches. Three years after being laid off, my salary is finally back where it was. I will be voting Obama again. I also think Obama has been a great president, has a good grasp on economic matters, and cares about the little guy (more than the reps anyway). </p> <h2>'No president can truly fix a bad economy,' Robert Foster, Williamsburg, Virginia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603951\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/10/1257875916743/Avatar-green-001.jpg\" alt=\"Avatar green\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar green Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong>We both worked and were financially comfortable. We lost a lot money from our portfolio in the crash of '08, but that's been recouped. We voted for Obama more for the social and environmental issues. He hasn't turned out to be quite the man we had hoped he was, but considering the awful alternatives I'm satisfied that we voted the right way. A black president still makes me feel good (I'm white). </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Nothing much has changed materially. Nobody got laid off or fired. We will both vote Obama. No president can truly fix a bad economy, but he can ameliorate it's negative effects if he has a willing Congress. So, it's down to the social issues again. We are concerned about the make-up of the Supreme Court. We fear what might happen to reproductive rights under Romney. We think corporations and wealthy individuals have too much control over our government.</p> <h2>'The impoverishment of the middle class includes those who service them', James Montgomery, New York, New York</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603952\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878293297/James-Montgomery-002.jpg\" alt=\"James Montgomery\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Montgomery Photograph: James Montgomery/Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Montgomery/Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008 I voted for Obama because I believed in health care reform and wanted the two wars to end. My verdict on Obama's first term is that it has been very mediocre. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Since 2008 I have certainly seen my disposable income fall. I am self-employed and my clients are largely individuals and small firms. With the general impoverishment of the middle class also comes the impoverishment of those who service them. I feel that Obama has looked after the huge corporations and banks, that he has been weak and vain and above all cares about how he will be seen by history. I don't know whether I can vote for him again. </p> <h2>'I'm pretty sure I'm receiving rejections from jobs before I've even submitted my application,' Ellen, Minneapolis, Minnesota</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603953\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/10/1257875887351/Avatar-brown-001.jpg\" alt=\"Avatar brown\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar brown Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008 I was in my second year of college, pursuing a liberal arts degree that I enjoyed but I knew wouldn't lead to immediate employment or position me ahead in the job market. I was interested in economic politics as they pertained to college students, things like student loan rates and funding for education. I'm firmly pro-choice and also an LGBTQ ally, so I wanted a candidate to reflect that. I really wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton, and did so in my State's primary, but in the end I voted for Barack Obama. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Since 2008 I have graduated from my undergraduate college and have received a master's degree from a UK university. While I am still concerned with the same issues from 2008, I am also acutely aware that the job market is not favorable. I'm pretty sure I'm receiving rejections from jobs before I've even submitted my application. I don't think Obama is as strong on economics as I would like in a candidate, but Mitt Romney's proposals are far worse. In truth, my middle class parents have had a very good turn with their jobs since Obama took office four years ago. I will be voting for Obama again this year. </p> <h2>'I have never voted, and probably never will', Sean, Boston, Massachusetts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603954\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/13/1258123322843/avatar-blue-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar blue\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar blue Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> I was let go from my job in August in 2007. I supported myself (paying rent and the MA health insurance mandate) by playing online and live poker, and collecting unemployment insurance benefits while sending out 15-20 resumes a week. I didn't vote because I live in MA, and Obama was going to win anyway. He talked tough on big banking and promised to hold the financial sector accountable.</p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> I've had a job for 2.5 years, but it pays crap and the benefits are very poor. I still play live poker, but Obama's DOJ and the Republican Congress banned online poker from the USA, so 25%-50% my potential life earn was scrapped. Obama's Administration, littered with banking lobbyists (after saying he wouldn't do so), has given Wall Street criminals immunity.</p> <p>I don't plan to vote again because it won't change the fact I can't afford to finish college (or get a loan for it) and I can't afford to cut into the remaining debt I already have. The fact is: my situation won't change no matter who I vote for, as well as for most of my peers (minus a few ancillary details). I have never voted, and probably never will.</p> <p><strong>Then vs Now is an ongoing project. We will continue to publish your responses each week leading up to the election.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jun/28/uselections2004.usa\">first time I met Susan Aylward</a>, in 2004, she had just emerged from the opening night of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 in Akron, Ohio, and was shooing away John Kerry supporters who wanted to give her a sticker. She intended to vote for him and she even campaigned for him, but she had no intention of bragging about it. \"People don't love Kerry because they're not sure what he stands for,\" she said. \"But I'm going to vote for him because he's not Bush.\"</p> <p>Four years later she was positively excited at the prospect of an Obama presidency. \"I had high hopes,\" she says. \"After having to live for 8 years through Iraq and all of that stuff I really wanted Obama to be the counterpoint to that. He was a brilliant speaker. Pretty much everything about him made you hopeful. He reminded me of JFK.\"</p> <p>When we met at her house for breakfast <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/01/us-elections2008-barack-obama\">just a week before the 2008 election</a> she was eager to contain her excitement. \"After the last two times I just don't want to jinx it,\" she said. \"Everything looks good. But I won't believe it until it actually happens.\" When he won she made her two-year-old granddaughter, who's mixed race, sit with her and watch the festivities. \"We kept saying: 'It's history, Sasha'. We wanted her to be able to say she saw it that day, even if she didn't really know what she was seeing.\"</p> <p>This time around she feels deflated. You can hear it in her voice as she works through her mixed emotions. It's almost as though she cast a vote for Barack Obama and got Kerry instead. \"It's not going to change my vote,\" she says. \"But I just wish he could have been better. I don't even know how exactly. If you're going to be president then I guess you obviously want to be in the history books. So what does he want to be in the history books for? I don't quite know the answer to that yet.\"</p> <p>There is a peculiar quality to the disappointment among Democrats <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/oct/18/gary-younge-america-obama-mania-video\">when it comes to talk of Obama's first term</a>. Most feel it but few will own it. Some project it, others deflect it. Many are in denial, some are in mourning. They struggle with it, qualify it, rationalise it, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/167344/what-do-we-see-obama\">calibrate it and question it</a>. </p> <p>Did he raise expectations too high or were unreasonable expectations imposed upon him? Was he <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/13/barack-obama-cool-to-cold\">too compliant with the Republican Congress</a> or was he trying to fulfill his promise to be more consensual? They wanted more and they're not sure whether their aspirations were reasonable, feasible, justified or deluded. They wish the disappointment wasn't there. And they can't avoid it.</p> <p>For this is one emotional toll that could have electoral consequences. In a tight race in which there are few undecideds both sides have to galvanise their bases. The Obama campaign has tried trying to manage it, lest the disappointment <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-youngeturnout\">depress enthusiasm and harm</a>. In Charlotte <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\">Obama told the convention</a>: \"While I'm proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said: \"I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.\"</p> <p>Republicans are keen to leverage it, in the hope that with a show of empathy they can win over some precious waverers. Mitt Romney spoke over the heads of his convention-goers to disaffected Obama supporters: \"You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\" Now <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2012/10/06/new-romney-ad-presses-obama-disappointment-theme/\">they are running ads</a>, mostly featuring women, to appeal to swing voters. \"I'm disappointed in Barack Obama as my president,\" says Melanie McNamara, who voted for him in 2008. \"He promised to bring us all together so we could prosper, and I don't see the prospering.\"</p> <p>Given the excitement at Obama's election some measure of disappointment was inevitable. The combination of both the historic nature of both his candidacy and the economic crisis during which it emerged virtually ensured it. The first black president elected during the steepest downturn since the Great Depression <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/24/barack-obama-nic-hillary-clinton\">set the nation on contradictory paths</a>. In Harlem people were dancing in the street even as, at the other end of Manhattan, Wall Street was sending the economy into free fall. The month he was elected \u2013 two months before he took office \u2013 he had a 61% approval rating while only one in six believed the country was heading in the right direction, and it was unlikely one person could correct the course of a tanker the size of the US economy.</p> <h2>'I never thought things could become more divided'</h2> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/believers-great-men-think-alike \">rereading The God That Failed</a>, in which six ex-Marxists voice their disaffection with communism, the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said questioned the very premise in the title. \"Why as an intellectual did you believe in a god anyway? And besides, who gave you the right to imagine that your early belief and later disenchantment were so important?\" One might say the same of some Obama supporters whose investment in him was rooted in an unreasonable belief that the presidency endowed Obama with superhuman powers. \"This is not some academic exercise,\" Obama told supporters in Philadelphia in 2010. \"Don't compare us to the Almighty; compare us to the alternative.\"</p> <p>That's why Susan believes people must, to some extent, take responsibility for their disappointment. \"That's what we're taught to believe from an early age,\" she says. \"That one man should be able to fix everything. Abe Lincoln, George Washington, Ronald Reagan \u2013 history's told as though it were all down to them. The world is way too complex for that, and we know that but we still have those expectations that we were raised with.\"</p> <p>And while some of the expectations may have been unreasonable some were just plain unfounded. On election night in 2008 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/06/uselections2008-usa\">I watched the result come in</a> the President's Lounge on the South Side of Chicago. As Obama was announced the winner a woman at the bar started cheering. \"My man's in Afghanistan. He's coming home.\" Quite why she thought that wasn't clear. But it wasn't true. Afghanistan was the one war Obama had pledged to continue and which he would eventually escalate. Where she'd got the impression otherwise is not clear. But her disappointment was guaranteed and had little to do with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397516241\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879439048/obama-younge-america-010.jpg\" alt=\"obama younge america\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Obama's first acts in January 2009 was to sign an executive order closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

He wasn't. His record both as a state senator and on the national level, where he voted with Hilary Clinton 90% of the time, was of a centrist Democrat. Unlike black presidential candidates of the past, who were unlikely to get white support, he was not standing to advance a broader cause <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/obama-effect\">but to get elected</a>. \"The civil rights generation saw politics as the next step in the struggle for civil rights,\" said Salim Muwakkil, a Chicago-based journalist who has known Obama for many years. \"Their aim was to get their agenda taken up by whoever won. But this new generation do not conceive politics as the next step, but just as what it is \u2013 politics. Their aim is to win.\"</p> <p>But the fact that he didn't stand on a radical platform doesn't mean people were deluded to imagine that he would govern as a radical. In January 2007 I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/feb/10/usa.uselections2008\">saw him speak at George Mason University</a> to a 1,000-plus crowd where he quoted Martin Luther King: \"The arc of justice is long but bends towards justice.\" He promised his presidency would be transformative and in campaign speeches he invoked abolitionists, suffragettes and labour activists and then Will.I.Am <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY\">set it to song</a>. \"Nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change,\" he said. \"We have been asked to pause for a reality check. We have been warned against offering people of this nation false hope.\" One could be forgiven for thinking he wasn't just talking about marginal tax rates and cap and trade.</p> <p>Such were the nature of the aspirations and potential disappointments, both projected onto him and which he projected himself, before he even took office. Then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/19/obama-inauguration\">there is his record</a>. Pretty much everybody has their pet disappointment here: a specific thing they'd wanted to see but haven't or, conversely, wished he hadn't done. Most frequently mentioned are failing to close Guantanamo Bay, political polarisation, drone attacks, comprehensive immigration reform, kill lists and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\"> failing to oversee stronger regulation of the financial sector</a>. It is intriguing how many Obama loyalists explain these problems away with a mixture of psychoanalysis and Donald Rumsfeld's \"unknown unknowns\". </p> <p>\"I know he's smart. I know he's caring,\" says Bobbi Watson, who was with Susan the night I met her outside the cinema eight years ago. \"But when I think about the drone attacks, which trouble me, I think he's making decisions on the basis of information that I couldn't possibly know.\"</p> <p>Many redirect their disappointment in politics in general,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\"> pointing to the Republican stonewalling in Congress</a>. \"I never thought things could become more divided, and there be more fighting,\" said Ann Trinkel, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/01/younge-america-return-roanoke\">who I met in Roanoke recently</a>. \"But oh my gosh it's just \u2026 gridlock. And I guess that's what sort of lessened the hopefulness for me, and made me a bit more cynical, is all the money.\" It is certainly true that in a system where seats are openly gerrymandered, 40% in the upper house can block almost anything, lobbyists are everywhere and you need vast sums of money to get elected there is a limit to how much <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/americans-deserve-better-choice-election\">progressive change one can really expect</a>. Susan's husband, Michael who backed Obama last time, isn't voting. He's had enough of all of them.</p> <p>Some are just in denial. One person said to me when I raised the escalation in Afghanistan: \"You don't know what's in his heart.\"</p> <p>\"True,\" I replied. \"Only his cardiologist can know that. But that knowledge would make little difference to the people of Afghanistan.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397516242\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879038034/obama-younge-america--010.jpg\" alt=\"obama younge america \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The enthusiasm of Obama supporters \u2013 so prevalent on election night in 2008 \u2013 has waned in the last four years.  Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each disappointment can be argued out or argued away, dismissed by loyalists, insisted upon by the disaffected, explained by circumstance or excused at will. In any case, every president has these. So long as they are not full on reversals \u2013 as when George Bush senior said: \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" and then put up taxes \u2013 then they are rarely fatal. Obama hasn't opened another Guantanamo Bay facility, and it is understood that presidents don't get everything done that they promise to do.</p> <p>But that does not mean they are not grounds for disappointment. Obama ran claiming he was going to change the way Washington operated, and there was much he could not control. But it was his choice to leave in place George W Bush's secretary of defence and to draft of Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary, Larry Summers, to guide his economic policy. With those appointments there's only so much 'change' one can reasonably expect. Moreover, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/guantanamo-bay-open-promises/story?id=16698768\">if someone who says</a>: \"I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that,\" and promises it'll be closed within a year and it's still open, then by any measure people are entitled to feel let down.</p> <p>But left there all of these particular disappointments would have remained just that \u2013 particular letdowns that disillusioned discrete groups of people. What morphed them into a broader narrative of disappointment was the one thing over was the key issue of the economy over which he had limited power \u2013 and gridlock in Congress.</p> <p>In September 2010 he was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBfCco9BOTA\">challenged at a town hall meeting</a> by a black woman, Velma Hart, who said: \"I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for, and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.\"</p> <p>With poverty rising, unemployment stubbornly high and wages still stagnant the economy was both a material problem in itself \u2013 people have been struggling to make ends meet \u2013 and became an emblem for a broader disaffection. The country was stalled. And whatever it was they were expecting from his presidency it wasn't this. They wanted more and, many believe, he promised more.</p> <h2>'It seems like there's no good way out'</h2> <p>Jodie Delamatre has no time for this. She is no stranger to disappointment. I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/03/uselections2004.usa2\">followed Jodie around on election day in 2004</a> as she knocked on doors to get out the vote. I saw her in the polling booth press her pin down hard to avoid through the punch card for Kerry to avoid any Florida-like shenanigans. \"I've got to make sure it counts,\" she said. \"I don't want to leave anything to chance.\" That night when the polls closed they thought they'd squeaked a victory in Ohio and therefore the nation. When I called her the next morning she was devastated.</p> <p>This time around she wished Obama had done more about the banks. But she thinks those who dwell on their disappointments are self-indulgent. \"People <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">ask what has he done and I think well what did you do</a>? You can't just have things given to you all the time. You have to go out and get them. And look at the things he has done. In four years he's introduced healthcare reform, stabilised the economy, stopped a war, killed Bin Laden, saved the auto industry \u2013 give me a break.\" When Obama was inaugurated <a href=\"http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=county:CN391530&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:U&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=summit+county+oh+unemployment\">unemployment in Summit County</a>, where Akron sits, was 8.8%; today it is 6.5%. In 2009 the poverty rate is 14.9; today it is 13.8%.</p> <p>It is true that if you ask most people what they thought would happen their hopes are as heartfelt as they are vague. \"I definitely think it's about me,\" says Susan. \"I hoped he would give us a vision of where we were going. Just one big idea. But it doesn't seem as though he has one. I did hope that he would be that person who would pull it off. Because otherwise it seems like there's no good way out.\"</p> <p>Obama's election forced a reckoning between what a large number of Americans wanted to happen and what was possible to achieve through the American polity as it stands. The hard truth is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/24/obama-never-room-for-radical-change\">with few exceptions</a> the most transformational advances in US political history have their origins either in the streets or the courts \u2013 not the ballot box.</p>",
  "<p>Last week saw a powerful investigation by Tim Whewell for Newsnight on the re-emergence of the use of bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) hotels for homeless families. A significant number of councils may be acting unlawfully by using B&amp;Bs except for short-term emergencies and in breach of public health standards. Whewell exposed scandalous conditions in Croydon, dangerous overcrowding, families virtually living on a bed in one room with little circulation space, wholly inadequate toilets, bathrooms and kitchens, fire hazards and infestation.</p> <p>Working closely with the most hard-pressed councils, the government managed to keep the use of B&amp;B under firm control for many years. Councils have now experienced both surging numbers of homeless families and shrinking supply of reasonably-priced temporary accommodation and permanent social housing. This leads to only one outcome: the use of worsening temporary accommodation.</p> <p>The numbers in B&amp;B have increased alarmingly over the past couple of years. But have the danger flags been raised? Newsnight's interviews revealed denial and buck-passing. The chief executive of Croydon claiming that properties were regularly inspected and the problem was under control exuded complacency.</p> <p>The new Liberal Democrat minister Don Foster should not have been allowed out on his own after such a short period in the job. Foster just tried to pass the buck, to shift the blame from government to councils and responded to every point by quoting figures about money given to local authorities to manage homelessness.</p> <p>Whewell's report gave me a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It was so reminiscent of the 1980s when more and more councils reached a tipping point. They couldn't keep up with growing numbers of families becoming homeless. It started with emergency use of B&amp;B for a few nights; soon it became frequent use of B&amp;B for a few months. It led to block long-term bookings of whole hotels, and areas such as Bayswater becoming small towns of homeless families. Health, schooling and other services were inundated. It slid slowly but inexorably out of control \u2013 and it took years to recover. It cost tens of thousands of families, and especially their children, dearly and it cost local taxpayers an absolute fortune. We are staring over the same precipice.</p> <p>In the 1980s I visited a lot of these B&amp;Bs, especially in Bayswater. Whewell's report showed nothing much has changed today. The tiny rooms, the hallways that become playspace, the overused bathrooms, queues to use kitchens, and the desperation and resignation on the faces of the families.</p> <p>This week David Cameron, Michael Gove and Eric Pickles told us about their commitment of giving children a good start in life. But the true impact of their policies can be found in the hotels of Croydon.</p> <p><em>Steve Hilditch co-edits </em><a href=\"http://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Red Brick blog</em></a><em> and chair of the London Labour Housing Group</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Following a summer of dramatic increases in international and UK food prices, the third spike since 2008, it is becoming clear the dynamics of the international food system are changing \u2013 and not for the better. With <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPOVERTY/Resources/336991-1311966520397/Food-Price-Watch-August-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">increases of 10% on international food markets</a>, and domestic staples up by as much as 113% in some countries, it is time to focus on what needs to happen next.</p> <p>Research by Save the Children, due to be published next week, will highlight that we are facing a \"new normal\" of high and volatile food prices. The stakes are high. The countries with the highest burden of undernutrition, responsible for as many as 2.6m child deaths a year, are the most exposed to food price spikes. They tend to be net importers of food, and have citizens who spend 30-60% of their income on food.</p> <p>When prices go up, poor people take their children out of school and prioritise foods that provide energy over nutrition. A relatively short spike can have long-term effects on the development and potential of children.</p> <p>In the face of these changes, the G20 established the agricultural markets information system (Amis) last year to monitor and respond to food price volatility. Last month, <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E8KHNPC20120917?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0\" title=\"\">France called for a meeting of Amis's rapid response forum</a>, a request swiftly rejected by the US as being unnecessary. This kind of complacency could be disastrous if it fails to curb panicked policy responses. In 2010, an export ban imposed by Russia sent international food prices spiralling, while having limited impact on calming price rises in the country.</p> <p>Russia has already <a href=\"http://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/wheat/russia-no-b-on-grain-expts_11-ar26136\" title=\"\">rejected reports</a> it would impose a grain export ban. Yet conversations in the corridors of agriculture ministries and trading floors suggest more subtle measures may be afoot, such as using government control of the national railway to slow exports. In 2010, the Kremlin denied export restrictions only three hours before <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/rr-impact-russias-grain-export-ban-280611-en.pdf\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin, then the prime minister, announced an export ban</a>.</p> <p>If the international community is serious about dealing with this problem, it needs to address the fundamentals. Investment in agriculture has been declining year on year in Africa. This pattern needs to change and will involve more investment from donors, and developing countries improving their ability to collect taxes \u2013 measures should be taken against companies undermining these efforts by dodging taxes.</p> <p>Scaling up resources is not enough. The governance of the international food system needs a step change. EU and US biofuel mandates, which demand that a proportion of the fuel they use comes from renewable sources, have been criticised. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), NGOs and, most recently, the chief executive of agriculture firm Cargill say food insecurity is being exacerbated by shifting massive tracts of land from food to fuel production. In the face of persistent food insecurity, the subsidies for this should be swiftly revised.</p> <p>Transparency and improved governance of large-scale land acquisition is also critical. Oxfam <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/04/land-deals-preventing-food-production\" title=\"\">reported last week</a> that huge areas of land are being leased or sold every six days, with nearly a third of Liberia swallowed up by land deals in just five years. Not all land deals are bad, of course, but without appropriate governance, these can undermine the food security of local communities in developing countries.</p> <p>Investing in food stocks is part of the long-term solution to volatility. Every food price spike since world war two has coincided with low stock levels. Yet this investment is expensive and would need to occur over a long period to avoid hoarding pushing up prices at a time when supplies are limited.</p> <p>Agriculture ministers are due to meet in Rome on 16 October, World Food Day. They must remember that although the politics may be difficult, the stakes are high for the world's poorest people. They must set out a road map to respond to this crisis and act urgently to address the drivers of volatility \u2013 not just respond when crises hit.</p>",
  "<p>From the diary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/malala-yousafzai-bullet-removed-taliban\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, dated 3 January 2009:</p> <blockquote> \"I AM AFRAID. <br>I had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taliban. I have had such dreams since the launch of the military operation in Swat.\" </blockquote> <p>This is an excerpt <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7834402.stm\" title=\"\">from Malala's first diary entry</a>, who was in seventh grade when she volunteered to write about the Talibanisation of the Swat valley for BBC Urdu. Her entries describe sneaking to school in her favourite pink dress because the school uniform would draw the militants' attention, only to be told her bright attire might do the same. Her diary ends as school closes \"indefinitely\" for winter. Pakistan's army then started a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/5278359/Pakistanis-urged-to-leave-Swat-valley-ahead-of-military-operation.html\" title=\"\">military operation against the Taliban</a>, ejecting them in late 2009, temporarily displacing about 2&#xa0;million local Swatis.</p> <p>The international media followed Malala's story. She has been nominated for several awards and uses public platforms to speak about things she feels passionately about: rebuilding Swat and focusing on education. She <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2012/07/11/gulmakai-the-future-of-pakistan/\" title=\"\">said at a conference</a> earlier this year that \"democracy is the best rule. This country needs new leaders. I want to study the law and I dream of a country in which education prevails and no one sleeps hungry.\"</p> <p>Perhaps such words keep her in Taliban crosshairs: they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/pakistan-girl-shot-activism-swat-taliban\" title=\"\">claimed responsibility for an assassination attempt</a> against the young activist yesterday. After complicated surgery, doctors say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/malala-yousafzai-bullet-removed-taliban?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">she should recover</a>, but the teenager has a lot to assess later.</p> <p>Will she continue to campaign for education and, furthermore, would she be able to? When unable to protect vulnerable citizens who get international attention, Pakistan's government usually offers a free ride abroad. It also speaks volumes about a geopolitical issue careering out of control for the militants, their advocates, and the Pakistan government when militants take it on themselves to attack a 14-year-old girl because she was seen to be \"anti-Taliban\" and \"secular\".</p> <p>Malala showed admirable, even rare, bravery by writing a public diary against the brutal Taliban. However, her demand \u2013 the freedom to study for all and to develop a country that focuses on education \u2013 isn't so unusual for women who live in patriarchal conservative societies such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa\" title=\"\">province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a>, or KP, where she resides.</p> <p>The people of KP often live segregated from the opposite sex, unless related by blood or marriage. Religion is a central thread in Pakistan, but conservatives and liberals equally follow their faith. It's not purely an adherence to religion that makes Malala's heartland rather conservative, but a historic tribal culture rooted in certain values. Such values should not be confused with the barbarianism of the Taliban. Women dress modestly in voluminous clothes, and tend to be less visible in the public eye than men, but by no means are the women meek nonentities \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people\" title=\"\">Pashtuns</a> are known to be fiery, proud folks. Malala herself was named by her father after a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malalai_Anaa\" title=\"\">national folk heroine</a> who fought alongside an Afghan general against British troops in 1880.</p> <p>People often see the covered head or shapeless attire of women and assume they are also voiceless, that the head patriarch must have stamped out their identity. But there is a distinction between terrorism-driven oppression and conservative values, which happily evolve and branch out if given that space. Malala's parents are an example. They respect regional norms, but want their little girl to learn, and become a participatory citizen.</p> <p>Being a female and an activist is hard in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\" title=\"\">Pakistan</a>. There are several layers that need to be pushed through to be heard, and there are few promises of safety in a society that's imploding and then torn asunder by foreign strikes. Pakistani society also suffers from the great divide between the fortunate who can be brazen and loud, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beenasarwar/status/256001195930447872\" title=\"\">tweeting about online petitions</a> from the safety of relatively cocooned environs, and those who grow up like Malala, even without coming under attack from militant terrorism. And within that vast spectrum reside several shades of Pakistani women, including those who fit in more with the <a href=\"http://womennewsnetwork.net/2012/10/08/code-pink-pakistan-delegation/\" title=\"\">Code Pinkers</a> than the Malalas.</p> <p>Being a female with conservative values, while being an activist, is even harder. It draws more ire from unhinged fanatics who assume covered heads mean bowed heads. But Malala doesn't want to play to some western-backed or Taliban-loved stereotype. She shows us that there are voices out there, in Pakistan, that need to be heard, if only to help the country find democracy that is for and from the people, all the people. This sad, small window will reveal if Pakistan can ever come together to keep these and more voices from being silenced, or if Malala, like many others, will just remain a fringe player.</p>",

Speaking after the announcement, another sources said that Merkel was \"a key factor in the decision to terminate the talks\", with her objections becoming clear only over the last 24 hours. Prior to that, both companies were expecting to seek an extension to a UK Takeover Panel deadline that expired at 5pm.</p> <p>However, as alluded to by the joint statement on Wednesday afternoon, the UK and French governments also harboured concerns about the transaction to the extent that every workable solution drew an objection from one of the three governments.</p> <p>France, which controlled 15% of EADS, was unhappy with German demands for the business to have its headquarters in Munich, while Germany was concerned that France would have a bigger shareholding in the new business than the 9% stake that it was seeking. The UK, in turn, refused to allow German and French political representatives to sit on the BAE board, as would have been likely under the dual-listed structure envisaged by both companies.</p> <p>BAE and EADS said they had made significant progress in thrashing out the shape of their merged business, including the management structure, the dividend policy and cost savings.</p> <p>\"BAE Systems and EADS believe that the merger was based on sound industrial logic,\" the companies said, having argued over the last month that the deal would protect BAE from the troubled UK defence market while giving EADS access to the US military sector.</p> <p>\"It represented a unique opportunity to create a combination from two strong and successful companies greater than the sum of the parts. The merger would have produced a combined business that would have been a technology leader and a greater force for competition and growth across both the commercial aerospace and defence sectors and which would have delivered tangible benefits to all stakeholders.\"</p> <p>Ian King, the BAE chief executive, said he was \"obviously disappointed\" that an agreement could not be reached but defended BAE's prospects, which will now be the subject of intense political and City debate.</p> <p>\"We believe the merger presented a unique opportunity for BAE Systems and EADS to combine two world class and complementary businesses to create a world leading aerospace, defence and security group,\" he said. \"However, our business remains strong and financially robust. We continue to see opportunities across our platforms and services offerings and in the various international markets in which we operate. We remain committed to delivering total shareholder value and look to the future with confidence.\"</p> <p>The chief executive designate of the merged company, EADS boss Tom Enders, said: \"It is, of course, a pity we didn't succeed but I'm glad we tried. I'm sure there will be other challenges we'll tackle together in the future.\"</p> <p>Analysts said the smaller of the two businesses, BAE, now faced serious questions over its future. \"We think the pressure will be on BAE more than EADS to come up with a plan B,\" said Guy Anderson, senior principal analyst at IHS Jane's.</p> <p>\"I am not convinced that investors will put up with business as usual. BAE is not in a bad position, it is profitable with 8% profit margins, but the fact that they leapt into this merger has opened Pandora's box. It shows that they feel they are stronger with another company than not.\"</p> <p>The UK's largest trade union, Unite, said a merger would have \"protected the UK's long-term interests\" if it had been accompanied by a jobs guarantee for British employees. Ian Waddell, a Unite official, said the UK government could secure such a guarantee in future mergers or takeovers by taking an equity stake in the company. Although the British government has a \"golden share\" in the business, which can block a foreign takeover, it does not control a significant block of shares similar to France's stake in EADS.</p> <p>Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston, who organised a petition against the deal signed by 45 MPs, said the deal should never have been promoted due to the threat of French and German political interference.</p> <p>Wallace said Wednesday's developments put the future of King and his board colleagues at risk.</p> <p>\"The BAE board should now reflect long and hard at what their strategic error could mean for the company's future. If they have put at risk my constituents' jobs and fatally wounded the UK's jewel in the manufacturing crown, then they should consider their position.</p> <p>\"BAE and its workers is a world leader in aerospace it has a great future it does not deserve, through inconsistent and unrealistic strategy to be put at risk by such leadership.\"</p>",
  "<p>Greece, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania are the worst European Union countries at delivering justice through criminal trials, according to an independent survey of the union's courts.</p> <p>States on the eastern fringes of the union emerge as serial offenders in a comparative study of breaches of individuals' right to liberty and a fair trial recorded by the European court of human rights (ECHR).</p> <p>Delays in bringing cases to trial were the most common reason for critical judgments. In some EU countries pre-trial detention can last for up to four years; others have no legal maximum.</p> <p>The figures, collected by the London-based organisation Fair Trials International and the international law firm Clifford Chance, cover a five-year period between 2007 and this summer.</p> <p>The problems appear to be getting worse. There were 37 violations of the right to a fair criminal trial in EU states in 2007, and 75 in 2011 \u2013 an increase of more than 100%.</p> <p>Greece had the highest number of violations \u2013 108 \u2013 for breaching both articles over the five-year period. Most relate to chronic delays in bringing cases to trial. Interpreters are not always available and concerns have been raised about judicial corruption in Greece, the study, <a href=\"http://www.fairtrials.net/publications/policy-and-campaigns/\" title=\"\">Defence Rights in the EU</a>, warns.</p> <p>Bulgaria had 92 violations recorded by the ECHR, most of them also due to inordinate delays. Those detained are often not given sufficient access to lawyers or their family, the report finds.</p> <p>Poland, with 67 breaches, fell foul of the Strasbourg court's requirement that there should be legal advice for defendants and because of lengthy legal postponements. Too many people are routinely detained in custody and denied access to court files during investigations, the study adds.</p> <p>Romania, with 49 violations, was criticised for failing to allow detainees to challenge the legality of their detention, be presumed innocent until found guilty and question witnesses giving evidence against them.</p> <p>The UK figures of 12 violations over the five years, with fewer recorded breaches than Italy and France, is relatively low. That figure will confound eurosceptics who claim that the Strasbourg court is unreasonably critical of British justice. Conversely, it will bolster the UK government's argument that the court should concentrate on those countries whose legal systems consistently cause the most problems.</p> <p>Adjusted for population size, the United Kingdom in 2011 had one of the best records in adhering to acceptable standards set out in article 5 (the right to liberty) and article 6 (the right to a fair trial) of the European convention on human rights. Tiny Malta and Latvia stand as the worst two offenders.</p> <p>The pattern of legal failures roughly reflects the economics of the continent, with poorer states least able to deliver fair and timely justice. <a href=\"http://www.fairtrials.net/justice-in-europe/\" title=\"\">Fair Trials International has used the information to produce a map which assesses each EU state in terms of its criminal law difficulties.</a></p> <p>Jago Russell, chief executive of the charity, said: \"Suspects' rights are being violated in police stations, courtrooms and prisons across Europe. In a European Union founded on the rule of law and respect for basic human rights, these abuses cannot be allowed to continue.</p> <p>\"The EU has a crucial role to play in raising standards of justice in Europe, but if it fails to act now, citizens' faith in EU laws like the European arrest warrant will be undermined.\"</p> <p>Fair Trials International is calling for a common EU standard on how long anyone can be remanded in custody before being brought before a court.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. The police.</strong> With Andrew Mitchell's alleged \"pleb\" rant at Downing Street police officers still rather too fresh in everyone's minds, and police reforms, budget cuts and pay cuts exercising officers up and down the country, maybe it was no surprise that David Cameron steered clear of mentioning this particular group of public servants. A poster outside the conference centre said: \"Say hello to Dave, wave goodbye to your police service.\"</p> <p><strong>2. An EU referendum.</strong> There was no mention either of a referendum on Europe, which had been clearly signalled by the prime minister in a round of interviews this week. But Cameron knows it's not just about holding a vote, but what question you are actually asking.</p> <p><strong>3. The Lib Dems.</strong> Cameron focused on lauding the Conservative brand, and panning the Labour one, and left the Liberal Democrats out altogether. While Cameron name-checked Labour several times, and Ed Miliband in person, there was not a peep about his coalition partners or their leader, Nick Clegg.</p> <p><strong>4. Gay marriage.</strong> David Cameron has previously tried to sell gay marriage as consistent with Tory values ie commitment, but it's not going down well with many grassroots activists who aired their dissent at conference fringes on the issue. So Cameron left it out, and left it to the equalities minister, Maria Miller, to speak up for gay marriage in a speech earlier in the day.</p> <p><strong>5. The Health Act.</strong> Cameron's claim to be \"the party of the NHS\" was made without a single mention of the Tory-inspired shakeup of the NHS courtesy of recent legislation pushed through by the former health secretary Andrew Lansley, who has been shipped out of health to make way for Jeremy Hunt.</p>",
  "<p>In the biggest car recall since 1996, Toyota is calling back 7.4m vehicles worldwide after discovering faulty window switches in 12 models. In the UK, 138,000 cars are affected.</p> <p>The Japanese carmaker stressed that there have not been any accidents or injuries \u2013 the problem is the electric window switch which could feel uneven or notchy and could over time stick. There has been one reported case in the UK. Toyota said various simulation tests had shown there was no risk of fire.</p> <p>It is the biggest car recall since Ford was forced to call back 8m vehicles in 1996 to replace defective igntion switches that could cause engine fires.</p> <p>\"Recalls in the automotive sector are not rare events, but the size and scale of this particular recall is unusual,\" said Richard Matthews, head of product liability at international law firm Eversheds. \"Toyota faced heavy public scrutiny for the way it handled recalls in 2009-10, culminating in a record fine of $16.4m (\u00a310.2bn) from the US transportation department. Toyota's approach this time around is perhaps indicative of an increasingly 'belt and braces' approach to managing risk.\"</p> <p>Toyota already recalled more than 10m vehicles between 2009 and 2011 over various problems, and the latest recall will further damage its reputation. It is now calling back 1.39m vehicles in Europe, 2.47m in the US and 1.4m in China, as well as 459,000 in Japan, 650,000 in Australia and Asia and 490,000 vehicles in the Near and Middle East.</p> <p>The range of Toyota cars affected worldwide include some models of the Yaris, Vios, Corolla, Matrix, Auris, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia, xB and xD made between 2005 and 2010.</p> <p>In Britain, only three models are affected \u2013 the RAV4, Yaris and Auris. Toyota said the window switches take about an hour to fix. All affected owners will be contacted by Toyota GB within the next six weeks and asked to bring their car to the nearest Toyota centre. The dealer will check the window switch and will apply a special lubricant if it is operating properly, or replace it if not.</p> <p>The move comes a day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/09/japanese-car-sales-china-islands-dispute\" title=\"\">Toyota reported a near-50% slump in sales in China</a> in September, where Japanese car brands have suffered because of anti-Japanese sentiment in the wake of a Sino-Japanese territorial dispute.</p> <p>Despite this, Matthews noted that Toyota's brand had proved remarkably resilient: in August it announced a quarterly profit of \u00a5290bn (\u00a32.3bn), the highest in four years, and the business still claims the top spot for global sales, with 4.87m units sold in the first half of 2012.</p>",

  "<h2>Tim Montogomerie: Fighting Labour for the moral high ground</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397506876\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/18/1313679712567/Tim-Montgomerie-003.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Montgomerie\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Montgomerie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We defeated the Nazis, invented the computer, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for 1000 years. That was at the heart of David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/10/david-cameron-speech-conservative-conference-live-blog\" title=\"\">closing pitch at the Tory conference</a>. His clear message was that Britain could do anything if it was determined enough. In an Olympic year in which our athletes delivered golden glory and the whole country delivered both organisational efficiency and magical settings it was a believable message.</p> <p>Cameron didn't stop with his optimism, however. People expect Tory governments to be bold and energetic. People expect the party of Margaret Thatcher to be in favour of aspiration and enterprise. What they also want from modern government is a sense of compassion and decency. In was in this respect that Cameron succeeded. He reasserted his commitment to the NHS, disabled people, the aid budget and gay rights. He might not have persuaded huge numbers yet but he signalled his determination to stay true to compassionate conservatism. He'll go into the next election fighting Labour for the moral high ground; arguing that his vision of a good society \u2013 built around better schools, stronger families and job creation \u2013 is superior to Labour's unthinking reliance on a bigger and bigger state.</p> <p>Ed Miliband did nothing last week to address Labour's biggest weakness \u2013 the sense that his party hasn't learned any lessons from its mistakes. Miliband did nothing to convince people that another Labour government wouldn't plunge the economy back into debt. Cameron showed today that he does get it. He understands that he must convince the British people that the Conservative party is as compassionate as it is tough. He hasn't succeeded in that task yet but at least, unlike Miliband, he's started to face up to his challenge.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Montgomerie edits Conservativehome.com</p> <h2>Stewart Wood: To whom does 'sink-or-swim' refer?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397506877\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/9/1326133501065/Stewart-Wood-003.jpg\" alt=\"Stewart Wood\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stewart Wood Photograph: Stewart Wood</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stewart Wood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tories have spent their conference in response mode to Ed Miliband's \"one nation\" speech last week. David Cameron's speech today took this defensiveness to new heights. But it also revealed the limits of his ability to meet both the challenge Ed laid down, and the public's demand for change.</p> <p>I was struck by Cameron's central metaphor of Britain facing a \"sink or swim\" moment. All parties must recognise the tough choices the economic moment requires. The first demand of a government in tough times is an economic strategy that works. But as growth continues to stagnate and debt rises, we all know that Cameron's plan is not working. Waving the spectre of decline in the face of the British public does not an economic strategy make, and does not excuse their refusal to talk about growth and jobs all week.</p> <p>My strong suspicion remains that \"sink or swim\" is not just Cameron's motto for how Britain competes internationally, but also for the kind of economy and society that he wants to see at home in Britain. His challenge was to prove that his vision for the country is one that can extend to everyone rather than simply holding promise for the few. Today's speech failed that test, just as his mission to modernise the party has gone into reverse since he was elected prime minister.</p> <p>It has been a Tory conference dominated by the dictates of party management, with a series of scattergun announcements designed to keep different parts of the Tory fold happy. What today's speech confirmed was that Cameron is either unwilling or incapable of being a one-nation prime minister, and of delivering the kind of radical change that Britain needs.</p> <p>\u2022 Stewart Wood is an adviser to Ed Miliband in the leader's office</p> <h2>Ian Birrell: Modern conservatism that unites the party's left and right</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397506878\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/13/1329122986331/Ian-Birrell---new-003.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Birrell - new\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Birrell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Birrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Cameron will never be an orator whose barnstorming speaking rouses a hall to its feet. He strikes out the flashier phrases, the more flowery paragraphs proposed by his speechwriters, as not being true to his character. But this year's conference speech, for all its earnest delivery, was his best since he saw off the Gordon Brown election attempt in 2007. Not just because it contained a handful of memorable zingers \u2013 the best of which was the return volley to Ed Miliband, saying Labour was \"the party of one notion \u2013 borrowing\". Not just for the genuinely moving mention of what the Paralympics meant to him as the father of a child with disabilities. And not just for the skillful and self-deprecating way in which he deflected issues such as his background and his school.</p> <p>No, it worked because Cameron clearly set out his vision of compassionate Conservatism. For too long, this narrative has been lying almost dormant amid the focus on the deficit. It was explained not just with the simplistic lines that his party was one that welcomed anyone whether they were black or white, gay or straight. Instead, there was a clear argument that there has to be tough action to reform the welfare state so it works for those most in need. And that in doing so, tackling the \"toxic culture of low ambition that has held our country back\", Britain would be better placed to fight the challenges of fast-rising nations such as Indonesia and Nigeria as well as the likes of China.</p> <p>In the best modernising tradition, there was little mention of Europe and no mention of conference crowd-pleasers such as crime and immigration. Instead, there was a definition of modern conservatism that unites the left and right of the party while challenging the shallow one-nation rhetoric of his rivals. As he drives back to Downing Street, Cameron can reflect on a job well done at the end of a conference in which his party rediscovered its confidence after an abysmal six months. Then comes the harder bit of ensuring all his government's actions match these fine words, as reforms such as those to disability benefits start to bite.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Birrell is a former speechwriter for David Cameron</p> <h2>Frances O'Grady: His claims about job creation don't stack up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397506879\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/25/1343230313175/FrancesOGrady.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O'Grady\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was an empty speech from a prime minister unwilling to accept that his economic policies are failing to deliver the jobs and growth that hard-pressed families desperately need. The speech was light on solutions. And with the UK still in a double-dip recession, living standards continuing to fall and record numbers still out of work the UK needs more than half-baked aspirations.</p> <p>There were some things the prime minister was right about. I agree that our economy desperately needs investment. It's a shame that his government has cut capital spending by 50%.</p> <p>He's also right about needing to get the deficit down. What the prime minister failed to mention was that his austerity strategy is causing borrowing to rise, with the deficit now back to around where it was in 2010.</p> <p>Everyone agrees we need more good and sustainable jobs. But his claim to have created a million private sector jobs doesn't stack up. Full-time employee jobs are only up 130,000. Meanwhile we have an under-employment crisis \u2013 over 3 million people needing more hours to make ends meet and 2.5 million people out of work altogether.</p> <p>The prime minister has a cheek to claim that cutting people's benefits is a good way to force them into work when there aren't enough jobs for them to do. And proposing cuts in housing benefit for young families isn't compassionate \u2013 it's inhumane.</p> <p>This wasn't a speech with new thinking on the big challenges for the future. It was more of the same old ideas that didn't work the first time round.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances O'Grady is general secretary designate of the TUC</p>",

I was in Brighton performing tracks from the album for the first time. I was so scared I didn't put on a good show; the audience focused on how nervous I was rather than the performance.

I would much rather people listened to the album and made up their own mind rather than being told what it is. I think my music is aimed at a slightly older and more sophisticated palette.

  "<p>On Tuesday the comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/09/justin-lee-collins-guilty-harassing\" title=\"\">Justin Lee Collins was sentenced to 140 hours of community service</a> for subjecting his ex-girlfriend to a prolonged campaign of harassment, causing fear of violence. I am, of course, pleased that Collins was found guilty of harassing Anna Larke but 140 hours of community service and an order to pay \u00a33,500 is a small penalty to pay for the fear she has experienced.</p> <p>As chief executive of the national domestic violence charity <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Refuge</a>, I have worked with victims of domestic violence for over 30 years. Domestic violence comes in multiple, ugly forms and can involve extreme physical brutality \u2013 black eyes, broken bones, bruises. Such physical abuse can be devastating \u2013 even fatal. Every single week <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=two%20women%20a%20week%20killed%20by&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Frefuge.org.uk%2Fcms_content_refuge%2Fattachments%2FRefuge%2520Early%2520Warning%2520Signs%2520Advert%2520embaroged%2520until%25205%2520August.pdf&amp;ei=JmF1UNaJA43D0AWDjoCQAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEmxUdnhHtC-sjJsztZ0mrE6deZw&amp;sig2=CzKUjEGsP-C6_-q8P-1SrQ\" title=\"\">two women are killed by current or former partners</a> in England and Wales.</p> <p>But domestic violence is also non-physical. It can be verbal, emotional, psychological and financial. The government recently announced its plans to amend its definition of domestic violence by including the phrase \"coercive control\" to reflect this. Let me be clear: domestic violence involves the repeated, habitual and random use of intimidation, whether by physical or verbal aggression, to force a woman to submit to her partner's demands. Domestic violence is systematic, purposeful and patterned behaviour designed to gain control of a woman.</p> <p>Most women I meet through my work tell me that the effects of emotional and psychological abuse are just as \u2013 if not more \u2013 damaging than slaps and punches. The scars left are deeper, and take longer to heal. And because this kind of abuse is largely invisible, victims are often disbelieved when they find the courage to disclose it. All too often, society turns a blind eye. People think that if it doesn't result in a swollen eye or a broken arm, it's not a \"real\" crime. But we should never underestimate the impact of psychological and emotional abuse.</p> <p>Anna Larke experienced exactly this kind of behaviour at the hands of Justin Lee Collins. She was subjected to vicious tirades of verbal abuse. She was ordered to close down her email account and Facebook page. She was forced to write down details of her previous sexual encounters. She was controlled, monitored, manipulated. Her freedom was curtailed. She lived in fear.</p> <p>Every single day Refuge supports hundreds of women who have shared Anna Larke's horrors. And we know that what starts as verbal and emotional abuse usually escalates into worse. Research has consistently shown that excessive jealousy, extreme controlling behaviour, stalking and harassment are often predictors of serious injury or homicide. They are not about a man \"losing his temper\" or \"flipping out\". They are part of a pattern of abusive intent which can \u2013 and does \u2013 end in tragedy.</p> <p>The severity of Collins's crime was not reflected in his sentence. Sadly, this is not unusual. It speaks volumes about the poor quality of training given to our judiciary system on the complex risks and dynamics of abuse.</p> <p>We need to ensure that all those charged with a duty to protect vulnerable women and girls \u2013 whether they be police officers, judges, teachers or doctors \u2013 know how to spot the signs of abuse and respond appropriately to both victims and abusers.</p> <p>Into the future, we need to see more men like Justin Lee Collins being held to account. Above all, we need to congratulate Anna Larke for taking her tormentor to court \u2013 it was a brave and positive step. I hope that her actions will encourage other brave women to come forward. Arresting and prosecuting perpetrators sends a strong public message that such abuse is unacceptable, criminal behaviour, and will not be tolerated.</p>",
  "<p>Things must be getting serious in the Conservative Party's PR pod. As the Labour leader steals the \"one nation\" Toryism of Benjamin Disraeli the architects of this photograph have made their own daring leap in the dark to pose David Cameron as Bob Dylan on the cover of his radical 1963 record The Freewheelin' David Cameron, sorry, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.</p> <p>At first glance this soft-lit urban romantic scene, with the Camerons on their way to celebrate his birthday at the Diwan Balti restaurant in Birmingham, may seem simply Athena-posterish or perhaps a tender moment from a Woody Allen film, but the imagery is far more precisely derivative. The briefest comparison reveals that the Camerons have been posed to ape the cover of Dylan's classic album The Freewheelin' ...</p> <p>Dave is Bob, walking with his head inclined down towards his girl, just as on the record cover. Samantha Cameron snuggles close to her guy just like Suze Rotolo did back in 1963.</p> <p>Dylan and Rotolo were photographed on a rugged New York street, between fire escapes and lines of cars, in an image at once gritty and passionate. What a great look to relaunch compassionate Dave! In their portrait, the Camerons are seen on the mean streets of Birmingham (I am imagining it through Tory PR eyes) with a red car to his left, while someone is on the phone in the background. The rich light catches car metal, pavement, a sign.</p> <p>It's all very cinematic but then so was the Dylan album art it imitates. Dylan's record cover portrays him and his girlfriend as romantics in a hard, tough world. The songs within address that world with anger, compassion and love: The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan includes the anti-war ballad Masters of War, the apocalyptic warning A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall and the love song Corinna, Corinna.</p> <p>So as Labour summons one nation this picture subliminally claims that David Cameron is a hard-edged romantic with the soul of a folk singer, a poet raging at injustice. Who knew? To misquote the most famous song on that legendary record, how many cuts must a nation take before they announce Plan B? The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind.</p>",

She quickly ordered an inquiry into the death of Chasowa.</p> <p>While no details of the culprits were released, Banda said: \"We can assure you that anyone responsible for the death of Robert Chasowa will face the full wrath of the law. We will leave nothing undone to ensure that justice is not only done but also seen to be done.</p> <p>\"Let the blood of Robert Chasowa be a lesson to all, that taking human life is not a light issue.\"</p> <p>Moses Kunkuyu, the information minister, told Malawi's Nyasa Times: \"The outcome of the Robert Chasowa inquiry, and the confirmation, as many suspected, that Robert Chasowa was brutally murdered by the Bingu wa Mutharika regime, is <a href=\"http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2012/10/10/malawi-police-puts-chasowa-murder-suspects-under-surveillance-arrests-looming/\" title=\"\">a fresh reminder of the dark and dangerous days that the Malawi nation lived through</a> just five months ago.\"</p> <p>Chasowa, an engineering student, was president of a youth rights group at the polytechnic in Blantyre. His purported suicide note read: \"Something terrible is about to happen to me. Am sorry I never explained anything when I came last time\u2026 am sorry for the pain am about to cause. Have taken my life. Burn me up and give the ashes to Vivian.\"</p> <p>Chasowa's father, Austin, told the Guardian earlier this year: \"I've seen the postmortem report. It is not suicide. The truth is he was killed by politicians.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the US supreme court once again wrestles with affirmative action this week, <a href=\"http://www.acri.org/ward_bio.html\">Ward Connerly</a> is doubtlessly a happy man. I am sure the former UC Regent, who launched his nationwide assault on affirmative action from California, will join others in their effort to permanently end the use of race in college admissions at the University of Texas and beyond. It's a misguided effort, because the university's policy is constitutional. What's more, it's working.</p> <p>The facts in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas\">Texas case</a> are these: Abigail Fisher filed suit in 2008 claiming that she was denied undergraduate admission to the University of Texas because she was white. She lost in the lower courts but the justices agreed to hear her case this term.</p> <p>Fisher contends that the University of Texas treated her unfairly. She believes that race was the main reason she was rejected, and that race has no place in university admissions.</p> <p>The facts tell a different story. The university makes only limited use of race in its admission decisions. Most undergraduates are admitted through a state law that guarantees the top 10% of state high school graduates entrance to a state university. Fisher did not qualify. Texas admits its remaining students through a review process that considers race among a number of other factors like socioeconomic background and leadership potential. Race is not a dominant factor in admissions. Instead, Texas uses a holistic process in which applicants of any race can benefit. One's race is not the sum of their file; it's only a part of it. </p> <p>This use of race complies with the court's rulings. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger\">landmark Grutter decision</a> gives universities the freedom to consider race as one factor for admission in order to promote diversity and recruit under-represented minorities. With a rapidly growing minority population and a globalizing economy, the university has a legitimate interest to fulfil: recruiting a highly-qualified and representative student body and to prepare all of their students for a global workforce.</p> <p>Texas' approach to admissions stands in stark contrast to other state universities across the nation. Take my home state, California. After the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, which ended affirmative action, the number of African Americans and Latinos admitted declined significantly. Nowhere was the effect more strongly felt than at Berkeley. In 1995, UC Berkeley's entering class was 7.3% black, but by 1998, that number dropped by more than half, to 3.2%. By 2011, that percentage had only slightly risen to 3.9%. The state's prohibition on considering race in admissions left an indelible mark, as the <a href=\"http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28178\">UC's Fisher amicus brief</a> confirms. In an increasingly polyglot nation, what's left of our commitment to diversity?</p> <p>Opponents argue that considering race in admissions is no longer necessary. Yet, even though Barack Obama now lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the evidence regularly shows large and pervasive racial disparities in important aspects of contemporary American life. These include access to quality schools, employment, obesity rates, incarceration levels, and poverty. A <a href=\"http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/news/press-releases/crp-press-releases-2012/civil-rights-project-reports-deepening-segregation-and-challenges-educators-and-political-leaders-to-develop-positive-policies\">UCLA report released last month</a> found that school segregation is especially pronounced and that it has increased in recent years; what's more, black and Latino kids are much more likely to attend poorer schools.</p> <p>Such inequities have only grown since the onset of the great recession. Without policies that consider race, similar to Texas' approach, public university students will be less likely to enjoy the benefits of a truly diverse student body. </p> <p>Opponents believe that race-based admissions stigmatize minority students. Wrong: the research shows that feelings of inferiority were <em>lower</em> among minorities in schools with race-conscious admissions than those that prohibited affirmative action. Moreover, minorities attending elite colleges graduate at much higher rates than those who went to less selective institutions.</p> <p>Ultimately, the high court will have the final say on Texas' admissions policy. Regardless of the outcome, then, we need to think constructively about how to strengthen our public universities and prepare our next generation. The demographics of the nation are changing. Minorities will comprise over half the population in 30 years. </p> <p>Instead of employing diversity tactics that don't work, let's reconsider race in admissions as Texas has done. It not only secures diversity and furthers our global competitiveness, but also gives all Americans a fairer shot at success. There is nothing more important than that.<br>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>Above is a picture of Dale Abbey monastery in England. Or at least all that's left of it. Monasteries were big business in the 15th century, at least until Henry VIII got hold of them. The monastery's monks worked for the pope, and the Catholic church was all that there was.</p> <p>Under the leadership of the pope in Rome was the repository and source of all science, teaching, commerce, religion, politics, money, writing, ideas, publishing and just about everything else.</p> <p>You can think of the 15th century church as a kind of combination of the power and learning now held in the big multinationals, institutions and others: Apple, Exxon, Harvard, the Pentagon, Microsoft, NASA and Prada all rolled into one.</p> <p>And it looked like it was going to be that way forever. After all, who could take it down? Who could threaten such an institution? Threaten Apple and they'll take you to court, threaten the Vatican and they could excommunicate you, which might mean an eternity burning in hell \u2013 arguably worse than years of legal bills.</p> <p>Prior to Henry's time, books were extremely expensive things to publish and the cost of buying a single book in those days was about $45,000 (\u00a328,000) in today's money (for this bit of information I am grateful to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR\" title=\"\">NPR</a> and to the federal funding, which still exists... at least so far).</p> <p>The reason books suddenly got so cheap was that Gutenberg's printing press made it possible for anyone with an idea to publish and distribute their ideas at almost no cost. That was a real revolution. One of the people who cottoned on to the Gutenberg thing (an early adapter) was Martin Luther, father of the Lutheran church.</p> <p>That was 500 years ago. Now, it is happening again. This time through the web. Information is now much more readily available to everyone and anyone, and for free. On top of that, anyone can publish any idea they have (or TV show they think would be cool) and distribute it worldwide... for free.</p> <p>Once a single book cost $45,000; today it costs $40.00. That's a pretty steep price reduction. Now, let's apply that maths to the cost of producing a TV show. </p> <p>Once it was thought that it cost $250,000 or so to make a half-hour show for cable. But at that technology-driven rate of change it should now only cost $223. So break out your iPhone, start shooting, cut on FCPX or iMovie and I think we are about there.</p> <p><em>Michael Rosenblum is president and chief executive at </em><a href=\"http://www.rosenblumtv.com/\" title=\"\"><em>RosenblumTV</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

Perhaps it needs more celebrities. If ever there was a time to take stock, reflect and challenge, it is arguably right now. In times of extraordinary economic hardship, not only are services threatened, the prevalence of mental illness increases. The stresses of job loss, debt, family breakdown and a multitude of other misfortunes swell the ranks of people in need of help.

  "<p>A Republican congressman at the forefront of hearings into the killing of the US ambassador to Libya has attempted to directly tie the White House to security decisions that may have contributed to the disaster.</p> <p>Jason Chaffetz has alleged that there was a \"co-ordinated effort\" between the White House and the state department to scale down security at US diplomatic missions in Libya in the months before a militia attacked the American consulate in Benghazi on September 11, killing the ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other officials.</p> <p>Chaffetz's allegation comes ahead of a hearing by the House of Representatives oversight committee on Wednesday into whether the state department failed to heed warnings from Stevens and its own security personnel of the scale of the threat.</p> <p>US state department officials on Tuesday<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/chris-stevens-libya-consulate-attack\"> gave their most detailed description yet of the events in Benghazi</a>, and backed away from earlier assertions that the incident was triggered by protests against an anti-Islam video.</p> <p>They described frantic and prolonged efforts to rescue the ambassador, Chris Stevens, from a smoke-filled \"safe haven\" inside the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi where he apparently died of asphyxiation.</p> <p>The officials said there was nothing unusual happening near the Benghazi mission before the assault. Earlier accounts by White House and state department officials, including Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, suggested that the attacks were triggered by protests over a video made in California that insulted the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>Last week, Chaffetz, chairman of a subcommittee on national security, and congressman Darrell Issa, chairman of the oversight committee, wrote to Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/republicans-obama-chris-stevens-libya\">accusing the administration of incompetence and covering up the true nature</a> of what they say was a well-planned terrorist assault with links to al-Qaida.</p> <p>Now, in an attempt to pin ultimate responsibility on Barack Obama, Chaffetz says those cuts were at the behest of the White House.</p> <p>\"It seems to be a coordinated effort between the White House and the state department, from Secretary Clinton to President Obama's White House,\" Chaffetz told Fox News. \"There was a very conscious decision made. My personal opinion is that they wanted the appearance of normalisation there in Libya, and [that] putting up barbed wire on our facility would lead to the wrong impression. Something that this administration didn't want to have moving forward.\"</p> <p>However, Chaffetz admitted he had no evidence for his assertion.</p> <p>Chaffetz and Issa are also vulnerable to accusations of hypocrisy after it was revealed that both congressmen voted to cut the state department's diplomatic security budget after Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2010. Republicans have shaved nearly $800m off state department spending on worldwide security over the past two years including $376m cut from embassy protection this year alone.</p> <p>Among those called to testify before the oversight committee is the former head of US security in Libya, lieutenant colonel Andy Wood. He told CBS news that American officials, including himself and Stevens, made repeated calls for more security personnel in the months prior to the attack but the state department cut back instead.</p> <p>\"We tried to illustrate \u2026 to show them how dangerous and how volatile and just unpredictable that whole environment was over there. So to decrease security in the face of that really is \u2026 it's just unbelievable,\" Wood said.</p> <p>He told CBS that when he was told that his 16-member team and a separate state department elite force of six were being withdrawn from Libya in August he felt \"like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers. There was concern amongst the entire embassy staff\".</p> <p>\"They asked if we were safe,\" he said. \"They asked \u2026 what was going to happen, and I could only answer that what we were being told is that they're working on it \u2013 they'll get us more (security personnel), but I never saw that.\"</p> <p>The state department denies Wood's claim, saying there was no reduction in security personnel in the weeks before the attack in Benghazi. It said that when Wood's unit was withdrawn it was replaced bother others and that the number of security personnel in Libya remained constant.</p> <p>The state department also said Wood was based in Tripoli and had no knowledge of the situation in Benghazi, 400 miles away.</p> <p>The US under-secretary of state for management, Patrick Kennedy, will be the highest state department official to testify.</p>",
  "<p>The ground shook around Jewel and he crashed into the frame of the metal box. He cartwheeled like a seasoned gymnast just as the crane came crashing down, cutting through the top of the control cabin.</p> <p>It was snowing heavily and the ice froze Jewel's unprotected head. The whole mine had split apart from the explosion. Half of it had crumbled like dissolving salt. The rest was cracked and uneven. Most of it tilted down into the giant cavern that had once been the mining pit. The red lights blinked on as the shriek of the emergency alert cut through the cold air.</p> <p>Very slowly, a giant figure was rising out of the pit, as if making use of his limbs for the very first time, like a baby. Jewel barely glanced at the miners, rushing about in fear. He thought of the operation that had been assigned to him five days ago, and how it had come to this.<br><strong><br>7 Days Ago:</strong></p> <p>Doomus's heels made sharp clicking noises as he walked on the blood-dyed marble. It was made of the hardest skulls, as had been said by the owner of 'HELL HALLS Inc.' He regretted the gift he had presented to his father for his 4.55 billionth birthday.</p> <p>He crossed a dark courtyard adorned with beautiful blood-bloomed roses. The sky was blazing red. Crows and vultures looked down from their perches on the dead trees. He opened a shadow door with a shadow key and cautiously tip- toed into his father's library.</p> <p>His father was quite famous in the world of humans for all the wrong reasons. He was the devil. He was known by many names but 'Devil' was his original identity. A strong palm on his shoulder suddenly pulled Doomus back. He whirled around to find his father staring at him with his dark, deep red eyes. He was a muscular hell-man. He had muscles the size of femurs, as hard as diamond. He wore a suit with his long, trident shaped tail jutting out, which he used on his enemies. He had the horns of a goat, not of a bull.</p> <p>He stared at Doomus, disappointed by what he saw. Doomus had no muscles, but was thin and weak. He didn't have horns and had weak eyesight. He steered Doomus clear off the wall and dragged him (unknowingly dragged) into a chair.</p> <p> \"Doomus. I need your help. You are smart. You can open the core of the earth with your sorcery.\"</p> <p>Doomus replied,\" I will try father.\" </p> <p>The core contained a mysterious trophy. This trophy could help them take over the world!</p> <p><strong>5 Days Ago:</strong></p> <p>Jewel knew that he should not have accepted the assignment. But D.T stood in front of him, staring past his head, looking at an unknown destination. Jewel knew he was calculating risks, going over the plan, looking for loopholes.</p> <p>The plan was this:</p> <p>There had been illegal mining taking place in Russia. The miners were causing a major threat to the Russian government. Jewel was supposed to go and find a way to stop the mining. This sounded ridiculous, but nothing was ridiculous in front of D.T's eyes. Especially since the miners were carrying guns, grenades and Flash Grenades. They must have had something to hide.</p> <p>Jewel was sucked back into reality when his helping hand, a Siberian husky called Gem nudged him with his snout. Gem was white in colour with flashing grey stripes on his back. He was a very clever specimen of Siberian huskies. Gem nudged him again, this time more persistently. D.T was staring at him, with his eyebrow raised like a question mark. </p> <p>\"Well?\" he asked. </p> <p>\"I accept\", replied Jewel in a grim tone. This was his fifteenth mission. </p> <p>Jewel was to be kitted with the translator Bluetooth communications headset; Pulse, heat, x-ray and thermal vision; SR-98 sniper rifle, Walther P99 and a helmet with complete arctic warfare gear.</p> <p>Jewel slept through the ride on the giant Hercules airplane. It had a modified Jet engine and was able to hover on the spot, which it did as soon as it was time for Jewel and Gem to parachute into the mountains. Jewel was nervous to jump off when the ramp opened up. He took a running leap and dived off, expecting to feel the rush of wind on his face but the mask and goggles repelled it all. The next thing he knew, his parachute opened with a jerk,<br>pulling him up as the air got trapped in. He landed next to a metal box. The lookout point! He rushed through the blizzard and opened the front door.</p> <p>It was surprisingly warm inside. A fire glowed brightly in the hearth. A set of snug sofas and chairs stood around a 'SAMSUNG 52 POLEGADAS 1080 3D TOUCH SCREEN' television set. An XBOX was connected into the panel behind it. A boy stood in the room, examining a set of 3d blueprints on the TV. He turned around and gave Jewel a bright smile. </p> <p>\"Hello Jewel. I'm Keshav, but you can call me Snipes. This is my helping hand, Dash!\" He pointed to a dog in a camouflage suit, sitting at his feet. He was a chocolate brown Miniature Pinscher. \"Come in. I'll give you something to eat. Would you like Indian or Chinese cuisine?\" </p> <p>Two hours later, Jewel was seated on a comfy sofa. He was watching the screen. Keshav was giving an explanation on how the mine worked. </p> <p>\"The workers are under a spell. I can guarantee it. I think that the spell works from the bottom of the mine. If we can get to the control room, we can break<br>the charm and help the miners. There's something we're not being told but don't ponder over it tonight and have sweet dreams.\"</p> <p><strong>1 Day Ago:</strong></p> <p>They had been scouting the mine for four days. Now, it was time to move in on the target. They were kitted up again. Keshav and Dash led Jewel and Gem into an underground bunker where the weapons were stored. It was sealed with a passcode. Jewel was surprised by the amount of crates that were stacked around him. Keshav opened one to reveal two white snowmobiles that were packed with emergency gear. A walk ahead revealed an armored jeep. This was their escape transport system. </p> <p>He jumped in and closed the door to reveal a warm interior. Keshav got in beside him.</p> <p>\"I'll drive,\" said Jewel. He typed the coordinates into the SATNAV. They got to see the mine from the close mountain. Jewel held up binoculars and looked through to reveal a closer view of the complex. There was a ski jump leading to the control room. There were many heavy cranes and buildings. The area was crawling with guards. Keshav extracted the snowmobiles and they set off into the blizzard that formed around them.</p> <p>They rode silently to the ski jump, dropping any of the guards that came by. They were soon streaking down a sparkling white set of stairs. They ditched the mobiles and snuck up to the door of the control room. Keshav kicked it open and ran in, screaming orders in Russian. Jewel hefted his Dragunov and followed. He was surprised to find the control room filled with people. A red man sat in front of them. A smaller version of this man sneered at them from behind him. </p> <p>\"Hello, Welcome to the room of hell! I'm Devil, your host for tonight. You must be the boys that Dump Thump sent me!\"</p> <p>Jewel was tied to a chair and was forced to listen to the man's words. Gem was thrown onto his chest and against the man's wishes; it provided him a small comfort. The man looked at them. He took a breath and began to speak.</p> <p>\"I was born 4.55 billion years ago. I was an interesting child. I was able to do evil things. They called me De Vilan. That's old world talk for the 'Judge of Life.' That is what I became: Devil. I have planned something great for the world. It is the greatest calamity of all. I have always wanted to be king!\" He paused and spoke again. \"I could not rule a living world. Now I will rule a dead world!\" He laughed like a maniac. </p> <p>That was when a worker interrupted, \" Sir! Our magic level is going down in the pot. Please do something!\" </p> <p>The young devil walked to an oozing cauldron beside him and said some gibberish. The metal vessel filled again. </p> <p>\"Sir! The mine is vibrating! It is beginning!\" </p> <p>\"Yes!\" screamed Devil. He walked to the bank of computers on the side. Then the world exploded!</p> <p><strong>Present Time:</strong></p> <p>Jewel woke up. It had been almost 24 hours since he had been wounded. Chaos was all around him. He got to his feet, only to lose his center of balance again. Keshav was standing over him. He pulled Jewel onto his shoulder. Dash did the same for Gem. They were off.</p> <p>A figure was coming out of the pit, spitting fire. The iced edges of the mine had melted. Keshav supported Jewel to a nearby lift and helped him in. Jewel was relieved when he saw the bright light of the outside world. He got to his feet and struggled to the door. The miners ran up and down. Jewel realized that he was on a platform high above the mine. The C4 they had planted at ground level had exploded, ripping the mine apart. The noise of screaming men scared him. He pushed through the crowd and to the exit of the mine. </p> <p>The young devil appeared in front of him. </p> <p>\"This is your fault! My father is dead! I will kill you!\" </p> <p>He lunged forward, dagger in hand. Jewel dodged him. The boy changed his form into that of a bull. An imaginary voice rang out behind Jewel's temple: <em>Senores, Senoritas! Witness the battle to death!</em> The bull lunged towards him. </p> <p>\"Nobody can stop me unless my brain is blown out!\" And his brain was blown out. Good thing. Bad thing, it was scrambled on the white, icy ground (and unfortunately onto Jewel's protective suit). Keshav had fired from his gun! The boy (bull, same thing) fell. His dagger slipped away. </p> <p>Keshav resumed his journey to the Snipes' Mobile. As he passed the mine pit, he threw all the last bags of C4 into it. They came into contact with the figure and exploded. He screamed in pain and began to sink back down into the earth. Jewel was in the car before he knew it. He drifted into a dream world as the car started up and drove away. He knew that every turn of the wheel would lead him away from the horrible pit.</p> <p><strong>7 Days Later:</strong></p> <p>Keshav was a little nervous. They were sitting side by side in Dump Thump's study. The kangaroo himself sat in front of them.</p> <p>\"I know you are wanting an explanation. The giant creature in the mine was a Contonenta. He was one of the seven. He was one of the last too. The red man was Devil. He was the cause for the horrible carelessness of the humans. Now that he and his son are dead the world is going green again. You have restored peace to us. Devil planned to raise the Contonenta so that he could destroy the world. You have ended a war since the start of time. Your missions are over for now. Our department will close down. Goodbye!\" He shook their hands. They were escorted outside.</p> <p>D.T smiled to himself. He had set it all up. It was the only way to end the pollution and his tiresome job. He had schemed with the Devil. He had sent him to the core of the earth and he had brought back the key to open the door to the Contonenta. He had not disclosed to him the end result. Dump Thump allowed himself another gleeful grin. He merrily began to shut down the Globe through his computer. The happy days were just about to begin!</p> <p>D.T was thought to be a kangaroo aiming for world domination. The truth is that he was actually trying to save the world from the distribution of toxic waste and greenhouse gases that mingle with the earth's atmosphere. These are the tools that cause global warming. </p> <p>We must always remember that the world is the only life-bearing planet, but its resources are fast being consumed. We must be aware and try to maintain the planet. Many natural species such as trees give us oxygen. If we fell forests and set up mines, oil-rigs and other industries like these, we are draining the earth, polluting it and endangering animals and humans alike. </p> <p>All living things have a right to live, and just because we are stronger and often more intelligent, it doesn't mean that we should destroy their natural habitats to create new ones for us. If this happens to us, we would think it to be an act of robbery and crime.</p> <p>Krazy Kesh's Perspective:</p> <p>Prevent<br>Protect<br>Preserve</p> <p><strong>Are you a budding writer or poet? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your scribblings!</strong></p>",
  "<h2><strong>1. 'White van' Conservatism is now the dominant ideology in the party</strong></h2> <p>The phrase comes from Robert Halfon, the Harlow MP, but other Tories talk about blue collar Conservatism or helping the \"strivers\", and Eric Pickles puts it in terms of Essex values. Alternatively, you could call it Tabloid Toryism, or just Thatcherism. It's the thread that binds together all the main announcements at the conference, such as curbs on benefit claimants, the \"stab-a-burglar\" law, tougher punishments for offenders and the council-tax freeze. Individually, these policies may be quite popular, but collectively they depict a grim picture of Britain, which is why the \"nasty party\" label has been heard again in Birmingham. There was almost nothing at the conference about quality of life issues and David Cameron's \"let sunshine rule the day\" is now just a distant memory.</p> <h2><strong>2. The Conservatives are not worried about 'one nation' Labour</strong></h2> <p>They believe it is an empty marketing slogan and it is clear they are going to fight Labour in 2015 exactly as they did in 2010 \u2013 by attacking the party as financially irresponsible. The Conservatives have spent all week trying to assert their own one nation credentials although, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/08/osborne-speech-conservative-conference-live-blog#block-5072d322c0e361310bc6c9dc\" title=\"\">as George Osborne made clear in his speech</a>, there's a difference between their one nation and Labour's. Theirs is for strivers; benefit claimants who lie in bed with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/08/curtains-closed-blinds-down-george-osborne\" title=\"\">\"blinds down\"</a> instead of going to work aren't included.</p> <h2><strong>3. The 'big society' is over</strong></h2> <p>It was Cameron's big idea at the 2010 election, but even then it was a hard sell electorally and prolonged austerity seems to have finished it off.</p> <p>We're told that Cameron is going to reaffirm his commitment to the idea in his speech later. But, without having read the speech, it is hard to see how this will amount to much more than a concession to nostalgia. No one else has been talking about the big society at the conference and, as an ideological frame for policy, it seems to have collapsed.</p> <h2><strong>4. The Conservatives are more worried than Labour about the threat to Britain's long-term economic future posed by globalisation</strong></h2> <p>William Hague made this point on the Today programme on Wednesday but that doesn't mean it's not true. At Labour's conference very little was said about the impact of competition from China, but figures like Hague and Osborne have been issuing dire warnings about European countries being condemned to poverty if they fail to keep up with the Asian economic superpowers and Cameron is going to say the same thing in his speech later. This case is set out in detail in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, a new book by five 2010-intake Tory MPs. It's a key text in the party at the moment although, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/09/britannia-unhinged-young-tory-right-set-out-their-stall\" title=\"\">as my colleague Paul Owen found when he attended a Britannia Unchained fringe, some of its conclusions are unpalatable</a>.</p> <h2><strong>5. Boris Johnson is the most potent force in Conservative politics (maybe even British politics) but he has postponed a challenge to David Cameron</strong></h2> <p>Johnson's reception at Birmingham was extraordinary \u2013 even Bill Clinton at Labour in 2002 failed to generate so much excitement \u2013 and, through some unholy alchemy involving ego, wit, optimism and good cheer, he has become a figure who transcends party politics. He said nothing incompatible with white van Conservatism, but his speech was the most uplifting we've heard all week because it was relentlessly positive. Johnson was loyal to Cameron, and insisted he would not try to get elected to parliament before 2016, although, with glorious chutzpah, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-conservative-party-conference-live#block-5073fb1058f91d7bbadac14a\" title=\"\">he actually included a joke in his conference speech about how he sometimes breaks his promises</a>. Cameron should be worried. But Labour should worry about Johnson too.</p> <h2><strong>6. Cameron has averted a rebellion over Europe</strong></h2> <p>Europe was tipped as a conference flashpoint, but, although the subject kept coming up in fringe meetings, there were no public rows. Cameron has come closer to announcing a referendum on the EU, and, broadly, his party seems happy with this.</p> <h2><strong>7. Council tax increases have become politically unpalatable \u2013 which suggests the system is bust</strong></h2> <p>In one of the most expensive announcements of the week (although one which received relatively little media attention), the Tories announced that they will fund a council-tax freeze for another year. In Scotland the SNP also refuses to sanction council-tax increases. Taxpayers benefit in the short term, but councillors find central interference of this kind infuriating and it means that the existing local-government funding model is becoming unworkable.</p> <h2><strong>8. Internal Conservative party modernisation has stalled</strong></h2> <p>The Labour MP Phil Wilson once said Labour won an election on 1 May 1997 and stopped reforming the party on 2 May 1997. The same thing has happened to the Conservative party since 2010. What has happened to the A-list? Or to open primaries? There have also been complaints about the efficiency of the party machine and having a party chairman who has spent the week avoiding jibes about Michael Green hasn't helped either.</p> <h2><strong>9. Andrew Mitchell will find it hard to hang on as chief whip</strong></h2> <p>If he thought that by avoiding the conference he could make the controversy about his anti-police rant blow over, he was wrong. When he appeared on a video shown at the Johnson rally on Monday night, members cheered ironically, as if he were an object of derision. For reasons that <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/graemearcher/100184381/what-do-tory-activists-want-how-about-an-end-to-the-smug-upper-class-stereotype-andrew-mitchell-embodies/\" title=\"\">Graeme Archer explains quite well on his Telegraph blog</a>, the conference has illustrated just how much damage Mitchell has done to the party and there are now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frasernelson/status/255831457518481408\" title=\"\">strong suggestions</a> that he will soon resign.</p> <h2><strong>10. The Conservatives are not optimistic about their prospects in the police commissioner elections</strong></h2> <p>Next month most voters in England and Wales will get the chance to take part in what is virtually a nationwide poll. You would expect the party to be on full election alert. But, generally, the Tories have not been showcasing their candidates and the elections only received a modest slot in the conference programme. That suggests expectations are low. The Tories have also written off Corby, which is why Louise Mensch was loudly booed when she appeared in a video at the Johnson rally.</p>",

Scientists knew that hormones such as adrenalin had powerful effects: increasing blood pressure and making the heart beat faster. They suspected that cell surfaces contained some kind of recipient for hormones. But what these receptors actually consisted of and how they worked remained obscured for most of the 20th Century.</p> <p>Cells in our body are constantly exposed to a variety of chemical signals\u2014hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and sometimes even drugs\u2014that they need to interpret and translate into a response. This task is handled by receptors that dot cell membranes. Lefkowitz essentially defined the field of receptor biology through his work with G protein\u2013coupled receptors, the largest and most pervasive family of cell receptors. A thousand or more of these receptors are known to exist throughout the body, playing critical roles in sight, smell, and taste, and in regulating heart rate, blood pressure, pain tolerance, glucose metabolism, and virtually all known physiological processes.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1531c47b-52cb-41a0-a447-7a60e02e2eb7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879898434/Chemistry-Nobel-prizewinn-010.jpg\" alt=\"Chemistry Nobel prizewinner Robert Lefkowitz in his lab\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lefkowitz in his lab at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in 1996.

And people proposed that there must be specific receptors on the surface of cells which looked for materials that would then modify the cell behaviour or cell signalling or whatever. But until Lefkowitz and Kobilka came along nobody actually had isolated these things, so their real triumph very early on was to show that you could isolate these sensors and what they sensed. And what they sense is actually quite staggering. They sense light \u2026 flavour, smell, adrenaline, which of course is hugely important because when adrenaline is there your heart rate increases and your pulse rate increases and your blood pressure increases and that's the fight or flight response that all animals get. Histamine is sensed that way, and that's important in allergy; dopamine is sensed that way, and that's important in cell transmission and used in treating Parkinson's for example; serotonin, which affects how you sense light and dark and regulate the body that way. And it's true that half of all medications achieve their effect through G-protein-coupled receptors.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hear the full interview below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka#t=2m56s\"> <object data=\"http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf\" height=\"129\" id=\"boo_embed_999482\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf\"></param><param name=\"scale\" value=\"noscale\"></param><param name=\"salign\" value=\"lt\"></param><param name=\"bgColor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"window\"></param><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;mp3Title=Interview+with+Professor+David+Phillips%2C+immediate+past-president+of+the+Royal+Society+of+Chemistry+about+the+2012+Nobel+prize+in+chemistry+winners%2C+Robert+Lefkowitz+and+Brian+Kobilka&amp;mp3Time=10.46am+10+Oct+2012&amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka&amp;mp3Author=iansample&amp;rootID=boo_embed_999482\"></param><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka.mp3?keyed=true&amp;source=embed\">Interview with Professor David Phillips, immediate past-president of the Royal Society of Chemistry about the 2012 Nobel prize in chemistry winners, Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka (mp3)</a></object> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-10T11:09:43.956Z\">at 12.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507550a0c0e361310bc6cb3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-10T10:40:46.934Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ffea2059-6418-40be-b7d2-8950d60747bd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349865378033/Chemistry-Nobel-prizewinn-010.jpg\" alt=\"Chemistry Nobel prizewinner Robert Lefkowitz\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Lefkowitz of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

Kobilka loathes the limelight, and is renowned as much for his shy modesty as his ability to crack seemingly impossible protein structures. When I met Kobilka at his Stanford office, he accepted a quick handshake, averting his eyes, and reluctantly offered me a seat across from him at his desk. He stared anxiously at the glowing red light on my voice recorder. He is \"desperately fearful\" of talking to the press, he says, his voice breaking, and only agreed to talk because he \"wanted to make sure that the contributions of my lab and collaborators are recognized\".</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d96418b7-a326-4a21-8724-d35de7cb2686\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879066610/Chemistry-Nobel-prizewinn-010.jpg\" alt=\"Chemistry Nobel prizewinner Brian Kobilka\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kobilka speaks on the phone at his home in Palo Alto after hearing he has been awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry.

Each cell has tiny receptors that enable it to sense its environment, so it can adapt to new situtations. <strong>Robert Lefkowitz </strong>and <strong>Brian Kobilka </strong>are awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for groundbreaking discoveries that reveal the inner workings of an important family of such receptors: G-protein\u2013coupled receptors.</p> </blockquote> <p>and some more:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a long time, it remained a mystery how cells could sense their environment. Scientists knew that hormones such as adrenalin had powerful effects: increasing blood pressure and making the heart beat faster. They suspected that cell surfaces contained some kind of recipient for hormones. But what these receptors actually consisted of and how they worked remained obscured for most of the 20th Century.</p> <p>Lefkowitz started to use radioactivity in 1968 in order to trace cells' receptors. He attached an iodine isotope to various hormones, and thanks to the radiation, he managed to unveil several receptors, among those a receptor for adrenalin: \u03b2-adrenergic receptor. His team of researchers extracted the receptor from its hiding place in the cell wall and gained an initial understanding of how it works.</p> <p>The team achieved its next big step during the 1980s. The newly recruited Kobilka accepted the challenge to isolate the gene that codes for the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor from the gigantic human genome. His creative approach allowed him to attain his goal. When the researchers analyzed the gene, they discovered that the receptor was similar to one in the eye that captures light. They realized that there is a whole family of receptors that look alike and function in the same manner.</p> <p>Today this family is referred to as G-protein\u2013coupled receptors. About a thousand genes code for such receptors, for example, for light, flavour, odour, adrenalin, histamine, dopamine and serotonin. About half of all medications achieve their effect through G-protein\u2013coupled receptors.</p> <p>The studies by Lefkowitz and Kobilka are crucial for understanding how G-protein\u2013coupled receptors function. Furthermore, in 2011, Kobilka achieved another break-through; he and his research team captured an image of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor at the exact moment that it is activated by a hormone and sends a signal into the cell. This image is a molecular masterpiece \u2013 the result of decades of research.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507544d3c0e361310bc6cb2a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-10T09:50:11.838Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Winners announced</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This year's chemistry Nobel prize winners have been announced:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/lefkowitz_bio.html\">Robert J.

  "<p><em>Cricketer Isa Guha was the first Asian woman to play for England, making her debut in 2002 at the age of 17. She was the number one bowler in the women's world rankings in 2008.</em></p> <p>Coming from an Asian background, a love for cricket was instilled in me at an early age. My parents came to England from Kolkata in the 70s, and my brother and I were born here. I have a tremendous affiliation with England because it's the country where I was born and bred, and I will always support England first in the cricket. Except for when they're not playing and India is - then I'll support India. It's important not to forget your roots, but it's also important not to take for granted what growing up in England has given me either.</p> <p>I started playing cricket as a little girl, when I was about eight years old. My brother, who is seven years older than me, used to play for our local club and was always practicing in the back garden; I used to run around after the ball. My parents could tell I was interested in it too, so they took me down to the local club as well. There were no other girls, so I just started playing with the boys. I loved getting them out. When I was 11, I got selected for the Thames Valley Under-21 side, and it all spiralled from there. I met <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/29/england-women-india-twenty20\">Charlotte Edwards</a> a year later, when she was 16 and playing for England, and that's when I realised I wanted to play for England too.</p> <p>I went to an all-girls school and cricket wasn't much of an option there. Things are changing now; cricket is a lot more accessible to young girls than it was when I was growing up. If girls at schools see women cricketers coaching them, then it will make them get excited about it and see the possibilities. </p> <p>When I first started playing cricket for England, there was hardly any coverage. But now the level of competition has evolved, and people are starting to take notice. There's still a lot more that can be done, but now is a really interesting time for women's cricket because it's not just Australia and New Zealand playing any more. England's women's team is doing so well, and what we've achieved is pretty exciting.</p> <p>Asian parents generally tend to channel their children, especially their daughters, into studying and not sport. I see a lot of Asian girls playing cricket now, but they all tend to drop off when they hit 16 or 17 years old and give it up. I was lucky, because my parents always encouraged me. I feel a responsibility now to set an example to other Asians, and that also makes me feel proud.</p> <p>I took the decision to retire from England this year. It was a huge decision to make, because cricket has been part of my life for so long. But I was struggling more and more with my back, and I had to make a choice about which way I wanted to go - when you play cricket only semi-professionally, as women's cricket is, then there comes a point when you need to think about earning a proper living too. </p> <p>I would love to see girls playing top-level cricket <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/19712359\">get equal pay</a>, but at the moment, men's cricket fills grounds whereas women's doesn't. Until we get that level of spectatorship, we won't earn the same money. <br> To people who don't take women's cricket seriously, I'd say: just watch a game first, and then make your judgement. You'll see. England is leading the way in women's cricket.</p>",

The 21st century has become a world dependent on technology, yet while 84% of non-disabled people live in households with internet access, only about 60% of disabled people can say the same. The truth is that even if they do go online, they do not have the same choice or access to all the products and services that everyone else has.</p> <p>We have worked with visually impaired people who have chosen to bank with a particular financial institution not out of choice, but because other financial institutions were simply not accessible. Although assistive technologies (such as screen readers) are available for use, the core issue is that the majority of websites have problems with access. Disabled users may not be able to read site menus or access specific tools designed to enable product choice, simply because the website may not be optimised for use with their screen reader. Inevitably, these banks will lose these customers as they go to competitors who have recognised the problem.</p> <p>We conducted our own research, testing the web pages of 11 leading banks and building societies, to determine which areas needed to be improved and what main problems disabled people are most likely to encounter. These included web pages, links, pictures and forms not being labelled correctly (meaning that a person using a screen reader would get lost on the site) and broken tabs, or \"skip navigation links\", which allow those who cannot use a mouse to navigate the site.</p> <p>Barclays was rated as the worst offender, failing on 35 out of 64 tests, followed by NatWest, which failed 34, and Santander and HSBC which failed 27 each. Lloyds, Halifax, Nationwide, ING, Smile, Citibank and First Direct all failed 18 times.</p> <p>Given that disabled people collectively spend more than \u00a380bn a year on products and services, it is not really a market that any business can afford to ignore. Research by Capgemini in its World Retail Banking Customer Experience report last year found that quality of service and ease of use are the two biggest factors that affect people's decision to leave a bank. The study also found that customers in every region rank the internet as one of their most important channels, yet for disabled users it is not necessarily the case. All banks have accessibility issues and this can undermine loyalty and lead to lost customers.</p> <h2>Accessibility best practices</h2> <p>So what can be done? First, it's law under the Equality Act for website owners to ensure their websites are accessible to users with disabilities. Businesses need to learn what this means to them. The <a href=\"http://www.shaw-trust.org.uk/page/3/59/\" title=\"\">Shaw Trust's website accessibility accreditation service</a> is a service that enables businesses to make their website accessible to all their visitors. We ensure the websites follow the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/\" title=\"\">web content accessibility guidelines</a> (WCAG).</p> <p>The guidelines are based on best practice ideals and are put in place to make sure no user is excluded due to disability or choice of device or software. Accessibility needs to be implemented at the earliest stage of the design process and we highly advise that websites work with the oldest technology to prevent exclusion of certain individuals. It should come as no surprise that one of the best ways of ensuring a business' website is accessible is to involve disabled people during the design and production process. One aspect of Shaw Trust accreditation is to have our websites tested by experienced web editors, all of whom are disabled individuals and users of adaptive technology.</p> <h2>Where do the difficulties lie?</h2> <p>One of the main barriers to web accessibility is because designers and web developers are often unaware of accessibility practices. This means that many websites may not work with assistive technologies, thus preventing disabled users from accessing services or functions. The Equality Act recognises the lack of compliance standards and is making inroads into the public sector's perception of access issues.</p> <h2>What role does web accessibility play in the future for disabled users?</h2> <p>The virtual world may be without walls, but there certainly are barriers. We consider the UK to be a country of egalitarian values but when the disabled are left behind in what has become an ingrained part of everyday life, the issue needs to be addressed.</p> <p>Following a Shaw Trust web accessibility conference geared towards top financial institutions in Stratford last week, it was clear there is a desire for change by the banks but a lack of understanding of how. This was enlightening. As long as there is a will and that Paralympic spirit lives on, there is definitely a way.</p> <p><em>Ian Lyons is a sales manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.shaw-trust.org.uk/home\" title=\"\"><em>the Shaw Trust</em></a><em>, the largest third sector provider of employment services in the UK.

  "<p>I start with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asyndeton\" title=\"\"><strong>asyndeton</strong></a>. Short sentences. Bundled together. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/10/david-cameron-tories\" title=\"\">groups of three</a>. Sounds breathless. Urgent. Hyperventilating. No conjunctions. Wonky grammar. Disconnected ideas. Look left. Look right. Look centre. They're listening. They're watching. They're feeling. Then stop. Pause. Breathe.</p> <p>For now the time has come for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_%28rhetoric%29\" title=\"\"><strong>anaphora</strong></a>, where I repeat the opening clauses of three successive sentences to show that I am a strong man with a strong sense of purpose. Yes, the time has come for anaphora, where I repeat the opening clauses of three successive sentences to show that I am a strong man \u2013 clearly fixated upon a single course of action. I tell you \u2013 the time has come for anaphora, where I repeat the opening clauses of three successive sentences to show that I am not a weedy winkling, but a big, big man \u2013 vaguely redolent of Churchill.</p> <p>Then stop anaphora, and start <strong>antithesis</strong> \u2013 or contrast. For I know, as Britain's prime minister, that if I give them three contrasts in a row, I will sound not bonkers, but balanced; not partisan, but judicial; not emotional, but logical. My ideas may be tautologous \u2013 moving forward, not backward; making Britain stronger, not weaker; looking to the future, not the past \u2013 but it really doesn't matter. I can say whatever I damn well like \u2013 because as long as I wrap a rhetorical contrast around my words, I'm guaranteed to sound measured, not mad.</p> <p>Then, while the contrasts are still ricocheting around the audience, I have a great opportunity to sneak in unnoticed and plant a <strong>metaphor</strong> deep within the audience's fertile minds. I will then love, care for and nurture that metaphor, gently sprinkling, feeding and watching over it, encouraging it to take root and grow. But if it looks as if it is growing to excess, getting out of control, then I will not hesitate to take out my shears and prune it back \u2013 I need my metaphor to propagate among the audience and hopefully spread it into the media and, crucially, grow into the national consciousness.</p> <p>But then it is time for the <strong>hyperbole</strong>. This is my favourite part of the speech. It is the bit where I can get thoroughly carried away, ludicrously overstating my case to the -nth degree, outrageously making the most over-the-top promises I can possibly imagine, even though I have no chance of ever keeping them. At this point, I look like an evangelist, a pulpit preacher \u2013 like a more deranged version of <a href=\"http://www.billygraham.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Billy Graham</a> or a more sane version of Tony Blair.</p> <p>I might talk about night and day, good and evil, fire and water, light and dark, the right way and the wrong way. I might talk about how, under the Conservatives, every person \u2013 rich and poor, young and old, black and white \u2013 will be wealthier, healthier and happier. I might talk about how I dream that Britain will be a place in which every single person in the whole country can reach their full potential regardless of their race, religion or background \u2013 whether they've been to Eton or Westminster, Oxford or Cambridge, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/01/george-osborne-bullingdon-club-chancellor\" title=\"\">Bullingdon</a> or the Athenaeum. I might talk about how I will never be able to sleep until the great and mighty spirit of Britannia is once again towering over the world, slaying the tyrants, spreading freedom, conquering slaves and ruling waves.</p> <p>And to end? With <strong>brevitas</strong>, of course. The Ultimate Cameron. Short sentences. Short words. But full of meaning. Because we can. Because we get it. Because we dare. Like that. And we do get it. But now I must stop. I came. I saw. I spoke. I've been David Cameron. I'm here all week. Thank you. And good night.</p>",

She was unconscious but had moved her hand slightly after coming out of surgery.</p> <p>Malala could be moved abroad for further treatment. A plane is on standby in Peshawar and Rehman Malik, the interior minister, has contacted the family to make sure their passports are in order.</p> <p>Three years ago Malala blogged on the BBC website about the terror of living amid a rising Taliban insurgency. Last year she received the country's first peace prize. She was on a Taliban hitlist for publicly advocating what the movement derides as \"secular governance\".</p> <p>On Tuesday morning as she and her classmates sat on a bus to take them home after a midterm exam, three men reportedly approached in search of Malala.</p> <p>\"The man who stopped the vehicle signalled to his other armed accomplices that Yousafzai was inside,\" the bus driver, Usman Ali, told the Express Tribune newspaper. \"Another armed man went to the back of the vehicle and started firing inside.\"</p> <p>Malala attempted to deny her own identity, but one of the other girls pointed her out. According to the Express Tribune, a total of four girls, including Malala, were injured.</p> <p>On Tuesday the Taliban appeared more than happy to take the credit for the attempted murder. \"She was pro-west, she was speaking against Taliban and she was calling President Obama her ideal leader,\" said a spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan. \"She was young but she was promoting western culture in Pashtun areas.\"</p> <p>The attack has horrified many in Pakistan, especially liberals who have long been aghast at what they see as the feeble response by the state and some religious political parties towards the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani offshoot of the hardline Islamist movement that closed down girl's schools and ran public executions when it was in power in Afghanistan in the 1990s.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Pakistan's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the attack. Even the head of Pakistan's military, General Ashfaq Kayani, made public his anger during a meeting with Malala's parents at a military hospital in Peshawar.</p> <p>The attack has alarmed residents of Swat, which was infiltrated by Taliban insurgents who burned schools and executed its enemies. An operation by the Pakistani military eventually forced the Taliban out of the valley in 2009, but the attempt to kill Malala indicates their continued ability to mount attacks in an area still living under a heavy army presence.</p> <p>\"The suicide bombings and blasts may be over in Swat but this attack has rung alarm bells reminding us that militants are still in Swat,\" said Iqbal Hussain, one of Malala's teachers.</p> <p>He said the girl's classmates were anxious to return to school despite the attack. \"Girls of Swat are courageous and bold and they want to continue their education they cannot be bettered by these tactics of the militants,\" Hussain said.</p>",
  "<p>Procurement is starting to get recognition as a major contributor to company growth. In fact, as the economy continues to present a bleak outlook, chief procurement officers (CPOs) are becoming increasingly important members of the boardroom.</p> <p>Procurement is responsible for both optimising costs and reporting on any savings achieved, and delivering more tangible benefits to the business. These include: negotiating multi-million pound contracts, enabling the introduction of innovative new processes and managing major offshoring operations. But despite the opportunities, there remains a shortage of talented graduates looking to enter the profession.</p> <p>Initially, procurement may not have the same appeal as a career in law or auditing, but the profession has much to offer today's graduates. Salaries are <a href=\"http://www.cips.org/Careers/salarysurvey/\" title=\"\">on par with those in other more prominent sectors</a>, including marketing, finance, IT and human resources, and the increase in board level appointments \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.procurementleaders.com/news/news/33-more-us-companies-put-cpos-at-board-level\" title=\"\">up 33% in the USA and 15% in Europe in 2012</a> \u2013 means procurement professionals can reach top positions.</p> <p>Another benefit is the early exposure to senior level stakeholders. For example, our analysts usually work with stakeholders within weeks or even days of joining 4C. Procurement is very much a sector in which doors are there to be opened and performance, more than seniority, drives career progression.</p> <p>Procurement can also offer a wide variety of different projects. Some may require a focus on analytics and delivering rapid cost savings, others may call for a more hands-on approach. Examples range from benchmarking marketing agencies to designing more effective supply chains. Working for a consultancy will increase the likelihood of collaborating on a multitude of projects.</p> <p>The sheer variety of sectors that procurement comes into contact with also makes it appealing for anyone looking for new challenges. Procurement is predominantly outwards focused; you collaborate with individuals from various sectors, gaining a wealth of cross-industry experience. In my career I've managed a range of projects, including major IT outsourcing and procuring cricket scoreboards.</p> <p>Despite the advantages, procurement is still an extremely challenging career choice. Whether you're dealing with difficult suppliers or working through a company merger, you will be tested. The people who prosper in this industry have strong presentation and analytical skills and can communicate their ideas through a wide range of formats to a variety of stakeholders.</p> <p>Procurement represents a fantastic choice for graduates looking for a varied and exciting role with great career prospects. This is one of the few sectors where new employees are given the opportunity to prove their worth and take charge of their own projects, from start to finish. The current economic climate has seen an increasing number of businesses turn to their CPOs to deliver growth and improve margins. This recognition will serve to cement procurement's place in the boardroom and increase the profile of those in the sector.</p> <p><em>Guy Allen is managing partner at </em><a href=\"http://www.4cassociates.com/\" title=\"\"><em>4C Associates</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>This week's comedy news</h2> <p>Thirty years after the broadcast of its pilot episode, a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19834447\" title=\"\">lost episode of Blackadder has been discovered</a>. Author Jem Roberts was handed the draft script by writer Richard Curtis while he was researching a new book on the series. According to BBC News, Blackadder in Bethlehem is a comic take on the nativity, with Rowan Atkinson's character the owner of the inn where Joseph and Mary seek a bed for the night. In Roberts's book, it's claimed Curtis abandoned the idea for fear of causing offence, and of drawing comparison with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36114/life-of-brian\" title=\"\">Life of Brian</a>. The script was substituted by Blackadder's Christmas Carol, a Dickensian variant on the formula.

At the Comedy International conference in London, industry insiders have spoken about the reluctance of arts centres and theatres to book acts who have not already been on TV. According to promoter Mick Perrin, who works with performers including Eddie Izzard and Tommy Tiernan, \"People get so much comedy on TV, they don't need to venture out. It's great for some comedians, but for the majority, it's not.\" In the Telegraph, meanwhile, the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.hattrick.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hat Trick</a> \u2013 producers of Have I Got News for You, Outnumbered and many more \u2013 has hailed <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9592586/Hat-Trick-boss-hits-out-at-BBC-dinosaurs-as-profits-surge.html\" title=\"\">a \"golden age\" for independent production companies</a>. \"The independent production sector is now, strangely, the core production centre of Britain \u2013 not the BBC and not ITV,\" Jimmy Mulville says. \"If you had said to me, 'One day you guys will be the establishment and these guys will be the dinosaurs', I wouldn't have believed it, but that is what has happened.\" Mulville also questioned the system that ensures half of all BBC programmes are made by its in-house production unit. \"If you were inventing the BBC today, you would not have the huge overhead of an in-house production company that can only pitch to one customer.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere in comedy, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Mack\" title=\"\">Lee Mack</a> reveals in his new memoir that <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/10/03/16251/lee_mack%3A_i_shouldnt_have_ditched_my_mates\" title=\"\">he regrets jilting sidekicks Catherine Tate and Dan Antopolski</a> when first offered a TV break.

The following day, she spoke again to insist that her comments not be used as a stick to beat the BBC \u2013 which is how the Daily Mail and others seem to be approaching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/08/jimmy-savile-jersey-childrens-home\" title=\"\">the whole Savile controversy</a>. \"It's not about the BBC, and I'm distressed it's being portrayed in that way,\" she said.</p> <p>The other comedy presence in the row is Freddie Starr, who brought out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/05/freddie-starr-denies-girl\" title=\"\">an injunction against allegations that he groped a 14-year-old girl</a> at a party hosted by Savile and Gary Glitter. The injunction was overturned, and Starr came out fighting. \"Don't tar me with the same brush as a scumbag and a paedophile,\" he was quoted as saying. Starr also denied appearing on the TV show Clunk Click with Savile \u2013 but then was obliged to admit he was wrong when <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9595319/Freddie-Starr-did-appear-on-Jimmy-Savile-show-with-accuser.html\" title=\"\">footage came to light of Starr on the show</a>, alongside the woman who claims he molested her. His lawyer told Channel 4 News that Starr \"cannot be expected to recollect every show that he has appeared on and to remember every person that he has ever met\".</p> <p>A lively conversation followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/03/tv-review-kenny-everett-story\" title=\"\">John Crace's review of Best Possible Taste, the Kenny Everett biopic</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18640895\" title=\"\">Scousetone</a> loved the man, but not necessarily the TV dramatisation of his life:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't think there was a 'story' there. Everett came across as shallow, manic, desperate for love and attention. But he was doing 'zoo' radio and TV lightyears before anyone else, and was a supreme studio talent. Everett was the antithesis of bland presenters like Blackburn and DLT; and the appearance of Hot Gossip on telly always made my Grandad come over all unnecessary. Like most great radio presenters (Peel, Freeman, etc), the body of work is infinitely more important than the life story we crave.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18649881\" title=\"\">Whitehorsehill</a> was one among many disappointed in the programme's focus on Everett's sexuality:</p> <blockquote> <p>Now this was why Victoria Wood's Eric and Ernie was so good 18 months ago. She was interested in the talent, not 'the heart-breaking story of a man unable to come to terms with his sexuality', which seems to be the mainstay of comedy biopics on BBC4 these days. Fantabulosa with Michael Sheen was witty and original, but to have to watch programmes on Hughie Green, Frankie Howerd, Hattie Jacques, Hancock, Harry H Corbett and now Everett and to ignore the very thing that made them great? I can only assume it is symptomatic of a generation of second-rate hacks who are trying to drag true genius down to their level.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was nothing, though, to the volume of argy-bargy after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/oct/05/jack-whitehall-interview-class-act\" title=\"\">Alexis Petridis's interview with Marmite comedian Jack Whitehall</a>, which devolved into a (very) spirited dispute about class and comedy. Among the early (and more civilised) exchanges, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18690173\" title=\"\">acryanshame</a> came out in Whitehall's favour:</p> <blockquote> <p>Never heard of Whitehall before Bad Education, but I really dug that show and he wrote most of the episodes himself, so don't see why people are slagging him off for being posh? David Mitchell is, too, and everyone loves him \u2026 Like Mitchell, Whitehall seems aware of how ridiculous people of his kind of background can be.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18690291\" title=\"\">Greg33</a> is one of several insisting that their dislike of Whitehall has nothing to do with social background:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't hate him because he is posh.

  "<p>\"I was struggling in so many areas of my life,\" recalls Ellie, 18, who lived in a foster placement for three years from the age of 14.</p> <p>\"I'd go out, get drunk, get arrested. I met this guy from youth offending, and at first he was a really nice boy. But then things started to change. I'd hold his drugs, his money, his gun. It got really abusive, mostly mental. He used to say some pretty horrible things. And even now I have some confidence issues. It was pretty damaging.\"</p> <p>Ellie's foster mother discovered Ellie was in a sexual relationship when she found a used pregnancy test. Ellie says she was then made to go for tests to see if she'd contracted any sexually transmitted infections.</p> <p>\"That's when I found out I had chlamydia,\" she says. \"This was the boy who I thought was the love of my life. It was the love I should have got from my parents.\"</p> <p>Despite what she remembers affectionately as a \"close relationship\" with her foster mother, Ellie says they never sat down and talked about the implications of her being sexually active. \"I felt really awkward. I lost my virginity at 14 and I didn't want to say,\" she explains. \"It was not something that was spoken about.\"</p> <p>It's a sensitive time for any teenager when they start to explore their sexuality. But almost by definition it's harder for young people in care. They are known to be vulnerable to sexual exploitation. For many, the sexual or physical abuse that has resulted in them being taken into care means they start from a different place when they begin to negotiate adult relationships.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the question of who is looking after the sexual health and wellbeing of young people in care is difficult to answer. This is partly because the foster carers with whom they are placed do not have legal parental responsibility, and cannot keep information to themselves if they are concerned the young person may be at risk of serious harm.</p> <p>\"Children coming into fostering families will recognise a level of surveillance about their lives,\" says Diane Heath, membership support consultant at the Fostering Network. Though she says it's right that foster carers must share some disclosures, \"I think that lack of confidentiality can act as an inhibitor.\"</p> <p>It's unlikely that children will feel happy talking about their concerns if they're worried their most private thoughts will become widely known in the team responsible for their care. And though good agencies will offer training in how to handle discussions on sex education and relationships, dealing with the day-to-day reality of a teenager's burgeoning interest in sex is far more complex than just following a manual, says Alan Wood, Midlands director for the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, and also a foster carer offering placements to teenage boys.</p> <p>His approach, he says, is \"fairly frank\".</p> <p>\"We say this is what the law says, this is what's allowed and not allowed. The issue is about making sure the relationship between you and the young person is as positive as it can be, so we try to offer them as much choice as we can. And that means trust is easier. It's being able to create the atmosphere within the home.\"</p> <p>Joanna Adande, an experienced foster carer who offered placements to teenagers and now works at the Fostering Network, acknowledges that some of the conversations she's had have been \"very difficult for me\".</p> <p>When she began fostering, Adande recalls: \"I had to deal with my feelings around young people being sexually active at a very young age, and sometimes being very promiscuous. I had to learn not to use language that was interpreted as rejecting. You often have to go about things in a roundabout way as opposed to reacting from an emotional point of view. You have to be calm ... and professional.\"</p> <p>All children's sexual wellbeing rests on their feelings of self-worth, says Kevin Williams, chief executive of the fostering and adoption charity TACT. \"When children are abused and neglected, that has an impact on their self-esteem and so they are vulnerable because of their early experience. They're looking for stability, reassurance, affection.</p> <p>\"So yes, you need a strategy to look at their sexual health,\" Williams adds. \"But alongside that you need a strategy to build up their self-esteem and confidence.\"</p> <p>A young person who is looked after \"may never have seen a healthy consensual relationship in practice\", points out Lisa Handy, co-ordinator of the Sex Education Forum at NCB (National Children's Bureau).</p> <p>And because they often move frequently, she adds, young people in care may not have had the chance to develop positive long-term relationships with friends. This gap in their experience may mean they don't have the opportunity to develop the perspective, skills and sense of security to stand up for themselves and negotiate what's reasonable and what they want from a sexual relationship.</p> <p>When it comes to crunch-time and a child plucks up the courage to open a sensitive conversation, foster carers can feel very anxious about what kind of guidance they are and aren't allowed to give, says Heath.</p> <p>She says that all services should have an explicit policy on sex and relationships education \"and foster carers must know about their own service's policy on what they can and can't do\".</p> <p>Adande agrees: \"Fostering service providers have to get their act together in the training they provide, and have a clear policy regarding the tension between enabling young people to make choices and protecting them. Often, we're left not knowing what the policy is and doing things from instinct, which isn't the best way.\"</p> <p>Even though there are some professionals who will respect confidentiality \u2013 GPs and other sexual health services \u2013 it may be that some young people would prefer to have the discussion, no matter how fraught with potential embarrassment, with someone who knows them.</p> <p>\"I wish I'd had that conversation about the consequences with my foster mum,\" says Ellie. \"I think it was her job to bring it up. It's going to be an awkward conversation no matter who you have it with, but we had a really close relationship and she could probably have got through to me.\"</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",
  "<p>A world-wide group of editors has raised the alarm about a press freedom crisis in Argentina where the government is planning to break up the country's leading independent media group.</p> <p>The Paris-based Global Editors' Network (GEN) is calling on the world's media to focus attention on a decision by the administration of President Cristina Kirchner to seize control of Grupo Clar\u00edn on 7 December. </p> <p>It is using a controversial media law in order to revoke its licences and sell off its assets. Yet the law itself is currently being challenged in the courts on the grounds that it violates constitutional rights.</p> <p>The Clar\u00edn group publishes Argentina's largest-selling newspaper, Clar\u00edn, which has been a consistently critical voice of the Kirchner government.<br> After a meeting of the GEN board in Buenos Aires this week, its secretary, Alejandro Mir\u00f3 Quesada, said: \"7 December is a deadline day for press freedom. Media should speak with one voice against this intolerable threat to independent journalism. </p> <p>\"The attack on Clar\u00edn is symbolic of the political pressure that media are facing throughout the region.\" </p> <p>The Kirchner move follows a three-year campaign by her government against the Clar\u00edn group, the details of which have been reported previously by the three leading global press freedom watchdogs (<a href=\"http://www.freemedia.at/home/singleview/article/ipi-condemns-argentine-governments-attacks-on-grupo-clarin.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/2011/02/attacks-on-the-press-2010-argentina.php\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/report-argentina,166.html\">here</a>). </p> <p>GEN has also highlighted more than 450 legal and administrative acts of harassment against Clar\u00edn. One key move has been the government's preferential placing of state advertising with certain media companies which, says GEN, \"has effectively bought itself control of media content.\" </p> <p>It is estimated the the Kirchner government now has direct or indirect control of 80% of the Argentine media. </p> <p>As for the media law, it was supposed to strengthen diversity and pluralism by limiting monopoly media ownership - a legitimate goal - but its critics say it has only one intention: to stifle dissent and, in particular, to dismantle the Clar\u00edn group.</p> <p>Even though it remains uncertain whether the Kirchner government will carry out its threat, GEN is organising an international petition and calling on media leaders from the region, and around the world, to protest. </p> <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> GEN was founded in March 2011 in response to concerns about the risks to the future of quality journalism. Its 400 members are drawn from editors and executives in 80 countries. The president is Ricardo Kirschbaum, Clar\u00edn's editor-in-chief, and one of <a href=\"http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/board-members/\">the 24-strong board members</a> is The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger. </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> GEN/<a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/report-argentina,166.html\">Reporters Without Borders</a>/<a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/2011/02/attacks-on-the-press-2010-argentina.php\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>/<a href=\"http://www.freemedia.at/home/singleview/article/ipi-condemns-argentine-governments-attacks-on-grupo-clarin.html\">International Press Institute</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Putting patients first\" has been a goal of successive governments, but actions have so far failed to match up to the rhetoric.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nationalvoices.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Voices</a> believes a key factor in determining how the NHS reforms are ultimately viewed by patients will be whether they lead to greater patient involvement, for example in care planning, deciding treatment options, and managing chronic conditions.</p> <p>This government took a huge gamble when it decided to embark on major changes to the NHS which will only start to take full effect within sight of the next general election. The new <a href=\"http://www.commissioningboard.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">NHS Commissioning Board</a>, established at the beginning of this month, will play a crucial role in delivering those reforms and therefore in their success or failure.</p> <p>Ministers say the \"mandate\" setting out the board's objectives will ensure it \"achieves the things that really matter and make a difference to people\". We believe that will only be so if securing patient involvement is central to future decisions about commissioning health services.</p> <p>There is strong evidence that the full participation of patients in decisions about their care and treatment can lead to improved health outcomes; improved quality \u2013 especially in relation to patient experience \u2013 and more effective and appropriate use of resources.</p> <p>Conversely, the<a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/patients%E2%80%99-preferences-matter\" title=\"\"> \"misdiagnosis\" of patient preferences</a> can have serious consequences. National Voices' members have told this and previous governments that patient involvement is a higher priority for patients than being able to choose between different providers of treatment.</p> <p>The draft mandate contains an extensive \"choice framework\" including, for instance, guarantees that patients can choose who to see for outpatient appointments and diagnostic tests. However, it does not create an equally strong drive towards the implementation of patient involvement, only rhetorical reference to other kinds of patient decisions.</p> <p>National Voices cannot support government proposals for a choice framework until there is an equally powerful focus on people's full involvement in their care and treatment.</p> <p>No one can be against choice. But the choices have to be about what really matters to patients, and patient voices have been consistently misunderstood. \"Choice\" alone does not amount to \"putting patients first\".</p> <p>We now fear there is a real risk that the emphasis on extending a choice of provider will occupy the NHS's attention to the detriment of patient involvement.</p> <p>Current and previous attempts to extend patient involvement have resulted in \"bolt-on\" initiatives such as information prescriptions and the production of online patient decision aids. There are many other such evidence-based interventions that can be used, but they will only be effective where service leaders and staff are committed to a culture of supporting patient decisions.</p> <p>In responding to the draft mandate, National Voices has called for the Commissioning Board to lead a national drive to develop the tools, guidance, incentives and awareness among healthcare commissioners that are needed to ensure much greater patient involvement in the NHS.&#xa0;</p> <p>The board, and local clinical commissioning groups, need to redesign the services they commission, to remove paternalism and establish a culture of patient support.</p> <p>Service providers should be working to strengthen the health literacy, skills and confidence of patients to be as involved as possible in managing their care and treatment, especially in relation to long-term conditions. Likewise they should support family carers, who are the ones most engaged with patients. The skills, behaviours and values of care professionals need building, to move from a \"doing to\", to a \"working with\" culture.</p> <p>Whatever the downside of the tsunami of reforms besetting the NHS, they do create an opportunity to bring about a significant culture change and achieve genuine patient involvement. We can help the policy makers get this right by drawing on insight and expertise from the patient movement.</p> <p><em>Jeremy Taylor is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.nationalvoices.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>National Voices</em></a><em>, a coalition of more than 140 health and social care charities</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>David Cameron will seek to prevent Ed Miliband's \"one nation\" Labour driving him from the common ground of British politics on Wednesday, asserting that his brand of compassionate Conservatism is not just for the strong, but also the best way to help the poor, the weak and the vulnerable.</p> <p>Despite a conference full of tough messages on burglary, welfare and sometimes social issues, the prime minister will insist: \"My mission from the day I became leader was \u2026 to show the Conservative party is for everyone, north or south, black or white, straight or gay.\"</p> <p>In his annual speech to the Conservative party conference, he will tell his party: \"It's not enough to know our ideas are right. We've got to explain why they are compassionate too.\"</p> <p>His aides decline to refer to the political \"centre ground\" arguing that on issues such as welfare, crime and Europe, the common ground is to the right, and in territory long occupied by the Conservatives. He will also refuse to bury the much derided \"big society\" concept in his keynote speech closing the conference season saying his task is \"above all to show Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society\".</p> <p>But on the day after the IMF issued another downgrade of its UK growth forecasts, Cameron will also issue a stark, almost existential, warning to the country, saying unparalleled global forces mean the country is at an hour of reckoning.</p> <p>He will say: \"Unless we act, unless we take difficult decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be the force which it has been in the past. The truth is this we are in a global race today and that means an hour of reckoning for a country like ours \u2013 sink or swim, do or die.\"</p> <p>At the same time, flashes of his trademark optimism will appear, drawing on the revival of the British spirit shown in the Olympic summer.</p> <p>Cameron's aides believe that Miliband's largely insular address to his own party totally failed to address not just the deficit but the scale of competitive challenge facing Britain due to rise of new global powers. He will argue that these forces require tough decisions on spending, welfare, and schools if the strivers working hard are not to feel cheated.</p> <p>The prime minister's aides acknowledge that although Miliband, in personal terms, delivered a strong speech, they estimate he has made two major strategic errors in failing to make tough decisions on the deficit or show a greater willingness to curb the welfare budget.</p> <p>Cameron will say: \"Labour's plans to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and with our future. We're here because they spent too much money and borrowed too much. How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing. I honestly think Labour has not learned a thing.\"</p> <p>George Osborne upped the stakes by claiming a fundamental threat to the free enterprise system now existed, adding to claims made by Cameron that Labour is waging class war.</p> <p>He told a meeting of businessmen in Birmingham: \"Really for the first time in my adult lifetime, up for grabs is the argument about a free enterprise economy.</p> <p>\"That was really resolved I thought at the end of my teenage years when the Berlin Wall fell and all parties and all groups in Britain basically accepted the consensus of the free market economy.</p> <p>\"I would say you just see signs of that being contested, contested because of what's happened in the banking crash, and people are starting to say it's OK for the state to take 50% of the national income, it's OK for the state to tax people 50% of their income, it's actually wrong to challenge vested interests in our education and welfare system.\"</p> <p>In an implicit acknowledgement that the electorate remains confused about his core values, Cameron will reveal more than he has ever done before about his personal background.</p> <p>Cameron will not present himself as a hard luck story, but the son of a man that suffered disability, stigma, loneliness and a broken family. Cameron's father Ian died two years ago aged 77 and had been born with both legs deformed, and endured repeated operations in an attempt to straighten them. \"Because disability in the thirties was such a stigma, he was an only child and probably a lonely child,\" Cameron will say.</p> <p>Challenging those who see the Conservatives as the party of snobs and the rich, he will say: \"There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country\".</p> <p>Cameron found himself under growing pressure over his plans to cut the welfare budget, with Liberal Democrat grassroots bodies demanding that Nick Clegg does not sign up to such measures. They are furious that their plan to raise taxes through a \"mansion tax\" has been thrown out by the chancellor. There is suspicion in Lib Dem circles that Clegg has in broad terms agreed to this level of welfare cuts, something his officials hotly deny.</p> <p>Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury select committee, said at a fringe event: \"The reason we have a low interest rate is because the economy is absolutely screwed.\" But Cameron rejected a change: \"It's not Plan B that we need, what we are doing is making sure that every part of Plan A is firing on all cylinders.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Taliban's attempt to kill a 14-year-old girl, famous for speaking out against the Islamic militants and their attacks on girls' education, has triggered a wave of national revulsion in Pakistan .</p> <p>Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head and neck while she sat with classmates on a school bus as it prepared to drive students home after morning classes in Mingora, a city in the Swat valley, where the army mounted major operations in 2009 to crush a Taliban insurgency.</p> <p>She was taken to hospital before being whisked in a military helicopter to an intensive care ward in Peshawar.</p> <p>Police said a bearded man approached the bus and asked which of the girls was Malala.

It was a popular place for Pakistani tourists before the Taliban began a takeover of the area, closing girls' schools, forcing men to grow beards and beheading their opponents.</p> <p>At a time when even Pakistani politicians appeared to be appeasing the Taliban, Yousafzai spoke out against the militants. She wrote a blog for the BBC's Urdu service website under the pseudonym Gul Makai (\"cornflower\") about the chaos of the time, including the fears of her classmates that their educations would be abruptly stopped.</p> <p>Her efforts were recognised by the then prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, who awarded her the country's first National Peace Award and a reward of \u00a33,300 after she missed out on winning the International Children's Peace Prize for which she was nominated in 2011.</p> <p>Recently she had spoken of her desire to set up her own political party and a vocational institute for marginalised girls in her area.</p> <p>The attack led alarmed locals to raise doubts about government claims that the military has completely dismantled the militants' operation in Swat.</p> <p>\"An attack on Malala in a highly secured area has sent a shiver down the spine of Swati people,\" said Fazal Maula Zahid, a member of Swat Qaumi Jirga, a local anti-Taliban group working for peace in the region. \"We are holding urgent meeting of our jirga [tribal assembly] to chalk out a future strategy. We demand of the government to arrest the attackers or the confidence of the people in the government will greatly be shaken.\"</p> <p>Although Pakistanis have grown used to the horrors of Taliban bombings and attacks around the country, some media figures said the attempt on Yousafzai's life could be a watershed.</p> <p>Murtaza Salangi, the director of Pakistan Radio, said people were standing up to be counted as if this was their own daughter.</p> <p>\"I think it is a watershed moment because the outpouring of sympathy and support for this young girl is just unprecedented. She could be a rallying poster for people who think that extremism and terrorism is the biggest challenge, even an existential challenge, for this country.\"</p> <p>He said the mood of revulsion extended beyond just the \"educated elite\", saying the switchboard at Radio Pakistan's Peshawar studio had \"lit up like Christmas lights\" after phone lines were opened for people across the country to contact a phone-in programme.</p> <p>Rana Jawad, Islamabad bureau chief of Geo, the country's biggest news channel, compared footage played throughout the day of the unconscious Malala being loaded on to a helicopter to a 2009 clip showing a woman in Swat being beaten by the Taliban, which was constantly replayed and horrified the country.</p> <p>\"The reason the military was successful in its campaign against the Taliban in 2009 is that the whole nation was supporting them after they watched a young girl being beaten by a handful of militants,\" he said. \"Today we have seen the reaction of the people is one of outrage, revulsion and a sense of shame at what has happened to Pakistan.\"</p> <p>Although he noted none of the country's religious conservative parties have yet condemned the attack, he said the Malala incident could \"help the nation gel together in dismissing this mindset which attacked an innocent, harmless girl\".</p> <p>The country's supreme court on Tuesday ordered an investigation into the alleged barter of seven girls to settle a blood feud in a remote district.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://nuwen.net/culture.html\" title=\"\">The Culture</a>, the post-scarcity, hedonistic, Machiavellian, libertarian, ass-kicking science fiction society created by Iain M Banks, is 25 years old. Over eight novels and one short story collection, Banks has created one of the most enduring and endearing visions of the future, and the publication of the ninth Culture novel, <em>The Hydrogen Sonata</em>, confirms his pre-eminence in the field. That said, the success of the Culture novels is rather surprising. Conventionally, a novel is driven by threat, and the Culture \u2013 infinitely capable, technologically miraculous, polymorphously perverse \u2013 seems capable of fending off each and every threat that comes its way. <em>Consider Phlebas</em>, the first in the series, established the moral paradox that fuels the whole series. How far will an ultra-liberal society go to defend its liberties? While most of the Culture happily switches genders and ingests safe drugs, the Minds \u2013 artificial intelligences that run the show \u2013 secretly ensure this utopia through the pleasingly euphemistic \"Special Circumstances\" division. In part, they genuinely believe in their mission. In part, it just staves off the boredom of being the galaxy's apex predator.</p> <p>Looking back over all the books, it becomes clear that the dual threat to the Culture is not just anomie, but religion. <em>Consider Phlebas</em> was set during the Culture-Idiran war, where the Idirans refused to renounce their religion and set themselves on a self-destruct course against the Culture. In <em>Excession</em>, the Minds confronted a perfect black sphere that was older than the universe and refused to conform to their ideas of reality; a god to the godless. <em>Look to Windward</em> developed ideas that had been in the books from the start: some societies eventually \"Sublime\" and leave this metaphorically sublunary sphere; this particular novel involved a society which had partially Sublimed, caught between the ineffable and the actual. <em>Matter</em> was set on an artificial planet, shaped like a series of concentric spheres, at the centre of which was a \"god\". <em>Surface Detail</em> extended the notion of immortality through back-ups of the self: some societies, to the Culture's pursed annoyance, were condemning people to virtual hells.</p> <p>In the new book, the Gzilt civilisation is preparing to Sublime. They were almost a founding member of the Culture, but declined to join at the eleventh hour; in part, their decision was founded on the fact that of all species in the universe, theirs was the only one whose religious texts had been proven to be completely and utterly true. As other races come to bid farewell to the Gzilt, one delegate, bearing a message, is obliterated. That's enough for the Minds to take an interest in what the unfortunate individual was going to reveal.</p> <p>Tracking down why a society about to leave this reality would commit a murder leads the Minds to a Gzilt woman called Vyr Cossont, who is spending the remaining days of her society playing the musical piece which gives the book its title (one character caustically says that the piece should ideally be played in a vacuum so that no one can hear it; another calls it \"as a challenge without peer. As music, without merit\"). She is exceptional only in that she once met the oldest living member of the Culture, a man who has been hiding from their benevolent overlords for so long that he is almost a myth. He might remember what the Gzilt are so keen to cover up, and given that he has written his memories on every part of his anatomy, they need to find not just him but every part of him.</p> <p>The sheer ebullience of imagination counteracts the Culture's inherent lassitude, and here Banks suggests, more than in the other books, that there is something wanting about the Culture. Why don't they Sublime, for example? The fact that the Minds in this book \u2013 always wittily named and more interesting than the humanoids \u2013 fancy themselves as a modern-day equivalent of the \"Interesting Times Gang\" that dealt with the Excession reinforces the sense that utopia can be very boring. The Culture's obsession with the Sublime is done particularly well; the Mind which, uniquely, Sublimed and then came back is a melancholic still point in the hectic action. I hope the next book deals with the \"smatter\" Banks introduced in <em>Surface Detail</em>: ''self-replicating entities [that] ran out of control somewhere and started trying to turn the totality of the galaxy's matter into nothing but copies of themselves\". It is the dark mirror of the Culture's aggressive moral superiority. The Culture is trapped between two unilateral conformities; transcendence and materialism.</p> <p>Banks can riff like no other science-fiction writer. The description of the party the Gzilt are having as a prelude to Subliming is gloriously baroque and silly; the anxieties of the officials display a keen satire and a keener anger. The protagonists of the Culture novels have almost always been those on the fringe of the Culture itself, and there is a moral empathy with the refuseniks and the renegades that subtly undermines the Culture's disavowed aggrandising ambitions. If there is an arc for the whole series, it is that trouble in paradise comes from paradise, not from a snake conveniently dropped in to cause trouble.</p> <p>For all that the books are epic in scope and derangingly replete in detail, <em>The Hydrogen Sonata</em> reiterates a key theme: that personal fulfilment, in whatever form that takes, is rare and to be treasured. Vyr Cossont's commitment to playing an almost unplayable piece of music is contrasted with the Mind who can do it immediately, flawlessly and without effort. Banks is always on the side of those trying rather than those succeeding, and that, ironically, is his great success.</p> <p>\u2022 Stuart Kelly's <em>The Book of Lost Books</em> is published by Polygon.</p>",

  "<p>Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 officer, have been cited as key defendants in court documents that describe in detail abuse meted out to Libyan dissidents and their families after being abducted and handed to Muammar Gaddafi's secret police with the help of British intelligence.</p> <p>The documents accuse Straw of misleading MPs about Britain's role in the rendition of two leading dissidents \u2013 Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi \u2013 and say MI6 must have known they risked being tortured. They say British intelligence officers provided Libyan interrogators with questions to ask their captives and themselves flew to Tripoli to interview the detainees in jail.</p> <p>They recount how Belhaj was chained, hooded, and beaten; his pregnant wife, Fatima Bouchar, punched and bound; how Saadi was repeatedly assaulted; his wife, Ait Baaziz, hooded and ill-treated; and their children traumatised, as they were abducted and jailed in Libya following tip-offs by MI6 and the CIA in 2004.</p> <p>Belhaj and Saadi were leading members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which opposed Gaddafi. Belhaj became head of the Tripoli Brigade during last year's revolution and is a leading Libyan political figure. They are suing Straw, Allen, MI6, MI5, the Foreign Office, the Home Office, and the attorney general, for damages for unlawful detention, conspiracy to injure, negligence, and abuse of public office. It is believed to be the first time such action has been taken against a former British foreign secretary.</p> <p>The court documents, served by the law firm Leigh Day and the legal charity and human rights group, Reprieve, allege:</p> <p>\u2022 MI6 alerted Libyan intelligence to the whereabouts of Belhaj and his family. They were held in Malaysia and Thailand and flown to Libya in a CIA plane.</p> <p>\u2022 The CIA and MI6 co-operated in the rendition of Saadi and his family from Hong Kong to Libya via Thailand.</p> <p>\u2022 Straw and his co-defendants knew that torture was endemic in Gaddafi's Libya.</p> <p>\u2022 British intelligence officers sent detailed questions to the Libyan authorities to be used in Belhaj and Saadi's interrogations.</p> <p>\u2022 Straw did not tell the truth when he told the Commons foreign affairs committee in 2005 that Britain was not involved in any rendition operations.</p> <p>\u2022 Evidence by Sir John Scarlett, the head of MI6, to the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) in 2006 that his agency did not assist in any rendition to countries other than the US or the detainee's country of origin was incorrect and misleading. Bouchar is Moroccan, and Baaziz is Algerian, and neither had been to Libya before their abduction.</p> <p>\u2022 Evidence by an MI5 witness to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission about the renditions was untrue and misleading.</p> <p>\u2022 According to the US flight plan rendering Belhaj and his wife to Libya, the plane would refuel at the American base on the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia. If it had done so it would contradict assurances made to MPs by the former foreign secretary David Miliband. Referring to the coalition government's plans for secret courts, Khadidja al-Saadi, who was 12 when she was abducted, said: \"I tried writing to Ken Clarke [former justice secretary] about my case \u2013 I told him that having a secret court judge my kidnap was the kind of thing Gaddafi would have done.\"</p> <p>Her father said: \"After my rendition I spent years in Gaddafi's jails, and a secret 'court' sentenced me to death. Even now, after everything that happened, I hope and pray British justice will serve me better than this. My family has asked the government to apologise, and the government has refused.\"</p> <p>Cori Crider, Reprieve's legal director, said: \"The public have every right to know just how high the plot to kidnap these families went. Did it stop at Allen and Straw? Or did Tony Blair know what was going on in a torture chamber down the road while he hugged Gaddafi in a tent? You won't find the answer in Straw's book [Last Man Standing].\"</p> <p>If the justice and security \"secret courts\" bill, passes \"we will never know\", Crider added.</p> <p>The abductions took place after the Blair government embraced Gaddafi following the Libyan leader's promise in 2003 to abandon nuclear weapons. Allen developed close relations with Gaddafi's intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, documents unearthed in Tripoli show.</p> <p>Whitehall sources say that in their dealings with Gaddafi MI6 was carrying out \"ministerially authorised government policy\" and were given assurances by the Libyans that the detainees would not be tortured. The Guardian has asked Straw about the renditions. He has said he cannot comment because of a police investigation into the affair.</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p><strong>18 March 2004:</strong> \"Most importantly, I congratulate you on the safe arrival of [Behaj] This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years. I am so glad.\" \u2013 <strong>Sir Mark Allen, MI6's former head of counter-terrorism, to Moussa Koussa, Gaddafi's intelligence chief, from documents found in Tripoli in September 2011</strong></p> <p><strong>13 December 2005:</strong> \"Unless we all start to believe in conspiracy theories and that the officials are lying, that I am lying, that behind this there is some kind of secret state which is in league with some dark forces in the United States&#xa0;\u2026There is simply no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition full stop, because we never have been.\" \u2013 <strong>Jack Straw to the Commons foreign affairs committee</strong></p> <p><strong>12 January 2012:</strong> \"The allegations raised in the two specific cases concerning the alleged rendition of named individuals to Libya and the alleged ill-treatment of them in Libya are so serious that it is in the public interest for them to be investigated now\" \u2013 <strong>the Metropolitan police</strong></p>"
