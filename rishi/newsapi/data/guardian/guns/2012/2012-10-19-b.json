  "<p>Ashley Cole has been punished by the Football Association with a \u00a390,000 fine, after defending fellow footballer John Terry. Cleared of racism in a court of law, Terry was nevertheless censured by the FA. Perhaps it is because the FA is hotter on white privilege than most of us. In the world of critical theory, race theorists have embraced the idea of white privilege. It suggests white people are reluctant to acknowledge the advantages unfairly conferred simply by their pale skin, even when they can&#xa0;plainly see dark skin does confer unfair disadvantage. It's a useful intellectual model, as it describes the reality of white dominance. In that respect, it's similar to the feminist theory of patriarchy, which describes the reality of male dominance.</p> <p>Both theories, however, are limited in the extent to which they can be usefully applied. Just as individual men are not likely to say, \"I&#xa0;won't take that university place, got&#xa0;to do my bit to defeat patriarchy,\" individual whites are unlikely to say, \"I&#xa0;won't take that promotion, got to make a stand against&#xa0;white privilege.\"</p> <p>This is partly because people tend to be selfish, and partly because they tend not to be able to choose who takes their university place or promotion instead. Historical models can be more helpful than theoretical ones: white privilege, for example, can be understood perfectly well as Western privilege. Temperate climates, over time, assisted their populations in ushering in the agricultural and industrial revolutions. They also, over time, lightened the skins&#xa0;of those populations, who were sadly not advanced enough to see that circumstances, not appearance, explained the advances. Many still can't.&#xa0;They're racists. Likewise, male&#xa0;privilege can be&#xa0;understood as non-childbearing privilege.</p> <p>The advantage of these approaches is&#xa0;in offering practical solutions. The worldwide spread of&#xa0;technological progress will afford opportunity to all ethnicities. Lessening the emphasis on maternal exclusivity in child-rearing will level the playing field between the sexes. But haranguing men about their gender, or whites about their skin colour, tends only to make the very people that need to engage with the problem feel embattled.</p>",

But after a Keith Jarrett-like childhood in which he played concerts and was regarded as a prodigy, Law became fascinated by improvisation and jazz, and by the late 1980s he was playing with the likes of saxophonist Evan Parker and South African drummer Louis Moholo. In the next decade, Law operated in parallel worlds, with a vibrant post-Ornette jazz group including saxophonist Jon Lloyd, and in his own quirky variations on classical, baroque and medieval music. Latterly, Law has moved closer to a more lyrical and rhythmic piano-trio agenda.

  "<p><strong>My seven-year-old daughter has always been a good eater and enjoyed&#xa0;her food but I am worried that she is developing an unhealthy relationship with it. I give her healthy meals and plenty of treats but it doesn't seem enough. She always wants more. I know she has been taking biscuits from the kitchen, eating them in her room and hiding the wrappers under her bed. If I ask her if she has taken the biscuits, she always denies it. </strong></p> <p><strong>Her father \u2013 from whom I am separated \u2013 has long struggled with his weight. He is often on strict diets yet lets our daughter eat whatever she likes when she is with him. I worry that I have been too strict \u2013 I restrict her to one or two biscuits rather than leave her with the whole packet, so maybe she hasn't learned when to stop. </strong></p> <p><strong>She isn't overweight but my mother recently said that she&#xa0;will have to watch herself because she could easily become so. I don't want my daughter to associate eating with&#xa0;guilt and to eat in secret. <em>M,&#xa0;via&#xa0;email</em></strong></p> <p>The first thing to do is take her to a GP to make sure there is no underlying health problem. I don't expect there is, but it's something to mention. Naturally, you will need to couch things diplomatically and I might be tempted to talk to the GP alone first, to see if they even think it's necessary to get your daughter in.</p> <p>You say she's not overweight, so there really isn't a problem yet (I'm guessing that, like 90% of parental worries, it's not about what is happening but fear of what will happen if things continue unchecked).</p> <p>It sounds as if she eats healthily and has treats in moderation. What about exercise? If your daughter leads a healthy lifestyle then a few biscuits are not going to hurt her. I do wonder if this is more about you, and your husband. Are you worried she's going to become overweight like him? Is this a battle more with the way he parents than your daughter's eating habits? Does she remind you of him and does she sense that? Has she started eating secretly since you split up? Have you spoken to your husband about it and asked him to have healthy snacks in the house? I'm sorry if this seems like a lot of questions when you want answers but these are important things to think&#xa0;about.</p> <p>The way to give your child an unhealthy relationship with food is to layer food with emotion and focus too much on it. If you find biscuits have gone, don't ask her about them. The fact that she is lying to you suggests she feels ashamed. In fact, if you are worried about this, try keeping biscuits in the house only occasionally, if at all.</p> <p>I'd also like you to shift the focus of your relationship with your daughter away from food. Food is a big part of everyday life and it should not be imbued with battle and shame. Have you tried cooking or baking with her? This is a great way to learn about nutrition, and you can control the ingredients. It's also useful mother-child time, which might be helpful here. Do you trust your daughter in other ways? If she feels her choices are not listened to or respected, then she won't trust herself, either.</p> <p>Buy her The Silver Spoon for Children: Favourite Italian Recipes by <a href=\"http://www.amandagrant.com\" title=\"\">Amanda Grant</a>, \u00a312.95, and let her choose what to make \u2013 say one meal a week. Put her in control. Unlike some cookery books aimed at children, this one teaches you how to make proper food, rather than stuff in the shape of smiley&#xa0;faces.</p> <p>We are born with excellent appetite control but it is conditioned out of some of us. I totally appreciate that you don't want your daughter to have unhealthy eating habits or become obese. But my hunch is that something else is going on here.</p> <p>If your daughter is genuinely hungry, I'd look at what you're making. Does it have the right balance of good fats/proteins/carbohydrates? A carb-heavy meal, especially if it's refined carbohydrates, may make her feel full quickly but then very hungry again a short while later.</p> <p>Ultimately, try to relax, give your daughter plenty of time to talk to you in case something is bothering her and reassure her that she is lovely, safe and&#xa0;secure.</p> <h2>Your problems solved<br></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

  "<p>At school in the 70s it was vital, for the purpose of not getting your face bashed in behind the bike sheds, that your parents had, a) a good car, b) a house in the proper part of town, and c) jobs from the approved list. I was down on points for all three.</p> <p>Our vehicle was a rusty Renault 4 van, which attracted attention to itself with loud whining and farting noises when I was dropped off in the morning, our small house was on the cusp of nowhere and my parents' jobs were an unspeakable embarrassment. My father, who had once been a Dominican friar, was now a schoolmaster \u2013 dangerous enough. But my mother was, God help me, a sex therapist.</p> <p>The 70s were a time before therapy became the must-have fashion accessory it is today, and if this mystical-sounding profession had been heard of by my desk-slamming peers \u2013 which it hadn't \u2013 it would not have been granted their imprimatur.</p> <p>Indeed, when we had to write down our parents' occupations in Mr Price's civics lesson, I omitted the radioactive word \"sex\" from my mum's job title out of an instinct for self-preservation. It did me no good because Bob McGrotty shouted out from behind me, \"Oi! Cutler's mum's the rapist. Cutler's mum's the rapist.\"</p> <p>I knew from experience that playground associates were also capable of acts of hideous betrayal. When poor little Tony Smith whispered to some smiler with the knife that he fancied Denise Pumphrey, he found his indiscretion sprayed in two-foot high green capitals all over the remedial hut next morning. So I was guarded about exactly what I told exactly whom.</p> <p>Close friends were a different matter. If they asked what my mum did for a living, I told them. Liking to regard themselves as sophisticated boys of the world, they thought it all rather exciting. Mild discombobulation was occasionally voiced about the question of just how my dad, who in his former vocation had taken a vow of chastity, had ended up with a wife who listened all day to people talking about their penises. But as my amiable mother administered smiles and cucumber sandwiches, my school chums noted that she appeared not at all sex therapist-like but quite ordinary and found themselves able to make allowances for her daytime calling.</p> <p>I wondered, though, what I ought to tell girlfriends. Fired up with youthful carnality in the early days of a romantic relationship, it seemed vital to appear assured, witty and sophisticated, rather than merely lust-crazed. Would telling a girl, \"My mum's a sex therapist\" add to my seductive allure or just make me sound like the callow and boastful offspring of a species of female sex-creep? I bit the bullet and announced to Evelina what it was that my mother did at the office. She took it in her stride like the classy girl she was and things went swimmingly thereafter. For a bit anyway. In the end the unbeatable glamour of Ray Melly's red Triumph sucked her clear of my ambit.</p> <p>A handful of sweethearts down the line, the girl who became my wife never batted an eye when she learned what my mother did and we have been happily married for donkey's years, with hardly a saucer thrown. By the way, and for the record, I have never sought, nor needed to seek, any technical advice from my mum. Apart from the usual motherly stuff about the proper way to treat a girlfriend, she has never offered me guidance, practical, emotional or otherwise about her area of expertise, and for this I remain grateful.</p> <p>While my wife didn't care what my mother did to earn a crust, it was a different story with my father-in-law. When he learned that his daughter was to marry the son of a sex therapist, he showed his displeasure by having a heart attack. Not then and there: he saved it up for the evening before our wedding, for maximum effect. He pulled through in the end, seeming to accommodate himself to the idea of me \u2013 and my mum \u2013 as time went by.</p> <p>My mother was always professionally discreet and spoke to me about her work only in the vaguest generalities. I recall that she did once describe something called restless genital syndrome, a condition that causes spontaneous, uncontrollable and persistent genital arousal, unconnected to any feelings of sexual desire.</p> <p>This arousal can be intense and, though orgasm may provide relief, the symptoms are wont to return suddenly, unpredictably and with a vengeance. In women, this causes wave after wave of spontaneous orgasms to erupt just as they are doing a bit of shopping. In men, it can result in impromptu ejaculation at the bar, petrol pump or job interview. Bus and train rides become not only inconvenient but also hazardous, as vibrations aggravate the syndrome.</p> <p>But, apart from the occasional description of odd sexual maladies, I was never privy to the specifics of the people involved in my mother's therapy sessions. I know that the commonest sex problem she encountered was impotence \u2013 what is today politely called erectile dysfunction, or, rudely, ascension deficit disorder. But this, she maintained, was almost always more to do with the couple's relationship than with the gentleman's plumbing. Apart from clear medical causes, such as very poor cardiovascular health or longstanding diabetes, sex problems were likely to arise, she said, between the ears rather than between the legs.</p> <p>In the 80s, my parents moved to Berkshire, where my mother went into private practice on her own. When I once asked about the kind of guidance she gave her customers, she explained that she almost never did, preferring instead to allow them to talk about what was bothering them.</p> <p>In therapy it often became clear that couples spoke little to each other in daily life, not only about sex but about anything, and, in extreme cases, communicated exclusively through terse notes taped to the fridge or pinned to the shed door. Men failed to understand what women wanted and women failed to tell them, and vice versa. So, she would sit in her consulting rooms, gently nudging ordinarily non-speaking life partners this way and that, while they unravelled the long threads of their distress by just talking and listening, sometimes for the first time. In most cases, said my mum, this was like unstopping a bottle of tribulation; and helping her clients to let it all out commonly proved a solution to the physical problem.</p> <p>Of course, the talking cure was not her idea. Freud had begun doing it at the end of the previous century and by the 1970s varying flavours of psychotherapy had become popular around the globe.</p> <p>The world-renowned sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, who claimed to have observed more than 10,000 orgasms in the course of their studies in the late 1950s, 60s and 70s, had developed methods for treating premature ejaculation, impotence and female frigidity (now called hypoactive sexual desire disorder), using two-week talking sessions. They claimed a success rate of about 80%, which sounds almost unbelievably high. Though my mother had fewer clients, she tended to spend longer with them.</p> <p>Working from consulting rooms under the thatch of her village home beside the river, she would begin her days, like anyone, with a bit of breakfast. The first caller might arrive at 9am and she would then be opening and closing the door all day to people with problems of every stripe. By this time, my siblings and I had left home and only my father remained.</p> <p>Being a retired gentleman with elbow patches and a tired look, he would make himself scarce, retreating into the kitchen or study, or going to the London Library on the grounds that he had to return a book, possibly on the subject of metaphor or international jurisprudence. He still does this whenever my mother is conducting a couple of days of sex therapy with people, which she still occasionally does, even though she is now in her 80s. I guess her rheumy eyes are today taken by premature ejaculators and the frigid alike as a sign of sagacity, which they may well be.</p> <p>Since her \"official\" retirement, my mum has earned enough at the therapy racket to fund world cruises aplenty, though on the boat she is liable to keep quiet about her profession for fear that the other old dears will all request advice over their poached sole.</p> <p>Her straightforwardness on the topics of sex and what can go wrong with the sexual psyche led me as a boy to view the subject first as intellectually interesting and, second, as perfectly normal, in all its incredible variety. As a consequence, my own son has been brought up in an unembarrassed household where sex questions have always been answered in plain words, and often with a laugh, for if sex is not a funny subject then what is?</p> <p>Whether it was my mother's odd job that led to my becoming a writer for whom sexology is a big theme, I can't say. But my own attitude to sex is this: I'm all for it.</p> <p><em>Tom Cutler's book Slap &amp; Tickle: The Unusual History of Sex and the People who Do It is published by Constable at \u00a312.99.

  "<p>The form looks much like any other official document. There are tick boxes, spaces for signatures, bullet points. Squint and it could be a passport application or one for road tax renewal. When you read it properly, it's obvious that this is something else altogether. The title at the top \u2013 Allow Natural Death order \u2013 makes it abundantly clear.</p> <p>Rather than planning for life, the form outlines death \u2013 if such a thing is possible. And, as far as I can tell, the title is a more palatable way of saying do not resuscitate. It doesn't sound quite as callous, but the subtext is the same: in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest, no attempt at cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be made.</p> <p>For someone as poorly as my father, it's an important thing to establish. So last time I was in Cornwall, my youngest sister and I helped one of my dad's nurses to fill in such a form. The nurse had suggested it when we turned up one day to visit. Perhaps it was the right time, she said gently. We should think about these things.</p> <p>So we arranged to see her a few days later for a \"best interests meeting\". Family members who weren't attending were consulted by phone. As nobody holds a welfare power of attorney for my father \u2013 the one I hold jointly with my younger sister relates just to finances \u2013 decisions about his end-of-life care aren't in the hands of one person. Rather, it's a discussion between those looking after him and his family.</p> <p>But it's not as if there was any disagreement. Everyone involved with Dad agrees that in the event of a cardiac arrest, he shouldn't be resuscitated. His body is so frail and his mind so fractured, it couldn't be conceived as a kindness.</p> <p>The meeting was straightforward, perfunctory even. The woman leading it was kind and thorough, while the bustle of the care home went on in the background: phones ringing, doors slamming, the waft of dinner. In some ways it was hard to believe we were discussing the future event of Dad's death so calmly. But that's the thing about someone you love developing dementia \u2013 you accept things that would have seemed impossibly painful in the abstract.</p> <p>My sister and I had to talk about Dad's mental capacity, or lack thereof, to confirm that he himself can't understand the relevance of such a decision. Then we had to discuss with the nurse the pros and cons of the options.</p> <p>While there is no ambiguity relating to CPR, the possibility of what to do if Dad develops a chest infection is more of a grey area. Pneumonia is such a common way for the infirm to die but, as the nurse said, if Dad could have a straightforward course of antibiotics and retain his present standard of life, it would be worth treating him.</p> <p>After talking it through, the nurse wrote that in such an eventuality there should be a discussion at the time with the home staff, family and his doctors. Sometimes it pays to enshrine what's sensible.</p> <p>So that was it: two forms completed, filed away for another day. A day I hope is a long, long way&#xa0;off. My sister and I went&#xa0;straight to visit Dad in the residents' sitting room. \"My babies!\" he said, in lieu of our names, as we approached, face lit up. We kissed him and sat down, grateful afresh for the father we've got now, different as he is to the man we once knew.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Rebecca on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccahelenley\" title=\"\"><em>@rebeccahelenley</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The bond between two sisters is becoming a bit of a greeting cards cliche. There's never been that sort of card for the close bond that you and I share. So I'm writing you this letter instead. Since you've become a counsellor you've talked a lot about endings. How people struggle when one chapter closes. Of course, you were referring to death but, as I always do, I brought it back to me. Your inevitable departure is something that's filled me with dread. As you move on to married life, I won't have you there to talk about my daily gripes.</p> <p>Your success is something I boast about because you seldom do.

  "<p>As a child, when Jemima Dury visited her father's flat in what he called <a href=\"http://ianduryauthor.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/doughnuts-and-coffee-at-catshit-mansions/\" title=\"\">Catshit Mansions</a>, her ambition was to be her dad's minder. She would tidy up his records as Ian Dury, the charismatic, unpredictable singer of Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll, held court, plied his wit and wordplay on a rabble of Blockhead bandmates, hangers on and south London hoods.</p> <p>\"I wanted to be a roadie or a minder, somebody he was really reliant on,\" says Jemima, the eldest of Dury's four children. \"When I was quite young, I would try to carry a bag or open doors. I was very conscious that he liked people to help him. That became a source of approval.\"</p> <p>Dury invented a word for Jemima's slightly anxious ministrations: she was trying to \"daughterise\" him. Now, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/27/guardianobituaries.robindenselow\" title=\"\">12 years after his death from cancer aged 57</a>, Jemima is still trying to add order to his chaotic affairs by editing a book of his brilliant lyrics.</p> <p>We expect rock star dads to be temperamental, absent and with a tendency to lavish their children with inappropriate gifts. Dury did all this. But this gregarious and sometimes vicious man who was paralysed in one leg and arm by childhood polio, also inspired great love and loyalty from those around him, not least Jemima.</p> <p>Her earliest memories of her dad are of him and her mum, Betty, living a bohemian existence in a rambling vicarage near Aylesbury \u2013 they had graduated together from the Royal College of Art. Dury started a band, Kilburn and the High Roads, and \"lots of long-haired, slightly scruffy people\" would drop round to rehearse. Then, when Jemima was four, Dury left his wife, daughter and son, Baxter, to dedicate his life to a career in music.</p> <p>Suddenly, life was impoverished. \"Mum was struggling big time. A lot of people are very critical of Dad for that period because he really did bugger off and leave us in a bad way,\" says Jemima. It was more than four years before Dury could give much in the way of financial assistance to his family when he belatedly found fame, aged 35, with his acclaimed debut album, New Boots and Panties!! in 1977.</p> <p>By then, he was living in Catshit Mansions, overlooking the Oval cricket ground in south London, with his new girlfriend, Denise Roudette, who was a teenager when they met. Jemima only saw him \"perhaps every couple of months\" but found his flat a fantastic place. When they visited, she and Baxter were looked after by assorted dodgy geezers including the Sulphate Strangler, a former roadie and drug addict. \"It was like having the most mental nanny in the world,\" says Jemima.</p> <p>It helped that Betty was so generous over her husband's departure. \"She was never resentful towards him even though she must have had a pretty dark time. I really think she believed in him, to let him go and do that. She knew he was meant to do what he went&#xa0;to do.\"</p> <p>Ian Dury's sudden fame brought financial security but more problems. When <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WGVgfjnLqc\" title=\"\">Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick</a> reached No 1 in 1978, Jemima and Baxter would get whacked by pupils at school. Respite came in the holidays, when they joined their dad on tour. Jemima remembers watching television with Baxter in a hotel in Switzerland while Dury led a wild party in the adjoining suite. After a while, Dury opened the connecting door, \"got into bed and held our hands and sobbed and sobbed and sobbed, and then sat for an hour making up filthy jokes and rhymes. We talked about all the words we could think of for poo, wee and willy. It was hilarious and a really significant moment. He was sort of saying, 'No, you guys are so much more important than all that.'\"</p> <p>She wishes there had been more of those times. \"There weren't enough of those moments,\" she says. \"I just wanted him to be normal a lot of the time. 'Be my normal bloody dad will you? I would rather you helped me do my homework than took me on tour again.' There was a bit of that disgruntlement from me. It was a pretty basic emotional need.\"</p> <p>At times, Dury put his career above the children, promising but failing to turn up for Jemima's lead role in The Nutcracker, her first dance show. She blanked him for \"what felt like two years but was probably a day\" afterwards. On other occasions, his wit turned nasty. Baxter has described his father as \"a Polaris missile\" in his ability to seek out weakness and destroy people with verbal aggression.</p> <p>\"He knew that people wouldn't attack him because they would be accused of knocking down a disabled man,\" says Jemima. \"When he was angry it was pretty nasty. Control is a big part of it. He learned very, very early on how to find a weakness in somebody and really stick the needle&#xa0;in. It was a way of getting back at the world.\"</p> <p>Before polio struck, Dury was a precocious Little Lord Fauntleroy figure, according to his biographer, Will Birch, riding in the Rolls-Royce his working-class father chauffeured, and indulged by his educated mother.Both parents doted on him. \"The very young years, when he was getting his own way, didn't help,\" thinks Jemima. \"Then he got polio, then he was dealing with life as a disabled kid, then he was at Chailey [Heritage craft school, then a notoriously tough institution for pupils with disabilities] and he got bullied, but he learned how to bully.\"</p> <p>When his \u2013 often drink-fuelled \u2013 rages subsided, \"there wasn't much apologising\" says Jemima, \"but he won you over with wit and charm, and being a lovely guy.\"</p> <p>Jemima and her mother both got on well with Dury's then girlfriend Denise, \"the most beautiful, stylish, incredibly vibrant person you could meet\" says Jemima, but after that relationship ended, \"There was a terrible patch when faces just came and went \u2013 you didn't learn anybody's name. It was just constant new girls he'd met a week before at a gig.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, she became friends with a surprising number. \"They weren't that much older than me,\" she says, laughing. \"A lot of womanisers have that ability to stay sweet with people. Not always, he lost a few along the way, but a surprising number are still close family friends.\"</p> <p>Dury never cared much for money \u2013 Jemima remembers loose change was thrown around his flat and her dad would pick up coins to buy a pint of milk \u2013 but with success he assiduously provided for his family, buying Betty and the children a home in Tring, Hertfordshire, paying for Jemima's theatre school and, later, buying his mother a flat in Hampstead.</p> <p>Jemima fulfilled her childhood dream: when she was old enough to drive, she moved into her dad's flat and became his chauffeur-cum-minder, wearing her grandad's chauffeur cap and driving Dury around in a big green Ford Granada. She slept on the sofa because the Sulphate Strangler also lived in the flat. \"It was very funny but quite crackers. Dad would have a conversation with you at 3am. Even when I was at college and had an exam the next day, he'd say, 'Jemima, Jemima, you've got to listen to this tune, it's brilliant!'\" she says. \"I would be the person who had to scoop him up and drag him home once he'd got pissed and fallen over. There was a lot of bailing him out.\"</p> <p>It sounds as if she was a bit like Saffy, the strait-laced daughter trying to rein in her out-of-control mother Edina, in Absolutely Fabulous. \"I think I am Saffy,\" she laughs. \"If you've grown up with a crazy parent, you want things to be quite straight and ordered. I always thought I could really get back at him if I worked in a bank.\"</p> <p>Jemima wasn't completely strait-laced, though. \"There was a little bit of drinking and drug-taking with Dad. His attitude would have been, 'It's better to do it with me than somebody you don't know.' Later on, it was, 'These are better drugs than you'll get anywhere else.'\" She laughs. \"This may seem terribly unscrupulous behaviour by one's father. It can go either way with kids and it didn't have any effect on me whatsoever. It took the mystery out of a lot of things and I actually found it quite boring.\"</p> <p>Jemima chose university over the chauffeuring in her early 20s, when she found Dury too difficult to live with. \"He was very demanding. You had to be quite a menial person \u2013 get his washing from the laundrette, go shopping, drive here and there. It was part of the deal. He needed people to help him out.\"</p> <p>This was partly because of his disability, but also for other reasons: fame, his \"mollycoddled\" childhood, and a fortysomething crisis over his stalled music career. \"I reckon he was drinking and drugging quite a bit. He wasn't in a happy place,\" she says of the late 1980s.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Dury fully embraced family life when he had two sons, Albert and Bill, with his second wife, Sophy Tilson. Jemima and Baxter also enjoyed spending quieter times with him, although the death of their mother, followed not long afterwards by Dury's cancer diagnosis, made it a fraught few years. Jemima believes Dury tried to protect his children by keeping his distance when \"we needed to get close\". In the final months, however, she, Baxter and Sophy worked in shifts to look after him. \"We had amazing times. It was very special, the couple of weeks before he died. I feel so blessed that he died at home,\" she says.</p> <p>Raising her three children in peaceful Hastings with her partner, Japhy, Jemima wonders about the contrast with her childhood. \"The characters around Dad were extreme and colourful and vibrant. I do worry sometimes that my children are having a really dull existence,\" she says, smiling, and wonders whether she should change things. However, she wouldn't want her world shaken up like her own childhood. \"Although we look back on it as this wonderfully exciting time, it was hellish as well. It was chaotic and difficult and wasn't very emotionally supportive.\"</p> <p>Still, Jemima speaks of the difficult times and her brilliant, tricky dad with unwavering warmth and good humour. And she knows her latest project, tidying his archives and selecting his lyrics for a book, is just the latest stage of her \"daughterising\" of Ian Dury.</p> <p><em>\u2022 \"Hallo Sausages\", The Lyrics of Ian Dury, edited by Jemima Dury, is published on 25 October by Bloomsbury, \u00a325.

  "<h2>6.10pm Quotes from the defeated</h2> <p><strong>Corine Barande-Barbe</strong>, trainer of Cirrus Des Aigles:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"They were very close. We lost [by] two lengths but we'll be better next year! It is no disgrace to be beaten by such a horse and there are no excuses, Frankel is the best. He [Cirrus] will go on his travels now, probably to Hong Kong.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>John Gosden</strong>, trainer of Nathaniel, who is also now retired to stud:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I am thrilled with the result. I think it's what we all wanted. I love the way Frankel came in but he had to race in the end. What a great horse.\" </p> </blockquote> <h2>6pm Frankel's last race</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fsSk2S-s1w8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fsSk2S-s1w8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>5.55pm Timeform rate Frankel's effort today at 139</h2> <p>That's 8lb below the colt's best rating by that firm, indicating that he was a fair way below his best in these conditions. It's only a provisional rating, of course, and they'll do some more analysis before reaching a conclusion.</p> <h2>5.10pm Minor Champion Stakes point</h2> <p>John Gosden gets \u00a3139,880 for being third with Nathaniel. That is probably the result that means Aidan O'Brien can't catch him in the trainer's title race.</p> <h2>4.50pm The curtain falls</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>Khalid Abdulla, owner of Frankel, has confirmed what we all knew, that this was Frankel's final start. He has been a magnificent racehorse and a tremendous boost to the sport.</p> <p>As we've all discovered this week, you can argue all night about whether he's the best ever. Fans of Secretariat, in particular, will be slow to give ground on that point.</p> <p>But he would certainly be the most impressive-looking Flat runner I've ever seen and he leaves us all with some great memories. Heartiest congratulations go to Abdulla, for keeping him in training this year, and to Henry Cecil for training this horse without once putting a foot wrong.</p> <h2>4.45pm Tom Queally speaks</h2> <p>Frankel's jockey was on ATR just now, reacting to that win. \"I'm so proud of him, you know,\" he said. \"It's been an amazing journey. I can't tell you what it's like to be part of it.</p> <p>\"He was a little bit slowly away at York. He was slower today but I've so much belief in this horse. We sort of lost a length but a length is nothing to him.\"</p> <p>Well, it looked like a bit more than a length, Tom, but OK. </p> <p>\"He's everything you could imagine in a horse. It was pointless getting him out on his head before I had to. We were in no rush today, the way the ground was.\"</p> <p>Asked if he felt a lot of pressure, being Frankel's jockey, Queally replied: \"I can think of harder things, now, on the grand scale of things. There is pressure \u2014 there's pressure in all walks of life \u2014 but I'll gladly take that on board.\"</p> <p>Queally said he'd had no trouble sleeping last night. \"By the time i got back from Wolverhampton, i didn't need a sleeping pill. I had to push two round there, so that wore me out sufficiently. I don't get too nervous because I'm close to it and i have control of what's going on. But it's a big thing and you can see what it means to other people.\"</p> <h2>4.30pm Result of the Champion Stakes</h2> <p>1 <strong>Frankel</strong> 2-11<br>2 Cirrus Des Aigles 9-2 <br>3 Nathaniel 9-1</p> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>Frankel has won the Champion Stakes at Ascot and will be retired with his unbeaten record intact. This final victory was not, however, achieved without a degree of drama as the colt made an uncharacteristically slow start to the race and had to work harder than usual to overcome Cirrus Des Aigles.</p> <p>Despite the tension among a sellout crowd of 32,000 at Ascot, Frankel remained calm through the buildup to the race. Indeed, he was perhaps too calm as he walked out of the starting stalls when the race began.</p> <p>Ian Mongan, riding Frankel's pacemaker, Bullet Train, spent the early stages of the race looking around to see where his stable companion had disappeared to. Meanwhile, the French challenger Cirrus Des Aigles got the run of the race near the front and had a handy lead over Frankel as the field turned for home.</p> <p>At that point, Frankel was fourth and came widest into the straight. Tom Queally, his rider, had to push his horse to make sure he went past Cirrus Des Aigles in the final furlong and even used his whip once but his mount was clearly superior by the time the line was reached.</p> <p>Frankel was returned at odds of 2-11, very short but unusually generous in the case of this horse, punters having been put off by concern as to whether he could cope with a saturated racing surface that was heavy in places.</p> <p>The colt will now be retired to stud at Newmarket for a second career as a stallion.</p> <h2>4.13pm Frankel wins!</h2> <p>He keeps his unbeaten record, though Cirrus Des Aigles was a worthy rival and was beaten by less than two lengths. Frankel missed the break, was fourth and widest into the straight but stuck on well as Tom Queally pushed him to the line.</p> <p>Nathaniel was third. </p> <h2>4.11pm Off!</h2> <p>Frankel slowly away and second-last in the early stages</p> <h2>4.04pm Frankel emerges onto the track</h2> <p>He's parading in front of the grandstand, where 32,000 people are a lot more on edge than he appears to be. </p> <h2>4.02pm Colours to the mast</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>As someone who loves to get the favourite beat, I should really be backing Cirrus Des Aigles at 7-1 on Betfair now. Much as I admire Frankel, sentiment wouldn't stop me either. </p> <p>But the way horses have been finishing today does not suggest to me that the round course is such an extreme test as to put Frankel in trouble. I think he'll be too good.</p> <h2>3.56pm Handsome, handsome Frankel</h2> <p>. . . has got his saddle on and is being shown on the Beeb making a last turn of the pre-parade ring before heading for the paddock. He looks relaxed, healthy, fit and alert. Nothing there to worry about.</p> <p>A minder is doing a tremendous job of keeping people and TV cameras at a good distance from the beast. So far, the colt shows no sign of being aware of the atmosphere around him, which is fizzing with anticipation.</p> <h2>3.52pm So here we are and this is it</h2> <p>Time for the Champion Stakes, for which the latest Betfair odds are:</p> <p>1-4 Frankel, 6-1 Cirrus Des Aigles, 16-1 Nathaniel, 89-1 Pastorius</p> <p>Mr Hayler's view:</p> <blockquote> <p>With the significant uncertainty of soft ground coupled with his facing the stiffest opposition of his career, Frankel is unbackable at Ascot today, even with his odds easing to a price at which his fan club might feel forced to show their support. Still, opposing a horse of his calibre would be unfathomable.</p> <p>Ascot's straight course drains quickly, meaning that, whatever the condition of the round course, <strong>Frankel (4.05) </strong>will be racing on the best ground in the final stages of the Qipco Champion Stakes, limiting the possibility that his fearsome turn of foot will be hindered by sloppy turf.</p> <p>Given that Nathaniel's best chance of success will come from being ridden positively, it is unlikely that the pacemaker, Bullet Train, will get to play much of a part. But a similar situation didn't worry Frankel at York last time and those looking for holes in his armour have struggled this season. He is a far more mature performer than in his younger, friskier days.</p> <p>Cirrus Des Aigles brings consistency, toughness and high-class form, but a repeat of his hard-fought victory over So You Think in last year's race simply won't be enough. He's good all right, but he's no Frankel.</p> </blockquote> <h2>3.50pm Aidan O'Brien speaks about Excelebration</h2> <p>\"We are delighted. He's been working brilliant. He's got an awful lot of speed and class, and Joseph was confident. The lads did a great job with him at home. We rode him different that day [when he was beaten by 11 lengths by Frankel in the Queen Anne]. We probably learnt a lot and he's progressing. If he's OK and everybody is happy we'll go to the Breeders' Cup.\" </p> <h2>3.45pm Frankel in the pre-parade ring</h2> <p>. . . as we know from pictures that people are tweeting, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mickfitzg/status/259666441740115968/photo/1/large\">like this one from Mick Fitzgerald.</a></p> <h2>3.45pm Trainers' title update</h2> <p>Excelebration provides his trainer, Aidan O'Brien, with \u00a3567,100 in prize money, which would put him just about level with John Gosden . . . except that the Newmarket trainer got \u00a3107,600 for Elusive Kate's third place. That is roughly the margin by which he now leads. </p> <h2>3.36pm Result of the QEII</h2> <p>1 <strong>Excelebration</strong> 10-11<br>2 Cityscape 5-1<br>3 Elusive Kate 11-2</p> <p>That looked really sticky for Excelebration for a while, as he got trapped against the stands' rail behind Elusive Kate, with Side Glance on his outside. Meanwhile, Cityscape made his move.</p> <p>Joseph O'Brien is pretty cool (some might say a little overconfident on occasion) and he edged Excelebration off the rail and eventually found a gap to go through. Once in the clear, the horse bounded clear. </p> <p>He is dramatically superior to this opposition, which just goes to show how good Frankel must be to have beaten him five times, and by 11 lengths the last time they met. </p> <p>Excelebration has won eight of his last 13 races. Apart from his very first race, he has only ever been beaten when Frankel was among his rivals.</p> <p>That's four wins from four races for Ireland at the so-called British Champions Day.</p> <h2>3.35pm Excelebration wins the QEII</h2> <p>Despite looking in trouble and boxed in for a long way.</p> <h2>3.24pm A royal winner?</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>The Queen is due to present the prize for the next at Ascot, which is named after her. It's the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and she may have to give the trophy to herself, as Carlton House carries her colours.</p> <p>This is the beast that got everyone in such a stew when he ran in the Derby last year. But he was beaten then and has been disappointing a couple of times since.</p> <p>He'd be a surprise winner on this ground. His sire, Street Cry, has a 5% strike-rate with his progeny on soft going.</p> <h2>3.22pm Not today for Lie Forrit</h2> <p>He dropped out with half a mile to go on this first starts since February. But at least he got round and there should be other days for him.</p> <h2>3.18pm Dermot Weld speaks about Sapphire</h2> <blockquote> <p>\"I was confident she would take a lot of beating. She appreciates some ease in the ground and is unbeaten over a mile and a half. I wasn't happy with her just before the Irish Leger, so we decided to concentrate on this and Ascot has always been a lucky track for me. I trained a double at the Royal meeting and we've been fortunate to have 17 Group winners here. I'll have to speak to the owner, but I would say it is unquestionable she will stay in training next year and in the back of my mind she might be a filly for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>3.15pm Next at Ascot, the QEII</h2> <p>. . . for which the Betfair betting is:</p> <p>10-11 Excelebration, 6-1 Cityscape, 6-1 Elusive Kate, 8-1 Carlton House</p> <p>while Mr Hayler tells us:</p> <blockquote> <p>Except for his first ever race, Excelebration has only ever been defeated in races where Frankel was among the opposition. In that one's absence, he can win again, with soft ground having proved no problem in the past. Cityscape is held on the form of the pair's latest meeting and may also not be suited so well by the going, but the quirky Carlton House should go well now, freshened up by a break.</p> </blockquote> <h2>3.10pm Good luck, Lie Forrit</h2> <p>Lie Forrit, favourite for the next at Kelso, would be an enormously popular winner. In every race so far, he has been ridden by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/26/swimming-pool-accident-campbell-gillies\">Campbell Gillies, the popular jockey who tragically lost his life at the age of just 21 while on holiday in Greece this summer</a>. The horse is part-owned by Gillies' mother, Lesley, and will be ridden today by his best friend, Zander Voy. There will hardly be a dry eye in the stands if they get home in front.</p> <h2>3.05pm Going issues</h2> <p>Both winners on the round course so far had already proven their ability to cope with similarly soggy going.</p> <p>Rite Of Passage had won on heavy. Sapphire had won on 'soft to heavy'. </p> <p>Cirrus Des Aigles is the only horse in the Champion Stakes with a previous win on that kind of going.</p> <h2>3pm Fillies &amp; Mares result </h2> <p>1 <strong>Sapphire</strong> 5-2<br>2 Shirocco Star 10-1<br>3 Dancing Rain 7-1</p> <p>Dancing Rain set the pace, with Was also prominent, tracked by La Pomme D'Amour and Great Heavens. Then came the pair who would eventually finish first and second.</p> <p>Shirocco Star went on in the straight and it briefly looked as if she might finally win the big race she has threatened to get all season. But her finishing effort is not the heartiest, whereas Sapphire stayed on stoutly and pulled clear in the closing stages.</p> <p>Well done, Messrs Weld and Smullen. This is a tremendous day for both.</p> <p>Ireland has won all three races so far.</p> <h2>2.57pm Smullen and Weld win again</h2> <p>Sapphire outlasted Shirocco Star in the Fillies &amp; Mares race.</p> <h2>2.52pm Three from three for Ireland?</h2> <p>Sapphire, favourite for this next race, is trained by Dermot Weld, who won the opener with Rite Of Passage. She'd make it a clean sweep for Ireland in the first three races on Champions Day, while the odds-on favourite for the fourth race, Excelebration, is also trained in Ireland.</p> <p>That'll be as far as the run goes, however, as Frankel faces no Irish opposition in the 4.05pm.</p> <h2>2.50pm Next, the Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes</h2> <p>. . . for which the Betfair odds are currently:</p> <p>5-2 Sapphire, 3-1 Great Heavens, 8-1 Dancing Rain, 9-1 La Pomme D'Amour</p> <p>while Mr Hayler advises:</p> <blockquote> <p>The forecast favourite Great Heavens is vulnerable after a hard race in gruelling conditions less than a fortnight ago. The lightly raced Sapphire will have conditions in her favour, but a chance is taken on the outsider Testosterone, better than she has been able to show in two starts for Ed Dunlop and in with a shout on the pick of her French form last year. La Pomme D'Amour is another whose French form should not be underestimated.</p> </blockquote> <h2>2.48pm Nicky Henderson gets his season under way</h2> <p>He's in the winner's enclosure at Cheltenham after his Nadiya De La Vega (10-1) won a handicap chase there. Will Hayler's tip, Finger Onthe Pulse, was third at 28-1.</p> <h2>2.46pm Tom Queally wincing in the spotlight</h2> <p>Frankel's publicity-shy jockey was sitting in the weighing room with a BBC camera moving around him, relaying live pics for about three or four minutes. The longer it went on, the more he squirmed. I should think that would be the least enjoyable part of his day. It seemed to make him a lot more tense than he usually looks in a race.</p> <h2>2.40pm Jamie Spencer speaks after winning on Maarek</h2> <blockquote> <p>\"He's been very consistent all season and he loves soft ground. I got a good lead into the race from Neil [Callan, on The Cheka] and everything worked out perfectly. I wouldn't have gone to the near side if Neil hadn't have gone there. The Cheka is a decent horse, he was second in the July Cup and he handles soft conditions. I got to the front probably sooner than ideal because my lad doesn't do a stroke. I was a bit worried but if something had have taken me further, I'm sure he would have won more comfortably.\" </p> </blockquote> <h2>2.25pm Sprint Stakes result</h2> <p>1 <strong>Maarek</strong> 5-1<br>2 Hawkeyethenoo 25-1<br>3 Sirius Prospect 12-1</p> <p>Four horses raced against the stands' rail, with Maarek tracking The Cheka, Imperial Guest and Medicean Man. Everything else raced towards the middle of the track but it was Maarek who was in front in the final furlong, racing almost alone by that stage.</p> <p>That's a much better result for the winning jockey, Jamie Spencer, who was on Fame And Glory in the opener. The winning trainer is David Nagle, so the Irish have won the first two races on Champions Day.</p> <p>As noted on Racing UK, the horse who was third in the Ayr Gold Cup has won, just ahead of the Stewards' Cup winner. This is a Group Two but so often the talent gap between those major sprint handicaps and the good Group races is tiny.</p> <p>The winning time was a stately 1 minute 15.99 seconds.</p> <h2>2.24pm Two from two for Ireland! Maarek wins</h2> <h2>2.18pm Dermot Weld reflects on Rite Of Passage's win</h2> <blockquote> <p>\"He set a track record when he won the Gold Cup, but he's had serious ongoing tendon problems, so it is a special day to bring him back. A lot of times I thought he'd be retired but he's always had this great will to win and it was a matter of me keeping him sound trying to get him fit. I had a huge concern on his fitness. The plan was to take our time with him and hunt and see if we could ride him to come home and we had Pat [Smullen] to do that. I just had a message from Sir Peter O'Sullevan who said he thought it was one of the best training performances he had ever seen, so that means a lot to me. Provided he is sound, we will look to bring him back here for next year's Gold Cup.\" </p> </blockquote> <h2>2.15pm Those crazy mid-race punters</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook:</strong> Betfair report some amazing betting patterns during that first race, with three horses trading at odds-on before being beaten. Meanwhile, the eventual winner, Rite Of Passage, peaked at 249-1 at one point.</p> <p>Those odds-on losers, with the lowest odds at which they traded:</p> <p><strong>Aiken</strong> 1.12 (about 1-8)<br><strong>Askar Tau</strong> 1.16 (1-6)<br><strong>Fame And Glory</strong> 1.67 (4-6)</p> <h2>2.10pm Next up at Ascot, the Sprint Stakes</h2> <p>. . . for which the Betfair betting at the moment is:</p> <p>100-30 Society Rock, 7-2 Wizz Kid, 7-1 Slade Power, 8-1 Maarek, 9-1 Restiadargent</p> <p>while Mr Hayler advises:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite the fact that Society Rock flopped in this race last year, he has a fine course record and comes into this on the back of arguably his best-ever performance at Haydock. The runner-up, Gordon Lord Byron, certainly didn't do the form any harm when winning at Longchamp earlier this month. The unexposed Slade Power could provide the greatest danger.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last night, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/19/heads-up-restiadargent-sprint-shock\">Will suggested Restiadargent was a value bet at 12-1</a> and we hope some of you took that advice as the French filly is now shorter than that.</p> <h2>2.05pm Over at Cheltenham . . .</h2> <p>According To Trev has won the opening novice hurdle for the Twiston-Davies clan, who are starting the season in typically strong form, holding off the Irish raider Our Vinnie.</p> <h2>1.50pm Rite Of Passage wins!</h2> <p>1 <strong>Rite Of Passage</strong> 8-1<br>2 Aiken 4-1<br>3 Askar Tau 33-1</p> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>Fame And Glory was travelling like the winner at the turn for home, having raced prominently from an early stage, but Aiken was pushed up on his outside in the straight to form a visual representation of the trainer's title race.</p> <p>Aiken stayed on to go past as Fame And Glory folded up but then Rite Of Passage stayed on powerfully to take the lead in the dying strides. Askar Tau also plugged on from the back.</p> <p>Colour Vision was the first beaten and has finished miles out the back. The other Godolphin runner, Opinion Poll, has also been well beaten. </p> <p>The time was 3 minutes 35.98 seconds, suggesting soft ground.</p> <p>Dermot Weld has done wonders to win this with a horse that hadn't raced for 510 days. \"He's forward enough to take his chance but he will need the race,\" Weld was quoted as saying in the Post this morning. Blimey, he'll be pretty straight next time.</p> <p>Gosden gets \u00a343,000 for second and, with O'Brien's horse unplaced, he'll be able to smile about that eventually.</p> <h2>1.46pm Rite Of Passage playing up at the start</h2> <p>This is his first race since May last year and he's a bit on edge.</p> <h2>1.40pm Trainer's title race</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>John Gosden may be just a fortnight from becoming champion trainer for the first time but Aidan O'Brien has chances to go past him again today. The current standings:</p> <p>John <strong>Gosden</strong> \u00a33,381,434<br>Aidan <strong>O'Brien</strong> \u00a32,859,196<br>Richard <strong>Hannon</strong> \u00a32,685,601</p> <p>Everyone else trails by half a million or more.</p> <p>Gosden fields <strong>Aiken</strong> in the first race here and I think it could be argued that he is the only one of the market-leaders for whom the going is pretty good news. Of course, Mr Hayler has jumped the other way with Aidan's Fame And Glory.</p> <h2>1.35pm The going at Ascot . . .</h2> <p>. . . is soft with heavy places on the round course. There was a total of 6mm of rain on Friday but it has been dry since 7.30pm last night. </p> <p>Those who have actually walked the track are mostly saying the ground is not as bad (ie testing) as they'd imagined it would be. Swinley Bottom, the far corner of the track, is normally where all the wet stuff collects but we're told that the stretches immediately before and after that spot are actually the most demanding.</p> <h2>1.30pm Horses in the paddock!</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>We're 15 minutes from the first race of Champions Day at Ascot, for which the latest Betfair odds are:</p> <p>7-2 Opinion Poll, 9-2 Aiken, 6-1 Colour Vision, 13-2 Fame And Glory, 15-2 Ile De Re.</p> <p>Will Hayler's analysis:</p> <blockquote> <p>A repeat of the form shown last year, when he beat Opinion Poll and Colour Vision, should be enough to see Fame And Glory home. Such a performance is not guaranteed, however, after a couple of mulish performances this season, but Aidan O'Brien will have pulled out all the stops at home in order to get him right for this race and Jamie Spencer will surely ride him much more prominently here.</p> </blockquote> <h2>1.25pm Frankel: the stats</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook:</strong> Also from this morning's Post, some interesting stats from Frankel's career. If you add up the times of all his races so far, it comes to a total of 19 minutes 49.58 seconds, which is all the time it has taken for him to earn \u00a32.2m. </p> <p>Apparently, that averages \u00a32k per second, which makes you wonder why they would ever retire him. Someone should ask his owner, Khalid Abdulla, why he can't give us another 20 minutes.</p> <p>Frankel's career earnings, though undeniably impressive, are still shy of Kauto Star's \u00a32.3m. That must be why they decided to run Frankel today! First, second or third place will be enough to get past Kauto's total and you would think he can manage that.</p> <p>Of course, Kauto Star also earned a \u00a31m bonus at one point in his career and, if you take that into account, Frankel can't pass him. </p> <h2>1.20pm Richard Hughes says Frankel will cope</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook:</strong> Richard Hughes, who will be champion jockey this season and is an excellent columnist in the Racing Post, offers an interesting perspective in this morning's paper on the question that absorbs us all: will Frankel cope with such testing ground?</p> <p>\"I was the only jockey to ride his mother, Kind,\" Hughes writes. \"She was never more impressive than when winning [at Hamilton] on ground that was nearly unraceable. We were galloping through water and she loved it. I see no reason why her son won't love it as well.\"</p> <h2>1.15pm Time for some racing</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>The first race on Champions Day is just half an hour away. Frankel's race at 4.05pm will come around before you know it. For fans of jump racing, there's some excellent action at Cheltenham, as well as one significant contest at Kelso. Are you ready for one of the most packed afternoons of the year?</p> <p>I'll be adding live updates for the next three hours as the British Flat season reaches its final climax and the jumps season moves up a gear. Good luck to anyone who's having a bet. Let us know below which ones you fancy.</p> <h2>11.20am Frankel will run</h2> <p><strong>Chris Cook: </strong>Ascot's racing surface, saturated with rain, has nevertheless been approved by those close to Frankel and the colt will run in the Champion Stakes this afternoon. Lord Grimthorpe, racing manager to the horse's owner, Khalid Abdulla, has just walked the course and appeared thoroughly cheerful afterwards.</p> <p>\"It's certainly soft and there are some heavy patches down around Swinley Bottom,\" he told At The Races, but added: \"It's safe ground, so I don't think we'd have any problems.\"</p> <p>Asked if this counted as a green light for Frankel, he replied, smiling: \"I don't think there's any ambers at the moment.\"</p> <h2>Today's best bets, by Will Hayler</h2> <p>With the significant uncertainty of soft ground coupled with his facing the stiffest opposition of his career, Frankel is unbackable at Ascot today, even with his odds easing to a price at which his fan club might feel forced to show their support. Still, opposing a horse of his calibre would be unfathomable.</p> <p>Ascot's straight course drains quickly, meaning that, whatever the condition of the round course, <strong>Frankel (4.05) </strong>will be racing on the best ground in the final stages of the Qipco Champion Stakes, limiting the possibility that his fearsome turn of foot will be hindered by sloppy turf.</p> <p>Given that Nathaniel's best chance of success will come from being ridden positively, it is unlikely that the pacemaker, Bullet Train, will get to play much of a part. But a similar situation didn't worry Frankel at York last time and those looking for holes in his armour have struggled this season. He is a far more mature performer than in his younger, friskier days.</p> <p>Cirrus Des Aigles brings consistency, toughness and high-class form, but a repeat of his hard-fought victory over So You Think in last year's race simply won't be enough. He's good all right, but he's no Frankel.</p> <p><strong>Ascot 1.45</strong> A repeat of the form shown last year, when he beat Opinion Poll and Colour Vision, should be enough to see Fame And Glory home. Such a performance is not guaranteed, however, after a couple of mulish performances this season, but Aidan O'Brien will have pulled out all the stops at home in order to get him right for this race and Jamie Spencer will surely ride him much more prominently here.</p> <p><strong>Cheltenham 2.00</strong> Stamina could prove an issue for some of these, but won't be for Talkonthestreet, who stays well and seems to appreciate an uphill finish.</p> <p><strong>Catterick 2.15</strong> A return to soft turf saw Columella come back to winning form last time and conditions here should pose less of a problem than for some of her rivals. A 3lb rise in the weights for that latest success is reasonable enough, too.</p> <p><strong>Ascot 2.20</strong> Despite the fact that Society Rock flopped in this race last year, he has a fine course record and comes into this on the back of arguably his best-ever performance at Haydock. The runner-up, Gordon Lord Byron, certainly didn't do the form any harm when winning at Longchamp earlier this month. The unexposed Slade Power could provide the greatest danger.</p> <p><strong>Cheltenham 2.30</strong> Tom Taaffe has been in good form with his recent runners and Finger Onthe Pulse could go well at a decent price. He has some form on both courses at Cheltenham and has not only come down in the weights to his lowest mark since winning at the 2008 Festival, but also has a very talented conditional in the saddle taking 7lb off.</p> <p><strong>Catterick 2.50</strong> Granted a huge swing in the weights with Ponty Acclaim since their latest meeting, Burning Thread is entitled to close consideration. The pick of his midsummer form in better contests puts him right in the mix and, although soft ground is a concern, few of these runners seem to relish such conditions.</p> <p><strong>Ascot 2.55 </strong>The forecast favourite Great Heavens is vulnerable after a hard race in gruelling conditions less than a fortnight ago. The lightly raced Sapphire will have conditions in her favour, but a chance is taken on the outsider Testosterone, better than she has been able to show in two starts for Ed Dunlop and in with a shout on the pick of her French form last year. La Pomme D'Amour is another whose French form should not be underestimated.</p> <p><strong>Cheltenham 3.05</strong> Having surged to the front two out, Baby Mix promptly capitulated tamely in last season's Triumph Hurdle and starts the new campaign with questions to answer. He has the class to take this, but Dodging Bullets (in receipt of 8lb) could prove a safer play.</p> <p><strong>Kelso 3.15</strong> In line with most of Willie Amos's small team, Lie Forrit never really got going last season, managing just three starts over fences in uncompetitive novice chases. But as a consequence this talented hurdler is able to switch to handicap company off a sympathetic-looking mark and he may well be ready to win this first time out. The horse is owned by the parents of the jockey Campbell Gillies, tragically killed while on holiday in the summer. Gillies' best friend, Alex Voy, takes the mount on Lie Forrit for the first time.</p> <p><strong>Ascot 3.30</strong> Except for his first ever race, Excelebration has only ever been defeated in races where Frankel was among the opposition. In that one's absence, he can win again, with soft ground having proved no problem in the past. Cityscape is held on the form of the pair's latest meeting and may also not be suited so well by the going, but the quirky Carlton House should go well now, freshened up by a break.</p> <p><strong>Cheltenham 3.40</strong> A winner on his reappearance last season, Exmoor Ranger may be able to repeat the trick. He remains realistically handicapped on his best form and has plenty of good course form to his name. Swincombe Rock is an outsider to watch on his first start for an interesting stable.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has been delivered a humiliating blow, with a broken Andrew Mitchell quitting as chief whip, abandoning a month-long fight to save his career and fend off claims that he had referred to a police officer as a \"pleb\".</p> <p>Mitchell's decision \u2013 relayed to the prime minister personally in a meeting at Chequers after Cameron returned from an EU summit in Brussels \u2013 is a huge blow to the prime minister, who had stood by him in the face of an onslaught by the opposition and the Police Federation and growing doubts among his own backbenchers.</p> <p>Cameron used his authority at prime minister's questions on Wednesday to defend Mitchell from an attack by Ed Miliband and private threats to resign by the deputy chief whip, John Randall.</p> <p>The meeting between Mitchell and Cameron, at 4pm on Friday, came as a separate row was breaking over whether George Osborne had travelled in a first-class train carriage on a standard ticket.</p> <p>In his resignation statement, Mitchell said: \"Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we would both wish. Nor is it fair to continue to put my family and colleagues through this upsetting and damaging publicity.\"</p> <p>He continued to defend himself from claims that he had called the police morons or plebs, claims made by the police officers in Downing Street who faced a bitter verbal volley from Mitchell.</p> <p>The row developed after police refused to open the main gates to allow him to take his bicycle through, instead forcing him to use the side gate. The exact words used by Mitchell on the night have been disputed ever since, with the former chief whip in effect saying the account in the subsequently leaked police log book on the night had been inaccurate.</p> <p>In his resignation letter to Cameron, Mitchell said: \"I have made clear to you \u2013 and I give you my categorical assurance again \u2013 that I did not, never have and never would call a police officer a 'pleb' or a 'moron' or use any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me.</p> <p>\"The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark: 'I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us.' It was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and I am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology.\"</p> <p>Cameron responded: \"I was sorry to receive it, but I understand why you have reached the conclusion you have, and why you have decided to resign from the government.\"</p> <p>The education secretary, Michael Gove, said Mitchell had suffered a moment of exasperation and he praised the prime minister's loyalty: \"I think one of the many reasons why David Cameron is an outstanding leader and an outstanding prime minister is that he believes in backing those who work for him.</p> <p>\"He is not someone who, at the first whiff of trouble, abandons those who've pledged their loyalty to him. I think what you want in any leader is the knowledge that they will back you, that they will show steadiness, that they will do anything they can to ensure the team that's been picked stays together, works together, fights together.\"</p> <p>In a sign of the chaos surrounding No 10, one hour after an official briefing that there would be no announcement of who would replace Mitchell as chief whip, it then emerged that Sir George Young was to replace him.</p> <p>Young, 71, an old Etonian and founder member of the House of Commons bicycling club, had departed his post as leader of the Commons in the summer cabinet reshuffle, a decision he had taken with good grace.</p> <p>He has previously worked in the whip's office and will bring eloquence rather than malevolence to the task of bring the increasingly exasperated backbench MPs into line.</p> <p>Mitchell had hoped he could defuse the row after the police officers at Downing Street accepted his apology and said they did not wish to pursue the matter. He also held less successful contrite meetings with the Police Federation in the West Midlands. Mitchell, only appointed to the post in the September reshuffle, stayed away from the Tory party conference in Birmingham last week in the hope that the issue would subside.</p> <p>But, by Thursday evening, he decided that he simply did not have the support of his backbench colleagues to impose discipline upon them. Some MPs also noticed that the normally ebullient and tough Mitchell was drained of spirit and looked to have lost weight.</p> <p>He contacted the prime minister's office on Thursday and asked to see Cameron on his return to Chequers.</p> <p>Mitchell's decision to quit the post he has craved for more than a decade came following a difficult meeting of the 1922 backbench committee on Wednesday, and then the further soundings he took on Thursday. He was struck by the lack of support he enjoyed among the 2010 intake of Tory MPs, although he was retaining the loyalty of those who had known him for longer.</p> <p>Mitchell also sensed that he was becoming a lightning conductor for wider concerns about the Conservative party being a party of privilege and snobbery. The government already had difficult relations with the police owing to the tough reform programme that it is imposing, and the Mitchell row poisoned relations further.</p> <p>It is understood that Cameron broadly knew why Mitchell wished to see him at Chequers, and carried this news with him through the EU summit. Mitchell knew controversy would continue to dog him, with Labour staging a debate in the Commons next week that would have seen an attempt to dock his pay. The international development select committee was also planning to stage an inquiry into his decision to hand a fresh round of government aid to Rwanda in one of his last acts as international development secretary, his previous cabinet posting. The Rwandan regime has been accused of fomenting violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> <h2>Sir George Young: back on the front line</h2> <p>Sir George Young thought a month ago his life on the front line of politics had come to an amicable closure when he agreed to stand aside as leader of the house in the cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>He happily gave way at the age of 71, creating a restorative berth for Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary. Such is the unpredictability of politics, his semi-retirement lasted less than a month. It will be a familiar experience. He was sacked by Lady Thatcher only to be brought back a few years later. He is clearly someone to whom leaders turn in times of need.</p> <p>For Cameron, his reappointment is doubly helpful. He calms a rocky ship and ensures there does not have to be a wider reshuffle.</p> <p>On the surface, the old Etonian bicycling Baronet will look like a deeply inappropriate person to restore to an administration seeking to shed the patrician image created by Andrew Mitchell episode. But he is courteous, wry, insightful and very much on the left of his party. The quote frequently attributed to him that the homeless are what people leaving the opera have to step over was designed not to slight the homeless but ridicule the rich.</p> <p>Tory MPs from all sides respect him as a House of Commons man: keen to reform parliament and reconnect it to the public. He has tried to give the e-petitions edge by saying they must once they reach a certain level of signatures be considered by a backbench committee responsible for determining the timetable of Commons debate. He has also said MPs rather than government should control more of what happens in the Commons.</p> <p>But as a former deputy chief whip in the Thatcher administration, he is also versed in what makes MPs tick, and from the recent vantage point of leader of the House he will have seen the new intake of Tory MPs close up.

  "<p>You know that winter has started when the power companies put their prices up.

  "<p>One Thursday morning not long ago, I caught a bus to 1957. Alighting at Crouch End Broadway, I walked into the old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsey_Town_Hall\" title=\"\">Hornsey Town Hall</a> and found myself in the office of a&#xa0;television news producer on whose desk was a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Rand\" title=\"\">Remington Rand</a> typewriter, and next to it a stack of typewritten articles from the wires, clamped together with a hefty metal bulldog clip, the top of which was a report about the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2720000/2720723.stm\" title=\"\">marriage of Prince Rainier to Grace Kelly</a>. On the bookshelves, a 1957 explanatory tome about nuclear power rested next to a contemporary <a href=\"http://www.ukwhoswho.com/\" title=\"\">Who's Who</a>. On&#xa0;a&#xa0;smaller, secretary's desk in the anteroom, a&#xa0;1950s seaside postcard was secured under a glass paperweight.</p> <p>The woman whose office this was strode along the corridor, dressed in an orange skirt suit with a&#xa0;teal blouse, her hair rollered, her face powdered and lipsticked. And then I walked through a&#xa0;doorway and the illusion was broken, for in the space of a yard I found myself transported from the 50s Beeb to a Soho nightclub, one where Martini bottles lined the bar and the velvet-swagged tables were sized for two cocktail glasses&#xa0;and a large ashtray.</p> <p>This is the set of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-hour\" title=\"\">The Hour</a>, which arrived on our TV screens last year billed as the British <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\" title=\"\">Mad&#xa0;Men</a>, but turned out to be something quite different. Both shows deal with sexual politics in&#xa0;a world on the brink of seismic change. But in&#xa0;some ways The Hour, set among the makers of a radical new TV news show, has less in common with Don Draper and co than it does with Rona Jaffe's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/08/best-everything-rona-jaffe-review\" title=\"\">The Best Of Everything</a>, a 1958 novel about&#xa0;the first generation of career women in New York, which Draper is at one point seen reading in bed. As in Jaffe's book, the changing role of women is at the very centre of The Hour, which revolves around the character of Bel Rowley, a young producer based on the real-life BBC producer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Wyndham_Goldie\" title=\"\">Grace Wyndham Goldie</a>. Because it takes as its viewpoint the making of a BBC programme about contemporary events, The Hour is very much about Britain: about the British establishment attempting to adapt to or control a world on the edge of dramatic change. The first series was set against the backdrop of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/suez_01.shtml\" title=\"\">the Suez crisis</a>; the second, which reaches screens later this month, a&#xa0;year later in 1957.</p> <p>Writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/abimorgan\" title=\"\">Abi Morgan</a> is on set the day I visit, despite \"the most horrific hangover ever\". Morgan,&#xa0;whose other recent credits include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140396/iron-lady\" title=\"\">The Iron Lady</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142860/shame\" title=\"\">Shame</a>, is loud but tiny; the hangover comes with a long, funny story that involves being accidentally bought champagne by&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362/\" title=\"\">Danny DeVito</a>. Finding the right backdrop for the new series, she tells me, is a process of \"chasing down history to find the story. Thematically, there are two threads \u2013 the nuclear threat and the start of the cold war, and the internal threat caused by immigration and a new clash of culture. The late 1950s is the moment when Britain breaks free from the old establishment, and signs up to a&#xa0;new world order&#xa0;that is all about money. There's so much going on. It's a ticking clock. To me, that's what&#xa0;The Hour symbolises.\"</p> <p>Fast forward a week, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/romola-garai\" title=\"\">Romola Garai</a> \u2013 the wearer of the aforementioned orange skirt suit \u2013 strides into a Shoreditch photographic studio in an <a href=\"http://www.isabelmarant.tm.fr/\" title=\"\">Isabel Marant</a> cotton top (\"Horribly, horribly expensive, but it is literally my favourite top ever\") and high-waisted jeans, carrying a pack of cigarettes and a take-out coffee. It is the morning after the wrap party, and Garai and her co-stars, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-west\" title=\"\">Dominic West</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/29/ben-whishaw-the-hour?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Ben Whishaw</a>, are back in 2012. Today, they are to be shot in both 1950s and contemporary fashion. It is the modern clothes that Garai is more concerned about: she has what costume designers quaintly call \"an old-fashioned figure\", and that she refers to more colourfully as \"plenty of junk in the trunk\".</p> <p>\"What happened with The Hour,\" she tells me, \"was basically that I picked up the script and the first line I read was, 'Bel is sitting at her desk.' And I was like, well, this is fucking amazing. This part is mine. Because how often are you ever introduced to a young female character and she's sitting behind an actual desk? The main thing I'm interested in is that I don't want the women I play to be defined by their romantic involvement with the male lead. I want them to have a job. So the fact that Bel having a job is the first thing we know about her was a huge deal for me.\"</p> <p>Garai says she recognises a lot of Bel's character&#xa0;in herself. \"We are similar in being ambitious, young women who love our jobs and are truly passionate about them. And who are interested in&#xa0;the world around them, and in politics. But we are different in that Bel is a real diplomat with people, which I'm not at all. I say what I think, and then get into trouble.\" She tries&#xa0;to look sheepish about this, but it's not particularly convincing. \"Actually, I think it's OK&#xa0;to fight for what you care about. The best piece of advice I was given about work was by someone who told me that it's OK to have conflict. I think sometimes women need to be reminded of that.\"</p> <p>\"Hello, Romsey Poms!\" With this greeting to Garai, Dominic West, who plays Hector in The Hour, bursts into the makeup room. He positions himself in front of the mirror, which is the largest in the studio, to check his reflection in the outfit he has been dressed in. (As the shoot progresses, West is often to be found in front of this mirror; Whishaw, on the other hand, tends to&#xa0;slope off to a bathroom to inspect his reflection without an audience.) Garai, who missed the wrap party, asks West how it was. \"Marvellous! Just marvellous. There were dancing girls, Romsey Poms, and you know how I&#xa0;love dancing girls.\" Garai rolls her eyes at me in the makeup mirror, hugs West, and announces fondly that, \"Dominic is an idiot, obviously, but actually we all get on incredibly well. Not just us three [with Whishaw], but everyone. There is a&#xa0;lot of corpsing on the set of&#xa0;The Hour. One day, we got so hysterical they had to clear the set and send us all back to our rooms. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/21/anna-chancellor-interview-the-hour\" title=\"\">Anna [Chancellor]</a> had tears streaming down her face, they had to redo her makeup. We&#xa0;got into so much trouble.\"</p> <p>Later, Whishaw describes it as \"amazing, just a&#xa0;lovely, lovely set. It seems odd to talk about the&#xa0;three of us because the others, like Anna [Chancellor] and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2772105/\" title=\"\">Oona [Chaplin]</a>, are such a vivid part of it. There is just a huge, huge amount of love and honesty and laughter.\"</p> <p>But while The Hour was lavished with praise for its 1950s style, Garai is notably less effusive when we discuss Bel's wardrobe. \"The clothes are&#xa0;the one element of the programme that I feel rather ambivalent about. My choice would have been for her to be dressed in a more realistic way, which would be much tweedier. But needless to say the producers were keen for her to&#xa0;look as glamorous as possible. I feel strongly that how Bel dresses is not how someone in that environment would really have dressed. She wouldn't have wanted to look glamorous, to make herself vulnerable to criticism in that way. If it was down to me, it would've been tweed suits and brogues.\"</p> <p>Many of the same tastes apply in real life, she says, despite today's ultrafashionable Marant. \"I&#xa0;wear a lot of navy and grey, and I do love woolly&#xa0;tights. My sister says I dress like a French teacher. The level of grooming that was involved for women in the 1950s is completely alien to me. I don't wax. I barely shave. If I do my own makeup, I look like I've been to a burns unit.\"</p> <p>The second series of The Hour sees Whishaw's&#xa0;character, Freddie, return older, wiser&#xa0;and better poised as a meaningful rival to Hector for the status of the show's alpha male. As&#xa0;interviewees, the two actors could scarcely be&#xa0;more different. Whishaw sits facing me, neatly cross-legged, hair falling over his eyes, elfin face resting on the points of long-fingered pianist's hands. When he answers a question, he closes his&#xa0;eyes and leans forward, to speak directly into my tape recorder. He talks very slowly, and after Garai's galloping gossip it takes me a few minutes&#xa0;to adjust, so I find myself asking the next&#xa0;question only to realise he is still pondering the last. When West's turn comes, he sprawls on the sofa with one arm thrown across the back, claiming maximum space like a tiger prowling the&#xa0;boundaries of his cage, angling what I suspect he knows is his best side towards me. It is a measure of his charm that he is, despite all this, impossible to dislike.</p> <p>Whishaw, like Garai, was drawn to the character as written by Morgan. \"Freddie is one of those characters you'd like to be more like, in real life. We're similar in that we're both a bit obsessive, but he's braver, bolder. He has absolute courage in his convictions. He's not a saint, but at the centre of him is something very admirable. I think it would be lovely to have that conviction, that very clear belief structure. I guess I wish I had that.\" Whishaw has a whimsical, meandering way of talking, and a tendency to start stories that don't go anywhere. (On clothes: \"I once had a pair of jeans I really liked. I loved them, they were perfect! And then they fell apart and, um, well I&#xa0;didn't buy another pair.\") His ideal day off, he says, would be wandering around the markets and flower markets in east London, where he lives. \"I like to sort of drift about.\"</p> <p>West swears a great deal, loudly and with immaculate enunciation, in the manner of Hugh Grant in Four Weddings. Eton educated, he shook&#xa0;off the posh actor label when he scored his&#xa0;role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a>; having done that, he is free to play posh again. \"Hector is old-school. He was at D-day. But his ambition means that he has to try to leave that behind, to straddle the old establishment and the new.\" A bit like you then? He starts to laugh. \"Well, I think we both enjoy a&#xa0;party. Wine, women and song, you know.\" He smiles at me, longing for the&#xa0;woman from the Guardian to get wound up, so I ignore him and ask about something else, at which point he cuts in to announce, \"I do quite like winding people up. I enjoy winding Romola up, especially. Probably because I just adore her. The thing about Romola is\" \u2013 he calls her \"Romsey Poms\" only when she's there to be teased, I notice \u2013 \"that she doesn't seem to have the slightest idea how sexy and beautiful she is. Oh, fuck, fuck, don't quote me on that. She'll fucking kill me.\" He actually looks quite scared.</p> <p>The Hour's art director is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829378/\" title=\"\">Eve Stewart</a>, whose CV ranges from Mike Leigh films to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzI4D6dyp_o\" title=\"\">The King's Speech</a>. \"I've never known anyone like her,\" Garai says. \"In one meeting scene, I had a piece of&#xa0;paper in my hand, which you couldn't see on camera, and I looked down and it was a precis of&#xa0;a&#xa0;story that had been mentioned in passing in the script as a story The Hour might have covered&#xa0;that week \u2013 the first African American air&#xa0;hostess, I think it was. And it was a proper printed two-page report, on the original 1950s paper&#xa0;typed on an&#xa0;authentic period typewriter. Factually accurate. I mean, is she mad? But there's something about a&#xa0;show in which every department completely commits to making the&#xa0;show real, which somehow transmits itself to&#xa0;the audience.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the&#xa0;on-set office of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147031/\" title=\"\">Suzanne Cave</a>, the costume designer, is plastered with moodboards building a visual backstory for the characters, textured with both contemporary references and those that either layer in other references or add a&#xa0;modern element, helping the clothes read easily to a 21st-century eye. So for Bel's character there are tearsheets from <a href=\"http://www.anothermag.com/exclusives/rachel-weisz\" title=\"\">a shoot of Rachel Weisz in AnOther Magazine</a>, which Cave loved for the saturated block-colour outfits (a true-to-1957 trend that looks right and glamorous for today); for Chancellor's character, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/features/thehour/aps/lix.shtml\" title=\"\">Lix Storm</a>, there are photos of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/katharinehepburn\" title=\"\">Katharine Hepburn</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Sontag\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag</a>; for Freddie, there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jackkerouac\" title=\"\">Jack Kerouac</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesdean\" title=\"\">James Dean</a>, all turned-up collars and shy swagger.</p> <p>The Hour's costumes are a labour of love. The&#xa0;showgirls' stagewear was created by layering strings of pearls, yards of lace and pieces of jet fringing on to old-fashioned corsetted underwear from John Lewis. But the biggest visual challenge, Stewart says, is \"boring offices. They are quite difficult to get right, because no one takes photographs of their boring offices, so it's&#xa0;hard to get the information. And it's the detail&#xa0;that matters.\"</p> <p>So she was thrilled, when first seeing the Hornsey Town Hall building, to find that the door handles were from the correct period (\"You wouldn't believe how long it can take to source the right door handles\"). \"My job is to create a&#xa0;bubble of belief where the story can become real. I do think that if I can help the actors believe, that transmits itself to the audience, almost in a&#xa0;subliminal way. But on the other hand, I know that this all sounds mad.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> The new series of The Hour begins on BBC2 in November.</p>",
  "<p>Has there ever been a performer so sure of himself on stage and so lacking in self-belief off? In front of a packed house, or presenting a TV show, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/derren-brown\" title=\"\">Derren Brown</a> is&#xa0;the commander, a man of barking certainty. But ask why he became a magician, and he ticks and&#xa0;twitches and starts to drown in his own diffidence. \"You get into it because you don't feel impressive,\" he says. \"It's the quickest, most fraudulent route to impressing people\u2026 Finding magicians who are sexually well-adjusted and have great social skills is not always the easiest thing.\" And this is the new, confident Derren Brown. God knows what he was like before.</p> <p>Brown is Britain's leading magician/hypnotist/illusionist/mentalist, call it what you will. He predicts the lottery numbers and plays Russian roulette on live TV. He quotes whole pages of the&#xa0;dictionary called out at random, paints a brilliant upside-down Elvis while correctly guessing who an audience member is thinking of, is unbeatable at rock-paper-scissors, and can make someone double up in agony from an imaginary punch in the stomach. He even convinced a man who was scared of flying to emergency-land a plane, and encouraged a law-abiding citizen to carry out an armed robbery. I&#xa0;can't get enough of Derren Brown.</p> <p>But I'm not sure why. His shtick is annoying \u2013 the thespish voice, self-conscious goatee, obvious &#xa0;word manipulation, and the way he seems to tell you how he is doing something but&#xa0;never quite does. Yet there is something compelling about him&#xa0;Over the years, Brown seems to have evolved from a slick trickster into a man with a&#xa0;genuine curiosity about what can be achieved, for good or bad, when people change the way they think. In his new television show, Apocalypse, he takes a&#xa0;man who admits he is complacent about life and teaches him how to appreciate the world\u2026 by convincing him it has been destroyed.</p> <p>Before we meet, I'm hoping for one thing \u2013 to be hypnotised. But it's not going to happen. In interview after interview, Brown has refused to do tricks on journalists, let alone put them into an altered state. He insists there is nothing magical or supernatural in what he does; it's all about finding suitably suggestible people to work with \u2013 and, as a rule, that does not include journalists.</p> <p>Brown arrives, dressed in brown and carrying an aged brown leather bag that could belong to a&#xa0;17th-century mountebank. His voicer is quieter, more diffident than on stage, and he's impeccably polite. From the off, he tells me how his act was rooted in his insecurities. He grew up in Purley, south London, and attended the school where his father was the swimming instructor. While his dad was strong and fit, Brown suggests he was an effete irritant. He was useless at sport, clever, unpopular and craved attention. \"I was part of a&#xa0;very uncool group. It was a group that liked classical music. They were known as the Music School Gang or, less charitably, the Poof Gang.\"</p> <p>He was also a talented artist, and gradually drew his way into his fellow pupils' affections. \"I did caricatures of the teachers, and it was very much about being in the spotlight. I was probably insufferable. Going back and catching up with teachers has confirmed that I was a bit of a dick.\"</p> <p>He was always an A-grade student, and went on&#xa0;to study law and German at Bristol University. That was when he first came into contact with magic. He went to see a hypnotist perform who also did tricks, and was transfixed. This, he decided, was the way to woo people.</p> <p>There was a time when he tried to prove himself by stealing \u2013 the kleptomania years. \"It&#xa0;was the 1980s, and I loved gadgets, and there&#xa0;were loads of gadgets out for boys.\" Where&#xa0;did he steal from? \"That's Entertainment in Croydon.\" He pauses. \"I&#xa0;think it's safe to say it now.\" Did he feel guilty? \"No.\" Was it thrilling? \"Oh yeah. It was the techniques, picking up a few things, slipping one in your bag as you go. It was before I was doing magic.\" What was the most valuable item he stole? \"Something called a Pin Matrix. You put your face into it and it&#xa0;makes the shape of your face with pins. I loved it, but they were \u00a325, a huge amount. I remember once looking round my bedroom and going, 'God, I've nicked pretty much everything.'\" Did he ever get caught? \"Never\u2026 Except once, when I slipped a Luther Vandross cassette tape into my pocket and set the alarms off. I clocked a couple of plain-clothed security guards and was with a friend who didn't know I'd&#xa0;nicked it, so I did a whole pantomime thing of, 'Oh my God! How did I put that in my pocket?'\"</p> <p>Looking back, he says, it's not surprising others were so quick to take the piss out of him. \"Things I've done in the past always make me cringe a bit.\" What makes him cringe most? \"When I think back to being a Christian. Proselytising to people, that makes me cringe.\" He was five when his parents sent him to Bible class. The funny thing is, Brown says, they weren't even practising Christians; they just thought it was the right thing to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398618729\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350477157244/Derren-Brown-plays-Russia-008.jpg\" alt=\"Derren Brown plays Russian roulette on live TV\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brown hit the big time when he played Russian roulette on live TV in 2003. Photograph: Rex </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, Brown is a confirmed atheist, and has come to believe that religion was a useful prop for him \u2013 when he was trying to come to terms with who he was or, perhaps more pertinently, was desperately trying to deny it. Four years ago, Brown came out as gay. For much of his early life, he says, he tried to project himself as asexual, somehow above sex. Christianity gave him the perfect opportunity to reject feelings and subjects that discomfited him, to the extent that he came across as a prig, while giving him the identity he so craved. \"Belief becomes part of your identity. And if you feel not very impressive, it's a good feeling to be able to go, 'Oh, sorry, could you not make that joke please, because I'm a Christian.'\"</p> <p>For a long time, he says, he tried to train himself out of his homosexuality. But to no avail. One of the things that made him so unhappy, he says, was he felt so removed from a world with which he would have loved to have been at ease. \"I didn't go out drinking, wasn't going to the gym, and that whole world I didn't fit into. That feeling of alienation can turn into an envy, and it becomes an issue. Sexuality is often tied in with something you feel you lack in yourself and look for in others.\"</p> <p>That is where the act came in so useful. Once he could do a few tricks, he became interesting to those who had fiercely rejected him. \"The people who often responded well to it were the lads, and suddenly I was in the position of a) being quite cool among them, and b) having control of them, which is very different from being intimidated by them. I was suddenly an authority in this world.\" In short, magic replaced religion. Perhaps it was inevitable. His Christian friends were appalled at his new hobby, and many thought he had been hijacked by the devil.</p> <p>Just as he created a character out of his Christianity, he did so out of his magic. This time round, instead of the prude, he became a cape-flaunting eccentric, surrounded by parrots he hypnotised with a blink, tortoises he took for walks on a&#xa0;lead and stuffed animals.</p> <p>As he talks, I'm watching closely for those little hand gestures he uses to put people to sleep on stage, or repeated word patterns that will put thoughts into my head. But he's too busy beating himself up to manipulate me. Finally, I just come out with it: \"Is there no way you could make me do something stupid to show off your powers?\"</p> <p>But he doesn't bite. \"Hypnosis is just suggestibility; you see it in certain people.\"</p> <p>What about an imaginary punch in the stomach?</p> <p>\"As a journalist, you'd be a classically bad subject for it.\"</p> <p>\"Well, couldn't you just make me incapable of&#xa0;talking for a minute or two?\"</p> <p>\"It won't work,\" he says decisively. And that seems to be final.</p> <p>Only I tell him that I'm infinitely suggestible, and plead pathetically. \"OK, rest your elbow on your knees. And look down at your left hand. Imagine a balloon, and the balloon is attached to the wrist of the hand. A helium balloon. And the balloon pulls at the string and the string pulls at the wrist of the hand. And as you watch the back of the hand, you can just imagine the hand getting lighter.\" Suddenly Derren Brown is talking to me quietly, suggestively, seductively, a horse whisperer of the magic world.</p> <p>Some minutes later, I'm aware my arm is straight up in the air, my eyes are glued tight and I'm slumped. I feel sure I can open them easily, but something is stopping me. \"And in a moment I'll count you awake backwards from 10 to zero and give you all the time you need to be fully awake and refreshed, and what you will notice when you wake up is a natural inquisitiveness to look inside your coffee cup, the sense that there might be something inside there. Whether it's the&#xa0;desire to look at the coffee or the thought that&#xa0;I might have put something in there, the more you try to ignore it, the more you try to forget, to not think about it, to not obsess about it, the stronger it can become. Until the only relief&#xa0;you can get from that is to finally open the lid and look inside. I'll count you awake: 10, 9 and 8, you can just start to feel yourself becoming more refreshed and waking up\u2026 And then whenever you're ready to be fully wide awake... 3, 2, 1, zero. And you can open your eyes. It feels nice. Always a tendency to smile.\"</p> <p>I open my eyes and smile like a stoner. It's the first time I have fallen asleep in an interview. A&#xa0;couple of minutes later, the publicist walks in and says time is up. I beg for longer, explaining that I've been out of it for the past 20 minutes. She gives me a funny look and walks off.</p> <p>\"I know what you said about the coffee,\" I say.</p> <p>\"Of course,\" Brown replies.</p> <p>\"I'm going to try not to be inquisitive about it.\"</p> <p>\"Please do.\"</p> <p>I bring the coffee to my lips. It smells strange. \"It smells funny to me.\"</p> <p>\"I'm sure you'll find your reason,\" he says gently.</p> <p>\"You're making me look inside because it tastes and smells weird,\" I say. I'm beginning to sound aggressive.</p> <p>\"Mind games, all mind games,\" he says.</p> <p>We talk about how his work has evolved. Initially, he says, he had to be at the heart of everything. If&#xa0;he didn't dazzle, it wasn't Derren Brown. The ultimate example was <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3npiw_derren-brown-russian-roulette-tvdow_fun\" title=\"\">the time he played Russian roulette in Jersey</a>. Again, there was controversy. Jersey police claimed he had used blank bullets. He insists that's not true (though he used blanks to practise) and that the police statement could have had terrible repercussions. \"We thought, somebody's going to end up doing it with blank bullets, and think, 'Ah, well, it must be all right then', but people have killed themselves doing it with blank bullets. That could happen and we'd have been seen as responsible for it.\"</p> <p>Could he have killed himself? \"Yes.\" And it was really live TV? \"Yes.\" So what if the screen had ended up splattered with his brains? \"I wouldn't have done it unless I was 100% sure.\"</p> <p>\"How <em>can</em> you be 100% sure?\" I find myself shouting at him.</p> <p>\"Because that's what I do. It's my job. I have secret ways.\" Could he imagine making a similar show now? \"I don't think I would. At the time it was a way of drawing a lot of attention to myself \u2013 as a show, it was making my mark, and I don't want to do that kind of thing any more.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398618730\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350476836594/Derren-Brown-predicting-t-006.jpg\" alt=\"Derren Brown predicting the lottery numbers on live TV\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Predicting the lottery numbers on live TV was a huge hit. Photograph: Equinoxfeatures.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Equinoxfeatures.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor could he see himself doing something like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/sep/11/derren-brown-lottery-trick\" title=\"\">the lottery show</a> again. \"The lottery thing is the one thing I've done that I really wasn't happy with. I was fairly happy with the prediction show; the actual trick itself.\" But he says the following show, given over to explaining how he'd done it, did not live up to its billing. What happened, he says, is that everything spun out of control.</p> <p>His lottery prediction was front-page news, questions were asked in parliament, the BBC was under scrutiny and he didn't really know how to cope. He was expecting to put out a show for his fans, who would accept a fishy explanation or laugh it off. But this time the whole country was waiting for an answer, and didn't get an acceptable one. Was the show a complete con? \"Well, it was a trick. Clearly I can't actually predict a future event.\"</p> <p>He recently suggested that 2006's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgiYvAsQmJA\" title=\"\">The Heist</a>, in which he encourages members of the public to do an armed robbery, was the first honest programme he's made. What did he mean by that? \"It was honest in the sense that it was the first thing that wasn't, 'Look at me, I'm the master of mind-reading and control.' It was genuinely finding out&#xa0;whether these techniques could be used to get people to do antisocial things.\"</p> <p>He says his subsequent TV shows have also been honest \u2013 if not in the literal sense. In <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derren-brown-the-specials/4od#3128449\" title=\"\">Hero At 30,000 Feet</a>, he convinces a young man, Matt, that he is landing a plane \u2013 Matt appears to go through every emotion he would experience, even though he isn't aware that the plane is just a&#xa0;sophisticated simulation. Matt also shows his new-found courage by lying on a rail track locked into a straitjacket with a train hurtling at him. Again, the truth is more emotional than real. What if Matt had not managed to get out of the straitjacket in time? \"The train is going a little slower than the music,\" Brown admits. Was there a chance he could have been mashed by the train? \"No, we'd never be allowed to do it if there was. It's clearly our train we're in control of, it's got cameras on it. And we had a stuntman standing by; we had a way of quick-releasing Matt from the stuff he was in.\" So how fast was it going? \"I can't give you a figure. Not that fast. But from where he is, which is also our camera angle, it's terrifying and looks fast enough, thank you. The reality is that it's fast enough to give him that experience and slow enough to make sure it didn't chop his head off.\" How could he be sure somebody like Matt won't have a heart attack? Brown says so much of&#xa0;the skill is in choosing the right candidate. We don't see all the people he rejects.</p> <p>Time flies when you're hypnotised. Brown's got to get on a train to Doncaster to finish recording his new shows, so we jump in a cab to King's Cross. I'm still seeing the world through glazed eyes. Along Westminster, we pass a white lorry with HYPNOS printed on it. \"Did you plant that?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"I did. It's all part of the plan.\"</p> <p>Has he ever been to a hypnotist. Yes, he says, for the twitching. It didn't work. Is his boyfriend, Marc, interested in magic? Absolutely not, he says \u2013 he's a designer, they've been an item for seven years and he couldn't care less about Brown's work.</p> <p>In the new series, Brown doesn't appear to Stephen, the main \"character\", until the end, by which time he will have discovered that he isn't really one of the few survivors in a post-apocalyptic world, but in fact the star turn in a new Derren Brown show. He says that Stephen will hopefully have been on a \"transformative journey\" to make him value his life \u2013 and immediately apologises. \"I always cringe when I say that.\"</p> <p>What does he hope Stephen will gain from the experience? \"I want to see genuine change rather than just a TV thing where somebody seems more confident at the end.\" How will he measure that? \"I'm not doing these things every week. It's quite easy to remain friends. It's important to me that it&#xa0;works \u2013 particularly when he's going through something potentially quite horrific.\"</p> <p>Brown says he likes the show, but is under no illusion that he's doing anything new. Just as he nabbed bits from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment\">Milgram</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment\" title=\"\">the Stanford prison experiment</a> for The Heist, now he's jackdawed the Roman philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger\" title=\"\">Seneca</a>. \"Seneca would say, to get out of the cycle of wanting things you haven't got, the way to master that is to learn to desire what you already have. So Seneca's thing was to mentally rehearse losing things you love, so you come to value them more.\"</p> <p>In a way, he says, what he has learned over the years is that his gifts don't need to be used merely to entertain, they can be an agent of change. Could he imagine himself doing something totally different with his life? \"Oh yes,\" he says enthusiastically. \"There's something very puerile about TV. There's still something a bit show-off about it. Maybe I will move into something different.\" So what does he fancy? \"Teaching,\" he&#xa0;says instantly. \"That's something I've often thought about. Maybe in a primary school \u2013 teaching a&#xa0;bit of everything.\" And with that we part \u2013 him contemplating a&#xa0;new career, me the wonders of hypnosis. As I&#xa0;walk away, I&#xa0;feel something in my coat pocket. The empty coffee cup. It still smells&#xa0;funny.</p> <p>\u2022 Derren Brown: Apocalypse starts on 26 October on Channel 4.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2012. The original said Brown had \"nabbed bits from Milgram's Stanford prison experiment\" for The Heist. That conflated two separate experiments: Stanley Milgram's study on obedience to authority figures, and the Stanford experiment into the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or a guard.</p>",

  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching season three of The Walking Dead on FX. Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen episode one \u2013 and if you\u2019ve seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers.</em></p> \n<p>Well, that was quite a comeback. The previous two seasons had very strong first instalments but tonight had it all: style, economy, character, humour and some of the most intense and sustained scenes of blood-soaked TV carnage since the last season of Spartacus splattered its way across screen. This might not have been the best ever episode of The Walking Dead but it\u2019s probably in the top two. It had the gore but so much more besides.</p> \n<p>The pre-title, cold opening was a great reintroduction to the characters \u2013 and for a few wonderful seconds it looked like the near-subliminal T-Dog was going to speak the first words of the season. We caught up with events without a word being spoken. Lori\u2019s growing pregnancy bump (is it Shane\u2019s or Rick\u2019s baby?) showed us months had passed; cleaning the house of zombies revealed how routine it had all become; supplies, clearly, have been hard to come by. (Although Daryl\u2019s owl \u2013 which presumably tastes like old, wise chicken \u2013 looked good).</p> \n<p>It was nice to see that they\u2019d been improvising on the road; the guns had DIY silencers, Rick\u2019s was crafted from a torch. And that everyone had a role to play, with young Carl proving surprisingly useful \u2013 but then I guess everyone has to step up and grow up in a zombie apocalypse when you\u2019re soon back on the road, repeating the same grim, dispiriting, enterprise.</p> \n<p>Even the post-credits chat seemed more lean and to-the-point than previously. And for those wondering why fans of the comics have kept banging on about the prison, then this episode will have gone some way to providing an answer: it\u2019s where the story really got going.</p> \n<p>From a practical standpoint, the prison is a great place to hole up: walls designed to keep things in are just as good at keeping things out. In the huge volume of movies and literature about zombies, it seems surprising that no one else had thought of using one. It\u2019s one of the things that makes The Walking Dead a stand-out in a genre that should have played out all its good moves by now.</p> \n<p>From this point in we had three major, and quite varied, action scenes: the clean up of the grounds, the yard and then the cell blocks. The only real moment of calm was when Herschel\u2019s daughters treated us to a nicely sung version of Parting Glasses. It was nice, too, that the campfire scene still had zombies hanging around the fences in the background \u2013 the constant, underlying threat that was missing for a lot of last season is back. And there was a good mixture of styles tonight. Any show that can slow things down for a sing-song then, later, have such disorienting and nightmarish scenes as those within the depths of the prison, is doing something right.</p> \n<p>After the groundwork of the first two seasons, there\u2019s also much less need for exposition-heavy dialogue, and this episode includes some great one-liners tonight, expertly delivered by actors settled into their roles. From Daryl\u2019s bone-dry \u201cThat\u2019s a shame!\u201d when he saw the prison was crawling, to Maggie\u2019s gleeful \u201cSee that!\u201d having driven a knife through a zombie\u2019s jaw up into its brain. Best of all was Carol\u2019s one-worder, her matter-of-fact \u201csorry\u201d after she narrowly missed shooting Rick.</p> \n<p>On the subject of Carol, it was a good week all round for her. In season one she was the downtrodden wife of a brutish husband, season two had her frantic over her missing daughter Sophia, and although both were very well played by Melissa McBride in the general climate of inactivity, such traits soon became unsympathetic, annoying even. Tonight we met a new Carol, released from such stress. She seemed to be the only one to really enjoy the grounds clean up and she even got flirty with Daryl. Go Carol! And good also that the show\u2019s only real moments of intimacy involved checking for zombie scratches and a sore shoulder from too much gunplay.</p> \n<p>So we\u2019re left with Hershel getting a bite on the leg. Was Rick fast enough to amputate? Even though he can cleave the top off the head of a walker in a single machete swipe, it still took 10 painful and meaty sounding chops to lose that pesky leg. Now we realise they are far from alone in the prison, of course, next week really must start exactly from where we left things off tonight.</p> \n<p>But first we must mention Michonne\u2019s short but impressive turn slaying a few zombies with her Katana, utilising the same flick of the sword as when she appeared last season \u2013 surely a signature move. She\u2019s not been named onscreen yet, so I\u2019m looking forward to hearing the correct pronunciation of her name and finding out what she and Andrea have been up to. Her chained, jawless and armless zombie baggage carriers are also intriguing, to say the least.</p> \n<p><strong>Zombie of the Week:</strong> Zombie-wranglers KNB EFX Group have continually outdone themselves \u2013 keeping the kills varied and delivering at least one outstanding undead scene a week. Competition was fierce in this episode, but the prize goes to Rick \u2013 who pulled the mask off the riot-gear zombie only for its rotten face to come away too. It\u2019s the kind of surprise \u201cgag\u201d FX folk love to do, and a real crowd-pleaser.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.dugganmorrisarchitects.com\" title=\"\">Joe Morris, architect</a><br></h2> <p>Our life is measured: we don't have much clutter, and we're frugal. If one of us sees something we like \u2013 a vase, say \u2013 we'll have a&#xa0;discussion about it&#xa0;and put it through a vigorous selection process. We're <a href=\"http://dugganmorrisarchitects.com/\" title=\"\">architects</a> \u2013 we're control freaks, and trained to&#xa0;think about these things.</p> <p>Our last house was a Victorian semi, and before that we always lived in period conversions. But our dream was an open-plan space. We found the perfect site in Peckham, south London \u2013 a&#xa0;derelict plot with small industrial sheds, lean-tos and weeds \u2013 and have built a two-storey brick house with a double-height living space, a&#xa0;glass roof, large windows and lush courtyard gardens.</p> <p>Contemporary living does not suit labelling rooms with specific functions: we prefer free-flowing spaces that can be adapted to your needs. At first, it was only me and my partner, Mary, so we didn't feel the need to carve up the space into rooms. The only enclosed room is the bathroom. We now have a three-month-old daughter, Margot. Her cot is in our bedroom space, and we haven't acquired much baby clutter.</p> <p>The space requires management. I&#xa0;have to stay on top of letters and bank statements \u2013 I'm a bit obsessed about having things lying around. In&#xa0;an ideal world, everything would be digital. Things people might perceive as clutter \u2013 books, magazines, ceramics, glassware \u2013 can be easily stored away. We got cards and flowers when Margot was&#xa0;born, but cards are easily folded and the flowers didn't last.</p> <p>Compared with our last house, there's a greater sense of space. The&#xa0;materials are more robust \u2013 timber, brick, oak joinery, polished concrete \u2013 so it's easier to be relaxed here. There's no wallpaper to nick or&#xa0;curtains to pull down. When our nieces and nephews visit, they go ballistic, and nothing gets damaged. It's low-maintenance \u2013 the floor needs sweeping and it's clean. It suits me, as I'm busy. I leave the house at 6.30am and often don't get home until 9pm.</p> <p>We left our furniture in the old house, which we rent out. It was cathartic, but sparse at the beginning. We've added furniture bit by bit, from design shops, eBay and markets. It has made the space feel bigger. It's easier to make pieces work here than in a Victorian house, where contemporary furniture can look out of place. Here, a battered Chesterfield would work as well as a&#xa0;futuristic sofa. The house is a bit like a blank canvas.</p> <p>It's an uplifting environment to live in, particularly with the dense landscaping outside. The worst thing about living here is that you want to build another one.</p> <p><strong>King's Grove was shortlisted for the&#xa0;</strong><a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBASpecialAwards/StephenLawrencePrize/StephenLawrencePrizeShortlist2012.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>Stephen Lawrence Prize</strong></a><strong> at this year's Riba Stirling Prize.</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.stylebubble.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Susie Bubble</a>, fashion blogger</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398059903\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/12/1350046506838/Homes-Susi-Bubble-001.jpg\" alt=\"Homes: Susi Bubble\" width=\"200\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here, there and everywhere: Susie Bubble in the one-bed flat she shares with her boyfriend. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Garland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not messy \u2013 there's only so much you can do with a&#xa0;small space. The flat is tiny: one bedroom, a&#xa0;living/kitchen area and a bathroom. The bedroom is so filled with stuff, I get into bed by rolling in from the bottom. My boyfriend and I try to keep it tidy, but we own a lot of stuff between us \u2013 he's into clothes too.</p> <p>There are shoes everywhere \u2013 I&#xa0;own about 200 pairs and my boyfriend about 30 \u2013 particularly trainers: we kick them off when we get home and leave them lying around. Cycle helmets, leads, adaptors, lamps, bags, folding chairs, bottled water are all out on show because there's hardly any storage and they don't have homes.</p> <p>I can't let go of things. I buy a lot of clothes, and sometimes get given them, but I've still got things from when I was 16, too. I wear them all \u2013 I don't just hold on to things for sentimental reasons. I probably buy one pair of shoes a month, a couple of dresses, the odd vintage piece. But sometimes I'll order stuff online and it will all arrive at once. I'm good at finding stuff in my wardrobe, despite what it looks like. I can be dressed in five minutes. I&#xa0;reach the top shelves on the ladder.</p> <p>The kitchen is filled with empty jars and bottles: if something looks nice, I'll keep it. I take after my mum \u2013 she's got hundreds of jam jars.</p> <p>We've adapted well to the space. We have shelving filled with books, magazines, invitations, press releases, handwritten notes. A&#xa0;wonky plastic trolley in the living room/kitchen keeps the door open, which makes the room feel bigger, and stores my papers.</p> <p>The flat has high ceilings and lots of light, so it feels larger. There's almost too much light \u2013 it glares off my computer screen and wakes me up early. My boyfriend has started working at home, too, so it can get a&#xa0;bit cramped. But my work takes me away a lot.</p> <p>Even if I had a massive place, I'd&#xa0;never be a minimalist: I'd accumulate more. I hate the idea of neat cupboards with things hidden away, out of sight. I'm never going to be ultra tidy \u2013 but the upside of that is, I've never not been able to find something. The flat's too small for anything to be truly lost.</p>",
  "<p>I do it every day, sometimes 20 to 30 times. I move from shop to shop, taking what I need, what I don't need. As long as I come away with something, I'm OK. On a bad day, I rack up hundreds of pounds' worth of clothes, makeup, food and jewellery. The more I get, the better the high.</p> <p>I've done it thousands of times, but I've been caught only a few. I'm&nbsp;not proud. I know it's wrong and&nbsp;I feel awful about it. Just not enough to stop. I used to put it down to greed, but it feels like more than that. It's an addiction. If I'm feeling stressed, it's like pulling a&nbsp;trigger and the next minute I'm in a shop putting stuff in my bag to make me feel better.</p> <p>Friends who find out what I do are shocked. I don't drink or do drugs; I have a degree, dress nicely, carry myself well. But I see it as my private thing, my release. It's my way of self-soothing, like a security blanket, which in turn becomes a sort of self-harming, a way of confirming in my own mind that I'm&nbsp;a bad person.</p> <p>It all started when I was a&nbsp;toddler. My mother used to steal in front of me and my sisters \u2013 her little girls would all watch, not knowing that what she was doing was wrong. One of my first memories is of her taking food from supermarkets: steak, expensive joints of lamb. She wouldn't try to conceal it. My dad would do it, too, for no reason. They never needed to, they both worked, but I suppose they enjoyed the risk.</p> <p>As a child, I felt I led a double life. At school I was intelligent, popular and funny; I would make people laugh. At home I was miserable. My&nbsp;parents argued and I would have to listen to their problems. I felt isolated from my sisters, who were much younger than me.</p> <p>I didn't have much pocket money, so I would shoplift and give things to&nbsp;friends. As a child, you know stealing isn't allowed, but after what I had witnessed, it seemed normal to&nbsp;me. Confusingly, my parents were&nbsp;moral in other ways \u2013 they worked hard and taught us to pull together as a family \u2013 but stealing was a big weakness, and they passed it on to me.</p> <p>When my parents split up, the stealing increased. It got me through university, kept me ticking over financially. Then it started to become more compulsive; I would feel the urge rising in me, the need to go to the nearest shopping centre and pinch.</p> <p>What I decide to steal doesn't really make sense to me; most of it I never use. Fake tan, for instance \u2013 I've taken more than 250 bottles of the stuff over the years, and never once used it. They're all lined up at home, unopened. It's all connected to the way I feel at the time. I&nbsp;take the tanning lotion when I'm disappointed in myself, so the bottles have stacked up. I have a pile of costume jewellery, too. I&nbsp;don't know why. It's all down to this awful habit I have of hating myself. If my mood is low, if I'm anxious or I've had an argument, these are the times I'll really go for it.</p> <p>While I'm stealing, I feel almost euphoric but also disconnected, as if I'm dreaming or someone else is doing it. This feeling will last for a&nbsp;while, but then a dread realisation kicks in and my mood plunges. I'm painfully aware what I do is wrong, yet I feel I have very little control.</p> <p>Things escalated after my partner&nbsp;left me for another woman. The feelings of rejection and anger created a void, one that I filled with&nbsp;more stealing. At my lowest, when I&nbsp;felt most depressed and detached, I would shoplift all day on&nbsp;autopilot.</p> <p>I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; the symptoms can include feelings of emptiness and impulsive behaviour. It&nbsp;is a&nbsp;relief at least to have an explanation for my behaviour.</p> <p>I've been caught three times, and&nbsp;on my last court appearance I&nbsp;was given&nbsp;a conditional discharge. The magistrate said he would give me one more chance. If I'm caught again, I will go to prison, which I just can't face.</p> <p>I've started counselling now and have been given a mentor and a&nbsp;social worker. I'm working towards a maths qualification and for the first time I feel inspired to stop. I&nbsp;believe my addiction is treatable, even though I'll probably always have to fight the urge. I've never been offered anything like this before and I'm learning that I'm not all bad. I can be helped.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Jill Clark</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<h2><strong>How can I manage my&#xa0;unpredictable, chaotic workload?</strong></h2> <p><strong>My job goes from feast to famine, with barely any work and then so much that my head spins and I struggle to cope. My facilities manager was off sick for two months and as his second in command, I have had to do a lot of his work. He has returned, but my workload is extremely heavy, mainly because we have unpredictable short-notice projects.</strong></p> <p><strong>I feel overwhelmed. The way things are running seems chaotic. There is nobody in a senior role I can speak to. I want to be acknowledged in a meaningful way for my work, rather than them just giving me so much to do.</strong></p> <p><strong>There are only so many hours I can work; higher-paid projects often go to others, so they make similar money while working fewer hours (I am paid on an hourly \u2013 plus project fees \u2013 basis, rather than salaried). I do have quite a few unavoidable commitments outside work but I am very professional and concerned I cannot spend enough time on things. I want to meet with my bosses to talk about a possible pay rise but everyone is so busy and stressed, including me. I don't know what to do.</strong></p> <p><strong> Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Chaos, particularly at work, can not only be self-perpetuating, but self-spawning: the effect of chaos can be to create yet more chaos. Everyone is so distracted that there's never enough time to work out what needs to be done, let alone put it into practice. That's clearly what's happening to you and your workplace. (I'm a bit puzzled, though, by your opening. At the moment there doesn't seem to be much famine about and all too much feast.)</p> <p>The only way to break this vicious circle is for someone with authority to say 'Stop! We've got to find time to Stop and Think'. The trouble is, your bosses appear to be as overwhelmed by work as you are \u2013 with the result that you hesitate to raise the matter.</p> <p>The longer you hesitate, the worse things will get. It won't be popular; people don't like being prompted to do what they already know they should have done \u2013 particularly when the immediate effect will be to increase stress and pressure rather than ease it \u2013 but you must.</p> <p>Before you do so, however, be sure you've got your own affairs in as organised a state as possible. I'm a little wary about your comment that you \"have quite a few unavoidable commitments outside work\". Any recommendation from you that workloads and work practices need a fundamental reassessment will be badly undermined \u2013 and all too easy to ignore \u2013 if your own work patterns are disorganised.</p> <p>Two final points. When you succeed in your request for a meeting with your bosses to ask for such a reappraisal, do be sure to include some practical and positive suggestions. They may not all be adopted, but it's essential you show an interest in solving problems rather than simply highlighting them. And second, please don't confuse this meeting by introducing the thought of a possible pay rise. That comes later \u2013 when, all being well, you'll have demonstrated that you deserve one.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It sounds as if you're not suited&#xa0;to multi-project/programme roles. Start looking for a contract role, where you can at least have a say in the nature of the work you take on. <strong>JulesMaigret</strong></p> <p>\u2022 If you are an employee but paid on an hourly rate with others on a different package you can ask to have that addressed. But be careful, as you were obviously taken on to deal with the work you are doing now and maybe your company values the flexible way that they employ you. The minute you want more structure and support, in this market, they may seek that elsewhere. Can you bring order to the chaos by working in a more structured way? Can you ask for more flexibility during the busy periods so you can have some downtime during the quiet times? <strong>ExBrightonBelle</strong></p> <h2><strong>Is the IT sector a safe haven in these insecure times?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I am deliberating over a career change. I am 27, have a degree in information and library management, and have worked in the NHS as an information specialist for four-and-a-half years. My issue is that I never really wanted to be an information specialist and I find the work quite boring (although I am incredibly grateful for a permanent and secure job in these times).</strong></p> <p><strong>I am thinking of a career change to work in IT, possibly in information systems (I feel that my background would help with this) or programming. I am not certain what exactly, but think the information and communications technology sector, somewhere. I would have to do a master's in order to make this career change.</strong></p> <p><strong>Would this be a smart move? Is there a lot of competition for IT roles; indeed are there any jobs? What if I do the master's and don't get a job? What if I hate working in IT?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>There are always IT roles out there \u2013 and there's always plenty of competition for them. But I don't think that's how you should be directing your thoughts \u2013 at least not immediately. You need more clarity. Contemplating the ICT sector as a whole won't help much: it's a vast and disparate industry in demand by, and increasingly essential to, just about every sort of enterprise. It's the uses to which ICT is put that can make the difference between satisfying and unrewarding work.</p> <p>You've already spent four and a half years doing a job, not because you wanted to do it but because it was there. At 27, you really mustn't make the same mistake again.</p> <p>Knowing so little about you, I find it impossible to point you in any specific direction. Only you can know what gets your interest going. But until you identify what that is, and set your unrelenting sights on doing it, I strongly urge you to stay in your undemanding job. To leave yourself both jobless and directionless would be unwise.</p> <p>But please set yourself a time limit; as you know only too well, it's all too easy to postpone difficult decisions from one day to the next; from one week to the next; from one month to the next: until four and a half years have somehow disappeared \u2013 and with very little to show for it.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 There are a lot of open source projects you could get involved in. This will give you a good idea of whether you enjoy software development and will also give you something to put on your CV to compensate for a lack of other IT experience. <strong>Barry841</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Look at moving into information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) or service management roles, where you can apply your previous experience. You can obtain qualifications in ITIL with relatively small outlay (many employers will support such training as they want to be \"ITIL compliant\"). You don't need to do a master's degree.

You already know this: giving someone a red rose, rather than a&#xa0;sunflowery,&#xa0;says something quite particular; and a daisy chain around your neck sends a&#xa0;very different message from a camellia on your lapel. The&#xa0;Victorians, never ones to let emotion and instinct rule when they could make everything overcomplicated and tortured instead, turned floriography into a complex secret code: a solid colour carnation meant yes, a striped one no. But the fundamentals of the language are deep-rooted and intuitive to most of us. Rosemary for remembrance, snowdrops for hope.</p> <p>So there's no logic in thinking of flowers as a uniform category in fashion: in general, they simply stand for femininity, which doesn't narrow it down at all, because femininity is as broad a church as they come. Each type of floral says something different. But \u2013 and this is why designers love them \u2013 they set mood music, rather than spelling out their message. A bright, naive daisy motif can be sunny and uncomplicated or late-60s psychedelic, depending on how you use it. Spriggy, muted florals can be Little House On The Prairie or Bloomsbury Set, depending on how they're coloured and cut, and on the wearer's hairstyle. There is room for ambiguity and nuance of the kind you just can't achieve with a slogan T-shirt.</p> <p>So I offer no apology for \"defining\" this season's headline floral as Vaguely Oriental. Designers are currently drawn to peonies and chrysanthemums, often on black backgrounds. Fashion in general has shifted from peppy, clean-lined minimalism to something darker and more gothic but still elegant. The Vaguely Oriental floral is in line with this. It is slightly unfamiliar, and a restrained, slightly sombre beauty; timeless, rather than retro.</p> <p>There is another reason the Vaguely Oriental floral feels right for now. This picture was taken indoors, a while ago; by the time you read this, we will be firmly into black tights season, and a print with a black background is an easier fit with dark hosiery. The language of flowers and femininity may be complex, but this is a point we all understand.</p> <p>\u2022 Jess wears <strong>dress</strong>, \u00a3865, by Jonathan Saunders, from <a href=\"http://www.matchesfashion.com\" title=\"\">matchesfashion.com</a>. <strong>Shoes</strong><em>, </em>\u00a3325, by Paul &amp; Joe, 020-7824 8844.</p> <p>Styling: Lucy Trott at Carol Hayes Management.

  "<p>You'll have seen this one around the place. It looks, at first glance anyway, a little bit like a Bentley from the front. But then the more you see of it, and the more you&#xa0;look, the less like a Bentley it becomes. It's brasher, louder, cheaper, more American. Actually, on this, the car's second incarnation, the grille is less like a Bentley's; it's been replaced by a more American one. The car has lost some of its distinguished looks.</p> <p>It is still distinctive, though, with its high sides and squat windows, there's a certain badassness about it, the kind of car you can possibly imagine a Chicago gangster driving, or cruising along The Strip in Vegas. Maybe the rear window lowers, the muzzle of a semi-automatic weapon appears, pow pow pow, the window is raised as the car speeds off to the sound and smell of burning rubber...</p> <p>Here, parked on my Victorian London terrace, it just looks ridiculous. It <em>is</em> ridiculous, and it's embarrassing. It's too big, it doesn't fit. And it's too big driving around town, too. It's vast, a proper tank.</p> <p>On the open road it makes a&#xa0;bit more sense \u2013 powerful, easy, comfortable, big. You get a real sense of momentum in it, the feeling it will carry on, for ever, in a straight line, on a straight road\u2026 in America, where it belongs. And where this kind of vulgarity is acceptable. And where the 28th amendment to the constitution protects an individual's right to burn oil, no matter what the&#xa0;cost to the planet.</p> <p>OK, so in Europe it comes with a V6 diesel engine, but even so it's a lot thirstier and CO<sub>2</sub> fartier than the equivalent European (probably German) diesel luxo barge. The German will be a better car, too, more suited to Europe's roads, and&#xa0;more refined inside.</p> <p>So all the Chrysler really has going&#xa0;for it is its style. But looks alone aren't enough to keep a relationship going. Especially when they're not as striking as the&#xa0;previous model's. And when they don't stand up to closer scrutiny. Look at it, it's not really as badass as it thinks it is, is it? I don't believe any self-respecting gangster would really want to be seen dead (maybe literally) in one of these. No&#xa0;rapper either, or footballer, just as they wouldn't want to have a fake gold Rolex on their wrist.</p> <p>Because that's what this car is, a&#xa0;fake. And if you're going to not give a toss about the environment, you may as well do it&#xa0;in style.

  "<p>Midway through the 19th century, when the government of France set out to build Europe's most impressive railway system, there wasn't much doubt about how to do it: start in Paris, and build tracks in straight lines radiating outwards. \"What a fine role for the state,\" the system's designer, Victor Legrand, rhapsodised, \"if it can take charge and plan the main lines \u2026 and by this means of rapid, long-distance communications bring about the full integration of our fine country.\" But in crucial ways the \"Legrand Star\", as it came to be known, was a disaster. When war broke out with Prussia in 1870, Bismarck was able to transport nearly twice as many troops to the front as France, because Prussia's railways were a decentralised, unplanned hodgepodge of country lines; every French soldier, by contrast, had to travel via Paris. In the parlance of network theory, the Prussian system had \"redundancy\": multiple pathways to the same destination. The Prussians, you may remember, won that war.</p> <p>The internet is the modern decentralised network par excellence, which helps to explain why the Silicon Valley air carries the distinct aroma of libertarianism. Many web entrepreneurs seem to view themselves as individualist frontiersmen on the unregulated plains of cyberspace, albeit with high-end mountain bikes. An extreme example is Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, who dreams of escaping the burdens of government entirely by establishing <a href=\"http://www.seasteading.org/\" title=\"\">a floating autonomous ocean colony, or \"seastead\"</a>.</p> <p>But this identification of progress with free-market libertarianism, the technology writer Steven Johnson contends, is as mistaken as Legrand-style central planning. Real progress, he argues in <em>Future Perfect</em>, emerges from \"peer networks\" such as the internet because they're open and collaborative, not because of private, profit-motivated competition. His book is a call to support what he presents as a new kind of politics, based neither on traditional left-wing ideas of big government nor traditional right-wing ideas of big markets. \"We believe in social progress, and we believe the most powerful tool to advance the cause of progress is the peer network,\" he writes, describing himself and his fellow-thinkers. \"We are peer progressives.\"</p> <p>This kind of declaration, coupled with Johnson's gung-ho title, is liable to induce a sinking feeling: is this another tract by a cyber-utopian, convinced that the web will solve all human ills? In the wake of the Arab revolutions of 2010 and 2011, for example, we've been subjected to a remarkably tedious argument about the role that social networks such as Twitter played in the unseating of dictators. Cyber-utopians argue that they made all the difference; mirror-image cyber-curmudgeons argue that they were irrelevant. But what normal person seriously doubts that the answer is \"somewhere in between\"? Johnson, refreshingly, is uninterested in such debates. The point about peer progressivism, he makes clear, is that it takes the internet not as a cure-all, but as a model. (And not the only model: the trading towns of the early renaissance were peer networks, too.) \"A growing number of us,\" he writes, \"have started to think that the core principles that governed the design of the net could be applied to solve different kinds of problems \u2013 the problems that confront neighbourhoods, artists, drug companies, parents, schools.\" These solutions are as likely to emerge from outside the market as within it; the internet itself, after all, was created not by some Thiel-esque superman, but by government-funded collaborations between academics and the military. Besides, private corporations can become Legrand Stars as easily as states. Even Facebook, on the inside, \"prefers top-down control centralised in a charismatic leader\".</p> <p>What might a \"peer progressive\" world look like? Consider the ordinary challenges of an urban neighbourhood: potholes, noise pollution, broken street lights, empty wasteland. There are already numerous \"crowdsourced\" systems for alerting local councils to such problems, including <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/apps/311/\" title=\"\">New York's pioneering 311 phone line</a>, or the splendidly named Australian website <a href=\"http://mashupaustralia.org/mashups/its-buggered-mate/\" title=\"\">It's Buggered Mate</a>. But what if residents were also empowered to spend a portion of their taxes on solving those problems, through a \"crowdfunding\" network modelled on the website Kickstarter? Members of the community \u2013 residents' groups, local builders, landscape gardeners \u2013 could propose improvement projects, and members of the community could collaborate to decide which ones to fund. This system of \"participatory budgeting\", similar to an approach already used in some parts of Brazil, doesn't count as big government: it shuns central planning, drawing wisdom instead from the edges of the network. But it isn't small government, either: it doesn't involve slashing taxes, nor a \"Big Society\"-style reliance on volunteers. It's a networked form of direct democracy \u2013 not the herd mentality of government-by-referendum, but a fine-grained, ongoing response to daily problems.</p> <p>The principle could be extended, Johnson suggests, to election campaign financing. Perhaps we don't have to choose between centralised state funding and a free-market free-for-all. Why not give citizens the right to spend, say, \u00a350 of what they've already paid in tax, in an election year, to the candidate or party of their choice?</p> <p>Even in the world of commerce, the book shows, collaborative peer networks outperform free-market arrangements all the time. Johnson celebrates a resurgence of interest in \"prize-backed challenges\", funded by governments or private individuals, similar to the one that famously led to the solving of the problem of longitude. The best hopes for everything from a cure for Aids to viable private spaceflight may lie in such schemes. It is a central premise of such challenges that the resulting knowledge be shared, so that the network's \"hive mind\" can implement and improve it. The pure market approach would be to protect it with a patent. This is a key distinction between libertarians and peer progressives: many libertarians love patents. \"All of that emphasis on freedom,\" Johnson writes, \"vanishes when intellectual property is on the table.\"</p> <p>There are still traces, in <em>Future Perfect</em>, of the cyber-utopianism that its title might imply; for example, Johnson never fully explains how his vision of networked democracy would avoid the perils of what Alexis de Tocqueville called \"the tyranny of the majority\". His brief mention of climate change, on the other hand, suggests that peer progressivism might not be able to solve the most pressing challenge of all. But the book is a wide-ranging sketch of possibilities, not a detailed policy prescription, and read as such, it's frequently inspiring. Above all, it's exciting to reflect on the possibility that the many achievements of the Silicon Valley revolution might be compatible, rather than in tension, with a progressive focus on social justice and participatory democracy. But then I always suspected that Peter Thiel's confidence in the power of the free market to devise the most elegant solutions to everything was misplaced.

The author is particularly interesting on the history of medicine (his own field), and makes some intriguing wider sociological arguments: eg that international meetings, which became possible in the mid-19th century thanks to trains and steamships, helped create modern chemistry. He heaps praise on many obscurer names as well as the usual suspects, including the Islamic scholar <a href=\"http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ibn_Muadh_BEA.htm\" title=\"\">Ibn Mu'adh</a>, who in the 11th century hit on a brilliant scheme for estimating the height of the atmosphere.</p> <p>Bynum invites you warmly to imagine how \"hard it was\" to reconstruct dinosaurs from their bones; to appreciate that bygone scientists \"dressed, ate and thought like other people at the time\"; and to be forgiving of historic errors.

Despite the fact that it's pious men who tend to grab the headlines, it seems that fewer men overall have religious belief. With a modest patience (apologising at one point for \"a dull but necessary theoretical note\"), the authors of this tight and interesting little book collect the evidence on religions old and new, noting exceptions (women are a minority in Hare Krishna and Children of God), and offering an overview of scholarly explanations of the \"gender gap\".</p> <p>Did the female-led 19th-century revivalist movements of the US allow \"women to curb male sexual demands\"? Does the modern New Age \"holistic spirituality milieu\" offer an \"entrepreneurial world\" in which women have the \"freedom to innovate\"? Across various religions, the authors emphasise, women can \"self-govern\" and \"ignore or subvert what they do not like\". In modern, secularising societies, the gender gap closes as interest falls off everywhere, which the authors take as cause for cautious optimism. But then who will save us from the laws of thermodynamics?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397902716\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2012/10/17/1350482253907/Muhammad-All-That-Matters.jpg\" alt=\"Ziauddin Sardar, Muhammad: All That Matters\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ziauddin Sardar, Muhammad: All That Matters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Muhammad: All That Matters</strong> by Ziauddin Sardar (Hodder, \u00a37.99)<br>\"Despite contemporary claims,\" we read here rather topically, \"there is no law against blaspheming Muhammad\"; the Qur'an advises rather that one should turn the other cheek to scoffers. In his mini-biography of the prophet, Sardar seeks to rebut \"orientalist\" and \"revisionist\" scholarship while also cutting through later accretions of legend designed to \"provide a sanctimonious aura\" around his subject. The aim is to portray Muhammad as \"a rational, thinking individual\" as well as a (mostly) kind and gentle one. Sardar describes well the complex factional politics in Mecca and Medina, and emphasises the brevity (and historical normality) of Muhammad's military escapades, as well as his love of dates and perfume.</p> <p>I was particularly happy to read this prettily humanising story: \"Muhammad adored cats. Once he cut a hole in a robe he was wearing so that he could remove a sleeping cat without disturbing it.\" You see, cats always come out on top: they can even turn entropy to their advantage.</p>",
  "<p>Despite being surrounded from an early age by the usual trappings of advanced rock'n'roll hedonism, particularly after his album <em>Harvest</em> became the best seller of 1972, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung\" title=\"\">Neil Young</a> has never been your average rock star, and this not your average rock star autobiography. There is a little bit of weed and cocaine \u2013 quite a lot, actually, but not flaunted, as it were, under the reader's nose \u2013 and some discussion of guitars and the occasional backstage tantrum, but rather more about his son Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic, and his own childhood polio and the brain aneurism that attacked him in 2005.</p> <p>Young is a natural obsessive and a bit cantankerous, which makes an interesting combination. Unlike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/music/9780743478649/chronicles-v\" title=\"\"><em>Chronicles: Volume One</em></a><em> </em>seemed intent on telling the real story, albeit with embellishments and occlusions, he seems uncertain of the core purpose of the project. Young stopped drinking and smoking shortly before starting to write, and it may be that the book represents a sort of displacement therapy. But those drawn over the last half-century to his high, strained voice and doggedly affecting ballads will find plenty here to flesh out their portrait of a man who prefers amplifiers with valves and cars with carburettors, and resents the way today's music is marketed \"like a cool pastime or a toy, not a message to the soul\".</p> <p>Having grown up watching his father, a prominent journalist and broadcaster in Canada, tapping out columns for Toronto's Globe and Mail on a typewriter, he has declined to avail himself of a ghostwriter's services. His distinctly unplugged prose can plod along in an artless, ruminative sort of way, or it can \u2013 very occasionally \u2013 take wing. The style turns out to be as unpredictable a combination of awkwardness and grace as his music, lurching from sudden insights \u2013 \"the muse has no conscience\", he notes, meditating on his readiness to do the dirty work of firing colleagues who fail to meet his standards \u2013 to the occasional aside of such startling banality that the reader pauses, searching in vain for a redeeming irony: \"California really is beautiful if you've never been there. It's worth a visit for sure.\" There are lots of exclamation marks, and even an \"OMG\", which sounds odd coming from the pen of a 66-year-old man.</p> <p>He begins by describing the act of unwrapping a present from his wife, a rare piece of vintage switchgear for the elaborate model train set he keeps at his principal home, the Broken Arrow Ranch, in northern California (there are other homes in Hawaii and Malibu). He built the train set many years ago with Ben, who is now in his mid-30s. Many of the associated items \u2013 locomotives, carriages, accessories \u2013 are kept in display cases, whose windows Young carefully polishes.</p> <p>A couple of pages later he is telling us about a pivotal moment in his life: his purchase of a 1953 Buick Skylark, a car he had desired since his childhood, after seeing one belonging to a friend of his father. \"It was brand-new and made a large impression on me,\" he writes, \"with its beautifully designed grille, tail-lights and an overall shape that featured a kind of bump or ripple in the lines at about the midpoint, accentuated by a chrome strip that mirrored it.\" The coveted Skylark became the centrepiece of a collection that eventually expanded to about 35 cars of character, many of which we meet at some point in his tale, as when he is taking his wife on a first date (baby-blue '49 Cadillac convertible), vainly searching for the location of the TV show <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77_Sunset_Strip\" title=\"\"><em>77 Sunset Strip</em></a> on a first trip to Los Angeles from his Canadian home ('53 Pontiac hearse), or cruising the Hollywood Hills between recording sessions for his first solo album ('34 Mulliner-bodied Bentley coupe).</p> <p>Soon he moves on to the two matters that seem to have become an even more pressing obsession, and on behalf of which the book occasionally turns into a propaganda vehicle. The first is an audio reproduction system called PureTone, with which he hopes to rescue the recording industry from the digitally compressed sound of the iPod. \"Today, music is presented as an entertainment medium, like a game, without the full audio quality,\" he writes. The second is the Lincvolt, an old Lincoln Continental adapted to run on electricity and ethanol with the intention of demonstrating to auto industry sceptics that if such a beast can be turned into an ecologically neutral device, then anything is possible. The Lincvolt's job is to rescue the planet.</p> <p>\"I put in the money to do it myself,\" he says of his projects, \"and do whatever I need to do to get the money, promise that I will deliver a record and get advances, anything I can do to get the cash to make something happen the way I envision it. So I get into a lot of trouble, although I also get a lot of things done.\"</p> <p>His relationship with the digital age provokes his most interesting meditation on his first-hand experience of changes in a musician's relationship with his work and his audience. \"Any experiment I try onstage is thrown up on YouTube, where people who think they know what I should be doing start shooting holes in it before it's even finished,\" he writes. \"This is the single most daunting challenge the internet has provided, along with all the good things. The stage used to be my lab, where I could experiment in front of a live audience and see how it reacted and \u2013 more important \u2013 how I felt while I was doing it \u2026 Now I try to work things out in private while I develop ideas. That way I have a chance to present the first time to a large audience. Unfortunately, that is not as adventuresome for me.\"</p> <p>None of this has much to do with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/crosbystillsnashandyoung\" title=\"\">David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash</a>, the three musicians with whom, in the early 1970s, he toured and recorded as part of what was probably the most popular (and high-earning) band of its time. They are dealt with in a handful of pages that end with a crisp explanation of a break-up largely rooted in his discontent: \"But then came the fame, the drugs, the money, houses, cars and admirers; then the solo albums \u2026 In the end, it became a celebration of ourselves, and there was no way to keep that going.\"</p> <p>For all Young's engagement with serious issues, <em>Waging Heavy Peace</em> is not without its reminders that he achieved his celebrity during an easily satirised time of excessive reward and immoderate self-indulgence. When an aide calls to break the news that his beloved customised tour bus, known as Pocahontas, has caught fire and burnt out, he has its remains conveyed to his ranch and buried in a eucalyptus grove.</p>",
  "<p>C\u00e9zanne demands of us. Like no one else's, his paintings push and pull at our vision. His mountains seen through trees and his tabletops of apples upset our notions of \"here\" and of \"there\", of light, matter and distance: what constitutes a feeling and what an object get radically spun about. C\u00e9zanne's art is giddying and heady, a charge of magnetic energy sent through shapes and colours to regroup them in strange new harmonies: the world looks different as you walk away. Allen Ginsberg, quoted in Alex Danchev's new biography, <em>Cezanne: A Life </em>(Profile, \u00a330), described its effects as \"eyeball kicks\". Although this painter was a school of one, resembling no one else, few painters could work the same way again after taking in what he had been doing. Here is the man who more than any other set 20th-century painting on its course.</p> <p>And yet this messiah of modernism has always \u2013 from his youth in the 1860s, down to the present \u2013 appeared a misfit. If his way of representing things is strong, on certain levels it also seems wrong. This is not the world we normally move about in, it's some alternative plane of experience made solely possible by paint. To reach for it, so people have thought, C\u00e9zanne must have been in the grip of an obsession \u2013 some disturbance, some malfunction. Such reactions came not only from casual observers confused by his boorish manners and dismayed that he didn't draw \"straight\". It was C\u00e9zanne that<a href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/the-novel-which-emile-zola-portrayed-his-friends-2850845.html\" title=\"\"> Zola, his old school friend from Aix-en-Provence</a>, had largely in mind when he wrote a novel about an artist doomed to failure by \"heroic madness\" and defective vision. In fact the cues for this could have come from C\u00e9zanne himself. \"I am a primitive, I have a lazy eye,\" he would protest in his later years. He was afflicted by \"brain trouble\" and was \"no longer my own master\".</p> <p>Danchev's new life \u2013 original, engaging and highly persuasive \u2013 brushes aside that line in pathos, likewise refusing the \"profitless psychoanalysis\" that many a distinguished interpreter has applied to the artist. The problems of C\u00e9zanne, Danchev argues, were of his own conscious choosing. An ambitious and well read young Proven\u00e7al, coming to Paris just as a new art scene was coalescing around <a href=\"http://www.theartstory.org/movement-impressionism.htm\" title=\"\">Manet</a>, began pretty early to stake out his own independent path. \"In the mid-1860s, at the age of about 25, C\u00e9zanne set about becoming C\u00e9zanne.\" Socially, that involved developing a sardonic, forbidding crust, posing as a querulous hick from the sticks. (On being introduced to the dapper maestro of modern painting: \"I won't offer you my hand, Monsieur Manet, I haven't washed for a week.\")</p> <p>Intellectually, it meant taking seriously France's leading philosopher of the day, <a href=\"http://www.nndb.com/people/388/000098094/\" title=\"\">Hippolyte Taine</a>, who wrote that real art came about through \"sensation\" driving the brain \"to rethink and transform the object, sometimes to illuminate and elevate, sometimes to twist and distort.\" What was this \"sensation\"? Perhaps it meant the impulses of lust and violence C\u00e9zanne's early paintings often featured; perhaps it was the rhythmic intuition about two dimensional relationships that literally distorts the dinner-plates and the Monts-Sainte-Victoire in his later work. \"I have very strong sensations,\" C\u00e9zanne would remark. In Danchev's account, that becomes a boast that the painter requires himself to live up to, a persona to inhabit: \"Performing C\u00e9zanne became one of his best turns.\" The tale is largely of how the role expanded and deepened, spurring him on to prod at strange new faultlines in the field of vision and, in the decade before his death in 1906, to act as guru to a select few listeners come to seek him out in his Proven\u00e7al lair. Also, of how he \"immatured with age\", as Danchev puts it, letting his self-appointed wildness take over the reins. We hear of a neighbour covertly watching him as he puzzled over a Mont-Sainte-Victoire: \"He seemed to be all out of sorts ... Do you know what he did? He picked up a big rock and threw it right through the middle of the canvas!\"</p> <p>The tale largely turns on these considerations because, outwardly, it is far from incident-packed. C\u00e9zanne pursuing his 19th-century research project more resembles a gentleman scientist such as Darwin than<a href=\"http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ma-Mo/Monet-Claude.html#b\" title=\"\"> struggling contemporaries such as Monet</a>, in that his father, a leading banker in Aix, ensured he was never dependent on sales. He could thus could face down a critical indifference that lasted until his late 50s. Old Louis C\u00e9zanne, it is true, halved the allowance when he found out that up in Paris, the nearly 40-year-old Paul had long been keeping a common-law wife and their child. But this Hortense Fiquet is almost the only amatory interest in the artist's career, and although Danchev valiantly tries to see her in three dimensions, the evidence is just too slight to gain purchase \u2013 especially as she never looks the same from one depiction by her husband to the next. (As Danchev nicely puts it, \"A C\u00e9zanne portrait is more a thereness than a likeness.\")</p> <p>During C\u00e9zanne's financial contretemps with his father, it was Zola, the schoolfellow turned literary celeb, who stepped in with loans. It's long been assumed that this friendship of C\u00e9zanne's \u2013 surely \"the main axis of his emotional life\" \u2013 was betrayed and decisively broken when Zola published his melodrama about an artist doomed by \"heroic madness\". But again Danchev is intent to read the evidence more subtly. He portrays a more gradual divergence, ending with in one corner a political loudmouth, hosting suppers in his flash mansion outside Paris, while in the other a no less proud recluse shunts canvases in and out of a self-designed studio on the outskirts of Aix, keeping his distance even from his own wife and son.</p> <p>With relatively little to work with dramatically, Danchev creates his C\u00e9zanne by a method that in less capable hands would seem outrageous. He assembles him out of emotions gathered from other people's lives. How did C\u00e9zanne feel about his father? Let's read what Kafka had to say about his own. For C\u00e9zanne's sense of self-worth, go to Val\u00e9ry writing about Stendhal. A Beckett short story gives us an angle on the eventual marriage to Hortense; while Flaubert can voice whatever disdain the artist felt for critics, the bourgeois and his fellow Proven\u00e7als. Equally, the paintings come to life as they have lived in others' eyes. Ginsberg's poetic witness is joined by Heaney, Walcott and Rilke, whose letters about a 1907 C\u00e9zanne retrospective remain more vivid than anything written about the paintings since. Stan Brakhage, Giacometti and Heidegger all put in a word. In fact, Danchev seems to report back from some cultural meta-space in which high artistic achievements in every medium and from every era interconnect.</p> <p>Why should we trust him to do so? First, because his own prose is so witty, mobile and sensitive: second, because to a lay reader it seems grounded in long and thoughtful study of the primary sources; third, because that study brings out how committed a reader C\u00e9zanne himself was, a devotee of poetry from Virgil to Baudelaire. This feeds Danchev's argument that the imagination of this alleged obsessive was \"richer than is generally realised, and rather less strange\". Confident of his material, Danchev paces around the chronology fairly freely, pursuing whatever line of thought engages him, genially holding the stage.</p> <p>Trying to close in on C\u00e9zanne's landscapes and still lives from the years before his death at 67, the approach does hit a limit. In the face of those uniquely momentous arguments between eyesight and the world, one instinct tells Danchev to pile up appreciations and circumstantial data \u2013 his peroration expires in a scattershot of lists \u2013 and another, more wisely, to submit to silence. Seeing beyond the outward man, the supposed fractured sociopath, he would like to relay the substance of the painter who undertook to deliver \"truth\" in his art: \"C\u00e9zanne's truth may be more important than C\u00e9zanne's doubt.\" But that truth is for showing, not telling. These pages reach their highpoint with a photo of an old man in a hat and tatty jacket, standing between a country wall and a tripod easel, brush poised before the canvas, eyes staring out. Transfixed, Danchev's happy eloquence for once stutters to a stop. \"He is painting. This is it.\".</p>",
  "<p>As far as Emma Donoghue is concerned, her best days are behind her. Until the age of 40, her literary career had been characterised chiefly by moderation: steady sales, mild misfortunes (a pair of novels that sold in North America but not in the UK or Ireland), a sturdy critical reputation built on books that fossicked odd details from the historical record and sculpted them into smart narratives. Then, in 2010, she published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780330519014/room\" title=\"\"><em>Room</em></a> \u2013 a novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/13/emma-donoghue-room-josef-fritzl\" title=\"\">\"triggered by\" the case of Josef Fritzl</a>, the Austrian man who locked his daughter in a basement for 24 years, raped her repeatedly and fathered her seven children. Overnight, Donoghue was pitched into the stratosphere. The book \u2013 in which five-year-old Jack and his Ma spin out their days in a tiny shed, access to the wider world limited to the TV screen and the nightly visits of their captor \u2013 touched off a bidding war, scaled the international bestseller lists, hit the Man Booker and Orange prize shortlists and was praised to the skies by critics on both sides of the Atlantic (\"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/10-best-books-of-2010.html\" title=\"\">one of the pure triumphs of recent fiction</a>\", according to the New York Times). And Donoghue is cheerfully resigned to the fact that she'll never see the like of it again.</p> <p>\"I'm fully expecting things to gently decline,\" she says, when we meet in Dublin (she's in town for the opening night of her play about the life of New Yorker journalist <a href=\"http://www.dublintheatrefestival.com/programme/display.asp?Eventid=622\" title=\"\">Maeve Brennan</a>). \"I was aware that, conceptually, <em>Room</em> was the strongest book I'd written; I could see that even though it was a creepy set-up, people would care about it. But it was a one-off for me. I feel my career peaked, and that's OK! Better than not to peak at all, and it'd be a shame if that great experience were to embitter me. I'd almost 20 years of publishing beforehand; that to me is the norm and I'm happy to return to it.\"</p> <p>Certainly with her latest book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781447209492/astray\" title=\"\"><em>Astray</em></a>, a collection of 14 short stories based on real events, she's back on home turf. Set in the raw early days of the New World, <em>Astray</em> picks its way across a continent in the process of imagining itself into being, via the off-kilter lives of the chancers and misfits who find themselves trying to survive there. There's the teenage conscript coerced into militarised rape during the war of independence, the gang who hatch a plan to ransom Lincoln's corpse, the 19th-century New York politico discovered after death to have been a woman, the hard-drinking, cross-dressing cowgirl who metes out blunt justice in 1870s Arizona. You couldn't make this stuff up, and Donoghue hasn't: each story is postscripted with a run-down of the facts, scant as they are; a line in a letter, a newspaper report. These fragments furnish their own pleasures, both revealing the stitchwork that tacks fact and fiction together and hinting at the rich, full lives that lie behind the stories.</p> <p>\"I'd never start with the facts,\" Donoghue says, \"that would be too much like a history lesson. But I had to put them in. I come out of an academic background, and I'm aware that what I'm doing is simultaneously research and fiction. I want to meet both those obligations. Plus, ethically, I don't own these cases: I'm drawing on the scholarship of others and the lives of the dead. None of this is my pure invention.\"</p> <p>Her particular subjects also impose their own demands. \"I got into all this doing a PhD in 18th-century literature, when I became interested in revisionism,\" Donoghue explains. \"Who was left out of history? Well, primarily, women. But look at the history of everyday life and you find that most people are left out: the women lead you to their equivalently obscure male family members, then you come to the freaks and cripples and slaves \u2013 not just downtrodden, but treated as not fully real people. If you're writing a novel about Henry VIII, you don't have to say what you've fictionalised, because it's easy to check; Henry VIII doesn't need you to speak up about your sources. But Mollie Sanger, my doughty&#xa0;cowgirl&#xa0;\u2013 if I don't put her on the record she's not on it at all. And I'm so grateful to her and all of them for the good stories.\"</p> <p>Donoghue was born in Dublin in 1969, the daughter of teachers (her mother taught English at secondary school, her father is the literary critic <a href=\"http://english.as.nyu.edu/object/DenisDonoghue.html\" title=\"\">Denis Donoghue)</a> and the youngest of eight (<em>Astray</em> is dedicated to her siblings). \"It was splendid,\" she says, of her crowded childhood. \"There was always company; I liked the buzz. You're meant to have an unhappy childhood to be a writer, but there's a lot to be said for a very happy one that just let's you get on with it.\" She attended convent school until the age of nine, when her father, then a professor at University College Dublin, was offered a job at New York University. \"I had this one dazzling year in the US,\" she says, \"and it opened my eyes. Ireland was terribly homogenous and old-fashioned at the time, so New York blew me away. I saw black people! And more exotic yet, divorced people! It made me more confident, more aware of a wider world. And of course as soon as I realised I was gay, I told myself 'I want a wider&#xa0;world!'\"</p> <p>Definitive recognition of her sexuality came at the age of 14, and coincided with a determination to write. \"It's not that one caused the other,\" she says, \"but I got more serious about it then. It's that introspective moment when you're suddenly fascinated by yourself, which fits perfectly with writing and its inherent narcissism. In fact, one thing I like about historical fiction is that I'm not constantly focusing on me, or people like me; you're obliged to concentrate on lives that are completely other than your own.\"</p> <p>That's not to say she steers clear of the contemporary entirely. \"My first two novels, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780140230833/stir-fry\" title=\"\"><em>Stirfry</em></a> and <a href=\"http://emmadonoghue.com/books/novels/hood.html\" title=\"\"><em>Hood</em></a>, are set in modern Dublin, and I do keep doubling back. Writing about the present day satisfies different desires. <em>Room</em> is contemporary but it felt like writing historical fiction, in that it's a completely different situation from any I've ever lived, but I took the stuff of my life then, which was raising small children \u2013 my son, Finn, was four when I got the idea \u2013 and put it in a far more dramatic context. The awful thing, though, is that if you use your life for fiction, afterwards you tend to remember the fiction better than the life, because you've gone over and over it. In <em>Hood</em>, for example, I drew a lot on convent school; one day I mentioned something about our school to my girlfriend at the time and she said 'No, Emma, that's from your book.' I didn't want that to happen with Finn, so I marked up a copy of <em>Room</em> with yellow highlighter to record which bits were based on him. There was yellow on every page.\"</p> <p>Donoghue has two children \u2013 Finn, now eight, and Una, five \u2013 with her partner Chris Roulston, a professor of women's studies at the University of Western Ontario. The pair met at Cambridge, where Donoghue was studying for a PhD; it was while engaged in research and kicking her heels in the British Library that she turned up the snippet that would lead to her first historical novel. \"In those days, the British Library used to take an age to deliver your books,\" she says. \"You'd go in and fill out your dockets in quadruplicate, and then you'd wait. I was killing time in the reading room and I pulled an encyclopaedia of Welsh women's history off the shelves. There was this one-paragraph summary of a girl executed for murder in 1763 who, when asked why she'd done it, said it was for love of fine clothes. And I thought, wow: I like a frock myself, but murder?\"</p> <p>That glancing insight into the violent and foreshortened life of a woman two centuries out of reach touched off the tale that would become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781844088201/slammerkin\" title=\"\"><em>Slammerkin</em></a>. From a single throwaway sentence, Donoghue works a glowing tapestry of 18th-century life: her protagonist Mary Saunders, bright, brittle and fatally damaged, flees London's stews for the Welsh border town of Monmouth, where she blags her way into the household of an embryonically middle-class family of dressmakers and rots them from the inside out like the proverbial worm in the bud. Published in 2000, <em>Slammerkin</em> \u2013 the word means both loose dress and loose woman \u2013 was Donoghue's breakthrough novel, in terms of both sales and subject. \"It was the first time I developed a voice for pre-modern stories,\" she says. \"I'd written a book of fairy tales, but with <em>Slammerkin</em> I jumped into the past with both feet.\" Initially, it wasn't the softest of landings; strange to imagine, in these post-<em>Wolf Hall</em> times, but in the late 1990s, historical fiction was still firmly in the shadows, and the book was a tough sell. Its success taught her \"never to attempt to second-guess the market\", and that in historical fiction, she'd found her m\u00e9tier.</p> <p>\"I love the oddity of historical incidence, the ethical muddiness,\" she says. \"You have to pick a universal story, one that people can identify with \u2013 you can't just set off writing about wage conditions in cotton factories. But what's wonderful are those moments when you suddenly reveal to the reader how completely different things were. Like in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781447205975/the-sealed-letter\" title=\"\"><em>The Sealed Letter</em></a>\" \u2013 her 2008 novel based on <a href=\"http://goodgentlewoman.wordpress.com/2012/09/15/the-codrington-divorce/\" title=\"\">a high-class divorce that galvanised 1860s London</a>, in which Helen Codrington, trapped in a stale marriage to a decent but stiff older husband, conducts a series of affairs and is eventually found out. \"Helen's situation looks completely modern and comprehensible, up to the moment when you realise her husband has the power to separate her utterly from her young children. Those kids will never see their mother again, and they've no say in the matter. When I'm writing historical fiction, I'm pulling the reader close, saying 'this girl is just like you, having a bad day just like you, she wants her gin like you want your coffee.' And then the next moment I shove you away, and say 'she's not you, she's an alien'.\"</p> <p>The historical fiction label doesn't faze her \u2013 nor does the lesbian fiction label, nor that of lesbian historical fiction. \"When Sarah Waters published <em>Tipping the Velvet</em> people said, lesbian historical fiction? That's a ghetto within a ghetto; a small cupboard in a ghetto. And look what she did with it! She's a perfect example of why you shouldn't limit yourself to what you think will succeed. But what she does, and what I've tried to do, is aim for a wide audience. I remember when I sent my agent <em>Stirfry</em>, she said 'You're assuming too much, you're limiting yourself. You could be read by a housewife in Texas, a lumberjack in Stockholm. Assume nothing.' Since then, I've written every book assuming just that. Having that broadly welcoming attitude is a good trick for anyone with a minority affiliation. It's not that I feel I need to water down my material, it's a case of broadening out. You cannot predict literary success; the only way you can possibly aim for it is to do your thing and do it well.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"<em>Malamikete de las nacjes, / Cad\u00f3, cad\u00f3, jam temp' est\u00e1, / La tot' homoze in familje / Konunigare so deb\u00e1.</em>\" (Enmity of the nations, / Fall, fall, it is already time, / All mankind in (one) family / Must unite itself.) The author of this late 19th-century hymn to internationalism, couched in a language so tantalisingly familiar and yet so frustratingly hard to pin down, was the Russian-Jewish linguist Ludwig Zamenhof, the begetter of Esperanto (meaning \"Hopeful\"). It was Zamenhof's hope that his universal language might open up an escape route from destructive nationalist conflicts, mapping instead a possible path to world peace. While the vision was utopian, the transformation it envisaged was necessarily incremental, and the project was solidly anchored in grammatical and lexical detail - perhaps too much detail. Enthusiasts for world harmony turned out to be no less fractious than the xenophobic nationalists they aspired to tame, and their own petty disputes over language \u2013 and in particular an enhanced form of Esperanto termed Ido (meaning \"offspring\" in the parent language) \u2013 soon led to an Ido-Esperanto schism.</p> <p>While it's easy to snigger at the grandiose delusions of Esperantists and other similarly dreamy minorities, such as advocates for a single world government, Earth doesn't seem entirely safe in the hands of the rest of us, with our passive but pragmatic acceptance of conventional politics-as-usual. At times I despair that the only order of things that might actually save the planet from environmental degradation is a global eco-dictatorship, in itself almost as worrying a prospect as the failure of the biosphere. How did we get to this depressing pass? Modern history in the industrial age appears to be the story of a fragmented humanity obsessed, alas, with its own parochial comforts and local interests, with little sense of the common needs of humanity as a whole. Except, as Mark Mazower shows in his brilliant recasting of the course of modern history since the Napoleonic wars, it's not as simple as that. While historians tend to tell stories about nations and their leaders, there is another way of relating the history of the last two centuries that brings into focus the role of global visionaries in reimagining a connected world community, and also the unsung efforts of practical secretariats of international organisations which \u2013 up to a point \u2013 succeeded in implementing a measure of global order.</p> <p>Europeans learnt various different lessons from the French revolution and Napoleonic wars. If the ancien r\u00e9gime, or at least a modified version of it, was to endure \u2013 reckoned nimble conservatives such as Metternich, Talleyrand and Castlereagh \u2013 then a broader international vision was required. Disturbances in one country could all too easily lead to universal conflagration, as Europe as a whole had learnt to its cost in the 20 years of warfare that had followed the French revolution. The \"Concert of Europe\" these men inaugurated was an informal scheme of cooperation among the great powers, which would aim at the maintenance of an overall balance of power and try to prevent crises, wherever they arose, from spiralling out of control.</p> <p>However, for other prophets of global order, Metternich and his friends were themselves the main threat to peace. Wars stemmed from the machinations of diplomats in elegant salons, and provided the sport of military aristocracies in every country. Peace was not to be obtained by careful adjustments to the balance of power, but by a major overhaul of the international system. Counterintuitively, as it might seem today, the radical Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini thought nationalism was the answer: once aggressive, top-down multi-ethnic empires were replaced by authentic national democracies, then a harmonious international society of states would be possible. The English Liberal Richard Cobden sought an alternative approach to peace in free trade. Cobden's pacific, anti-militarist vision of a reformed global economy of friendly, untrammelled exchange between commercial peoples (rather than their expiring feudal aristocracies) serves as a salutary reminder that while the cause of the (supposedly) free market has too often been affiliated in our own times with the military-industrial complex, the provenance of laissez-faire ideas was anti-elitist and far from conservative. Marxism too was a product of this milieu. Communist internationalism, Mazower argues, is best understood as yet another \"variant of the profusion of mid-19th-century visions of world order\".</p> <p>Well-intentioned woolliness of the sort that brings to mind Dickens's Mrs Jellyby was a striking characteristic of the era. Nevertheless, as Mazower shows, impractical high-mindedness was counterbalanced by effective international cooperation during the third quarter of the 19th century on a range of issues: humanitarian, juridical and scientific. The International Red Cross Committee, which had its beginnings in Switzerland in 1863, was the brainchild of Henri Dunant, a Swiss businessman, spurred to action by the suffering he had witnessed at the Battle of Solferino in 1859. However, in order to carry out its mission effectively, the new organisation required some kind of inter-governmental imprimatur, which it obtained from several small states, which met at the first Geneva Convention in 1864. As Mazower notes, this event marked a new departure in two directions. First, it involved small countries rather than the great powers of the Concert taking the lead. Furthermore, it marked a shift away from the pious hope that war might be stamped out entirely towards the more attainable goal that the practice of warfare be regulated&#xa0;and made, if only slightly, less horribly bestial.</p> <p>Along a parallel route the Belgian lawyer Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns established an Institute of International Law in Ghent in 1873. No longer would international relations be the exclusive monopoly of a traditional caste of diplomats who preferred discretionary powers and secret deal-making to rules and formal arbitration. The International Telegraphic Union was founded in 1865 to facilitate speedy cross-border communications, and the Universal Postal Union followed in 1874. In line of descent from these enduring late 19th-century developments was the League of Nations, whose energetic secretariat \u2013 including the founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet \u2013 and unsung practical activities in fields such as public health Mazower rehabilitates from post-1945 condescension.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mazower's history is not a straightforward celebration of virtuous internationalists and the \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 kinder, gentler world they have created: an achievement now recognised in the EU's Nobel peace prize. Mazower exposes the ways in which the great powers \u2013 not least the US, under cover of the United Nations \u2013 have exploited international organisations as a fig-leaf for the otherwise naked exercise of self-interest. Nor does he allow us to forget the international double standard: that darker-skinned peoples outside Europe were long deemed to lack the requisite manners and institutions that would entitle them to join the much-vaunted community of civilised nations. Among Mazower's many delicious and understated ironies is his discussion of King Leopold II's Belgium: notorious for Leopold's personal exploitation of the Congo, which provoked Conrad's nightmarish masterpiece <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, but also, it transpires, the centre of \"fin-de-si\u00e8cle internationalist life\".</p> <p>\u2022 Colin Kidd's <em>British Identities Before Nationalism</em> is published by CUP.</p>",

There\u2019s going to be a lot of people in hospital tonight in Lebanon.</p> <p>When the bomb exploded it shook the neighbourhood - I was about 800m to 1km away. But broken glass starts around four to five blocks from the epicentre.</p> <p>There are at least 12 cars that have been destroyed by fire or explosions, including what looked like the car which had the bomb planted in it - it had been flipped over and landed on the hood of an Audi. It had been completely destroyed. There was broken glass throughout all of it. Almost like fallen snow.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sassine is an upper middle class enclave of Christian Beirut that is known for its opposition to the Syrian government making it an unlikely target for the Syrian rebels, Prothero said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was nothing specific around it that would indicate a specific or financial target. A few prominent banks have offices in the area. About 150m away is an opposition political party known as March 14th. About 100m away also is a Christian headquarters known as Lebanese forces.</p> <p>From the location of the blast it is difficult to know who is being targeted. My best guess is that someone tried to blow up a car with someone in it. Either a vehicle passing by another vehicle or the bomb was in the vehicle itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>The damage to nearby buildings was substantial, but did not suggest the blast occurred inside one of them.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a very prominent Syrian bank that was located right next to [the scene]. Several banks have offices there so its a possibility that a bank official was targeted.</p> <p>I would think it was unlikely to be a political act of violence against the Syrians based on its location, because this is probably the most devoutly anti-Syrian neighbourhood in all of Lebanon. So for somebody to set a car bomb off in an attempt to kill a Syrian official [would have known] they were going to put the lives of many people at risk. That seems unlikely to me, but it is Lebanon so anything is possible.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1015330-journalist-witness-to-beirut-bomb-scene-says-death-toll-set-to-increase-and-anti-syria-attack-unlikely/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1015330-journalist-witness-to-beirut-bomb-scene-says-death-toll-set-to-increase-and-anti-syria-attack-unlikely&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Journalist witness to Beirut bomb scene says death toll set to increase and anti-Syria attack unlikely&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50816045c0e343ef1abc7cc3\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-19T14:14:29.432Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'A terrorist act', says information minister</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lebanese information minister has described the explosion in Beirut as \"a terrorist act\".</p> <p>Al-Jazeera reports that security forces are clearing people from the area to preserve the \"crime scene\" for investigators.

In fact, the killing by the regime has increased more since Brahimi started to talk about the truce.</p> <p>Come here to Maarat al-Numan and see.

Let him come here and have a look.</p> <p>Bashar [al-Assad] and his group are liars. They might say that they accept the truce but in reality they will never stop the killing and the shelling.

  "<p>David Moyes has said he owes a debt of gratitude to Wayne Rooney and believes the former Everton prodigy wishes to return to Goodison Park later in his career.</p> <p>It is 10 years since the Manchester United forward announced himself beyond Everton with that stunning winning goal against Arsenal, his first in the Premier League arriving before he turned 17 and could sign a professional contract. Moyes was the Everton manager who gave Rooney his debut \u2013 Walter Smith having previously been denied the opportunity because the teenager was still at school \u2013 and believes it had a profound effect on his own Goodison career.</p> <p>Moyes admitted: \"I always say Wayne Rooney helped me as a manager. He got my name out there. I was the manager who was playing Wayne Rooney and for that I'll always be grateful that Wayne was at Everton when I arrived. I was able to put him into the team and all the media and public saw one of England's finest, if not their finest player. It helped my profile and I think it helped Everton as well. It drew more attention to them. I have a lot to be thankful to Wayne Rooney for, for being on the doorstep when I walked in here.\"</p> <p>The Everton manager and the England striker resolved their dispute over an extract in Rooney's autobiography several years ago and, despite the player's admission that he has struggled to deliver on the international stage, Moyes believes the prodigious talent has been realised.</p> <p>He added: \"I think he has gone on to be the player we hoped he would be. He has been an exceptional player, at the very top, for 10 years. He has won a European Cup and titles and other cups. It's not his fault England aren't doing as well as people would like. Generally England haven't done that well for a long time.</p> <p>\"It has been interesting watching him develop. A lot of people said David Moyes couldn't control or handle Wayne and he'd be better going off to Sir Alex at Manchester United, but I think Sir Alex has had his problems with him as well at times.\"</p> <p>Rooney joined United for \u00a327m after two seasons with Everton and, despite the acrimony that surrounded his exit, Moyes envisages the Croxteth-born striker returning to his boyhood club in time. \"I would definitely welcome Wayne returning here. It's in his blood,\" said Moyes. \"But it's probably more likely to be later on in his career. I think it might be something that he'd even welcome.\"</p> <p>Everton, meanwhile, have signed the former Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger on a short-term contract until January, subject to international clearance. The 30-year-old was a free agent following his release by Wolfsburg.</p>",
  "<p>It is easy to wonder how English football might have taken a different course if the Premier League derby between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea at Loftus Road on the corresponding weekend of last season had not been disfigured by John Terry's racial abuse of Anton Ferdinand.</p> <p>Terry could have played alongside Ferdinand's brother, Rio, in Fabio Capello's England team at Euro 2012; both of the defenders might remain active internationals; Terry could still be the England captain and not quite Public Enemy No1; Ashley Cole might not be Public Enemy No2; Chelsea's reputation could have avoided such harm; the courts and the independent panels would not have been exerted.</p> <p>And Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas might be in charge of the European champions, instead of his former Stamford Bridge assistant, Roberto Di Matteo, preparing to send Chelsea out at White Hart Lane against Tottenham Hotspuron Saturday, rather than sat in the opposite dugout, attempting to derail them.</p> <p>The last part is Villas-Boas's theory or, at least, a thought that has crossed his mind. The Portuguese has been resolutely unsentimental in public ahead of a game that everyone imagines he circled in bright red ink when the fixture computer did its work. Villas-Boas felt badly let down by the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, who dismissed him in March, only eight months into his Chelsea project, something he alluded to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/11/andre-villas-boas-roman-abramovich-chelsea\" title=\"\"> when he was unveiled as the successor to Harry Redknapp</a> at Tottenham in the summer.</p> <p>Villas-Boas has sought to stress that Saturday's early kick-off is not about one man or the notion that he is after revenge and the chance to ram home a point or two to Chelsea regarding his worth. Nobody really believes him. But there was a pang when he brought up what he believed to be the turning point of his managerial tenure at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>His team had arrived at Loftus Road for the fateful game on 23 October with 19 points from an available 24, and they sat three behind the leaders, Manchester City. They had played some decent football, too, even in their one defeat at Manchester United. But the 1-0 loss to QPR was the prompt for an erratic spell that rather set the tone for the remainder of his time at the club.</p> <p>\"When I go back to this date last season, before we played the QPR game and then our position at the end of the league and the events that happened after \u2026\" Villas-Boas said, tailing off. \"You have to gain stability and continuity. After QPR, we had a consecutive run of bad results. Football results are about stability and jumping from adversity. In my time at Chelsea, we never got that stability. We were always up and down.</p> <p>\"We went to Everton [in the Carling Cup, after QPR] and won, which was a massive win but then we dropped points against Arsenal [in the 5-3 home defeat]. It was those two Premier League fixtures in a row that took the belief from us being champions.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas's demise at Chelsea, which came to resemble a long kiss goodbye, has been well documented and, whether he likes it or not (and he does not), it shapes the narrative for this game at White Hart Lane. He was interrogated about Abramovich and Di Matteo, Terry and Fernando Torres and his answers were largely defiant.</p> <p>He has not spoken to Abramovich, he said, since the sacking and he did not suggest that he would seek him out if the billionaire were to attend the match. \"It's highly unlikely that he will be allowed into the dressing room or the tunnel,\" Villas-Boas said. He stood by the staunch backing that he gave to Terry during the race storm while he insisted that he had been \"extremely fair\" to Torres, the striker who misfired under his charge and became disillusioned.</p> <p>\"He had more than enough opportunities,\" Villas-Boas said of the \u00a350m signing from Liverpool, who he selected 31 times, 21 as a starter. \"In the end, it was two different teams. The relationships of Fernando-Liverpool and Fernando-Rafa [Ben\u00edtez] took him to a different level. It's common in football. His connection to Liverpool is so strong.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas will shake Di Matteo by the hand, rather than the neck, as he would surely be entitled to do. Di Matteo had begun to hear Chelsea players question his value as the assistant manager but his promotion upon Villas-Boas's departure was the prompt for the scarcely believable turnaround, which culminated in FA Cup and Champions League glory.</p> <p>Villas-Boas spoke of how the players had \"transcended themselves\" after he left, which he feels is \"normal\" after any managerial change. \"You have to convince the leader in a different way so you motivate yourself in a different way, you behave in a different way,\" he said. \"It happened with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, [Avram] Grant and Robbie [Di Matteo].\"</p> <p>In managerial circles, it is known to be part of sod's law. For a character as passionate as Villas-Boas, he might have felt like screaming when Chelsea pipped Bayern Munich in the Champions League final which, in the process, demoted fourth-placed Tottenham to this season's Europa League and set in motion Redknapp's dismissal. Where would Villas-Boas be if Bayern had prevailed? \"I wouldn't be here,\" he said, with a smile.</p> <p>Villas-Boas was engaging when he considered how football in England was \"very specific towards power, emotion, reaction, explosiveness\". \"It is a game full of emotion, a game led by emotions from the stands and emotions from the players,\" he said. \"Certain tactics apply but it is far more led on emotion than management.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas admitted that the ingredients were in place for a \"spectacular\" derby; two in-form teams with ambition and creative talent, and enough personality driven plot-lines to fill a book. The challenge for him is not to be consumed by the biggest of them.</p>",
  "<p>It's a fairly well-established fact, in political psychology, that <a href=\"http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Napier%20&amp;%20Jost%20%282008%29%20Why%20are%20conservatives%20happier%20than%20libe.pdf\" title=\"\">leftwingers report lower levels of happiness than rightwingers</a>. (This fact, you may have noticed, is self-reinforcing: learning of it makes leftwingers even gloomier.) What's much less clear is why. Conservatives like to argue that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/opinion/sunday/conservatives-are-happier-and-extremists-are-happiest-of-all.html\" title=\"\">it's because the things they value</a> \u2013 traditional families, faith, free markets \u2013 make people happiest. Liberals prefer to think conservatives are blinkered, clinging to <a href=\"http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Napier%20&amp;%20Jost%20%282008%29%20Why%20are%20conservatives%20happier%20than%20libe.pdf\" title=\"\">an ideology that lets them avoid confronting life's grim truths</a>; it's even been proposed that conservatism might be a mental illness. And there's an added complication: the social psychologists who study such questions, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/science/08tier.html\" title=\"\">as the American academic Jonathan Haidt has complained</a>, tend to lean left. But does that mean they are biased \u2013 or that, when you closely study the real world, you usually end up liberal? (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa-4E8ZDj9s\" title=\"\">\"Reality has a well-known liberal bias\"</a> \u2013 Stephen Colbert.) It's all very murky \u2013 though if you're a liberal, like me, that's less of a problem, as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iISI7ifh-AjUE3ejyC1wQmwFrMFw?docId=CNG.61c886c438708471a9f4ea23070fa70c.3a1\" title=\"\">studies suggest we might have more capacity for tolerating uncertainty</a>. So there's that.</p> <p>Truly illuminating new research in this field, alas, is almost as rare as a&#xa0;watertight argument in a Richard Littlejohn column. But <a href=\"http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/WP201209_JZB-DS_SelfInterest.pdf\" title=\"\">a forthcoming paper from the University of Pennsylvania</a> may be an exception \u2013 even though its authors, Jonathan Berman and Deborah Small, weren't studying politics at all. Their subject was selfishness. In a fascinating set of experiments, they showed that when you give people a financial windfall, they're happier if you insist that they spend it on themselves. If you give them the option of donating it to charity instead, but they choose the selfish option, they're less happy \u2013 presumably because of the undertow of guilt. After all, as Berman and Small write, \"Every dollar spent on oneself could otherwise be donated to someone in need.\" They gave their subjects a small cash sum as payment for a gruelling hour of psychology tests. Some were given a choice between keeping it and giving it to Unicef; others were told to spend it on themselves. (A control group was given a choice of two selfish options, to make sure it wasn't the mere fact of choice that caused misery.) Those on whom self-interest was imposed were happiest: they were \"freed to enjoy self-interest without selfishness\".</p> <p>Might this explain what conservatives are smiling about? <a href=\"http://www.peerreviewedbymyneurons.com/2012/09/16/why-are-conservatives-happier-the-selflessness-of-their-selfishness/\" title=\"\">As Eric Horowitz points out on his excellent blog, Peer Reviewed By My Neurons</a>, where I first discovered the study, rightwing ideologies do arguably impose selfishness on their adherents. If you believe that society benefits most when everyone pursues their own interests, then good, caring people are obliged to act self-interestedly. Guilt doesn't come into it. Liberals, meanwhile, may be as selfish as anyone \u2013 but their selfishness feels more chosen.</p> <p>Sadly, it's not feasible just to switch your deepest beliefs to ones that make you more cheerful. But there are other, smaller, nonpolitical lessons here for us all. One obvious tactic is to pre\u2011commit to your self-interested activities, instead of undertaking them spontaneously. Make hard\u2011to\u2011break plans with friends; pay for holidays months in advance; buy cinema tickets for next weekend now. The less freedom you have to back out, the more fun you'll have when the time comes, because doing something more selfless instead won't feel like an option. This is one sense in which even liberals probably shouldn't be pro-choice.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Follow Oliver on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverburkeman\" title=\"\">Twitter</a></p>",

He told folks he was \"the ideal candidate\" for the Tea Party. Now suddenly he's saying, \"what, who, me?\" He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.</p> <p>I mean, he's changing up so much and backtracking and sidestepping, we've got to name this condition that he's going through. I think it's called <strong>Romnesia</strong>. That's what it's called. I think that's what he's going through.</p> <p>Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.</p> <p>If you say you're for equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work \u2013 you might have Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say women should have access to contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care \u2013 you might have a case of Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlawing that right to choose in all cases, man, you've definitely got Romnesia.</p> <p>Now, this extends to other issues. If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1% and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks \u2013 you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you, that's some Romnesia.</p> <p>So I think you're beginning to be able to identify these symptoms.</p> <p>And if you come down with a case of Romnesia, and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your website, or the promises you've made over the six years you've been running for president, here's the good news: Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions.

  "<p>Are you, a US citizen, calling cousin Ivor in Budapest, or reaching out to your old pen pal Yasmeen in Sydney? The National Security Agency (NSA) can listen in on your personal cellphone or read what you might be emailing him or her from your personal computer without telling you. </p> <p>In 2008, the US Senate <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/washington/10fisa.html?gwh=8978A891887ACD9466895831C4E77845\">voted</a> to let the NSA wiretap any US citizens' emails and phone calls internationally in the interest of national security so long as the government's purpose was to collect \"foreign intelligence information\". In 45 minutes, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ checkpoint-washington/post/court-allows-challenge-of-us-surveillance- law/2011/09/21/gIQA5Z5ZlK_blog.html\">constitutional challenge </a>to the Fisa Amendments Act. As the Director of the ACLU's Center for Democracy, Jameel Jaffer, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jameel-jaffer/a-brewing-battle-over-war_b_1279361.html\">pointed out</a>, the amendments: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"gave the NSA unprecedented power to monitor the international communications of people living in the United States \u2014 to listen to their phone calls, and to read their emails. 'We are targeting our own country', one NSA whistleblower observed.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Though some in Congress argued that citizens were safe from having their communications intercepted \"unless you have al-Qaida on speed-dial\", dragnet surveillance of people with nothing at all to do with terrorism began at once. As Marty Lederman, at that time a law professor, <a href=\"http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/07/al-qaeda-on-speed-dial.htmls\">noted</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The new statute permits the NSA to intercept phone calls and e-mails between the US and a foreign location, without making any showing to a court and without judicial oversight, whether or not the communication has anything to do with al-Qaida \u2013 indeed, even if there is no evidence that the communication has anything to do with terrorism, or any threat to national security.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Feds can listen in to you now, \"whenever government deems it necessary for foreign intelligence reasons\" Jaffer explained to me. The vagueness of a phrase such as \"material support\", and the chilling effect resulting from that vagueness, was at the heart of the successful National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) group challenge.</p> <p>These Fisa amendments lose their authority in December, and the reauthorization battle will unfold in the context of a new high profile lawsuit's activities. This lawsuit is taking shape much like the one aforementioned <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/5/17/journalist_plaintiff_chris_hedges_hails_monumental\">that was won last month</a> by a group of reporters and activists such as Noam Chomsky and Chris Hedges. The ACLU group's lawsuit <a href=\"http://www.antiwar.com/ips/fisher.php?articleid=13181\">includes</a> several journalists and organizations including Naomi Klein, Chris Hedges, Human Rights Watch, the Global Fund for Women, the Pen American Center and the Nation Magazine.</p> <p>These citizens argue that they have changed their approach to work out of fear of incarceration for \"material support\" for terrorism if the NDAA was used against them. The ACLU group argues fear of NSA surveillance is hampering the abilities of these people to report the news, gain testimony from witnesses and represent victims of human rights abuses.</p> <p>Is it \"necessary for foreign intelligence reasons\" for NSA agents to spy on a Human Rights Watch lawyer talking to a woman service member about having been abused by a US contractor? Is it reasonable under those terms to spy on <a href=\"http://www.ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/supreme-court-refuses-hear-wiretapping-case,-government-can-keep-secret-whet\">a lawyer for a Guantanamo detainee</a> seeking to have a confidential discussion to build his defense against a bogus US charge (a transcript that then gives the US lawyers at Gitmo yet another advantage unavailable to opposing counsel in real due process situations)? Can the US government agents record non-fiction writer Naomi Klein's phone calls to fellow activist journalists in the UK, or to UK government sources who would want to leak a potential story to her? Maybe one involving US wrongdoing? </p> <p>Under these terms \u2013 sure thing, not a problem. (I should note, as always, that when governments eavesdrop on reporters and activists for \"national security\" they also secure leverage for all kinds of other harassment \u2013 even blackmail or entrapment on other issues \u2013 <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120536943121332151.html\">Eliot Spitzer-style</a> \u2013 since private relationships and conversations are swept up as well.) These groups all depend on access to confidential communications with their clients, as well as with witnesses to human rights abuses and other sources.</p> <p>The ACLU says the FBI and NSA are currently abusing the warrantless dragnet surveillance. When the organization filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see how it was actually being used, the FBI sent them some heavily redacted pages and explained that they could not yield more information about the surveillance since the business of turning in information on citizens' communications risk economic harm if their snitching were common knowledge. The ACLU wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The government doesn't want you to know whether your internet or phone company is cooperating with its dragnet surveillance program because you might get upset and file lawsuits asserting your constitutional rights.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the government's response to the lawsuit, you see the incredibly Alice-in-Wonderland-like nature of logic on the far side of the slide to totalitarian institution-building in America. Just as the government classified the techniques its agents had used to torture Gitmo inmates \u2013 and then threatened lawyers for prisoners with prosecution if they <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/september-11-attacks/9610884/Guantanamo-judge-orders-Khalid-Sheikh-Mohammed-lawyers-not-to-discuss-torture.html\">brought up the torture</a> on the grounds they would be revealing classified information \u2013 so are Obama's lawyers asserting that the litigants have no status to be plaintiffs since they were monitored in secret \u2013 essentially, they can't prove that they were monitored!</p> <p>I am not making this up: the government's position is that the ACLU's clients lack standing <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/warrantless-wiretapping-supreme-court\">because</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>they can't prove that their communications were (or will be) monitored under it. </p> </blockquote> <p>Right, because there are no warrants presented to subjects, which the fourth amendment requires, to prove that wiretapping is taking place. Because it is secret. Which is what the lawsuit challenges. And so on. Jaffer rightly calls that a cynical argument.</p> <p>Indeed, if you follow this line of argument, any lawsuit from any citizen involving secrecy could be thrown out for lack of proof if the secrecy obscuring the harm done to that citizen is sufficiently intact. We may be seeing a trend, or some sunlight, in the judiciary. Just as Judge Katharine Forrest stayed the NDAA recently because the Chomsky group proved harm, so are the ACLU team getting some traction. Jaffer's team have won one point already; with the backing of a three-judge panel on the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the ACLU case <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/national-security/amnesty-et-al-v-clapper\">has been allowed</a> to go through in a blow to the Obama Administration's challenge. </p> <p>The Supreme Court is scheduled to <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/national-security/amnesty-et-al-v-clapper\">hear</a> arguments on 29 October. If the ACLU prevails, then the case will be heard by a federal district court. The ACLU is asking that the amendments be struck down as unconstitutional on first and fourth amendment grounds. \"We don't know how this authority has been used because the government does not say,\" Jaffer noted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem with overbroad surveillance authority is that it has a chilling effect \u2013 whether the government uses it or not.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 The standfirst of this article was amended on 20 October 2012 to clarify the situation.</p>",
  "<p>At the heart of the wood, where the broad rides crossed, was the hunter's chair. Like an umpire's perch or a lifeguard's tower, the plastic bucket seat was set on top of an aluminium frame. It sheltered under an ash that sent the occasional leaf spinning to earth, marking the fall of autumn. The chair had a grandstand view down three lines of the cross, a clear sight of the partings in the vegetation, the slip roads that brought an animal out of the trees and into the line of fire.</p> <p>Nobody would be shooting this morning. A plank had been padlocked over the ladder rungs preventing all access. Facing east, this was an insect's sun deck. Two common darter dragonflies, wings spread, sat like aircraft on the solar runway, fuelling up. I was able to lean disrespectfully close to the lower of the two, so close that I could see into the gauze of its compound eyes. The bulbous head on its pin-thin neck gave a yes-no-maybe shake. Nothing else moved, except for the tip of its drumstick abdomen, which beat a silent rhythm, dabbing, but never quite touching the wood. The legs straightened, the insect flew.</p> <p>Along the ride edges, spiders crouched in wait among the long grass, but could not hide their dew-drenched webs. One with a caraway seed for a body had strung its sagging silk over the candelabra flowerhead of a hogweed plant. Others low down worked on a more is better principle, having sprayed out dense white meshes with no recognisable structure. On the crossroads itself, droplets of water glistened like fairy lights on the silk threads of a garden spider's orb web. The owner held fast in the middle, a brown crusader with a white cross on her back. She sat immobile, head lowered out of sight under a giant body beaded with condensation. I stepped forward cautiously, but must have triggered a guy rope, for the web suddenly twanged and now I was pulling her strings. She scuttled, stopped and settled once more, to resume her long game of patience.</p>",

Gas is like oil: even though there may be enormous quantities left, as time goes by, companies need to resort to ever more environmentally damaging methods (fracking, tar-sands, Arctic drilling etc) to get to those resources.</p> <p>Every source of energy carries a cost. For gas, the cost is fracking \u2013 which involves pumping poisonous chemicals into the ground \u2013 and for many renewables such as wind-farms and tidal barrages, it is that they impinge on nature, and require great effort and resources to build and maintain. Why do we so rarely mention the most obvious path to energy sustainability, which would be to simply use drastically less energy? The problem seems to be that we love our gadgets, our cars, our cheap flights, our air-conditioned shopping experiences and our brightly lit cities so much that we can't bear to limit even a little of our out-of-control creature comforts.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br><em>Cologne, Germany</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins suggests we should draw inspiration from Dieter Helm's call for a dash for gas. Yet rises in the cost of gas have been responsible for more than 80% of the increase in consumer energy bills over the last five years. We have a fundamental choice about whether we want to build more energy or burn more energy. A recent study for E3G finds this relates not just to the volatile price of gas, but also to the risk of policy failure. Our analysis shows that if there is less energy efficiency, less CCS or less nuclear than the government is planning, then the cost of energy in a gas-heavy system could go up almost 100%. But if these policies fail under a renewables-heavy system, then the cost of energy to the consumer is likely to go up no more than 8%. The lesson is that gas is not a cheap option. A gas-based energy system carries a heavy risk of much higher costs for the consumer.<br><strong>Nick Mabey</strong><br><em>Chief executive, </em><a href=\"http://www.e3g.org/\" title=\"\"><em>E3G</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Why the excitement over rising energy prices? When most of our energy is derived from finite resources of gas, oil and coal, the cost is bound to increase as resources get stretched. The real scandal is that poor have to pay a higher price per unit than the rich. The utility companies usually start with a standing charge and then progressively reduce the cost per unit as consumption rises. What the government should do is ban standing charges \u2013 after all, we don't pay a standing charge to visit a petrol forecourt \u2013 and ideally insist that the cost goes up per unit as consumption increases. This would benefit the small careful user and would encourage the heavy user to be more prudent, making the raw materials last longer, while we build energy generators for the long-term.<br><strong>Chris Hooper</strong><br><em>Backwell, North Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Wouldn't we all get cheaper energy bills if, instead of competing commercial firms, we had a single nationalised energy supply system (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Just like The Thick of It \u2013 PM firms up energy tariff plans</a>, 19 October)? Then, on top of the actual supply and administration costs, we wouldn't have to pay for competitive advertising, many separate administrative systems, \"churning\" costs, profits, dividends, directors' bonuses etc. Wouldn't this cut the cost by at least 15%? Competition between energy supply firms is a myth, as they all change their prices in similar fashion and the only competition seems to be between them as to who can make the most profit, not who can provide the cheapest and most efficient service.<br><strong>Michael Miller</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 I wonder if <a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/press-releases/angela-knight-appointed-chief-executive-of-energy-uk.html\" title=\"\">Angela Knight</a> expected her new job, as chief apologist for the energy industry, to be a doddle compared to her last job, as chief apologist for the banking industry?<br><strong>Graham Jump</strong><br><em>Guildford, Surrey</em></p>",
  "<p>After years of spin, the expenses scandal and the Leveson inquiry, highlighting the cosy relationship between media owners and governments, who is&#xa0;to blame for the public's lack of confidence in politicians? The&#xa0;BBC's political editor Nick Robinson and Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, unpick the relationship between Westminster and the media. Emine Saner listens in.</p> <p><strong>Rachel Reeves:</strong> When I was growing up, we talked about politics. I remember the 1987 election, I was eight years old and girls at school were talking about who their parents were voting for. We did think it mattered. By 1997, the first time I could vote, people were more cynical. When I was campaigning in 2010, people would say \"politicians are all the same\".</p> <p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> The classic conversation I hear in the back of a cab is: \"They're all in it for themselves, they're out of touch.\"</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> I wanted to change things \u2013 break down elites, and for people from my background to have the chances that people from the \"best schools\" have. I've always thought politics is the best way to achieve those things, and yet the public thinks that if you go into politics, that's the very last thing you want to do.</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> Since I became a journalist 25 years ago, I've seen a crisis in trust, first in politics and then in the media. It's a vicious circle where everyone involved thinks if they do down the other they'll be better off. So the media have a go at politicians, politicians have a go at the media \u2013 just try to make the other person look more corrupt than you are. Press releases come into my inbox from all parties, but particularly the big two, leaping on any allegation. The view is, \"Let's just feed a quote to the press.\" There are so many press releases that say, \"They're hypocritical, they're foolish.\" Things that basically attack [the other side's] motives.</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> It's not that I think [the Conservatives] have the wrong motives, I think they're on the side of the wrong people. They're not on the side of the people I&#xa0;came into politics to serve.</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> Do you think the public gets that point from the news stories politicians take part in? Don't they actually just get, \"Labour says these Tories are on the take\", and the Tories say, \"No, it's Labour who are on the take.\" And the Liberal Democrats say: \"They're all corrupt.\" They're all putting out the press releases. Don't come knocking on the door of the media and say, \"What are you doing to our image?\" My charge would be, \"What&#xa0;are you doing to your image?\"</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> That's a fair challenge. But it's not just the media and politics. There is also the questioning of all other institutions \u2013 banking, the judiciary, police. In all walks of life there are bad apples. In some ways, that questioning is a healthy thing, but the problem often is people see us as all the same.</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> The way out of that is not just to say, \"If the public wants to think banks are all corrupt, let's tell them they're corrupt, because at least then we're in touch with the zeitgeist.\" Surely people are looking for some big ideas, and some candour?</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> Tomorrow I'll go back to Leeds West, my constituency. My biggest achievements as an MP are things I've done locally, and if you ask people in Leeds what they know about me, it's the local things. In London, we're obsessed with what happens in Westminster.</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> I know lots of MPs who work hard for their constituencies, but there's another thing I think politicians do, which is to think, \"We can't win the national debate about how we're seen, so at least let's be seen as decent and honest and hardworking locally.\"</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> I don't think that's true. I went into politics to make a difference to the lives of ordinary people. I can do things down here [in Westminster] \u2013 try and get the government to rethink the pace of the cuts, but also protect local institutions and get people decent housing.</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> We in Westminster have been obsessed with the three Ss: spin, sleaze and splits. We haven't looked enough at the substance. There is a lot of substance politicians talk about in private that we are never allowed to hear about. People like me, who know these arguments are going on, ask about them and they say, \"Why are you asking about that, rather than the stuff we want to talk about?\"</p> <p><strong>Emine Saner:</strong> Can stories like the one about Andrew Mitchell be a distraction from more serious issues?</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> The Andrew Mitchell thing wouldn't matter if it didn't speak to a wider concern people have about the government. It stayed on the agenda because it gets to the heart of people's criticism of the government \u2013 that they are out of touch.</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> I don't have a problem with these soap opera stories, but I do have a problem when it seems we just wait for one soap opera to end and a new one to begin. When I was writing my book, I couldn't remember why half of the politicians I was writing about had resigned. Did we not spend, on all sides, a lot of time and energy on that sort of story and not much on why the banking system was failing, for example? We have to find a way of doing the more substantive questions and making them engaging, but it will require politicians not to say, as they do to me every week, \"You're right, that is the big question but we can't talk about that in public, could you imagine what they would do?\" For example, the winter fuel allowance \u2013 I&#xa0;cannot find a politician in Britain who thinks it's a good idea to give money to wealthy pensioners, and yet you can't have a proper conversation about it because it boils down to, \"You want to take money away from grannies.\"</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> You make it sound like some obvious thing, that the fuel allowance should go.</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> I'm not saying it should go. But I know it was the first paper on the desk of the new prime minister. I know there were people in the last Labour cabinet who thought it was crazy to give money to wealthy pensioners, and so do most people around David Cameron. It's a real debate, but you try having it in public.</p> <p><strong>RR:</strong> It was written about at the Labour and Lib Dem conferences. It's not like that debate has been closed down.</p> <p><strong>NR: </strong>My challenge to politicians is to dare to have more debate in public, to think aloud a little bit, and allow the public in.</p> <p><strong>ES:</strong> What impact do you think the Leveson inquiry will have on the relationship between politicians and the media?</p> <p><strong>NR:</strong> The difficult thing for Leveson is, how does he \u2013 and the politicians who are going to decide what to do about it \u2013 protect people, but without barring awkward questions for people in power? If you took an opinion poll and asked, \"Do you think enough difficult questions have been asked of politicians, bankers, media owners?\", the answer would be \"no\". The people in authority have always used whatever they can \u2013 libel laws, regulations \u2013 to avoid difficult questions and limit scrutiny.</p> <p><em>Live from Downing Street: the inside story of power, politics and the media, by&#xa0;Nick Robinson is published by Bantam Press on 25 October.

With his clipped officer's accent and boyish looks, Mitchell would not look out of place next to Bertie Wooster in the Drones Club.</p> <p>Unlike PG Wodehouse's bumbling character, the Conservative chief whip is no lightweight, intellectually or politically. He amassed a fortune working as a director at the investment bank Lazard before the last election and played a central role in helping to detoxify the Tory brand in five years as shadow international development secretary.</p> <p>Mitchell, 56, does, however, have two character flaws. These explain why he ran into difficulty at the Downing Street security gates last Wednesday evening and why he is taking time to remove the cloud above him.</p> <p>While Mitchell can be immensely charming, he has a short temper, as the armed police officers found out when they declined to open the security gates to allow him to leave on his bike. He can also fix opponents with a withering look and has been known to make the odd caustic remark.</p> <p>Mitchell's qualities \u2013 charm, brains and a mischievous sense of humour \u2013 have served him well in his 20 years in parliament. But his flaws, including an ability to make enemies, mean there is no shortage of Tory MPs lapping up every moment of his battle with the police.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-19T18:06:25.350Z\">at 7.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50819487c0e343ef1abc7ce7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-19T17:57:27.742Z\">6.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mitchell's resignation letter to the PM</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's an excerpt from the letter and once again, Mitchell as per his previous comments denies the majority of his alleged comments made to the officer on that day.&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is with enormous regret \u2013 not least because of the tremendous support and loyalty you have shown me during recent weeks \u2013 that I am writing to resign as your Chief Whip.</p> <p>Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfill my duties as we would both wish,.</p> <p>Nor is it fair to continue to put my family and colleagues through this upsetting and damaging publicity.</p> <p><strong>I have made clear to you \u2013 and I give you my categorical assurance again \u2013 that I did not, never have and never would call a police officer a \u201cpleb\u201d or a \u201cmoron\u201d or used any of the other pejorative description attributed to me.</strong></p> <p>The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark \u201cI thought you guys were supposed to f***cking help us\u201d.

  "<p>The Obama campaign is running on women's issues for a third day in a row, but this has been its most successful day yet. Attempting to encapsulate what it claims to be Mitt Romney's shifting positions on a number of issues, the president's team has hit on a catchy phrase: \"Romnesia\".</p> <p>Obama unveiled the new noun during a speech to students at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, claiming that Romney had forgotten earlier positions in which he had opposed equal pay for women and easily-available contraception and had supported outlawing abortion.</p> <p>The potency of the phrase was evident in the response of the audience, which laughed and cheered on first hearing on it and as Obama riffed on it in the remainder of his speech.</p> <p>It quickly became clear \"Romnesia\" was not just a throwaway line, as the Obama campaign followed up within minutes.

That phrase made Romney sound out of touch with contemporary society and the changes that have been taking place in the workplace and in attitudes towards women's rights.</p> <p>In Virginia, Obama pressed home the message. Romney said he was for equal pay but refused to sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work. Romney had said he was in favour of access to contraception but supported legislation that would allow employers to deny it. Romney had said he would protect women's right to abortion but had said earlier this year he would sign a law outlawing the right to choose in all cases.</p> <p>Romney is paying the price for having to move to the right during the Republican primaries and caucuses earlier this year, in order to win over over conservatives for whom abortion remains a top issue. Up against opponents such as Rick Santorum, who has an unyielding position on abortion, Romney was in trouble, having adopted a liberal position on the issue while fighting to become governor of liberal-leaning Massachusetts. In the primaries and caucuses, Romney shifted to the right, saying in one debate that he would be delighted to support legislation outlawing all abortion.</p> <p>The Obama campaign is running hard on the issue because women could hold the key to the election. Democratic candidates normally hold a lead over their Republican rivals among women and Obama has long enjoyed a lead of eight to nine points over Romney among likely women voters, compensating for Romney's lead among white males. But some polls have shown that lead eroding and the Democrats need those wavering women voters back.</p>",

Obama had an <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/16/cnn-poll-gender-gap-and-likeability-keep-obama-over-romney/\">18% gender gap</a> in his favor with women in April \u2013 and has lost it all. Equal numbers of women and men are now saying they support Romney in the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158048/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">last</a> Gallup poll. This is a disaster because Democrats can only win with the traditional gender gap, which is usually in the double digits. </p> <p>The Romney team has managed rather brilliantly to obfuscate his position on every issue \u2013 very few women know that if you go to his website, you find out that he does not support a woman's right to abortion <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57501172/romney-my-views-on-abortion-rights-are-clear-/\">except</a> in cases of rape or incest. Ryan is even more drastic in his extremism: supporting ending Planned Parenthood, for instance \u2013 which provides health care to 3 million Americans \u2013 and in <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/14/1119867/-Rachel-Maddow-Welcome-Congressman-Ultrasound-Ryan-to-the-Republican-Ticket\">favor</a> of punitive transvaginal probes for women who dare to choose abortion. Women are not aware, I think, of how invasive the Republican agenda is for their most personal healthcare decisions. The paradox is that the Republican message of 'smaller government' (get the state out of schools, out of healthcare, out of welfare) is reversed in Romney's radical plan for the far right <em>vis a vis </em>women's most intimate reproductive rights decisions. (To see a satirical take on the GOP agenda, one can watch the hilarious yet also tragic <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/87be7156f5/republicans-get-in-my-vagina\">Funny or Die video</a>, \"Republicans, Get in my Vagina\".) </p> <p>As for Romney's first executive order, should he win the presidency, must be to close Guant\u00e1namo. His next policies should involve the repeal of the Patriot Act, the closing of the Department of Homeland Security and the demise of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act\">National Defense Authorization Act</a>.

So far, his understanding of women seems to center on his wife \u2013 instead of talking to us himself, he uses Ann as a sort of ambassador to a culture he clearly doesn't understand and doesn't particularly respect.</p> <p>He could speak to us directly about the economy and recognize that the recovery has disproportionately benefited men (even adjusting for the fact that job losses disproportionately impacted men). He could realize that we exist in our bodies, and the physical needs of 50% of the population aren't \"special\" or negligible. He could appreciate that we're a population as diverse as men, and that our interests extend beyond our roles as mothers and care-takers. And he could prove that he has, at any point, considered women to be equal players in society.</p> <p>Even his story (or \"<a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx#.UH6ge5hq8ng.facebook\">lie</a>\", as it's also known) at the last debate about soliciting \"binders full of women\" to fill cabinet positions is telling: A man who was a consultant and a businessman for decades didn't know <em>any</em> qualified women? That speaks volumes about his views on half the population, and those views are reflected in his strongly sexist policy positions.</p> <p>Other than the things he definitely <em>shouldn't</em> do that he's already pledged to do on his first day \u2013 overturning Obamacare and reinstituting the deadly <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/20/why_kenyan_women_fear_romney/\">Global Gag Rule</a> \u2013 I would love to see any president propose a Bill of Women's Rights, ensuring the basic things women require for equal participation in society: universal health care coverage (including contraception, abortion, pre-natal and well-baby care); equal pay; federally-mandated parental leave; subsidized high-quality childcare with well-paid workers and comprehensive assistance to low-income families. But that's about as likely as Romney legalizing the kind of drugs one would need to believe a \"pro-family, pro-life\" Republican president would support legislation that actually helps women, men, children and families live better lives. </p> <p><em>Jill Filipovic is a freelance writer and blogger at Feministe, and a practicing lawyer in New York City</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tamara-winfrey-harris\">Tamara Winfrey Harris</a>: 'Romney has learned little from leafing through binders of women'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169538\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/17/1326838687226/tamarawinfreyharris_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Tamara Winfrey Harris\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For female voters like me, a candidate's image comes as a result of actions. That is why there is very little Mitt Romney can do before election day to convince me that his presidency would be good for women. His actions tell me just the opposite. For instance, the candidate has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood; voiced support for the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/birth-control-exemption-bill-the-blunt-amendment-killed-in-senate/2012/03/01/gIQA4tXjkR_story.html\">Blunt Amendment</a>, a bill introduced to restrict access to birth control and said that he supports overturning Roe v Wade. For anyone concerned about reproductive healthcare, Romney's stance should chill the blood.</p> <p>But healthcare isn't the only area where Romney fails to demonstrate the love for the ladies his wife <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/29/ann_romney_love_mitt_please/\">crowed</a> about during the Republican National Convention. While advisers say that, as president, Romney would not repeal the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, he did <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/mitt-romney-lilly-ledbetter_n_1973446.html\">oppose</a> the measure when President Obama signed it in 2009, giving women better opportunity to sue over pay inequities. His running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan \u2013 the man Ledbetter herself says \"<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/16/lilly-ledbetter-paul-ryan-scares-me-to-death/\">scares me to death</a>\" \u2013 opposed the Act.</p> <p>If his positions on women's bodies and our ability to work for fair pay are any indication, Romney has learned little from leafing through \"binders of women\".</p> <p>But perhaps the candidate's rhetoric does not reveal his true intentions. Maybe he's simply rallying his conservative base and a real Romney presidency wouldn't be so radical. The first 100 days of a Romney administration could be very enlightening. A clue as to his authentic objectives may come from what a President Romney doesn't do in its early days. As a candidate, Romney has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act \"<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/11/23/375846/romney-pledges-to-repeal-obamacare-on-day-one/?mobile=nc\">on day one</a>\", cutting off millions of women and families from preventative care and ending no-cost birth control benefits. Ignoring the hyperbole in the pronouncement (rolling back the Act wouldn't be that easy), keeping the Affordable Care Act intact and not working toward its demise would be a first step in convincing me that Mitt gives a whit about women.</p> <p><em>Tamara Winfrey Harris is a blogger on What Tami Said, and editor of New Demographic's Anti-Racist Parent</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deedee-garc-a-blas\">DeeDee Garcia Blase</a>: '[Romney] will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169539\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2011/10/26/deedeegarciablase_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"DeeDee Garcia Blase\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It will be very hard for Mitt Romney to improve his image with women voters because he has reversed his stance on the pro-choice/pro-life issue too many times. His reversals make him appear like a populist politician driven by polls. Remember, Romney gave an oath to protect a woman's right to choose until he decided to run under the Republican presidential ticket. How can a pro-choice woman trust Romney after he went back on his word? On the other hand, how can a pro-life woman trust him when his campaign recently stated that abortion \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/mitt-romney-abortion-ad_n_1972251.html\">should be an option</a>\" in certain cases?<br> In order for Romney to garner the trust of women voters, he will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end, else mistrust will continue to pile up. Right now, women do not know what his real conviction on the issue, and we become much more considerate of politicians who stick to their convictions. As it stands, we still do not know where his heart is really at. A woman has never served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS); therefore, any president promoting women to the JCS within his first 100 days would give many of us a sigh of relief and encouragement. So many women in the US are related to sons, daughters or relatives currently serving our armed forces, and we are feeling apprehensive and pressure with regard to the multiple wars we have been engaged in. It would be helpful knowing that more women are part of the \"advisory committee\", which helps plan joint operations and resolutions of military problems because, as it stands, there appears to be too much testosterone fueling those key decisions. It would be helpful for us to see balance at a strategic leadership level.</p> <p><em>DeeDee Garcia Blase is founder of Somos Republicans, and the president of the National Tequila Party Movement, which promotes Hispanic Get Out the Vote initiatives</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heidi-moore\">Heidi Moore</a>: 'it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/5/18/1337374473765/heidimoore_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Heidi Moore\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the current polls are to be believed, Mitt Romney is in line to draw the votes of roughly half the country. The question is: which half? What does Mitt Romney's half look like, and how do they picture the economic future under a Romney presidency? </p> <p>Governor Romney was correct in his \"binders full of women\" speech that America will not be on the road to economic recovery until women are sharing space in hiring decisions alongside equally qualified men. Unfortunately, the conversation around women in the workplace still seems to center around the most pragmatic basics being treated as romantic political dreams. For instance, it's difficult to picture a woman who will rush to the polls, full of passionate vigor, in support of the idea that it' going to be possible for her to one day have a good day at work <em>and</em> get home in time to pitch in for dinner or tuck in her kids. So it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way: we know that corporations respond to tax breaks. Would they also respond to tax incentives for businesses that show they pay their women as equally as they do men? </p> <p>You have to start rebuilding the economy somewhere.

Romney has surged to an average 4-point lead in key swing states due in large part to women supporting him, thus sending the Obama campaign in hyperbole overdrive. The ensuing panic by the left has resulted in the ridiculous, patronizing \"War on Women\" meme, followed by the insulting, \"vote like your lady parts depend on it\" that served only to turn women off Obama and move towards Romney.</p> <p>So excuse me if I find the question posed as a bit biased since it is President Obama who needs to change his tune with women. Whatever Mitt Romney is doing to move women to his side, he should keep doing it! He is leading in the popular vote <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\">52% to 45%</a>, and for the first time in this campaign, now leads in the electoral college.</p> <p>While women in the Obama White House <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/17/fox-accuses-obama-of-pay-discrimination-to-defe/190722\">make less</a> than the men, as governor of Massachusetts, of Mitt Romney's 20 cabinet positions, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/17/women-including-ex-cabinet-members-rally-around-romney-binder-project/\">ten were held by women</a>. In fact, his record from the 1990's is better than the top current Democratic governors and the upper echelons of Massachusetts government, and more representative of the female population than any state in the natio, according to a 2004 <a href=\"http://www.albany.edu/womeningov/\">State University of New York, Albany study</a>. It is my prediction, too, that Obama letting two high-ranking women in his administration, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, take the fall for his incompetency regarding the Benghazi attack that led to the murders of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans \u2013 and his subsequent cover-up \u2013 will heat up as an issue for women in these weeks before election day.</p> <p>That Obama and his cheerleaders in the media are overplaying their hand on the awkward \"binders\" phrasing as if it is a gaffe, is telling: Romney is trending upwards, and the Obama campaign has even had to abandon large chunks of their firewall strategy as Mitt Romney pulls close, even or ahead in states they thought were reliably Obama's. Once women <em>and</em> men got to see Mitt Romney in the debates without the biased media filter, they saw a man quite different than the one Obama and the left described. And they like him. Binders and binders full of women like and trust him. Obama is finding out the hard way that women vote with their brain and their wallets, and that's very bad news for him.</p> <p>A President Romney should repeat his stellar record of hiring women from his time as governor. And unlike President Obama, he can pay women what he pays the men, leading by example, whereas Barack Obama talks the talk, but won't walk the walk. Romney is also onto something big by pointedly addressing the growing number of women in poverty under Obama. His personal history of helping people combined with his business success and saving the Olympics can be put to good use by tackling this problem, rather than just putting more women on welfare and food stamps as has been the case in the Obama presidency. A President Romney should take the problem seriously. He would be a hero.</p> <p><em>Cher Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p>",
  "<p>There's no sign on the door of the first Marie Stopes clinic in Northern Ireland; the only way you'd know it was in there is the presence of Peter, an intense anti-abortion campaigner on the doorstep, whom we'll meet again shortly. There are no clues in the lobby, though the porter will tell you which floor you need. Even once I got upstairs I'd come out of the fire escape and gone back in again before I found the buzzer (they will put a sign on the door, soon \u2013 hard to say from here whether this is a bit of last-minute snagging or a planned attempt to fox protesters).</p> <p>Inside it is neat and new, but the layout is unlike any building I've seen: walls look illogical, but are in fact ingenious, meant to prevent clients from seeing one another. Less ingenious low partitions give the waiting room the air of the first-class part of a plane, where privacy is a chimera in which everyone colludes; if we all carefully avert our eyes, we can make believe that we can't see one another.</p> <p>\"The building was chosen for as much anonymity as possible,\" Dawn Purvis, clinic director and a former Progressive Unionist member of the Northern Ireland assembly, explains. \"It's very full, it has lots of other businesses in it. There's a Bupa downstairs which has 40 or 50 people coming a day for screenings; there's a lot of footfall.\" Purvis has been pro-choice throughout her career. She has spoken to scores of women who have had to travel to England for abortions. \"They nearly come to you expecting to be judged. Very often they make that journey alone. I remember going with a woman on that journey, you feel like there's a sign on your head telling everyone where you're going.\"</p> <p>If this sense of being scrutinised sounds like a misapprehension, born of a taboo, it isn't. Sam, a guy in his 30s who is neither for nor against the clinic, said: \"Every female going into that building now, people are going to be wondering what she's going in for.\" I make a face, to indicate that I think this is nuts. \"No, I&#xa0;know people who work in there. I&#xa0;know how upset they are.\"</p> <p>Great Victoria Street in Belfast is famous for its Europa hotel \u2013 reputedly bombed 33 times \u2013 but otherwise could be any high street anywhere, a mix of the cheerful and the workaday, with that peculiar scent-mix of fags and chip fat that was almost devised to make a pregnant person throw up. You can't tell by looking at it that this has always been, and remains, a city where everybody knows everybody else's business. But on that everybody is&#xa0;agreed, and it seems to an outsider like the most monumental oppression, even before you consider the laws that mean that this groundbreaking clinic will perform almost no abortions.</p> <p>They won't be able to do surgical abortions anyway; patients will still have to travel to England for those. They will be able to do medical abortions, pre-nine weeks gestation, but only on the conditions laid out by the 1937 Bourne judgment, which is to say when a woman's life is in danger, or her health will be&#xa0;permanently and severely damaged by having a child. There is no provision for legal abortion in the case of foetal abnormality, nor in cases of rape or incest. The 1967 Abortion Act that covers the rest of the UK doesn't apply here. In 2008, Purvis wrote to every MP in parliament, to try and gather support in bringing Northern Ireland under the purview of the act; not all of them replied, by any means, but, she says ruefully, \"of those that did, 80% weren't even aware that UK law didn't cover us\". As a consequence, only 43 legal abortions were performed in Northern Ireland last year \u2013 more than 1,000 women went to England for operations and gave a Northern Irish address. Nobody knows how many went and gave false addresses. Nobody knows how many women had abortions and couldn't or didn't want to get any follow-up care. Purvis estimates that it could be six months before this Marie Stopes clinic performs any treatment at all.</p> <p>So what's the clinic there for? \"A clear pathway: we've had women go to the GP and been seen by a consultant who has not offered a termination even where there's a threat to life. We've had women thrown out of their GP's office for even asking. Often a GP is a family GP that you've been with for many, many years. They'll be your parents' GP, your whole family's GP. Just knowing that there's somewhere here, at home, where they can have a conversation \u2026\"</p> <p>She says they have had thousands of messages of support, and it's observable that the office is full of cards and chocolates and gift bags. The service costs money: it's \u00a380 for a&#xa0;consultation, which just grinds it home how hard it still is for women without money. Purvis tells me something that astounds me, even though it should be perfectly obvious: \"The backstreet today is abortion pills off the internet. They don't even know what they're getting; they could be taking rat poison. The Family Planning Association have taken calls from women who've taken one set of pills and then don't know what to do, they've panicked.\"</p> <p>Outside, Peter is alone: there were 300 on Thursday, but they have quite a lot of ground to cover, given their semi-permanent protests outside other organisations that offer family planning advice and STI testing. \"No disrespect to women,\" he says, \"but if she goes out and has a one-night stand, then has an unwanted pregnancy, then goes to the doctor, says, 'I'm depressed, I'm going to commit suicide' \u2013 this is very easily done \u2013 has an abortion, where's his say?\" I've already forgotten who the 'he'&#xa0;is \u2013 the doctor? The baby? \"The guy she had the one-night stand with!\" he says. \"What, you think he wants to have a&#xa0;baby?\" \"I'm not saying he does! I'm just saying, where's his say?\"</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street has insisted it will press ahead with controversial legislation to require electricity companies to put some customers on cheaper tariffs, saying plans from the gas regulator, Ofgem, outlined on Friday did not go far enough.</p> <p>No 10 said that while it had been aware Ofgem was going to set out proposals this week, this had not prompted David Cameron's initiative on Wednesday, when he appeared to commit the government to forcing energy companies to put all customers on the lowest rate. It added that it had not been briefed on the detail of the Ofgem plans when Cameron made his remarks and said that while Ofgem's commitment to greater transparency and its plans to require companies to inform customers of cheaper deals were welcome, they were not sufficient.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the prime minister claimed Ofgem's plans, which would simplify bills and prevent suppliers offering more than four primary tariffs for each fuel type, would sit alongside Cameron's stated plans for legislation that could force suppliers to give customers the cheapest deals.</p> <p>On Wednesday the prime minister said he would oblige energy companies to provide customers with the lowest tariff. The next day, he was forced to admit he had only raised an option for inclusion in the energy bill. He said he was considering requiring energy companies to put some direct debit customers on low tariffs with a customer's right to opt out.</p> <p>His announcement was criticised by consumer groups and Labour as unworkable.</p> <p>Downing Street said the legislation would complement Ofgem's changes. \"It is really the same agenda. We have been working with them for some time on this and will continue to work with them. As the prime minister said, we will use forthcoming legislation to ensure that people get the lowest tariffs.\"</p> <p>Asked whether the legislation would override Ofgem's proposals, she replied that they would be \"taken into account\".</p> <p>The Ofgem plans to force suppliers to inform householders about their cheapest deals and greatly simplify the number of pricing plans are part of what it is calling the biggest shakeup of the market for domestic energy for more than a decade.</p> <p>Ofgem's proposals will, according to its chief executive, Alistair Buchanan, bring a \"simpler, clearer, fairer and more competitive energy market for all consumers\".</p> <p>Companies would be forced to put consumers on the lowest tariffs only in very special circumstances.</p> <p>Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: \"This is a positive package of measures which should help to make the energy market clearer and simpler. Particularly welcome are proposals which could cut the number of available tariffs by half. Ofgem needed to act to make the energy maze less impenetrable and these are important and overdue measures.</p> <p>\"Events of recent days have created more heat than light. Government and regulators need to plot a clear and consistent path on energy market reforms which puts the interests of consumers at the heart of the process. Regulation, legislation and effective competition all play a role in delivering an energy market that works for, not against consumers.\"</p> <p>The chairman of the energy select committee, Tim Yeo, wrote to the energy secretary on Friday night expressing his surprise at Cameron's proposals. He warned: \"The later the bill reaches the statute book, the later investment in urgently needed new electricity-generating capacity, and in particular low-carbon generation, will come forward.\"</p> <h2><strong>Knight's moves</strong></h2> <p>Angela Knight must relish a challenge. The woman who defended the industry during one of the worst periods in its history now takes the flak for energy suppliers. As chief executive of trade association Energy UK, she has to stand up for firms pilloried for driving up prices and trumpeting record profits. Knight became chairman of the British Bankers' Association on April 1, 2007 just months before the queues formed outside branches of Northern Rock in the first run on a British bank since the 19th century.

There is really no excuse for the fact that they have not been able to deal with it.\"</p> <p>The warning comes as seven foreigners working for French oil transport company Bourbon were kidnapped while boarding a vessel belonging to the company on Nigeria's Pennington river earlier this week.</p> <p>A statement on the company's website <a href=\"http://www.bourbon-online.com/en/news/2012/10/situation-in-nigeria-10-17-2012\" title=\"\">said that six Russians and one Estonian employed as crew members by the company were being held captive</a>, and that efforts were underway to obtain their release.</p> <p>\"The emergency unit set up immediately by Bourbon has been set up to aim at their rapid liberation under the safest security conditions,\" the statement said. \"Bourbon is in contact with the crew members' families, supporting them, and keeping them regularly informed.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Nigeria's Joint Military Task Force told the Guardian that joint military-naval operations were underway to catch the attackers, and confirmed that incidents of kidnapping and piracy were on the increase.</p> <p>\"The Bourbon vessel that was conveying the expatriates during the incidents has been recovered. We have forward operational bases in the Niger Delta and our maritime friends are at the moment conducting a search to track down the kidnappers. We are conducting a lot of intelligence gathering\" said Lt Col Oyeama Nwachukwu.</p> <p>Although the legal definition of piracy encompasses acts of violence on the high seas, rather than in territorial waters, the incident is one of a growing number linking thieves in Nigeria's Niger Delta, where hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil are stolen from pipelines each day, to increasingly bold attacks on ships.</p> <p>There are concerns that piracy in and around Nigeria could engulf the entire west African coastal region \u2013 known as the Gulf of Guinea \u2013 an increasingly busy maritime region and a major thoroughfare for valuable commodities such as oil, gold, bauxite and iron ore, and agricultural products.</p> <p>Although Nigeria's navy is regarded as relatively successful at tackling piracy off its own shores, experts say the problem has been pushed outwards to neighbouring countries who have little capacity for maritime law enforcement.</p> <p>Benin and Cameroon have both reported rises in piracy attacks, which experts attribute to Nigerian pirates.</p> <p>Benin \u2013 which depends on its port for around 40% of income \u2013 has asked the UN to send an international force to help police the coast in the region. Since being labelled a high-risk country by London-based marine insurers' group the Joint War Committee, the country has suffered a 70% fall in shipping resulting in an estimated \u00a350m ($81m) loss in customs revenue, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=un%20secretary%20general%20assessment%20mission%20piracy&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.securitycouncilreport.org%2Fatf%2Fcf%2F%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D%2FGuinea%20S%202012%2045.pdf&amp;ei=c41AUOTNBtDNswbZuIC4CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa059ayt0PaHfRcbSElZOk2I3otw&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">according to a recent UN report</a>.</p> <p>The problem has led to calls for a regional taskforce and outside intervention to rival the Nato and EU-led efforts off the coast of Somalia.</p> <p>The US military said it was stepping up attempts to create a regional taskforce to deal with the problem of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.</p> <p>\"In the past, most of our efforts have been bilateral,\" US Africa Command head of air and maritime programmes told Reuters. \"Now we are focusing on a regional basis because the solution in regional. Events are picking up in Benin and Togo because Nigeria is stepping up its enforcement efforts.\"</p> <p>France has also bolstered surveillance in the region, with reports that the French military will conduct anti-piracy training in Benin and Togo later this year.</p> <p>\"This is a crime which easily spills over across borders, therefore there is a great need for co-operation and information sharing between the countries, but so far in west Africa that cooperation appears to be patchy\" said Mukundan.</p>",
  "<p>The Kremlin launched a charm offensive aimed at persuading investors that BP's Russian interests would be safe with its national oil champion, Rosneft.</p> <p>Igor Shuvalov, deputy prime minister, said on Friday the government would consider further privatising the largely state-owned oil group next year, while Rosneft itself boasted of having \"dynamic\" potential.</p> <p>The moves came as the BP board met in London to consider a recommendation from the chief executive, Bob Dudley, that it agree a $26bn (\u00a316bn) cash and shares offer from Rosneft for its 50% stake in the Russian oil producer TNK-BP. Under the deal BP is expected take a stake of more than 15% in Rosneft plus more than $15bn in cash, part of which may be distributed as a special dividend.</p> <p>BP said it would make no statement until all the details had been clarified and signed off. There is an expectation that a formal agreement will come early next week.</p> <p>The company will still have to obtain various governmental approvals in Russia and may have to put the asset sale and share swap formally to investors in an extraordinary general meeting. That depends on a ruling from the UK listing authority but BP will be anxious to ensure that there is general support for the move anyway.</p> <p>\"For the TNK-BP sale we will of course discuss with the listing authority and comply with the relevant regulatory requirements at the right time to ensure we have the correct approvals, including shareholder approvals if necessary,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>Investors have been frustrated by the company's inability to raise its share price, which stubbornly remains 30% below its level before the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010. Some analysts have called for the company to be broken up to extract more stock market value from the business.</p> <p>The Russians are aware that BP investors \u2013 many of whom are based in the US \u2013 are sceptical about the operational performance of Rosneft and the political influence on it from Vladimir Putin's government.</p> <p>The Kremlin owns about three-quarters of Rosneft and has constantly talked about lowering its stake to 50% plus one share. The state was originally supposed to shed 15% this year but the plans were scrapped.</p> <p>Shuvalov told Russian news agencies that the government would consider selling a stake in 2013 and 2014, depending on market conditions. Rosneft managers and officials agree on the need to pick \"the best time\" to sell and find a \"quality investor\", he said.</p> <p>Shuvalov declined to comment directly on the Rosneft offer to buy BP's half of TNK-BP and the other 50% owned by Russian oligarchs, who make up the Alfa Access Renova consortium.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rosneft representatives in London were busy sending briefing notes describing its structure (of part state energy company and part global corporation) as \"unique\", with production levels higher than Norway.</p> <p>It claimed that state involvement reduced investment risks associated with long-term projects and enabled \"responsible access\" to the Russian Arctic and other offshore opportunities.</p> <p>\"As a public corporation, Rosneft's main strategy is to create value for shareholders making management very commercially focused,\" it said, while claiming that it had increased production more than tenfold in a decade.</p> <p>But while Rosneft and the Kremlin were playing up the opportunities for BP, in Russia there was some criticism that a full takeover of TNK would strip the country's strategic oil sector of competition and efficiency.</p> <p>Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister and now an opposition leader, said: \"This is the restart of a process of renationalisation of the oil industry, which was suspended several years ago.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, in an apparently unrelated incident, a manager at TNK-BP has been arrested on suspicion of fraud. The interior ministry said in a statement that the suspect, who had previously worked in the Irkutsk regional government, had in September offered jobs in the Kremlin to two businessmen in return for payments of $3m apiece.</p> <p>Executives at TNK-BP have in the past had run-ins with Russian law enforcement at times of shareholder friction, with two managers arrested in 2008 amid a dispute over strategy that forced Dudley, then chief executive of TNK-BP, to flee Russia.</p>",

  "<p>'Ten years and seven months.\" Janis Sharp leans in over a small, round table piled with newspapers. The table, on which there is also a bouquet of flowers, is set next to a picture window that looks out on to a generous garden, where a cat prowls and a fish pond bubbles, and the late afternoon sun streams through the trees. The scene is so bucolic that it takes a little while to notice the old laptop that hums, slowly overheating, in front of the sofa on the other side of the room. This is the laptop in front of which she has spent most of those 10 years and seven months, writing letters, petitions, learning the law on extradition, searching for persuasive parallel cases to that of her son, Gary McKinnon, the computer hacker wanted for extradition to the US; it's also how she taught herself about Asperger's, the condition she only&#xa0;discovered he had when he appeared on TV in 2008 and scores of people wrote in, diagnosing him. Looking over at that side of the room, one can almost feel the accretion of hours spent tapping away, the winter dawns when she rose in terror in the dark, and started writing letters, \"and at&#xa0;two in the morning I'd still be there writing to people, but it helped\".</p> <p>It certainly did. On Tuesday home secretary Theresa May stood at the dispatch box and announced that after&#xa0;reviewing the evidence she had&#xa0;concluded \"that Mr McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr McKinnon's human rights\". She further announced that she&#xa0;would be introducing a \"forum bar\": \"where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so\". It is now up&#xa0;to the CPS to decide whether and how McKinnon will be tried here.</p> <p>Janis Sharp has never claimed her son&#xa0;is innocent. She does dispute, however, that his actions \u2013 &#xa0;described as a fishing expedition for \"little green men\" \u2013 constitute, in the words of a US prosecutor, \"the biggest military hack of all time\". She does a&#xa0;lot&#xa0;of disputing, for someone who says&#xa0;she is essentially shy. Fact after fact, delivered at speed, in her clear Glaswegian accent, case after case \u2013 extraditions stayed, or not stayed, and&#xa0;if&#xa0;they were stayed, whether there were friends in high places; hackers who have Asperger's, famous people who have children who have Asperger's, and have given her advice, explaining her own son to her. \"When I'm in a corner, I&#xa0;fight, and that's basically it.\"</p> <p>Fighting because you're cornered is one thing, but fighting such outsize opponents \u2013 the British establishment, the US government? \"I'm not scared of them. I don't really believe in hierarchy. I mean, I'd argue with the QC, I would argue if I thought someone was wrong. I&#xa0;respect people for what kind of person they are, how good they are \u2013 not what position they happen to be in. Respect is&#xa0;earned,\" she says, laughing. \"[I&#xa0;believe in] a spiritual hierarchy, rather than the other one.\"</p> <p>Sharp grew up in Glasgow. Her mother was a buyer for a department store, and her father, a telecommunications engineer, came from Stornoway, where his family spoke only Gaelic, and worked on the land. \"They were brought up raising and killing animals, so I say, 'Oh, where did I come from?'\" \u2013 she and her second husband, Wilson Sharp, are strict vegetarians. She left school at 15, was married four days after her 16th birthday and gave birth to Gary when she was 17. He spoke at 10 months, and was discussing the stars and planets by the time he was two years old. Generally placid, he screamed inconsolably whenever he was on a bus. \"It's an Asperger's thing \u2013 a terror of travel is what it is, but I didn't know that then.\"</p> <p>When Gary was six, she and her new&#xa0;husband moved to Crouch End in&#xa0;north London, and spent the next few&#xa0;decades gigging all over the city, calling themselves Axess, and then Who's George?, under which name they recorded a couple of singles at Abbey Road; they bought a recording studio, and made a living recording other bands. They used to buy and sell antiques, too, and write and illustrate children's books, but they haven't done&#xa0;any of this for the last seven years; they simply haven't had time. As for Gary, who used to sing and&#xa0;write his own music, \"Gary hasn't touched an instrument for years. He&#xa0;said he couldn't, because of the feelings it would bring up \u2013 he couldn't cope with it. He's so raw, and he shut himself down so completely that it would open everything up \u2013 and how can you&#xa0;deal with that?\"</p> <p>He was an unusual child, but then, they were an unusual family. \"He's among very eccentric people who are musicians and artists; we have friends who talk about their past lives as though they happened last week, so Gary was just more eccentric. Same reason we have animals that are considered difficult, or if we foster children that are considered difficult.\" She and Wilson have often fostered, on an emergency basis, older children or sibling groups; Janis \u2013 no surprise here \u2013 would often argue fiercely with their social workers over their rights. \"I don't find them difficult. I&#xa0;just loved Gary, but he was very different, and there were lots of things that were difficult for him.\"</p> <p>When he was nine, he went out and&#xa0;bought a book on body language. \"And we thought, 'What on earth are you doing? Body language?' We didn't realise he didn't recognise facial expressions.\" She and Wilson have spent a lifetime trying to protect him, and others, from the consequences of&#xa0;this, and of his impulse to tell the truth, regardless of the fallout. \"If someone says to Gary, 'Do I look fat?' he'd say, 'Yes.' I'd actually say to him, 'You can't say that,' and he'd&#xa0;say, 'Why?'&#xa0;I said, 'Because you're offending them,' and he said, \"but I'd rather know&#xa0;if I asked; they're asking because they want to know.' I said, 'No,&#xa0;they don't really want to know. They want&#xa0;reassurance.'\"</p> <p>She laughs, but she obviously carries a good deal of sadness about what she could not see about her son, because she did not know to look. For instance, she did not find out, until the Cambridge psychopathologist Simon Baron-Cohen started working with Gary, that he had been severely bullied at a school. \"Part of it was my fault, because I would see a jumper and say, 'Oh, I'll get that jumper \u2013 that would look nice on Gary,' and somebody at school would say, 'That comes from a women's shop.' It was fine, but kids are cruel.\"</p> <p>He was expelled from junior school. He would be disciplined for being \"dreamy and coming late and not come in [at all] some days\". At 16 he had what&#xa0;she describes as a \"meltdown\" so serious \u2013 he stopped being able to speak, to function at all, and collapsed twice on&#xa0;tube platforms \u2013 that they thought he had a brain tumour, and took him to a neurologist, who discovered nothing.</p> <p>\"I've found out what it is since then,\" she says \u2013 it was that same terror of travel, compounded by the fact that \"he&#xa0;was going into town in London to work as a trainee hairdresser and it was&#xa0;the first time he'd actually left everything he knew, and people with Asperger's can't do that; they never live on their own, that's how they are\".</p> <p>When, one morning in 2002, he called&#xa0;her and said that he had just had a&#xa0;four-hour interview at the police station about hacking US government computers, she was both furious, and immediately, totally scared. Furious because, \"I said, 'Why the heck didn't you ring me? I've told you your entire life, if you ever get in trouble, you ring me and I get a lawyer.' But he didn't, because they were a hi-tech crime unit, 'Computer people, just like me.'\" And&#xa0;scared, of course, because it was America, and not long after 9/11.</p> <p>There followed a period of almost phoney war when nothing much happened. \"I didn't realise they were waiting for this treaty to come in where you didn't need any evidence.\" Then on 7 October 2004, the US government filed a request for Gary's extradition, and on 7&#xa0;June 2005 he was arrested.</p> <p>Their lives changed completely. She and Wilson, who were living in Enfield, sold their home in order to access the equity. Gary stayed in north London where he lived with his girlfriend. (Wilson notes, quietly, that May's decision came in the nick of time: despite help from people such as David&#xa0;Gilmour, who paid, among other things, McKinnon's psychiatry bills, they are running out of money).</p> <p>And they fought and fought. How did she keep going? Did she ever feel like giving up? \"I always believed it'd work; I&#xa0;knew Gary wasn't going. I just knew he couldn't go, that it couldn't happen. But yeah, you have very upset times and every night you go to bed you're in terror. And every morning you wake up&#xa0;with that feeling in the pit of your stomach all the time. I'm the most optimistic person you could come across normally, but all the time I&#xa0;had&#xa0;this fear, and it's awfully hard to&#xa0;always have that.\"</p> <p>Did she ever go to professionals for&#xa0;help for herself? \"No, no, no; I&#xa0;don't&#xa0;go to the doctors and I don't take&#xa0;medication.\" \"She says it hasn't affected her health, but she does get stressed,\" says Wilson, later. \"Nothing you could put a frame around and hang&#xa0;on the wall, but \u2013 she's still my&#xa0;lovely Janis.\" A pause, thinking. \"She drinks more tea.\"</p> <p>She says she had to keep strong for everyone else: Gary's father was so upset that his sons by his second marriage were terrified he might die. \"Wilson was always feeling stressed \u2013 I&#xa0;was really worried, I thought, 'God, am I going, at the end of this, to lose Wilson to a heart attack or stroke?'\" She looks at him, fondly. Their relationship seems tender, obviously caring. Wilson kept her going. \"He&#xa0;feeds me \u2013 he cooks amazing food. He gives me tea, he looks after me.\"</p> <p>And strong for Gary himself, of course, who, whenever they lost an appeal, shut down completely, sitting for hours in the dark with his cats. At these times, the fear of extradition was&#xa0;combined, for her, with a total and well-founded fear that he would kill himself, which was, for him, an entirely logical response to the problem. He told Baron-Cohen that once, after he had been drinking \u2013 he had never drunk before he was charged \u2013 he woke to find&#xa0;himself in a bath with a knife next&#xa0;to him. Another time, Janis found chemicals often used in suicides in his&#xa0;house. From then on, he was in effect on suicide watch. Janis organised it so that someone \u2013 herself, another relative, or his girlfriend, Lucy&#xa0;(a charity worker who began as his&#xa0;carer; nearly 40, she would love to have children) \u2013 was there with him, every hour of the day or night.</p> <p>Janis would sit and talk to her son about his cats, which he loves, about music, about anything but the case or the fact that he'd been unable to work for a decade. Then when she got up to leave, she would \"see the tears in his eyes and I would start making excuses to stay longer, but it was getting worse and worse and worse and worse. You're so scared that you would lose him when you feel that you've still got it in your grasp to stop it.\"</p> <p>And now, against all the immense odds, she has succeeded. She has stopped it. One suspects it will require an entirely different kind of strength to&#xa0;pick up the pieces \u2013 her son was so overwhelmed by Tuesday's news he literally could not speak \u2013 but in the meantime Janis glows with nothing but&#xa0;relief.</p>",

But that's a shame because we've just witnessed one of the UK's parties of government pass through a rite of passage. As they become mainstream, protest parties inevitably shed some of their idealism and, although the SNP has been in government since 2007, this afternoon it has just became a little bit more grown up, electable - and conservative. The vote showed that the party is essentially split, and some colleagues believe that, by focusing attention on the practicalities of independence, it won't actually help the SNP's cause. For example, quite when and how a Scotland committed to Nato evicts Trident submarines from the Clyde remains a mystery.

The SNP wishes Scotland to fulfil its responsibilities to neighbours and allies. On independence Scotland will inherit its treaty obligations with NATO. An SNP Government will maintain NATO membership subject to an agreement that Scotland will not host nuclear weapons and NATO continues to respect the right of members to only take part in UN sanctioned operations. In the absence of such an agreement, Scotland will work with NATO as a member of the Partnership for Peace programme like Sweden, Finland, Austria and Ireland. Scotland will be a full member of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the European Union and the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE).</p> </blockquote> <p>There are two amendments to the motion relevant to Nato membership.</p> <p>One says that Scotland should only remain in Nato provided Nato \u201ctakes all possible steps to bring about nuclear disarmament\u201d.</p> <p>And the other says that the SNP should continue to oppose Nato membership.

That the leadership probably will carry the day but that it will be close. And this morning, I\u2019ve been gathering views to show the range of opinion on the matter. Never mind me, here\u2019s what the delegates think:</p> <p>Cllr Mhairi Hunter has been mandated by her Glasgow branch to vote for amendments a) and c) in the debate ie vote against the resolution. Why? <em>\u201cMembers of our branch feel strongly that NATO has shifted in recent years from being a defensive to an offensive alliance. They do not see it as in Scotland\u2019s interests to be in that alliance.\u201d</em></p> <p>She\u2019s not the only delegate mandated to vote. I spoke to four stalwarts from Alyth and District branch \u2013 including one delegate who began supporting the SNP in 1946 \u2013 who are all mandated to vote for the resolution. The rationale? <em>\u201cIt\u2019s better to be in than out \u2013 which doesn\u2019t mean to say we have to use it, but we need a defence mechanism. We need the umbrella support of other countries. We need to forge relationships with other countries</em>.\u201d They were keen to affirm their non-nuclear stance and also pointed out that if the referendum is won, it won\u2019t necessarily be the SNP forming the government post-independence. The point being that they were quite relaxed about the policy shift.</p> <p>Not everyone is mandated, though. Richard Bell, a delegate from one of the Glasgow constituencies, is one such and he\u2019ll be voting to maintain current party policy. \u201c<em>I don\u2019t believe in NATO and I don\u2019t believe the party or indeed, Scotland would be able to be in NATO and maintain our non-nuclear status</em>.\u201d Which sums up the view of many voting against, or rather for amendments a) and c).</p> <p>Diane Alexander, a delegate from Bonnyrigg, is another voting against. \u201c<em>I believe we\u2019ve used nuclear weapons as a veil for peace but if you look around the world, there are wars everywhere and little sign of peace. Nuclear weapons are not doing what they claim. We need new solutions and the only those solutions can work is through a commitment to peace, by resolving our issues with other countries through the Partnership for Peace</em>.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://whitehall1212.blogspot.com/2012/10/snp-prepares-to-cross-nuclear-line-in.html\">\u2022 Torcuil Crichton on his blog says the SNP is using bogus figures about Scotland's economic position.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The one stat that's been&#xa0;trundled out by speaker after speaker in the last two days is that Scotland contributes 9.6 per cent of UK taxes&#xa0;but receives only 9.3 per cent in return. John Swinney did it again this morning and he should&#xa0;know better.</p> <p>It's not really an&#xa0;apples and apples comparison. In&#xa0;numerical terms that's \u00a353.1bn in to the Treasury pot and \u00a363.8bn back out, as spending is higher than the tax take, thanks to borrowing.</p> <p>Similary the \"Independence Dividend\" of \u00a3500 for every man, woman and child that Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond trumpeted yesterday is based on one year, 2010-11, when Scotland's levels of indebtedness was lower than the rest of the UK.</p> <p>The \"Indy Divi\" - and I&#xa0;loved&#xa0;The Sun turned it into a giveaway promotion&#xa0;\"Free Offer\" - is just \u00a3500 less debt in one year, not \u00a3500 in your hand.

Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Robertson rejected a suggestion that an independent Scotland would find it impossible to get rid of nuclear weapons but still join Nato.</strong> \"Well then [if that is not possible] we will be moving for the expulsion of Norway, the expulsion of Denmark, the majority of member states of Nato that do not have nuclear weapons,\" he said. \"No, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said an independent Scotland would want to remove Trident submarines from Faslane partly because it would need the base for its own navy.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t need [nuclear submarines] on the Clyde and for a reason that one doesn\u2019t hear very often on Radio 4 which is that Faslane is our only main naval operating base and we require it for conventional naval defence and that\u2019s what will happen in a sovereign Scotland. We\u2019ll have the defence policy we actually want.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say how long an independent Scotland would give London to remove Trident submarines from the Clyde.</strong> The motion being debated this afternoon, tabled by Robertson, says a Scottish government would negotiate \"the speediest safe transition\" of the nuclear fleet from Faslane. This is what Robertson told Today when asked what this meant.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s different views on how long it would take but in grown-up politics when you accept that issues such as this involve two people and it\u2019s important for us to discuss this with the government of the rest of the United Kingdom after a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote in a referendum. I think it\u2019s important to recognise and be respectful of the fact that this will be a matter for negotiation. I think people in London are beginning to hear that there is resolve in Scotland that we want to see the removal of Trident. Let\u2019s do it in a collegial way and lets\u2019 do it as quickly as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>I've taken the quotes from<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-19T13:08:19.549Z\">at 2.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50811c2158f96784ee290722\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-19T09:23:46.301Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Who said the party conference season was over? In Scotland the governing party, the Scottish National party, is meeting in Perth only days after Alex Salmond and David Cameron signed an agreement paving the way for a referendum on Scottish independence in the autumn of 2014. It is a historic moment for the party and, when Salmond, Scotland's first minister, spoke at the opening of the conference yesterday,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19984633\"> he said 2014 would be the year \"the nonsense ends\".</a> (Presumably he was talking about the wait for independence, not his campaign.) We'll hear more when he delivers his main conference speech tomorrow.</p> <p>The independence referendum will be the backdrop to conference, but we will also get a good, old-fashioned \"fight for the soul of the party\" row when the SNP debates Nato membership this afternoon. For the last 30 years the SNP has argued that an independent Scotland should not belong to Nato. This afternoon the leadership will try to reverse that by getting delegates to support a motion saying that an independent Scotland should remain in Nato provided that it does not host nuclear weapons. It's a debate that involves matters of high principle (the anti-Nato faction argues that, even if Scotland did not have nuclear weapons, it would still be objectionable to belong to an alliance that did) with as well as more grubby electoral considerations<a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scottish-independence-three-quarters-of-scots-back-snp-u-turn-on-nato-membership-1-2426039\"> (75% of Scots want Scotland to stay in Nato,</a> and it is assumed that changing policy would make it easier for Salmond to win the independence referendum.) The leadership is expected to win, but the debate should be a fierce one. Here's an extract from an article that Marco Biagi, one of the eight MSPs who has signed an amendment to the leadership motion saying Scotland should stay out of Nato, wrote <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/opinion/comment/marco-biagi-principles-trump-politics-in-decision-on-nato-1-2584816http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/opinion/comment/marco-biagi-principles-trump-politics-in-decision-on-nato-1-2584816\">in the Scotsman earlier this week.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Party members should, above all, be cautious of the flimsy argument that changing positions to back an independent Scotland\u2019s Nato membership would make a 2014 Yes vote more likely. Such thinking feeds into the false narrative that voting Yes means endorsing only the SNP vision of an independent Scotland. Worse, though, this argument leads to a dangerous \u2013 though in my view false \u2013 perception that a Nato U-turn might be being pursued for political gain rather than out of genuine belief.</p> <p>The question of Nato membership will be an issue for the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament in 2016. Voters will decide on Scotland\u2019s direction in subsequent elections, and the Yes campaign should not be afraid to say so. If voters in an independent Scotland wish to back a party that supports Nato membership, they will have ample chance to do so.</p> <p>SNP defence spokesman Angus Robertson is pursuing this change because he considers Nato membership the best way forward for Scotland. While I do accept some of his arguments, we fundamentally disagree. I believe that we should seek protection through alliances that provide collective security by means other than the threat of the use of nuclear weapons, which underpins all Nato doctrine. As a member, Scotland would be a lone voice for reform in an organisation whose nuclearised stance holds consensus and has persisted long after the end of the Cold War. We must do more than remove nuclear weapons from our own soil. Our objection as a country, rather than \u201cNot in our back yard\u201d should be \u201cNot in our name\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is more on the background to this row <a href=\"http://www.leftfootforward.org/2012/10/snp-conference-split-on-nato-membership/\">on this post on Left Foot Forward.</a></p> <p>Here's the full agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Conference opens. This morning delegates will debate resolutions on economic growth, on Scotland as a hydro nation, on the Scottish government's target to have the equivalent of 100% of Scotland's electricity generated from renewables, on apprenticeships and on higher education and possible financial penalties for universities that do not do more to widen access.</p> <p><em>11.20am:</em> Speech by John Swinney, Scotland's finance secretary.</p> <p><em>11.35am:</em> Debates on the morning resolutions continute.</p> <p><em>2pm:</em> Delegates will debate resolutions on the private rental sector, on the Erasmus student exchange programme, on defence policy and Nato membership, on fishing and on giving more autonomy to island communities.</p> <p><em>4.45pm:</em> Speech by Fiona Hyslop, Scotland's culture secretary.</p> <p>I've just landed in Edinburgh and I won't be in Perth for a while.

  "<p>The last time anyone saw Superman double up on the big screen was when Krypton's favourite son ended up repeatedly whacking himself over the head in 1983's pretty execrable <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/85497/superman-3\" title=\"\">Superman III</a>. Thankfully, there are no plans for a repeat in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/05/superman-man-of-steel-time\" title=\"\">Zack Snyder's forthcoming Man of Steel</a>, but it's looking more and more like we'll be getting double helpings of the character in cinemas before too long. Following a court victory over rights to Superman, Warner Bros this week revealed <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-justice-league-superman-20121018,0,6421111.story\" title=\"\">it will release the long-gestating Justice League movie in cinemas in summer 2015</a> \u2013 coincidentally, the same year that other superhero ensemble combo, The Avengers, are due for a second outing in cinemas.</p> <p>For the uninitiated, the comic-book take on the Justice League features Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, along with assorted minor characters. Warner could plump for the Marvel Studios approach and cast Henry Cavill, the British actor signed to portray Supes in Man of Steel, just as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/robertdowneyjr\" title=\"\">Robert Downey Jr</a> and Chris Hemsworth portrayed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/123770/iron.man\" title=\"\">Iron Man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/139926/thor\" title=\"\">Thor</a> in both standalone movies and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">The Avengers</a>. But even though Justice League is a film that has only really been greenlit due to the $1.5bn success of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/joss-whedon\" title=\"\">Joss Whedon</a>'s superhero epic, I think and hope studio execs will go for a different approach.</p> <p>First of all, there's the problem of Snyder and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/christopher-nolan\" title=\"\">Christopher Nolan</a>'s \"real-world\" approach to Superman for Man of Steel. Out next year, the latest attempt to return Kal-El to cinemas is brought to you by the team behind Nolan's recent Batman trilogy, though the latter is taking a back seat in favour of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126328/watchmen\" title=\"\">Watchmen</a> director Snyder. While co-writer David S Goyer was recently at pains to deny the idea that we'll be getting a \"dark\" Superman, he's been happy to confirm that the new film posits a more realistic take on the world's best-known superhero. A teaser trailer showed a bearded Clark Kent thumbing lifts and doing manual labour somewhere rugged and freezing in north America, and the new Superman outfit <a href=\"http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/blog/post/715944/superman-man-of-steel-close-ups-of-new-outfit/\" title=\"\">is a distinctly muted affair</a>, minus the famous red underpants on the outside. It all points towards an origins story in which the big blue boy scout is \u2013 like Nolan's Batman \u2013 the only superhero in his world, rather than the inhabitant of a more fantastical universe in which lycra-cladded, super-powered crimefighters lurk around every corner. Since that's exactly the kind of world the Justice League is likely to be dead set on saving, it makes sense for the latter film to feature a more traditional version of the character.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wArmHSPIvlQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wArmHSPIvlQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another reason we might be better off seeing two cinematic versions of Superman (and eventually Batman) is that Warner faces a completely different set of circumstances to that of rival Marvel. The latter's advantage when delivering its highly successful series of interconnected comic book movies \u2013 most of them about relatively little-known characters such as Iron Man, Thor and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142811/captain-america\" title=\"\">Captain America</a> \u2013 was that nobody had previously seen these figures on screen in any sort of respected cinematic iterations, if at all. It was therefore possible to deliver a five-year plan in which all appeared in their own origins movie(s) before teaming up for The Avengers. Faced with the task of aping such success with the DC Comics properties to which it owns the rights, Warner Bros is doomed to fail. Superman is about to be re-established via a risky new reboot, and Batman has just finished a successful run in a deeply iconoclastic trilogy which does not even feature characters with traditional superpowers. In the highly unlikely event that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/christianbale\" title=\"\">Christian Bale</a>'s caped crusader were to suddenly appear in the Justice League's orbiting spaceship control room alongside a green-skinned chap from Mars (Justice League member The Martian Manhunter), an alien with seemingly infinite powers (Superman) and a warrior princess with a magic lasso that forces anyone caught in it not to tell porkies (Wonder Woman), we might be entitled to ask a few questions. Warner needs to bite the bullet and accept that its Justice League should feature all-new versions of all of the above.</p> <p>Finally, time is running out. With Justice League set to arrive in 2015, there simply isn't time to integrate Warners' previous versions of Batman and Superman with the new ensemble outing. Warner would have to reboot Batman as part of the new team, with knock-on consequences for the hero's next outing. Again, it makes far more sense to keep the two versions of the caped crusader separate and reap the potential rewards from the success of both versions.</p> <p>There is, of course, a caveat: frankly, I remain doubtful that it makes any sense to bring Justice League to the big screen at all right now. Nevertheless, if Warner must deliver the movie, it ought to do so without destroying any chance of its members appearing in strong solo outings for the next decade or so. In the absence of any other options, the campaign to keep big-screen Batman and Superman separate from their ensemble outings starts here.</p> <p>I'll leave you with the other major comic book movie news this week, in which Marvel's plans for future Iron Man and Thor movies \u2013 in contrast to those of Warner \u2013 continue to roll along smoothly. Here are the official plot synopses for <a href=\"http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=96098\" title=\"\">Iron Man III</a> and <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/10/12/thor-the-dark-world-official-synopsis-revealed\" title=\"\">Thor: The Dark World</a>. Will those films keep the studio at the top of the superhero tree? Or are you one of the few who believes Warner can trump the success of The Avengers with a barnstorming Justice League flick?</p>",
  "<p>The decade-long war in Afghanistan has been the focus of countless books and exhibitions, but there is one view of the conflict that has not been described well \u2013 until now.</p> <p>The Royal British Legion commissioned a photographer to accompany women serving in the most dangerous areas of Afghanistan. The aim was to highlight the roles they perform, which rarely grab the headlines but have become a critical part of the military's strategy.</p> <p>Spending weeks embedded with UK forces in Helmand province, the photographer Alison Baskerville, herself a former member of the RAF, followed two women who had one of the most difficult jobs in the country, though it did not involve shooting at the Taliban. Lieutenant Jessica French, 26, and Captain Anna Crossley, 32, spent six months going into villages and small settlements to talk to the women and try to earn their trust.</p> <p>Male soldiers are forbidden from going into the village compounds. French and Crossley volunteered for the role. \"Most of the women I met didn't leave their compounds,\" said Crossley. \"They hadn't seen a white woman, let along a white western woman in army kit who can speak Pashtu.\"</p> <p>Crossley was stationed in the northern reaches of the Upper Gereshk Valley, one of the most troubled areas of the most troubled province, Helmand. Communities are tightly knit, wary of outsiders, and often sympathetic to the insurgency. But even in such traditionally patriarchal areas, women are trying to get their voices heard, and are beginning to defy their husbands and families to speak out.</p> <p>\"Some of the women we spoke to did not want to talk about the security, but others had very strong opinions about what we should be doing in Afghanistan, and what the Afghans should be doing,\" said French. On most days, French and Crossley would go on patrol with other soldiers.</p> <p>When they approached communities, they would take off their helmets, set aside their weapons, and seek out the wives. \"They are in the frontline, but they have to walk into the compounds, take off their helmets and suddenly become more feminine,\" said Baskerville.</p> <p>Crossley and French said they met some incredibly brave women, some of whom were putting their lives at risk either by speaking out, or deciding to work. A few have even joined the local police.</p> <p>But in the hinterland of the Upper Gureshk valley, time has stood still for decades.</p> <p>\"In the areas where I was working there is still a long way to go,\" said Crossley. \"There are so many things that need to happen. Sadly, they have been a little bit left behind.\"</p> <p>Access to education is the key to a better future for the women of Helmand, said French, who is likely to return to Afghanistan for another six-month tour in 2014.</p> <p>\"It's a tough world,\" she added. \"But some of the women we met were so determined and positive. I hope they have a better future ahead of them.\"</p> <p><em>The White Picture - The Hidden World of Women in Combat can be seen at the Oxo Gallery on the South Bank, London, from 25 October until 11 November, Remembrance Sunday</em></p>",

  "<p>To Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Briana Mihok is gold dust. She ticks the three boxes that qualify her to be exactly the type of voter the presidential candidates are focusing all their attention on as the White House race enters its final three weeks. She is undecided, she lives in an unexpectedly competitive state and \u2013 by far the most important of all \u2013 Mihok is a woman.</p> <p>Presidential elections always come down to a narrow territorial battle for advantage in a handful of swing states. But after almost a year of constant campaigning and millions of dollars of television advertising, it became clear this week that both candidates believe that the defining battle of 2012 is now for female voters. </p> <p>At the second presidential debate on Tuesday night on Long Island, Obama and Romney clashed repeatedly on women's issues, ranging from workplace equality to access to contraception. Romney said women had suffered worse under Obama's economic policies, while the president in turn tied issues like equal pay and healthcare to economic recovery, describing women as important breadwinners in their family. </p> <p>A look at the polls over the last two weeks explains why. Since the first debate, Romney, whose campaign had been faltering, has surged back into contention, <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\">overtaking Obama in some national polls</a>. Behind those headline figures is the first sign of a big shift among women, with Obama's massive advantage cut back to a few points. </p> <p>But for some of the women whose votes the campaigns so openly covet, the sudden intensity of these arguments has done little to clarify matters. </p> <p>Mihok, a mother of one and registered Republican, said she was struck by Romney's ignorance of issues that concern women during Tuesday's debate. </p> <p>She cited the answer he gave to a question about workplace equality in which he said he understood the need to be \"flexible\" in order to have women in the workforce. Giving the example of his chief of staff, who had two children of school age, Romney told the audience at Hofstra university: \"She said: 'I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night: I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.' So we said: 'Fine. Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.'\"</p> <p>Romney's comments were \"weird\", said Mihok, a 32-year-old policy analyst for a non-profit research company at the University of Pittsburgh. She has been leaning towards Obama in recent weeks.</p> <p>\"My husband and I both work, and flexible work hours are just as important to my husband as they are to me,\" she said. \"Unfortunately governor Romney showed a real ignorance when it comes to women's issues.\"</p> <p>Mihok, who did not watch Tuesday's debate but discussed it with friends and read about it afterwards, said Obama put forward a better case for women. \"President Obama, with his background and his upbringing, has the opportunity to see first hand what is important to women and their families. Look at the statement about his grandmother training men for positions for which men got higher pay and better promoted, yet she never had that opportunity. That legacy is still around, and it's important to recognise that.\"</p> <p>But while that's good news for Obama, Mihok said women's issues would not be at the front of her mind when she came to cast her ballot on 6 November.</p> <p>She is not alone. Mihok is one of a number of undecided female voters from Pennsylvania whom the Guardian is talking to over the course of the election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/11/pennsylvania-women-romney-obama\">to find out what is important to them</a>. None of them cited equal pay or social issues as top of the list of things important to their vote, although three out of five cited affordable healthcare as ranking top alongside the economy. </p> <p>\"Who can say what women need or want?\" said Judy Beck, 52, a grandmother and divorced mother of three from O'Hara township in Allegheny County. \"We are really just people.\"</p> <p>The issues most important to Beck's vote are the economy, foreign policy and the partisan makeup of Congress, but she said she did not hear anything on any of these issues that would make her change her mind, she said.</p> <p>Shireen Parsons, 68, a grandmother and community organiser from Summit Hill, Carbon County, was also unconvinced by the efforts to appeal to women. \"I'm old and cranky and sceptical,\" said Parsons, an independent. \"Women voters are smarter than most politicians think. When Romney talked about women, just how many women did he have in his cabinet? I've no idea but I would like to know.\"</p> <h2>'What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?'</h2> <p>Pennsylvania is typically Democratic but the race for its 20 electoral college votes has tightened considerably since the first debate. </p> <p>It has a particularly marked gender divide among voters, as well as a higher pay disparity among men and women. Women earn almost 81\u00a2 to a male worker's dollar, compared to the national average of 82\u00a2.</p> <p>Of the five women, three are Republican, one is a Democrat and one an independent. In the last two weeks, one of the Republicans has decided to vote for Obama, with another two leaning that way. But this week, the Democrat said she is leaning heavily towards Romney.</p> <p>Beck, who is \"principally a Republican\" because of her belief in less government, has made up her mind to vote for Obama over the course of the campaign.</p> <p>She said that the most recent arguments over women from the candidates has \"solidified my leaning towards the Obama campaign\".</p> <p>\"Obama didn't get as specific as Mitt Romney. Romney was too specific and it was apparent he doesn't have a clue. Obama mentioned his mother was a single mother, and he understands there are single mothers who need to make a living and that both men and women need to work.\"</p> <p>Obama answered the equal pay question during Tuesday's debate by referring to his upbringing by a single mother and grandmother who trained men for jobs that paid them more and ranked them higher. He cited the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for women to sue over pay discrimination, as one of his first official acts in office. And he cited childcare tax credits as a factor in whether women can become the breadwinners.</p> <p>\"These are not just women's issues,\" the president said. \"These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.\"</p> <p>These comments chimed with the Pennsylvania women. Romney's answer to the same question was to insist that his record when governor or Massachusetts was one of equality. His description of his efforts to hire women into his cabinet <a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">were pilloried as wrong-footed and false</a>, and he has been widely ridiculed for his \"binders full of women\" remark about female appointments to his cabinet.</p> <p>Beck said that Romney reminds her of an old boss who refused her a raise because he told her \"the married men need it first\".</p> <p>\"That was back in 1987,\" she said. \"It was wrong then, and it is so much more wrong now. Any suggestion that a woman should be paid any differently is ridiculous. What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?</p> <p>\"Romney does not like anyone to disagree with him, You need to be the president but you also need to listen to advice. It seems to me he assumes he has all the answers.\"</p> <p>Like Beck, Parsons said she found herself being more sceptical of Romney than Obama. </p> <p>\"Romney believes that life begins at conception, but he said he wouldn't legislate against a woman's right to abortion. I don't believe that,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Because of Obama's upbringing and who he is and also because of his wife, he tends to do better among women. I'm inclined to trust some things that Obama says than anything Mitt Romney says. I'm not sure why.</p> <p>\"On the other hand I see what Obama has failed to do for women at the bottom layer. He is as much owned by corporate interests as other politicians. They work for corporate interests and leave poor people women and children at the bottom of the heap.\"</p> <p>Joanne Quinn-Smith, 63, a talkshow host, publisher of an online news network and CEO of a marketing company, praised Obama for talking about women as breadwinners. \"If I work as hard as a man I want to get paid like a man,\" she said. </p> <p>She also pointed out the gender pay disparity in Pennsylvania, but said the economy was her number one concern. </p> <p>\"I want someone who can bring us out of this (recession),\" she said. \"Someone who wants to drive business or someone who wants to drive spending that is supported by taxes? I think I just told you where I am leaning. Someone needs to say: 'We've spent enough money, let's re-organise, let's tighten our belts.' Who is better to do that than someone from a business environment?\"</p> <p>Quinn-Smith said that she thought that Romney would be successful in gaining votes among women in higher income brackets.</p> <p>But, despite leaning towards the Republican, she is still not sure. \"In the last Guardian piece someone said, it is about who you hate less.\"</p> <p>She compared the election to a college student \"going home for the weekend and talking to your parents for advice, and you need them to say something wonderful about what's going on and you don't feel any better because you haven't gotten it.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Church of England risks entering a period of \"intensified internal conflict\" that could prove \"publicly embarrassing and internally draining\" if it votes against landmark legislation to allow women to become bishops, <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/2654/women-bishops-enough-waiting\" title=\"\">the Archbishop of Canterbury has warned</a>.</p> <p>At the start of a last-ditch campaign to force through the measure that has divided the Church for more than a decade, Rowan Williams addressed those who remain undecided on whether to vote for or against, despite a re-wording of the legislation by bishops aimed at reconciling those on either side of the debate.</p> <p>Williams, for whom passing the draft legislation at the General Synod next month would mark a significant valedictory triumph before his resignation at the end of the year, defended the measure in the Church Times, arguing that both opponents and supporters of women bishops who have reservations about the legislation should ask themselves whether delaying the vote would be likely to yield a better result.</p> <p>Despite a newly amended draft crafted by the House of Bishops over the summer and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19611998\" title=\"\">presented in September</a>, there remain significant pockets of the Church's voting body who, Williams said, thought the measure in its current form was still \"not quite good enough, or not quite simple enough\". Those who have always argued that women bishops are a theological impossibility remain implacably opposed, with the Anglo-Catholic group Forward in Faith and conservative evangelical group Reform both coming out against.</p> <p>Perhaps more worrying for Lambeth Palace, however, the campaign group Women and the Church (Watch), which has been vigorously lobbying for women to enter the episcopate for years, has said that its members are divided over the issue and that, as a consequence, it is not taking a position.</p> <p>If the measure is voted down next month, the issue will be effectively killed off for years, with another vote not possible for a decade. Williams, who has never made any secret of his desire to see women break through the stained glass ceiling, said on Friday he hoped the Synod would recognise the sense of urgency surrounding the issue and act accordingly.</p> <p>\"Voting against the legislation risks committing us to a period of continued and perhaps intensified internal conflict with no clearly guaranteed outcome,\" he wrote. \"Of course those who believe that the episcopal ministry of women is simply contrary to God's will for the Church of England will vote against, and there should be no unfair pressure on clear consciences. They are voting for what they truly believe is God's purpose for his Church.</p> <p>\"But for those who find it not quite good enough or not quite simple enough, the question must be, 'What are you voting for if you vote against this Measure?' And what if you decide that that the answer is, uncomfortably, a period of publicly embarrassing and internally draining indecision?\"</p> <p>After years of division, the measure allowing women bishops was all set to be passed by the Synod when it met in York in July. But, following a last-minute amendment added by the house of Bishops in the spring, even supporters of the move felt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/05/church-england-vote-women-bishops\" title=\"\">they could not vote for the measure,</a> and instead <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/church-of-england-female-bishops?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">supported an adjournment</a>.</p> <p>Over the summer, the bishops re-worded a clause which Williams admitted had caused \"real hurt and offence\" among many in the Church, and came up with what has since been dubbed the \"Appleby amendment\" after the Reverend Janet Appleby, a vicar from North Tyneside. It said that male bishops and priests appointed to minister to parishes opposed to women bishops should be chosen in a way which respects the reasons why they were requested.</p> <p>Opponents of women bishops have said the wording does not make enough provision for them, while some supporters say it still makes too much. Williams wrote: \"The truth is that the word does have legal content. If you're required to show 'respect', you need to be able to demonstrate that what you do takes account in practice of someone's conviction. You will need to show that it has made a difference to how you act; it doesn't just recommend an attitude or state of mind ('with all due respect\u2026'). The word leaves enough flexibility for appropriate responses to different circumstances, but it isn't so general as to be toothless.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the late summer of 2008, two&#xa0;events in quick succession signalled the end of the New World Order. In August, the US&#xa0;client state of Georgia was crushed in a brief but bloody war&#xa0;after it attacked Russian troops in the contested territory of South Ossetia.</p> <p>The former Soviet republic was a favourite of Washington's neoconservatives. Its authoritarian president had been lobbying hard for Georgia to join Nato's eastward expansion. In an unblinking inversion of reality, US vice-president Dick Cheney denounced Russia's response as an act of \"aggression\" that \"must not go unanswered\". Fresh from unleashing a catastrophic war on Iraq, George Bush declared Russia's \"invasion of a sovereign state\" to be \"unacceptable in the 21st century\".</p> <p>As the fighting ended, Bush warned Russia not to recognise South Ossetia's independence. Russia did exactly that, while US warships were reduced to sailing around the Black Sea. The conflict marked an international turning point. The US's bluff had been called, its military sway undermined by the war on&#xa0;terror, Iraq and Afghanistan. After two decades during which it bestrode the world like a colossus, the years of uncontested US power were over.</p> <p>Three weeks later, a second, still more far-reaching event threatened the heart of the US-dominated global financial system. On 15 September, the credit crisis finally erupted in the collapse of America's fourth-largest investment bank. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers engulfed the western world in its deepest economic crisis since the 1930s.</p> <p>The first decade of the 21st century shook the international order, turning the received wisdom of the global elites on its head \u2013 and 2008 was its watershed. With the end of the cold war, the great political and economic questions had all&#xa0;been settled, we were told. Liberal democracy and free-market capitalism had triumphed. Socialism had been consigned to history. Political controversy would now be confined to culture wars and tax-and-spend trade-offs.</p> <p>In 1990, George Bush Senior had inaugurated a New World Order, based&#xa0;on uncontested US military supremacy and western economic dominance. This was to be a unipolar world without rivals. Regional powers would bend the knee to the new worldwide imperium. History itself, it&#xa0;was said, had come to an end.</p> <p>But between the attack on the Twin Towers and the fall of Lehman Brothers, that global order had crumbled. Two factors were crucial. By the end of a decade of continuous warfare, the US had succeeded in exposing the limits, rather than the extent, of its military power. And the neoliberal capitalist model that had reigned supreme for a generation had crashed.</p> <p>It was the reaction of the US to 9/11 that broke the sense of invincibility of the world's first truly global empire. The Bush administration's wildly miscalculated response turned the atrocities in New York and Washington into the most successful terror attack in history.</p> <p>Not only did Bush's war fail on its own terms, spawning terrorists across the world, while its campaign of killings, torture and kidnapping discredited Western claims to be guardians of human rights. But the US-British invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq revealed the inability of the global behemoth to impose its will on subject&#xa0;peoples prepared to fight back.&#xa0;That became a strategic defeat for&#xa0;the US and its closest allies.</p> <p>This passing of the unipolar moment was the first of four decisive changes that transformed the world \u2013 in some crucial ways for the better. The second was the fallout from the crash of 2008 and the crisis of the western-dominated capitalist order it unleashed, speeding up relative US decline.</p> <p>This was a crisis made in America and&#xa0;deepened by the vast cost of its multiple wars. And its most devastating impact was on those economies whose elites had bought most enthusiastically into the neoliberal orthodoxy of deregulated financial markets and unfettered corporate power.</p> <p>A voracious model of capitalism forced down the throats of the world as the only way to run a modern economy, at a cost of ballooning inequality and environmental degradation, had been discredited \u2013 and only rescued from collapse by the greatest state intervention in history. The baleful twins of neoconservatism and neoliberalism had been tried and tested to destruction.</p> <p>The failure of both accelerated the rise of China, the third epoch-making change of the early 21st century. Not only did the country's dramatic growth take hundreds of millions out of poverty, but its state-driven investment model rode out the west's slump, making a mockery of market orthodoxy and creating a new centre of global power. That increased the freedom of manoeuvre for smaller states.</p> <p>China's rise widened the space for the&#xa0;tide of progressive change that swept Latin America \u2013 the fourth global advance. Across the continent, socialist and social-democratic governments were propelled to power, attacking economic and racial injustice, building regional independence and taking back resources from corporate control. Two&#xa0;decades after we had been assured there could be no alternatives to neoliberal capitalism, Latin Americans were creating them.</p> <p>These momentous changes came, of&#xa0;course, with huge costs and qualifications. The US will remain the overwhelmingly dominant military power for the foreseeable future; its partial defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan were paid for in death and destruction on a colossal scale; and multipolarity brings its own risks of conflict. The neoliberal model was discredited, but governments tried to refloat it through savage austerity programmes. China's success was bought at a high price in inequality, civil rights and environmental destruction. And Latin America's US-backed elites remained determined to reverse the social gains, as they succeeded in doing by violent coup in Honduras in 2009. Such contradictions also beset the revolutionary upheaval that engulfed the Arab world in 2010-11, sparking another shift of global proportions.</p> <p>By then, Bush's war on terror had become such an embarrassment that the&#xa0;US government had to change its&#xa0;name to \"overseas contingency operations\". Iraq was almost universally acknowledged to have been a disaster, Afghanistan a doomed undertaking. But&#xa0;such chastened realism couldn't be further from how these campaigns were regarded in the western mainstream when they were first unleashed.</p> <p>To return to what was routinely said by British and US politicians and their tame pundits in the aftermath of 9/11 is&#xa0;to be transported into a parallel universe of toxic fantasy. Every effort was made to discredit those who rejected the case for invasion and occupation \u2013 and would before long be&#xa0;comprehensively vindicated.</p> <p>Michael Gove, now a Tory cabinet minister, poured vitriol on the Guardian for publishing a full debate on the attacks, denouncing it as a \"Prada-Meinhof gang\" of \"fifth columnists\". Rupert Murdoch's Sun damned those warning against war as \"anti-American propagandists of the fascist left\". When the Taliban regime was overthrown, Blair issued a triumphant condemnation of those (myself included) who had opposed the invasion of Afghanistan and war on terror. We had, he declared, \"proved to be wrong\".</p> <p>A decade later, few could still doubt that it was Blair's government that had \"proved to be wrong\", with catastrophic consequences. The US and its allies would fail to subdue Afghanistan, critics&#xa0;predicted. The war on terror would itself spread terrorism. Ripping up civil rights would have dire consequences \u2013 and an occupation of Iraq would be a blood-drenched disaster.</p> <p>The war party's \"experts\", such as the&#xa0;former \"viceroy of Bosnia\" Paddy Ashdown, derided warnings that invading Afghanistan would lead to a \"long-drawn-out guerrilla campaign\" as&#xa0;\"fanciful\". More than 10 years on, armed resistance was stronger than ever&#xa0;and the war had become the longest in American history.</p> <p>It was a similar story in Iraq \u2013 though opposition had by then been given voice by millions on the streets. Those who stood against the invasion were still accused of being \"appeasers\". US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld predicted the war would last six days. Most of the Anglo-American media expected resistance to collapse in short order. They were entirely wrong.</p> <p>A new colonial-style occupation of Iraq would, I wrote in the first week of&#xa0;invasion, \"face determined guerrilla resistance long after Saddam Hussein has gone\" and the occupiers \"be driven&#xa0;out\". British troops did indeed face unrelenting attacks until they were&#xa0;forced out in 2009, as did US regular troops until they were withdrawn in 2011.</p> <p>But it wasn't just on the war on terror&#xa0;that opponents of the New World Order were shown to be right and its cheerleaders to be talking calamitous nonsense. For 30 years, the west's elites&#xa0;insisted that only deregulated markets, privatisation and low taxes on&#xa0;the wealthy could deliver growth and&#xa0;prosperity.</p> <p>Long before 2008, the \"free market\" model had been under fierce attack: neoliberalism was handing power to unaccountable banks and corporations, anti-corporate globalisation campaigners argued, fuelling poverty and social injustice and eviscerating democracy \u2013 and was both economically and ecologically unsustainable.</p> <p>In contrast to New Labour politicians who claimed \"boom and bust\" to be a thing of the past, critics dismissed the idea that the capitalist trade cycle could be abolished as absurd. Deregulation, financialisation and the reckless promotion of debt-fuelled speculation would, in fact, lead to crisis.</p> <p>The large majority of economists who predicted that the neoliberal model was heading for breakdown were, of course, on the left. So while in Britain the main political parties all backed \"light-touch regulation\" of finance, its opponents had long argued that City liberalisation threatened the wider economy.</p> <p>Critics warned that privatising public services would cost more, drive down pay and conditions and fuel corruption. Which is exactly what happened. And in the European Union, where corporate privilege and market orthodoxy were embedded into treaty, the result was ruinous. The combination of liberalised banking with an undemocratic, lopsided and deflationary currency union that critics (on both left and right in this case) had always argued risked breaking apart was a disaster waiting to happen. The crash then provided the trigger.</p> <p>The case against neoliberal capitalism had been overwhelmingly made on the left, as had opposition to the US-led wars of invasion and occupation. But it was strikingly slow to capitalise on its vindication over the central controversies of the era. Hardly surprising, perhaps, given the loss of confidence that flowed from the left's 20th-century defeats \u2013 including in its own social alternatives.</p> <p>But driving home the lessons of these disasters was essential if they were not to be repeated. Even after Iraq and Afghanistan, the war on terror was pursued in civilian-slaughtering drone attacks from Pakistan to Somalia. The western powers played the decisive role in the overthrow of the Libyan regime \u2013 acting in the name of protecting civilians, who then died in their thousands in a Nato-escalated civil war, while conflict-wracked Syria was threatened with intervention and Iran with all-out attack.</p> <p>And while neoliberalism had been discredited, western governments used&#xa0;the crisis to try to entrench it. Not&#xa0;only were jobs, pay and benefits cut as never before, but privatisation was extended still further. Being right was, of course, never going to be enough. What was needed was political and social pressure strong enough to turn the tables of power.</p> <p>Revulsion against a discredited elite&#xa0;and its failed social and economic project steadily deepened after 2008. As&#xa0;the burden of the crisis was loaded on to the majority, the spread of protests, strikes and electoral upheavals demonstrated that pressure for real change had only just begun. Rejection of&#xa0;corporate power and greed had become the common sense of the age.</p> <p>The historian Eric Hobsbawm described the crash of 2008 as a \"sort of right-wing equivalent to the fall of the Berlin wall\". It was commonly objected that after the implosion of communism and traditional social democracy, the left had no systemic alternative to offer. But no model ever came pre-cooked. All&#xa0;of them, from Soviet power and the Keynesian welfare state to Thatcherite-Reaganite neoliberalism, grew out of ideologically driven improvisation in specific historical circumstances.</p> <p>The same would be true in the aftermath of the crisis of the neoliberal order, as the need to reconstruct a broken economy on a more democratic, egalitarian and rational basis began to dictate the shape of a sustainable alternative. Both the economic and ecological crisis demanded social ownership, public intervention and a shift of wealth and power. Real life was pushing in the direction of progressive solutions.</p> <p>The upheavals of the first years of the 21st century opened up the possibility of&#xa0;a new kind of global order, and of genuine social and economic change. As&#xa0;communists learned in 1989, and the&#xa0;champions of capitalism discovered 20 years later, nothing is ever settled.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from The Revenge of History: the Battle for the 21st Century by Seumas Milne, published by Verso.

  "<p>After a ten year transatlantic legal battle, Theresa May gritted her teeth and used the Human Rights Act to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-not-extradited-may\">block the extradition of Gary McKinnon</a> to the US.

The trick is to not use the word governance...</p> <p>Google's <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104413069545565696542\">David Drummond </a>stuck up well for Google's position in support of the open web, which might support the company's business position but, he argues, also provides opportunities for the developing world. We need an open internet for innovation to flourish.</p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/102033129777839332130\">Alexander Ntoko</a> from the International Telecommunication Union did a good job explaining how the organisation works. Why shouldn't the public look to their governments to protect them from cybersecurity threats? That's fine as long as you trust your government. But, he said, ITU proposals also reflect international law, so defused the criticism that some proposals would threaten free speech. ITU is subject to Article 33, for example.</p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109913625686513025659\">Alice Munyua</a> from many places, but especially Kenyan government internet policy, was a much needed voice on the needs of the developing world. She said the internet in Africa was growing but still has low levels of access, with only 40 million users in Kenya. Trying to increase access to affordable broadband was still a big issue, and the ITU was important in helping this, but we should be able to collaborate internationally to deal with issues of cybercrime to protect the vulnerable such as young girls who might not know how to protect themselves. </p> <p>And <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114883350507853176436\">Eleanor Saitta</a>, most recently with the International Modern Media Institute, explained how the internet is under threat of militarisation, so how can we trust governments to protect us when they are simultaneously engaging in cyber-sabotage and surveillance \u2013 sometimes against their own citizens? No single organisation, she says, can impose a top down governance on the internet because it is a self-organising network. </p> <p>Is it in the interest of the public that the internet is fragmented into political, corporate or ethical sub-domains? The answer was equivocal \u2013 the internet must stay together. That's one valuable conclusion on a debate that ended on a high. The goose that laid the golden egg is safe for now.</p>",
  "<p>Muammar Gaddafi's former spy chief should be tried by the international criminal court (ICC) and not in Libya, where he has been denied legal representation since being handed over by Mauritania six weeks ago, his family has said.</p> <p>Abdullah al-Senussi, for decades the Libyan leader's feared right-hand man and security supremo, is now in prison in Tripoli. His daughter says he is in poor health and fears he may have been tortured while being held incommunicado and questioned about his alleged crimes.</p> <p>\"My father has no lawyer and no one has been allowed to see or speak to him in the 44 days since he was taken back to Tripoli,\" Sara al-Senussi told the Guardian. \"I tried to find a Libyan lawyer but no one wants to take the case because they are frightened. That is another problem.\"</p> <p>The ICC indicted Senussi last year, along with Gaddafi and his son Saif al-Islam, on two counts of crimes against humanity \u2013 murder and persecution \u2013 allegedly committed in the eastern city of Benghazi.</p> <p>The Libyan government says he is entitled to legal counsel but is adamant he must face justice in his native land, where he would face the death penalty.</p> <p>Senussi, 64, is Gaddafi's brother-in-law. He was head of Libya's external security organisation (ESO) in 1988 when the Lockerbie bombing took place. Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the only man convicted over the bombing, was believed by Britain and the US to have been an ESO officer. In Libya Senussi is widely blamed for a massacre at the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli in 1966, in which 1,200 inmates were killed.</p> <p>\"I want the questioning to be carried out in an open and transparent way so that everyone can listen and see who Abdullah Senussi really is,\" his daughter said. \"Even Superman could not have done all the things they accuse my father of. The ICC is better because they have rules and lawyers. In Libya there is nothing. It's all militias. There's no government, nothing.\"</p> <p>Senussi's younger daughter al-Unood has been imprisoned in Libya since entering the country on a false passport this month. \"She is a crazy girl,\" said her sister. \"She wanted to try to help our father and she wanted to get a lawyer. She didn't tell anyone she was going.\"</p> <p>Senussi fled Tripoli after it fell to the Nato-backed rebels, crossing into Niger and then Morroco. He was detained while trying to enter Mauritania while disguised as a Tuareg chieftain and carrying a fake passport. It is rumoured that Libya paid for him to be handed over.</p> <p>Speaking from Cairo, Sara al-Senussi described how her father was surrendered to Libyan officials in Nouakchott on 5 September after being told without warning that he was being summoned to see the Mauritanian president.</p> <p>\"He was taken to the airport and when he saw a plane with the Libyan flag he understood what was happening,\" she said. \"I am worried about his health. In Nouakchott he had a prostrate problem and before that he had liver cancer. That could come back at any time. He was also depressed and didn't eat.\"</p> <p>An informed source who witnessed his interrogation told a Libyan journalist: \"Senussi is still in a state of shock and keeps alternating between shock and anger. But it's only a matter of time till he comes to grip with what has happened.\"</p> <p>Senussi is facing separate military and civilian investigations in a prison run by the Tripoli military council. Legal sources said there was confusion over the case because a new Libyan justice minister had yet to be appointed. Last week in The Hague, Libyan lawyers told ICC judges that Senussi and Saif would be tried together in March 2013.</p> <p>Complicating the question of jurisdiction, the ICC indictment covers only crimes committed after February 2011, so the Abu Salim case is not included.</p> <p>Under international law Libya is obliged to permit detainees legal counsel and access to relatives. \"This is a recurrent and rampant problem in Libya nowadays,\" said Geraldine Mattioli-Zeltner, of Human Rights Watch. \"It is definitely a problem for high-profile defendants like Senussi and Saif and for thousands of others.\"</p> <p>Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, of Amnesty International, said: \"Trying Senussi in Libya, where the justice system remains weak and fair trials are still out of reach, undermines the right of victims to see justice and reparation. Instead, he should face the ICC's charges of crimes against humanity in fair proceedings. A year after the end of hostilities, victims of serious human rights abuses \u2013 by the former government as well as its opponents \u2013 have yet to see justice. What we witness today in Libya is revenge and not justice.\"</p>",
  "<p>Heading into the playoffs for a 51st time, the New York Yankees had every reason to think they could succeed. They had overcome the early season loss of their all-everything closer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/04/mariano-rivera-torn-acl-new-york-yankees\">Mariano Rivera</a> and a host of other nagging injuries throughout the season, winning 95 games, staving off the pesky Orioles in taking yet another American League East title. They were to face Baltimore in the ALDS, a formality, and then play the winner of the Detroit and Oakland series. There were no pesky rivals to speak of, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/04/boston-red-sox-bobby-valentine-fired\">Boston Red Sox finished in the cellar</a>, the Los Angeles Angels were shut out of the postseason, and the O's had upset the Texas Rangers in the wild-card game. The path was seemingly clear for the Yankees to make it to the World Series at the very least, and their fans could be forgiven for daydreaming about a 28th championship coming to the Bronx. </p> <p>What followed was one of the most bizarre unravelings the sport has ever seen - a lineup that scored the second most runs in the American League and hit the most homers, disintegrated into an outfit that, and no exaggeration here, simply did not belong in Major League Baseball. New York scored five runs in the ninth inning against Baltimore in Game One of the ALDS, and it wasn't until Game One of the ALCS, five games later, that they were able to score multiple runs in another inning. In Game Four vs. Detroit, they had two hits and struck out 12 times. They were, pathetic, exposed to all as an old, rickety and punchless team. Done. </p> <p>Who could have guessed before this postseason began that the New York Yankees dynasty would crumble before our eyes, that they would be facing an offseason of unprecedented introspection after being crushed in the ALCS by a team that won 88 games in the weak Central Division, and taken to the limit by, of all ball clubs, the Baltimore Orioles. </p> <p>When a team makes the playoffs in 17 out of 18 years you believe success is forever - in Yankee-land, you don't believe playoff droughts are possible. Certainly not in the era of $200m payrolls anyway. Then you witness what we saw this October and it all crystallizes before you. It's over, the way it was over in 1965 when an 11-year playoff absence began, in 1982 when New York began a stretch of 12 seasons without playoff baseball. </p> <p>The Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers didn't have a pitching staff of Bob Gibson's and Sandy Koufax's (although Justin Verlander is close), but it looked like it when Robinson Cano had three hits in 41 plate appearances, Curtis Granderson had three hits in 33 plate appearances, Nick Swisher didn't show up, again, and Mark Teixeira had exactly one extra base hit. Then there was Alex Rodriguez, who by virtue of his enormous salary and lightning rod personality, became, perhaps unfairly, the grandest symbol of the playoff failure. He struck out 12 times in six games and had just three hits. A-Rod struggled from the start, and went from potentially being dropped in the lineup to fifth, to being pinch hit for in big spots, to being benched, while attempting to navigate the latest firestorm while attempting to <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2012/10/18/alex-rodriguez-flirting-woman-game-kyna-treacy/\">pick up models. </a></p> <p>Had the Yankees simply been upset by the Orioles, perhaps they could have ignored what was coming for a bit longer. They wouldn't have been around to be embarrassed in a second consecutive series after being beaten by a team of destiny, a more acceptable outcome in sports. Instead, the undressing continued against Detroit, and worse, injury was added to the insults. In Game One, after Raul Ibanez provided more ninth inning miracles, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/8516869/derek-jeter-new-york-yankees-surgery-ankle-4-5-months\">Derek Jeter shattered his ankle.</a> The Captain, the unprecedented symbol of the franchise, was helped off the field at Yankee Stadium. Hope was lost without him, and Detroit continued to slice through New York's lineup without a fight. </p> <p>Now Joe Girardi's Yankees board a flight to New York empty handed, facing major issues across their roster. Can the aging Jeter play shortstop next season after suffering such an injury, and if so, can he produce another season like he did in 2012? Will Andy Pettitte return at age 41? Will Rivera make a full recovery and be re-signed? First baseman Mark Teixeira is in a major decline, center fielder Curtis Granderson has become a hit and mostly miss player, right fielder Nick Swisher, a free agent, is likely gone, Ichiro, also a free agent, could return but will be 39. Outfielder Raul Ibanez, one of the only Yankees to hit in the postseason is not an everyday player. Catcher Russell Martin can't hit a lick and can also be a free agent. Alex Rodriguez' numbers spiralled out of control, and was then punished by Yankees management for not producing in the playoffs or in the regular season (17 homers). It seems to be a forgone conclusion that he will be moved but with five years and $114m remaining on his contract, however, it will take some real creativity from GM Brian Cashman, and/or some major cash eating for New Yorkers to see the back of unlucky 13 this offseason. </p> <p>With an average age of 33, and gaping holes in their roster, and no guarantees that throwing money at problems will be able to fix their major shortcomings, there is every reason to believe that at best, the Yankees will have an outside shot at a playoff spot next season. More realistically, the Yankees are in line to finish 2013 with a losing record, which would be the first time the team finished sub .500 since 1992, and put an end to a nearly two decade old baseball dynasty in the Bronx.</p> <p>There are no easy fixes but I think we could speculate and ask ourselves, WWGD, or what would George do? George being the departed former Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who moved both heaven and earth to try to compete, regularly failing. He may have signed Josh Hamilton to whatever he wants, then resigned Ichiro and move Granderson to a corner outfield position. Or perhaps he would trade Granderson and sign Michael Bourn. Make Jeter the Designated Hitter? Bring in Mike Napoli to catch and eat A-Rod's contract? Who knows, it's all speculation of course. One thing we do know is that the Yankees want to stay competitive and get under the $190m luxury tax threshold coming in 2014, and that will be no easy trick.</p>",
  "<p>The number of women and children raped in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has risen dramatically because of a surge in rebel militia activity, according to a local health organisation <a href=\"http://www.healafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sexual-violence-targets-children-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.healafrica.org\" title=\"\">Heal Africa</a>, which runs a hospital for rape victims in the eastern city of Goma, said it had registered 2,517 cases in the first half of this year. The total comprised 2,339 females \u2013 105 of whom became pregnant \u2013 and 178 males. The number of perpetrators was 2,134.</p> <p>There has been a sharp increase in sexual violence in recent months, Heal Africa added, although figures since June are not yet available.</p> <p>A six-month uprising by the rebel group M23, led by war crimes suspect Bosco \"the Terminator\" Ntaganda, has caused fresh turmoil in eastern Congo and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. A UN <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/rwanda-minister-leader-congo-rebels-kabarebe\" title=\"\">report claims the rebellion is being supported by neighbouring Rwanda</a>.</p> <p>Emmanuel Baabo, leader of Heal Africa's project dealing with sexual violence, said: \"The numbers are rising because several armed groups \u2013 not only the M23 \u2013 have increased their activities over several months. In times of fighting you usually see also rape, refugees, stealing, killing and the burning of houses going up.</p> <p>\"The staff of Heal Africa are frustrated to see all this. We are working for a change in Congo and now it is getting worse. And of course you are always thinking: 'What has happened to this girl can happen tomorrow to my sister, daughter or wife.'\"</p> <p>Heal Africa did not have comparative statistics for last year, but said the 745 child victims it recorded marks a significant shift.</p> <p>Baabo said: \"More and more children are being raped. The reasons are disrespect of children's rights, brutalisation of society as a consequence of the unrest in eastern Congo for such a long time, and also some cultural and traditional habits. For example, some people think that they can be healed from Aids if they sleep with a child.\"</p> <p>The health organisation said an estimated two thirds of women and girls in North Kivu province had experienced sexual violence. Its work is now being hindered by the renewed fighting as some villages are not longer accessible.</p> <p>Baabo added: \"We had also some cases where some armed men stopped our car and stole money and mobile phones. They even took a driver, went with him in the forest and held a gun to his head saying they will kill him. Luckily they let him go, but he was very afraid.</p> <p>\"Several armed groups also have road blocks, stop cars and ask for money or food. In some villages which are occupied by some armed groups they take you in some office and interrogate you for hours.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1440 Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press and in doing so put a huge amount of monks out of business. Many of them had dedicated their lives to copying things out of one book into another, a job that in the 21st century can just as easily be done by a photocopier or an online journalist. The monks had to go back to making rank outmoded spirits and lethally strong beer, thems the breaks, the mass production of words had arrived.</p> <p>Similarly, in the 1930s, the invention of television meant that the radio \u2013 once the focal point of family gatherings in the corner of the lounge \u2013 was a medium relegated to second class status. No longer would normal people engage with the wireless, it was now just something that long distance truck drivers, insomniacs, the army, the incredibly poor and unfathomably weird would use in untidy sheds whilst plotting atrocities.

What is more, once something is committed to print, a journalist and an editor are forced to stand by what they've written \u2013 that, as a toasted Californian might say, is not cool.</p> <p>In the 21st century, facts are fluid, and we need a new media that represents this new way of doing things. Why rely on untidy hidden-away corrections columns in newspapers when at the swipe of a mouse an entire story can be removed or rewritten? That is that is our bright future.</p> <p>Wikipedia has taught us that we no longer need books, for all the world's knowledge has been collated by a mysterious charity in one place for us. I am a firm believer that the truth will out \u2013 and so it stands to reason that not only will Wiki always be correct, but so, too, would all newspapers if they were run in the same way.</p> <p>And so I say this; let us go a step further than simply smashing the printing presses which have held back human progress for the last half a millennium, let the newspapers go online, but make them peer edited. Only then will they truly become organs of truth \u2013 and we will have more trees left to make important things like safety matches and ornamental bar globes with.</p> <p>No rich man can control the media, if the media controls itself. Why have we not reached this conclusion earlier? Because rich men control the media. This is no tautology, this is an undeniable universal truth, the sort that Kant would put in his categorical imperative and smoke were he still with us.</p> <p>Yes, I am a rich man and, yes, I control my own little piece of paradise, but I would happily give it all up tomorrow to be released from my Panamanian prison cell \u2013 and to see this brave new world emerge from the ashes of the fourth estate inferno we have allowed to blaze beneath our noses for far too long.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780393330472\" title=\"\">The Blind Side is a book by Michael Lewis</a> about two things: the development of the left tackle position in American football from being just another grunt in the 1980s to the second highest-paid position in the sport, and Michael Oher's journey from being a giant homeless kid to playing in the NFL. There are some interesting parallels to be drawn between left tackle and tighthead prop and, although the Irish prop Mike Ross comes from Fermoy rather than the mean streets of Memphis, between him and Oher.</p> <p>In January 2003 UCD played Cork Con at Belfield in an All-Ireland League Division One match. UCD's tighthead was 24, 6ft 2in and an undersized 16-and-a-half stone. Con's No3 was 23, 6ft 2in and carrying a soft 21 stone. The UCD prop hit a lot of rucks, made a few carries, made his tackles, looked a bit shaky in the scrum. The Con prop only occasionally broke into an awkward looking trot. He didn't make it to many rucks and didn't touch the ball.</p> <p>I was the UCD tighthead and after another year and a half of mediocrity, I packed in rugby with two herniated discs in my neck (two fewer than Phil Vickery apparently; we now share a neck doctor). The Con tighthead was Ross, who developed into one of the best tightheads in Europe. It was his injury in the first scrum against England at Twickenham in March, and eventual withdrawal after 35 minutes, which led to Ireland's humiliation.</p> <p>Tighthead prop may be the most important position in rugby. If your tighthead retreats a foot on your own ball, your fly-half will have their openside in his face. If your tighthead goes back more than that, as we saw at Twickenham, it's turnovers, penalties and, every prop's worst nightmare, the penalty try.</p> <p>So what makes a good tighthead? To answer this question, we should take a leaf out of another Lewis book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780393324815\" title=\"\">Moneyball</a>. It is easy to be distracted by statistics such as how quickly a prop or baseball player can run 30 yards or how much he can bench-press. Billy Beane's Damascene moment was realising that the only really important statistic for baseball hitters was how often they got on base. Similarly, tighthead props should be analysed first and foremost by their ability in the scrum.</p> <p>Like tighthead prop, left tackle is a key position, in this case as he protects the quarterback's vulnerable blindside. If your left tackle gets beaten, your quarterback ends up injured. The ideal left tackle is 6ft 5in plus, 22-stone plus and has great agility, long arms, flexible hips, good balance and an explosive burst. That is a very small sub-section of the human race. Oher meets those criteria and, when he first met a scout in 2004, was immediately marked down as a first-round NFL draft left tackle. This was despite the fact that Oher had just started playing football.</p> <p>Starting NFL left tackles now earn an average of $4m (\u00a32.5m) per season, almost twice as much as the other linemen (the equivalent of rugby's front row) and $1m per annum behind the quarterback. Its simple economics: importance of asset + scarcity of supply&#xa0;= inflated price. As the importance of tighthead has become more and more apparent, the same economic principles have served to drive up their value. Rugby salaries are light years away from the NFL but, with Toulon paying Carl Hayman a reported \u00a3550,000 per year to sit on their bench, people have started to take notice.</p> <p>Let's answer the key question: how do we recognise and develop players who can become international quality tightheads? Mike Ross was 26 before Harlequins spotted his potential. Why did he end up plying his trade against jokers like me until then? What attributes should the game be looking for? It's not possible to judge accurately on the scrummaging ability of young props, as restricted scrums and differing rates of physical development can hide a lot at underage level. As with Oher, it's the potential for greatness, not the current performance level, that should be looked at.</p> <p>But rugby does not benefit from an NFL-quality scouting system, and good tightheads seem do come in all shapes and sizes. How do you reconcile Adam Jones and Hayman? The received wisdom was that you could not play tighthead with a long back, but Hayman, Martin Castrogiovanni, Dan Cole and many of the other top current tightheads are 6ft 2in or more. Tightheads do have to be able to scrummage low, but big guys can get down there provided they are flexible in the hips and strong in the lower back.</p> <p>Cobus Visagie, one of the best scrummaging tightheads of recent years, has a theory that the ideal tighthead has slim shoulders and a barrel chest. Of course there are still no guarantees. Oher hasn't made it as a left tackle in the NFL and has had to move to the less well-paid right side.</p> <p>Economics will probably have a role to play in encouraging more big young athletes with flexible hips, narrow shoulders and barrel chests to focus on tighthead prop and the contracts they could earn as professionals. And, perhaps most importantly, enough parents need to be encouraged to allow their strapping young sons into the front row \u2013 notwithstanding the almost inevitable herniated discs and cauliflower ears that will follow.</p> <p><em>Ian Lynam is a sports law partner for Charles Russell LLP \u2013 </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianlynam\" title=\"\"><em>@ianlynam</em></a><em> </em></p>",

  "<p>Whistleblowing is relevant in the UK now more than ever, as the recent stream of high profile cover-ups and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/23/welfare-to-work-fraud-whistleblowers-gagged\" title=\"\">relentless clamp downs on truth tellers</a> has shown. The Hillsborough Inquiry, the string of serious problems in the NHS and related health agencies, the recently revealed Ministry of Defence internal document gagging whistleblowers from revealing wrongdoing to their own MPs. The list of examples goes on and on. They illustrate exactly why we need whistleblowers in society in the first place.</p> <p>Whistleblowing is when members of an organisation reveal inside information about serious wrongdoing to someone they believe can act on it. Whistleblowers don't have to be employees; they can be members of a school or church community organisation, for example. A good example of this is the whistleblowers who stepped forward to confirm incidents of paedophilia in Catholic institutions over the past decade.</p> <p>The word whistleblower used to evoke images of shady characters whispering secrets in dark car parks. Now it's increasingly seen as central to a healthy democracy. This trend in public attitude is happening simultaneously around the globe. A 2012 random sample <a href=\"http://www.newspoll.com.au/\" title=\"\">Newspoll survey in Australia</a> of 1,211 people showed that 81% believed whistleblowers should be protected and not punished, even if they reveal inside information.</p> <p>The advent of online leaks news sites like WikiLeaks have likely played a role in this. There are more than 15 leaks-related sites with another, <a href=\"https://ljost.org/\" title=\"\">Ljost</a> (or 'light' in Icelandic) officially launched by the <a href=\"http://associated.whistle.is/\" title=\"\">The Associate Whistleblowing Press</a> on 30 September.</p> <p>Technology such as anonymising software like <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" title=\"\">Tor</a>, free file encryption programs such as <a href=\"http://www.gnupg.org/\" title=\"\">GPG</a>, and access to journalists via Twitter have all converged to make fertile ground for 21st century whistleblowing. It's faster, easier and doesn't involve any dark car parks.</p> <p>This may be why western governments are running crackdowns against whistleblowers with a vehemence rarely seen in recent history. The Obama administration has gone in hard against alleged whistleblowers and in some cases journalists. The target list includes former US NSA senior executive Thomas Drake, army private <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bradley-manning?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Bradley Manning</a> and reporter James Risen.</p> <p>Governments are now also frequently turning technology inward to spy on employees and others in an effort to thwart whistleblowing to the media. So while whistleblowing has become easier, spying technology has also made it riskier to do online.</p> <p>However, it appears the public is becoming impatient with governments that spend all their time on whistleblower witch hunts instead of punishing the underlying wrongdoing. There also seems to be a growing sense of unfairness with the David and Goliath battles, where the little guy trying to do the right thing is so outgunned from the start.</p> <p>Whistleblowing tends to go hand in hand with coverups. The independent panel investigating the Hillsborough tragedy in which 96 football fans died found that police had not only lied about what happened, they had deliberately altered evidence of those who tried to tell the truth. Public outrage at the cover up was so great prime minister David Cameron had to apologise to the victims' families.</p> <p>Like Hillsborough, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/mid-staffordshire-nhs-trust?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Mid Staffordshire NHS Inquiry</a> highlights growing public concern over wrongdoing and coverups. In following up reports of unusually high hospital mortality rates, an independent inquiry criticised the Stafford Hospital's handling of patients. The few whistleblowers who dared to stand up were ignored or suffered retaliation. Another apology from the PM had to be made, again to the victims and families.</p> <p>Britain now waits for the results of a new, wider public inquiry chaired by Robert Francis QC. The final report, including review of the million-plus pages of evidence, was due to be released this month. However Francis recently announced that the report would not now be delivered until early 2013. There is skepticism among health workers as to whether this inquiry \u2013 the fifth \u2013 will truly be fearless in seeking to fix the sick system.</p> <p>The NHS and related health agencies' woes have continued to mount with two high-profile whistleblowing cases pointing to more allegations of wrongdoing. In the first, radiology service manager Sharmila Chowdhury revealed allegations that doctors were being paid to see NHS patients while they were actually moonlighting with their own private patients. Ealing Hospital NHS Trust sacked Ms Chowdhury but a Watford employment tribunal judge ordered that she be reinstated. She has subsequently been made redundant \u2013 after facing legal fees of more than \u00a3100,000 to defend herself.</p> <p>In a second case, a non-executive director of the regulator the Care Quality Commission (<a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CQC</a>), Kay Sheldon, faced accusations of being 'mentally ill' and attempts to sack her after she blew the whistle at a public inquiry into CQC. This is a classic response to whistleblowers: they are either 'bad' or 'mad' and thus their criticisms must not be valid.</p> <p>While whistleblowers play an important role in revealing wrongdoing to the public, there is surprisingly little academic research on whistleblowing to the media, and even less on the role of technology in it. I am the principal researcher on an international study team that hopes to shed light on how technology is impacting on whistleblowing, particularly to the news organisations. In addition to interviewing whistleblowers and the investigative journalists who interact with them, we are also running a detailed online survey.</p> <p><a href=\"https://whistleblowingsurvey.org\" title=\"\">The World Online Whistleblowing Survey</a> (WOWs) is the first online survey aimed at gauging the general public's attitudes to whistleblowing that is being run in so many languages. The anonymous survey is available in 11 languages and is open to everyone to participate, not just whistleblowers.</p> <p>The study team includes researchers from Griffith University and the University of Melbourne in Australia, and Georgetown University in the US. Early data from the online survey points strongly to a public belief among both Australian and British respondents that there is too much secrecy in organisations (a breathtaking 90% in both cases).</p> <p>However, British respondents were more cynical than Australians about the usefulness of official channels for reporting wrongdoing in organisations.</p> <p>About 38% of Australians believed that going to authorities via official channels was the best way to stop serious wrongdoing while only 15% of respondents from the UK agreed. Instead 43% of UK respondents thought going to the media was the most effective way, compared to 27% of Australians.</p> <p>The increasing importance of whistleblowing in the health area is evidenced by <a href=\"http://bma.org.uk/events/2012/october/ protecting-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">a recent conference</a> on the topic run jointly between the British Medical Association and the Patients First group. Whistleblower pediatrician Dr Kim Holt, a speaker at the event, co-founded Patients First in response to the persistent mistreatment of whistleblowers in health. She said UK legislation did not properly defend whistleblowers, and it needed to be amended to address problems such as whistleblowers facing employer 'gag' clauses on revealing wrongdoing and huge legal defence costs.</p> <p>It's clear whistleblowing is an important part of a participatory democracy, yet many still remain confused about what value governments and legal scholars place on it. Time will tell what influence cases such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Wikileaks</a> and the NHS will have on this value, but one thing seems likely \u2013 despite facing often draconian measures, whistleblowers are increasingly winning public support.</p> <p><em>Sulette Dreyfus is a research fellow at </em><a href=\"http://www.unimelb.edu.au/\" title=\"\"><em>The University of Melbourne</em></a><em> and is part of the international research team behind the World Online Whistleblowing Survey, </em><a href=\"https://whistleblowingsurvey.org/\" title=\"\"><em>which you can complete here</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The Trades Union Congress march on Saturday is being held under the slogan \"A Future that Works\" as part of a campaign to force the government to consider alternatives to austerity measures. Here are some ideas from across the political spectrum.</p> <h2>1. Activist industrial policy</h2> <p>A version of picking winners, where the government backs certain sectors with significant funding support, whether direct grants or through an infrastructure bank. One clear example, already backed by successive governments, is aerospace. It could joined by, for instance, electric cars and tidal power.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Vince Cable, and Lord Adonis all favour a more dynamic industrial landscape.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> high, if the government of the day can find the money and policies to back the underlying requirements. In the words of Lord Adonis, the following need prolonged backing: skills, technology, innovation, government procurement, infrastructure, finance, and supply chains. Picking winners is not as simple as it sounds.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> Yes, but this is a long-term strategy that requires political consensus, from changes to education policy to supporting industries that have long lead-times (civil aircraft programmes work on 30-40 year cycles, for instance).</p> <h2>2. Specialist banks</h2> <p>Create a state bank or a series of specialist banks, targeted at specific sectors. This could be a national infrastructure bank (for roads), a national green bank (for tidal power), regional banks (akin to the German Landesbank system) or a small to medium-sized business bank. This is a long and impractical wish list \u2013 setting up one bank is difficult enough \u2013 but Vince Cable, the business secretary, has already announced plans for a \"business bank\" that could leverage up to \u00a310bn.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> TUC, Cable, the Labour party.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> high, but funding is the issue.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> It would need strict lending parameters, to prevent the Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac-style sprees that stoked the US housing boom.</p> <h2>3. Corporate governance overhaul</h2> <p>This would see more employees represented on management boards and remuneration committees in a way similar to the German stakeholder system. Lord Glasman, the Labour life peer, says it will harness the energy, skills and commitment of a workforce. \"A third of the board should be reserved for capital, a third for the workforce and a third for users and local interests. This would enable the negotiation of a corporate strategy in which the good of the firm is owned by each of its principle stakeholders. Accountability is too important to be left to accountants. That is a fundamental lesson of the crash.\"</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Germany, Glasman.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> low, because it is unlikely that the City, shareholders or companies would comply without legislation.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> Representatives would have to be put on Plc boards, not management boards, or companies would find a way around them.</p> <h2>4. Cut middle-class benefits to fund infrastructure spending</h2> <p>The Social Market Foundation (SMF), a thinktank, argues that benefits for the comparatively better-off should be cut and reinvested in infrastructure. Around \u00a315bn could be raised by cutting free bus passes and television licences for some better-off pensioners, as well as halving higher-rate pension tax relief and axing child benefits for the top 50% of earners.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> SMF. Ian Mulheirn, director of the SMF, says: \"We are screaming out for infrastructure investment, but if we are worried about funding it with extra borrowing, then the answer is to cut middle-class benefits that do nothing for growth.\"</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> medium. The Conservatives will not want to cut pension tax relief for a core segment of their voters. Labour and the Liberal Democrats would be more sympathetic.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> It would be a significant public spending cut and the funds could be leveraged, so it would definitely get projects started, although the boost would be medium- to long-term.</p> <h2>5. 'Guerilla economic development'</h2> <p>An idea floated by Karel Williams and Sukhdev Johal from the CRESCCresc research centre at the University of Manchester. Under one example, local council pension funds would be used to build social housing. These houses would be built on terrain such as land banks compulsorily purchased from housing developers and retailers such as Tesco. Similarly, public assets could be put in public trust for use by the local community. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, is trying to buy Dover Port on behalf of the local population.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Karel Williams and Sukhdev Johal, Charlie Elphicke</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> taking land off Tesco is illegal, but compulsory purchasing orders offer a way around that. The Port of Dover faces fewer legal impediments.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> Again, success would be long-term but it would effectively devolve economic power to local councils and regions.</p> <h2>6. Adopt the full Beecroft report</h2> <p>The report into employment law by Adrian Beecroft, a venture capitalist, is viewed as something of a rightwing nuclear option. Elements of the report have been decried by Cable as \"complete nonsense\", led by proposals to make it easier for firms to sack underperforming staff. Nonetheless, George Osborne's suggestion that workers give up employment rights in exchange for shares is seen as a follow-up to the report.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Adrian Beecroft</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> unlikely because of the likely reaction of centrist voters and Liberal Democrats.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> The effect would be immediate but it could be unexpected \u2013 strikes, for instance.</p> <h2>\u2022 Change the Bank of England inflation target to a nominal GDP growth target</h2> <p>Instead of focusing on a 2% inflation target, the monetary policy committee \u2013 which sets interest rates \u2013 could go for economic growth instead.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> the US economist Scott Sumner.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> the BoE would have to be convinced that it would not lead to spiralling inflation.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> If it resulted in GDP rising, the BoE would have to be vigilant to ensure that inflation did not wipe out the benefits.</p> <h2>8. The Alistair Darling plan</h2> <p>The plan of halving the economic deficit over four years \u2013 Labour's 2010 general election policy \u2013 would have led to less stringent spending cuts than those envisaged under the coalition. George Osborne has targeted eliminating the deficit by 2015.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Darling.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> nil, given the election result.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> If that plan had been put to the electorate now, the general election result might have been different. It would have taken less demand out of the economy too.</p> <h2>9. Relax immigration restrictions</h2> <p>Jonathan Portes at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) argues that the government should lower barriers to skilled immigrants from outside the European Union. He also argues that restrictions on non-EU students, and rules on their ability to secure jobs in the UK, should be relaxed.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> NIESR.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> unlikely under a government with Conservative leanings.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> NIESR's ideas certainly get a sympathetic hearing from sections of the business community, which are crying out for skilled labour.</p> <h2>10. Tax increases</h2> <p>\u2022 The TUC is calling for a number of tax changes to raise income and reduce the impact of the recession on the less well-off. It wants to equalise the rates for income tax and capital gains tax, to restore the top rate of tax to 50p, introduce a \"Robin Hood\" tax on financial transactions and abolish the domicile rule that allows people to avoid UK tax.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> TUC.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Osborne is not expected to reverse the reduction of the top tax rate from 45p to 50p.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> The Robin Hood tax, in particular, needs an international consensus that would be difficult to achieve. A 50p reversal would appeal to voters.</p>",
  "<p>Google is in a showdown with the French government over proposals to make search engines pay a charge for each link to French newspaper content.</p> <p>Google is threatening to exclude French media sites from its search results if Paris goes ahead with the plan for such sites to receive a commission fee each time they are referenced.</p> <p>It is the latest in a series of confrontations between the US company and European governments. This year German politicians examined draft legislation for a similar scheme of commission fees for newspapers sites. Editors claim the search engine is benefiting from advertising opportunities that are being lost to their sites.</p> <p>Last month a group of leading French newspaper publishers called on the government to adopt a law that would force search engines to pay copyright fees for links in their results. For example, if a Google search about the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, returned a list of articles by the newspapers Le Figaro or Les Echos, Google would have to pay a commission fee for displaying those links.</p> <p>Google executives met government representatives in Paris on Friday. In a letter to ministers obtained by Agence France Presse, Google said such a law would \"threaten its very existence\", and it would be forced to stop referencing any French media at all.</p> <p>The letter, later published on Google's <a href=\"http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.fr/2012/10/the-facts-about-our-position-on-french.html\" title=\"\">Europe blog</a>, said the search engine redirected 4bn clicks a month to French media sites. It said making search engines pay for directing people to news websites was like \"asking a taxi driver to pay for taking a customer to a restaurant\". It said the proposed law would limit people's access to information.</p> <p>Aurelie Filippetti, the French culture minister, who is in favour of measures to help the struggling French media, questioned the tone of Google's letter. \"You don't deal with a democratically elected government with threats,\" she told Agence France Presse.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/laurent-joffrin/20121018.OBS6291/le-chantage-de-google.html\" title=\"\">editorial</a>, Laurent Joffrin, editor of the news weekly Le Nouvel Observateur, accused Google of \"straightforward blackmail\" of the government and likened the company to a modern-day feudal lord.</p>",
  "<p>It was a desperate time for Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher. His prime suspect for the kidnapping of Sian O'Callaghan, who had been missing for five days, had been arrested but was refusing to talk.</p> <p>Rather than give in and order for Chris Halliwell to be taken to police station, Fulcher instructed him to be driven to an isolated hilltop. He was working on the premise that O'Callaghan could still be alive and wanted one last chance to look Halliwell in the eye and demand to know where she was.</p> <p>Ignoring the rules governing how suspects should be treated \u2013 there was no solicitor present and Fulcher did not read the prisoner his rights \u2013 the detective persuaded Halliwell to lead him to the missing woman's body.</p> <p>Dramatic enough, but what happened next was even more extraordinary. Out of the blue, Halliwell then took Fulcher to a field where the remains of a second woman had been buried years before.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R29zTZKHT1w?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R29zTZKHT1w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The saga of the arrest, the unconventional interview and the discovery of the two bodies can be told for the first time after Swindon taxi driver pleaded guilty to O'Callaghan's murder.</p> <p>It can also be finally revealed now that even though Halliwell led police to the second body, that of Becky Godden-Edwards, and told Fulcher he had killed her, he is not facing trial in relation to her death because a judge ruled that all the evidence gleaned during the four hours murderer and detective spent together was inadmissible in court.One family \u2014 Sian O'Callaghan's has at least had the satisfaction of seeing Halliwell convicted and jailed over the murder of their loved one. As far as Godden-Edwards's family is concerned, the fight for justice for her is only just starting.</p> <p>O'Callaghan, a 22-year-old office administrator, vanished in the early hours of Saturday 19 March last year moments after leaving a nightclub in the Wiltshire town. Her disappearance, just three months after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/28/joanna-yeates-murder-vincent-tabak?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">murder of the Bristol landscape architect Joanna Yeates</a>, became a huge story, with thousands of people joining the search</p> <p>.</p> <p>What happened next was outlined in days of pretrial legal argument at Bristol crown court, which gave a rare insight into the workings of the police in a fast-moving inquiry and the intense dilemmas that officers sometimes face.</p> <p>By Tuesday 22 March, the police investigation was focused on Halliwell, a father-of-three with a conviction for burglary but no known history of violence. He was living an apparently respectable life with a new partner, having separated from his wife.</p> <p>CCTV footage seemed to show O'Callaghan getting into his taxi. Operating on the premise that she could still be alive, Fulcher ordered Halliwell to be watched 24 hours a day; 12 surveillance vehicles tracked his every move. Fulcher let Halliwell \"run\", hoping he would lead police to the missing woman.</p> <p>\"My fear was, she could be dead; I hoped she was alive,\" Fulcher explained during the pretrial argument. \"My duty was clear: to work to find and protect Sian if I could. It's what any parent would have wanted a police officer to do for Sian.\"</p> <p>Fulcher decided to pressure Halliwell. On Wednesday 23 March, he was interviewed by detectives who told him they were talking to all the taxi drivers in Swindon. Fulcher then used the media to turn up the heat, releasing a cryptic press release saying he was \"very close to identifying Sian's whereabouts\". He was hoping Halliwell would return to O'Callaghan.</p> <p>Halliwell was watched as he picked up a poster appealing for information about O'Callaghan and put it in his car's rear window. More significantly, he was seen dumping a car seat cover and headrest in an industrial bin.</p> <p>By Thursday 24 March, Halliwell was watched buying an \"overdose quantity\" of pills, so Fulcher ordered him to be arrested. Two detectives carried out an \"urgent\" interview in a police car without a solicitor being present, which is permitted when it is thought any delay could lead to a victim's death. They asked him where O'Callaghan was, but Halliwell refused to co-operate and demanded to see a lawyer.</p> <p>The news was relayed to Fulcher, who ordered his officers to take Halliwell not to the police station but to Barbury Castle, an iron age fort on the outskirts of Swindon, where he would meet the suspect.</p> <p>Fulcher explained in court he had still been working on the basis that O'Callaghan could be alive and had wanted a one-to-one chat with Halliwell. The detective said he had wanted to \"look him in the eye\" and ask Halliwell to take him to O'Callaghan. He accepted he had put to one side the strictures of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace), which spells out how suspects should be treated, including the need to tell them they have the right to remain silent.</p> <p>Fulcher explained: \"On the one hand, I was cognisant of Mr Halliwell's rights. But my primary duty was to save Sian's life. My view was, there was an equation to balance between Mr Halliwell's right to silence and Sian O'Callaghan's right to life. My view was that Sian's right to life took a prior claim.\"</p> <p>So, without cautioning him, Fulcher asked Halliwell to do the \"right thing\". He told him he would be \"vilified\" if he did not help. Halliwell told Fulcher: \"You think I did it.\" Fulcher replied: \"I know you did it.\"</p> <p>After a few minutes, Halliwell gave in and said: \"Have you got a car? We'll go.\"</p> <p>Fulcher said it had been a \"rare moment in life\" as they drove to a spot near the Uffington white horse, in Oxfordshire, where O'Callaghan's body was later found down a steep bank. She had been stabbed in the head, strangled, beaten and sexually assaulted.</p> <p>The detective was about to order that Halliwell be taken to a police station when the suspect said: \"You and me need to have a chat.\" The pair sat down, smoked, and Halliwell asked: \"Do you want another one?\" Again, under the law, Fulcher should have cautioned Halliwell. But Fulcher said they had achieved a \"rapport\", and reading Halliwell his rights might have made him stop speaking.</p> <p>They got back into the car and Halliwell gave directions. Fulcher said during the legal argument that Halliwell said he had murdered a girl in about 2004. He had not known her, but had taken her from Swindon.</p> <p>The pair ended up in a 40-acre field in Gloucestershire. Halliwell paced out the spot where he said he had buried the body, the pretrial legal argument hearing was told. A body identified as that of Becky Godden-Edwards was later found. She had left home about nine years before. Her head has not been recovered and detectives cannot say how she died nor if she was sexually assaulted.</p> <p>Godden-Edwards had fallen out with her family. Her parents thought she had gone to Bristol or London and had no idea she had come to harm. They found out about her death on what would have been her 29th birthday.</p> <p>Halliwell was taken to a police station and Fulcher announced to the media that a 47-year-old man had been arrested for kidnap and two murders. \"The location of two bodies has been identified to me by this individual,\" Fulcher said. What Fulcher had not anticipated was that Halliwellclammed up once he had access to a lawyer.</p> <p>Fulcher told the preliminary hearing it seemed \"utterly ridiculous\" that a person who had taken him to two bodies could find some \"loophole that would get him away from the fact that he is a multiple murderer\".</p> <p>Halliwell's barrister, Richard Latham QC, insisted the Pace rules were a \"fundamental right\", suggesting Fulcher had \"gone back to the 70s\" style of policing.</p> <p>Mrs Justice Cox, who heard the legal arguments, agreed the details gleaned in the interview could not be admitted as evidence in court.</p> <p>It meant Halliwell cannot face trial over Godden-Edwards' death because there is no other evidence apart from what happened between the suspect and detective. The police did have other evidence linking Halliwell to O'Callaghan's murder, including forensics (for example, the car seat covers he was seen dumping contained traces of O'Callaghan's blood) and CCTV footage.</p> <p>Detectives established that on the night O'Callaghan vanished, Halliwell had been working in Swindon. He turned off his taxi digital handset at 2.13am but did not go home. Instead he made what police have described as a \"number of slow passes\" through Swindon Old Town, \"looking for a victim\".</p> <p>A CCTV camera caught him pulling alongside O'Callaghan at 2.57am. The moment she is seized or gets into the car is obscured by the car's hazard warning lights. But police believe Halliwell drove O'Callaghan to Savernake forest, 16 miles south of Swindon, where he killed her.</p> <p>Detectives think Halliwell later looked for another spot to hide the body and moved it on Monday 21 March.</p> <p>A trial was planned for next year until Halliwell decided to admit the crime.</p> <p>The victims' families are understood to be thankful for Fulcher's approach. O'Callaghan's family believe Fulcher was doing all he could to save her, in case she was still alive; Godden-Edwards's relatives now know the truth about their daughter's fate even if nobody has been punished for her murder.</p> <p>The chief constable of Wiltshire, Patrick Geenty, praised Fulcher during the pretrial hearing. \"There may be occasions where police officers have to make a decision in terms of saving life to step outside [the] rules,\" he said. \"I think the decision he made was a gutsy decision, a brave one. I would like to think I would make a similar decision in his circumstances.\"</p>",

  "<p>A Congolese rebel group accused of killings, mass rapes and other atrocities is taking groups of tourists on gorilla treks to the Virunga national park and using the proceeds to fund its insurgency.</p> <p>Government authorities were forced to withdraw from parts of the park earlier this year because of the advance by M23 rebels, and now tourists wanting to see the rare mountain gorillas are being led by rangers who have defected to the militia.</p> <p>A tour operator based in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/congo-rebels-capture-key-towns-conflict\" title=\"\">Bunagana, a border town that has been held by the M23</a> since early July, said international tourists were still coming to the park, at a cost of more than $350 (\u00a3218) a day.</p> <p>\"We had 39 visitors in August alone,\" said Laurent Ntawukiruwe, director of Shoushou Safari Tours. \"I have agents in many different countries that help to bring tourists in. We have had German and Italian visitors, and soon we will have some French coming.\" A group of British tourists were booked to visit on 29 October, but cancelled their reservation.</p> <p>Ntawukiruwe said his tours were run by rangers who had defected to M23, which is fighting an insurgency against the Democratic Republic of the Congo government. \"The four rangers \u2026 are now in collaboration with M23,\" he said.</p> <p>In September, a <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/11/dr-congo-m23-rebels-committing-war-crimes\" title=\"\">report by Human Rights Watch</a> accused the M23 fighters of committing \"widespread war crimes, including summary executions, rapes, and forced recruitment\". The UN has accused neighbouring Rwanda of supporting the rebels, prompting a number of countries to freeze aid to President Paul Kagame's government.</p> <p>The outbreak of hostilities between M23 and the Congolese army in May forced the Congolese National Park Authorities (the ICCN) to shut down its tourism activity. Shoushou Safari Tours has an ICCN sign on display at its Bunagana office, but the operation has no link to the legitimate park authorities, said Virunga park director Emmanuel de Merode.</p> <p>\"These tours have absolutely nothing to do with us,\" said De Merode. \"This puts the gorillas and the visitors at risk. You need to have well-trained staff to lead these tours \u2013 handling mountain gorillas is an extremely sensitive issue. These expeditions are detrimental to the park and we condemn them in the strongest terms.\"</p> <p>Vianney Harakandi in the Virunga park tourism office in Goma confirmed that a handful of rangers had defected to join M23. He criticised Shoushou Safari Tours for trying to suggest the expeditions were official, saying it was an attempt to disguise the fact that the tours were aiding M23. \"Ultimately the money the tourists pay will just reinforce the capacity of this illegal armed group,\" he said.</p> <p>Eugene Rwabuhihi, from the M23 department of tourism, environment and conservation, suggested the rebels were planning to step up the operation. \"We are preparing for tourism activities and securing the gorilla population,\" he said. \"When tourists come, they will pay to see the gorillas and we will receive part of that money for providing their security.\"</p> <p>Tourists pay $300 for the permit to see the gorillas, $50 for transportation and $10 for the guides. It is unclear how much of this goes to the rebel group. But it is significantly cheaper than visits to see mountain gorillas in Uganda and Rwanda, where permits alone cost $500 and $750 respectively.</p> <p>Tourists wanting to see the gorillas usually fly to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, before driving to the Congolese border and crossing into Bunagana, where they stay in the Mountain Gorilla hotel. The hotel has recently hosted meetings of high-ranking M23 military commanders.</p> <p>Because the border crossing is controlled by M23, the tourists no longer have to obtain a Congolese visa. \"It is much simpler for me like this, because I don't have to pay for my visa, or organise all sorts of different permits and passes,\" said Abdel, a French tourist who has booked with Shoushou and did not want to reveal his surname. \"I am fascinated by the Congo, but I've never been. I'm going into a war zone and there is a lot that I don't know. I'm going there to learn, to get that knowledge.\"</p> <p>Abdel, who lives in Kampala, said he was not concerned that the tours were being conducted by, and make profits for, an armed rebel group. \"I want to be able to see the gorillas without lots of other tourists around, but this is also an experience that will allow me to see many things I've never seen before.</p> <p>\"I am keeping an open mind. The situation there is complicated; it's not as simple as saying 'the rebels are bad, the government is good'.</p> <p>\"My father fought in the Algerian resistance against France, and back then they called him a terrorist. But he was a freedom fighter.\"</p> <h2>National park plagued by death</h2> <p>Virunga is the oldest and most bio-diverse national park in Africa, but it has been ravaged by the cyclical violence that has plagued eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo over the last 25 years.</p> <p>The fall of Mobutu Sese Seko in the 1980s brought violence and poachers. Animal populations, especially of large mammals, were severely affected. The Rwandan genocide and subsequent Congo wars brought further instability, with the rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda establishing itself in the centre of the park.</p> <p>This instability culminated in the Kivu conflict of 2004 to 2009, where Laurent Nkunda's National Congress for the Defence of the People rebels built their strongholds in and around Virunga.</p> <p>His fighters finally signed a peace agreement in March 2009 and integrated into the Congolese army, allowing the Congolese National Park Authorities to oversee the recovery of Virunga's plants and wildlife, especially the rare mountain gorillas. Tourists had begun to return in increasing numbers; in 2009 the park received 550 visitors, by 2010 that figure rose to 3,000, and was projected to reach 6,000 this year.</p> <p>But in April those former fighters mutinied again, forming M23. The M23 commanders have taken key towns in and around the park, and for now it is largely under M23 control.</p> <p>Park authorities have been forced to suspend tourism again, and rangers risk their lives as they seek to ensure the security of the local Congolese people and Virunga's mountain gorillas. More than 130 rangers have been killed since 1996, including one in May.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have announced a tightening of rules to prevent tuberculosis spreading between cattle, as the controversial badger cull aimed at curbing bovine TB <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn\" title=\"\">struggles to get started</a>.</p> <p>The strengthened rules, which will come into force from 1 January 2013, include changes to the testing regime and cattle movement restrictions.</p> <p>\"We need to stop the spread of bovine TB, which led to the slaughter of 26,000 cattle in 2011 alone,\" said Liberal Democrat agriculture minister David Heath. \"These strengthened measures, alongside our badger control policy and the ongoing development of vaccines, are about reducing risks from all possible sources of TB infection, to help control the disease and eventually eradicate it.\"</p> <p>The new measures include an extension of the region where farms must be tested yearly for TB: 10 new counties will be included across south-west, west and central England. The new rules on cattle movement mean that, in all cases, farmers who have had a case of TB in their farm will not be allowed to bring new cattle in until the rest of the herd has been tested for TB and a vet has carried out an assessment. In addition, farmers now have 30 days, down from 60 days, to move cattle that test negative for TB out of a TB breakdown farm.</p> <p>Veterinarian Mark Jones, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/world/united_kingdom/work/badgers/tips/badgers_action_toolkit.html\" title=\"\">Humane Society International</a>, which is campaigning against the badger cull, said: \"We welcome the changes, many of which are common sense in terms of disease control, but they should have been introduced long ago.</p> <p>\"The changes reflect the fact that there are many inadequacies in the current TB control measures, which should be addressed and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/05/badger-cull-tb-cattle\" title=\"\">their impact assessed</a> before any culling of badgers is considered. Defra appears to have finally recognised some of the serious flaws that exist within the current system.\"</p> <p>The new rules \"move a little way in the right direction\", according to Prof John Bourne, who led a landmark 10-year badger culling trial and also with many other scientists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">opposes the government's proposed cull</a>. Bourne said only even stricter biosecurity would control bovine TB, as it had 50 years ago in the UK.</p> <p>It was recently revealed that a European Commission inspection conducted in September 2011 found a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">catalogue of failures in English farmers' biosecurity</a>. These included missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection at farm, vehicle, market and slaughterhouse levels, exacerbated by lack of adequate supervision\". All these problems increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle.</p> <p>Heath said: \"We already have strong measures in place to tackle transmission between cattle. However, we are always looking to improve our methods and will strengthen controls where necessary.\"</p> <p>Bourne said new measures still fail to recognise the problem that the test frequently gives false negatives, ie passes infected cows as healthy. When they are moved, they carry infection to new farms. Bourne said this could be overcome, as in the 1950s and 1960s, by banning any movement between heavily tested TB-free herds and herds which had not been heavily tested. \"The attested herd scheme was successful in UK in the 50s and 60s and was the basis of eradication in Australia,\" he said. \"But farmers would not like it and this is why it is unlikely to happen.\"</p>",
  "<p>Although the Argentinian director and screenwriter Eduardo de Gregorio, who has died aged 70, had lived in Paris since&#xa0;1970, his&#xa0;work was always identifiably South American. This can be attributed to the overpowering influence of the labyrinthine stories of Jorge Luis Borges on a generation of&#xa0;South American artists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398298704\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350660947088/Eduardo-de-Gregorio-003.jpg\" alt=\"Eduardo de Gregorio\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eduardo de Gregorio</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>De Gregorio brought this Borgesian aura to bear on the five features he directed, and on the screenplays he wrote with Jacques Rivette and Bernardo Bertolucci. In fact, for the latter's The Spider's Stratagem (1970), De Gregorio adapted the Borges story Theme of the Traitor and the Hero, smoothly transposing it from Ireland to Italy. It was an elaborate piece of&#xa0;Oedipal plotting in which, revisiting the village in the Po valley where his father was murdered in 1936, a young man discovers that his father was not a&#xa0;hero, but a traitor.</p> <p>It was a theme taken up again in&#xa0;De&#xa0;Gregorio's second film as a&#xa0;director, Short Memory (La M\u00e9moire Courte, 1979), a Jamesian political thriller which harks back to the time when Nazis took refuge in South America after the second world war. It&#xa0;was inevitable that De Gregorio's films often made reference to the writings of Henry James, whose short stories Borges much admired. De Gregorio's screenplay for Rivette's C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating (C\u00e9line et Julie Vont en Bateau, 1974) was suggested by&#xa0;two James stories, but his most direct homage was Aspern (1985). The&#xa0;James novella The Aspern Papers was relocated from 19th-century Venice to&#xa0;present-day Lisbon, mainly because the film, which&#xa0;De Gregorio directed, was made with Portuguese money and&#xa0;was cheaper to&#xa0;shoot there.</p> <p>Money, or the lack of it, was a&#xa0;dominant feature in the conversations of South American exiles in Paris in&#xa0;the early 70s. Argentinean directors, among them De Gregorio, Edgardo Cozarinsky and Hugo Santiago, as well as the Chilean <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/aug/19/raul-ruiz-obituary\" title=\"\">Ra\u00fal Ruiz</a>, battled to get financing for their films. I recall the days when De Gregorio, and our mutual friend, the future author <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/09/gilbert-adair\" title=\"\">Gilbert Adair</a>, would come round to my small flat on the \u00cele Saint-Louis to watch films on my television, as neither of them could afford to buy or rent one. We would also all meet frequently at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, where De Gregorio expressed his enthusiasm for the movies of Fritz Lang, another influence on his work. He&#xa0;was able to earn a living by lecturing at the Sorbonne and La F\u00e9mis, the leading film school in Paris, from 1986.</p> <p>De Gregorio was born in Buenos Aires, where he studied philosophy and literature. Immediately after the coup d'etat in 1966, he left for Europe, principally because of the stifling moral order imposed by the military dictatorship. In Italy he met Michael Graham, an American writer with whom he lived in a tempestuous relationship for many years, and with whom he would write his first feature, S\u00e9rail (Surreal Estate, 1976), and&#xa0;Aspern.</p> <p>While living in Rome, De Gregorio wrote his first script, The Visionaries (I Visionari, 1968). After making The&#xa0;Spider's Stratagem with Bertolucci, he settled in Paris, mainly because he&#xa0;wished to work with members of&#xa0;the&#xa0;French New Wave. This dream was realised when he started filming with Rivette on C\u00e9line and Julie Go&#xa0;Boating.</p> <p>A brilliantly allusive comic meditation on the nature of fantasy, the film manages to take in Lewis Carroll, Jean Cocteau, Borges, Kafka, Proust, cartoons and Hollywood movies of the 1950s along the way. It concerns two young women, a magician (Juliet Berto) and a librarian (Dominique Labourier) who get involved in an endless theatrical melodrama being played out by two women (Bulle Ogier, Marie-France Pisier) in an old suburban house. According to Rivette, \"There never really was a written script. I like having someone by my side, anyway, as a kind of referee, not an arbitrator but someone who has other ideas. So Eduardo was there almost from the start. But I didn't ask him to come as a scriptwriter. I asked him just to come and talk with us on the same level, and he was present during all the shooting.\"</p> <p>In 1976, Rivette and De Gregorio made Duelle, a film noir, and Noro\u00eet, a pirate adventure, back to back. These were part of an ambitious four-part project with a&#xa0;running sub-plot involving a&#xa0;mythical war between goddesses of&#xa0;the sun (Ogier) and the moon (Berto), fighting for possession of a mysterious jewel. When the project fell through, De Gregorio decided to direct a feature film himself. S\u00e9rail had Ogier and Pisier as occupants of a large spooky house into which a&#xa0;novelist (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/apr/06/corin-redgrave-obituary\" title=\"\">Corin Redgrave</a>) stumbles. In a way, the elliptical style raised the question of&#xa0;how much De&#xa0;Gregorio owed to Rivette or vice versa.</p> <p>De Gregorio's last collaboration with Rivette, Merry-Go-Round (1981), was dogged by troubles, and it showed. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/feb/03/maria-schneider-obituary\" title=\"\">Maria Schneider</a>, the female lead, quit&#xa0;the film before the end of shooting; the actor Joe Dallesandro was taking large amounts of drugs; and Rivette was teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>Meanwhile, De Gregorio managed to&#xa0;direct Aspern and Corps Perdus (Lost Bodies, 1989), the latter marking a brief return to his birthplace. Shot in Buenos Aires, it followed an art restorer into an old, dark house (a favourite locus of the director) where he is to restore a weird painting but is drawn into a mysterious and dangerous past. According to the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, the film was an interesting way of representing Buenos Aires in absentia, \"dialectically shutting out most evidence of the city while actually filming there\".</p> <p>De Gregorio's last film was Stolen Tangos (Tangos Vol\u00e9s, 2002), set in Buenos Aires at the end of the 1930s but shot in studios in France and Spain.

  "<h2>PREMIER LEAGUE MEDALS: NONE. THANKS: NONE</h2> <p>Poor old $tevie Mbe! There he goes, tirelessly running up and down the pitch, as he's done for the past 14 lung-busting years, demanding the ball, powering through midfield, sending 45-yard blooters over the heads of infinitely better-placed colleagues, and on the rare occasion one whistles past a surprised keeper's lugs and finds its way into the net instead of the top corner of the stand, bombing off towards the touchline, pushing aside and shrugging off any team-mates desirous of celebrating Liverpool's goal in order to ostentatiously point at the name emblazoned on the back of his shirt. All that effort, and for what? To stand accused of being a crass egotist, that's for what!</p> <p>\"I respect [$tevie Mbe] as a footballer, but there is nobody more egotistical than him,\" announced El-Hadji Diouf today, in an interview with le rag fran\u00e7aise L'Equipe. Now, we're assuming this particular parlez was conducted with one of Diouf's eyebrows twanging up and down like the tremolo arm on Duane Eddy's guitar*, because in a robust 165-word rant, the former Liverpool waste of space used the words \"I\" or \"me\" 19 times, meaning that 11.5% of the hot air coming out of his mouth was directly self-referencing. \"I leave my mark wherever I go,\" he boasted, presumably in reference to one of his spitting controversies or perhaps that time he was photographed stepping out of a vehicle which made Chris Eubank's truck look like a Fiat 500 wearing what appeared to be a onesie made out of terry towelling, because the Fiver will be jiggered sky high if it can remember him doing anything else of note while at Liverpool, Bolton, Blackburn, Sunderland, Rangers or Doncaster.</p> <p>But anyway, when the striker, currently at Dirty Leeds, wasn't patting himself furiously on the back for having \"never been to prison\" or having \"never injured anyone on the pitch\" \u2013 well done, El-Hadji, well done! \u2013 he was getting stuck into his old captain at Anfield. \"He does not care about others. I spoke to the major figures at Liverpool and nobody can stand him. And I am not talking about Jamie Carragher. I was in Pele's 100 players of the century! Not him!\"</p> <p>Whether any of this is true or not, the Fiver has no idea. (Even Pele can't have been that bloody daft, for a start. Eh?) But the Fiver also doesn't care. Consider this: even if $tevie Mbe is as self-absorbed and unpopular as Diouf insists, does it make any difference to how his Liverpool team-mates interact with him on the pitch? No. You don't have to like everyone you work with, after all. Take the Fiver's relationship with The Man, for example. He's a terrible sod, who keeps thrashing us on the bare buttocks with his golf club for little or no reason.

  "<p>It was only a matter of time before somebody broke the fragile social and political consensus surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/geo-engineering\" title=\"\">geoengineering</a>, and had a first crack at \"experiment Earth\".</p> <p>The news that American businessman Russ George <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering\" title=\"\">has dumped 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean</a> in an attempt to fertilise algal blooms that absorb carbon dioxide, was received with justified indignation and outrage by campaigners and mainstream scientists. But there have been rumblings (and <a href=\"http://www.handsoffmotherearth.org/learn-more/what-is-geoengineering/ocean-fertilization/\" title=\"\">rumours of shadowy trials</a>) for many years, and the idea of being a \"geoengineer\" was always going to prove tempting for the likes of George (who is blacklisted at several international ports for previous algae-related <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering\" title=\"\">misdemeanours</a>).</p> <p>Geoengineering \u2013 the possibility of using large-scale technologies to counteract the effects of climate change \u2013 has arrived. The question is, are we ready for it?</p> <p>From a scientific perspective, the answer is \"not yet\". Very little is known about any of the technologies that we might one day use to seize control of the global thermostat. Some sound like science fiction and will probably remain that way. Even the more familiar ideas \u2013 like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-biochar\" title=\"\">using biochar to capture CO<sub>2</sub></a> \u2013 are unknown entities when operating on a global scale.</p> <p>But the big questions, for now, have less to do with science and more to do with politics, as the Canadian iron dump illustrates so well. The ingredients of a classic controversy are all there - a wealthy, gung-ho businessman; a misled and powerless local population; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/17/canada-geoengineering-pacific?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">an allegedly complicit government</a> and a blanket of secrecy over the whole affair. <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/publications/public-engagement-geoengineering-research-preliminary-report-spice-deliberative-worksho\" title=\"\">Research has shown</a> that these are the kinds of issues that people are concerned about. And with individuals like Russ George around, who can blame them?</p> <p>The prospect of geoengineering raises fundamental questions about whether we are capable of actively, co-operatively and equitably managing the global commons. This is new territory: whereas the risks of a nuclear disaster are potentially global, the risks of geoengineering are inherently so. Are we ready to govern technologies that if ever deployed, would need to be maintained for decades \u2013 or perhaps even centuries \u2013 in order to keep temperatures down and the climate stable? The history of the past century suggests that we are in no position to manage technologies on this scale, or even keep rogue researchers in check.</p> <p>In fairness, there are some <a href=\"http://www.srmgi.org/\" title=\"\">serious efforts underway to anticipate the governance challenges</a> that geoengineering will raise, and to <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">involve public and civil society voices</a> in debates about how \u2013 or <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/publications/public-engagement-geoengineering-research-preliminary-report-spice-deliberative-worksho\" title=\"\">even if</a> \u2013 geoengineering research should go ahead. But thanks to a characteristically weasel-worded UN text, there is precious little clarity about the level of geoengineering research permitted under international law, allowing George to describe two widely cited moratoria on ocean fertilisation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering\" title=\"\">as \"a mythology\"</a>.</p> <p>Campaign groups like <a href=\"http://www.etcgroup.org/issues/climate-geoengineering\" title=\"\">ETC</a> \u2013 that have persistently opposed geoengineering experiments of any kind \u2013 are dismissed as scaremongers by some in the scientific community. But rogue experiments like this vindicate their warnings \u2013 and may compromise the integrity of the whole field in the eyes of the public.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/10/scientists-respond-to-rogue-ocean-fertilisation-experiment\" title=\"\">vast majority of scientists</a> working on geoengineering are well aware of the ethical implications of their research, and <a href=\"http://thereluctantgeoengineer.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">are reluctant</a> to suggest that they have sensible answers to climate change. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/17/us-geoengineers-spray-sun-balloon\" title=\"\">a handful are more enthusiastic</a>, and outside of the scientific community, there are plenty of people itching to promote a climate \"fix\", because geoengineering offers a method of tackling climate change that doesn't require asking any difficult questions about unsustainable systems of production and consumption.</p> <p>In the US, rightwing pressure groups <a href=\"http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2007/12/01/geo-engineering-seen-practical-cost-effective-global-warming-strategy\" title=\"\">like the Heartland Institute</a> have thrown their weight behind geoengineering as a \"cost effective\" solution to climate change, which is an incredibly telling insight into supposed climate scepticism. So often, a rejection of the science of climate change is just a proxy for a dislike of the policy implications. For those who object to the social engineering of behaviour change or regulation, geoengineering is a preferable option.</p> <p>It is the politics of climate change \u2013 not the science of geoengineering \u2013 that led to the iron dumping . Although artificial algal blooms are likely to have a range of unanticipated side-effects, it is not difficult to see how carbon captured through ocean fertilisation could easily be transformed into lucrative credits and fed into global carbon markets.</p> <p>And this possibility \u2013 profitable colonic irrigation for the planet \u2013 is simply too tempting for a rogue geoengineer to resist.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Corner works in the <a href=\"http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/researchstaff/corner.html\" title=\"\">School of Psychology at Cardiff University</a> , for the <a href=\"http://talkingclimate.org/\" title=\"\">Climate Outreach Information Network</a>, and is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Integrated Assessment of Geoengineering Proposals</a> research team</p>",
  "<p>A judge took the unprecedented step this week of publicising <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/judge-missing-children-abducted-mother\" title=\"\">the apparent abduction of four children</a> involved in a custody battle between their Welsh mother and Spanish father. After being ordered to return her children to their father, Jennifer Jones allegedly absconded from her Carmarthenshire home with Jessica, 14, Tomas, 12, Eva, nine and David, eight. Airports and ports were put on standby. They were found 24 hours later, when the mother was arrested with her new partner and the children were placed in care before being taken back to Spain.</p> <p>The precise circumstances surrounding this case are not clear. However, in the past year, British consular assistance for help in child residence cases involving a partner from another country has been sought 17 to 29 times each month. There has been no rise in the total number of cases, but experts say there is one area where cases abroad are increasing, albeit one in which no statistics are collected and no records kept.</p> <p>John Mellor, service manager at <a href=\"http://www.cafcass.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service</a> (Cafcass), who specialises in cases of child abduction and international relocation, says he is seeing an increasing number of cases where a British couple split up after moving abroad with their British children.</p> <p>When one parent \u2013 usually the mother \u2013 wants to return to the UK with the children, Mellor says he or she finds out too late that the children are under a foreign jurisdiction and the British courts have no say over their future. \"This situation is becoming more common given global patterns of migration combined with the economic situation, which is leading to expat couples finding their jobs and businesses abroad collapsing,\" he says.</p> <p>Having a custody case heard in a foreign court, warns Mellor, can be highly detrimental to the mother's case. \"Unlike in the UK, where complex international custody cases are transferred to a higher court, in many foreign countries, a family court is usually quite a low-level judge in a little, local court which will never have dealt with one of these cases before and probably never will again.\"</p> <p>Decisions, he adds, tend to be made \"on a pretty hit-and-miss basis. There's little expertise, knowledge and understanding informing the decisions of those judges. Whichever parent puts the most compelling argument or plays to that judge's prejudicial assumptions will win. The judges often have default positions, like 'mothers who go away are not good mothers', or that 'a mother's place is in the home, no matter what'.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dawsoncornwell.com/en/about_amh.html\" title=\"\">Anne-Marie Hutchinson</a>, who won the international family lawyer of the year award and an OBE for her services to international child abduction, has dealt with at least six cases this year of British expat couples who found themselves fighting their custody battles in a foreign court.</p> <p>\"It happens in the UK too,\" she added. \"There are lots of eastern European women who came over to Britain with their families when the economy was strong. They want to go back home to their friends and families but their husbands won't let them take the children.\"</p> <p>It is the mothers, she says, who tend to come off worse when fighting for custody of their children in a foreign court. \"Women often can't get interim leave to bring their children home but also can't afford to stay abroad. Their former partners successfully spin them as having abandoned their children. But if they stay, they're penniless and thus have no prospect of persuading the court they can look after their own children.\"</p> <p>For the past two years, Mary has been battling with a Portuguese court for permission to bring her two young children back home with her to England.</p> <p><strong>Idyllic</strong></p> <p>Life was idyllic when Mary and Dan first moved to Portugal with their two young children. The British-born family bought land in an isolated part of the country and set about building their new home, living in a bus they had driven over from England and eating food they had grown themselves.</p> <p>The relationship unravelled in 2010, four years later. She wanted to come home but Dan refused and insisted the children, now seven and five, stay with him. To her surprise, Mary discovered the case had to be heard in a local, Portuguese court: by moving abroad, her children's country of habitual residence had shifted.</p> <p>\"International law makes it almost impossible for mothers to get a foreign court's permission to take their children back home,\" says Mary, who has asked for names to be changed for fear that talking to the media will harm her case. \"If I stay in the UK during those months, I could lose the court case by default because Dan will claim the children are, by then, happy in Portugal and settled without me,\" she says. \"But if I give up my life in England to go back out to Portugal, I will automatically lose my case because I will no longer have a house or a job back home to offer them.\"</p> <p>Mary is now studying full-time for a postgraduate certificate in education and has her own house in the north of England. She insists it is impossible for her to live in Portugal. \"I can't make a life there,\" she says. \"The farm is in the middle of nowhere. The closest two schools \u2013 the only places I could find work that would pay well enough to enable me to survive on my own \u2013 are a three-hour drive away, which means I would only be able to see the children one day a week. Added to which, jobs don't come up at either school very often so it's highly unlikely that I could even find enough work to be able to afford to stay in the country.</p> <p><strong>Isolated</strong></p> <p>\"I would have no savings, house or social benefit system to fall back on,\" she adds. \"I would be completely isolated: I don't speak Portuguese. I have few friends and no family out there.\"</p> <p>In contrast, says Mary, Dan could easily find employment in the British city where she now lives: the couple lived and worked there before moving together to Portugal. \"The children need their mummy,\" she says. \"It is not a choice between whether the children should live either with Mum or Dad, it's either 'Dad alone in Portugal' or 'Mum with family and optional dad in England'. Dan has the choice whether he lives in England. I cannot live in Portugal.\"</p> <p>Alison Shalaby is acting director of <a href=\"http://www.reunite.org/\" title=\"\">Reunite</a>, a UK charity dealing with the movement of children across international borders. She says her charity, part-funded by the Ministry of Justice and the Foreign Office, is handling an increasing number of similar cases from countries including Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. They have had 16 this year already. Another 19 women have rung for advice.</p> <p>\"It's not about nationality or passports: by moving to a foreign country with a settled purpose, you are changing your children's country of habitual residence,\" she said. \"That can happen after just a couple of months.</p> <p>\"If parents can't decide where their children should live, the best-placed country to make that decision for them is the country of their children's residence,\" she said. \"If you choose to live in another country, you have to abide by the laws of that country.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, Mary says it is only because her new partner has paid for her flights and accommodation in Portugal over the past year that she has not already lost her case. \"If I had not met my new partner, I would not have been able to afford to see my children in Portugal and build a life for them in the UK at the same time. Apart from the emotional impact on my children and myself, that would have been devastating for my case.</p> <p>\"The law is wrong. I hate to say it, but I can see this ending up with me losing my children,\" she admits. \"I can't bear to think what my life \u2013 or theirs \u2013 will be like then. It's beyond imagining.\"</p>",
  "<p>The rules of discussing class in Britain are, pleasingly, very like those of cricket. Once you know them, they seem incredibly obvious and intuitive and barely worth mentioning; if you don't know them, they are pointlessly, sadistically complicated, their exclusivity almost an exercise in snobbery in its own right. Nowhere is this more evident and yet more tacit than in relationships: people marry into their own class. It's called \"assortative mating\". You know this by looking around, yet there's such profound squeamishness about it that research tends to cluster around class proxies. The question goes: \"Do you and your spouse share the same educational attainment?\" (Translation: are you the same class?) Or: \"Did you go to the same university?\" (Translation: are you really, really the same class?)</p> <p>This trend is immune to social progress elsewhere. If anything, people are more likely than ever to marry into their own class, as a&#xa0;report from the Institute for Public Policy Research showed this year. Of people born in 1958, just over a third of women had a partner from the same class as themselves: 38% married up, while 23% married down. For those born in 1970, 45% married into the same class; of those born between 1976 and 1981, 56% married into the same class, with a far smaller proportion (16%) marrying up.</p> <p>Even the phrases \"marrying up\" and \"marrying down\" are sullying to use. You can't really escape the connotation that the rich are better than the poor. But I use them anyway, putting them in the grammatical equivalent of surgical gloves, because there is no right-on alternative: there's no unsnobbish way to convey a difference in class between two people. The leftwards path is to pretend class doesn't exist. Which is fine, but it's also total horse manure.</p> <p>So what's it actually like, when you don't mate assortatively? Emily Wyndham married her husband 11 years ago this week. They met at Oxford University. \"I'd describe my parents as working class made good,\" she says. \"My father had to leave school at 16 for financial reasons, but he became a businessman, they built a hotel. Not anywhere nice \u2013 it was in a crap industrial coastal town they forgot to close down. In doing so, they made quite a lot of money \u2013 enough to send us to private school \u2013 so we were the first generation of our family to go to university. He's always very keenly been aware of his position in life, and always very keenly felt he was working class, and wanted to assimilate himself to become middle class. He's very class-conscious. He reads the Telegraph; he's voted Tory for years and years.</p> <p>\"I didn't feel aware of class differences at university. Three of my closest friends had been to comps; we were all pretty much lower middle class, all from quite similar backgrounds.\"</p> <p>She met her future husband while she was having tea with a student from another college. \"I&#xa0;think she actually said, 'He's very posh.' \" They got together just after finals. \"It was never an issue; I just knew he was very nicely spoken, as my mother would say. I think quite early on in our relationship he went off shooting. It was like he'd moved to another world that I hadn't known existed. When we were in&#xa0;our final term, he went to his cousin's birthday and I said, 'That sounds very posh.' And he said rather sheepishly, 'Well, he is an earl.' And I thought, 'Oh fuck. This is way outside anything I've ever experienced.' \"</p> <p>She met his parents one month into the relationship. \"I think they were a bit underwhelmed. I smoked at the time. I'm so embarrassed to think of this now, but I think I&#xa0;smoked between courses and they were appalled. Generally, I got the impression that I was being looked up and down and found rather wanting. But, in my favour, his sister was going out with someone who was even more low-class than me. They wanted him to marry someone who had grown up around the corner, whose parents they knew and of whom they approved. They attached no value at all to academic prowess. They hadn't heard of my parents, so they weren't interested in&#xa0;me. And also, I think they just slightly thought that I was a little bit too loud \u2013 not the quietly understated, elegant person that would fit into their quietly understated, elegant lifestyle.\"</p> <p>When Emily introduced her parents to his \u2013 at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/oct/01/foodanddrink.restaurants\" title=\"\">the smart Islington restaurant Granita</a> \u2013 that went quite well. \"The worst was the wedding. My parents were sending out invitations, but they were on their uppers because their business had gone to pot. So they weren't paying, but because they're quite proud, I&#xa0;wanted them to feel like they were still the hosts. The invitations had to come from them. And there were all these titles, and they'd been told his aged aunt would only open invitations that were correctly addressed. My mum was very much, 'They'll just have to take us as they find us.' But my dad was going, 'No, no, no, it's got to be right.' He was shitting himself that somehow he would make some terrible faux pas and our lowly beginnings would be revealed.</p> <p>\"In his speech, he actually said, 'It's quite clear to all of us that Tom's married above himself.' It brought the house down \u2013 in the brilliant way of the British class system, where nobody ever says anything but everybody notices everything.\"</p> <p>Emily was 26 when she married. The wedding sounds very stressful: if you're a Catholic and not the Brideshead sort, apparently it's immediately obvious how ill bred you are to people who know about that sort of thing. I wonder why she didn't put it off a bit longer. \"My biological clock had been on speed-dial for a long time. I knew at 20 that I&#xa0;didn't want to be with someone I couldn't foresee a future with. And Tom was not that bothered about class \u2013 he couldn't have married anybody who was a class warrior, who thought everything he stood for was awful. He had to feel that he could be himself, and he did, and so did I.</p> <p>\"He said, 'Marrying you has taken me out of the&#xa0;upper class and put me into the middle class.' I know he was joking, but equally, there's an element of truth to it.\"</p> <p>And what about their four children, ranging in age from 18 months to 10? \"I'd say they are upper middle class, or possibly even middle-middle. In purely class terms, the decision about secondary school will be major. If they go to the state school, they will very obviously be different from their grandparents and even from their parents. I don't want them to grow up feeling completely divorced from their grandparents and their cousins. Although, of course, they're already divorced from my father's side.\"</p> <p>(Lady) Alice Douglas has been with Steve for six years. Previously, she was married to Simon, whom she met while he was serving nine years in prison for armed robbery. \"If I look at all my boyfriends, mostly they'd be working class. I don't know if that was a conscious decision, but certainly as a&#xa0;child I was always utterly devastated if anyone found out I had a title. It was just this terrible secret. Then, when I started going out with boys, I&#xa0;always preferred working-class boys. Now I&#xa0;live in a little Welsh village that is full of farmers and everyone's pretty working class, and my favourite thing is going to the pub at weekends and hanging out with all the farmers. I like people who work the land. I&#xa0;guess it's a sense of history, a sense of honesty. It's just life on a more basic level.\"</p> <p>Her first husband was a Turkish refugee, and that marriage failed because he couldn't stand living in England. \"My second husband I met when I was in a drama production at a prison. He was a&#xa0;typical working-class young lad who had masses of intelligence \u2013 he had such a lot to offer, but had failed to do anything beyond the army. I think that, because of his working-class roots, when he went up for jobs, he didn't really believe he should get them. Probably what class gives you is a belief that you can achieve things.\"</p> <p>They bonded over playing Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in the prison production, and married while he was still inside. He was five and a half years younger. \"We had a big, crazy wedding. Most people were cool about it, and I kind of ignored the ones that weren't. I don't know that there were that many differences. There were funny things \u2013 like if I was getting some building work and people were quoting, because I'd got a&#xa0;title and they didn't know me very well, it always seemed it was a bigger quote than if my ex-husband asked.</p> <p>\"Once, we were asked to go on Richard &amp; Judy. If Simon, my ex, ever tried to negotiate a fee for things like that, people were very dismissive and often rude to him \u2013 they'd quibble over 50 quid. Whereas if I asked, we might get \u00a31,000. It shows how ingrained it is, that if a person is of a higher class, they're worth more.\"</p> <p>The couple had two children, now 13 and 12, and split up over the classic things that split parents up, regardless of class: maturity, reliability, who's still in the pub and who isn't. \"The children are blessed with being comfortable in any class. They are just as happy with their grandma on Simon's side on a&#xa0;council estate as they are with my parents.\"</p> <p>Then she met Steve. \"I fell in love with him, and for about four years, he said, 'I love you, but I can't possibly get involved. Your life is too chaotic, it's too full on, there are too many people and I want a simple life.' It took four years to wear him down.\"</p> <p>Steve agrees with this analysis, pretty much: \"It's just so manic here. We're a clash of personalities really. Alice is definitely a go-getter and I'm more laid-back. I was brought up by very working-class parents. During the 1970s, growing up, there was work for everybody. My father, a maintenance fitter, always instilled in me not to be resentful of the upper classes, or the people bred into money, because they're the ones who create the work. Alice was born into wealth and power, but she'd never use it \u2013 she's absolutely down to earth. Although I do catch her up now and then on her accent. I've looked through every dictionary I can find, and I just can't find any R that would explain her pronunciation of bath.</p> <p>\"When I introduced her to my parents, they probably felt more concerned for Alice, really. They thought she could have been with somebody who could have given her a lot more \u2013 somebody far more independent and financially stable. But as soon as they met her and saw how sweet she was, that was it.\"</p> <p>Julia Stephenson met her boyfriend, Steve, seven years ago. \"I'm more middle class,\" she says, \"and he's working class. But I don't know if one can really describe one's own class. I've been pitched as more upper middle class just because of this flighty life I used to live. I didn't go to university, I&#xa0;left school and then went to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucie_Clayton_Charm_Academy\" title=\"\">Lucie Clayton's Secretarial College</a>. I was a Sloane Ranger, but I&#xa0;think a lot of people managed to be Sloane Rangers without necessarily being very wealthy.\"</p> <p>Her mother and father had had the same class gap, to which she attributes the marital problems that saw them divorce when she was seven. \"Her&#xa0;parents were very snotty and disapproving \u2013 they barely spoke to him \u2013 and they sent her off to&#xa0;Argentina for six months, but it didn't work. And then he went off and had affairs, because I&#xa0;think when men feel inadequate like that, they try to get validation from elsewhere.\"</p> <p>When Julia was young, she liked posh boys with&#xa0;snazzy cars, and got married in that mould at 26, but that didn't work out. \"I never would have met Steve if we weren't both Buddhists. But&#xa0;then we went on a Buddhist course to Japan and he really pursued me, which was heavenly. He was so confident. And that's when I realised that working-class men are where it's at. If only I'd realised that before my early 40s. As it was, I&#xa0;was pursuing these rather effete old Etonians. I&#xa0;like working-class men, anyway. I like the accent, I like the fact that they're always going to&#xa0;pubs and also, most importantly, how handy they are. They're always doing things round the house. He's built an extension. He's got four equally handy brothers and they all came round and helped him.</p> <p>\"My family were just delighted that I'd met anybody at all. My dad liked him, too. It's not like I was 21 and a young virgin needing protection. There are differences that are annoying. It annoys me that he likes all his food overcooked. He doesn't want to see any blood in meat. But, no, we don't have major differences. He left school when he was 15, but I left when I was 17, anyway. He has a very inquiring mind. And he's quite cultural. I thought one of the benefits of going out with a working-class man was that I wouldn't have to go to the theatre or to the opera or ballet, but no, he loves all that. I find it quite refreshing to be&#xa0;with someone who's not interested in keeping up with other people, who's happy to drive around in a bashed-up old van. Having been out with upper-class men, it would be a complete nightmare to be married to one of them. All the moaning, the sexual hang-ups, the way they need&#xa0;to be with men all the time, and are terrified of women\u2026\"</p> <p>As we talk, Steve arrives home, bearing the wherewithal to build something that will stop the dogs going downstairs in the middle of the night. \"He's getting the power drill out as we speak,\" Julia says, ironically delighted, but still actually quite delighted.</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed.</p> <h2><strong>When two families collide: one man's story</strong></h2> <p>You don't grasp the full extent to&#xa0;which your family communicates in middle-class code until you bring home a&#xa0;partner who does not. My new girlfriend, being not remotely middle class, didn't just lack fluency in this mysterious canon; she didn't even know it existed. The only upside was she had no idea just how badly things went when she first met my parents.</p> <p>I had a pretty good idea of how it would go, which is why I put it off for two years. I had left my wife to be with her, and my family was furious. How could you do this to your poor wife, they'd yell. What they really meant was, how could I do this to them? How could I swap an adorably gentle-mannered professional for a loud, semi-literate divorcee whose bookshelf held precisely four volumes, all true crime stories?</p> <p>The first few minutes didn't go too badly. She had recently enrolled on a college course and, as my family makes the traditional middle-class fetish of education, this seemed like safe conversational territory. And it was, until Mum asked, \"How will you cope with all the pressures of a full-time job and a&#xa0;college course on top of it?\"</p> <p>What this means is: \"Please note that I'm a very caring and sympathetic person.\" What my girlfriend heard was, \"Are you up to it?\" In her world, the only way to see off such doubt is to deliver a defensively bombastic broadside about how easy she finds everything. For her, that's how to demonstrate strength and resolve. In my family's world, you demonstrate that by volunteering ambivalence. \"Yes,\" you're meant to say, \"it's&#xa0;a lot to take on, and there are days when I do wonder how I'm going to manage it all.\" What that really says, of course, is, \"Please note that I'm a very thoughtful and considered person, whose modesty belies resilient self-belief.\" Boasting achieves the exact opposite of the desired effect. My parents exchanged troubled glances.</p> <p>Each time we met, they'd ask lots of questions, eliciting more boasts. In my girlfriend's circles, questions are not the currency of good manners, but the height of rudeness: intrusive, unwelcome, vaguely intimidating. None of her friends or family ever asked me anything about myself \u2013 apart from one night, when her brother, a bit drunk, asked about my job as an A&amp;E doctor. Then he clamped his hand over his mouth. \"Sorry \u2013 you must have thought I was going on like a copper!\" No, no, I reassured him, the thought had truthfully never crossed my mind.</p> <p>Announcing that my girlfriend was pregnant was probably the all-time low point. \"Well! What <em>interesting</em> children you'll have,\" was the best my sister could manage. We took my parents for a walk to break the news, but my girlfriend was nervous and blurted it out so clumsily that they thought she was joking. When the penny dropped, those fatal first four seconds of horrified shock, before a&#xa0;scramble to say the right thing, were so damning that we all pretended they'd never happened. Later on, my mum drew me to one side. \"Do&#xa0;you want to have a baby or a <em>family</em>?\" The implication was clear: we might be capable of breeding, but we were never going to create a family culture.</p> <p>To some degree she was right. My girlfriend likes to dress our daughter in Disney-branded outfits, comfort her with a&#xa0;dummy and feed her sweets as snacks, all of which I surreptitiously remove from our luggage before a visit to my&#xa0;family.</p> <p>Much of my family's disapproval is so coded that it goes over her head, but I clock every shudder and wince. Most of all, I clock the discrepancy between my family's self-image as radical, liberal, a bit bohemian, and its alarm at having to put into practice the inclusive values it so loves to extol over a glass of good wine. <strong>Anonymous</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II)</strong></p> <p>Ever since the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Obama officials, including the President himself, have been vowing that the perpetrators will be \"brought to justice\". That, of course, is typical American-speak for: \"without any evidence presented or due process afforded, we will execute suspects by bombing them from the air, along with anyone who may have the misfortune of being in close proximity to them.\" </p> <p>The Associated Press <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_US_NORTH_AFRICA_TERROR?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\">this week reported</a> on the Obama administration's current plans for Benghazi, plans that were \"provided by three current and one former administration official, as well as an analyst who was approached by the White House for help\". The report described how the US \"is readying strike forces and drones but first has to find a target\"; in other words, the gun is metaphorically cocked and simply in search of someone to shoot [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"U.S. investigators have only loosely linked 'one or two names' to the attack, and they lack proof that it was planned ahead of time or that the local fighters had any help from the larger al-Qaida affiliate, officials say.</p> <p>\"If that proof is found, the White House must decide whether to ask Libyan security forces to arrest the suspects with an eye to extraditing them to the U.S. for trial or to simply target the suspects with U.S. covert action.</p> <p>\"<em>U.S. officials say covert action is more likely</em>. The FBI couldn't gain access to the consulate until weeks after the attack, so it is unlikely it will be able to build a strong criminal case. The U.S. is also leery of trusting the arrest and questioning of the suspects to the fledgling Libyan security forces and legal system still building after the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.</p> <p>\"The burden of proof for U.S. covert action is far lower, but action by the CIA or special operations forces still requires a body of evidence that shows the suspect either took part in the violence or presents a 'continuing and persistent, imminent threat' to U.S. targets, current and former officials said.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is a pure expression of the modern incarnation of US justice: <em>it would be difficult to prove anyone's guilt if we had to provide due process, so we likely won't bother with that; instead, we'll just decide ourselves, in secret, who is guilty and then execute them at will</em>.</p> <p>This is precisely the mentality which the Obama administration used to justify the assassination of US citizen Anwar Awlaki in Yemen, and defenders of that due-process-free execution typically invoke exactly this same formulation. That's because US citizens have now largely and successfully been trained to view this type of \"justice\" as normal. </p> <p>\"Due process\" is viewed as a quaint and obsolete relic of the pre-9/11 era. The US president simply kills whomever he wants - anywhere in the world, far away from a war zone or battlefield - without the slightest obligation to present evident of guilt, to afford the accused any opportunity to contest the accusations, or to have his execution-decrees reviewed by anyone or even known to the public. That is the normalized model of US justice, which is why these unveiled plans are hardly controversial and why Obama officials feel no compunction about announcing them: if anything, they're eager to boast of their hunger to mete out this due-process-free \"justice\".</p> <p>Just how dubious is this whole process is highlighted by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/world/africa/suspect-in-benghazi-attack-scoffs-at-us.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=2&amp;\">a New York Times profile this morning</a> of Ahmed Abu Khattala, whom, says the Times, \"witnesses and the authorities have called one of the ringleaders of the\" consulate attack. The Times conveys that unnamed \"witnesses have said they saw him directing other fighters that night\" and that \"Libyan officials have singled him out.\"</p> <p>Abu Khattala, however, maintains that he is not a member of al-Qaida and \"insisted that he had not been part of the aggression at the American compound.\" He acknowledges that he was present at the consulate that night but \"had arrived just as the gunfire was beginning to crackle and had sought to break up a traffic jam around the demonstration.\" He also claims \"that guards inside the compound - Libyan or American, he was not sure - had shot first at the demonstrators, provoking them,\" and that \"the attackers had found weapons, including explosives and guns mounted with silencers, inside the American compound.\" As the Times put it, his \"exact role remains unclear\".</p> <p>For nations adhering to the most basic precepts of justice, these are the types of conflicting claims which are routinely resolved in a judicial tribunal, with all the evidence subject to examination and the accused given a fair opportunity to contest the accusations. But that is not how the US government functions. Rather, it convenes in secret, unilaterally decrees guilt and then - to use the AP's euphemism - will \"simply target the suspects with U.S. covert action\": i.e., execute them without any due process.</p> <p>The Times, apparently intended as a counter-balance to Abu Khattala's denials, noted that \"he expressed a notable absence of remorse over the assault\", and then added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"And he said that the United States had its own foreign policy to blame for the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 'Why is the United States always trying to impose its ideology on everyone else?' he asked. 'Why is it always trying to use force to implement its agendas?'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Time and again, this is what one finds at the crux of these episodes. Professed animosity toward the US - and especially the belief that violence against the US is the result of its own decades-long aggression - is viewed as evidence of guilt, proof of one's status as a \"militant\", justification for imprisoning or killing (Obama placed Awlaki on his hit list when Awlaki's anti-US sermons began powerfully resonating among English-speaking Muslim youths; the still-unproven claim that the preacher had an \"operational role\" in terror plots was publicly made only long after Obama's assassination order was publicly revealed). The apparent premise of US policy in the region seems to be that the occupations, invasions, bombings and killings must continue until there is nobody left who harbors hatred of the US: as self-contradictory and self-destructive an approach as can be conceived.</p> <p>The claimed power of the president to kill whomever he wants, anywhere in the world far from any war zone or battlefield, without a whiff of due process, oversight or transparency should be vehemently opposed first and foremost because it is the supreme expression of tyrannical power. If one is willing to grant <em>that</em> power to the president, then it is hard to see what powers one would find objectionable.</p> <p>But on pragmatic grounds as well, it is difficult to imagine a more menacing policy: if the US president continues simply to execute anyone he decides should die with drones and bombs, then the only certain outcome is that there will be more and more people who view the US as a justifiable target for retaliation and vengeance. That the White House is<em> eager</em> to have it known that they are rejecting the option of arrest and due process in favor of secret assassination is a potent reflection of how degraded American political culture is regarding such matters, of how normalized the most extremist theories of power have become.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>At the <a href=\"http://translationexercises.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/khalid-sheik-mohammed-increased-privacy-and-national-security-the-guantanamo-bay-spectacle/\">farce currently taking place at Guantanamo</a> known as the \"military commission\" of the accused 9/11 defendants - a process designed exclusively (1) to ensure a guilty verdict and (2) to <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-human-rights/guantanamo-today-aclu-asks-judge-not-censor-torture-testimony\">suppress any public evidence of the detainees' torture</a> - alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-trial_n_1976430.html\">had this to say</a> in response to American horror over the attack:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"The alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks told the Guantanamo courtroom on Wednesday that the U.S. government had killed many more people in the name of national security than he is accused of killing. . . . </p> <p>\"'When the government feels sad for the death or the killing of 3,000 people who were killed on September 11, we also should feel sorry that the American government that was represented by (the chief prosecutor) and others have killed thousands of people, millions,' said Mohammed, who wore a military-style camouflage vest to the courtroom.</p> <p>\"He accused the United States of using an elastic definition of national security, comparable to the way dictators bend the law to justify their acts.</p> <p>\"'Many can kill people under the name of national security, and to torture people under the name of national security, and to detain children under the name of national security, underage children,' he said in Arabic through an English interpreter.</p> <p>\"'The president can take someone and throw him into the sea under the name of national security and so he can also legislate the assassinations under the name of national security for the American citizens,' he said in an apparent reference to the U.S. killing and burial at sea of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the U.S. use of drone strikes against U.S. citizens accused of conspiring with al Qaeda.</p> <p>\"He advised the court against 'getting affected by the crocodile tears' and said, 'Your blood is not made out of gold and ours is made out of water. We are all human beings.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is what <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/06/22/terrorism_22/\">virtually every Muslim accused of engaging in violence against the US says</a> whenever some US judge or official expresses bewilderment at how they could do such a thing: namely, why do you not express similar shock and outrage at the violence against civilians and other forms of repression continuously committed by your own government, and why are you not similarly affected by your government's killing and other abuse of innocent Muslims, including children? This highlights still another grave harm from conducting oneself in this manner: the inability to insist upon adherence to moral and ethical standards with any degree of credibility or consistency (at least outside of the US).</p> <p>On a different note, MSNBC prime-time host Lawrence O'Donnell was asked this week in an impromptu interview why he does not cover Obama's war on whistleblowers and related civil liberties abuses; his answer becomes rather thoughtful as it progresses and is worth listening to:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YcWjYMj4eN8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YcWjYMj4eN8?list=UUhwwoeOZ3EJPobW83dgQfAg&amp;hl=en_US\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>UPDATE II</h2> <p>Earlier this week, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/world/europe/britain-refuses-to-extradite-computer-hacker-sought-in-us.html\">British government announced</a> that it was refusing the US's request to extradite Gary McKinnon, whom the US government accuses of seriously jeopardizing national security by hacking the Pentagon's computer networks. The US justice department insists that this was \"the biggest military computer hack of all time\". The British cited the fact that he suffers from Asperger syndrome and clinical depression and claims there is a high risk of suicide if he is extradited. The US pronounced itself \"disappointed\" by the British decision.</p> <p>Given Britain's decision to harbor this accused felon, one the US insists seriously damaged American national security, would the US be entitled to send an armed drone over London to kill him? Those who defend such extrajudicial assassinations in Yemen, Pakistan, Libya and other predominantly Muslim countries do so by claiming that there is an American entitlement to drone-kill people when those governments are unable or unwilling to turn over those alleged to have harmed US national security. Given that this is the case for McKinnon, what ground is there for arguing that the US would be barred from killing McKinnon by drone (aside from the fact that the type of people at risk from a drone attack in London are different than the type of people typically at risk from US drone attacks)?</p>",
  "<p>Ireland's former richest man Sean Quinn has avoided prison for at least another fortnight after the high court in Dublin granted his legal team a 13-day adjournment.</p> <p>Quinn's son Sean Jnr was also released from prison on Friday after serving a three-month sentence for contempt of court \u2013 a charge that he, his father and his cousin Peter Darragh Quinn were all found guilty of earlier this summer.</p> <p>They were found guilty after it emerged the Quinns had moved assets worth millions of euros out of reach of the former Anglo Irish Bank. The bank alleges the Quinn family owe the now state-owned institution more than \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn).</p> <p>Sean Quinn Jnr walked hand in hand his wife, Karen Woods, from Dublin's Four Courts to an awaiting BMW car.</p> <p>His father's legal team from Belfast told the court Quinn Snr's life would be at risk if he went to jail. They told the court that the bankrupt businessman wants to co-operate with the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation and purge his contempt.</p> <p>They have secured a 13-day adjournment to get up to speed on the case despite IBRC's concerns about delay.</p> <p>The bank's lawyers contend Quinn has done nothing to obey orders aimed at reversing a scheme to strip him of his valuable assets.</p> <p>They say that new evidence shows the Quinns are still in control of these companies and any substantial delay could mean certain assets will be lost for ever. His defence team countered that he is a 66-year-old who has had two major heart operations with his liberty at risk.</p> <p>Peter Darragh Quinn is effectively hiding from the Republic's authorities by fleeing to Northern Ireland. There are no legal measures in place for extradition because the case is a civil matter rather than a criminal one.</p> <p>Sean Quinn Snr lost his fortune in the international property market during the Celtic tiger boom years borrowing hundreds of millions of euros from the Anglo Irish Bank. The global recession and the property crash led to the collapse of the bank which was then nationalised as part of a state rescue plan of the debt-ridden Irish banking system.</p> <p>The Quinn business empire, built on a cement-making operation and a highly successful insurance firm, became the victim of over-reach into the property market. The Quinns personify the demise of the Celtic tiger economy and its over-confidence in a property boom.</p> <p>His fate has divided public opinion in the Republic in Cavan and Fermanagh, where the Quinns created thousands of jobs. Up to 5,000 people turned up last weekend for a rally in support of the family in its battle with the IBRC and the courts in Dublin. But there is little sympathy for the Quinns away from the family base.</p>",

  "<p>There are certainly drawbacks to being dead, but let's not forget the benefits. Six feet under. Away from the hustle and bustle of the metropolis. Ahhh \u2026 peace at last. I'm almost looking forward to it. Sadly, in the early 1800s these perks were not available to everyone.</p> <p>As I enter the Museum of London's latest exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/London-Wall/Whats-on/Exhibitions-Displays/Doctors-Dissection-Resurrection-Men/\" title=\"\">Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men</a>, I'm reminded how the epitaph \"rest in peace\" could only be guaranteed for a select few. A gilded iron coffin, complete with spring-loaded locks, is displayed opposite a blood-stained surgical table. As the curator, <a href=\"http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Collections-Research/LAARC/Centre-for-Human-Bioarchaeology/Staff/\" title=\"\">Jelena Bekvalac</a>, explains \"this was the time of the resurrection men, the body snatchers\". Affluent members of society went to great lengths to ensure their bodies did not end up in the hands of a wannabe surgeon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398050302\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350656433854/1819th-century-dissecting-001.jpg\" alt=\"18/19th century dissecting table\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wooden dissecting table, 1750-1870.

Aspiring surgeons tended to train in the more prestigious hospitals abroad, particularly in Paris. \"That's what really pushed and drove London - it was supply and demand,\" says Bejvalac. Unfortunately, this competition extended to the provision of fresh bodies on which trainee surgeons could practise. As I walk past Greenwood's <a href=\"http://users.bathspa.ac.uk/greenwood/imagemap.html\" title=\"\">enormous map</a> of the capital, completed in 1827, I get a sense of the direction of this traffic. To the west, demand: the newly opened private anatomy schools. To the east, supply: the narrow streets of Whitechapel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398050304\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1349015016827/James-Legg-plaster-cast-a-010.jpg\" alt=\"James Legg plaster cast at the Museum of London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservator Jill Barnard installs the 19th-century anatomical plaster cast of convicted murderer James Legg.

The bright white plaster cast of the criminal James Legg, his body flayed, is attached to a black wooden cross. At the time, the only legal means of obtaining a fresh corpse was from the gallows. Anatomists at the Royal Academy of Arts acquired Legg's body in order to make more accurate depictions of Christ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398050305\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350655081862/Tattooed-human-skin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tattooed human skin\" width=\"460\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fragment of tattooed skin from John Bishop or Thomas Williams.

In 1831 Thomas Williams and John Bishop were convicted of murdering a young boy for sale to the anatomy schools. In a macabre twist, their own corpses were delivered to the surgeon's table following execution. I peer down at fragments of their tattooed skin, preserved after the dissection, the hairs still visible. The exhibition is at its most powerful when it makes the visitor feel uneasy: I can't help but think that the display of criminal remains serves as a repetition of their punishment.</p> <p>Responding to the panic caused by body snatchers such as the infamous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Burkers\" title=\"\">London Burkers</a>, parliament passed the Anatomy Act in 1832. It certainly freed the anatomy schools from their reliance on the nefarious resurrection men. But it did so in part by expanding the legal supply of bodies: any \"unclaimed\" corpse could now be used for dissection. Much as before, London's most vulnerable were rarely in a position to ensure their wishes were met.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398050306\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350654513038/Dissected-human-skull-003.jpg\" alt=\"Dissected human skull\" width=\"460\" height=\"456\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poorer patients did not always escape the anatomy schools.

Stepping through, the space evokes both the 19th-century anatomical theatre and the public gallery at Westminster. Booming male voices, the landed gentry sitting in the Commons, argue the pros and cons of the Act. \"Will it benefit the poor?\" one calls out. The exhibition provides a stark answer to his question: the dissected skeletal remains of a London labourer sit silently in the centre of the room, the skull sawn in half. That's what Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men does best: juxtaposing contemporary archaeology with historical comment.</p> <p>Moving on, I notice a display of satirical cartoons next to a copy of the Anatomy Act. One cartoon is entitled \"Studying\" above an image of surgeons hacking away at a corpse. Another contrasts the secure burial chambers of the wealthy with the shallow graves of the poor. The political reformer William Cobbett summed up the public mood: \"Let them have the bodies of the rich, for whose benefit science is cultivated.\"</p> <p>As I enter the final brightly lit room I'm offered a chance to reflect on the current state of the law. A contemporary consent form is positioned next to an intricate 19th-century anatomical drawing, for which the \"sitter\" did not give his permission. Given the Department of Health's recent <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/06/consultation-regulators/\" title=\"\">consultation</a> on the future of the <a href=\"http://www.hta.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Human Tissue Authority</a>, this is a particularly timely exhibit.</p> <p>Reports such as <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_117691\" title=\"\">Liberating the NHS</a> paint the regulation of human remains as an issue of marginal importance for the NHS. In fact, as this exhibition aptly shows, the ownership and movement of human tissue affects everything from funeral processions and museum displays to archaeological digs and private medical research. As in the 1800s, dissection today is as much a political activity as a medical one.</p>",

  "<p>Chances are the Coca-Cola can you drank from at lunchtime, the plane that flew you on your last holiday and the iPad on which you might be reading this article were made with metal from Alcoa, the world's third largest aluminium company.</p> <p>Aluminium is so energy intensive that it is often described as \"solid electricity\". Smelters account for around 3.5% of global electricity consumption, but it is difficult to imagine the modern world without this ubiquitous mineral.</p> <p>By definition, extractive industries are also environmentally and socially invasive and can cause shining sustainability targets to lose their lustre in the mines, smelters and manufacturing processes. But under Kevin Anton, the company's first chief sustainability officer (CSO) since 2010, Alcoa claims it is leading the industry in a cleaner, greener direction.</p> <p>\"Because we are an extractive industry, sustainability needs to be front and centre on the agenda,\" he said.</p> <p>Alcoa's activities are so large \u2013 $25.9bn (\u00a316bn) in revenues last year \u2013 that even small changes can have a huge impact. Unlike sectors with a lighter environmental footprint, such as software or retail, companies in extractive heavy industries face extreme challenges in raising the bar on sustainability.</p> <p>While \"sustainable aluminium\" may seem like magical thinking, for Anton, the event that landed him the CSO role was nothing short of a miracle.</p> <p>On a chilly January afternoon in 2009, at the peak of the financial crisis, Anton boarded US Airways flight 1549 destined for Charlotte, North Carolina. Just moments after take-off from LaGuardia Airport, New York, Canada geese struck the engines, forcing the pilot to land on the Hudson River.</p> <p>For Anton, who was helping steer the company through the banking crisis at the time, the \"unscheduled landing\" was something of an epiphany.</p> <p>\"After the plane incident, I was back to work the next day,\" he said. \"Some of my co-passengers reflected on it immediately. I reflected on it six months later: do I want my legacy to be as a great metals trader, a great finance guy or to make a difference in people's lives?\"</p> <p>Instead of volunteer work or a switch to the non-profit sector, he decided to try to create change from within. His ideas to boost Alcoa's sustainability drive were warmly received by Klaus Kleinfeld, chairman and chief executive officer.</p> <p>Alcoa's global operations in 31 countries have already benefited from concerted efforts to embrace the triple bottom line \u2013 people, profits and planet \u2013 according to Anton. The company also has a public issues committee in its board to review the progress of sustainability goals and a scheme that incentivises all staff to meet those goals.</p> <p>Last year, it ran 650 programmes to reduce energy consumption and emissions that led to cost savings of $100m (\u00a362m) while meeting their greenhouse gas (GHG) targets, said Anton.</p> <p>Product lines are also changing, with innovations in lighter alloys for the aviation industry that can increase fuel efficiency by 12% and a silver Cradle to Cradle certificate rating for its beverage sheets.</p> <p>\"If the product side wasn't there, maybe we wouldn't have the right to operate,\" said Anton. \"But we do make products that make the world better and help build our social licence to operate.\"</p> <p>By switching power sources to 66% hydropower, Alcoa has reduced carbon dioxide intensity by 23% between 2005 and 2011 and reduced its total emissions from 57.6m tonnes of CO2 in 2007 to 47.3m tonnes of C02 in 2011.</p> <p>Alcoa was so successful at GHG reductions that it exceeded its targets and had to reset them this spring; 30% reduction by 2020 and 35% by 2030, but those goals will become harder as the global economy recovers.</p> <p>The company also still produces more GHG emissions than the whole of Slovakia, for example, according to the latest data from the European Environment Agency.</p> <p>In addition, the emissions impact of aluminium does not end with carbon. Aluminium manufacturing produces perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which have global warming potentials up to 9,200 times greater than CO2, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p> <p>Unregulated toxic byproducts such as chromium, cobalt, nickel and arsenic also put Alcoa high up the list of <a href=\"http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic100/\" title=\"\">Toxic 100 US</a> companies in an annual survey conducted by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p> <p>This year's Toxic 100 released in August shows Alcoa was ranked 20th, largely because of chemicals such as cobalt \u2013 a known carcinogen \u2013 coming from its alloy processing facilities. The EPA requires facilities to report these toxic emissions, not reduce them.</p> <p>Alcoa claims it has voluntarily and dramatically reduced emissions of unregulated toxins. At least one US facility has introduced technology that has reduced cobalt emissions from 252lbs in 2007 to less than 4lbs in 2011.</p> <p>Overseas, Anton also claims that Alcoa's extractive activities are also \"beyond compliance.\" Although nearly 75% of all aluminium produced since 1888 is still in use today, demand continues for new sources of bauxite, the raw material for aluminium.</p> <p>Many deposits are in pristine environments in developing countries and in addition to the dilemma that arises from the environmental degradation caused by extracting natural resources, there is also economic tension in those developing countries.</p> <p>Conrad Savy, director of responsible mining and energy at <a href=\"http://www.conservation.org/about/pages/about_us.aspx\" title=\"\">Conservation International</a>, said: \"We demand these minerals every day for all kinds of things. But three out of every four mineral-dependent countries are developing countries that want to emerge from poverty.</p> <p>\"It's a lot more complex than simply finding alternatives to aluminium, it's a huge economic driver.\"</p> <p>In 2000, Alcoa purchased one of the world's largest deposits of high-grade bauxite in Juruti. The company plans to extract 700m tonnes over the next 30 years and ship it for export via a 50km railway built by the company.</p> <p>Alcoa claims that it is attempting to set a new benchmark in conservation, habitat rehabilitation and social responsibility. After local protests, Alcoa entered into a royalty sharing agreement with the Juruti community.</p> <p>Patricia Bai\u00e3o, institutional relations director at Conservation International in Brazil, said: \"Alcoa's mining operation in Juruti has held up to expectations and we have good experience with it on the ground. It is very different from other mining projects which have historically been very bad for environmental and social issues.\"</p> <p>There is a bottom line advantage to adopting best practice to mitigate risk that would hurt profits. Savy said that banks often have conditions on environmental and social standards attached to loans. National legislation has also reached a high standard in countries like Brazil and industry associations such as the International Council on Mining and Metals sets a code of practice \u2013 however this is still voluntary.</p> <p>\"Even big companies borrow from global financial institutions and want to manage their financial and reputational risks,\" said Savy.</p> <p>Extractive industries earned such a bad reputation in developing countries that exploitation of natural resources continues to be a divisive issue. Recent scandals such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/trafigura-lessons-toxic-waste-dumping\" title=\"\">Trafigura toxic waste dumping scandal</a> serve as a reminder that grubby practices still continue behind the scenes.</p> <p>Kirsty Jenkinson, director of the markets and enterprise programme at the World Resources Institute in Washington, said: \"There are two camps. One that says pristine areas must stay that way. But there is another community that says, it's modern life, until as consumers we stop demanding this level of development and products, we need to encourage responsible mining.</p> <p>She added: \"If there's a new find in mineral reserves, you can bet those companies are going to be rewarded by the markets and shareholders for delivering that.</p> <p>\"It's very challenging to imagine a world where we cap growth and companies extracting new deposits. The whole economic model would have to change before we could put those kinds of limits in place.\"</p> <p>Alcoa says it is attempting to recalibrate the balance between environmental impact, local stakeholders and long-term shareholder value that distances it from rivals.</p> <p>\"Sustainability is maturing in our industry, but Alcoa is the most mature,\" says Anton. \"Others are catching up but we will run fast, so they can't catch up. Are we fully there? You're never fully there. But have we made a lot of progress in the last two years?\"</p> <p>It remains to be seen how much of an impact Anton will have from within. But if the company's claims ring true and as long as demand still drives extractive industries, it's a step in the right direction.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Skyfall, which stars <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/14/judi-dench-interview-skyfall\" title=\"\">Judi Dench</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/12/javier-bardem-skyfall-bond-interview\" title=\"\">Javier Bardem</a>, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw, currently has a 97% \"fresh\" rating <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/skyfall/\" title=\"\">on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes</a>, making it by far the best-reviewed blockbuster of 2012 thus far. Hollywood experts have also predicted it could be the most successful film of the series at the box office.</p> <p>Mendes also said during the interview that he was surprised how little he had to shift his film-making instincts to shoot Skyfall, which arrives 50 years after the first Bond film, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/25/my-favourite-bond-film-dr-no\" title=\"\">Dr No</a>, hit cinemas. The long-running spy series is famous for a rigid format that has often left directors struggling to stamp their mark on the suave secret agent.</p> <p>\"I don't think I realised how crystallised my opinions were until I sat down and said: 'This is the Bond movie I want to make,'\" said Mendes. \"When I first started making movies, I was shocked by how many opinions I had about how to make them. It felt like that with this. This is the Bond movie I want to see. But it's also the Bond I think an audience wants to see, and also that Ian Fleming himself might have enjoyed.</p> <p>\"I am surprised at the degree to which it feels like my film. I'm not claiming ownership of the whole thing. It takes the work of hundreds of other people, literally. Thousands, even. But I don't feel like I had to change myself to make it.'</p> <p>Few directors have made more than one Bond film in recent times, with the exception being Martin Campbell (albeit 11 years apart for 1995's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/26/my-favourite-bond-film-goldeneye\" title=\"\">GoldenEye</a> and 2006's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/103963/casino.royale\" title=\"\">Casino Royale</a>). However, Terence Young shot three films \u2013 Dr No, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/24/favourite-bond-from-russia-with-love\" title=\"\">From Russia with Love</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/oct/31/nicholas-lezard-favourite-james-bond-thunderball\" title=\"\">Thunderball</a> \u2013 between 1962 and 1965, and Guy Hamilton managed four between 1964's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79341/goldfinger\" title=\"\">Goldfinger</a> and 1974's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/03/favourite-bond-man-golden-gun\" title=\"\">The Man with the Golden Gun</a>. Were Mendes to return, it would mark a serious coup for production company Eon and studios Sony and MGM.</p> <p>Skyfall hits UK cinemas next Friday, 26 October, and arrives in the US on 9 November (8 November in Imax cinemas).</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's hopes of attracting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/10/police-commissioners-star-quality-shine\" title=\"\">\"big local figures\" and not just politicians</a> to contest next month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/10/police-crime-commissioner-elections-leap?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">police commissioner elections</a> have been dashed with the disclosure that three-quarters of those standing for the main parties already hold elected office.</p> <p>A Guardian/Police Foundation data analysis of the 199 declared candidates shortly before the close of nominations at noon on Friday also reveals the Liberal Democrats have adopted a half-hearted approach to the coalition policy, with only 23 candidates standing in the 41 police force contests.</p> <p>The analysis confirms the elections will be an overwhelmingly male affair, with only 34 women standing, just over 17% of the total. Labour is putting forward 15 women candidates, the Conservatives six and Liberal Democrats four.</p> <p>Among the candidates are 13 magistrates, who would have to step down from the bench if they were elected.</p> <p>The prime minister and the home secretary, Theresa May, expressed the hope that a new breed of independent, high-profile figures could be persuaded to stand for the powerful new posts. Winners will be able to to hire and fire chief constables, set police budgets, hold the police to account and develop a wide role in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>But while the tally of nominated candidates includes 63 independents, excluding the minor parties such as Ukip and the English Democrats, more than half are existing police authority members or former police officers, magistrates or military personnel. Few, if any, have more than a local profile.</p> <p>When he launched the hunt for candidates, Cameron said it was \"a big job for a big local figure. It's a voice for the people, someone to lead the fight against crime, and someone to hold the police to account if they don't deliver \u2026 This isn't just for politicians, but for community leaders and pioneers of all sorts. People with real experience who've done real things and run organisations, whether they are charities or companies.\"</p> <p>A string of high-profile candidates who were tipped to run have all dropped out. The first was the Gulf war veteran Colonel Tim Collins, whom May showcased as a Tory candidate during her 2011 Conservative party conference speech. He quit after a dispute over whether he could do the job part-time.</p> <p>Other names canvassed included the TV crime presenter Nick Ross, Falklands veteran <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/02/simon-weston-police-crime-commissioner\" title=\"\">Simon Weston</a>, and former Police Federation chairman Jan Berry. Former ministers who had been tipped for the post included Jacqui Smith, Hazel Blears and Ann Widdecombe, but none has made it to the starting line.</p> <p>Jon Collins, of the Police Foundation, which is tracking candidates, said those standing as independents had only a slim chance of being elected without a party political label. He said most of those standing for the main parties came from a political background.</p> <p>\"It is not a surprise but it is not the way the reform was initially sold,\" said Collins. \"The idea was that some fresh faces without a background in politics might come forward. This group of candidates might not be what might have been expected when the reform was first proposed but it doesn't mean they will not do a good job.\"</p> <p>The police minister, Damian Green, has defended the quality of candidates, saying that any election that attracts a former deputy prime minister \u2013 Lord Prescott \u2013 and a former air chief marshall \u2013 Sir Clive Loader \u2013 must be worthwhile.</p> <p>Prescott is among seven former Labour ministers who are standing. The party has 24 current or former councillors among its 41 candidates, who include 12 who are members of the police authorities the commissioners will replace. Labour has one former police officer standing: Ron Hogg, who was deputy chief constable of Durham.</p> <p>The Conservatives have two former MPs standing, including Michael Mates, who resigned as a Northern Ireland minister over his connection with the jailed tycoon Asil Nadir. There are 24 current or former councillors among their 41 candidates \u2013 the same as Labour. They have five former police officers and eight ex-military figures, including Loader, who names Ronald Reagan as his political hero. The Tory candidate in Essex, Nicholas Alston, a defence and security expert, is the son of a former Essex chief constable and was born in a police station.</p> <p>Nineteen of the 23 Liberal Democrat candidates are current or former councillors. The other four are former police or military officers.</p> <p>Of the 63 independents, there are four chairs of police authorities who are campaigning to keep politics out of policing, while 22 are former police officers or from a military background.</p>",
  "<p>Asus, a Taiwanese technology company with big ambitions in the mobile device market, has advanced what was already an innovative notion: a combination phone and tablet in which a smartphone slides into a slot in the tablet and serves as its mobile data connection. The upcoming hybrid system, called the <a href=\"http://www.asus.com/Mobile/PadFone2/\">Padfone 2</a>, is an updated version of an earlier model, and is much lighter.</p> <p>Still, it's sizeable. The phone and tablet boast 4.7-inch and 10.1-inch screens respectively, though together they are said to weigh about the same as an iPad. A key value proposition for many users will be using one data plan for both devices \u2013 a genuine advantage given the mobile carriers' tendency to gouge their customers for every spare dollar.</p> <p>I can imagine why a serious road warrior might find the Padfone 2 a compelling product, especially when it's coupled with a keyboard. As the Android operating system advances, there's more potential to use these devices for a variety of computing chores, though it's not fully ready yet.</p> <p>For my part, though I love the idea, I'm not likely to buy a Padfone. My current gear includes a large-screen phone and a 7-inch tablet, which I find to be a better size for daily activities (in Asian cities I've visited recently, I've noticed lots of people using 5-inch mini-tablets; we all have different ideas about what works best once we have a device larger than a phone).</p> <p>Even though combining devices is a fine one, especially to avoid paying greedy carriers twice for essentially the same service, there's an even more logical way to do it than what Asus offers. The phone should be tiny, with two functions only: voice and data (which will soon be combined in any case on advanced networks). Then use the phone as a tether or wi-fi hotspot, and do pretty much everything else on a tablet, small or large.</p> <p>My Nexus 7 is wi-fi only, and I often run it using my phone as the connection to the Internet. My <a href=\"http://ting.com\">mobile carrier</a>, unlike most, believes that data is data \u2013 period. And I pay for data on an overall plan; I'm not required to make additional payments just to use the phone as a hotspot or tethering device. Most American mobile carriers, especially the major ones, hate this idea, of course, and they insist on separate tethering plans unless customers pay extortionate rates that \"allow\" them to do the logical thing.</p> <p>I'm encouraging my current carrier \u2013 and would encourage all carriers \u2013 to push manufacturers to create small, limited-function Android handsets for such purposes, and then to sell bundled packages that include small phones with tablets (large and small as users prefer), with software tweaks \u2013 such as automatically switching the phone's hotspot function on when the tablet tries to connect to a digital network \u2013 to ensure that they work well together. I suspect there would be a non-trivial customer base for this setup.</p> <p>One useful aspect to doing things this way is that it can be more secure. When I connect my tablet to any wi-fi network, I immediately then connect to a virtual private network (VPN) that encrypts all traffic over the air, including email, browsing and other connections (a well-managed combination system like the one I'm describing should include VPN connections by default, in my view).</p> <p>The drawback, of course, is that lots of people would rather just do everything in one device. And there are occasions when I'd prefer to just glance at email or check my Twitter feeds on the phone rather that pull out a tablet. But as a frequent traveler, one of my main goals is reducing weight and bulk in what I carry.</p> <p>Sooner than later, we'll be separating radios from screens in any case. Using the phone's radio as a frequent on-the-move connection to the Internet is only going to make more sense in the future. Screens on small slabs are not going to be the way we see the cyber-world for much longer. Google's <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+projectglass\">Glass project</a> \u2013 heads-up displays inside eyeglasses \u2013 and other systems like it are going to win adherents quickly as the technology gets more robust and easy to use.</p> <p>The notion that everything has to be part of a single device is a vestige of a technology past that is quickly coming to a close. I'd like to get started now, and hope the mobile industry will accommodate me.</p>",

  "<p>I died for the first time in my friend's kitchen at university. Armed only with a six-shot revolver, I ran down the stairs of their student house away from two zombies only to go down when a third emerged unexpectedly from a doorway and mauled me, slowing me enough for the others to catch up. I went down yelling.</p> <p>That was one of my first experiences with live games. Five years later, as part of one of the games I help to run, 40 or so surviving players armed with revolvers, shotguns, axes, clubs, and (in four memorable cases) Morris dancing sticks with bells on their legs retreated away from a mob of about 80 zombies, many they'd fought alongside just minutes before, desperately hoping they could keep them away for long enough to get the doors of the mall open and escape. Heart-pounding, adrenaline-pumping, epic combat \u2013 the sort you normally get in Left 4 Dead, but for real.</p> <p>Live games \u2013 as distinct from board games, video games, card games and so on \u2013 are the sort of games you played in the playground as a kid. Some have more in common with sports than anything else, and are played competitively, while others have much more in common with improvisational theatre and encourage much more collaborative play, with winners and losers emerging more through story than through mechanics. There's a growing body of interesting games that merge digital and live mechanics \u2013 <a href=\"http://gutefabrik.com/joust.html\">Johann Sebastian Joust</a> is an obvious one, but it's a young field and more pop up every time you turn around. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398048196\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2012/10/19/1350652805756/Live-action-gaming-008.jpg\" alt=\"Live action gaming\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Live action gaming</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Live games is becoming an umbrella term that covers a lot of ground. At one end of the spectrum there's live-action role play \u2013 LARP for short \u2013 which can mean massive, weekend-long events with thousands of players and crew in full costume and kit. At the other, there are five-minute simple games requiring no kit or costume and working with a very simple mechanic - for instance, <a href=\"http://hideandseek.net/2012/09/05/weekender-game-punch-the-custard/\">Punch the Custard</a>, a fairly self-explanatory game featured at the recent Hide &amp; Seek Weekender. </p> <p>The games I help to design and run, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/grant-howitt\">Grant Howitt</a> as lead designer, tend to fall somewhere between the two. We've been making games for more than six years, mostly <a href=\"http://zombielarp.co.uk\">zombie-related ones</a>, though we've been branching out into sweetshop-based heists and, this Sunday, will be running <a href=\"http://srsbsns.co.uk/alvh.html\">a new game</a> to coincide with the launch of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter on Blu-Ray. </p> <p>After a lot of experimentation \u2013 including a dramatically unsuccessful attempt to tell a story to players in the way Final Fantasy games do, which ended up with the players shooting at our main set pieces and running away \u2013 we always try to build systems that let stories emerge naturally from what players do. If you've played Day Z or Minecraft, you'll have had a taste of what happens when game creators let players decide how to act and what to do within a game world; we try to make that happen in real life.</p> <p>Admittedly, \"real life\" is something of a misnomer when you're trying to get people to pretend they're part of a zombie outbreak or defending a building against a vampire attack. The biggest challenge live games face is getting people \u2013 by which I mean adults \u2013 to suspend their disbelief, stop being cynical and lose themselves, either in a simple but often very silly activity, or in pretending to be something they're not. Live games \u2013 and this may sound obvious \u2013 also take place in physical space, where there might be other people around who aren't playing, so creators have to think about setting, boundaries and making a distinction between players and audience. </p> <p>It also means no flying, no teleportation, no disobeying the laws of physics, and no magical effects unless you can physically represent (phys-rep) them in some way. Large fantasy systems often have rules about kit and equipment, requiring people within the play space to stick to in-character props - no electric torches in a Victorian townhouse, <a href=\"http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/odyssey/\">no modern tents in Rome</a> \u2013 which can also mean some stunning theatrical moments. A friend tells me of a small horror LARP he went to on an island, which rowed its players across to the site in a small boat. Halfway across, a scuba-diver in monster costume emerged from the water, dragged a participant \u2013 who was in on the surprise \u2013 into the water and then shared oxygen with them so they didn't come back up to the surface again.</p> <p>Other games use much smaller, intimate systems: Delerium, a live game set in a psychiatric hospital, used blinks and hand gestures as its main communication mechanic, adding to the sense of paranoia. Others, like the games we run, focus on tools that make actions feel as realistic as possible, but that perhaps don't look quite as realistic. If you're pretending hard enough it's possible to ignore things that don't quite look real, especially if they work right. </p> <p>So NERF guns and Buzz Bee guns are great mechanical abstractions, and cored foam LARP weapons that look like fire axes and baseball bats are picked for their heft and the satisfaction of swinging them as much as for their looks.</p> <p>People play live games for all sorts of reasons. We tend to find two groups of players at our events: those who come for the story, to pretend to be something, and those who come for the mechanics, to try to win. People go to live games with friends, for community, the way others play MMOs; people aim to test their skills, to master something new, to try on characters they might not otherwise explore, or to lose themselves in a moment of escapism and flow. </p> <p>Many want more than one of these things at once. But the rewards for playing a live game are often more visceral than those for playing a video game \u2013 the adrenaline and emotion run more highly, the skills much less abstract, the experience far more intense. Plus it's surprisingly good fun to play dress up, to test the rules of a game world, and to make something creative and exciting with your friends.</p> <p>And for me, as a designer, there's an enormous thrill in the stories that are born from the games we create. There's nothing better than listening to your players tell stories you helped make happen, excitedly going over the events of the game between them, lost in the retelling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398048197\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2012/10/19/1350652744467/Live-action-gaming-008.jpg\" alt=\"Live action gaming\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Live action gaming</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Encouraging people to play together, and being part of the glorious experiences they build, is worth all the hours of debate, writing, wrangling, ordering obscure props off the internet and working out precisely how to program the zombies so the game balances on a knife edge. When it all works right, you get to be a tiny god, and the results of your creations are always so much more exciting than anything you could envisage beforehand.</p> <p>Live games are a hugely diverse and growing field, with a lot of experimentation going on \u2013 much like most other forms of game right now. But the main objectives for most games are remarkably similar to those for video games: make a fun experience through playful, fair mechanics, and often give players a story to explore or to create themselves. We share a vast common set of ideas and systems with video game designers \u2013 from social game structures and collaborative systems that encourage altruism to emergent and procedural design. Getting away from the controller is just another way to play.</p> <h2><strong>Forthcoming events</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.adoorinawall.com/Events.aspx\">Apocalypse How?</a> \u2013 a London treasure hunt, with various dates in October and November. <br><a href=\"http://www.fire-hazard.net/events/36\">Wink Murder</a> \u2013 Gothic horror and parlous games at London Bridge (2 November)<br><a href=\"http://www.skullduggerylarp.co.uk/\">Skullduggery</a> \u2013 Live action role-playing in the woodlands of Kent (next event 29 October) <br><a href=\"http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/event/Tickets?1\">Empire Winter Solstice event</a> \u2013 \"a game of politics and epic battles set in a richly-detailed fantasy world\" (March 29 to April 1 2013)<br><a href=\"http://www.larpcamp.co.uk/\">LARP Camp</a> \u2013 A huge range of LARP events and talks at Huntley Wood, Staffordshire (5-7 July 2013) <br><a href=\"http://srsbsns.co.uk/alvh.html\">Vampire Hunting Live</a> \u2013 A two-hour live gaming session based around the movie, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.

  "<p>Training to become a barrister or solicitor is a competitive and expensive business. The legal profession has made efforts to become more accessible to aspiring lawyers from all backgrounds and to increase the diversity of its members, but the financial cost remains an enormous barrier for many.</p> <p>Faced with paying university tuition fees, the ridiculously expensive costs of the professional training courses and then funding themselves through a training contract or pupillage, many find themselves starting their working life with enormous debts.</p> <p>That's the scary part, but don't be discouraged. Bursaries, scholarships and grants that do not have to be repaid are available to students during undergraduate law degrees through to the graduate diploma in law and professional training courses and training contracts or pupillage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, finding where that help comes from, can be a challenge and a bit time-consuming. Here's a guide to what's on offer at the different stages of your journey into the law that might help make it a bit less bumpy.</p> <h2>Undergraduate law degree <br></h2> <p>Most universities now charge the maximum \u00a39,000 a year tuition fees for students on their undergraduate law degrees. While that fee may seem daunting, remember that you do not have to pay it upfront and you will not have to start paying back tuition fee loans until the April after you graduate and are earning at least \u00a321,000 a year.</p> <p>Most universities and colleges offer bursaries and scholarships to help students with their tuition fees, accommodation, maintenance and other expenses. They will, this year spend \u00a3290m on bursaries and reduced tuition fees for poorer students \u2013 a fact <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/18/social-mobility-flatlining-adviser\" title=\"\">criticised this week</a> by the government's social mobility advisor Alan Milburn. He suggested that the money should instead be targeted at helping children from less well off families stay in school.</p> <p>Anyway, for the moment the bursaries and grants remain. Some are made available to first year students either on the basis of their academic achievements at school or financial need, while others are given to reward students for performance during their degree.</p> <p>Details of available funding, criteria, application processes and deadlines can be found on the websites of the individual universities and colleges. It is worth checking both the awards provided by the university, which are open to all students, as well as those provided by the law school or faculty, offered only to students studying a law degree.</p> <p>To get you started, here are a couple that caught my eye: Among some of the undergraduate awards available at <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/February2012/20022012-freshfields-ucl-law-scholarship\" title=\"\">University College London</a> are the Freshfields Scholarships. International law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer provides two awards of \u00a310,000 per year of study, for law students from less privileged backgrounds. Recipients also benefit from eight weeks a year of paid work experience at the firm and an award under the college's bursary scheme to provide additional support of up to \u00a33,500. The awards are designed to assist candidates who aspire to be City lawyers and who have little or no family history of higher education and would become first generation graduates.</p> <p>Queen Mary University London offers scholarships and bursaries to around 50% of its undergraduate body. Among them are a number of \u00a31,000 bursaries awarded on the basis of a student's academic record before joining, as well as second and final year bursaries recognising students' success while at university.</p> <p>Students from families on a low income \u2013 up to \u00a325,000 a year \u2013 can apply for bursaries from their universities to help cover tuition and maintenance fees, under the National Scholarship Programme. A list of participating universities and colleges can be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/student-finance\" title=\"\">from the Directgov website</a>.</p> <h2>Grants </h2> <p>The site also has details of tuition fee loans, maintenance loans and maintenance grants for living expenses. You should apply in the spring of the year that your course starts. Competition is fierce and students are advised to apply as early as possible.</p> <p>If you have children or dependant adults you may be able to apply for additional grants to cover childcare. Those in full-time higher education with children under 15, or under 17 if they have special educational needs, can apply for a childcare grant of up to \u00a3148.75 a week for one child and \u00a3255 for two or more children. Students with disabilities may also be able to benefit from the <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas#overview\" title=\"\">Disabled Students' Allowances</a>.</p> <p><em>Look out for the next article in this series, where Catherine Baksi explores the funding options for the next stage of training</em></p>",

Shock waves from the bullet shattered the thinnest bone of the skull and fragments were driven into the brain.</p> <p>\"The bullet grazed the edge of her brain,\" Rosser said. \"Certainly if you're talking a couple of inches more central, then it's almost certainly an unsurvivable injury.\"</p> <p>Doctors say she has memory but they have not talked to her about the shooting. \"From a lot of work we have done with our military casualties we know that reminding people of traumatic events at this stage increases the potential for psychological problems later, so we wouldn't do that,\" Rosser said.</p> <p>He said Malala was aware of her surroundings, and though she couldn't talk because she had a tracheotomy tube, she had given permission for medical details to be revealed, and wanted to thank everyone for their support.</p> <p>She was still showing some signs of infection, related to the bullet track, but \"she was standing with some help for the first time this morning. She is communicating very freely. She is writing. She has a tracheotomy tube because her airway was swollen by the passing of the bullet, so she is not able to talk, though we have no reason to believe she won't be able to talk once this tube is out, which may be in the next few days.\"</p> <p>The specialist doctors, who have expertise in treating soldiers with gunshot injuries flown back from Afghanistan, said it was a \"fluid situation\" and Malala had suffered \"a very, very grave injury\". She will need a couple of weeks to rehabilitate before her skull will need to be reconstructed and work may be carried out on her jaw.</p> <p>Rosser said it was too early to say whether there would be \"any subtle intellectual or memory deficit down the line\". But in terms of function, \"she is able to understand, she has some memory, I am led to believe, she is able to stand, she's got motor control, she's able to write. It certainly would be over-optimistic to say that there is not going to be any further problems, but it is possible she will make a smooth recovery. It's impossible to tell.\"</p> <p>He said the hospital was trying to arrange for Malala to listen to her father, who remains in Pakistan, on the phone, though she would not be able to speak to him because of the tube. Hospital staff were communicating with her in Urdu, though it was clear she understood English.</p> <p>\"She is keen that people share the details. She is also keen that I thank people for their support and their interest. She is obviously aware of the amount of support and interest this has generated around the world. She is keen to thank people for that,\" Rosser said.</p> <p>Malala was shot <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/09/pakistan-girl-shot-activism-swat-taliban\" title=\"\">along with two classmates</a> as they made their way home from school in north-west Pakistan, in what the foreign secretary, William Hague, described as a \"barbaric attack\".</p>",

  "<p>The concept of \"difficult-second-album syndrome\" has long been recognised by pop music reviewers, with Mumford &amp; Sons perhaps the latest band to discover the speed with which acclaim for originality can be followed by disappointment at brand signatures. But the recent acceleration and expansion of audience reaction to TV, through social networking, has resulted in the followup problem becoming more apparent in this medium as well, with Homeland a high-profile victim. The same general sense of judgment \u2013 an aggregate of reviews, tweets and workplace conversations \u2013 that declared the first run a hit has classified season two as a cause for concern.</p> <p>I've already written here my feeling that a narrative with a natural one-season arc has been distorted into an open-ended form by the commercial demands of American networks, which routinely demand seven-year options from creative teams in case a format becomes a reliable cash line. But Homeland's experience of difficult-second-series syndrome \u2013 a condition that also afflicted Downton Abbey, although commendably avoided by Steven Moffat's and Mark Gattis's Sherlock \u2013 raises the wider question of whether hit shows inevitably decline to the point where viewers are left wanting less. Has a franchise ever finished stronger than it started?</p> <p>Certainly, it's easy to list the hits that became ridiculous through continuing too long \u2013 Dallas, Dynasty, Lost \u2013 and most viewers, if asked to choose their favourite episodes of The West Wing, Ugly Betty or Six Feet Under would surely select episodes from the first two or three years rather than the final two or three, except possibly for the additional weight and excitement of a last-ever episode, such as the finale of The Sopranos.</p> <p>Spooks, which notably showed an increased confidence in tone and theme in its middle series, is a very rare example of a drama that didn't rely for later interest on capital stacked up early on. Revealingly, advance publicity for the American fantasy series The Walking Dead, which begins transmitting its third series in the UK tonight, has deliberately stressed changes and developments between runs, including the casting of the high-class David Morrissey to join fellow Brit Andrew Lincoln.</p> <p>A specialised exception to the tendency for front-loaded runs are the perennial UK soap operas \u2013 such as Coronation Street, EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City \u2013 which have maintained an impressive baseline consistency over the decades, suffering only intermittent dips into risibility, from which they have been lifted by the introduction of new characters or producers. Because a continuing drama is the form of fiction that most resembles life \u2013 with characters ageing in real time and becoming pseudo-friends of the viewers \u2013 a soap can often peak at around five years (as Channel 4's Brookside did), subsequently becoming, like a long marriage, an exercise in surviving the irritations of familiarity.</p> <p>Comedy is a different case. In this genre, the problem to be overcome is often difficult first series syndrome. The late John Sullivan's Only Fools and Horses famously only gained loyalty from viewers and reviewers during its third series and is often correctly cited as a warning to commissioners against writing off a new show too soon. The reason for these slow-burn joke shows \u2013 Miranda is another example of a show that hit gold second time out \u2013 is surely that the classic structure of a joke \u2013 setup followed by punchline \u2013 is written large in the shape of a sitcom: the opening episodes are in some ways a set-up for a later payoff.</p> <p>Factual TV also seems to operate by different rules from drama. Far from wobbling in their second series, concepts such as The X Factor, Strictly Come Dancing, Britain's Got Talent and \u2013 most recently \u2013 The Great British Bake Off really flourished at the second time of asking for an audience; it's generally in the third or fourth series that a talent contest begins to suffer from allegations of predictability. The reason for this, I think, is that a competition format is at its most enjoyable when viewers have a sense of what to expect \u2013 knowing the personality of the judges, the nature of the challenges and the sort of performances most likely to thrive \u2013 whereas dramas work best when the audience doesn't know what's coming.</p> <p>Admittedly, one exception to this law of talent-show familiarity breeding content may turn out to be the return run of BBC1's The Voice, partly because of the strong sense that the singing contest threw away its original twist \u2013 the swivelling chairs that created blind auditions \u2013 too early and was already suffering format fatigue by the end of the first series.</p> <p>The reason that the second album came to be viewed by rock critics as a significant obstacle is that most cultural successes depend for their initial impact on what the late Robert Hughes called \"the shock of the new\". This is certainly true of television drama and so returning work is almost bound to bring diminishing returns. If relationships are supposed to be vulnerable to the seven-year itch, TV fiction is at risk of chafing in the second year, as Homeland shows.</p>",
  "<p>From its beginnings on the bench of a 17th century Dutch chemist, the history of gin has not always been a happy one. Originally intended as a medicine, gin became suddenly affordable in Britain due to changes in the duty levied following the accession of William of Orange to the throne. French brandy prices went through the roof, a great many small-scale gin distilleries were established across London and by the early years of the 18th century what had become known as the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-14/london-gin-craze-had-roots-in-nascent-consumer-society.html\">Gin Craze</a> was truly out of hand. The drunkenness and abandon on display in William Hogarth's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Street_and_Gin_Lane\">Gin Lane</a> (1751) epitomises the widespread misery and dissolution caused by gin, in deliberate contrast to the happy, well-fed workers with their foaming tankards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Street_and_Gin_Lane\">on Beer Street</a>.</p> <p>In the first third of the 19th century, advancements in distillation eventually allowed for the mass-production of pure spirits using <a href=\"http://wiki.homedistiller.org/Continuous_still\">\"continuous\" stills</a>. These spirits were then re-distilled to make \"London dry gin\", the defining stipulations for which are still in force today: it must contain no added sugar, be flavoured primarily with juniper, and a minimum of 37.5% alcohol by volume. </p> <p>Gone were the wide variations in quality and the terrible <a href=\"http://www.gintime.com/features/musing-on-the-quest-for-gin-authenticity/\">adulterants</a> added by earlier generations of unscrupulous distillers, and with the discovery that quinine was effective against malaria the colonial officer class began to drink the new \"tonic water\" enlivened with gin. Now enjoyed in fashionable circles, the rehabilitation of mothers' ruin was complete, with the added bonus that the antimalarial tonic water actually worked.</p> <p>The perception of a link between gin and glamorous living received another fillip in the jazz age. The drinking of cocktails and the culture around them grew and flourished even during American prohibition, and President Roosevelt's first act upon signing the paperwork which repealed the alcohol ban was to mix a martini, using plenty of gin, vermouth and olive brine. The growing popularity of gin cocktails provided the distillers with another challenge: the fruity juniper and citrussy coriander seed flavours which work so well with tonic water are not always ideal in a cocktail. </p> <p>In the last decade or so enthusiasm for interesting gins has grown, and with it, the number of small distillers. One of the newest is <a href=\"http://portobellostarbar.co.uk/portobelloroadgin/\">Portobello Road</a>, a small outfit boasting its own 'Ginstitute', a tiny room above the Portobello Star dedicated to the history and scientific understanding of gin. They offer private tuition and blending classes, run by master distiller and (ahem) ginthusiast Jake Burger, whose encyclopedic knowledge made for a very enjoyable afternoon for our tasting panel. </p> <p>Here are our tasting notes and musings. This isn't a comprehensive list of the gins currently available, it's our panel's pick of those they found most enjoyable, interesting or unusual. There are now almost too many gins to count, each with characteristics as unique as every gin drinker, so please share your loves, hates and serving suggestions. </p> <h2>Bombay Sapphire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074021\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350640530842/Bombay-Sapphire-001.jpg\" alt=\"Bombay Sapphire\" width=\"140\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bombay Sapphire gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leading the way towards the current gin revival, Bombay Sapphire has been around since 1987 and is distilled using a \"carterhead\" still, meaning the botanicals do not come into direct contact with alcohol but are contained in a wire basket above the liquid and the flavours released by vapour alone. This process makes for a less aggressively flavoured spirit, and if you can recover from the disappointment that it's (spoiler alert) not actually blue, you can enjoy a nice warm and spicy gin with a liquorice aftertaste. There's not much citrus, but heavy hints of cinnamon and for those who can detect it, Grains of Paradise.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 40% ABV, RRP \u00a319.99 for 70cl, available in shops nationwide and <a href=\"http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-2249.aspx\">online</a></p> <h2>Adnams First Rate</h2> <p>Made from scratch by Adnams in Suffolk, a company known best for its beers, First Rate is made using an innovative Faraday still which produces a beautifully clear, crystalline spirit. The higher-than-average alcohol content carries bags of fresh juniper and sweet orange flavours alongside wafts of cardamom and thyme. Adding tonic brings fennel and a little liquorice to the party. A really classy gin.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 48% ABV, \u00a325.99 for 50cl, available from Cellar &amp; Kitchen Stores and <a href=\"http://cellarandkitchen.adnams.co.uk/catalog/product/spirits-1/adnams-first-rate-gin-48-abv-50cl\">online</a></p> <h2>Hendrick's</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074022\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350037193213/Hendricks-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Hendrick's gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"245\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hendrick's gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Current darling of many enthusiasts (and named the best in the world by the Wall St Journal a few years back) this excellent gin from Scottish whisky distillers William Grant utilises rose petals and cucumber for a distinctive and memorably fresh taste that's just the right side of floral. Best served with a slice of cucumber, it works beautifully in G&amp;Ts and cocktails. Bartenders may hate the hard-to-pour apothecary-style bottle but it's a smart nod to gin's medicinal history.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 41.4% ABV, RRP \u00a325.29 for 70cl. Stockists include Sainbury's, Waitrose, Peckham's, Harvey Nichols, and also available <a href=\"http://www.oneclickvintage.com/hendricks-70cl-p-1447.html\">online</a></p> <h2>Berkeley Square</h2> <p>A very smooth gin, but big on taste too with quite some heat from the botanicals - makrut lime leaf, basil, lavender, sage - and a bit of sweetness from the liquorice. Perhaps a little too flavoursome for a G&amp;T, this gin would happily stand up in a martini on the rocks.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong>40% ABV, \u00a333.99 for 70cl, available <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=berkeley+square+gin&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#q=berkeley+square+gin&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Os1&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N-52UPyfDoGw0QW4mIE4&amp;ved=0CDgQrQQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=3baa9496d269b1ed&amp;bpcl=35243188&amp;biw=1730&amp;bih=997\">online</a> and in specialist retailers</p> <h2>Sipsmith</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074023\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350640717207/Sipsmith-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sipsmith gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"263\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sipsmith gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Established in 2009, Sipsmith's was the first new copper pot still in London for almost 200 years.

The well-balanced initial flavours give way to a nice peppery finish make a very good G&amp;T. This is the only gin our panel tasted with charitable links (\"5% of the proceeds\" go to <a href=\"http://www.treeaid.org.uk/\">TreeAid</a>) and at the price represents very good value for money.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 42.0% ABV, \u00a320.95 for 70cl, <a href=\"http://www.slurp.co.uk/wine-gifts/gifts-for-special-occasions/23402-whitley-neill-london-dry-gin\">available online</a></p> <h2>Portobello Road</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074024\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350043288542/Portobello-Road-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Portobello Road gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portobello Road gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A superbly balanced, traditional gin with a peppery kick. Nice and ginny without being too heavy on the juniper, and plenty of G&amp;T-friendly fresh citrus and coriander. Enough spicy nutmeg and cassia to stand up for itself in a cocktail, even in the ultimate test of a gin's character, a negroni. Add a twist of grapefruit for the ultimate G&amp;T.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 42%, RRP \u00a324 for 70cl, available from the distiller on Portobello Road, London, and <a href=\"http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-16642.aspx\">online</a></p> <h2>BLOOM</h2> <p>According to the blurb this gin is (as you might expect given the name) \"inspired by the classic aromas of England's country gardens.\" Sure enough our tasters found it \"very floral, but warm too. A bit girly.\" Probably more one for a summer's G&amp;T than a cocktail.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 40% ABV, \u00a328.99 for 70cl, available in Waitrose and specialist retailers</p> <h2>Oliver Cromwell 1599</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074025\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350643444442/Oliver-Cromwell-1599-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Cromwell 1599 gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"208\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Cromwell 1599 gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The surprise winner of the Gin and Vodka Association Trophy a couple of years ago, beating the more famous premium gins.

Note that the \"dry\" on the label refers to the method and not to the taste - angelica, orris root and liquorice give this gin a noticeable sweetness.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 43% ABV (1 litre bottle) or 40% ABV (1.5l and 70cl bottles), \u00a315.69 for 70cl, available <a href=\"http://www.anybooze.com/london-hill-gin-304-p.asp\">online</a> </p> <h2>Berry Bros and Rudd No. 3</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074026\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350047554366/No.-3-London-dry-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"No. 3 London dry gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No. 3 London dry gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Distilled in traditional copper pot stills in Holland, No.3 is designed to reflect the essence of what a good traditional gin should be and meet the modern challenge of marrying well with tonic and in cocktails. With assertive juniper balanced with sweet orange peel and a twist of grapefruit this gin's distinctly citrussy tones are lengthened nicely by a warm backnote provided by cardamom seeds. A bottle would make a nice gift, both for its drinkability and handsome presentation, though the embedded key feels a tad gimmicky.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 46% ABV, RRP \u00a333.65 for 70cl, available at Berry Bros and Rudd, London, Waitrose, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and <a href=\"http://www.bbr.com/producer-1874-no-3-london-dry-gin\">online</a></p> <h2>Spirit of Hven</h2> <p>Billed proudly as an \"organic gin\" from Sweden and made in a tiny distillery, Hven have been producing whisky since 2008 and only recently started making gin, which made a first appearance in the UK at London Cocktail Week 2012. Although just 40% ABV the spirit smells very alcoholic, fumes arriving in the mouth before the taste. Our tasters detected little evidence of juniper, perhaps due to the fresh Swedish berries used rather than imported dried fruits, but there's lots of liquorice bolstered by aniseed and two types of pepper. Not really very ginny, but the makers suggest it can be drunk diluted with only a little water, so perhaps an interesting gift for a gin-lover. <br>Details: 40% ABV, available <a href=\"http://www.loegismose.dk/shop/product/4617/\">online</a> and coming to the UK soon</p> <h2>G'vine Nouaison and Floraison</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074027\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350640905417/GVine-gins-001.jpg\" alt=\"G'Vine gins\" width=\"140\" height=\"201\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">G'Vine gins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This proud pair of \"gins de France\" are intended as alternatives to the classic London dry style. Inextricably linked to the grape vine, they're made in the Cognac region using grape spirit and feature vine flowers among the botanicals. On the palate the delicate floral notes that the vine flowers provide move on to liquorice and end with spicy cassia. Flavours seem quite separate and the gin has more body than a London dry. With tonic, the liquorice and cassia of the Nouaison were a bit overbearing and the interesting floral notes were lost, but the flowery flavours hold up longer and better in the Floraison.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> \u00a340% ABV, Gvine-Floraison \u00a329.49-\u00a332.99, Gvine-Nouaison \u00a330.95-\u00a333.99 for 70cl. Available at over 100 pubs and bars<br>and <a href=\"http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-7242.aspx\">online</a></p> <h2>Blackwood's vintage dry gin</h2> <p>Made with sustainably foraged Shetland botanicals and billed as \"the world's only handpicked gin\" this is a slightly floral spirit with a definite presence of juniper but not much body or heat. Mixed with tonic, however, it comes into its own and was memorably (and slightly worryingly) described by one taster as \"a session gin\".</p> <p>Details: 40% ABV, RRP \u00a317.40 for 70cl, available at Sainsbury's and other retailers and also <a href=\"http://www.thedrinkshop.com/products/nlpdetail.php?prodid=2032&amp;afwinid=90909\">online</a></p> <h2>Monkey 47</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074028\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350647150056/Monkey-47-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Monkey 47 gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"208\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monkey 47 gin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A great gift for the gin connoisseur, beautifully packaged in an apothecary-style bottle. Only a true expert will identify all 47 botanicals, a third of which come from the Black Forest in Germany, where the gin is distilled. The sheer complexity of the flavour makes it a little overpowering in a simple G&amp;T, but it makes a memorable negroni, a fine martini and would make for a very interesting evening's cocktail experimentation.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 50cl, c \u00a338 (about \u00a342 with shipping), available <a href=\"http://www.vodkaemporium.com/product_detail.php?id=1771\">online</a></p> <h2>Little Bird</h2> <p>A strong grapefruit nose, perfectly matched citrus and juniper on first taste give way to hints of spicy coriander and ginger. A little light on spice, but tonic water brings the ginger out to join in a three-pronged attack with the other two big botanicals, and it holds its own surprisingly well in a martini.</p> <p>Details: 41.6% ABV, RRP \u00a329.95 for 70cl, available at Maltby Street Market in London and <a href=\"http://www.drinkfinder.co.uk/spirits/little-bird-london-dry-gin-small-batch-gin-41-6-70cl.html\">online</a></p> <h2>Plymouth</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074029\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350571427118/Plymouth-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Plymouth gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"273\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plymouth gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A unique gin produced in Plymouth since 1793 in the oldest functioning gin distillery in the country, and the only gin to have Protected Designation of Origin status. Long a favourite of the Royal Navy (a Navy strength version is available at 57% ABV) it's recently been repackaged in a handsome, art-deco style bottle. On the nose it's quite fruity, but to taste it's smooth and spicy, more so than a London dry with plenty of cardamom, coriander and some citrus keeping the juniper in check and resulting in a flavour described by some as \"earthy\".</p> <p><strong>Details: </strong>41.2% ABV, \u00a328 for 70cl, available in shops and <a href=\"http://storefront.plymouthgin.com/plymouth-gins-70-cl-/original-strength-1l-/prod_1.html\">online from the distillery</a></p> <h2>Beefeater 24</h2> <p>An updated version of a very well-known classic London dry, the up-front fruit is balanced by a long, spicy finish of coriander and liquorice and the whole flavour profile subtly influenced and bound together by two types of tea. This is an eminently adaptable gin: good in G&amp;Ts and martinis.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 45% ABV, RRP \u00a326 for 70cl, available in off-licences, supermarkets and <a href=\"http://www.masterofmalt.com/gin/beefeater/beefeater-24-gin/?utm_content=beefeater/beefeater-24-gin&amp;utm_source=database&amp;utm_medium=base&amp;utm_campaign=mom_base_1\">online</a></p> <h2>Martin Miller's Super Premium</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074030\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350647310407/Martin-Millers-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Miller's gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"193\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Miller's gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the market since 1999 this spirit is hailed as a pioneer in the current wave of high-end gins. It was the first to use cucumber as a botanical, and the distiller's obsessive attention to detail is given as the reason for shipping the spirit to Iceland for bottling with local spring water before importing the finished gin in to the UK. Many people who say they don't really like gin do like this one, the major difference with a more traditional London dry being beefed-up angelica and orris root notes with hints of violets, and a spicy finish carried home by nutmeg and cassia bark. Floral on the nose, with juniper following. An interesting and modern gin, particularly good in cocktails.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong>40% ABV, RRP \u00a325 for 70cl, available from Ocado, Wine Rack, Nicholas, Oddbins and <a href=\"http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/product-is-50504?cmp=GoogleBase&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Shopping&amp;utm_campaign=shopping&amp;utm_content=50504\">online</a></p> <h2>Gilpin's Westmorland Extra Dry</h2> <p>On the market since March 2012 this traditionally-made spirit has been impressively well-received, winning a gold in the 2012 International Wine &amp; Spirit Competition. Born of a desire to make the ultimate martini, this is a gentlemanly gin with earthy botanicals (sage, borage) and a hefty ABV in a chunky cologne-style bottle. The style is classic London dry achieved using eight botanicals, three of them citrus peels. Juniper and coriander seed (and the alcohol) give it a good kick, without becoming overwhelming. Best in a martini or a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_%28cocktail%29\">gibson</a>.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 47% ABV, \u00a337.50 for 70cl, available at Gerry's, Soho Wines, Amathus and <a href=\"http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-17351.aspx\">online</a> </p> <h2>Tanqueray No 10</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398074031\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350640629893/Tanqueray-no-Ten-gin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tanqueray no Ten gin\" width=\"140\" height=\"263\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanqueray no Ten gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Presented in a handsome green fluted bottle, this version of Tanqueray is clean and crisp with a nose poised between coriander and juniper. Tasting a nip reveals a boozy heat, turns up the intensity of these two main botanicals and reveals a pleasant peppery finish. It's surprisingly subtle in a G&amp;T due to its well-muddled flavours, and if you like a slow-burning lingering spicy finish, you'll like this gin. Where it really shines, though is in a martini where the smoothness, bottling strength and complex character can really come into their own.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong>47.3% ABV, \u00a327.99 for 70cl, available in off-licenses, supermarkets and <a href=\"http://www.simplywinesdirect.co.uk/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=609&amp;idcategory=36&amp;idaffiliate=3\">online</a> </p> <h2>Williams Chase Apple Gin</h2> <p>All gins start life as pure spirit which is then redistilled, but unusually this one traces its origins back to cider apples, this Herefordshire distillery priding itself on producing spirits entirely from scratch rather than buying the alcohol in. It leaves you in no doubt that it is alcoholic with a fiery kick, and bottled at 48% ABV it's intended for cocktails. Once the heat calms down there's a good depth of flavour with lots of liquorice and a pinch of juniper.<br><strong>Details:</strong> 48% ABV, about \u00a335 for 70cl, available <a href=\"http://www.thedrinkshop.com/products/nlpdetail.php?prodid=6389&amp;afwinid=90909\">online</a> </p> <h2>Williams Chase London Dry</h2> <p>Distilled from potatoes and using juniper buds as well as berries this smells lovely - leading with juniper, following with floral notes and ending up pleasantly cinnamony. To taste it's very hot with a strong liquorice aftertaste, quite fleeting on the tongue but the flavour builds and builds. Good with tonic.</p> <p><strong>Details:</strong> 40% ABV.

  "<p>The true extent of energy companies' recent price hikes and the complexity of their tariffs is emerging, with one household facing an increased electricity bill of nearly 20%.</p> <p>When Trevor and Maxine Wadlow received a letter from npower informing them that electricity prices were going up, they were shocked to discover that their annual bill is to increase by 17.8%. The rise is nearly double the average 9.1% <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/12/npower-british-gas-raise-prices\" title=\"\">announced by npower on 12 October</a>, the calculation for which is based on the standard annual consumption, and includes the prices for all payment methods and locations.</p> <p>In the letter, npower told the Wadlows their rise was due to a number of factors. It said: \"It's costing us more in taxes and obligations to carry out government environmental and social schemes; we're having to pay more to the companies who look after the distribution networks that deliver energy to your home; the energy we've bought to supply your home and others this winter is more expensive than last year.\"</p> <p>In February 2012 the Wadlows decided to purchase their electricity from npower, opting for the Sign On Line 24 plan \u2013 a \"variable\" tariff, which was discounted for a year. The confusing price plan guaranteed that the cost would be at least 2% lower than npower's standard offline variable tariff until 3 February 2013. But more confusing still, the terms and conditions also state that charges for single fuel customers \"will vary and may be higher than npower's standard charges\".</p> <p>In the Wadlow's case it means that, with three months left to run on their \"discounted\" deal, they now face an unexpected double-digit increase which, on an annual basis, would add the equivalent of \u00a3100 to their electricity bill of around \u00a3550.</p> <p>The couple say npower also failed to inform them, as a matter of course, about the best deals for them to move onto once their existing product agreement runs out \u2013 something that will be mandatory under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/19/energy-firms-customers-cheapest-tariff\" title=\"\">new Ofgem measures announced on Friday</a>.</p> <p>Trevor Wadlow, who runs Norfolk-based charity Kickstart, said: \"There will be people worse off than us who will be shocked by this rise. But we're angry because of the principle. Increases of 9.1% have been widely publicised but the true cost to households is much higher.\"</p> <p>When Wadlow rang npower to request that he be switched to a cheaper tariff, he was told he would have to pay an exit penalty of \u00a320. \"It's scandalous that you can buy a product that promises a discount for a year, only to be 17.8% more expensive after a matter of months,\" he added.</p> <p>A spokesman for nPower said: \"The increases announced recently by all suppliers relate to standard tariffs, this is made quite clear in all the press releases and is based on Ofgem national consumption levels. The Wadlows are on a much cheaper tariff than standard, it says it quite clearly at the top of the second page (Sign on Line 24).\"</p> <p>Wadlow responded: \"We are on a cheap tariff, but we consider ourselves standard consumers of electricity, so we do not understand why our tariff has had to rise by 17.8%. It's all about profit and ensuring npower can pay dividends to shareholders \u2013 at customers' expense.\"</p> <p>In its last complete financial year, npower's parent company RWE Group (listed on the German stock exchange) paid a dividend of \u20ac2 per share \u2013 equivalent to a handout of \u00a31.23bn to shareholders.</p> <p>On the npower website, in the section where users can check how the forthcoming price rise will affect them, the firm makes no mention of a 17.8% rise for Sign On Line 24 customers. It merely says: \"The average dual fuel Direct Debit customer on this online tariff will still be paying less than on our standard tariff until the discount period ends on 3 February 2013.\"</p> <p>Joe Malinowski of theenergyshop.com warns consumers to avoid variable rate tariffs. \"Prices are only going to rise at this point and variable tariffs allow suppliers to increase their prices even when the product is fixed.

It is timed to link with <a href=\"http://findingada.com/\" title=\"\">Ada Lovelace Day</a> earlier this week, an event that seeks to share stories about inspirational women in science.</p> <p>Admitting that Wikipedia is a first port of call for most people looking for basic, and sometimes not so basic, biographical information, the event is an attempt to improve the quality of entries and raise the profile of women in science and engineering, both past and present. Not simply relying on other online resources, participants will be able to make use of the Royal Society's unique collections, as well as its library staff and representatives of Wikipedia UK.</p> <p>The society's library is enjoying its 350th anniversary this year, although it is only for the past 67 years that women <a href=\"http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/06/30/rsnr.2010.0043?cited-by=yes&amp;legid=roynotesrec;rsnr.2010.0043v1\" title=\"\">have been admitted as fellows</a>. Despite increasing efforts to ensure a level playing field, female fellows are still a tiny minority, being only 5% of <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/\" title=\"\">the total</a>. Awareness of this disparity undoubtedly makes the Royal Society keen to focus on celebrating successful women in science and on inspiring the next generation.</p> <p>The event itself raises some interesting themes and ideas. The most obvious is the fact that the contribution of women to science, and elsewhere, can be made more visible. Our view of what counts in the history of science is very much influenced by older assumptions and past prejudices. Prizes, publications, professional positions and fellowships are key markers, and automatically lead to commemoration of achievements in obituaries, which are the first drafts of future biographies. Women were, of course, generally barred from such recognition until all too recently.</p> <p>Other markers, therefore, need to be sought and added into our accounts, and Wikipedia is the kind of cumulative and fluid environment in which this can be done.</p> <p>When looking for the women, and for those other markers of eminence, researchers find themselves beginning to think about what counts as an important contribution to science in a slightly different way. There is, necessarily, less emphasis on the traditional roll call of theoretical advances (of the Copernicus-Kepler-Newton-Einstein variety)</p> <p>and an appreciation of the essential contribution that collectors, experimentalists, technicians, writers, translators, teachers and calculators have made.</p> <p>This, by rights, should lead to the widening of the net of scientific biography to include a whole load of underappreciated men as well. Some, such as top instrument makers, were seen as being hugely skilful, knowledgeable and important in their day but are often poorly represented on Wikipedia. Others were not given the opportunities to be recognised or remembered, with lower class or non-European men being, like women, essentially disenfranchised.</p> <p>This may appear to work against the spirit of the day, but is equally important in terms of appreciating the way science has really operated in history and how it generates knowledge, meaning, agreement and conflict across diverse societies today. For British women, however, it is possible that the most important aspect of the event will not be the making available of a little extra information about women scientists, but the focus on women as Wikipedia editors.</p> <p>The dominance of men in the Wikipedia online community is well-documented and something that the company is attempting to address through its <a href=\"http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Gender_gap\" title=\"\">Gender Gap</a> project. While coming in somewhat ahead of the proportion of female fellows of the Royal Society, in 2009 female Wikipedians were only around <a href=\"http://grouplens.org/system/files/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf\" title=\"\">13% of the active community</a>.</p> <p>Research suggests that this matters for a number of reasons, principally that male and female editors tend to focus on different content areas, that the coverage of topics more likely to be of interest to female users of Wikipedia is seen as inferior, and that Wikipedia is missing out on the successful development of its social and community areas.</p> <p>There is also, particularly around more controversial topics, a tendency to macho behaviour among editors. Women, it turns out, are much less likely to edit articles in these areas and, if they do, their edits are more likely to be rejected. These rejections are often not to do with factual content, but differences in tone and approach.</p> <p>This experience means that these women are very likely to back away from the whole project. In other words, women's voices and views are seriously underrepresented, even when they might consider themselves experts in a particular area.</p> <p>The Royal Society's edit-a-thon will include a range of well-qualified and motivated women with an interest in making themselves, as well as women in the history of science, heard. Wikipedia will certainly benefit from developing an atmosphere that is more welcoming to women like these.</p>",

  "<p>It was on a late September afternoon in 2010 that Frankel first did something extraordinary. It was his third trip to a racecourse, for the Royal Lodge Stakes, and his first to Ascot, where he will return to conclude his brilliant career on Saturday afternoon. Frankel gave some good horses a head start, then chased them down in half a dozen strides on the turn for home and increased his lead all the way to the line to win by 10 lengths. He did not just look good, or even merely exceptional. For the first time, Frankel looked unbeatable.</p> <p>Two years later, he still does. One more victory, in the Qipco Champion Stakes, will&#xa0;complete a perfect 14-race winning streak, and set Frankel alongside the greatest undefeated champions in 300 years of thoroughbred racing. Yet it is a measure of how much he has achieved since that first trip to Ascot that the Royal Lodge, the race that announced his brilliance, is now a relative footnote to the story of his racing life. In a list of Frankel's 13 races arranged according to their power&#xa0;to astonish, it might just sneak into the top six.</p> <p>It is what sets Frankel apart, not only from his contemporaries, but from any horse in living memory, and perhaps in racing history. He is extraordinary on a regular basis. After Bob Beamon jumped 8.90m at the 1968 Olympics, he did not get beyond 8.22m in the remainder of his career. Frankel has done the business over and again.</p> <p>He blew away the best of his generation in the 2,000 Guineas last spring, hammered Canford Cliffs, the best of the older horses, at Goodwood that summer, and finished four lengths clear in the QEII Stakes, the all-aged milers' championship race, in the autumn. This season has been better yet, with victories by five, 11, six and seven lengths, all recorded in Group One events, the highest grade the sport has to offer.</p> <p>Win or lose on Saturday afternoon \u2013 and the betting, as ever, leans strongly towards a win \u2013 Frankel's status as one of racing's greatest champions is already secure. Timeform, a distinguished and independent publisher of racehorse ratings since the late 1940s, made up its mind in June, when Frankel won the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/19/frankel-royal-ascot-queen-anne-stakes2\" title=\"\">Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot by 11 lengths</a>. Only the finest horses record a Timeform rating above 140. Frankel has done so six times.</p> <p>\"We can all remember one brilliant individual performance, or even two or three in the case of Brigadier Gerard [in 1970-72] and maybe Abernant [between 1948 and 1950],\" Jamie Lynch, Timeform's chief correspondent, says, \"but not six, like Frankel. That is what sets him apart from any other horse in history.</p> <p>\"There are seven other individual horses that have run a rating in excess of 140 in our history. Four of those did it once, three did it more than once, but none have done it as many times as Frankel has.</p> <p>\"It's simple physics, really. His closest rivals are Sea Bird and Dancing Brave [winners of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1965 and 1986 respectively], who were best at a mile and a half. Frankel is beating his contemporaries by longer distances at a shorter trip, which takes more doing than it does for horses that weren't winning by so far, at the longer trip. \"</p> <p>There are other ways to measure Frankel in numbers, from the size of his winning streak to the 74.5 lengths that is the sum of his margins of victory, an average of nearly six lengths per race. He has won \u00a32.25m in prize money for his owner, Khalid Abdulla, who also owned Dancing Brave, with another \u00a3737,000 likely to be added to the total on Saturday . And there is the 22 feet that he covers with every stride at top speed, thanks to an elastic action that no opponent can match.</p> <p>Consider, too, that the first prize for the Champion Stakes is around 15 times as much as one major bookmaker took on the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in July in its nationwide estate of 1,600 betting shops. When Frankel raced Canford Cliffs in the same race in 2011, Coral's UK turnover was \u00a3500,000. This season, when Frankel was a 1-20 chance, it was just \u00a350,000, or a little over \u00a330 per shop. Racing is founded on speculation and chance, but Frankel has removed the uncertainty.</p> <p>\"He's just gone beyond betting, which is a reflection of his dominance on the track,\" David Stevens, a Coral spokesman, says. \"In three of his races this summer [at Royal Ascot in June, Goodwood in July and York in August], punters were just not backing against this horse. They knew he was unbeatable, which is unheard of. Normally, there's always someone who thinks the favourite will get beaten.</p> <p>\"He's been a one-off, but for a successful horse, he's not one that has cost the bookies fortunes. It might sound trite when a bookmaker says it, but we really don't want him to be beaten on Saturday, for the sake of the sport, because it would be such an anticlimax. The coverage that he's been getting makes a real difference to racing's profile, and that helps to get people into betting shops too.\"</p> <p>The numbers, though, are scarcely half the story. The punters and racegoers may see little point in putting their money on Frankel at such short odds, but their emotional investment in his success remains immense. Abdulla has horses with eight different trainers in Great Britain, as well as other yards in France, Ireland and America, where Bobby Frankel, after whom the colt is named, trained the Prince's horses for decades. Abdulla chose to send him to Sir Henry Cecil, the most popular and successful British trainer of the past 40 years, and a man who is admired as much for his courage and resilience as for his undisputed brilliance with thoroughbreds.</p> <p>In terms of his background, the blue-blooded Cecil had little in common with Bobby Frankel, a boy from the streets of Brooklyn who started his climb to the top of the sport as a punter at Aqueduct in New York. He died from cancer in November 2009, when the horse named for him was a yearling, and Cecil has been fighting the same disease for six years. It was diagnosed just as his training career was starting to emerge from what had seemed to be a hopeless decline, rooted in personal and professional setbacks including the loss of his twin brother to cancer and the breakup of his second marriage, which kept gossip columnists in copy for weeks.</p> <p>Frankel has restored Cecil to pre-eminence in British racing, though Cecil has been typically modest when discussing his own significance in the story. This week, he paid credit to Shane Fetherstonhaugh, the work rider who has taught Frankel to channel his early exuberance into a ruthless running style, as he observed that \"it could be said that Shane and I train Frankel together\".</p> <p>The real fascination, though, is that even Cecil does not seem to understand the extent of his genius, and what it is that he does so well. \"Everything I do is by instinct,\" Cecil said recently. \"I don't bother about form books and whether a horse beat me one length last time out if I'm running against it again. Well, I feel my horse has improved, and yours may have gone over the top, or was lucky, or at its best. I just do it by feeling, I don't do it by the book. If you actually study horses, their expressions and their mannerisms, then they tell you when they're not right or whether they're well or not.</p> <p>\"I used to ride three lots a day, walk with my horses everywhere, actually gallop with them, and when I had a lot of chemo I couldn't even open a bottle, let alone ride a horse. When I used to ride with horses, it was an advantage, because you could watch them and I'd be able to say 'that filly's coming into season', or 'that colt's not trotting quite as well as it should', so by the time I got to work the horses, I'd be able to change things around. Now, unfortunately I have to go out in the car, so I'm at a disadvantage. But horses do talk to you. Like people, you can see when they're well.\"</p> <p>There is a sense of frailty and uncertainty in Cecil's words with which any of us can identify. His is the human story that allows Frankel to connect with the wider public, and it is as irresistible as Frankel's ground-devouring stride.</p> <p>It will be difficult to let it go too, when the moment arrives on Saturday afternoon and Frankel walks into retirement, hopefully with his perfect winning record still intact. No one in the sell-out crowd of nearly 33,000 at Ascot will expect to see another one like him, even when his sons and daughters start to appear on the track in four years' time. A freak like Frankel is once in a lifetime, and the concentration of genes for speed, strength, athleticism and more that makes him what he is will be slowly diluted over the generations. His name, though, will endure since the final race of Frankel's career does not mark the end of the story, but the start of a new chapter. He will be inked into the pedigrees of thoroughbreds for as long as there is racing. And if it will dispel any sadness as Frankel retires consider this.</p> <p>One day far in the future, after all those who will watch his final race at Ascot are gone, a horse may win a Classic at Epsom or maybe Newmarket, and someone in the grandstand will trace through its pedigree, come upon the name of Frankel and think to themselves: \"Ah, the mighty Frankel. Now there's a horse I'd have loved to see racing.\"</p> <p>We did.</p>",
  "<p>It is hard to know exactly who comes out worst from the ongoing Duncan Jenkins-Jen Chang Twitter-threat-mole farrago, at least in the story as told by Jenkins (n\u00e9 Sean Cummins) <a href=\"http://duncanjenkins.blogspot.co.uk\" title=\"\">on his blog</a>, a version of events that awaits a formal response from Liverpool FC while the club conduct their own investigation. Early leaders in the race to the bottom include Chang; Premier League communication officers everywhere; Cummins himself, who played with the bull and got the horns; plus those old perennially tarnished favourites, modern football, the internet and all human beings everywhere.</p> <p>For those who haven't followed the story, and there cannot be many, Liverpool's director of communications stands accused by the voice behind parody Twitter account Duncan Jenkins of making assorted threats \u2013 including a ban from Anfield and the wrath of putative faeces-wielding Liverpool fans \u2013 over Cummins's alleged leaking over Twitter of information via \"a mole\" within the Liverpool dressing room. Cummins claims not to have a mole and has offered chapter and verse on what, if we are to believe his account, were some frankly rather bizarre dealings with Chang.</p> <p>It is a very modern football story centring as it does on nothing that can sensibly be called football, but instead fraught with the flaring inanities of the periphery. Frankly it's hard to know where to start here, beyond acknowledging that the story as told by Jenkins is in itself a feat of comic self-immolation beyond even NotJenChang or BigJenChang or any one of the many Jen Chang parody accounts that have no doubt already sprung up across this most incontinent of social networks.</p> <p>Really, though, the wider question is how, exactly, the parody Twitter account \u2013 a thing, an entity, a player in itself \u2013 has managed to gain such currency not just around, but now apparently inside, professional football. The Jenkins account remains a rare thing: genuinely funny at times as a step up from the simple parody of a named individual. Instead Jenkins poked fun at an entire genre of person, the blog-dufus football hack with his asymmetric haircut, his smartphone, his intrusive matiness, his almost complete lack of talent. Whereas, pre-Jenkins, the simple one-note parody was already a Twitter staple. Some are reliably funny, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBig_Sam\" title=\"\">fake Big Sam</a>, with its occasionally creative stream of Allardyce-consciousness, or <a href=\"http://topsy.com/twitter/literallyjamie\" title=\"\">Literally Jamie</a>, a slightly cruel Jamie Redknapp parody which is, incidentally, also rumoured to be on its way out.</p> <p>For a while last year there was also a popular Andy Townsend turn, which came the closest, pre-Jenkins, to intersecting uncomfortably with the real world. The Townsend account was eventually pulled by Twitter after newspapers, including the Independent, quoted some of its more risqu\u00e9 tweets as evidence of institutionalised sexism in the TV industry.</p> <p>Beyond this there has long been a subculture of pranks and scams and misinformation, driven by the desire to lampoon both the ambient thirst for footballing gossip and the complicity with which journalists will feed this vice. In the past two years at least two fake football agent feeds have rather sneeringly revealed themselves to be teenagers having a laugh at the expense of tabloid newspapers, where a number of stories \"leaked\" by these bedroom pranksters have ended up making the news pages. Fingers have been burned and this kind of thing is unlikely to transmit itself quite so easily again.</p> <p>And Beyond Twitter's blurted misdirections there are broader successes: most notably the fictional <a href=\"http://www.whoateallthegoals.com/2012/01/masal-bugduv-media-myths-and-anfield.html\" title=\"\">Moldovan 16-year-old Masal Bugduv</a>, a player of rare but also sadly nonexistent genius who managed to find his way into a Times list of the top 50 most promising young players in Europe. Plus, who could forget a number of TV channels and newspapers reporting Liverpool's bid to sign <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/1999/nov/24/newsstory.sport3\" title=\"\">Didier Baptiste</a>, fictional full-back with Harchester United of Sky 1's Dream Team? The list goes on, testimony to the chaotic fecundity of an infinite hunger for football gossip and an infinite space in which to put it, not to mention the multiple deadline pressure under which most newspaper hacks work these days: corners will be cut, mistakes will be made, the tide of information will overwhelm.</p> <p>And perhaps Cummins too must take a little of the blame for the current <em>sui generis</em> shemozzle, which rises up and beyond the simpler parodies that preceded it. If only for the way the Jenkins account began to straddle, uneasily, two opposing genres, no doubt a symptom of his own minor seduction by Twitter-power and journo-heft. It was only when Jenkins began to post \"real\" things about actual transfers, movements within the club, starting lineups \u2013 thereby increasing massively his following and, to a pathetic degree no doubt, his personal wealth via a spoofy internet column \u2013 that the current trouble started.</p> <p>It is easy to portray Chang as someone who simply didn't get the joke. But, to be fair, Chang's beef is not with a parody, but with a parody that stepped out of the shadows, tooled up with a parody-fuelled following, and started having an alarmingly decent punt at actually uncovering some real-world goings-on. This isn't Masal Bugduv lurking always just out of reach \u2013 it's Masal Bugduv suddenly turning up at the club gates doing keep-ups and demanding a trial.</p> <p>On the other hand, nothing Jenkins ever came up with wasn't present elsewhere on the internet. And really it is the structures, the institutional paranoia, the corporate flapping about detailed in his \u2013 as yet unexamined \u2013 account that are far more alarming, if true, than one man's six-month spell of dressing up in a Batman suit at his keyboard. Whatever its resolution, the Chang-Cummins saga is unlikely to inspire future generations to look upon this one and muse, \"truly, they lived though an age of enlightenment ...\"</p> <p>What is beyond dispute is that rumour, speculation and dunder-headed misinformation currently provide an insatiable form of fascination not just around the sport's fevered periphery, a oneupmanship of gossip and lies among those who cling to the coattails of these sporting plcs, but also perhaps among those who report and even control the elite end of the game. Football and the internet make idiots of us all. Strike Duncan Jenkins down and a hundred others will spring up in his place, fallout from a parody of a parody of a parody flushed out into the light in a way that is, in truth, entirely beyond the scope of parody.</p>",
  "<p>When the leaves turn to gold and brown and the pale mist makes islands of the hilltops, and the dark nights start to creep in ever earlier, I always think of Jack Kerouac.</p> <p>Kerouac is, for me, a highly autumnal writer, and I feel the weight of his words most keenly in October. It was a month beloved of Kerouac himself, who wrote at the close of the first act of On the Road, \"I was going home in October. Everybody goes home in October.\"</p> <p>Home, for Jean-Louis Kerouac, was Lowell, a small mill-town in Massachusetts where he was born and where his gravestone has sat, with the message \"He honored life\", since his death in \u2026 October, of course, 21 October 1969.</p> <p>This October seems particularly Kerouackian. Last week saw the release of the long-awaited movie version of his Beat classic On the Road, the unfilmable book <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/14/on-the-road-review\" title=\"\">filmed by Walter Salles</a>. On The Road was famously written in a speed-fuelled haze on a long roll of paper so Kerouac wouldn't have to interrupt his crazy, spontaneous, be-bop prose-poetry by having to put a new sheet into his typewriter: <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/whatson/exhibitions/kerouac/index.html\" title=\"\">the original scroll is on display at the British Library</a> until the end of the year.</p> <p>Jack's hometown <a href=\"http://www.lowellcelebrateskerouac.org/\" title=\"\">celebrates the writer every October</a>, with this year's festivities including a literary festival, the world premiere performance of a Kerouac play, <a href=\"http://www.uml.edu/News/stories/2011-12/Beat-Generation.aspx\" title=\"\">The Beat Generation</a>, and even a 5k road race in his honour.</p> <p>And it's Lowell which surely must have made Kerouac so Octoberish. At the heart of New England, famous for its displays of autumn leaves, it certainly inspired one of his most intriguing works, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jul/08/doctor-sax-jack-kerouac-review\" title=\"\">Doctor Sax</a>, a collision of childhood memories entwined with the imaginary adventures of the titular pulp anti-hero spook of Jack's childhood imaginings.</p> <p>\"In the Fall there were great sere brown sidefields sloping down to the Merrimac all rich with broken pines and browns,\" he writes in Doctor Sax, which is redolent with childhood adventures through the autumn dusk, loitering on the \"wrinkly tar corner\" of his beloved Moody Street.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-87286-380-4\" title=\"\">Book of Dreams</a>, the 1960 collection of his mind's nocturnal wanderings, the only dated entry \u2013 October 14 1953 \u2013 harks back to the Lowell of Doctor Sax, \"where figures stalk cleanly and sharp in soft gloom clouds\u2026\"</p> <p>For all his travelling, Kerouac never let Lowell leave his heart. As a young man in New York in 1941 he swapped letters with his childhood friend (and later brother-in-law) Sebastian Sampas, many of which are printed as back-matter in the \"lost\" Kerouac novel <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-sea-is-my-brother-the-lost-novel-by-jack-kerouac-6268430.html\" title=\"\">The Sea Is My Brother</a>, published by Penguin earlier this year. The letters include excerpts from a play the young Jack began to write called Oktober, featuring a personification of the autumn season and a recurring line \"the end of something old, old, old\" which reappeared in his poem \"I Tell You It Is October\", in the collection <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/kerouac-atop.html\" title=\"\">Atop an Underwood</a>. Editor Dawn M Ward observed: \"To both young men the month of October was in many ways magical, transcendent to the everyday.\"</p> <p>Kerouac never really returned to Lowell, until his funeral on October 24 1969. There's a tale \u2013 apocryphal, I think \u2013 that two old Lowellians watched the procession up to Edson cemetery and one asked the other who had died. \"Jack Kerouac,\" said one. The other shrugged. \"Who's Jack Kerouac?\"</p> <p>Kerouac, of course, was past caring. He was dead and buried, and it was, (to quote the title of one of his beautiful prose-poems) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLj1GwMvh8Y\" title=\"\">October in the Railroad Earth</a>, when \"high in the sky the magic stars ride above the following hotshot freight trains\".</p>",

The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_Act\">Vaccination Acts</a> in the second half of the nineteenth century led to petitions, court cases, a great number of furious newspaper articles, and the odd small riot (for more on this, see<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bodily-Matters-Anti-Vaccination-1853-1907-Perspectives/dp/0822334232\"> Nadja Durbach's <em>Bodily Matters</em></a> or listen to her on BBC Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003c19q\">In Our Time</a>)</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_Diseases_Acts\">Contagious Diseases Acts</a> of the 1860s were just as controversial. Worried about the large amount of military sickness caused by venereal disease (as many as one in three diseased soldiers or sailors had a sexually transmitted infection) the government introduced legislation to allow the arrest, examination, detention and treatment of suspected prostitutes in specific garrison and port towns. Plain clothes policemen were responsible for watching and arresting women; if a policeman swore that the prisoner was a 'common prostitute' she could be forcibly examined for signs of venereal disease, and detained for several months in a specialist 'Lock Hospital' while she was treated. 'Known prostitutes' were also required to register and to have regular follow-up examinations, on pain of imprisonment if they failed to cooperate.</p> <p>These Acts stimulated a concerted, often feminist, counter-reaction which campaigned for their repeal. Reformers such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nightingale_florence.shtml\">Florence Nightingale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/butler_josephine.shtml\">Josephine Butler</a> argued that the Acts were not only unfair (after all, men weren't examined, treated or imprisoned) but in the worst cases amounted to an act of 'instrumental rape', perpetrated through the power of the state and based on the opinion of a single policemen, on women who may have done nothing but be in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p> <p>The compulsory physical examination was certainly brisk and invasive, as gynaecological expert<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Acton\"> William Acton</a> wrote in <a href=\"http://www.victorianlondon.org/disease/venerealdisease.htm\">1870</a> </p> <blockquote> <p>\u2026the examinations are conducted with great rapidity. In the course of one hour and three quarters I assisted in the thorough examination of 58 women with the speculum</p> </blockquote> <p> (that's less than two minutes per woman). Acton saw no problem with these rather one-sided and invasive laws, and thought they ought to be extended to the whole country, because, after all, </p> <blockquote> <p>[h]owever much it may be the duty of the State to leave for settlement to the individual conscience all questions of morals and religion, it can hardly be seriously contended that it is right to abandon to the care of the improvident and profligate the restraining of contagious maladies</p> </blockquote> <p>The arguments against these Acts were successful, and they were suspended in 1883 and repealed in 1886 (many of the records of this campaign are housed at the <a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/thewomenslibrary/\">Women's Library in London</a>, which was recently <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/01/womens-library-rescued-or-abducted\">threatened with closure</a>). But in Cambridge, the detention of women continued because of a special law passed in 1825 which gave the University unusual powers. The Act for the Better Preservation of Peace and Good Order in the Universities of England made the Proctors of both Cambridge and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Police\">Oxford</a> into a kind of private police force. </p> <p>One proctorial duty in Cambridge was to patrol the streets of the town, watching out for women who might be engaging in sexual relationships with students. Once arrested by a Proctor women would be taken to a workhouse called the <a href=\"http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Cambridge/\">Spinning House</a>, and held there until the vice-chancellor himself decided their fate \u2013 to be released or imprisoned for anything up to a few months. There was no legal recourse of appeal for women caught in this system (although, as <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8608049\">Janet Oswald</a> has shown, some may have deliberately sought arrest in the hope of being treated for venereal disease for free). </p> <p>Cambridge's system was an <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/hg/2000/00000026/00000003/art00235\">inspiration for those who supported the Contagious Diseases Act</a>, and it outlived the national legislation. Thousands of women passed through the Spinning House, until one night in 1891 when 17 year-old Daisy Hopkins was apprehended by a Proctor who saw her talking to Mr Russell, a married student. She was sent to the Spinning House and sentenced to 14 days imprisonment, but released after 10 days when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Bench#Court_of_Queen.27s_Bench\">Queens Court Bench</a> ruled that her imprisonment was illegal. (This was on a technicality, as she'd not been properly charged).</p> <p>Hopkins and her friends defended her good name, and she sued the Proctor for \u00a31000 in damages. Public town meetings expressed indignation and anger that the University could wield such unfair power over Cambridge residents, and although Hopkins lost her case (in a trial where her moral character was systematically taken to pieces) her cause attracted a huge amount of supportive media coverage. Even the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50917FC345D17738DDDAC0A94DB405B8285F0D3\">New York Times</a> ran a <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C1EFC345D17738DDDAF0A94DB405B8285F0D3\">couple of columns</a> about the story. This public outcry was too much; in 1894, nearly a decade after the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed, another Act abolished the University's right of 'arrest and expulsion of lewd women', and in 1901 the <a href=\"http://www.cambridge2000.com/cambridge2000/html/0009/P9012319.html\">St Andrews Street Spinning House</a> was demolished (and replaced with a Police Station, now used as Council offices ).</p> <p>(For more, see Philip Howell's <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521853651&amp;ss=fro\"><em>Geographies of Regulation: Policing Prostitution in Nineteenth-Century Britain and the Empire</em></a> Cambridge University Press, 2009)</p>",

The proposals would, according to Ofgem's chief executive, Alistair Buchanan, bring a \"simpler, clearer, fairer and more competitive energy market for all consumers\".</p> <p>The Ofgem proposals come in the same week as a government announcement that energy companies would be obliged to not only inform customers of their lowest tariff but place them on this by default. This proposal was put forward by David Cameron during prime minister's questions on Wednesday, to the surprise of ministers at the Department for Energy and Climate Change.</p> <p>Downing Street was again forced to defend Cameron's confused energy pricing policy on Friday following the Ofgem announcement.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the prime minister claimed that Ofgem's proposals, which would prevent suppliers from offering any more than four primary tariffs for each fuel type, would sit alongside Cameron's stated plans for legislation which could force suppliers to give customers the cheapest deals.</p> <p>\"We welcome the proposals that Ofgem have set out today. Their proposals will help make bills simpler and easier for consumers. This is complementary with what we are trying to achieve. It is really the same agenda.</p> <p>\"We have been working with them for some time on this and will continue to work with them. As the prime minister said, we will use forthcoming legislation to ensure that people get the lowest tariffs,\" she said.</p> <p>Asked whether the government's proposed legislation would override Ofgem's proposals, the spokeswoman replied: \"The energy bill will be published in due course and we will take into account the Ofgem proposals.\"</p> <p>On Thursday the junior energy minister, John Hayes, appeared unable to fully endorse Cameron's proposal <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/18/energy-minister-cameron-hot-air?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">when summoned to the Commons to answer an emergency question</a> on the issue. The government is reportedly under pressure from energy companies to row back from Cameron's proposal, which would significantly restrict competition within the market.</p> <p>Even the seemingly less radical Ofgem proposals would bring significant change to the domestic energy market, which consumers have long complained has evolved into an impenetrable thicket of varying and ever-changing tariff types and confusing bills.</p> <p>The Ofgem proposals, which have been worked on for more than a year, would involve suppliers being obliged to tell householders regularly about the cheapest tariff available to them, and even to switch vulnerable customers, those on fixed-rate deals that have expired or those on a \"dead\" tariff, one no longer available to new consumers.</p> <p>Bills would also be simplified, with tariffs expressed as a standing charge and single unit price and dual-fuel discounts shown separately as a monetary value rather than as a percentage.</p> <p>The plans were \"the most radical reform of the market since competition was introduced\", <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9761000/9761026.stm\" title=\"\">Ian Marlee, of Ofgem, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme</a>. Asked why Ofgem was not pressing for the Cameron approach of moving all customers directly to the cheapest tariff rather than just telling them about it, Marlee argued that such an approach could curb innovations that may benefit householders, such as fixed deals.</p> <p>\"We think that competition is still the best way to protect consumers in the market,\" he said. \"We looked at the whole range of options, but the clear point here is that what we want to do is get an appropriate balance between allowing innovation in the market but making sure there isn't a complicated array of tariffs out there. That's what we think our proposals do.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/press-releases/angela-knight-appointed-chief-executive-of-energy-uk.html\" title=\"\">Angela Knight, the former Tory MP who is chief executive of Energy UK</a>, the industry trade body, said companies felt that directly switching householders to the cheapest tariff could limit choice. \"I think customers do want choice, and that choice is a good thing,\" she said.</p> <p>Even the Ofgem proposals would mark a radical change, she said. \"What we have here is a pretty challenging set of requirements on the companies.\"</p> <p>The energy secretary, Ed Davey, said he welcomed Ofgem's proposals, calling them \"the sort of measures I have been urging for some time\".</p> <p>\"I want an energy market where the suppliers have to work hard to win your business, and then work hard to keep it. Making bills simpler and easier, for instance by actually putting the best tariff on the bill, is a really important part of that.\"</p> <p>However, the shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said the proposals were \"tinkering at the margins\".</p> <p>\"We need to open up the books of the energy companies, but these reforms do nothing to improve the transparency of the prices these firms charge their customers.\"</p> <p>On Thursday night Cameron <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan\" title=\"\">sought to bolster his energy commitments</a> while conceding that his idea was only an option for the forthcoming energy bill.</p> <p>Speaking at the European Union summit in Brussels, the prime minister said: \"We're going to use the forthcoming legislation, the energy bill, coming up this year so that we make sure, we ensure that customers get the lowest tariffs. That's what we're going to do.\"</p>",

Her intervention in the debate comes a week after a similar attack on statutory press controls <a href=\"http://www.newspapersoc.org.uk/11/oct/12/ns-director-highlights-dangers-of-statutory-press-controls-to-freedom-of-expression\">by the NS director David Newell.</a> </p> <p>You have to hand it to the NS. These guys know how to campaign. Behind the scenes, they lobby hard. In public, they know the value of drip-drip-drip propaganda. You would expect nothing less from such an efficient newspaper body. </p> <p>In Rasaiah they have an excellent media lawyer, one of the most knowledgeable in the field in this country and a terrific advocate for press freedom. I haven't the least doubt that her views - and those of the NS - are shared by virtually all the journalists who work on local weeklies and regional dailies.</p> <h2>Why end independence of the press?</h2> <p>Similarly, I imagine that the vast majority of national newspaper editorial staff agree with this rhetorical question from Rasaiah: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Why end the hard-won independence of press from state, turn back to concepts of state controls abandoned three centuries ago, if the UK's laws and courts already provide appropriate actions, forum and redress against offending press behaviour?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, for those of us who think a dab of statute may be necessary (in my case, very, very reluctantly indeed), that question must be answered head on.</p> <p>Everyone believes in \"the freedom of the press\". It has become a mantra since 1695, when the licensing order of 1643 was allowed to lapse. And it was shouted louder still when stamp duties came to an end in 1855, heralding the launch of a populist press.</p> <p>It is certainly true to say that various British laws - libel, for example, but plenty of others - make our press less free than that of the United States.</p> <p>Then we made it a little less free when we created, first, the Press Council and then, in 1991, the Press Complaints Commission with its ethical code of practice.</p> <p>American journalists always look askance at the PCC, asking why it should have been necessary at all? Were our laws not good enough (or bad enough) already? </p> <p>The explanation, of course, is that our centralised, highly competitive national press with a rambunctious, raucous tabloid component is very different from the regionalised, largely uncompetitive and stolid US press.</p> <p>Let's be honest: the only reason we created press self-regulation in the first place was because of consistent misbehaviour by the popular papers. </p> <h2>Did the PCC really eradicate misdemeanours?</h2> <p>This was conceded during the Leveson inquiry by none other than Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre and the Sunday Times investigative reporter Mazher Mahmood.</p> <p>At the pre-inquiry seminar, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8823511/Phone-hacking-Daily-Mail-chief-Paul-Dacres-speech-in-full-to-Leveson-inquiry.html\">Dacre spoke of \"outrageous\" behaviour in the past:</a> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It was not uncommon for reporters to steal photographs from homes. Blatant subterfuge was commonly used. There were no restraints on invasions of privacy. Harassment was the rule rather than the exception.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And Mahmood, <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Witness-Statement-of-Mazher-Mamood.pdf\">in a witness statement to Leveson,</a> spoke of \"unethical practices such as reporters entering hospitals pretending to be relatives of a patient to get a story.\"</p> <p>Both men sought to suggest that the PCC had been responsible for eradicating all such misdemeanours. And I do not deny that from the PCC's inception, along with the introduction of the editors' code, a great deal of cavalier misconduct was curbed.</p> <p>But the weight of evidence presented to Leveson graphically illustrated that the self-regulatory regime had not sufficiently changed tabloid newsroom culture to prevent a string of abuses. </p> <p>Aside from hacking, the inquiry heard of other intrusions into privacy. We learned of the routine use of private investigators to obtain confidential information, of people being put under surveillance and of \"blagging\" by reporters. </p> <p>Moreover, journalists spoke of bullying, and of being pressured to write prejudiced and/or inaccurate articles. Anyone who has worked for a tabloid knows that editors and executives rule the roost. You do what they say or you don't stay in the job.</p> <h2>What laws exist to stop all reporting abuses?</h2> <p>There is nothing on the statute book to prevent that happening, nothing to stop reporters from being required to misbehave. That's one major reason that the PCC and the code failed (and why a conscience clause with appropriate safeguards for those who invoke it is required).</p> <p>What law would we cite against the journalist who slipped a note into the school bag of JK Rowling's five-year-old daughter? What law would prevent a news editor telling a reporter to offer disproportionate sums of money to people to tell tales? </p> <p>Where on the statute book would we find a law specific enough to terminate the tradition of \"blagging\"? Though there are laws to prevent stalking, at what point in a newspaper's surveillance of an individual would the police step in?</p> <p>These problems, and others like them, are best dealt with through a regulatory system. I believe (unlike many critics) that the PCC did get to grips with some excesses and, in general, performed well, given its remit and its powers.</p> <p>But those powers were too limited. It gave more pre-publication advice than many people, including many journalists, realise. And that prevented the publication of many a story. </p> <p>It could not investigate and its inquiries lacked penetration. Take hacking as an example. There cannot be any doubt that News International lied to the PCC (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/07/leveson-inquiry-harding-mohan-buscombe-live\">as its former chair, Peta Buscombe, has said</a>). It is also obvious that the company also lied to MPs on the select committee.</p> <p>The responses from each of them to these lies were very different. The PCC accepted News International's response at face value and then <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NjAyOA==\">took a gratuitous swipe at The Guardian for good measure.</a></p> <p>By contrast, the select committee's report, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/feb/24/phone-hacking-scandal-mps-verdicts\">citing the \"collective amnesia\" of witnesses from the News of the World,</a> was altogether more sceptical.</p> <p>It said it was \"inconceivable\" that no one else at the paper aside from the royal editor Clive Goodman knew about the extent of hacking at the paper. And it poured scorn on the \"unwillingness\" of News International \"to provide the detailed information that we sought.\"</p> <p>This robust verdict reinforced the perception of the PCC as being weak. Worse, however, was the regime before Buscombe's, when hacking was first revealed. It accepted News International's denials and failed to interview the editor, Andy Coulson, when he resigned <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2007/jan/31/coulsonresignationconcealsn\">in circumstances I revealed in January 2007</a>. </p> <h2>Why did the PCC not investigate hacking?</h2> <p>Did no-one at the PCC not think it strange that the court case involved not only the hacking of the royal princes, but the Professional Footballers Association chairman Gordon Taylor, Simon Hughes MP, Elle MacPherson, Max Clifford and Sky Andrew?</p> <p>Did that not alert the PCC to the fact that Goodman was not the only News of the World staffer involved? Did it pursue that issue with the News of the World?</p> <p>The wider point here is that such acceptances undermined the PCC's credibility. I am willing to take on board the fact that the <em>perception </em>of it being an industry fig leaf did not always match the <em>reality</em>. That goes with the territory for all industry regulators.</p> <p>I also tend to believe that the PCC's standing might not have mattered had hacking not happened. But it did. That may be unfortunate and unfair. But it's how it is.</p> <p>So the only way to ensure that the public can have confidence in a reformed PCC is to give it some kind of statutory underpinning on the lines <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-by-Professor-Roy-Greenslade-of-City-University.pdf\">I suggested in my evidence to Leveson</a> (as did others).</p> <p>It grieved me to come to that point. Members of the British Journalism Board know that I struggled to the last to avoid coming to the statutory conclusion. </p> <p>I am concerned how about how such a plan might be implemented. I am worried about the effects on all journalism. I am sorry for those thousands of innocent journalists whom Rasaiah speaks for. After all, it isn't their fault.</p> <p>I just hope that if the set-up of a new regulatory regime is done sensibly, it will not inhibit their freedom to inform and entertain their readers in future.</p>",
  "<p>The police have come in for criticism over their attempt to move the women's legal action into an opaque, little-known tribunal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/16/lovers-undercover-officers-sue-police\" title=\"\">The group of eight women is seeking</a> to take legal action against police chiefs as they say <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/16/undercover-police-officers-lives-women?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">they were duped into forming long-term</a> relationships with police spies.</p> <p>They want to have the case heard in a civil court at the High Court.</p> <p>But the Metropolitan Police is attempting to get the case moved into the <a href=\"http://www.ipt-uk.com/\" title=\"\">Investigatory Powers Tribunal</a>.</p> <p>Many will see this as a cynical move by the police to hide this in a closed court.</p> <p>The point here is that the tribunal is not like the High Court.

So if they lose, they are not told why. The tribunal also says \"there is currently no avenue to appeal the decision\" of the tribunal in the UK.</p> <p>See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/02/metropolitan-police-spy-cases-tribunal?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">this here</a> for criticism from the women's lawyer, Harriet Wistrich, and this from the <a href=\"http://bristlingbadger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/expanding-injustice.html\" title=\"\">Bristling Badger blog</a>.</p> <p>There has also been criticism from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/carolinelucas\" title=\"\">Caroline Lucas</a>, the Green MP, who told <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120613/halltext/120613h0001.htm#12061355000002\" title=\"\">Parliament that the move </a>would \"prevent the women, whose privacy was invaded in the most intrusive manner imaginable, from hearing the evidence, such as the extent to which intimate moments were reported back to police chiefs.

  "<p>At some point this year, somewhere in the US, a teenage girl will decide she wants to have sex. She might not know when, or who with, but she has made that choice. Unfortunately for her, this is a turbulent and uncertain year to be making sexual and reproductive health choices in the US.</p> <p>If a student, she might have been relieved when Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Affordable Care Act</a> passed in June, knowing she can access student health plans that provide free contraception. She may already be benefiting from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/PreventTeenPreg.htm\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Initiative</a> launched by Obama in 2010, which funds school sex education programmes that show evidence of success, those predominantly promoting contraception over abstinence.</p> <p>But this is an election year and early in 2012 voters got an idea of what to expect from the Republicans' presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, when he challenged contraceptive coverage included in the health reforms. Along with many Republicans, Romney supported an amendment that would exempt employers with moral objections from including contraception in employees' health plans. Though the amendment failed, Romney promised to not only \"undo\" the contraceptive mandate but to repeal the entire act on his first day in office.</p> <p>\"They could starve it financially, cripple it even if they can't repeal entirely,\" explains Adam Sonfield, of the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guttmacher Institute</a>, which specialises in sexual and reproductive health and rights. \"There are lots of opportunities to do damage.\"</p> <p>Whatever the route, his point is clear: as president, Romney will do all he can to ensure federal money isn't spent providing contraceptives.</p> <p>Voters could be forgiven for thinking Romney is less clear on abortion. When running for Senate in 1994 he said he believed \"abortions should be safe and legal in this country\". Now he wants <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roe v Wade</a>, the court decision that legalised abortion nationally, overturned and would make further substantial cuts to reproductive health services, despite a federal ban on funding abortion.</p> <p>\"Republican and independent-leaning women may believe Romney is the man he said he was in 1994, but he's not,\" says Emilie Ailts, director of campaign group <a href=\"http://www.prochoicecolorado.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado</a>. \"If he gets to the White House he will defund Planned Parenthood.\"</p> <p>Whereas pro-choice Obama refused to bow down to Republican <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/government-shutdown-sticking-point-planned-parenthood/story?id=13328560\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">threats in 2011 to shut down government</a> unless funding was cut to <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planned Parenthood</a>, Romney promises the opposite. Underscoring this is Romney's VP running mate, Paul Ryan. A fiscal conservative driven by pro-life ideology, Ryan co-sponsored a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/11/paul-ryan-personhood_n_1767760.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">federal measure to ban abortion in all cases</a> and is consistent with his position.</p> <p>\"Ryan practices what Romney preaches: Romney has pledged to 'get rid of Planned Parenthood'; Ryan voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood. Romney said he would end the Title X program that funds birth control and cancer screenings; Ryan voted to eliminate Title X,\" says Ailts.</p> <p>The Guttmacher Institute estimates the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Title X family planning programme</a> is used by 25% of poor women wanting to obtain contraceptives and is vital to reduce unintended pregnancies. Obama wants more funding for this programme but Romney wants it axed and would also cut the widely used Medicaid programme through which low income women receive reproductive healthcare.</p> <p>Programmes promoting safe sex among young people could also be at risk under Romney, who supports sex education based on abstinence until marriage and funded such programmes when governor of Massachusetts. According to Douglas Kirby, senior research scientist at health and education research non-profit <a href=\"http://www.etr.org/home\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">ETR Associates</a>, Obama's pregnancy initiative is likely to reduce unprotected sex. The opposite could happen if the focus returns to abstinence.</p> <p>\"Because abstinence programs are generally less effective at reducing sexual risk, if they are promoted instead of comprehensive programs, more young people will probably engage in unprotected sex and teen pregnancy and STI rates will be a little higher than they otherwise would be,\" says Kirby.</p> <p>On some youth reproductive health policies, the candidates stand closer together. Last year, going against scientific advice, Obama restricted giving emergency contraception over-the-counter to under 17-year-olds unless they had a doctor's prescription. As a father of two daughters the decision to him was \"common sense\". Romney vetoed emergency contraceptive legislation in Massachusetts because it \"disregarded the importance of parental involvement\". Neither helps young girls wanting to discreetly access the morning-after pill.</p> <p>Overwhelmingly though, Romney would cause bigger problems for reproductive rights in the US and internationally. He promises to reinstate the \"<a href=\"http://www.genderhealth.org/the_issues/us_foreign_policy/global_gag_rule/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Gag rule</a>\", a policy that prohibits international organisations receiving US funds from providing any abortion-related care. The rule, rescinded by Obama on his second day, has been an early act of every new party president since introduced in 1984 and has big repercussions.</p> <p>Improving access to reproductive services is key to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">millennium development goal 5</a> \u2013 the target to improve maternal health. With this target lagging, there is a pressing urgency to ensure it is at the top of the agenda as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">discussions begin on future development goals</a>.</p> <p>As a member of the UN, the US will contribute to negotiations about the post-2015 development agenda, which will steer a course for future sustainable development. But in contrast to Obama, a Romney administration is unlikely to recognise that a lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services only worsens cycles of poverty \u2013 at home and abroad.</p>",
  "<p>The internet is a medium of choice for millions of people who seek health-related information. In addition to websites presenting ostensive medical facts, thousands of virtual support groups have sprung up for those suffering from particular illnesses. Whether formatted as chatrooms, as newsgroups or in other ways, they offer patients and families the chance to share their hopes, fears and knowledge with others experiencing life as they are.</p> <p>These online groups can counter isolation and serve as bastions of understanding, deep concern and even affection. But despite the apparent intimacy of many health support groups, individuals sometimes choose to mislead others by pretending to have illnesses they do not have \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/dave-on-wheels-hoax-parapalegic-blogger-david-rose-elaborate-fraud_n_1968454.html\" title=\"\">latest high-profile case of which surfaced this week</a> after \"David Rose\", a prolific paraplegic blogger, was exposed as a hoax.</p> <p>The eventual discovery of these online deceptions can be devastating. As I was alerted to such cases by people who had attended my lectures on \"real-life\" Munchausen syndrome <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/nov/28/healthandwellbeing.health3\" title=\"\">12 years ago</a>, I dubbed this phenomenon \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/26/faking-illness-online-munchausen\" title=\"\">Munchausen by internet</a>\". This term has gone viral as the number of recognised cases has exploded.</p> <p>For decades, physicians have known about this so-called factitious disorder. Afflicted people will wilfully feign, exaggerate or self-induce illness to command attention, obtain lenience, act out anger or control others. Though feeling entirely well, they may bound into hospitals, crying out or clutching their chests with dramatic flair. Once admitted, they send the staff on one medical goosechase after another. If suspicions are raised or the ruse is uncovered, they quickly move on to a new hospital, town or even country. Like travelling performers, they simply play their roles again.</p> <p>I coined the term \"Munchausen by internet\" to refer to people who simplify this process by carrying out their deceptions online, and it appears, because of its ease, to be much more common than its real-life progenitor. Instead of seeking care at hospitals, these pretenders gain new audiences merely by clicking from one support group to another. Under the guise of illness, they can also join multiple groups simultaneously. Using different names and accounts, they can even sign on to one group as a stricken patient, his frantic mother and his distraught son \u2013 \"sockpuppets\" designed to make the ruse utterly convincing. Each of these characters may have a bogus Facebook account or exploit other social networks such as Twitter.</p> <p>Based on more than 100 cases of Munchausen by internet shared with me via <a href=\"http://www.munchausen.com\" title=\"\">my Munchausen website</a>, I have arrived at a list of clues to the detection of false internet illness claims that I first developed for the Southern Medical Journal. The most important are:</p> <p>1. The posts consistently duplicate material in other posts, in books or on health-related websites.</p> <p>2. The characteristics of the supposed illness emerge as caricatures.</p> <p>3. Near-fatal bouts of illness alternate with miraculous recoveries.</p> <p>4. The claims are fantastic, contradicted by subsequent posts or flatly disproved.</p> <p>5. There are continual dramatic events in the person's life, especially when other group members have become the focus of attention.</p> <p>6. There is feigned blitheness about crises that will predictably attract immediate attention.</p> <p>7. Others apparently posting on behalf of the patient (eg family members, friends) have identical patterns of writing.</p> <p>The most important lesson is that, while most people visiting virtual support groups are honest, everyone must balance empathy with circumspection. One should be especially careful about basing their personal healthcare decisions on uncorroborated information supplied on the internet. When Munchausen by internet seems likely, it is best to have a small number of established members gently, empathically and privately question the author of the dubious posts. Even though the typical response is passionate denial regardless of the strength of the evidence, the author will typically eventually disappear from the group. Remaining members may need to enlist help in processing their feelings, ending any bickering or blaming and refocusing the group on its original laudable goal.</p>",
  "<p>Midway through the post-show Q&amp;A I was hosting at the West Yorkshire Playhouse on Tuesday night \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/series/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-at-west-yorkshire-playhouse\" title=\"\">part of our ongoing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof project</a> \u2013 a hand near the front shot up. What did all of us think, a gentleman near the front politely enquired, of the idea of tweeting during shows? Was it really on?</p> <p>It's a fine question \u2013 and one already seized on by a tweeter. On Thursday, <a href=\"http://adamzed.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Adam Zed, who blogs at Pikchures</a> (he's also a rather good photographer), wrote a thoughtful post about the event, ruminating on the strange urge many Twitter users feel to post reactions as quickly as possible, to avoid being \"last second's news\". The obvious follow-on, he felt, was dangerous: theatregoers would surely start tweeting during the performance itself, thereby ruining it for everyone else. He also raised an interesting point: who are all these tweets really aimed at, if not at people who are there too? <a href=\"http://adamzed.tumblr.com/post/33770271396/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-guardian-twitter-night\" title=\"\">Shouldn't we just all be having, you know, a conversation in the bar</a>?</p> <p>This chimed with something discussed at length by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/we-happy-two-jamie-parker-and-tom-hiddleston-tackle-shakespeares-henry-v-7956970.html\" title=\"\">actor Jamie Parker</a>, who was playing Brick in the production and joined us afterwards on the panel. He talked at length \u2013 and, I thought, fascinatingly \u2013 about the nature of the live experience: its addictive pull for actors, the near-primal experience of being in a room with an audience, the strange chimerical power of the theatrical event. I'm not sure I totally bought his story about the first ever Hamlet, <a href=\"http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/burbage002.html\" title=\"\">Richard Burbage</a>, whose death scene was apparently so convincing that audiences thought he'd died on stage (<a href=\"http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=hamlet&amp;Act=2&amp;Scene=2&amp;Scope=scene\" title=\"\">though Hamlet claims something curiously similar about the power of drama</a>). But, hey \u2013 Parker cut his teeth among the groundlings at Shakespeare's Globe, so perhaps he has access to other forces. And it's hard to imagine the live experience being anything like as immersive with half the audience bathed in the ghostly glow of their phones, tweeting or messaging away in the murk rather than following what's happening on stage.</p> <p>As the LA Times reported earlier this year, some US theatres have <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/12/theaters-tweet-seats-twitter.html\" title=\"\">attempted to take matters into their own hands by setting up so-called \"tweet seats\"</a>, specifically created to let their occupants tweet as they go, while keeping them safely away from people wanting to watch the show undisturbed. Part of me wonders if it's an attempt to dragoon in younger audiences; all of me wonders how many people bother to tweet if they're actually engaging with the show.</p> <p>What's certainly true is that theatre, if it's to work, requires a kind of complicity between performers and audiences: call it <a href=\"http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/biographia.html\" title=\"\">willing suspension of disbelief</a>, call it simply willingness to pay attention. But the moment you check out and start concentrating on something else \u2013 your rumbling stomach, the train journey home, what you're going to put in 140 characters \u2013 you're lost. Personally I can't imagine wanting to tweet during a live performance, for all that I might feel the urge afterwards, and want to carry on the conversation online. <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/04/more-than-attention-must-be-paid-salesman-set-record-ticket-price/\" title=\"\">As a playwright once wrote</a>, attention must be paid. He could have added: save those tweets for later.</p>",
  "<h2>Welcome to the mobile wallet gold rush</h2> <p>There has been an explosion in mobile wallet launches and announcements over the past 18 months that shows no sign of abating as online players, network operators, financial institutions, retailers and more battle for position, in partnerships or as a solo play. Mobile wallets stand at the intersection of payments, retail and advertising and the opportunities this presents are creating a lot of excitement. Mobile wallets are also a rich source of customer and transaction data that is a revenue-generating asset in its own right. Service providers can leverage this data for advertising purposes and to better position and personalize mobile wallet value-added services. There is clearly a lot up for grabs, and it is little wonder that so many players want a controlling stake in the mobile wallet value chain, as the winning service providers will be in a position of considerable power.</p> <h2>Beware of the bandwagon effect </h2> <p>The buzz is blinding many to the fact that mobile wallets are challenging propositions that are difficult to get right. The hype is also encouraging certain companies to take an opportunistic approach and attach the mobile wallet label to services that are nothing of the kind. The foundation of a mobile wallet is support for proximity mobile payments and monetary/value accounts of some kind. But this is just the starting point for a mobile wallet service, which in our definition goes beyond a core mobile cash account and instead act as a container for a range of complementary applications integrated with the core payment service. There is also an increasing focus on combining proximity payments with remote payments.</p> <p>Mobile wallets should be strongly branded and designed from the ground up. They are complex propositions that bring together a wide range of functions, service and support elements. For a service provider, there are a lot of moving parts to manage, many of which will be outside of their core competencies.</p> <h2>Customer data \u2013 both goldmine and minefield</h2> <p>Mobile wallets have the potential to generate an unprecedented flow of detailed customer data, but service providers must be extremely careful in how they leverage this. Service providers will have to manage consumer concern about how their data is used and shared, along with its vulnerability to privacy and security breaches. There is also the contested question of who controls the data as it originates from a number of sources. For example, financial service providers are the traditional guardians of consumer financial information, operators have access to detailed mobile specific consumer demographic and behavioral data, merchants have access to purchase history and loyalty scheme data. Ideally these various data sources need to be aggregated and cross referenced to yield maximum value, but no player wants to relinquish ownership or control.</p> <h2>Will consumers want one or many?</h2> <p>There is a great deal of uncertainty over the extent to which consumers will accept and trust mobile payments in general, which in turn affects the chances of mobile wallets becoming a mass market proposition. A fundamental issue here is convincing consumers that mobile payments are secure and provide greater value and convenience than existing ways to pay for things.</p> <p>Presuming that consumers can be persuaded that mobile payments are the way forward, there is still the question of how many mobile wallet services can thrive and survive in the longer term.</p> <p>At the moment we are witnessing a proliferation of mobile wallets, but clearly the market cannot support an infinite number. Consumers are in danger of becoming overwhelmed by choice or confused, particularly as most mobile wallets offer similar services and include many of the same credit card payment networks. It can be even more bewildering for a consumer when network operators offer individual mobile wallet services, but then also pitch services to them in partnerships with other operators. This is particularly pronounced in the UK. Associated with this is the question of whether consumers will want multiple wallets \u2013 in other words will they consolidate their loyalty and spending with one mobile wallet or adopt several, given that they can, in theory, all be accommodated on their phone. We think the most likely scenario is that consumers will gravitate to one or perhaps two mobile wallet services.</p> <h2>Merchant still take a cautious stance on mobile payments</h2> <p>Although merchants are more aware of the potential benefits of mobile payments, the reality is that that, outside of a few key players such as Starbucks, the majority are still sitting on the fence. They are concerned about security, the investments requirement to upgrade point of sale (POS) and back-office systems to support near field communication (NFC) and the fact that the installed NFC devices have not yet reached critical mass and consumer usage of mobile payments in still low. There are also some additional factors specific to mobile wallets that are giving merchants cause to pause. Mobile advertising is seen as a core part of a mobile wallet proposition and one that is potentially appealing to merchants. But supporting mobile advertising may require additional investment. For example, POS terminals will need to be capable of processing mobile coupon redemptions and discounts in the same scenario as handling payments, whereas today it is typically a separate process.</p> <h2>The monetisation challenge</h2> <p>The business model for mobile wallets remains challenging. There are fundamental questions over how substantial revenues can be when the size of most mobile wallet transactions is small and where the margins can be seriously eroded by revenue share agreements between parties, or by costs incurred in transaction processing fees when payments are related to credit or debit cards. Service providers are also looking to drive revenues from complementary value-added-service applications. But, given that consumers are unwilling to pay much for applications, it is doubtful that revenues will be significant, although value-added-services do generate value in indirect ways such as increased engagement and loyalty. Mobile advertising is also being woven into the mobile wallet revenue mix and, although promising, it will be hard to execute.</p> <h2>Time for a sanity check </h2> <p>Mobile wallets present some compelling opportunities, but the excitement is also generating a lot of hype and clouding the fact that mobile wallets are difficult to execute well and have serious obstacles to overcome before they can become mass market. Unless the industry becomes more aware of exactly what is at stake \u2013 and acts on it \u2013 then the longed-for scenario where people leave their traditional purses at home in favor of mobile wallets will never happen.</p> <p>This opinion piece is based on some of the key findings from Ovum's new report, <a href=\"http://ovum.com/research/mobile-wallets-unwrapped\" title=\"\">Mobile Wallets Unwrapped</a>.</p> <p><em>Eden Zoller is Principal Analyst at </em><a href=\"http://ovum.com/section/home/\" title=\"\"><em>Ovum</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>Exhibition of the week: Art from the Margins </h2> <p>The French artist <a href=\"http://www.dubuffet.com\" title=\"\">Jean Dubuffet</a> was not only a highly original painter, but a reclaimer of lost voices and liberator of silenced communities. <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/what-to-see/museums-and-galleries/pallant-house-gallery\" title=\"\">This fascinating season</a> of art at Pallant House juxtaposes an <a href=\"http://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/forthcoming/main-galleries/art-from-the-margins/art-from-the-margins/jean-dubuffet-transitions\" title=\"\">exhibition of Dubuffet's work</a> with art by marginalised groups in British society. Dubuffet \u2013 with his idea of \"art brut\", or raw art \u2013 argued that true beauty is found in the art of children, or the art of those that society calls insane, rather than the insipid art of the establishment. As part of this season, a radical perspective on Britain today is offered by <a href=\"http://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/forthcoming/main-galleries/art-from-the-margins/art-from-the-margins/outside-in-national\" title=\"\">Outside In: National</a>, a show of 80 works by people working outside the mainstream.</p> <p><a href=\"http://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/forthcoming/main-galleries/art-from-the-margins/art-from-the-margins\" title=\"\">Pallant House</a>, Chichester, from 20 October until 3 February 2013</p> <h2>Other exhibitions this week</h2> <p><a href=\"http://barber.org.uk/in-front-of-nature/\" title=\"\">Thomas Fearnley</a><br>Powerful Norwegian landscape painter of the Romantic age.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/what-to-see/museums-and-galleries/the-barber-institute-of-fine-arts\" title=\"\">Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a>, Birmingham, until 27 January 2013</p> <p><strong>David Shrigley</strong><br>Metaphysical wit who straddles art galleries and cartooning.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.cornerhouse.org/\" title=\"\">Cornerhouse</a>, Manchester, until 6 January 2013</p> <p><a href=\"http://blincdigital.com/\" title=\"\">Blinc</a><br>A festival of digital art against the unlikely setting of Conwy Castle.<br>\u2022 Conwy LL32, 27-28 October</p> <p><strong>Rothko/Sugimoto</strong><br>Dark insights from a great painter and an eerie photographer.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.pacegallery.com/london/exhibitions/11142/rothko-sugimoto-dark-paintings-and-seascapes\" title=\"\">Pace Gallery</a>, London W1S, until 17 November</p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398022699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/18/1350576170147/Nicolas-Poussin-010.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolas Poussin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from Nymph with Satyrs (c1627), oil on canvas.

  "<p>Is local government ready to let go? Chief executives and senior managers gathering in Coventry this week for the annual <a href=\"http://www.solace.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Society of Local Authority Chief Executives</a> (Solace) conference were attempting nothing less than to redefine the role of councils for an austere, digital and networked world.</p> <p>The message that emerged was we must surrender control and embrace collaboration. The dress code was strictly hair shirt. Delegates checked into cheap hotels where the reception desk doubled as a bar and there was one iron for 100 rooms.</p> <p>At this year's conference, I detected a widespread belief that the era of direct service provision was giving way to councils harnessing the \"energy and assets\" of local people. Historically dubious claims that we are experiencing a time of unprecedented scale and pace of change have given rise to worries that councils risk sidelining long-term planning in the face of perpetual short-term crises. Others simply fear that authorities are poorly equipped to shape or harness this new world.</p> <p>Behaviour has to change. There needs to be a shared vision for an area, built collectively with everyone from colleges to businesses to police commissioners. Building new homes, matching skills to jobs, encouraging sustainable energy, providing the infrastructure for growth, tackling isolation among older people \u2013 local government is crucial to everything, but it can't do anything alone.</p> <p>In an era of low trust in politicians, councils need to embrace openness and transparency and find ways to unleash the power of digital engagement. Risk management \u2013 and a willingness to take more risks \u2013 needs to become a routine skill.</p> <p>The delegates confronted some difficult issues. Do members and officers have the ability to deliver the scale and pace of change needed? Are councillors ready to trade their leadership position for the role of catalyst? The skills of chief executives themselves came under question: can officers who developed their careers in organisations based on hierarchies and direct power adapt to leading in a world of networks and collaboration?</p> <p>The local government lexicon is taking on the appearance of a Google corporate strategy paper. The new world will require \"open source contestibility\", inviting communities to offer their own solutions then providing the funding and support to make it happen.</p> <p>There were some difficult truths to grasp about local government's relations with private companies, both as suppliers and as the source of local economic growth. Outsourcing firms are beginning to lose patience with big schemes that collapse before the deal is signed.</p> <p>Edinburgh's <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e8677a74-4386-11e1-9f28-00144feab49a.html\" title=\"\">decision to shelve a scheme</a> at the last minute was a bad sign. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/tory-leader-cornwall-council-privatisation\" title=\"\">spectacular implosion of Cornwall county council's leadership</a> this week \u2013 possibly the only time a webcast of a council meeting has trended on Twitter \u2013 jeopardises another big contract.</p> <p>Northumberland has abandoned preparations for a tender. Bids for big contracts cost each firm perhaps \u00a32-4m. If they begin to think local government is too high-risk, one of the major routes to achieving savings will start to suffer from higher prices and a reduced choice of suppliers.</p> <p>As sources of economic growth, chief executives were forced to face up to the fact that many of their councils know very little about their major local employers and what they could do to support them, and are far less helpful to local entrepreneurs than they would like to think. With companies increasingly mobile, such weak relationships and service risks losing firms.</p> <p>But, despite all this, there was palpable optimism. While the NHS is quaking under the pressure of \"flat cash\", chief executives seem unfazed by losing almost a third of their grant. They are reminiscent of the knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail, who, after having had all four limbs sliced off, shouts \"it's only a flesh wound\".</p> <p>There was almost a feeling of liberation. A small cut in funding just means trimming and contracting, while a big cut opens up new ways of thinking and working. Curiously, the government was barely mentioned; no-one was waiting for a plan for growth or for education secretary Michael Gove to give them permission to work with academies \u2013 they were just doing it.</p> <p>But everyone understood that people in their communities were getting hurt. Food banks \u2013 the index of desperation in austerity Britain \u2013 were cited as evidence of the way poverty was permeating both working-class and middle-class areas. The most difficult question is how we stop the most vulnerable falling through the networked safety net.</p> <p><em>Richard Vize is a commentator on public policy and management.

  "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is for those watching Hunted on BBC1. Please do not read on if you haven't seen episode three</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/11/hunted-series-one-episode-two\" title=\"\">Julia Raeside's episode two blog</a></p> <p>We are now three-eighths of the way into this fun-house mirror maze so it is much easier just to keep going than try and find your way back to the start. Come on, I'll give you a cuddle when things get confusing/brain-pickling/too far-fetched.</p> <p>If you've been watching Hunted for the last three weeks, you might be having a bit of trouble with your eyes. It's the endless, chilly, uninterrupted grey. If it's not night time, it's overcast, or wintry; like being permanently trapped under a pigeon's wing. I can't see the grey now without wanting to grab the nearest person to me, shove them against a wall and hiss wildly into their ear: \"Who sent you?\"</p> <h2>MI6</h2> <p>This episode was the greyest yet with the introduction of the MI6 characters. God, their offices are miserable. Section chief George (we don't know his last name yet) spends his days shut in a windowless cell with grey walls, grey floor and one pot plant. And that's probably going to get binned when his superiors find out he's been trying to jazz things up. He keeps his special spy reports in a grey filing cabinet although how he finds it against the grey walls I don't know. Presumably this is because computers are less secure than an unlocked 1980s filing cabinet stuffed full of biro-covered A4.</p> <p>His pulchritudinous agent, Natalie, is busy investigating Byzantium via the conduit of Aiden. And more specifically, Aiden's manly rude bits. They check into a completely grey hotel for their regular sex meetings but this time he tells her it might be risky, having nooky with an MI6 operative when they're after dirt on his own employers. Duh. (See also: plot holes).</p> <h2>Hourglass</h2> <p>So now we know the name of the shady organisation (another one??!) that wants Sam Hunter dead. Oh, like in the opening titles! Apart from the fact they have their own divider in George's cabinet, we know little else. Presumably Blank Face Man (no sign of him this week) works for Hourglass and will return in a future episode.</p> <h2>Hat watch</h2> <p>It was quite the week for Sam's almost indistinguishable collection of drab hats. When she went in to comfort Eddie after his nightmare, she had on her head a knitted representation of grief. It was no colour that you would find on the Dulux chart: it just hung there like fog, or a haunted pillowcase. But it was all-change when she joined the family for their trip to the hotel in the country. Yes, the hat was grey but it was also a beret! I expect she wore that one in Tangier when she was trying to convince her terrorist boyfriend she was French.</p> <h2>Memorable moments</h2> <p>This week it's all about the boot. You know the one. Faulks and Zoe are in the car, driving away from the docks after witnessing Turner's hoods burning Hassan's body. Then Faulks plonks a black Dr Marten on the dashboard and says he has managed to retrieve one of Hassan's boots from the fire. Why? Then Zoe points out that Hassan didn't wear boots. Surely people generally, throughout their lives, depending on the weather, wear a combination of shoes and boots. It's not something you swear off, is it? Like not eating shellfish. \"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't wear boots.\" This is more insane than the milk business from episode one. Keep a note of these clues \u2013 pasteurised milk, a boot \u2013 they are clearly important.</p> <h2>Plot holes</h2> <p>\u2022 Everyone continues to have secret spy conversations either in glass lifts or in front of enormous panoramic windows. At least Sam has finally pulled down the blind in the secret hidden room in her flat. Now she can stick pictures of her enemies to her big revenge collage in relative privacy.</p> <p>\u2022 They also realise everything too late. Aiden's thought process when shagging Natalie was clearly: \"Ooh, pretty lady spy. Let's have intercourse.\" Then, weeks later it suddenly hits him: \"Hang on, she works for the special secret bit of the government who might not like how we go around killing people and so on. I'd better stop seeing her. Just one more sex before I do though.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Limburg, the ill-fated Norwegian who signs Turner's bid paperwork and then gets bumped off, must go down as this week's most stupid character. He goes to meet the baddy he suspects of murdering his colleague, in the dead of night, by a secluded lake. On his own.</p> <h2>The Mole</h2> <p>This week it was Zoe's turn to passive-aggressively confront Aiden about the mole issue. \"Keel says we have a mole,\" she says, studying his face intently for give-away twitches. \"Thoughts?\" she adds , using all the skills she learned from her Fisher Price My First Spy Kit. Can someone please just ask him: \"Are you the mole, Aiden?\" Because clearly the other way isn't working.</p> <h2>Lines of the week</h2> <p>\u2022 Big up to Zoe for this bit of exposition-drenched nonsense: \"We've got a problem. You know the tracking device that I planted on that case that Turner gave to Dave Ryder? I've lost the signal.\" That's on a par with the fascinating witches who put the scintillating stitches in the britches of the boys who put the powder on the noses on the faces of the ladies of the harem <a href=\"http://bettylou.zzruss.com/courtofkingcaractacus.htm\" title=\"\">of the court of King Caractacus</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Aiden, panicking that Sam's cover has been blown: \"We need to get her out of there. Now.\" He says this at least once an episode.</p> <h2>Next time</h2> <p>\u2022 Aiden tells Sam Jack's going to kill him and she replies in her best Kylie-posh: \"I can harndle it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Aiden's mental ex, Natalie, turns up at Byzantium as their MI6 liaison officer. Is that a thing? \"Hi, I'm here (I'm not here) to secretly liaise (you haven't seen me, right?) with you and keep an eye on what you're up to. (I'm not.)\"</p> <p>\u2022 Faulks is offered a job by Dave Ryder after proving himself worthy by sleeping overnight in a lap-dancing club. Is that the gangland equivalent of staying in a haunted house to prove you're not scared?</p> <p>\u2022 Aiden asks a random woman: \"Do you know anything about Hourglass?\" \"What's Hourglass?\" \"That's what I need you to tell me.\"</p> <p>So what <em>is</em> Hourglass? I'm hoping it's literally a big, walking egg-timer in a monocle and bowler hat. Leave your thoughts below</p>",
  "<p>The call for reform started in Jordan well before the Arab spring. However, it has intensified since \u2013 not only because of the Arab revolutions, but also in response to widespread state corruption. Jordan's reformers are demanding constitutional changes; in particular, changes to our election law so that a truly representative parliament is possible, together with an elected prime minister who is accountable to parliament.</p> <p>The national demonstrations that took place earlier this month exposed the attitude of Jordanian officials toward reform. The demonstration was organised by the Muslim Brotherhood together with more than 70 independent initiatives. The announcement that the opposition was to hold a peaceful demonstration was met with a concerted campaign to disrupt it. The media even reported that radioactive pollution was present in the area of the demonstration. Various officials prepared a counter demonstration under the title \"Loyalty to the King\" in the same place, and at the same time.</p> <p>However, the demonstration went ahead \u2013 the largest in the country's history \u2013 putting Jordan on the path of true reform. What is most striking is that this large attendance was drawn from all parts of the country \u2013 cities, villages, Bedouin centres and refugee camps \u2013 and included many women. The official response had been designed to instil fear; it failed. Many in Jordan now speak of this demonstration as the beginning of the Jordanian spring.</p> <p>Just days after the demonstration, the newly appointed prime minister, Abdullah Al-Nsour, declared there were to be no changes to the election law, a key reform demand. This did little to relieve the tension. Just as 2011 witnessed the formation of four different governments in Jordan, so this year will end with at least three governments, with the dissolution of two parliaments before the end of their terms \u2013 a clear indication of political instability. The regime has no clear exit plan from this crisis.</p> <p>The need for reform is clear, but the regime does not want to accept it. This is obvious, not only in the way it dealt with the demonstration, but also in its dealings with its own representatives. The king had said he would be the guarantor of the findings of the Committee of National Dialogue which was formed and headed by Tahir al-Masri, the head of the appointed upper house of parliament. But instead the king insisted on the electoral law that was issued by the <a href=\"http://www.gid.gov.jo/en/home.html\" title=\"\">General Intelligence</a>, not that which was issued by the committee. Those who participated in this committee were betrayed, as was the prime minster at the time, Awn Al-Khasawneh, who resigned refusing to allow the passage of laws formulated by the intelligence services.</p> <p>The opposition is now faced with the choice of remaining in the street, or entering the elections. We have chosen to remain in the streets until genuine reform is achieved \u2013 the forthcoming elections have been manipulated even before they begin, and will be directed by a committee headed by Abdul Ilah al-Khateeb, a former minister in the government that forged the 2007 elections.</p> <p>Our regime is good at talking about reform. As for reform itself, it still has a long way to go. The Arab spring was used to spread fear among the people. The regime continues to scare the west, too, pointing to the rise of the Islamists after the rise of the Arab spring.</p> <p>The fact that Bashar al-Assad continues in office, despite his savagery, has also given a boost to Jordan's repressive regime. And having seen that the world does not call to account Assad, we in the Jordanian opposition have deep doubts about the true intentions of the American and British troops who were reported to be on Jordanian soil. They claim they are providing \"protection to Jordan from Syrian spillover\", but we oppose any foreign troops on our land, and consider this a clear violation of Jordanian sovereignty.</p> <p>In Jordan, the regime has not shed blood; it pursues a strategy of \"clean repression\". Regrettably, the victory of Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections was used as an excuse to forge the Jordanian elections in 2007. That was not a one-off: the Palestinian intifada was also used as an excuse to suspend parliamentary life for two years, during which time the government issued 200 temporary laws in the absence of a parliament. Today the Arab spring is used as an excuse to delay, rather than accelerate, reform.</p> <p>Even so, in the absence of bloodshed there is still hope. In our monarchical system, reform is possible, and we have a history of reform that we can build upon. In the 1950s, a constitution was enacted and a parliamentary government was formed. In 1989, the Islamic Movement participated as a partner in the government and led a programme of democratic transformation.</p> <p>The monarchical system is able to benefit from global experience \u2013 most notably, perhaps, that of King Juan Carlos and the transition to democracy in Spain. Ironically, the late King Hussein Bin Talal said in 1989 that he wanted to do as his friend, Juan Carlos, had done, but democratic transformation was aborted because of external factors, among them the Gulf war and the Wadi Araba Treaty with Israel. We hope that this time reform will be realised with transition to a genuine constitutional monarchy. The decision is still in the hands of the king, who today holds absolute power.</p>",
  "<p>Police in Cambridgeshire have said they are investigating complaints made after the leader of the far-right British National party, Nick Griffin, posted the address of a gay couple on the internet and appeared to urge his supporters to demonstrate outside their home.</p> <p>Michael Black, 64, and John Morgan, 59, a couple from Brampton, Cambridgeshire, had found out earlier on Thursday that they had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/christian-gay-couple-ordered-pay-damages\" title=\"\">won their highly-publicised civil case against a Christian bed and breakfast owner</a> who had told them they could not stay in one of her double rooms due to her religious convictions.</p> <p>Black, a writer and exams consultant, had told the Guardian he and his partner were delighted by the ruling from Reading crown court, which found that Susanne Wilkinson, owner of the Swiss Bed and Breakfast in Cookham, Berkshire, had been directly discriminatory in her treatment of the couple. She was ordered to pay \u00a33,600 in damages, which Black and Morgan \u2013 who have been living together for six years and in a relationship for nine \u2013 said they would donate to charity.</p> <p>But within hours of celebrations at what was seen as a significant vindication of equality legislation, gay rights activists were outraged by several messages on Twitter by Griffin, chairman of the BNP and an MEP, in which he made public Black and Morgan's address and claimed a \"British Justice team\" would come and protest the ruling at their home.</p> <p>The first messages read: \"If anyone can give us address of the 2 bullying 'gay' activists who've won case v Christian B&amp;B owners, we'll hold demo \u2026 for rights of all home owners, gays included, to rent or not rent rooms to whomsoever they wish.\"</p> <p>Two hours later, Griffin posted the following tweet: \"A British Justice team will come up to [their Huntington address] &amp; give you [Black and Morgan] a \u2026 bit of drama by way of reminding you that an English couple's home is their castle. Say No to heterophobia!\"</p> <p>The comments sparked anger. LGBT Labour, the party's campaign for gay rights, urged people to report Griffin for allegedly breaching the Communications Act 2003, under which it is an offence to post menacing messages on the internet. Others said they had reported his comments to the Metropolitan police's internet hate crime unit.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Cambridgeshire police said it was looking into \"a number of complaints\" it had received about the tweets. Officers had been in contact with the men and would visit them on Thursday night, she said. A spokesman for Stonewall, the gay rights campaign group, said: \"This is beyond words unbelievably shocking. It is a real example of the hatred still out there towards gay people. We assume the couple concerned will make immediate contact with the police to guarantee their safety.\"</p> <p>Griffin then wrote: \"Why don't left &amp; gay activists confront Muslims instead of picking on meek &amp; forgiving Christians? Bullies are always cowards!\"</p> <p>Twitter users trying to access Griffin's account were subsequently told it had been suspended.</p> <p>Black and Morgan, a computer consultant, had spoken of how their treatment at the Cookham B&amp;B in March 2010 had made them feel \"like second-class citizens\". But Black said he hoped their victory would serve as proof that discrimination against any minority was no longer permissible. \"We're doing this to try and make sure that all B&amp;B owners realise what the law is and think twice before discriminating against gay people, black people, Christians, Muslims, Irish, any other group.\"</p> <p>Asked how he had reacted to being refused access to the B&amp;B, Black said: \"It felt as if we were being treated like second-class citizens. I was shocked that it had happened. If it had happened 30 or 40 years ago it would have been far less surprising because discrimination was much more overt and common then. But for it to happen nowadays was a shock. I think the great public support we received as a result of it shows that we were right to be shocked \u2013 that it's only a minority, a small minority, who feel that gay men and women are sinners and that they can't allow us to sleep under their roof.\"</p> <p>In the ruling, Recorder Claire Moulder said that, although the court recognised the sincerity of Wilkinson's religious beliefs, the owner had treated Black and Morgan \"less favourably than she would treat unmarried heterosexual couples in the same circumstances\" and had therefore broken equality law.</p> <p>Wilkinson \u2013 whose legal defence was paid for by the Christian Institute, a national charity \u2013 said she was giving \"serious consideration\" to an appeal against the ruling.</p> <p>\"Naturally, my husband and I are disappointed to have lost the case and to have been ordered to pay \u00a33,600 in damages for injury to feelings. We have the option to appeal, and we will give that serious consideration.

  "<p>After writing six historical novels in a row, with my latest novel <em>Dominion</em> I have fulfilled a long-held ambition and written an alternate history novel, a \"what-if\". I remember, as a history student in the 70s, reading Len Deighton's novel <em>SS-GB</em>, an alternate history in which Germany has successfully invaded Britain in 1940 and the country is divided between resisters and collaborators. Its imagining of a defeated Britain rife with spies stuck with me, and I became a fan of second world war alternate history novels, especially Robert Harris's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099571575/fatherland\" title=\"\"><em>Fatherland</em></a>, which I think is the best.</p> <p>Most such novels imagine a successful invasion of Britain, but my own reading convinced me that, militarily, Germany's planned 1940 invasion could not have succeeded, given Britain's control of the air and the sea. So I turned to another option, which very nearly happened \u2013 Neville Chamberlain being succeeded as prime minister in 1940 not by Winston Churchill but by fellow-appeaser Lord Halifax. Most of the Conservative Party, Chamberlain himself, and the King, wanted Halifax, not Churchill, to lead the proposed new coalition government, and the Labour Party left it to the Conservatives to decide. Halifax's doubts about his ability to be a war leader gave Churchill the post. If Halifax had assumed the position I think he would have made peace after Dunkirk; he certainly argued for doing so then. The terms would have been Britain keeping her empire and leaving Germany a free hand in Europe. I think, as Churchill did, that had this happened Britain would inevitably have ended up as a German satellite.</p> <p>In <em>Dominion</em>, rigged elections have, by 1952, brought an increasingly authoritarian Britain run by Lord Beaverbrook and Oswald Mosley, while the growing strength \u2013 and violent actions \u2013 of the British Resistance, led by Churchill and Attlee, have led to the government allowing an expanded Special Branch and Auxiliary Police force to crack down ferociously on dissent, with the Gestapo in the background, while Germany increasingly presses Britain to deport its Jews for \"resettlement in the East\".</p> <p><em>Dominion</em> is a book about resisters and collaborators. The resisters are not all shining heroes. Nor are the collaborators all monsters. Some are motivated by fanatical nationalism, others are venal, but others are pacifists, while everyone fears threats not just to themselves but their families. The book's central character, David, is a civil servant secretly supplying information to the resistance. But he is full of conflict \u2013 over his part-Jewish background, which he has kept secret even from his wife Sarah, and over the dangers his activities could place her in. Sarah comes from a family of pacifists, some of whom are now collaborators, and the way she, and they, react to developing events is a major theme of the book.</p> <p>David is sent on a dangerous mission and he and a group of fellow-resisters are pursued across a shabby, frightened Britain by a relentless Gestapo agent, Gunther Hoth. With Gunther I have tried showing something different to a stock Nazi, and he has some of the features of the classic modern detective \u2013 he is shambling and awkward, with a disastrous personal life, but also a brilliant and intrepid detective and hunter of \u2013 in his eyes \u2013 wrongdoers. He has an unshakeable moral compass. Unfortunately this is Nazism, and he is capable of its most appalling acts. But how a decent enough young German became a slave to Hitler's ideas is also part of the tale.</p> <p>In writing my historical novels I have always tried to be as accurate as possible in conveying the world of the story. That is a hard task, but in <em>Dominion</em> there was the additional challenge that my 1950s never actually existed. I had to think through the developments I thought would have taken place in Britain after surrender \u2013 political, social, cultural. For example TV, which had just got started before the war closed it down, returns in 1940 not 1945, is more widespread and under increasing government control. There was no blitz, no Attlee government or welfare state. The world I have created is, I hope, recognisably the early 50s, but warped and twisted and impoverished, its worst aspects exaggerated.</p> <p>In the wider world of the story America, after Britain's surrender, did a deal with the Japanese and retreated into isolation. All Europe is under Germany's heel, and with Britain gone from the field Hitler invaded Russia earlier and with more troops. However, unlike in some alternate history novels, the Third Reich is not triumphant. Hitler's Russian war has gone on for 11 years, sucking the resources of Germany and all Europe into the limitless territories of the Soviet Union. Hitler's Parkinson's Disease has left him a disabled recluse. Riven with internal conflict, the Nazi regime is on the edge of collapse. I always thought the whole Nazi enterprise was far more fragile than many think.</p> <p>Why write this novel now? The main reason was that, having written four Tudor novels in a row I badly needed a break from Henry VIII's England. But also, during the last two years as I wrote the book, the evils of politics based on race and nationalism \u2013 its dominant theme \u2013 came to the fore again in Europe as economic crisis gripped the continent and many people responded, as they had in the 30s, by turning to nationalist solutions. I find the free-market ideology that has dominated the world for the past 30 years, and brought us to our present ruin, a dogma that has failed repeatedly and disastrously, but politics based on national identity is even more dangerous; anti-rational, demagogic, assuming individuals should be defined by their nationality, and, always, against an enemy.</p> <p>Tragically, and unlike in the 1930s, nationalisms are on the rise in Britain as elsewhere in Europe, with Ukip and, north of the border, the Scottish National Party. In <em>Dominion</em> I have gone to town on the SNP's opposition to actively fighting fascism, which was also true in the real world. I make no apology for using the book to stress how I see the SNP, for all the moderate face it currently presents, as deeply dangerous, with no politics in the conventional sense, believing only in the old dream that the unleashing of \"national spirit\" and \"national pride\" can solve a country's problems.</p>",
  "<p>Once, we had doctor knows best, and teacher knows best. That's changed, but in the civil service, apparently we still have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/09/hasten-death-deference-civil-service?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">your boss knows best</a>.</p> <p>It can hardly be a surprise to anyone that the civil service is both hierarchical and bureaucratic and in places rather formal. Of course the civil service covers a diverse range of services, but according to insiders, the culture is one of deferring to authority. As such it is out of step not only with general attitudes to authority in society but also with current management thinking.</p> <p>This centres on the value of engaging with staff, explaining the thinking behind proposals and encouraging staff to comment and make suggestions. Some are encouraging the civil service to \"loosen up\" as part of a much-needed cultural change.</p> <p>I am not so sure. My background is in social services, which is the hip end of local government. Social services have always been more informal than many other services, probably due to the fact that most senior managers are former social workers, who like to think, perhaps as part of helping vulnerable and disadvantaged people, that they are a little bit anti-establishment.</p> <p>When I started my career in social services senior people were referred to by their title rather than their name, as in: \"the director is looking for you\". Now, of course, everyone is referred to by their first name, even if you have never met them.</p> <p>Other things have changed, too. When I became an assistant director, I had my own reserved parking space and an office that not only had a view but that was also big enough to accommodate a large conference table.</p> <p>Before long, however, these status symbols were done away with. As we wanted to be seen as more accessible, senior managers moved into an open plan office on the ground floor. PAs were replaced by shared admin support. I queued up at the photocopier with everyone else and we made each other coffee and tea.</p> <p>We regularly toured the department speaking to large open staff meetings where people were encouraged to ask \"any question\". We made extensive use of social networking, not just through a directors' blog but by setting up discussion groups around topics like sexual harassment, homophobic bullying and racism. We particularly wanted to engage with middle managers. The top 50 managers met the senior management team once a month and the aim was to develop a shared vision for the department and an agreed set of priorities.</p> <p>Previously, when the director had announced new initiatives, managers tended to nod in agreement. Expressing concerns or asking too many questions would have been considered disruptive, unhelpful, even disloyal.</p> <p>But opening up the debate on social networks and in large staff meetings did not always produce the required result. It provided a forum for cynics, and due to inexperience, some people expressed themselves inappropriately. A lack of confidence meant others remained silent.</p> <p>Senior managers had to become skilful facilitators, careful not to stifle the debate but prepared to be challenging and to be publicly challenged. Is the civil service ready for this level of lack of deference?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.blairmcpherson.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Blair McPherson is author of </em></a><a href=\"http://www.blairmcpherson.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>UnLearning management</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

  "<p>David Cameron launched a belated attempt to firm up his widely criticised commitment to oblige all energy companies to provide customers with the lowest tariff.</p> <p>But amid claims from opposition MPs and consumer groups that his plan was unworkable, the prime minister was forced to admit he had only raised an option for inclusion in the energy bill. He said he was considering requiring energy companies to put some direct debit customers on low tariffs with a customer's right to opt out.</p> <p>Attending the EU summit in Brussels, Cameron tried to counter claims his policy had unravelled, saying: \"I want to be on the side of hard-pressed, hard-working families who often struggle to pay energy bills. That's what I said in the House of Commons yesterday. We're going to use the forthcoming legislation, the energy bill, coming up this year so that we make sure, we ensure that customers get the lowest tariffs. That's what we're going to do.\"</p> <p>A Downing Street source said: \"This is very big. Energy prices is one of the biggest issues on the doorstep and we are determined to do something.\" The source insisted the discussions had been going on for weeks, and was not something the prime minister said on the spur of the moment. Details would be set out in the forthcoming energy bill.</p> <p>One of the options being examined is that people who are on a variable tariff and pay by direct debit could be informed by their provider that they were going to be automatically switched to the lowest variable direct debit tariff from the same provider. People would be able to opt out of automatic switching if they wanted to. Number 10 said this would make the system more transparent and promote competition between the companies to offer the cheapest tariffs.</p> <p>It emerged that neither energy companies, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, or Cameron's advisers had been forewarned he was going to make his pledge on Wednesday at prime minister's questions.</p> <p>He told MPs: \"We will be legislating so energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers.\"</p> <p>Asked on Thursday whether the prime minister's pledge meant energy companies would only be able to offer one tariff \u2013 the cheapest \u2013 Davey said: \"[Ensuring] consumers face the lowest bills possible is a priority for me. We have been in discussions across government. Ofgem has been talking about fewer tariffs and simpler bills and that is the direction of travel.\"</p> <p>Neil Bentley, deputy director general of the CBI, which is urging the government to end its feud over energy policy and back the green economy, said: \"We are seeking policy clarity like everybody else. If competition is to work, consumers have to have a choice of tariffs. I'm not quite sure where the prime minister was coming from.\" Labour said the proposal was unworkable given the complexity of current tariff structures.</p> <p>The prime minister's announcement was the first example since the Tory conference of Cameron making good on his commitment to be on the side of the \"strivers\". He had promised to back strivers against vested interests such as energy companies, territory that Ed Miliband has sought to colonise. The episode has left energy companies, with billions of investment at stake, scrambling to discover Cameron's true intentions.</p> <p>The energy minister, John Hayes, revealed the level of ministerial ingnorance in an emergency statement to MPs in which he would only commit to getting people lower tariffs through \"different options to be considered\". He added: \"While the number of companies has shrunk, the number of tariffs has simultaneously grown by something like 400-fold. That is not sensible.\" Much of his studiously vague statement was greeted with laughter by MPs.</p> <p>Hayes suggested the government was looking to see if the voluntary agreement announced in April with energy firms should be made binding in legislation. That agreement required firms to tell customers of lower tariffs, but not to put them on the tariff automatically.</p> <p>The prime minister's spokeswoman said the government would \"oblige companies to offer the lowest price to many consumers\". This stopped short of the blanket guarantee that energy companies would be forced to give all consumers the lowest prices \u2013 the measure apparently proposed by Cameron. She said ministers were looking at a variety of options. At its most minimal Cameron will now have to put a statutory obligation on energy companies to send a letter to customers setting out the lowest tariffs available to specific customers.</p> <p>Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said: \"We all mis-speak from time to time, and the prime minister was under a lot of pressure yesterday, but for the government to spend a day pretending to have a policy that they have no intention of implementing is no way to run a country. It is like something out of The Thick of It.\"</p> <p>Andy Atkins, Friends of the Earth executive director, said: \"Cash-strapped households will continue to struggle with rising fuel bills while our energy system remains hooked on increasingly costly gas. Government must protect people from rising gas prices by helping people to insulate heat leaking homes.\"</p> <p>Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said: \"This is yet another major embarrassment for a government so bereft of ideas that it has fallen to making up nonsensical, evidence-free policy on the hoof.\"</p>",
  "<p>A few years ago, AM Homes, still probably best known for her upmarket paedophile shocker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781862078901/the-end-of-alice\" title=\"\"><em>The End of Alice</em></a>, took an unexpected swerve into feel-good territory. Up until 2006, she was mainly a purveyor of suburban gothic: she adopted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cheever\" title=\"\">John Cheever</a>'s Westchester as her fictional terrain, but where the great short story writer gave the wealthy New York suburb an undercurrent of dread and misery, Homes turned it into a horror film. <em>The End of Alice</em> \u2013 pretentious, humourless, and horribly overwritten in a cod-Nabokov style \u2013 is actually far from her best in this vein; the short stories and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781862078895/music-for-torching\" title=\"\"><em>Music for Torching</em></a>, her 2003 novel about yuppie parents run amok, are a much better bet. In this period, Homes was often compared to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/breteastonellis\" title=\"\">Bret Easton Ellis</a> \u2013 cynical and sensationalistic, certainly, but also clearly very talented.</p> <p>Then, surprisingly, came her last novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\" title=\"\"><em>This Book Will Save Your Life</em></a>, an LA-set story about a rich, isolated man who suffers a physical crisis and goes on a wild compassion spree: he buys a homeless man doughnuts; he takes in an unhappy housewife and a stray dog; he rescues a woman from the boot of a kidnapper's car. It had the same sense of spiritual emptiness as the earlier books (none too subtly, a sinkhole opens up in the hero's garden) but moved decisively in the direction of redemption. The book received a bumpy critical reception, but became a kind of cult success. Both reactions were understandable: it was kitschy and bordered on the inane, but there was something appealing about its mixture of the apocalyptic and the perkily upbeat, caught nicely by John Waters when he said: \"If Oprah went insane, this might be her favourite book.\"</p> <p>Homes's new novel starts in the style of <em>Music for Torching</em>, then veers off in the direction of <em>This Book Will Save Your Life</em>. The first section is a tour-de-force of pitch-black comedy set, again, in Westchester. The story begins at Thanksgiving: Harry Silver, an under-achieving Nixon scholar, describes his hatred for his taller, richer, more aggressive brother George, a TV network boss, who sits \"at the head of the big table, picking turkey out of his teeth, talking about himself\". George's children, aged 10 and 11, are \"sat like lumps at the table, hunched, or more like curled, as if poured into their chairs, truly spineless, eyes focused on their small screens, the only thing in motion their thumbs \u2013 one texting friends no one had ever seen and the other killing digitised terrorists\". Harry is picking the stuffing out of the \"heirloom\" turkey carcass in the kitchen, his lips smeared with grease, when his sister-in-law Jane suddenly kisses him on the lips.</p> <p>A few months later George is arrested. He has run a red light and smashed into a people carrier, killing a couple and leaving their son orphaned; it's not clear that it was an accident. Then, in startlingly quick succession, all sorts of bad things happen: an affair, a murder, a divorce; and Harry suddenly finds himself in sole charge of his niece and nephew. After the first exhilarating 50 pages, the reader wonders: where on earth can Homes go now?</p> <p>The answer seems to be: everywhere. The rest of the book is a digital-age picaresque, a series of bizarre, episodic adventures. People are hospitalised, repeatedly; sacked, kidnapped, and incarcerated in sinister experimental correctional facilities. There is child abuse, abuse of prescription drugs, internet sex, and a swingers' party at a Laser Tag Emporium. There are subplots to do with a murdered woman, a Bar Mitzvah in a South African village, and the discovery that Richard Nixon wrote dark short stories. The overall direction of travel, though, is towards the light. The children, says Harry, push him into being \"a better version of myself\", and an alternative family unit forms under his supervision. Dark satire gives way to spiritual uplift.</p> <p>At the fulcrum between the dark and light is a vision of an atomised, alienated society elaborated in what is clearly the novel's keynote speech: \"There is a world out there, so new, so random and dissociated that it puts us all in danger. We talk online, we 'friend' each other when we don't know who we are really talking to \u2013 we fuck strangers. We mistake almost anything for a relationship, a community of sorts, and yet, when we are with our families, in our communities, we are clueless, we short-circuit and immediately dive back into the digitised version \u2026\" The \"loss of the human touch\" in everyday life is a recurring theme; towards the end, Harry is told: \"You're human now.\"</p> <p>This movement from irony to sincerity is a very characteristic one in young-ish American writers. You also see it in <em>The Simpsons</em>, and in indie films such as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449059/\" title=\"\"><em>Little Miss Sunshine</em></a>, where satire gives way to a warm alternative community. It's difficult to do well: darkness and despair often present themselves in more aesthetically pleasing forms than kindness and optimism. And<em> May We Be Forgiven</em> is a very uneven novel, rickety, meandering and repetitive. There are far too many forgettable sub-plots and similar comic routines. Its recipe for redemption, as in <em>This Book Will Save Your Life</em>, involves an uneasy mixture of truism (be nice to children, animals, strangers) and kitsch (form friendships with immigrants who work at fast food outlets, listen to the wise medicine man). It is, however, often very funny, in a bad-taste way. Homes's dialogue drives a lot of the action \u2013 and she's very good at dehumanising sales patter, and smart, classic Hollywood-style rat-a-tat-tat exchanges. Some of the half-ironic, half-sincere set-pieces, such as Harry's visit to his nephew's ridiculously well-appointed private school, are excellent. And the novel is consistently interesting in more sombre ways, too, as when Harry discusses the \"rusty sense of disgust\" that he suspects might be his soul. <em>May We Be Forgiven </em>is a semi-serious, semi-effective, semi-brilliant novel which could not be called, overall, an artistic success. But you'd have to have no sense of the absurd, and no sense of humour, not to be pretty impressed.</p>",
  "<p>Meeting rooms of the Palace of Westminster can be disconcerting places in which to give speeches. This week, Alok Sharma MP hosted the launch event of a new report from the Institute of Physics on <a href=\"http://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2012/page_58712.html\">The Importance of Physics to the UK Economy</a>. As soon as IoP president-elect Frances Saunders began her reply to his welcome, the division bell rang deafeningly for several minutes. When she finally managed to restart, a background rumble from some elderly men in the corner, hitting on the free wine, provided a distracting backdrop. I was told they were Lords, which seems too clich\u00e9d to really be true.</p> <p>The report itself is full of information about, as the name suggests, the importance of physics to the UK economy. It kicks off (footnote one, executive summary) by defining \"physics-based sectors\" of the economy as those where \"the use of physics - in terms of technologies and expertise - is critical to their existence. i.e. if there was no physics, these sectors would not exist.\" </p> <p>It is clear from this that the report was not actually written by physicists, who would of course claim that physics is critical to the existence of everything since without it the Earth wouldn't go round the Sun, the atoms of your body would not hang together, and of course nothing would have mass. Still, the list of nearly a hundred industries and sectors given in the appendix, ranging from \"Extraction of crude petroleum\" to \"Repair of communication equipment\" seems a pretty reasonable delineation of the part of the economy that would quickly be in trouble if the UK stopped doing physics research and education.</p> <p>There are some impressive numbers. The direct contribution to the UK's economic output is \u00a377 billion, or 8.5%. This rises to more than \u00a3220 billion if you include indirect spend. 3.9m jobs are supported by these industries in the wider economy, with the average worker in a physics-based industry adding a factor of two more \"gross value\" than the average worker overall. It's not, to be honest, the main reason I do physics, but it is one reason that we should, as a nation. And I'm glad someone writes these numbers down, because unless we know these things, physics may cease to exist. At least in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398029128\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Science/contributors/2012/10/18/1350594646843/iopoi.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Flint, CEO Oxford Instruments\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Flint, CEO of Oxford Instruments, holds the floor.

But since Oxford Instruments mostly supplies companies that are doing high technology research themselves, it may be a worry that a diminishing fraction of this is being done in the UK.</p> <p>At least two of the attendees at the event were ex-students of mine. Gratifying though that was, I was beginning to feel a bit too senior at that stage and was quite glad of the presence of those may-be-Lords to remind me that I wasn't yet that far gone. Coincidentally, earlier in the day two of my current students - one of whom had initially taken physics because he wanted to work in banking - had been asking me for tips on physics-based careers. We need them.</p> <p>In a comment after my last article I was accused of being part of a slick PR machine for particle physics. I'm trying to be flattered by that, but to be honest I see myself as a scientist, a physicist and a particle physicist in that order of importance. And I'm a PR person, or advocate, some way further down the list. Anyhow, I'm glad the IoP have some of this covered.</p>",

Founded by former Channel 4 and Vodafone executives in 2006, Tesco acquired a majority 80% stake in April 2011.</p> <p><strong>Set-up </strong>Registration is simple, and you can choose to store your payment details rather than input them every time you want to rent or buy a movie. I trialled the service using a computer hooked up to my TV via a Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter.</p> <p><strong>Navigation </strong>Intuitive and simple, with an obvious split between movies and TV; but as with many such sites its \"movies like this\" function disappoints, often suggesting wildly different or inappropriate titles to the one selected. Its search facility is disappointing, requiring you to type a full title rather than single words (\"American-Werewolf-London\", for example, brought back no results, whereas \"An American Werewolf in London\" did).</p> <p><strong>Price</strong> Films can either be rented, purchased or both (TV programmes tend to be purchase only, for example). Rentals are available to watch for 30 days but expire 48 hours after you begin to watch them. New-release movies are \u00a33.49 to rent or \u00a310.99 to buy, while older film rentals range from 99p to \u00a32.49.</p> <p>A big plus point is blinkbox offers more than 1,000 free films, and they're not all duds. In just a couple of minutes I spotted A Bittersweet Life, The Lost Boys, Dark Star, Sliding Doors, award-winning short films, documentaries and all manner of interesting curios and B-movies. This is a great way to trial the service and test the quality, although they do have \"ad breaks\" throughout which can irritate \u2013 especially as the adverts are two minutes long and you cannot fast-forward through them.</p> <p><strong>Deals </strong>It's worth keeping an eye on Tesco \u2013 it runs regular special offers (one recent offer was a \"meal deal\", where people buying certain products in-store could rent a movie for \u00a32). Vouchercodes.co.uk had a 10%-off code for the film Rock of Ages. It's probably worth checking a few voucher sites every now and again just in case there's an offer.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong> Very good, especially on films. The latest releases include Prometheus, ill Manors, Snow White and the Huntsman, The Hunger Games, Marvel Avengers Assemble, and Wrath of the Titans.</p> <p>The choice of TV shows is also impressive, with popular series such as Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones and Homeland all on offer, including the first episode of Homeland's second series, only shown on UK television in early October 2012.</p> <p><strong>Quality of streaming/download</strong> Some movies looked a little ropey when blown up to full size on a computer or on my TV, and the service lacks an HD option.</p> <p><strong>Verdict </strong>7/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/\" title=\"iTunes website\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>What is it? </strong>Software that, as well as allowing users to play, download, store and organise music (across people's computers, iPods, iPads and iPhones), also lets them purchase or rent on-demand films and TV programmes. It was introduced by Apple in 2001 and is available as a free download.</p> <p><strong>Set-up </strong>If you haven't already got an Apple ID, it's straightforward to set one up. Download iTunes itself from the Apple Store menu and click on \"Create account\". You'll be up and running within minutes. I trialled the service using a computer as well as via Apple TV, linked to a Samsung flatscreen TV.</p> <p><strong>Navigation </strong>Superior to blinkbox. On a computer, scroll-bars on the homepage allow you to flick through a large number of titles in the new releases category, as well as themed categories such as \"Action men\" or \"The Tim Burton Collection\"; while best selling titles are also obvious.</p> <p>A pull-down menu allows you to easily find films in more conventional genres (romance, sci-fi etc), while iTunes also offers more eclectic groupings such as \"Capers &amp; heists\" and \"All things geek\").</p> <p>The search facility is more comprehensive and intuitive than blinkbox, although its positioning is a little confusing (using iTunes on a computer), as it appears above the main iTunes window rather than sitting more naturally alongside the store's content.</p> <p><strong>Price</strong> As with blinkbox, rentals are available to watch for 30 days, with the film expiring 48 hours after you begin watching it. iTunes titles are generally the same price to rent as blinkbox, with new release rentals at \u00a33.49 and many older titles at \u00a32.49. But it is often cheaper to buy a title at iTunes than its competitor (Prometheus is \u00a39.99 compared with \u00a310.99 at blinkbox). It's worth bearing in mind that iTunes often displays the HD version (ie, the more expensive option) of a film first, meaning users have to manually select the standard definition (cheaper) version.</p> <p>iTunes offers a 99p rental film of the week (at the time of writing, Tim Burton's The Corpse Bride), and often has a 99p section, but this seems to drop off the homepage randomly, making it hard to find special offers. Crucially, there are no free movies: the \"free on iTunes\" section merely contains promotional featurettes for recent films rather than any free content you would wish to watch. Disappointing.</p> <p><strong>Deals </strong>Nothing applicable on Vouchercloud or Vouchercodes.co.uk.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong> A very good selection of new and current releases and a decent back catalogue of titles. iTunes seems to allow you to buy or rent more titles than blinkbox (where many older titles are rental only).</p> <p><strong>Quality of download</strong> Better than blinkbox, in my opinion, though iTunes doesn't offer streaming. You can also pay an extra \u00a31 to rent or buy HD films. But iTunes seemed more dependent on a good internet connection, with rentals taking some time to begin playing during busy evening hours.</p> <p><strong>Verdict </strong>8/10.</p> <p><strong>Mark's verdict </strong>Blinkbox offers hundreds of free movies and TV programmes (albeit with advert breaks), many of which are films I would pay to watch; whereas iTunes has a poor selection of 99p films, let alone decent movies for free. So blinkbox almost scoops the prize for this alone. iTunes, by contrast, seems to want your cash at every opportunity, as evidenced by the fact it cheekily displays pricier HD films above the cheaper standard versions.</p> <p>But iTunes has similar content to blinkbox, better quality downloads, superior navigation, cheaper prices and offers HD films too. You can also watch films on an iPad, which makes the service useful for my daily train commute. I give this one to iTunes, but blinkbox is certainly one to watch.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/12/sky-plus-youview-which-is-best\" title=\"\"><strong>Last week</strong></a></p> <p>We pitted Sky+ against the YouView box, and despite the higher cost preferred Sky, mainly because of the additional features such as apps that let you remotely record films/TV.

  "<p>Social enterprise is attracting meritocrats \u2013 people with achievements from different walks of life. Energy to do good and to do well at the same time is admirable. The influx of talent brings resources and challenges mediocrity, yet our 'merits' in one field may not help in others.</p> <p>Most social enterprises exist to help people left behind by our meritocratic world. Those who have lived the problem may have better solutions than meritocratic entrepreneurs. Good people doing smart things may have more impact than smart people doing good things.</p> <p>Those of us who have grown up in meritocracies can have blind spots in social enterprise. Consider three mistakes we make.</p> <p>First, we push small social enterprises to scale up when sometimes a spread of smaller organisations would have more impact. Some social enterprises need to grow to reap economies of scale: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" title=\"\">Wikipedia</a> has global reach, and the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operative</a> needs to be large to purchase efficiently. But many social enterprises are more effective if they are small and local.</p> <p>Crime reduction programmes flourish or fail neighbourhood by neighbourhood. Business discovered years ago that small can be beautiful: small firms create more jobs and growth than large companies. The <a href=\"http://www.the-icsf.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Social Franchising</a> is helping good ideas spread without big bureaucracies. An ecosystem of small community-based organisations, though, is messy and chaotic. Meritocrats tend to like things neat and tidy.</p> <p>Second, we spend more time on capital than on revenue. We are excited by the opportunities to create new instruments such as social investment bonds, or new legal forms such as community interest companies. The government has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/apr/04/david-cameron-big-society-fund\" title=\"\">invested \u00a3600m</a> into \"Big Society Capital\". Yet most social enterprises have little revenue, or any chance of it, and become charities addicted to gaining more donations.</p> <p>For a social enterprise to stand on its own feet, it needs revenue: fees, contracts or sales. Working to make a social enterprise pay can be harder and more boring than attracting capital. Procurement processes designed for large suppliers can wear down small organisations. Services for the disadvantaged often need government money, but civil servants prefer to purchase from 'one-stop shops': large companies such as <a href=\"http://www.serco.com/\" title=\"\">Serco</a> or <a href=\"http://www.g4s.com/\" title=\"\">G4S</a>.</p> <p>Third, we favour our own. We shine the light on meritocratic entrepreneurs with linear logic. Meritocrats in government and philanthropy give support, contracts and capital to those they trust. Trustees are usually well-spoken and well-heeled. Awards ceremonies can show a hierarchy, with the great and the good at the top, the entrepreneur in the middle, and the 'beneficiaries' at the bottom. Yet merit on one field may not play well on another.</p> <p>I have two dyslexic friends who struggled at school, but are now great social entrepreneurs: one shunned academic learning, but flourished in the more practical <a href=\"http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Clore Social Leadership Programme</a>. Non-profit chief executives on four continents have asked me: \"Why do the business people on my board check their brains at the door?\" With the best will in the world, we can disempower the very communities we try to help.</p> <p>It's ironic that a social entrepreneur coined the word 'meritocracy' in the 1950s to warn that a world led by merit could be as harsh as one ruled by class or money. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Young,_Baron_Young_of_Dartington\" title=\"\">Michael Young</a>, dubbed \"probably the world's greatest entrepreneur of social enterprises\", forecast a society with increasing differences in wealth and greater disdain for working-class people. He had written the 1945 Labour manifesto, but suspected that making 'equality of opportunity' an ideal could make the party more technocratic than democratic.</p> <p>I'm a product of the 1950s myself. I like how London has become cleaner, more prosperous and a melting pot for all kinds of people. I was proud to see the Olympic welcome. But I do not like the changes that Young prophesied: increasing income inequality, declining social mobility and a popular scorn for working-class people, who are labelled 'chavs'.</p> <p>Based in Bethnal Green, Young helped spawn dozens of organisations, such as Which?, The Open University and the School for Social Entrepreneurs. I am a fellow of The Young Foundation, which tries to keep up what he started.</p> <p>Young did not dislike meritocrats \u2013 he had risen on his own merits. He just believed that the best way to solve social problems was to give power to those with the problem, who are rarely meritocrats themselves. He questioned meritocracy. Let's all question our own merits.</p> <p><em>Jon Huggett is a visiting fellow at the </em><a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship</em></a><em>, and founder of The Third Foundation, where he advises social enterprise leaders worldwide.

  "<p>A report published on Friday makes some surprising and rather alarming claims. Apparently, 60% of young people in custody say they have experienced a traumatic brain injury. To put this figure into perspective, the incidence of brain injury is typically <a href=\"http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/77/5/699.abstract\" title=\"\">higher in the population under 25</a> than in older people, but <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21069616\" title=\"\">recent research</a> cited in the report suggests it is higher still for under-25s who find themselves involved in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>It would be easy to read this and conclude that, via some complex but poorly understood mechanism, brain injury turns young people into criminals. In fact, it is depressingly likely that this precise claim will be made by some prominent media establishment, maybe before you've even read this. However, the implications of the report are far more subtle and complex.</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.bctrust.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Repairing-Shattered-Lives_Report.pdf\" title=\"\">Repairing Shattered Lives: Brain Injury and its Implications for Criminal Justice</a>, was written by <a href=\"http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=huw_williams\" title=\"\">Professor Huw Williams</a> and commissioned by the <a href=\"http://www.bctrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Barrow Cadbury Trust</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.t2a.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Transition to Adulthood (T2A) Alliance</a>. It is important to understand the rationale behind T2A, which \"promotes effective approaches for young people in the transition to adulthood (16-25 year olds) throughout the criminal justice process\". As far as the criminal justice system is concerned, people aged over 18 are rational mature adults and should be treated as such when caught engaging in criminal behaviour. T2A argues that this approach is at best unhelpful, at worst actually making criminal behaviour more likely in the long term.</p> <p>We often forget that the majority of age limits imposed by society are arbitrary. A good example of this has been in the news recently with 16-year-olds potentially being allowed to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-challenged-to-reduce-voting-age-after-it-drops-opposition-to-16yearolds-taking-part-in-scottish-independence-referendum-8205851.html\" title=\"\">vote in the referendum on Scottish independence</a>, rather than limiting it to those over 18, as is standard in the UK. Age limits and restrictions rarely correspond to scientific evidence. A 16-year-old isn't any more resistant to the damaging effects of smoking than a 14-year-old.</p> <p>This isn't to dismiss age restrictions as irrelevant or illogical; they exist for very good reasons. For instance, in the strictest biological sense, the concept of an \"underage pregnancy\" is nonsensical \u2013 if a female is physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, then she is old enough to reproduce as far as nature is concerned. But society rightly recognises that just because someone is biologically capable of doing something, they are not necessarily mentally capable of doing it without causing damage to themselves or others. Ensuring an individual is mature enough to understand and handle the consequences of potentially damaging actions is why age restrictions exist.</p> <p>But this concept of \"maturity\" is where problems arise. As soon as someone reaches a legally determined age, they don't automatically mature overnight. There is no internal \"no/yes\" maturity switch that gets flipped. Biology is not binary, cognition even less so. But the criminal justice system works under the assumption that, once an individual is 18, they are mature enough to be considered a typical adult. T2A argues that this is not the case, and that young adults should be recognised as a distinct group by the criminal justice system, and their maturity, cognitive development and socioeconomic factors should be considered when processing them, up to and including sentencing.</p> <p>There is scientific evidence to support this claim. An extensive <a href=\"http://www.t2a.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Birmingham-University-Maturity-final-literature-review-report.pdf\" title=\"\">literature review</a> by Birmingham University (also commissioned by the Barrow Cadbury Trust for the T2A) supports this view. Recent studies into post-adolescent brain development reveal that our brains continue to develop <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110922134617.htm\" title=\"\">well into our 20s</a>, and these developments are concerned with more complex abilities such as <a href=\"http://www.ncld.org/types-learning-disabilities/executive-function-disorders/what-is-executive-function\" title=\"\">executive functioning</a> and <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/288244/inhibition\" title=\"\">inhibition</a>, which overrule our need for immediate reward, moderate our impulsive actions and regulate our emotions. These are what the majority of people would recognise as signs of maturity.</p> <p>But this applies to \"normal\" young adults. Repairing Shattered Lives highlights another factor that has a serious impact on the cognitive development and behaviour of young adults: brain injury and trauma.</p> <p>Head injury is a very serious matter. It is not like in films, when someone is knocked out in a fight only to come round a few minutes later, make a witty quip and carry on as if nothing had happened. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001802/\" title=\"\">Concussion</a> is serious enough, even if it does not cause lasting damage. Any injury to the head that causes a period of unconsciousness <a href=\"http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Glasgow-Coma-Scale-(GCS).htm\" title=\"\">should be taken seriously</a>, as it could result in serious long-term injury. Given the complexity of the brain and uncertain nature of brain injury, the eventual consequences of traumatic brain injury can vary considerably, potentially leading to serious disorders <a href=\"http://www.benthamscience.com/cpsr/sample/cpsr3-1/D0004SR.pdf\" title=\"\">such as schizophrenia</a>. </p> <p>Brain injury is potentially more damaging in younger people, as it could disrupt cognitive development. The developing brain can show <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21482550\" title=\"\">remarkable resilience</a> for such a complex and fragile organ, but in the cases of severe injury it is more a case of compensation than repair \u2013 the brain \"works around\" the damage, rather than undoing it, which means brain development can be disrupted in the long term. According to the report, these disruptions could lead to an <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11723190\" title=\"\">increased tendency</a> for <a href=\"http://144.92.57.236/research/turkstra/publications/Turkstra%20Violent%20Crime%202003.pdf\" title=\"\">criminal behaviour</a>.</p> <p>As it states, \"Those without a TBI [traumatic brain injury] are likely to grow out of immature and antisocial behaviour by their mid-twenties, those with TBI are likely to continue to grapple with these issues throughout young adulthood and beyond\".</p> <p>This does not mean that all young people who suffer brain injury go on to become criminals. Many do not. A police database of all young people who have suffered head injuries would be unnecessary, invasive and largely useless. And the relationship is also two-way. Those who are already more prone to risky behaviour such as criminal acts are more likely to find themselves in contexts where head injury occurs, meaning it could be the criminal behaviour that leads to the brain injury, not the other way round. But in young adults, brain injury increases the likelihood of eventual criminal behaviour. It's not a \"cause\", per se.</p> <p>Overall, the evidence suggests that brain injury can be a significant variable in criminal behaviour, and as such should be considered when making decisions about sentencing and rehabilitation. However, at present, young people aren't screened for brain injury and thus are rarely if ever referred for necessary rehabilitation. As a result, the primary contact that many young people with brain injury have with service providers is via the criminal justice system, which is obviously ill equipped to deal with and treat brain trauma.</p> <p>The Shattered Lives report puts forward strong evidence for this to change. Young offenders should be screened for brain injury, and if present it should be addressed through relevant treatments and therapies when attempting rehabilitation. This approach could cut reoffending rates and eventually reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the criminal justice system.</p> <p>There are of course many complications to be considered when proposing such a reform. For example, no two brain injuries are exactly the same, so symptoms and appropriate treatments will vary considerably between individuals. There is also the matter of whether people trained to deal with young offenders are qualified or even capable of recognising the signs and consequences of brain injury. </p> <p>How would the extent of the brain trauma be determined? It would be impractical, to say the least, to install an <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/MRI-scan/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">MRI scanner</a> and qualified operators in every police station. And, regarding the maturity of young offenders, how would one determine the level of such an abstract concept in an individual?</p> <p>Many of these concerns could be addressed. Work is already under way on tools for determining mental state and maturity, such as targeted questionnaires, and training in their use could be provided. But then, this would rely on offenders being open and honest with the authority figures responsible for prosecuting them, which would require a degree of maturity and control. The whole point of the process is that they may lack these things.</p> <p>There is no quick and easy solution to the issues raised in the report, but a greater awareness of the effect developmental maturity and brain injury can have on criminal behaviour in young adults can only be of benefit to the criminal justice system, and society as whole.</p> <p>I've <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/22/gcse-results-exams-easier-impact\" title=\"\">written before</a> about how damaging it can be to demand certain types of behaviour from teenagers (and punishing them based on this) without taking into account the physiological and cognitive changes they are undergoing. This report only emphasises that point further.</p> <p>Nobody is arguing that young offenders shouldn't be punished for the crimes they commit. But taking into account the effect that developmental maturity and brain injury can have on their behaviour could greatly reduce the likelihood of the punishment being needed again.</p> <p><strong><em>Dean Burnett</em></strong><em> is a doctor of neuroscience and </em><a href=\"http://www.mscpsychiatry.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>teaches psychiatry at Cardiff University</em></a><em>.

The Government must begin planning a policy framework for 3D printing, one which promotes innovation and prepares the ground for a mass market in 3D printing.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html\">Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd v Apple Inc [2012] EWCA Civ 1339 (18 October 2012) &gt;&gt; Bailli</a></h2> <p>The judges' decision, led by Sir Robin Jacob, on whether Apple should have to advertise that Samsung didn't infringe its iPad design: </p> <blockquote> <p>Given the massive publicity of HHJ Birss's \"not as cool\" judgment, if there had been nothing else I would not have let the order he made come into force. Events had made it unnecessary.</p> <p> But I have come to the firm conclusion that such an order is necessary now. The decision of the [German] Oberlandesgericht received much publicity. What was the ordinary consumer, or the marketing department of a potential Samsung customer to make of it? On the one hand the media said Samsung had won, on the other the media were saying that Apple had a German Europe-wide injunction. Real commercial uncertainty was thereby created. A consumer might well think \"I had better not buy a Samsung - maybe it's illegal and if I buy one it may not be supported\". A customer (and I include its legal department) might well wonder whether, if it bought Samsung's 7.7 it might be in trouble before the German courts. Safest thing to do either way is not to buy.</p> </blockquote> <p> And this is where going to court can backfire in the most enormous way. If Apple hadn't been pursuing a separate case in Germany, and if His Honour Judge Birss hadn't been sitting in a Community-wide court, it wouldn't have mattered. Now, unless Apple appeals this further, it's going to be stuck spending money talking about a rival's product.</p> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

  "<p>Companies have paid former interns hundreds of pounds after they petitioned to be paid the minimum wage.</p> <p>Celebrity magazine NOW, a south London auction house and a major international media conglomerate have paid out more than \u00a32,250 after two interns demanded to be given a wage for over seven-and-a-half months of work. </p> <p>The case follows several other settlements made without recourse to the courts, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/30/miss-selfridge-interns-pay-arcadia\">including those of interns working for clothing retail group Arcadia</a>, which owns Top Shop and Miss Selfridge. </p> <p>Both interns were offered payouts after the <a href=\"http://graduatefog.co.uk/2012/2080/interns-fight-justice-campaign/\">Justice for Interns campaign</a>, run by jobs website <a href=\"http://graduatefog.co.uk/\">Graduate Fog</a> and <a href=\"http://www.internaware.org/\">Intern Aware</a>, took up their cause. </p> <p>A 27-year-old graduate of Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design who wanted to be known by her middle name, Anita, said she had been paid around \u00a3750 for a one-month internship last year at <a href=\"http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/\">NOW</a>.</p> <p>Anita said that although she attended a few fashion shoots, she spent most of her time working in a stockroom \"packing and unpacking\" clothes with another intern. </p> <p>\"It wasn't what I signed up to do \u2026 Generally you weren't treated very well.\"<br> She added that she was shown the ropes by one intern and didn't meet management staff until a week into the placement. She then went on to train her intern replacement.</p> <p>The magazine's publisher, IPC media, said the reason for the settlement was that Anita had progressed to paid tasks. </p> <p>In a statement it said: \"IPC has a very clear policy covering work experience, internships and short-term freelance contracts. The individual undertook what had been understood by both parties to be unpaid work experience, but, during that time, it appears that she progressed to carrying out tasks for which she was entitled to be paid. </p> <p>\"Once this was brought to our attention, the payment was made through IPC's payroll.\"</p> <p>IPC also disputed the term internship and said that it was usual for work experience staff to hand over to each other, though they would always meet with staff at the start of their placement. \"This was a work experience placement. This individual was not an intern. Work experience staff already progressed into their placement may be asked to explain to newer work experience staff normal process etc. Passing on knowledge already gained and best practice is also a valuable part of the work experience,\" it said.</p> <p>Anita, who was on jobseeker's allowance during this period, went on to do a six-month unpaid internship at a south London auction house, where she was told to clean and vacuum the office and catalogue items that were being put up for sale.</p> <p>\"It was all the jobs you'd have to do at an auction house but people were getting paid to do. I was doing them, and being asked to do them,\" she said. </p> <p>\"They basically led me on to believe that when a place became available I would be offered the job \u2026 if I stayed on and worked hard and impressed them I would up for the position.\"</p> <p>However, after five months of full-time unpaid work, the company failed to inform her that they were offering a paid job and subsequently gave the position to an outsider.<br> \"I felt a bit stupid. Even though I was working there, I had to work [unpaid] alongside someone who'd just joined.\" </p> <p>The company eventually offered her \u00a31,000 in a settlement, a sixth of her minimum wage claim. </p> <p>Last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/04/interns-work-paid-lawyers\">government lawyers warned ministers</a> that many employers were breaking national minimum wage rules by not paying interns, advising that \"most interns are likely to be workers and therefore entitled to the NMW\".</p> <p>\"People should think carefully before doing internships because you can be really misled,\" Anita said. \"I've done a few now, so I know better, but I think everyone should claim their money back. It's only fair. You put in the hours but you end up with nothing.\" </p> <p>A second intern, who could not reveal his name or that of the company he worked for without breaking the terms of a post-settlement gagging agreement, said that he had worked for two weeks for a major US-owned media conglomerate, during which time he was doing exactly the same work as other staff and was offered very little training.</p> <p>In a settlement letter sent last month the company wrote \"they were very surprised\" to receive a letter \"stating that you feel you are entitled to be paid\".<br> \"However,\" the letter said, \"the company is willing to pay you the sum of \u00a3486.40, which amounts to the minimum wage for the hours which you worked.\"</p> <p>News of the payouts also follows the publication of the third and <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/Higher-Education.pdf\">final report</a> from the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/18/coalition-child-poverty-ema-1\">social mobility tsar, Alan Milburn</a>, on Wednesday. Milburn said he was concerned by the \"number of universities whose&#xa0;careers services advertise unpaid internships\", and recommended that universities should no longer \"facilitate any exploitative work placements of any kind\". </p> <p>Tanya de Grunwald, founder of Graduate Fog and one of the organisers of the campaign said: \"These payouts are hugely significant for our campaign against unpaid internships. </p> <p>\"Companies are realising they don't have the right to unlimited free labour just because someone is young and desperate for experience. After years of being downtrodden and voiceless, interns are finding the courage to stand up to the tight-fisted employers who thought they could get something for nothing without any repercussions. </p> <p>\"Interns contact us every day with new stories \u2013 some of whom have worked for very famous companies and individuals \u2013 so we look forward to more victories like this in the next few weeks. It's going to get ugly.\"</p> <p>Gus Baker from Intern Aware added: \"We are delighted to see NOW magazine and big companies coughing up and paying young people ... But it's a strange state of affairs when the government is failing to enforce its own minimum-wage law, and pressure groups are left to fill the gap.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012 to correct grammatical errors.</p>",

But that changed when the softly spoken undertaker, closing her family-run funeral parlour, joined thousands of protesters on Thursday in a mass outpouring of fury over austerity policies that have plunged ever growing numbers of Greeks into poverty and fear.</p> <p>\"After three years of non-stop taxes and wage cuts it's got to the point where nothing has been left standing,\" she said drawing on a cigarette. \"It's so bad families can no longer afford to even bury their dead. Bodies lie unclaimed at public hospitals so that the local municipality can bury them.\"</p> <p>As Greece was brought to a grinding halt by its second general strike in less than a month, Mendaleni wanted to send a message to the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, and other EU leaders meeting in Brussels.</p> <p>\"We once had a life that was dignified. Now the country has gone back 50 years and these politicians have to be made aware that enough is enough.\"</p> <p>Greek demonstrations are not now marked by the vehemence or violence of the mass protests that occurred when Europe's debt drama erupted in Athens, forcing the then socialist government to announce pay and pension cuts, tax increases and benefit losses that few had anticipated. Anger and bewilderment have been replaced by disappointment and despair.</p> <p>But the quiet fortitude that has been on display could soon run out in the country on the frontline of the continent's worst crisis since the second world war. For on Thursday demonstrators were sure of one thing: if pushed too far they may be pushed over the edge.</p> <p>\"Personally, I'm amazed there hasn't been a revolution,\" said Panaghiotis Varotsos, a computer programmer.</p> <p>\"In Portugal they're rioting over one measure when here we've been made to accept countless cuts and tax increases. And the worst thing about being ground down is that it breeds extremism,\" said the silver-haired leftist. \"In the case of Greece it is extremism that is going to the right because [the neo-Nazi party] Golden Dawn has managed to exploit people's despair. But it won't just stay here. It will spread, like this economic crisis, to other parts of Europe, too.\"</p> <p>For the vast majority of those who took to the streets, the tipping point could be the latest round of austerity measures being demanded of the debt-stricken country in return for the international rescue funds it so desperately needs to keep bankruptcy at bay.</p> <p>Under intense pressure from international creditors at the EU and IMF, Samaras' fragile coalition has been forced to draw up a draconian package of spending cuts worth \u20ac13.5bn \u2013 the price of a whopping \u20ac31.5bn loan instalment that is already four months overdue. Officials have suggested the burden will fall on society's most vulnerable with pensioners and low-income Greeks once again having to make the biggest sacrifices.</p> <p>\"After nearly 50 years of work and paying into an expensive pension fund, I have been forced to retire on \u20ac1,000 a month and if they pass these measures it will be even less,\" said 60-year-old Nikos Xeros, who until this year had repaired ships since the age of 16. \"It's like having a noose about your neck that is getting ever tighter. The next time I come out to demonstrate it's going to be with a gas mask and a big wooden club.\"</p> <p>Law enforcement officials cut off access to Syntagma Square \u2013 home of the Greek parliament \u2013 before protesters could reach it, stoking widespread fury on Thursday. For some it was evidence of the mounting fears that parliament could be stormed.</p> <p>\"Greeks are becoming increasingly conscious \u2026 and it was especially noticeable that the main slogan today was 'the time has come to overthrow these polices',\" said Tania Karayiannis of the union of civil servants. As many as 80,000 people participated in the protests in Athens alone, she said. \"The political leadership of this country should not underestimate that. If they don't take our opposition seriously they will bear historic responsibility for the disintegration of Greece's social fabric and the developments that will surely follow.\"</p>",

  "<p>Theresa May told US authorities in July that there were no legal or medical grounds on which she could block the extradition of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson has claimed.</p> <p>May defied the American authorities on Tuesday by halting the extradition, a decision criticised by the US state department but welcomed by UK campaigners and politicians. But Johnson, who originally approved the extradition in November 2009, accused his successor of taking the \"easy way out\" by putting popularity before justice.</p> <p>\"Mrs May saw the same medical evidence, produced by McKinnon's team, that I saw as home secretary. Although it was submitted after the 2009 judgment, it was in essence the same,\" he wrote. \"The US was entitled not just to request McKinnon's extradition, but to expect it. And Theresa May has not reached a brave decision \u2013 she's taken the easy way out.</p> <p>\"The Home Secretary is there to uphold the law; to put justice before popularity. Irrespective of how many plaudits it receives, this was an appalling decision.\"</p> <p>Johnson's approval of the extradition was delayed by several appeals until after the last general election. The case finally reached an end when May told the House of Commons that she had taken the quasi-judicial decision to block extradition on human rights grounds because of medical reports warning that McKinnon, 46, who has Asperger's syndrome and suffers from depressive illness, could kill himself if sent to stand trial in the US.</p> <p>Johnson also claimed that May told the US that there were \"ramifications for national security\" if she prevented the extradition on the grounds of McKinnon's healthas suspected terrorists could use the same argument that they might suffer inhuman or degrading treatment to avoid being extradited. The warning was contained in a letter from May to US attorney general Eric Holder, according to the <em>Telegraph</em>.</p> <p>McKinnon was first indicted by an American grand jury in November 2002 for hacking into US military computers, including the Pentagon and Nasa, from his north London bedroom while he was looking for UFOs. He could have faced a prison sentence of up 70 years under US law.</p> <p>Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, will now decide whether McKinnon should be prosecuted in Britain. A US state department spokeswoman expressed disapointment with May's decision.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The home secretary made clear in her statement to the House that she withdrew the extradition order against Mr McKinnon after careful consideration of the medical and legal evidence. She concluded his extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that it would be incompatible with his human rights.\"</p>"
