Photograph: Dave Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hill/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Regular readers will know the vital facts: the planned Earls Court redevelopment project is one of the capital's largest, with its backers promising 7,500 new homes, 6,000 of them for market sale, and economic rejuvenation for 77 acres of inner West London and its surrounding territory; those supporters include the Conservative-run boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F), Kensington and Chelsea (K&amp;C), their developer partner Capco and Conservative London mayor Boris Johnson, who seems extremely unlikely to use his powers to impede the scheme.</p> <p>Meanwhile, opponents of the project claim that it's impractical and motivated by money lust and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/31/earls-court-project-stephen-greenhalgh-andy-slaughter-social-engineering-claim\">low electoral motives</a>; a judicial review of a key planning document is to proceed; the events industry is opposed to the proposed destruction of the two Earls Court exhibition centre buildings; a panel of architects is opposed to its design; residents of two estates threatened with demolition by the project have expressed opposition in a public consultation by a ratio of at least three to one. </p> <p>What happens next seems in the balance, with both sides of the argument insisting they will prevail. What is already beyond doubt is that the battle over Earls Court has distilled and crystalised core themes of the debate about urban redevelopment, localism, housing policy, planning law and the future character of London as a whole. It has also mobilised a grassroots neighbourhood organisation and power of a type we might have thought consigned to history.</p> <p>Sally Taylor and Diana Belshaw are the respective chairs of the tenants and residents associations (TRAs) of the two demolition-threatened estates, the West Kensington and the smaller, adjoining Gibbs Green. Both TRAs are strongly against the demolition of the estates, and favours instead taking community-led ownership of them. When I visited Sally and Diana at Sally's flat on Monday evening, I began by simply asking them to tell me why they think the Earls Court project is a bad idea. </p> <p>They offered a number of reasons, but the theme they warmed to with most fervour was their view that residents of the estates have been denigrated, misrepresented and deceived by the council in the service of its own, hostile agenda. \"They're quite prepared to demolish perfectly good homes,\" Sally says. \"Solid concrete, large, where people are happy. They should be proud of this estate. Yet from the beginning they've called us a sink estate.\"</p> <p>They cite council documents characterising West Kensington and Gibbs Green as being in poor physical condition, with high levels of crime, unemployment, rates of teenage pregnancy, and generally blighted with social deprivation - a sorry state from which demolition and rehousing into more \"mixed communities\" and jobs created by a wider redevelopment would rescue their unfortunate inhabitants. </p> <p>The unflattering depiction is much like that found in the 2009 think tank pamphlet Principles for Social Housing Reform, co-authored by the then council leader Stephen Greenhalgh, who now heads Boris Johnson's office for policing and crime and whose views on housing and welfare permeate Conservative and coalition national policies. </p> <p>\"Social housing was meant to help lift people out of the slums. Instead many social housing estates have become the very ghettos of multiple social deprivation that they were supposed to replace,\" it contends. \"Politicians responsible for large swathes of social housing must make every effort they can to create mixed communities in their most deprived areas.\"</p> <p>Do West Kensington and Gibbs Green fit this description? Do the people who live there? Would those among them who are poor, unwell, unemployed or have been troubled by crime find these problems reduced by having their homes knocked down and moving into a newer one, perhaps in closer proximity to more people who are better off than they are?</p> <p>\"They actually believe their own bullshit,\" Sally says. \"They actually believed that no one had a job, no one could read or write, and all we could do was shag donkeys and have babies. That's basically their starting point. There was no bloody respect shown for ordinary people who drive the London buses, clean the London offices, drive the Tube, work in the NHS, all the things that society holds dear. That was their biggest mistake. They made assumptions: oh, stupid, thick, uneducated, pregnant people will just roll over and take this.\"</p> <p>If so, they were mistaken. To portray the estates as mono-tenured, inward-looking incubators of a self-perpetuating hand-out culture is to ignore its medical professionals - Sally and Diana, for example, are both nurses working in the health service - entrepreneurs, engineers and, ironically enough, property developers, and that its 760 households included 171 leasehold or freehold properties. The TRA chairs also contend that the council's definition of \"workless\" residents encompasses those many who are simply retired. </p> <p>The argument now often made that the very design of housing estates with a strong social housing element fosters isolation from participation from society's mainstream is somewhat belied by the size of the response rate to the council's consultation on including the estates in the wider Earls Court project. The overall figure was 67.7%, and 57% among the secure council tenants. By contrast, the rate among residents in the surrounding area was just 2% of the 29,240 properties from whom a response was sought. A vivid and relentless anti-demolition campaign has been co-ordinated by Jonathan Rosenberg, a passionate veteran of the successful resistance to Dame Shirley Porter's scandalous \"homes-for-votes\" policy in Westminster in the 1980s. </p> <p>The premise that housing tenure and configuration are, of themselves, inevitably generators of social evils is contested by Diana. \"It's as if they think that by moving people it's going to make the sick well and bring people off benefits. How are you going to make someone that's got a long-term condition that means they can't work, how is it that by moving them it's going to make them well and be able to get back into work?\" Sally argues that if the estates are to some extent self-enclosed, this feature is not damned as antisocial in other types of residential property, such as affluent \"gated communities.\"</p> <p>Both women delight in stories of inviting supporters of demolition into their homes in order to confound preconceptions. Sally once showed two Conservative ladies from Chelsea round her place. \"\"They said, 'Oh but you'll get something much nicer.' That's what gets to me. It's this prescriptive attitude - 'You poor people, you can have this and you should be jolly well grateful for it.' So I said to these women, 'How do you know what these flats are like?' I showed them round. I wouldn't let them leave! I showed them the bedrooms, I showed them the walls, and they were really shocked. And that's the thing. We've been talked about as if we're not in the room. The way they describe it, it's like the whole place is covered in graffiti and there's cars burning everywhere.\"</p> <p>Diana describes a visit from Stephen Greenhalgh himself during the 2010 general and borough election campaigns. \"I took him into my house to show him there's nothing wrong with it. I showed him a photograph of me with my cap and gown, just to show him that we're not all under-educated. And even if we were, that doesn't make us any less a person.\" Her story developed to include Greenhalgh becoming emotional and her becoming cross - so cross that she picked up a frying pan. \"I wouldn't have hit him with it. I just wanted to show him my anger, but he just didn't seem to want to listen.\" I was reassured that the frying pan was both empty and spotlessly clean.</p> <p>Sally and Diana believe that the council was been its own worst enemy from the start by seeking buyers for the two estates, and others, without telling residents first and then trying to deny it. They say that efforts by the council and its developer partner Capco to engage with the community have been driven more by a desire to break down resistance than to listen. \"In the very early days, this fellow from the developers said to me, 'Sally, we need to talk. Have a fruit gum,' he said. He was a bit, you know, smart - take my number, and all this. I actually said to him, 'I will not sell my soul to the devil.' He thought I could be bought with a fruit gum.\" </p> <p>Both women recoil from a soft sell language in which \"regeneration\" means \"demolition,\" and proposed new, tall residential buildings are called not \"tower blocks\" but \"mansion blocks.\" They see themselves as being made \"pawns in a big boys' chess game. We're disposable. They're forcing us to take a medicine that we don't want and don't need.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday the two TRAs held their annual general meeting. The evening's business included seeking members' support for a document headed Agreement of The People. Composed by Rosenberg<strong>*</strong>, whose rhetorical repertoire revels in rejecting understatement, it contains the following assertions:</p> <blockquote> <p>In our hearts and in our minds, we know that this demolition scheme is totally wrong. It's mistaken because it destroys a decent neighbourhood and thriving industries; it's unkind because it damages the most vulnerable people; it's morally repugnant because it privileges the powerful over the weak. </p> <p>Every shade of decent opinion marvels: whenever were knavish tricks to be preferred over hard work? Whenever was it just for personal interest to triumph over the collective good? Whenever was it right for the rich to profit at the expense of the poor?</p> </blockquote> <p>And another thing:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Council and the developer haven't the slightest chance of getting away with their greedy, selfish, nasty scheme. We fight for justice; we shall win our freedom; and we shall impose the peace...We, the residents of West Kensington and Gibbs Green agree:</p> <p><strong>1</strong>. Not to be bribed, bought, or bullied into giving up our homes. </p> <p><strong>2</strong>. To support our neighbours to defeat this evil scheme, to help each other to resist, come what may. </p> <p><strong>3</strong>. Never to give up on the trustful relationships we've established; never to lose the faith; and never to abandon our righteous cause. </p> <p>Our vision shines bright and true: we shall live together in community, confident that our destiny is to own our land. The future is ours to control, so long as we achieve it together, as one...These are our homes; this is our neighbourhood; and we shall never surrender! </p> <p>Power to the People!</p> </blockquote> <p>The Agreement was adopted. The council has a long, hard fight on its hands.</p> <p><strong>Update, 1 November 2012</strong>. Jonathan Rosenberg has asked me to say that the Agreement emerged from the work of his fellow community organisers as well as from himself, and expresses the sentiments of residents opposed to demolition, as previously expressed in their responses to the council's consultation. </p>",
  "<p>Luis Su\u00e1rez is tireless, according to Brendan Rodgers, never complaining about carrying Liverpool's attack on his own but simply getting on with the job with commendable enthusiasm, but it never does any harm to use the Capital One Cup to check on the strength in reserve.</p> <p>So it was a warm Anfield welcome to Samed Yesil, making his first Liverpool start since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in summer, and a warm welcome back to Joe Cole, who apart from a hamstring-curtailed 23 minutes in a Europa League qualifier in early August has not been seen for a year, having spent last season on loan at Lille. The French club would have been happy to extend the loan, so successful was Cole's stay, but when he heard Rodgers wanted him in his squad he came straight back.</p> <p>While he probably imagined he would get more games than has turned out to be the case, Rodgers argues that it would be unfair to discard the young players who stepped in during his injury just because one of the senior professionals has returned to fitness, adding that he was looking forward to giving Cole a chance to see what he could do.</p> <p>What that boils down to is that at the age of 30, Cole was effectively on trial, arguably under more pressure to perform than the 18-year-old Turkish-German striker with whom he was attempting to strike up a partnership. Yesil has yet to make his name, after all, time is on his side, and with so little experience there are no immediate expectations.</p> <p>Cole keeps having to try to live up to the name he made for himself over a decade ago. Having come to Liverpool in search of stability after Chelsea, he finds himself on his third manager in two years and as far away as ever from a regular place in the team.</p> <p>This uncomfortable audition will have done nothing for his peace of mind. There was no attacking partnership, for a start. Yesil was even more anonymous than Cole, and that was saying something. In the early stages Cole was upstaged by the other Joe in the Liverpool team, Joe Allen, who was running the home side's show against his former club from a deeper midfield position and putting Swansea on the back foot by cleverly mixing short and long passes.</p> <p>Swansea never mind being on the back foot, though, they simply play their way back into the game, and it soon became apparent that Rodgers's old club had a few more attacking ideas than his present one.</p> <p>Even when Liverpool were going forward they mostly went down the flanks, through Stewart Downing or Jordan Henderson, despite it being obvious from an early stage that neither Yesil nor Cole were going to thrive on a succession of crosses. When Swansea went forward they passed their way through Liverpool's central defence, sometimes continuing to pass when they were well within shooting range and a direct attempt would have been the better option.</p> <p>It was slightly ironic when Swansea scored with a header from a corner after Jonathan de Guzm\u00e1n and Michu had both missed inviting opportunities with the ball at their feet, yet it was no injustice. Swansea deserved to be in front, and Liverpool needed to find a way to bring Cole and Yesil more effectively into the attack, for the game was taking place around them.</p> <p>Within a couple of minutes of going behind Cole was presented with a chance to equalise when a cross from the left found him unmarked in front of goal, only to react with an unconvincing header straight at the goalkeeper. Cole is not renowned for his heading, nor is he anyone's idea of a goalscoring centre-forward, but given that he had seen so little of the ball he really needed to make something happen when it finally came his way. Su\u00e1rez or Steven Gerrard would have done better, one could not help but feel, and it was no surprise when that pair took the field for the second half, with Cole and Yesil making way.</p> <p>At a whole 45 minutes, Cole's latest Liverpool appearance was almost twice as long as his last, but sadly it was just as unproductive. Liverpool attacked with more urgency in the second half, though in truth they could hardly have attacked with any less.</p> <p>Short of attacking options though Liverpool might be, it appears Cole is unlikely to form one of them, and he might need another move to find a regular position, let alone a regular game. As long as Su\u00e1rez, who salvaged a headed goal for Liverpool, is fit and available, Cole appears destined just to make the odd bit-part appearance in his final season as Liverpool, and there might not be too many of those now the club's interest in the Capital One Cup has ended.</p>",
  "<p>The last few days offer a salutary reminder of how a species that can seem to control everything is not in control of some very important things. There isn't much equivalence between the towering force of super-storm Sandy and the insidious progress of Chalara fraxinea, the fungal disease that threatens the UK's third most populous tree, but they have this much in common: both speak of the need to respect the natural world and the consequences of ignoring its fragility. We are overconfident in our own capacity to adapt and survive, and dangerously casual with the irreplaceable.</p> <p>When people fear for their jobs and livelihoods, worrying about woodlands and biodiversity might seem like self-indulgence. The management of the threat to the native ash of a lethal fungal infection first identified in Poland 20 years ago explains just why they matter. Forestry experts had long warned that climate change and the growth of plant imports could end up with more imported disease. But the attraction of plentiful plants and young trees from nurseries abroad outweighed such concern. The cost of such a disregard for biosecurity is what the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/uk-forests-unprecedented-threat-disease?CMP=twt_fd\" title=\"\">Forestry Commission is now calling</a> an \"unprecedented threat\" to some of Britain's most distinctive trees.</p> <p>Ash dieback is only the latest of a list that includes <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-8EJKP4\" title=\"\">Phytophthora ramorum</a>, another fungal infection that's destroying larches across Britain's west, and which may yet attack that symbol of Englishness, the oak. The prematurely dying leaves of chestnuts every late summer is a reminder of the inexorable spread of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/02/conservation.wildlife\" title=\"\">bleeding canker</a>, while unintentionally imported beetles, snails and moths <a href=\"http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/\" title=\"\">threaten fruit trees, pines and garden shrubs</a>. As an island, Britain has better natural defences than anywhere else in Europe, but complex EU trade law and a lack of political will militate against speedy reaction to new threats.</p> <p>We are already living with the consequences of earlier failures to give biosecurity the attention it needs. From the near past, a proper understanding of the extent of bovine TB would have made farmers more aware of the consequences of restocking with cattle from high-risk areas after <a href=\"http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/5541/\" title=\"\">the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001</a>. Eighteen months earlier, more consideration of the impact of an economic model that was based on ease of animal movement might have <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/273/1602/2729\" title=\"\">prevented the wildfire spread</a> of foot and mouth altogether.</p> <p>We cannot predict precisely the consequences of our casual assumption of&#xa0;man's limitless capacity to cope with environmental disaster. But it is plain that with each crisis, something is lost. Ash dieback merely threatens to be more highly visible than most. It should be recognised for the warning that it is: we are nature's custodians, not nature's masters.</p>",
  "<p>The sight of hawkers touting an array of tat to tourists on Brooklyn Bridge returned on Wednesday, in a sure sign that lower Manhattan was trying its hardest to get back to normal.</p> <p>After days of being deprived of the delights of New York City, overseas visitors were not going to let a shut-down subway deter them from getting close to the attractions they had travelled so far to see.</p> <p>In and around Manhattan's financial district tourists appeared to outnumber New Yorkers, most of whom had presumably opted to stay at home and wait out the power outage to office blocks and homes.</p> <p>The streets showed surprisingly few signs of the destruction visited upon it by the wind, rain and floodwater of super storm Sandy just 36 hours earlier.</p> <p>The odd window may be boarded up and the shops shuttered, but it is only when you look up and ponder the lack of lights that you notice a marked difference to familiar streets. That is until you look at those roaming around. Gone are the teams of suited fellows ferrying themselves to the office, lunch or meetings.</p> <p>Instead the only employees working are the construction workers, police and security guards. And with most of the food markets shuttered and without power, seemingly all those on duty had descended on the same outlet \u2013 Steve's Pizza on the edge of Zuccotti Park.</p> <p>A line of fluorescent jackets queued outside the outlet, situated just a stone's throw from the World Trade Center. Whoever Steve is, he's is likely to be a richer man tonight, given the brisk trade and seemingly inflated prices.</p> <p>\"Twenty-four bucks a pie, you're kidding me,\" moaned one customer. \"I haven't seen price like that for a long time\"</p> <p>Still he left with a slice in hand, as did his four colleagues. In the heart of the free market's spiritual home, supply and demand economics were still evident.</p> <p>Others had a different explanation for Steve's enterprising back-to-business approach.</p> <p>\"We have been pretty impressed with the resilience of New Yorkers,\" said Liz Alison, a tourist from Australia.</p> <p>She knows a thing or two about how cities cope in a crisis, having opted to visit Christchurch in February 2011, just as an earthquake devastated the New Zealand city.</p> <p>\"This is my second natural disaster in two years,\" she added, before heading off to find a bus to take her to Macy's.</p> <p>Other tourists were having a tougher time.</p> <p>On the Manhattan Bridge, Marie Malgram was not in the mood for sightseeing, nor did she have the time. Having arrived on Friday from Sweden with her nephew Casper, she had been hunkering down in Brooklyn over the last few days.</p> <p>The task facing her on Manhattan Bridge was working out a way to get to Newark Airport for her return flight that night.</p> <p>\"We hope to get a cab once we're on Manhattan, but we don't know.\" </p> <p>Some enterprising motorists were picking up pedestrians on the Brooklyn side of the bridge \u2013 for a price, of course \u2013 but Marie evidently hadn't seen them.</p> <p>Asked how the rest of the holiday had been, the 44-year-old Swede looked skyward and then to her teenage nephew, \"He managed to get some shopping in.\"</p> <p>Some of it was in the large luggage bags being dragged laboriously across the Manhattan Bridge. The drudgery of getting from point A to B would continue on the Manhattan side of the span.</p> <p>In Chinatown, the usually buzzing market day-like atmosphere was gone, with all but the odd hardware store operating, in darkness.</p> <p>A long line greeted the M103 bus as it pulled up to let passengers on.</p> <p>A woman at the front of the queue explained that she had been waiting for two hours. She was heading to midtown west, a journey she would have completed by foot in the time she had waited in line for a packed bus.</p> <p>Traffic on the bridges was heavy, but not the gridlock that many had predicted.</p> <p>City authorities had not gotten around to updating the less-than-cheery message greeting drivers heading to Manhattan.</p> <p>\"Stay off roads. Take shelter,\" it warned motorists in day-glow letters.</p> <p>Not that many Brooklynites were taking any notice in any account.</p> <p>Mixing it with the tourists were workers keen to check that their Manhattan places of work were in an okay state, and to escape going stir-crazy at home.</p> <p>\"I've been cooped up at home too long, I needed the exercise in any case,\" explained Amber McMillan, a 31-year-old director of an educational centre in the West Village.</p> <p>For others, it was the relentless wheels of America's legal system compelling them to cross the bridge.</p> <p>\"I gotta get a to court,\" explained a man who gave his name only as Pete. \"I got caught jumping the train.\"</p> <p>The irony of being unable to use public transport to appear at his probably postponed court day appeared lost on Pete as he hurdled the barrier separating the road from the bridge's walkway.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here shortly. In the meantime, here's Jamie Jackson's match preview:</p> <blockquote> <p>Roberto Di Matteo and Sir Alex Ferguson will make significant changes to their Chelsea and Manchester United sides for Wednesday evening's Capital One Cup tie at Stamford Bridge, where they meet three days after their controversial Premier League game.</p> <p>United's 3-2 win in west London was followed by Chelsea's official complaint that Mark Clattenburg, the referee, had aimed allegedly \"inappropriate\" language at Juan Mata and Mikel John Obi, with the club claiming that the latter was the target of a racial slur. Clattenburg denies the allegations.</p> <p>Although Chris Smalling is not yet fit enough to be in contention, he should be available for United's Champions League trip to Braga next Wednesday after the groin and metatarsal injuries that have ruled him out so far this season. Smalling's fellow central defender Phil Jones is yet to return to football training as he recovers from a knee problem.</p> <p>Ferguson told MUTV: \"We will try to push Chris on quickly. I don't think he will make Wednesday's game but I am sure he will be ready for the following week. There was some hope both he and Phil would be back for this busy schedule. Phil will be starting football training next Monday. He still has some running to do. The good news is they are not far away.\"</p> <p>After the visit to Stamford Bridge, United host Arsenal in Saturday's early kick-off, then fly to Portugal for their Champions League group game before travelling to Aston Villa the following Saturday.</p> <p>With this busy 10 days in mind, Ferguson will rest key players at Stamford Bridge. \"Obviously we will make changes for the Wednesday game,\" he said. \"The squad that played against Newcastle [United, in the previous round] will be in place again. You don't want to lose down there and we want to continue in the cup. Any game down there is going to be tough. There has been good progress there since Roberto Di Matteo took the job. They are big games \u2013 and big games are good for us.\"</p> <p>For the 2\u20111 win over Newcastle in late September, Ferguson handed full debuts to Michael Keane, Marnick Vermijl and Scott Wootton in a side completely different from United's previous outing, a 2-1 win at Liverpool.</p> <p>Di Matteo's challenge is to try to ensure his side retain focus following Sunday's post-match events. Although Mata and Mikel are in the match-day squad, the manager may elect to rest both. Di Matteo is also without the suspended John Terry, Fernando Torres and Branislav Ivanovic, and the injured Frank Lampard.</p> <p>\"We are looking to freshen the team up a little bit, for sure, and also put a couple of youngsters in,\" Di Matteo said. \"We always talk about developing and giving youngsters a chance so this type of game is a good opportunity for some of them.\"</p> <p>Daniel Sturridge, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and Lucas Piaz\u00f3n look certain to start. They could be joined by Victor Moses, Marko Marin, Oriol Romeu and Ryan Bertrand.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><br>If the last few days of Circus Football have taught us anything, it is that there is no point previewing matches. You could publish 45 mighty leather-clad volumes discussing facts, form and scenarios ahead of tonight's big game \u2013 and Chelsea and Manchester United could still contrive to serve up something you hadn't thought possible. Barmy errors, outrageous skill, breakneck attacking, inexplicable decisions, phenomenal comebacks, hilarious celebrations, racist storms, chauvinist showers, friendly whirlpools \u2013 we could get all or none of these tonight, and plenty more besides. Brace yourselves. </p> <p>Or, of course, we could get a torpid 0-0 draw, though even then we would still savour the drama of a penalty shoot-out because, as Olivier Giroud and Francis Coquelin now know, there are no replays in this here competition. There'll be treats tonight, then, and possibly lots to tricks too. </p> <p>Here is tonight's cast:</p> <p><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech, Azpilicueta, Cahill, Luiz, Bertrand, Romeu, Mikel, Moses, Mata, Piazon, Sturridge </p> <p><strong>United:</strong> Lindgaard, Rafael, Keane, Wooton, Buttner, Giggs, Anderson, Fletcher, Nani, Hernandez, Wellbeck </p> <p><strong>Person hoping this is the mention he gets:</strong> Lee Mason</p> <p><strong>Some footballers who should be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfxh_79HiQY\">playing tonight</a>:</strong> John Hellins, Peter Gorey, Paranormal Whiteside and ... you can do better, can't you? </p> <p>Before the game, let's all take a moment to laugh at Nails McCluskey, an Arsenal-crazed chum of mine \u2026. who missed last night's extravaganza at the Madejski because he locked himself in a car park. It is right and just to bring this to wider attention.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.42pm: United fans have just unfurled a large banner reading: \"Clattenberg, Referee, Leader, Legend\". There'll be needle in this game and no mistake. Meanwhile, Ally Fogg recommends \"Andy Witchie\" as a participant in tonight's proceedings.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> And they're off: and at a cracking pace to boot. The United fans are belting chants about John Terry which, alas, cannot be repeated here for legal reasons and so on.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> United have settled quicker, looking more comfortable with the high tempo. Even Andersen has just accelerated past Mikel ... before being curtailed by David Luiz, who launches a counter-attack and then, since no one comes to challenge him, decides to unleash the game's first shot. He wellies it way over from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Fletcher gives the ball away to Sturridge, who tears towards the Chelsea backline ... but then loses his cool and attempts a rash pass to Mata. Interception. \"How about Jurgen Pumpkinsmann?\" howls Gary Naylor. \"Actually, that's terrible, isn't it?\" Yes, it is, Gary, but perhaps its very ghastliness makes it the most appropriate suggestion of all?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> There's only one thing to say about what has just happened: hahahahahahahahahaha! You see, Moses found Sturridge with a wonderful pass from the right and the striker, having eluded the United defence, took it down 15 yards from goal ... and then fell over! \"Are you Torres in disguise?\" crow the United fans. It really was that bad.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> It's pleasingly helter-skelter. THe quality is not especially high so far but you can feel that the stakes are. Meanwhile, Eddie Munro recommends two more United legends who could do with an outing tonight: \"Neal Webb and Jonathan Spectre.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> The first booking of the game goes to Romeu, for a lazy trip on Buttner. In other news, I'm glad so many emailers picked up on the fact that Andy Witchie played for United. Just, um, making sure you're paying attention. \"Instead of Keey Dixon, how about Scary Vixen?\" contorts Justin Kavanagh. \"He would surely be a bewitching striker for Chelsea. Especially in that all-black Chelsea away strip.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Decent interplay betwene MOses and Azpilicueta down the right before the Nigerian is penalised for being blocked off by Welbeck, which seems harsh. \"Here's one: Mark FrankenStein,\" bellows Huw Alexander. \"I'll get my broomstick.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Easy save for Cech from a Welbeck shot from 16 yards. United, though, still look marginally more dangerous than the hosts.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> A foxy flick from Bertrand, followed by another by Sturridge and suddenly Moses is racing into the box with only Wooton to beat ... and then he too falls over! Has someone put a hex on Chelsea's players? \"How about Fright Yorke partnering Andy Ghoul, against Dan Ceausescu and Mario Satani\u0107?\" Top marks to G Ujang.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Romeu, who is already on a yellow, concedes a freekick by tripping Nani about 30 yards from goal. If he were daring the ref to send him off, that's pretty much how he'd go about it. Lee Mason decides to be lenient.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 0-1 United (Giggs 22')</strong> The farce begins! Cech rolls a short goalkick to Romeu on the edge of the area. Giggs and Andersen immediately converge on the midfielder, who coughs up the ball to allow Giggs to rifle it into the net from 18 yards!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Chelsea fans vent their derision at the ref after he waves play on when Piazon is shunted to the ground on the edge of the United box by Rafael.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Mikel is booked for a late trip on Welbeck. It was a thoroughly justified decision but such is the ire of the locals that they immediately begin bellowing \"You're worse than Clattenberg\". They sure know how to endear themselves to officials down at the Bridge.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Splendid skill by Welbeck on the left, dinking the ball over one opponents and then reverse-flicking it past another. He really is a deceptively fine player.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Penalty! An easy decision for Mason as Buttner clatters into the impressive Moses, who was making another burst into the box.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 1-1 United (David Luiz pen, 31')</strong> Spot-on spotkick from the Brazilian, who hammered the ball low and hard into the corner. Lindegaard went the right way and got a touch to it but the shot was struck with too much power for him to stop it.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Mikel flights a long ball over the top. Sturridge again gets away from the United defence to collect it ... and then shows a distinct lack of composure to smash the ball wildly into the stands. He had time and space to do virtually anything but instead demonstrated that his decision-making is seriously in need of improvement. Meanwhile, here's another Halloween footballer: \"Dark Mata?\" proposes the cosmic-minded J Kadlard</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> The ref orders a short break in play for reasons that Sky do not want to tell us about: the fact that some stewards at the United end are looking quite agitated suggests there may be some manner of mayhem afoot ... in fact, there are now claims on twitter that fireworks were thrown. Let's hope nothing more sinister develops.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Order appears to have been restored in the stands, and play resumes, with Welbeck firing in another shot from 20 yards. But again it was not good enough to trouble Cech.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> David Luiz, for once eschewing the complicated, smashes the ball miles out of play as Hernandez closed in on him. \"It's less fun than riffing on Halloween puns (Rafae-Hell?), but surely Buttner's immediate finger wagging denial of a clear penalty is trying to con the ref in exactly the same way that divers are trying to con the ref?\" Matt Dony, who may not have a firm grasp of the meaning of 'exactly' but has a point all the same. \"Where's the high-horse brigade on that?\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 1-2 United (Hernandez 42')</strong> This time David Luiz spurned the straight-forward ... and coughed up possession on the half-way line. United punished him emphatically, with Hernandez showcasing his lethal predatory skills again, taking Nani's pass with one sure touch before firing past Cech from the edge of the box. Give him an inch and he'll take a goal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> Moses again rips down the right and delivers a cross that United divert behind for a corner. But it comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> It's been frantic. Two Halloween howlers have helped United take the lead but Chelsea have flickered - notably through Moses - and there's plenty of sparks left in this one. \"Regarding Matt Dony's point [39 mins],\" blurts Rob Edwards. \"Does he mean exactly the same way in which every player in the Premier League ever claims for a throw in? It's a CHEATING EPIDEMIC I TELL YOU!\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Substitutions: </strong>Powell is on for United instead of Buttner (apparently because he has picked up a knock, and not, then, because he was being given the run-around by Moses), so Rafael is going to left-back and Fletcher will try his luck at right-back. Chelsea, meanwhile, have replaced Mikel with Ramires.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Powell makes an immediate impression, collecting a ball from Anderson about 25 yards out, then making space for a shot and tonking in a low swirler that Cech pushes awkwardly behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Sturridge, Sturridge, Sturridge! Usually he is too hasty but this time, after being put through by Mata, he was guilty of taking far too long to do anything useful, leisurely trying to manouevre the ball on to his left so that he could pick his spot from eight yards. United got back to stick the ball out for a corner; then they dawdled as Chelsea took a quick one ... and now Sturridge was back to his usual rashness, attempting an extravagant flick from six yards when he had enough time to control the ball and bang it into the net. At this rate, Torres will remain the most effective striker at Stamford Bridge, which is alarming. \"Twitter claims that some United fans are flying the banner 'Chelsea - standing up to racism since last Sunday',\" notes Peter McMurry. \"Please, please tell me this is true.\" I've not seen it, Peter, my vantage point in a bunker several miles from the stadium restricting my view to what Sky want to show me.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2-2 United (Cahill 51')</strong> Perhaps Chelsea should stick Cahill up front instead of Torres and Sturridge? That's his fifth goal of the season, coming courtesy of a powerful header from a corner. Rafael tried to keep it out but he was behind the line when he connected with it and the referee rightly awarded the goal.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Chelsea substitution: </strong>Piazon off, Hazard on.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Mata and Hazard combine in familiar fashion before the Belgian slips the ball through to the overlapping Bertrand. Lindegaard dives to cut out his dangerous low cross.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2-3 United (Nani 59')</strong> A beautiful goal, created and converted by Nani! The Portuguese winger initiated a counter-attack with some flamboyant skill in his own half and then arrived at the end of the move to swap a slick one-two with Hernandez and then dink the ball over the out-rushing Cech.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Play is hurtling from one end to the other and at this point you would not totally rule out a repeat of last night's 12-goal fiesta at the Madejski. Hernandez, in fact, should have added the sixth of the game after being teed up just now by Anderson, but he smashed the ball over from the edge of the box. Give him an inch, and he might take a goal, then. \"<a href=\"http://www.balls.ie/football/another-man-united-banner-attacking-chelsea/#sthash.f9c0vzOA.X0YY7lDQ.dpbs\">Here's a picture of that banner</a> for Peter mcMurry,\" offers friendly Liam Godinho.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Wootton booked for clonking into Sturridge on half-way.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Azpilicueta, who has shown tremendous enterprise from right-back, plays a snappy one-two with Mata before a shot is deflected out for a corner. Chelsea take it short and then cross towards the penalty spot, where Moses heads inches over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Chelsea play their way from back to front with sweet passing and movement, and then Ramires goes and bogs the ball way wide from 20 yards. Meanwhile, for those who care, Gareth Bale has put Spurs 1-0 up at Norwich, while Swansea lead by the same score at Anfield thanks to Chico.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> A great chance missed! Mata jinked his way to the by-line and then clipped the ball to the back post, where Azpilicueta arrived at speed .... and headed over!</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> The League Cup matters to Roberto Di Matteo: he proves that by withdrawing Romeu and throwing on Oscar, meanign the Tricky Trio is now intact.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Chelsea cry for a penalty but the ref turns them down! The ball clearly hit the defender's arm from Mata's attempted shot but the official seemingly ruled that it was inadvertent. We'll get a replay if there is a break in play, which could be a while given how fast this match is careering from one end to the other...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Oscar lets fly from from 20 yards and the ball goes high and wide, which gives u a chance to have another look at the penalty appeal: sure enough, Mata's shot hit Keane's arm, which was positioned in a way that made that outcome probable.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Another fine move by Chelsea, who are chasing the equaliser with giddy abandon. Bertrand plays in Sturridge, who cuts it back for Moses, who lashes a low shot at goal from 12 yards .... well held by Linedegaard.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> A wayward pass by Sturridge allows United to relieve pressure and raid forward. When they get there, Giggs shows the sort of composure that Sturridge badly lacks and slows play down. United circulate the ball at their leisure ... before Anderson attempts to thread a cunning pass through to Welbeck. Cahill just gets a toe to it to abort the danger.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> After Welbeck narrowly fails to meet a Rafael cross, United make another change, taking off Anderson, who has had a fine game, and introducing Tunnicliffe.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> A little shuffle from Hazard fools Wootton, who blunders into the Belgian to concede a freekick about three yards outside the box (but Wootton avoids a second booking). Mata curls a reasonable effort over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> United are having to resist a gathering storm; Lindegaard makes another save, this time from Sturridge following a slinky backheel tee-up by Hazard.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Lovely effort by Oscar, well parried by Lindegaard. With a quick shimmy the Brazilian made room for a shot and then dispatched a swirler from 25 yards, but the keeper kept his focus and batted it away. Meanwhile, Norwich have equalised against Spurs thanks to an own goal by Vertonghen.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Chelsea keep coming. And they keep missing, this time Cahill booming over after decent work by Oscar. Meanwhile at Carrow Road, Simeon Jackson has put Norwich 2-1 up against Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> \"Time to blame the referee!\" chant the traveling fans.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Tunnicliffe throws himself in front of a Mata shot to preserve his team's lead. But Chelsea regain possession and come again.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be at least three more minutes, which, if last night is anything to go by, could mean anything. At Anfield, meanwhile, there is unlikely to be extra-time as Nathan Dyer has put Swansea 2-0 up. It really is looking like a good night for United fans ...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> David Luiz booked for showing excessive zeal - or downright ineptitude - in his attempt to dispossess Hernandez.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Penalty! With the ball bouncing aroudn the United box, Ramires seemed set to spin and shoot ... but Wootton barged him over!</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 3-3 United (Hazard pen, 90+4')</strong> It was never going to end on time, was it? Hazard coolly strokes the ball down the middle as Lindegaard flops to his left. Cue extra-time (during which United will have 11 men, as Wootton again escapes a second yellow).</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>ET 1:</strong> The show continues. Chelsea zip the ball around nicely for the first minute. With the momentum in their favour and most of their first-team on the pitch, the home side must be favourites to prevail here. But you'd be a fool to bet on that.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>ET 3 min:</strong> Apparently all this excitement is too much for my email system, which has now crashed. So don't bother sending me anything, unless it's abuse, of which you can spew as much as you want while I can't read it. In other news, Sturridge's decision-making is not improving: after beating Lindegaard to a through-ball, he could have crossed to a team-mate in the centre who would have had a great chance to score, but instead he went for a shot himself from a preposterous angle. You know how that story ended.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>ET 5 min:</strong> Federico Macheda is still at Manchester United. I know this because the camera has just shown him warming up. Looks like he's going to replace Welbeck, who seems to be in some discomfort.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 4-3 United (Sturridge ET 7')</strong> Give him 10 chances and he'll make you pay! A botched back-header by Wootton presented the ball to Sturridge and this time the striker finished with class, putting the keeper down with a sly feint and then rolling the ball into the net. Chelsea are in front for the first time.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>ET 9 min:</strong> A skirmish breaks out between Oscar and Nani, featuring all the classic ingredients of a football fight: shoving, stropping and general half-arsery. The ref rightly books them both.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>ET 11 min:</strong> Giggs, still going strong in the 100th minute and his 100th year, chases back to dispossess Mata just as the Spaniard shaped to shoot. United tear forward but the move founders on Macheda.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>ET 13 min:</strong> Cahill the Goal Machine malfunctions, flashing a header narrowly wide from a Mata freekick. Elsehwere, De Guzman has made it 3-1 to Swansea at Anfield. The holders are about to be chucked out.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>ET 15 min:</strong> Keane booked for pulling over Sturridge as the striker broke clear. Why that wasn't a red card I don't know. Chelsea will attempt to dispense justice from a freekick ... and it's a quite brilliant effort from David Luiz! He sent a freakish wobbler over the ball and it crashes against the crossbar! And that's the last kick of the first half of extra-time.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>ET 17 min:</strong> Chelsea launch a lightning break, which concludes with Sturridge thundering a shot fractionally over the bar from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>ET 19 min:</strong> Chelsea stream forward again. Sturridge takes the wrong option again, sending an ill-advised shot high and wide when well-placed team-mates were soliciting a pass.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>ET 21 min:</strong> Tunnicliffe catches Sturridhe-itis and goes for a flash volley from the edge of the area. Way, way over it goes.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>ET 22 min:</strong> Moses spurns a chance to kill United off! Sturridge, it should be noted, set up the opportunity with a well-chosen and well-executed pass, then Moses took it down and fired at goal from 12 yards. But Lindegaard scrambled it away with his feet.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>ET 24 min:</strong> Ramires sees yellow after a lunge on Keane.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 5-3 United (Ramires ET 25')</strong> Chelsea cleared a Giggs corner and suddenly launched forward through Hazard, who played in Ramires and the Brazilian finished beautifully. With a shuffle he laid down Lindegaard and then walked past him and slotted the ball into the net. That should settle it.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>ET 28 min:</strong> Giggs gets yellow for a frustrated boot at Moses.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>ET 29 min:</strong> Penalty to United! Perhaps things aren't settled! It was the right decision again by the ref, Azpilicueta having clumped into Hernandez.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 5-4 United (Giggs pen ET 29')</strong> Giggs sends Cech the wrong way to score and set up who knows what.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>ET 30 min:</strong> There will be at least two more minutes.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> The mayhem end, Hazard hitting the post with the last kick of an exhilarating game. Ultimately the introduction of Hazard, Oscar and Ramires turned the game in Chelsea's favour, giving them too much quality for an under-strength United side who nonetheless contributed largely to a delightfully entertaining game. Not too sure what the point of the League Cup is but it's proving great fun ... which, of course, should be the only point that matters.</p>",
  "<p>Spurs, their supporters believed, were on their way to Wembley and until the last 10 minutes of this match, so it seemed. Having had a considerable majority of possession, the Londoners were looking comfortable when Gareth Bale put them ahead halfway through the second half.</p> <p>It was then, however, that manager Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, as he often does, made an essentially defensive change, sending on Jan Vertonghen for Tom Carroll, and not for the first time this season, it backfired spectacularly. While the Belgian defender could hardly be blamed for inadvertently deflecting Alex Tettey's shot into his own goal, the teams' momentum had already begun to change.</p> <p>Suddenly it was all Norwich, and Simeon Jackson then seized on Grant Holt's header to put Norwich ahead from close range. It is worth noting that Tettey, Jackson and Holt were all attacking substitutions. Even then Spurs had a glorious chance to take the game into extra-time, but Clint Dempsey saw his 88th-minute penalty superbly saved by Norwich goalkeeper Mark Bunn, and the result is that Norwich are in the quarter-finals of this competition for the first time for 18 years.</p> <p>Villas-Boas brushed aside suggestions that his negativity might have been a factor. \"If I'd brought on attackers you can be punished in the same way. I put Jan into midfield, where he has experience playing, just to give a little bit more freshness and to equal Norwich's height, because we anticipated they would bring on Holt.</p> <p>\"It's a pity to see the game slip from our hands and we're disappointed. When it comes to conceding late goals we have to do better: it's something in our mind and we are working on it.\"</p> <p>In beating Arsenal and having the best of a draw at Aston Villa in their previous two games, Norwich had shown they are capable of recreating the level of performance which kept them up last season. Whether they will go on to do so consistently remains to be seen, and in that respect Chris Hughton might almost have preferred to see his side play well and lose unluckily than play badly and scrape through; but the Norwich manager still made a full 10 changes.</p> <p>Villas-Boas was relatively restrained, his seven alterations not necessarily those predicted. That Bale and Dempsey started suggested the Spurs manager was taking this competition rather more seriously than his predecessor. Under Harry Redknapp, Spurs had gone out at the first hurdle in the last two seasons.</p> <p>Judging by the large number who had made the journey up from London, the Spurs supporters clearly shared the Portuguese's opinion, and they can only have been optimistic after a first half which, if disappointing in terms of the number of chances created, ended with their team very much on top.</p> <p>The only semblance of a Norwich chance fell to Morison, or would have done if his lack of pace running on to Andrew Surman's through-ball had not allowed Kyle Walker time to get back and make the tackle.</p> <p>Bale, first turning Jake Livermore's low cross just wide, and soon afterwards shooting into the side-netting, went closest to scoring, and the second half was following a similar pattern until the Wales flyer was allowed to run across the front of the Norwich penalty area before firing a low right-footed drive inside Bunn's right-hand post.</p> <p>Then came the substitutions. Vertonghen's presence did make a difference, but not in the way Villas-Boas had hoped. With Tettey's shot going outside the post, the Belgian instinctively put out a foot and deflected it past Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal.</p> <p>The excitement was just beginning. Two minutes later Holt won a header and Jackson, having seen his initial shot blocked by Lloris, prodded the rebound home. Even then Spurs had the perfect chance to equalise but Bunn dived to his left to block Dempsey's firmly struck penalty, given for Marc Tierney's foul on Walker.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you need a little fortune, and the first goal was clearly a deflection, but we haven't had one of those all season,\" said Hughton. \"As for the substitutions, sometimes you have to try and force the issue, and it had been a cagey game until they scored. I just wanted to bring a little energy into our game. \"</p>",
  "<p>We do not know what David Cameron discussed on the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/110328/cameron_rt-hon-david.htm\" title=\"\">free helicopter flights</a> he accepted in the runup to the election from Noble Foods, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/29/workers-chickens-allegedly-trafficked-beaten\" title=\"\">Happy Egg company</a>, which this week turned out to be using Lithuanian workers allegedly kept in conditions of slavery. In any case, there would have been plenty of other opportunities for the company's chairman, Peter Dean, a key Tory party donor, to discuss the importance of cheap, flexible labour with&#xa0;the Conservatives. Noble Foods <a href=\"https://pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk/search/searchintro.aspx\" title=\"\">gave \u00a350,000 to the Tories</a> last year alone. That is the magic figure that gets&#xa0;you <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Donate/Donor_Clubs.aspx\" title=\"\">dinner with David Cameron.</a> It&#xa0;must feel like happy eggs all round now, with the coalition's charge to remove the \"red tape\" of labour rights that is a such \"burden on business\".</p> <p>And while the Conservatives may talk&#xa0;tough on immigration, make no mistake, they are anything but tough on&#xa0;the causes of immigration. Their policies are one key driver of it.</p> <p>Why, when unemployment among the young and unskilled here is so high,&#xa0;do companies like Noble Foods need to turn to foreign workers supplied&#xa0;by gangmasters? The description of the life&#xa0;led by the Lithuanians who were liberated into the care of the <a href=\"http://www.soca.gov.uk/about-soca/about-the-ukhtc\" title=\"\">UK Human Trafficking Centre</a> earlier this month might offer a clue.</p> <p>They told how they were shuttled, in mini-vans, the length and breadth of the country, often sleeping in the vehicles between working shifts of up to 17 hours on farms contracted to Noble. Much of this type of work happens at night, a few hours here and a back-to-back double shift there. The flexible workforce big business says it needs is one they like to be able to turn on and off as easily as a tap.</p> <p>Few people other than recent migrants can tolerate conditions of this sort for long. They are incompatible with any sort of ordered, decent family life. The pay is rarely enough to live on. The Agricultural Wages Board set rural pay slightly higher than the minimum wage and made sure workers received basic sick pay and protection at work. The government wants to abolish it. More than 150,000 low-income workers will be directly affected, another 100,000 indirectly.</p> <p>Small farmers don't want to see the board go. They hate having to conduct individual negotiations with seasonal workers, and want a level playing field on which everyone is obliged to pay properly. It is the larger producers and agribusiness that are lobbying to get rid of it. When pay is too low to live on, local people are forced out, leaving a gap to be filled by those who are more desperate from elsewhere. Immigration becomes the wages policy, with government actually promoting its increase.</p> <p>The Gangmaster Licensing Authority has survived the bonfire of the quangos, but only just. Set up with support across the political spectrum after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Morecambe_Bay_cockling_disaster\" title=\"\">23 cockle pickers drowned in Morecambe Bay</a> in 2004, it was never funded sufficiently to carry out the level of inspection and enforcement needed to eradicate labour abuse. The sectors it covered were illogically restricted to food processing and agriculture, rather than including all those areas in which migrant labour dominates, such as catering, hotel work, construction and care homes. Labour was wedded to the flexible workforce too. But the coalition government will have slashed the GLA's already meagre resources by nearly a fifth by the end of&#xa0;this parliament.</p> <p>In response to complaints from agribusiness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/05/gangmasters-watchdog-defra-licensing-authority\" title=\"\">it has instructed the GLA</a> to be \"lighter in its touch\" when it regulates and inspects. Providing gangs of vulnerable migrant workers you don't have to bother to pay properly to factories and farms has got easier. Life for those who want to operate legally, providing decent jobs, filled by the sort of workers who know their rights and are not so easy to exploit, has got harder. Once again, tough when it comes to rhetoric on immigration, lax on the regulation that might remove the conditions driving it.</p> <p>It was turning a blind eye to the flouting of another bit of regulation, the Sunday trading laws, that marked a turning point in economic migration from eastern Europe to the UK in the early 1990s. Big supermarkets started opening illegally on Sundays, knowing local authorities would not have the bottle or resources to take them on. They succeeded in making a change to the law \u2013 which was opposed by unions and church groups \u2013 a fait accompli.</p> <p>Touring factories, I have often been told by directors that the switch to seven-day trading with accompanying \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/06/just-in-time-business-model-disaster-risk\" title=\"\">just-in-time</a>\" ordering forced them to restructure their workforce. Where, in the past, local people had worked five days a week and enjoyed being able to supplement their incomes with overtime payments for evening and weekend work, that was no longer enough to meet supermarket demands. They had to run 24/7; it was migrants who filled the much longer unsocial hours. The Conservatives want to relax Sunday trading laws further. Ask their voters if they want longer shopping hours, and no doubt many would say yes. Tell them it could mean more migration and you might get a different answer.</p> <p>Each year the government says it wants to close down schemes, such as&#xa0;the seasonal agricultural workers programme, that allow foreign workers&#xa0;to come into sectors that need&#xa0;low-skill labour, to curb immigration and help British workers. Each year industry argues that it needs them, and&#xa0;they are reopened.</p> <p>The Conservative stance on Croatian accession to the EU next year is dog-whistle shrill. It wants restrictions to prevent access to the UK labour market by Croatian nationals. Few are likely to come, as they have much stronger ties with Germany. But why miss an opportunity to grandstand to your anti-immigration heartlands?</p> <p>The more noise made about foreign workers, the easier it is to distract people from the fact that the best way to keep British jobs is to preserve employment protection and enforce the law.</p>",
  "<p>Your article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/26/government-building-standards-review-regulation\" title=\"\">Bonfire of the building rules</a>, 27 October) shows the deadly nature of this government's neoliberal obsession with slashing the regulations that protect us all, claiming without a shred of evidence that it is \"health and safety gone mad\" and \"strangling red tape\" that is killing jobs, rather than their wrong-headed economic policies.</p> <p>Even construction companies do not think this is a good idea. Morally and practically allowing shoddy, unsafe buildings that will leak energy, be fire traps and inaccessible to disabled people to \"stimulate the economy\" is insane. It is a bizarre move after the success of the Olympics that gave the economy such a boost, the building of which was accomplished without any deaths due to ensuring strict compliance with construction and health and safety regulations, brought about by co-operation between unions, construction companies, and the HSE. The construction industry still has a very high rate of worker deaths at almost one per week, and also kills a number of members of the public, and cannot be trusted to self-regulate. This government's deadly obsession with deregulation is shameful and mendacious, and likely to lead to many more disasters such as Piper Alpha or Lakanal House, without creating a single extra job, boosting house building, or kick-starting the economy. <br><strong>Hilda Palmer</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Greater Manchester Hazards Centre</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 No one is suggesting homes be allowed that are structurally unsound or energy inefficient. What is proposed is a sensible roll-back of the excessive regulatory burden that has been progressively heaped upon the construction industry over the last 15 years to the point where it is no longer worth building. Many of the latest requirements are unnecessary, absurd, complicated and hugely expensive out of all proportion to any long-term gain. The worst excesses of these unbridled obligations in the building regulations, and more particularly the planning system, must be curtailed. Otherwise there will be no mass housebuilding programme by the private sector and consequently no national economic recovery.<br><strong>Matthew Laverack</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 We have building regulations for good reason. The first unified system was the London Building Acts of 1667, drawn up after the Great Fire to prevent the spread of fire and the untimely collapse of buildings. Administered by district surveyors, subsequent acts lasted until 1986 when Margaret Thatcher abolished the GLC. Self-regulation, which appears to be proposed under this new review, has, as the past has shown, brought disaster after disaster, from Aberfan to Ronan Point, from the Summerland fire to the Kings Cross underground tragedy.</p> <p>Health and safety in the building industry is there for a purpose. Building is a very dangerous trade. Until the construction, design and management regulations 2007, there was no obligation for any building firm to provide the welfare facilities that any office worker takes for granted. Ricky Tomlinson, Des Warren and the Shrewsbury pickets were jailed for campaigning for those basic standards 40 years ago. Does the government really intend to take us back to the good old days of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists?<br><strong>Sam Webb</strong><br><em>Canterbury, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is less than two years since the government undertook an identical review. Similarly, the initial review sought evidence on ways to improve the building regulations, on reducing the regulatory burdens and on delivering rather better levels of compliance. The results of that investigation, published in December 2010, can still be found on the Department for Community's website. This states clearly that \"the key theme to emerge has been that the regime is generally fit-for-purpose, but that there are things that can be improved\".</p> <p>A new programme was introduced with \"a particular focus on deregulation and streamlining of the technical and procedural aspects of the regulations\". The same response undertook to confirm detailed proposals to improve the energy standards both for new and existing buildings by the end of October 2012, with a view to their coming into force next April. There is as yet no sign of&#xa0;any of these. Rather than convening yet another strategic review, what would be of far more use would be for the government to keep their promises, and get on with implementing these very necessary improvements.<br><strong>Andrew Warren</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.ukace.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Association for the Conservation of Energy</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 The government scheme for growth driven by the deregulation of building controls should adequately insure owners against the consequences. Since National House Building Council \"Buildmark\" insurance requires owners to pay approximately the first \u00a31,300 of each claim, disappointed owners of defective deregulated homes will eventually pay dearly. As NHBC only pays out for defects that breach NHBC building standards, will these standards join the bonfire as well?<br><strong>Roger Sutcliffe</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article about changing the building regulations mentions in passing last month's announcement about a free-for-all in house extensions as if this is really happening. The fact is that it won't happen, for two reasons: it would require a change in the law (prime ministerial diktat is not yet sufficient!); and local planning authorities will not implement it.</p> <p>As for the review of building regulations, this will take some time, putting action beyond the next election, and anyway the people doing the review will eventually realise that most of the provisions are important and necessary, and will produce an edited version with much the same real content.</p> <p>Another relevant point of course is that neither of these changes, in the unlikely event that they do happen, will automatically apply to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, unless the devolved administrations choose to take action.<br><strong>Douglas Simpson</strong><br><em>Todmorden, West Yorkshire</em></p>",
  "<p>A college gymnasium in late October; lines of eager voters stretched around the building; bunting and American flags inside the hall; sauna-like conditions under the hot television lights and a political candidate exhorting his most passionate supporters to vote on election day.</p> <p>This all-too-familiar autumnal scene was in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 11 days before American voters to go to the polls to choose their next president. The candidate was vice-president Joe Biden and it was a rite of passage that happens every four years in swing states across America. Biden's campaign event is the traditional and often most public element of this nation's seemingly unending quadrennial presidential races.</p> <p>But there is of course another story. It's one that goes on behind the scenes: the nuts and bolts of getting supporters the polls and persuading the small number of undecided voters to pick your candidate. Millions of voters are being pushed to cast their ballots early, the get out the vote (GOTV) operations of both campaigns has taken on a heightened sense of importance.</p> <p>In few places is that GOTV effort more pressing than Wisconsin \u2013 a state where Barack Obama trounced John McCain by 14 points in 2008, but in the previous two elections was won by John Kerry and Al Gore by the narrowest of margins. It's also a state that has been witness to a GOP resurgence, with five major elections in the state since 2010 \u2013 most of them won by Republicans.</p> <p>This year the polls have given Obama a narrow but persistent lead, but with a Wisconsin favorite son on the ballot \u2013 Paul Ryan \u2013 and a popular Republican governor, the Obama campaign is taking no chances. The president will hold an event in Green Bay on Thursday, one of his first campaign stops since hurricane Sandy stalled electioneering. Bill Clinton campaigned here for him on Wednesday, and Biden arrives on Friday. With less than a week until election day, therace for Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes has taken on unexpected urgency.</p> <p>So the Guardian dropped in on campaign offices and local rallies for both Obama and Mitt Romney in and around the south-eastern part of the state to try and get a sense of what is happening on the ground in Wisconsin and how it might affect the outcome on 6 November.</p> <h2>Obama's intimidating ground game</h2> <p>The ground game is the great unknown of the 2012 election \u2013 in trying to judge it properly one is forced invariably to rely on the confident predictions and massaged data of campaign staffers as well as what is visible, anecdotally, to the naked eye.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398656411\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/19/1350666913755/Barack-Obama-006.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama shakes hands with supporters at George Mason University, in Fairfax, Virginia. Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, what one can say with some certainty is that if Obama's ground game looks anything like it did in 2008, the president should be in pretty good shape. That year he put together what was arguably the best campaign infrastructure ever built for a presidential race \u2013 out-organizing and out-mobilizing his Democratic primary opponent Hilary Clinton and later the hapless John McCain in the general election.</p> <p>In an oft-cited campaign post-mortem, Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver, concluded that Obama's huge number of campaign offices, while not decisive, almost certainly expanded Obama's popular and electoral vote advantage and may have been single-handedly responsible for him winning three states on election day: Florida, North Carolina and Indiana.</p> <p>For a campaign focused on getting as many infrequent voters to the polls as possible \u2013 particularly young people, minorities and occasional voters \u2013 such efforts have the potential be as decisive in 2012 as they were in 2008.</p> <p>And from all appearances, while the GOP ground game has certainly improved since 2008, the infrastructure developed by Obama might be even better than it was four years ago \u2013 driven not only by years of preparation, but also a data-driven approach that has revolutionized how campaigns identify voters and craft micro-target messaging to get them to the polls.</p> <p>While it is virtually impossible to glean with any certainty the strength of the Obama ground game simply by walking into campaign offices, a few things did stand out in Wisconsin \u2013 and they are consistent with what others are reporting around the country. What is most obviously striking is the Obama effort's sheer ubiquity. The campaign is everywhere, with five offices in Milwaukee alone and seven in the surrounding country and suburbs. In all, the Obama campaign has 69 offices across the state.</p> <p>The Romney campaign, by comparison, lists 24 offices on their website. As was the case in 2008 this advantage is being replicated in swing states across the country. In Ohio, Obama has 131 outposts, compared to 40 from Romney; in Florida the edge is 106 to 47.</p> <p>Obama's outposts in and around Milwaukee were generally located on prominent street corners with large storefronts and visible signage. While I saw few volunteers during my visits (they were supposedly out canvassing) every office had numerous paid staff. The Romney effort on the other hand appears to depend more heavily on volunteer co-ordinators and local state party operatives.</p> <p>Moreover, while the Obama offices are focused on supporting all state candidates, it was a struggle to find the campaign paraphernalia of other Wisconsin Democrats under the onslaught of Obama-themed posters and placards. In one office located in a predominately Hispanic section of the city \u2013 with Latinos for Obama signs in the windows \u2013 even the bathroom was festooned with inspirational statements from the president.</p> <p>There was a remarkable similarity to look and feel of the Obama offices. It was like I had stumbled upon the McDonald's of campaign ground games. For example, the same large white paper scripts for how to talk to voters were pasted to the walls in several of the offices. And in keeping with the Obama campaign's approach of using peer pressure to get out the vote, one of the more revelatory lines in the script was a sentence that read: \"We are talking to a lot of people in [community name] and it looks like lots of your neighbors will be voting in this election.\"</p> <p>The other great similarity at the Obama offices was the complete fear of staff to actually speak with a reporter. When I told staffers that I was doing a story for the Guardian about the Obama ground game in Wisconsin I was met with often terror-stricken looks and a flat refusal to talk to me even on background. </p> <p>\"I don't want to get fired,\" said more than one staffer \u2013 a tribute, I suppose, to the Obama campaign's discipline. In one office, a staffer, apparently concerned that I was a Republican operative, demanded that I leave.</p> <h2>Romney's Wisconsin advantage</h2> <p>Things were a bit different on the Romney side of things (at the very least volunteers and staffers were far more willing to talk to me). While most observers credit the Romney campaign with a stronger ground effort than that of 2008 loser John McCain you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks it's on a par with Obama's. In fact, Romney doesn't really have a ground game. </p> <p>As Molly Ball reported in the Atlantic last week, he's largely outsourced GOTV responsibilities to the Republican national committee and in particular state GOP efforts \u2013 a fact that was clearly evident in Wisconsin.</p> <p>Still this might be Romney's biggest asset here.</p> <p>The reason lies in the badger state's constant stream of elections since 2010. That year Republicans won big, with Tea Party darling Ron Johnson taking the Senate seat from incumbent Russ Feingold and Scott Walker winning the governor's race.</p> <p>Walker quickly unveiled a plan to strip collective bargaining rights from Wisconsin public sector unions, a move that led to large protests at the state capitol in Madison and polarized an electorate that was already very narrowly divided. Walker's union ploy led to a host of recall elections by embittered Democrats including most controversially a recall race in June, which the well-financed Walker won handily.</p> <p>These one-after-the-other races left a sizable infrastructure in place as well as a battle-ready base of Republicans. It's an infrastructure that has quickly mobilized in support of Romney.</p> <p>According to Ben Sparks, Wisconsin communications director for the Romney-Ryan campaign the cumulative effect of winning the recall and then the selection of local congressman Paul Ryan as Romney's running mate has energized the state's Republican voters. </p> <p>\"Enthusiasm has been growing since 2010,\" said Sparks. \"Republicans have been bolstered from victory to victory and Democrats are demoralized. That excitement will be key to Romney's winning on election day.\"</p> <p>That enthusiasm was evident among local Republicans; and as was the sense of doom and gloom over the possibility of an Obama re-election. When I spoke with Obama supporters they talked about their desire to back the president and as one put it, \"keep things going\" with Obama. Women voters in particular stressed the president's views on reproductive health and pay equity \u2013 a key feature of his campaign's closing message.</p> <p>For Republicans, however, they were far more likely to see this campaign in existential terms. As Senator Johnson said in an appearance in a campaign office in a leafy suburb along the north shore of Milwaukee: \"This election is about saving America.\" A volunteer in the campaign's Waukesha office named Keith Best said an Obama win would be a \"tipping point\" moving the country toward \"socialism and the end of the free market\" in America.</p> <p>Still, while Romney supporters were clearly highly motivated, it appeared \u2013 at least anecdotally \u2013 that their campaign infrastructure couldn't quite measure up to that of Obama's.</p> <p>Take the Waukesha office for example. This is prime GOP territory: an area that is overwhelmingly Republican. In the Walker recall, the incumbent won nearly 73% in the vote. In 2008, it was John McCain's second best performing county in the state giving him 62% of the vote. Yet the office I visited was, as far as I could tell, the only one in the county. In neighboring Washington and Ozaukee counties, which make the so-called W-O-W swath of suburban communities around Milwaukee County, there was a mere handful of offices as well.</p> <p>In addition, while there were some volunteers manning the phones and others preparing to knock on doors, most of the foot traffic into the offices were people looking for yard signs or tickets to an upcoming Romney appearance in the state (it would have been Romney's first trip to the state since August, but its since been cancelled).</p> <p>Few of the volunteers had much to say about pushing their people to vote early. This Republican campaign here had the feel of a traditional GOTV operation with traditional campaign techniques. While that might have worked in the recall election, clearly the GOP was up against a much more formidable opponent in President Obama who brings to the table a far more sophisticated set of GOTV techniques.</p> <p>One Republican operative I spoke with said that the 2004 Bush campaign here featured probably as good a ground game as the GOP has ever run in Wisconsin \u2013 and he still lost by 11,000 votes. So while Romney will have a solid ground game behind him it doesn't mean that will be enough to overcome Obama's advantage or the state's Democratic lean in presidential elections.</p> <h2>The recall mirage</h2> <p>Nonetheless, Republicans point to the energy generated around the recall election as a sign that this race will be different \u2013 but it's a tough argument to sustain.</p> <p>Exit polls from the June election indicated that nearly one in five Walker supporters intended to vote for President Obama and that he led in head-to-head match-up against Romney by seven points.</p> <p>While some critics have pointed to inconsistencies in these results, Craig Gilbert, who covers state politics for the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, cautioned against reading too much into the Walker victory in June. </p> <p>\"Wisconsin,\" he said, \"has been on a knife's edge for a long time even though there have been pretty massive swings from surging to Obama in 2008 to then swinging hard for Walker in 2010. I'd be pretty cautious about seeing a shift \u2013 or too much of a shift because of Walker victory. More likely what we're seeing it a return to Wisconsin being the sort of swing state it was in the past with a slight advantage for Obama.\"</p> <p>Indeed, beyond the Walker-Obama supporters, nearly 500,000 Wisconsinites who voted in 2008 sat out the recall. Both sides assume many of those non-voters lean toward Obama, in particular the many liberal-leaning college students who didn't vote in the Walker recall.</p> <p>While it will be crucial for Obama to get these voters to the polls he, like Romney, will also have to do some persuasion as well. At one point, Democrats could often rely on strong turnout from their strongholds around Milwaukee and Madison to win statewide, but Wisconsin as a swing state produces one sizable wrinkle \u2013 it's got a lot of swingy voters.</p> <p>Aside from the Obama-Walker voters, Wisconsin has, according to Nate Cohn, who writes for the New Republic, one of the largest percentages of Bush-Obama voters in the country. This is particularly true around the Green Bay area, which is in north-eastern Wisconsin. In fact, voters who strongly supported George W Bush in 2004 (John Kerry won one country in north-east Wisconsin that year) went overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008. Not coincidentally, it is where the president will be traveling on Tuesday for a last opportunity to persuade the area's still persuadable voters.</p> <p>What will make things a bit easier for Obama is that Wisconsin's economy is not performing as badly as the rest of the country and unemployment is below the national average. Moreover, after Walker and his allies spend the first six months of the year telling voters how great things are in the state it's likely provided an unintentional boon to the Obama effort. And those scripts I mentioned earlier that were in each of the Obama offices \u2013 they brag about the 31 consecutive months of job growth, 5.2m private sector jobs and bemoan the economic calamity that Obama inherited upon taking office.</p> <p>According to one Democrat familiar with focus group research conducted in the wake of the recall election one of the advantages that Walker enjoyed in the recall was that voters were frustrated with Democrats for so stridently opposing Walker's agenda. Many Wisconsin voters feel the same about opposition to Obama and believe that even though they aren't wowed by his performance he deserves a chance to see his agenda through.</p> <p>In the end, that might be the deciding factor for Obama in the state. While there is disappointment with the president, anti-Obama attitudes are not quite as strong as they need to be for Romney to win. The most recent Marist poll in Wisconsin showed 45% of voters think the country is headed in the right direction versus 51% who do not \u2013 a nine-point swing from Marist's previous poll in September. </p> <p>At the same time, Obama approval ratings outweigh his negatives and Obama's polling averages consistently are in the 49-51% range. In fact, Romney hasn't led here since two polls taken in mid-August. A new poll out on Wednesday from Marquette Law School shows Obama leading by eight in the state, a seven-point increase from the school's previous poll. While this latest number is likely a bit high it is reflective of other polling that shows Obama leading in the state.</p> <p>When you combine a historical Democratic lean in presidential election, a steadily improving economy and an Obama ground game that is more than matching the GOP's enthusiasm from the Walker recall it's increasingly hard to imagine that Wisconsin will be turning red next Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">election day</a> looms, I know I'm not the only American woman biting her fingernails. We all care about who the next president will be, but for women the race is particularly anxiety-inducing. The difference between President Barack Obama and governor Mitt Romney on issues of gender can be measured in decades, the latter candidate barely masking his desire to take women back to the 1950s.</p> <p>We already know what an Obama presidency will look like for gender issues. Women appointed at the highest levels of office, from the supreme court to the state department, expanded access to birth control and healthcare and protections against workplace inequities.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we have a pretty good idea of what a Romney presidency will be like for us as well. The former governor of Massachusetts has said he would remove <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" title=\"\">Planned Parenthood</a>'s funding and overturn the supreme court case that legalised abortion. His stance on pay equity \u2013 make sure women can get home in time to cook dinner for their families. This is to say nothing of marriage equality, help for low-income Americans, or gender roles (Romney says one parent should stay at home with children \u2013 not hard to imagine which one he means).</p> <p>It's not hyperbole to say that women's lives hang in the balance. Romney has promised to reinstate the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/23/barack-obama-foreign-abortion-aid\" title=\"\">global gag rule</a>\" \u2013 a ban on federal funds to foreign family planning organisations that either offer abortions or provide information or counselling about abortion. Global health experts have cited it contributing to maternal mortality across the world. If abortion is made illegal \u2013 a very real possibility under a Romney administration \u2013 women will seek out the procedure through unsafe means. And if Obamacare is repealed, that means we're stuck with a president who thinks no American has died for lack of insurance (<a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/\" title=\"\">a Harvard study</a> says 45,000 people a year do).</p> <p>But it's more than women's current rights and lives that are on the line \u2013 the future of feminism is also at stake. Thanks to a never-ending Republican backlash against women's political and cultural gains \u2013 from workplace strides to reproductive health \u2013 American feminists have had their hands full. We're so busy trying to hold on to the rights we already have that any sort of push for forward-thinking policy and change has been out of the question.</p> <p>How can we even think about what a feminist future might look like when we have male legislators who believe women can't get pregnant if they are \"legitimately\" raped, or if they do become pregnant that it was the will of God? We're still dealing with Biology 101 over here. Our lawmakers believe birth control turns women into sluts, that invasive transvaginal ultrasounds are no big deal \u2013 \"Just close your eyes,\" Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett said \u2013 and that women's lives matter so little that <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/169461/republicans-test-your-knowledge-women, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/paul-ryans-abortion-problem/2012/08/30/1e1d34b2-f2d0-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html\" title=\"\">it's alright to tell hospitals to let us die rather than provide abortions</a>.That's not to say that Romney hasn't been working hard to woo women's votes anyway. But the Republican \"pro-woman\" rhetoric has largely comprised damage control and obfuscation. His campaign keeps repeating that women don't care about birth control, abortion rights, and reproductive health \u2013 that women are concerned about the \"real\" issues, like the economy. The fact that women's financial security is intimately connected to the ability to decide if and when to have children seems to be lost on them. They also don't seem to realise that American women don't like men telling us what we do and don't believe in \u2013 we can decide for ourselves.</p> <p>How women are actually likely to vote has been widely projected. An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10500121\" title=\"\">Associated Press poll </a>showed that the gender gap had disappeared, but later numbers \u2013 like an ABC News/Washington Post daily poll \u2013 showed Obama at a comfortable lead among women. The first polls showing the narrowing gender gap was probably a result of Obama's lukewarm performance in the first debate, yet Michael Dimock, the associate director of the Pew Research Centre, told the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/mitt-romney-gender-gap_n_2041803.html\" title=\"\">Huffington Post</a>: \"The entirety of polling over the course of this year suggests \u2026 that the gender gap is likely to look very similar to the last few election cycles, with women [likely] somewhere between six and eight points to favour Obama.\"</p> <p>Obama has not been the perfect feminist president. When he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/12/obama-science-morning-after-pill\" title=\"\">stopped the Food and Drug Administration </a> making Plan B \u2013 also known as the morning-after pil or emergency contraceptionl \u2013 available for young women under 17 without a prescription, I was livid. I don't always agree with his decisions and policies. But when it comes to who will be better for women \u2013 when I think about my two-year-old daughter and the world I want for her \u2013 the choice is clear.</p> <p>I want women to be able to stop worrying about whether or not their hard-won rights will be stripped away. I want to know that my daughter will have the ability to control her body and reproductive future. And I want to know that feminists, who have been tirelessly holding on to our gains, will have some space to think about progressive change rather than just reactionary activism.</p> <p>We should now be able to stop desperately fighting to hold ground and&#xa0;think about what American women&#xa0;need to move forward.</p>",

At some point, you will be taken in by some kind of clown on the internet \u2013 whether it is an internet dating prospect who falls short of his or her description; a con man promising to reunite you with tax refunds or money in Nigeria; or, more likely, someone putting out false information in the hope that you will believe it to be true.</p> <p>As a journalist, I've been fooled in the past by partial information on the internet \u2013 and corrected it fast; every other working journalist has had that experience as well. But there is a blind spot in journalists' ability to determine who is credible, and that blind spot is, apparently, Twitter.</p> <p>Perhaps it's time to update that old cartoon for the age of Twitter: on the internet, it seems, nobody knows you're a troll.</p> <p>Let's talk specifics. This week, there was the curious case of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug\">ComfortablySmug</a> \u2013 aka Shashank Tripathi, a 29 year-old working in finance. Smug, as he was known, gained 6,500 followers over the past few years as an intelligent, self-aware young man inhabiting the persona of an internet troll: that is, someone who says something outrageous to provoke a response.</p> <p>On Twitter, his real identity was hidden, though the essentials of his online persona were not: openly disdainful of \u2013 and yet friendly with \u2013 the press, active in Republican politics, working in finance, and strangely self-aware about his often abrasive online pronouncements. </p> <p>Tripathi, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/comfortablysmug\">who has over 6,500 people following his news alerts and commentary on Twitter</a>, appears to have purposely sent out erroneous \"BREAKING NEWS\" tweets during Hurricane Sandy. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263083953152466947\">claimed that the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was under three feet of water</a> (which nearly 650 people repeated on Twitter initially); that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263083140715773953\">Governor Andrew Cuomo was taken to a secure shelter</a> (when, in fact, he was on television doing interviews); and that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263075838340251648\">ConEdison would pre-emptively shut down power to all of Manhattan</a> (65 retweets). </p> <p>Tripathi was well-known to regular followers as a largely friendly troll, and he was completely in character all night during the brunt of Hurricane Sandy. Among the trolling tweets that Tripathi wrote: fake tweets that he attributed to the official Goldman Sachs Twitter account, such as \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263081585677586432\">in a city underwater, the vampire squid is king</a>,\" and a tweet that he credited to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263080257555402752\">the official Barack Obama Twitter account that advised people to eat their dogs</a>.</p> <p>He confidently declared, \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263064948022849537\">Tomorrow I will begin to rebuild New York City in my image. After the storm, joined by an army of bodega cats, I will seek out the survivors</a>.\"</p> <p>In short, he was obviously a joker. A clear-eyed look at the entirety of his Twitter feed that night would have exposed him as perhaps not the best source of breaking news: a tweeter, writing anonymously, with a well-established taste for mischief. On any sane day, the ridiculous tweets \u2013 usually authored by Tripathi himself \u2013 would easily stand out. </p> <p>But here's what made the difference: Tripathi's claim about the New York Stock Exchange was was shared nearly 650 times, during the height of the storm, largely because journalists and others with powerful credibility carried it across their Twitter accounts. </p> <p>The reach of Tripathi's single tweet on the NYSE was so powerful that the National Weather Service repeated it, which then allowed it to make its way to the Weather Channel and CNN. With an hour, the national press was reporting this completely made-up statement <em>as fact</em>.</p> <p>The blowback from there was complete: BuzzFeed thoroughly outed him with <a href=\"http://gofwd.tumblr.com/post/34640321762/shashank-tripathi-last-nights-twitter-villain\">his full name, profession, picture, and even his entire history as an internet commenter</a>. The reporter, Jack Stuef, also revealed Tripathi to be the campaign manager for a Republican candidate for Congress. New York Councilman Peter F Vallone Jr threatened to throw him in jail. A Twitter search for \"Shashank Tripathi\" reveals the kind of invective usually reserved for criminals and murderers, not stupid pranksters.</p> <p>Tripathi's outing was inevitable: anyone using an anonymous name to bully or troll others <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/10/16/first-cash-financial-services-has-standards-fires-outed-reddit-troll/\">should and will eventually be named</a>. According to his latest tweet, the consequence for Tripathi has been to force his resignation from Wight's congressional campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263466343360253952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I wish to offer the people of New York a sincere, humble and unconditional apology. <a href=\"http://t.co/kIRDqgFR\" title=\"http://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263466343360253952/photo/1\">twitter.com/ComfortablySmu\u2026</a></p>&mdash; ComfortablySmug (@ComfortablySmug) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263466343360253952\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-31T02:24:06+00:00\">October 31, 2012</a></blockquote> <script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </figure>  <p>But the enraged reaction of many to Tripathi's prank was completely out of proportion to his actual offense. His claims were not, as some claimed, the equivalent of \"shouting fire in a crowded movie theater\".</p> <p>For one thing, where was the theater? People in New York were largely trapped at home. Were they really going to run screaming into the streets, unable to handle the idea of the New York Stock Exchange being flooded? Were emergency responders going to stop answering calls to ferry over to the Stock Exchange to prevent water damage to the floors? Would people turn off their generators, hoping to save power for the day when stocks could be traded again? No, no and no.</p> <p>As one fund manager at a $6bn hedge fund concisely put it on Twitter: \"Is it really the end of the world if the floor floods? This is just getting stupid.\"</p> <p>There were those who argued that Tripathi's pranks wasted valuable time that could have been used for storm response. But swatting down rumors is the cost of doing business for many companies; it is, in fact, part of the reason why big companies have Twitter accounts \u2013 to keep an eye on rumor-mongers and reputational damage. That is why they have spokespeople and social media managers, none of whom spend their time pulling bodies out of the wreckage. In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConEdison/status/262671022451470337\">ConEd did respond directly to Tripathi and corrected him</a>; he retweeted their response.</p> <p>As for the NYSE tweet, It took about 45 minutes for Pat Kiernan, a beloved news anchor in New York, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patkiernan/status/263096982854316032\">to point out that a live video feed of the New York Stock Exchange's floor showed it to be <em>completely dry</em></a>. But when Tripathi finally got to correcting his tweets \u2013 \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263102096545574913\">NYSE DID NOT FLOOD</a>\" \u2013 his name had lost sizzle; it only got retweeted five times. </p> <p>Here's the thing: while what Tripathi did was stupid, inappropriate, ill-timed and loathsome, the reaction to it was entirely out of scale to the actual offense. The truth is, Tripathi had a relatively small niche on Twitter. His influence would have been limited had not journalists on Twitter been desperate for information to share, regardless of provenance.</p> <p>He was not the person who affixed those headlines atop legitimate news sources: journalists, who should have checked their sources and did not, used their power of the press to popularize the claim and bring it into people's homes. The decision to <em>publish</em> Tripathi's information was made by journalists, even when his persona and the nature of the information called for skepticism.</p> <p>In fact, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263083953152466947\">first responses to his tweet on the NYSE, from non-journalists</a>, were as follows: \"That's bullshit\"; \"What are the sources for your links?\"; \"confirmed by whom?\" and \"you are a liar.\"</p> <p>Tripathi, as an internet troll, was completely in character, and he had no responsibility to the public. But journalists do have that responsibility \u2013 and so, if Tripathi's silly tweets made it into the national press, it is the national press that is, at heart, to blame for not protecting journalistic standards as well as they should. It is a matter of a few minutes to call a spokesperson or check a live camera, and that is what journalists get paid to do. Producers or editors should not rush information to air or print until those calls have been made, and answered.</p> <p>Any trained journalist could never imagine running to an editor or producer with the claim \"I have information from someone I don't know on the internet!\" and getting a green light to publish.</p> <p>Journalists may get fooled anyway (God knows we do), but the responsibility to readers, listeners and viewers is still in our hands \u2013 not just in the hands of a reporter or editor, but of the entire journalistic teams that report and package and deliver news. When Twitter pronouncements make it to TV, the web or papers, it is journalists who are the gatekeepers who allow that. Even in the internet age, when information is easier to obtain, individual judgment counts: judgment on who to trust, the character of sources, knowing their agendas and history.</p> <p>Anyone who read Tripathi's tweets, armed with that context, was not likely to have been fooled. </p> <p>Most odd, however, is the underlying assumption, by those over-reacting to Tripathi's offense, that he violated some kind of internet code of honor. That makes zero sense. The internet has always been a place of the roiling, squirming guts of the information economy; it has never been a pure and inviolable place of absolute truth and reliability. People will lie; they will make mistakes; they will provoke and misrepresent and they will publish before they have complete information.</p> <p>The job of professional journalists is to sift through that. And when we get mad at others for fooling us, we should also be mad at ourselves for fooling our readers.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally stated that Tripathi was a hedge-fund analyst (information via Buzzfeed); his specific job title and role is disputed, and not confirmed. The article was amended accordingly at 5pm ET on 31 October 2012</em></p>",
  "<p>The BBC is seeking to regain control of the Jimmy Savile scandal with the announcement of an initiative on supporting victims of child abuse in partnership with charities, after weeks of revelations that have devastated its reputation.</p> <p>The broadcaster has held discussions with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the National Association of People Abused in Childhood (Napac) about a scheme that it hopes will \"put it on the front foot\" and demonstrate it is taking serious action over the mounting allegations of child abuse carried out on BBC premises.</p> <p>Sources say that \"what is needed, for whom and what is the best way of doing it\" has yet to be determined, but it is believed that an agreement with a charity partner will be announced in coming days.</p> <p>It is not clear if the BBC will contribute any funds towards an initiative, although the corporation is mindful of the sensitivities of committing licence fee payers' money to non-broadcasting activity. But the BBC may well be able to donate airtime or employee time, or commit other non-cash resources.</p> <p>Pete Saunders, chief executive of Napac, said he met George Entwistle, the BBC's director general, on Tuesday. \"He was very supportive: they really want to help survivors. What I got was a very positive meeting \u2013 I told him we need to expand, we need resources.\"</p> <p>Saunders added that the charity was \"fighting a tidal wave\" of almost 6,000 calls and emails from abuse victims since the scandal broke. Napac has only been able to deal with 700, Saunders said.</p> <p>The emergence of the initiative comes days after Scotland Yard and the NSPCC, which are working together on the Operation Yewtree investigation into Savile's alleged abuse, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/28/jimmy-savile-police-investigation-grew\" title=\"\">revealed they are now dealing with</a> 300 people whose cases stretch back over 40 years and involve not just the BBC, but Stoke Mandeville hospital, Leeds General Infirmary and the Duncroft Approved school for girls.</p> <p>The claims against Savile have plunged the BBC into what veteran world affairs correspondent John Simpson has described as its worst crisis in 50 years, with the chairman of the BBC Trust admitting it could lead to resignations.</p> <p>The BBC has battled to get the upper hand in the crisis but criticism continues to rain down from every direction. David Cameron has said the nation is \"appalled\" with the revelations that Savile appears to have lured vulnerable children into dressing rooms at the BBC and abused them, and said serious questions need to be asked after the corporation changed its story on why an investigation by Newsnight in November last year was shelved while tribute programmes went ahead.</p> <p>The BBC is also facing lawsuits, with lawyers preparing at least 18 claims for damages.</p> <p>Entwistle was accused of displaying an \"extraordinary lack of curiosity\" by a parliamentary committee last week for not inquiring about the Newsnight investigation about Savile when he was told about it, while the deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman told parliament the scandal was \"a stain\" on the BBC's reputation.</p> <p>The head of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, tried to regain the initiative last week by going on a tour of TV studios saying it was difficult to swim against the \"tsunami of filth\" that was threatening to smother the corporation.</p>",
  "<p>Until violence erupted in northern Mali, the Hotel Via Via had been on the verge of expansion, scooping up tourists and business travellers who not long ago congregated in Mopti \u2013 a bustling gateway between the north and south, surrounded by the water of the Niger and Bani rivers. Since al-Qaida-linked groups seized control of large swaths of the north of the country, leaving Mopti on the frontline between the government-controlled south and the Islamist-controlled north, outside visitors have vanished, and so have the expansion plans. Instead, the hotel's half-built wings provide a discreet location for the Ganda Koya, a militia whose name means \"son of the nation\" in the local Sonrai language.</p> <p>As dusk settled over the hotel, a group of the militia scuttled between the building and a makeshift camp across the road where many rent cheap accommodation. One of them, Fatou Sissiko \u2013 a pretty, 18-year-old girl wearing a low-cut sleeveless vest and African print skirt \u2013 held a friend's baby girl on her arm as she talked quietly and reluctantly about the atrocities she witnessed in her home town, Gao, after it was taken over by the Islamist group the Movement for Tawhid and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao) in March.</p> <p>\"I left Gao because I want to fight to liberate the city,\" she said. \"I hated living under the Mujao. They are dangerous people, they don't fear death. They killed many innocent people, I saw it with my own eyes. They destroyed my school. Our parents send us money so that we can stay in Mopti and learn to fight \u2013 they support what we are doing.\"</p> <p>Sissiko is one of thousands of young people who have grown frustrated at the failure of the Mali government \u2013 which was toppled by a coup on 22 March and has been replaced by a widely despised interim regime \u2013 to protect its citizens in the north.</p> <p>Despite a United Nations security council resolution earlier this month opening the door to military intervention to end al-Qaida's hold over the northern region, residents have continued to flee.</p> <p>An estimated 35,000 internally displaced people, of whom 10,000 are living in official camps, have arrived in the Mopti region alone since the government lost control of northern Mali, one security source told the Guardian.</p> <p>Many, like Sissiko, have joined militias, prompting fears that the ranks of independent trained and armed northerners could create further problems for the country.</p> <p>Military action \u2013 which an official source insists is being pursued alongside the possibility of negotiations \u2013 is likely to begin in the new year. But civilian authorities in Mopti are already gearing up for war in the north, and are preparing emergency plans to merge the police, gendarmerie, national guard and emergency services.</p> <p>\"Militia members are in their thousands, and their numbers are multiplying,\" said the source. \"I fear the impact of their existence on the country \u2013 they are regional and ethnocentric organisations that can only further divide Mali.</p> <p>\"If people want to liberate the north they should integrate into the national forces, otherwise it risks creating a whole new problem when this war is over.\"</p> <p>Despite reports that the ranks of the Islamist groups \u2013 Mujao in Gao, Ansar Dine in Kidal, and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in Timbuktu \u2013 are filled by insurgents from neighbouring Algeria and Mauritania, people from those towns say that their numbers have been bolstered by Malians who have joined the groups as a means of survival.</p> <p>In a refugee camp next door to the Via Via, a slender man wearing overalls sits slumped against the wall on a low bench. The makeshift camp is another abandoned hotel, this one built as cheap overnight accommodation for the drivers who once accompanied their affluent employers on visits to Mopti. The long, single-storey buildings are crowded with scores of half-dressed children, women pounding food for the evening meal, and tents bearing the Swiss Red Cross logo.</p> <p>Oumar Ciss\u00e9, 42, was a motorbike mechanic in Douanza \u2013 a town in the Mopti region currently controlled by the Mujao \u2013 when Islamists, including people he grew up with, began terrorising the local people.</p> <p>\"Ordinary people I have known all my life, who I used to sit down and drink tea with, joined the Islamists and killed their own neighbours,\" said Ciss\u00e9. \"I cannot join them \u2013 I just want to live a normal life and educate my children. I fled here with my two wives and 11 children.\"</p> <p>Ciss\u00e9, a Bella \u2013 the ethnic name used for black Tuaregs \u2013 said conditions in the camp were almost unbearable. He is one of the minority of internally displaced people living in official government accommodation, which he said was heavily overcrowded.</p> <p>\"Now my sisters, who are teachers, have also joined us [in Mopti] because the Mujao have closed all the schools in Douanza \u2013 they don't believe in western education. During the rainy season we were 15 people sleeping in one room. We had to take it in turns to stand up at night.\"</p> <p>The refugees said they welcomed plans for a military intervention to reclaim the north, currently being drawn up in the capital city, Bamako, by the Mali government, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, with other international support from the European Union and the US.</p> <p>\"I am a simple man, I don't know about the details of who should do what; all I know is that I want to go home and return to my normal life, and if we do not have outside help this is not going to happen,\" said Ciss\u00e9.</p> <p>A security source, who asked not to be named, said that there were concerns that Mopti \u2013 only 30 miles (50km) from the region where al-Qaida-linked groups have held power since March \u2013 would be destabilised by the absence of the armed forces, which have a major base in the city. There are also fears that Islamist sleeper cells in Mopti and other southern cities have the capability to launch terrorist attacks.</p>",
  "<p>In Glasgow two months ago a 14-year-old boy <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19207797\" title=\"\">was jailed for seven years for fatally stabbing his 34-year-old foster mother</a>. The incident took place a year ago. In the days leading up to the murder, the boy had been grounded, and his Xbox, mobile phone and laptop \u2013 which he used to keep in contact with his natural mother \u2013 were taken from him as punishment for his behaviour. According to his foster father, Bryan McKenzie, who had left the family home an hour before the attack, the boy didn't seem overly upset by the punishment. Dawn and Bryan McKenzie were first-time foster parents and were, perhaps, through no fault of their own, out of their depth with the boy. As seasoned fosterers/adopters are aware, there is a fine line when it comes to disciplining children who are already disturbed by their backgrounds, and taking so much from him was obviously inadvisable.</p> <p>It's a story that constantly repeats itself \u2013 placing children with foster and adoptive families who cannot cope with their difficulties \u2013 though not often with fatal consequences. Either the social workers underplay the degree of a child's difficulties, or they don't understand the significance, and all too often, a ticking time-bomb is placed within innocent, well-meaning families.</p> <p>In 2003, the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/27/law.children\" title=\"\">published an account of my family's experiences of the adoption system</a>. We had fostered Louise when she was two and a half, and adopted her five years later, still optimistic \u2013 despite the hell we had lived through already \u2013 that all would end up happily. In the early years, she smeared herself with excreta, picked wounds in herself until she bled, attacked anything that moved, and screamed day and night. We told social services that we would not knowingly take a child with learning disabilities because we didn't think we could cope, but we were told Louise was suffering from emotional deprivation, and all she needed was tender, loving care. Back then we were naive and didn't understand the rules. For instance, if we wouldn't \"knowingly\" take a child with learning disabilities, they just wouldn't tell us. What they also failed to pass on was that she had brain damage from having been battered and had a family history of mental illness.</p> <p>Completely in the dark and too exhausted to do more than survive, we struggled on, trying to solve problems we didn't know existed, while caring for our other two children, one a year older than Louise, the other a year younger. The people at social services laughed when we wondered if Louise might have learning disabilities and by the time this became too apparent to deny, Louise was our child. That is what social services count on: if the child can be kept with you long enough, you will not want to give her/him up. It doesn't matter that other children in the family are being short-changed; their childhoods ruined while you try to cope with the one who needs the most attention and ends up with all of it. By the time Louise was 16, she was diagnosed with learning difficulties. She was suffering from brain damage, mental health problems and autism.</p> <p>I wrote the 2003 article in response to a surge of adverts featuring celebrities encouraging people to adopt smiling, but needy, children. Tony Blair was in office, feverishly burnishing his public image by volunteering as patron saint and saviour of little children. Blair's father had been adopted, went the spiel, and it hadn't done him any harm, so we should get everyone adopted. Jane Asher also extolled the joys of adoption to the populace, despite not having any experience of adoption herself.</p> <p>What has changed since 2003? Well, David Cameron has assumed the mantle of patron saint and saviour of little children, abetted by Michael Gove, who was himself adopted as a baby. What they are ignoring is that adoption has changed from what they think it ever was. For a start, there were never any well brought-up little orphans looking for loving parents. What we had were unmarried mothers who couldn't afford to raise children alone \u2013 though many did \u2013 and couldn't take the embarrassment and stigma of bearing an illegitimate child. But times have changed. Unmarried mothers are now single parents who have financial support from the state and there is no stigma these days \u2013 the \"illegitimate\" label that once marked children from cradle to grave has gone, and rightly so. What this means is that mothers are far more likely to keep their babies and there are virtually none available for adoption, so couples are encouraged to look at older children instead. And thereby a can of worms opens up.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.baaf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association for Adoption and Fostering</a>, only 2% of the children adopted in the year to March 2011 in England were under one (71% were aged one to four, 24% five to nine). The children available for adoption these days have often been removed from parents who have mental health, drug and alcohol problems. They have most likely been left with those parents until the bitter end because the state believes that children do better with their own parents. By the time these children are removed, they are already damaged by years of neglect and abuse. They are no longer children in need of an ordinary family;&#xa0;in fact often that is the last thing they can cope with, and they are the last thing an ordinary family can cope with. In recent years, a few caveats have appeared in appeals. \"Needs extra attention,\" is one. To prospective adopters, that seems reasonable. Until they've been put through the mill, they don't realise it&#xa0;actually means the life you had may be destroyed.</p> <p>Local authorities don't own up to the breakdown rate in adoption either. Ask and the reply is very likely to be a vague \"not much\". Some local authorities and adoption agencies have been forced to admit to a rate of 20%, but that isn't the whole picture. Some years ago the Strathclyde region, then the biggest social work area in Europe, investigated the situation. That 1986 report found breakdown rates rising from 16% for children placed at age five, to 60% at nine and over \u2013 that's six out of 10 children adopted going back into care. And that report counted three years as a successful adoption, which doesn't take into account the fact breakdowns also happen later than that. The author of the report, Sandy Jamieson, former assistant director of social work in charge of childcare, reviewed the figures twice in the early 90s and found the situation had not improved, and indeed had possibly got worse. There is absolutely no reason to suspect that other areas of the UK have achieved better results.</p> <p>But one thing that has changed since 2005 is that adopters are increasingly prepared to fight back. Social services are destroying marriages and lives, trying to get problem children off their books. It feels as though they will use any means, and that legal action against the local authorities concerned is the only thing that might stop them.</p> <p>Chris and Jane are both officers in the Metropolitan police, and have four children, who were aged 25, 22, 12 and nine when the couple decided to adopt. Jane had worked in child protection for six years, and they had both been involved with the Scouts, the PTA and every other child-orientated organisation you can think of. They made the decision to adopt because they \"wanted to make a difference\". Five-and-a-half-year-old Suzie was presented to them by social services as \"bright, bubbly, no shrinking violet, a perfect match for your family\". Suzie's arrival, more than five years ago, was \"an explosion\". Jane describes a child who was scared of everything: \"She would cower under her bed and was terrified of ordinary things. The TV scared her.\" Suzie's behaviour began to escalate into constant violence and aggression: \"Every waking moment was chaos. It was like living in a war zone. Her school couldn't cope with her either.</p> <p>\"She seemed desperate to be loved, but couldn't take love, couldn't manage relationships at all. Other children didn't want to know her because of her behaviour, so she had no friends. She would scream at us constantly: 'I hate you! I hate this family! Send me back!' In fact her first words to us were: 'Are you going to be my forever mummy and daddy? Do you like hurting people?' We had expected emotional problems, but not the total destruction of our family.\"</p> <p>At the same time, Jane and Chris were trying to cope with other problems. Their eldest son had a brain tumour and needed surgery, but Suzie was causing hell. \"There was no help,\" Jane recalls. \"We asked social services, but they did nothing. We were left to cope alone. Gradually we became isolated because other people don't want to put up with her.\"</p> <p>Jane had a breakdown and still there was no support. Then came an incident in 2010 that still haunts her. \"Suzie attacked me,\" she says. \"She was screaming: 'Go on, punch me, you know you want to!' I wanted to annihilate her, I wanted to kill her and I didn't care if I was arrested. I raised my arm to hit her, but something stopped me. Even so, I couldn't go near her for two days. I called social services but once again they did nothing. I didn't adopt her to hate her or to harm her, but that's how it was.\"</p> <p>On Mother's Day 2011, Jane had a second breakdown. \"I just snapped. I&#xa0;got up, packed my bags and left,\" she remembers. \"By now I was terrified of Suzie and just wanted to disappear for ever. I drove through the Highlands of Scotland for eight days, then boarded a ferry for the Isle of Lewis. I saw a police car and they flashed me. Chris had reported me missing. I didn't stop and there was a pursuit. It went on for over an hour \u2013 I even evaded roadblocks \u2013 and ended with them boxing me in, smashing the windows, dragging me out and handcuffing me. I was strip-searched and thrown into a cell for 21 hours. I wasn't even allowed to wash. When Chris arrived, he was allowed five minutes with me. I&#xa0;pleaded not guilty and the psychiatric reports confirmed I was ill from stress. In the end, I was given a complete discharge. Afterwards I&#xa0;was put on medication, but I still have panic attacks.\"</p> <p>At the age of 11, Suzie is now registered as disabled because of her mental health problems and is also on medication, but her special school is still struggling with her, and with puberty fast approaching, her situation is certain to become more difficult. Chris and Jane felt so strongly about how they had been misled that they approached a solicitor to try to sue the local authority, but were advised by counsel that they wouldn't win because of a 2004 judgment of a similar case. In that instance the adoptive parents had won, only for the local authority to appeal. The judge allowed compensation, but only from placement to the time the couple found out what they had not been told about a boy's violent behaviour. Thereafter they kept the child instead of handing him back, and the judge decided they would not be compensated from the adoption date \u2013 they were effectively penalised for not abandoning the boy. The judgment stated: \"If there is to be a duty of care, the professionals should be addressing their minds to their first consideration, the welfare of the child throughout his childhood, rather than anything else \u2026 we would not hold that it is fair, just or reasonable to impose on professionals involved in compiling reports for adoption agencies a duty of care towards prospective adopters.\"</p> <p>Jane is angered by this, and by the judge's suggestion that \"adopters have a trial period to decide whether to keep the child\", as though children are defective used cars that you just return after a test drive. \"In our case,\" says Jane, \"when the papers were disclosed, you wouldn't believe the number they had 'lost'. We learned that the mother was a serious offender with mental health problems and there had been severe neglect for years. Suzie had been going into and out of care all her life and her difficulties had been known about. They just didn't tell us.\"</p> <p>For Jane, the system is \"appalling, soul-destroying and makes no sense. Where was their duty of care to Suzie when they placed her with a family without knowing if they could cope? She was severely let down by them. We were so low at one point, we talked about divorce. Where would it have left Suzie and our boys if that had happened?\" The couple are investigating other legal avenues. They feel strongly that the legislation must be changed to ensure full disclosure of a child's difficulties, plus support after placement. \"The only reason I go on is because I have to believe it will all be worth it. We have all suffered so much, I have to believe it wasn't for nothing.\"</p> <p>Modern adoption is always difficult. Sometimes it brings happiness, and sometimes it ruins lives. Until something is done to sort a system that is clearly flawed and not fit for purpose, there needs to be an end to the call for faster universal adoption.</p>",
  "<p>Labour is facing the embarrassment of having to withdraw from the Northamptonshire police and crime commissioner election in two weeks time after its candidate was forced to quit on Monday.</p> <p>The party has launched an inquiry into the suspension of Lee Barron, a regional secretary of the Communications Workers Union, as its official candidate after it emerged he had been arrested and fined \u00a320 for willfully obstructing the police during a pub incident 22 years ago.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is hoping for a high-profile Commons byelection victory in the Northamptonshire constituency of Corby but now faces the prospect of not contesting the county's police commissioner job. Nominations closed on 19 October.</p> <p>Barron is the third Labour candidate to be forced to quit the police commissioner contests because of a minor conviction in their youth. He has been a magistrate for the past 10 years and in a statement said: \"I was a young lad at the time. I don't think society takes a view that if you do something wrong you should be punished for the rest of your life. That night was a sea change for me. From that moment on I pledged I'd never get into trouble again and that's why I have been a magistrate for 10 years.\"</p> <p>Barron said he was arrested when trouble flared as he was watching an England football match in a Northampton pub in 1990. A friend was arrested and Barron, aged 19, at the time tried to intercede. He was himself arrested and fined \u00a320 for obstruction.</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said: \"We are disappointed to learn from Lee today that he has a previous conviction which bars him from standing as a candidate. He has been suspended with immediate effect and we have withdrawn our support pending an investigation.\"</p> <p>Several candidates have been caught out by changes to the rules governing the kind of convictions that debar police commissioner candidates. The original legislation specified that only those which carried a custodial sentence would count but this was widened to all convictions, a move which had the support of Labour.</p>",
  "<p>The home secretary, Theresa May, has been told by peers and MPs that her \u00a31.8bn internet monitoring proposals will be a \"honeypot for hackers and criminals around the world\" and that she must bring in prison sentences for those who hack databases.</p> <p>May has spelled out for the first time the expected timetable for the introduction of the communications data bill, indicating that she intends it to reach the statute book before the next general election and be \"in play\" within a few years.</p> <p>The controversial web monitoring proposals in the bill, which opponents call a \"snooper's charter\", will require internet and phone companies to track the records of every citizen's web and mobile phone use, including social networking sites, without retaining their content, and store them for 12 months.</p> <p>May told parliament's joint committee scrutinising the draft version of the bill that she expects the actual legislation to be introduced later this parliamentary session, which is to run until next summer, and then be carried over to the next session, reaching the statute book by 2014.</p> <p>The committee heard from senior police officers this week that the web monitoring plan was a vital operational tool in infiltrating criminal gangs and tackling security threats in a world where rapidly changing technology meant the authorities were losing the ability to keep track of criminal suspects.</p> <p>Sir Peter Fahy, the Greater Manchester chief constable, said being able to monitor the basic details of who was talking to whom was \"absolutely vital\" in \"proving associations between criminals\". The Home Office has argued that, as technology changes and new platforms emerge, the authorities' ability to keep track of suspects has degraded by as much as 25%.</p> <p>But peers and MPs on the joint committee raised fears that the massive increase in the storage of sensitive personal data required could lead to invasion of privacy on a new scale, and be open to criminal attack.</p> <p>A Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Strasburger, described the proposals as a \"honeypot for casual hackers, blackmailers, criminals large and small from around the world, and foreign states\".</p> <p>A former Labour minister, Nicholas Brown, said the public were frightened they \"were going to be spied on\" and that \"illegally obtained\" information would find its way to the public domain.</p> <p>He supported a call from the Information Commissioner for the enactment of powers already on the statute book to impose prison sentences of up to 12 months, and not just heavy fines, for those who unlawfully obtain personal data.</p> <p>The home secretary agreed to look at the detail of the custodial powers specified in sections 77 and 78 of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/contents\" title=\"\">2008 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act</a>, which carry a public-interest and investigative-journalism defence for those who \"blag\" access to confidential personal information. The issue is one that Lord Justice Leveson is also expected to pronounce upon.</p> <p>May also agreed to reconsider the terms of clause 1 of the bill, which would give her very widely drawn powers to make orders requiring internet and phone companies to hand over an individual's communications records to \"relevant public authorities\".</p> <p>May said that this would mainly be used for tackling terrorism, serious crime and paedophilia, but added that the government needed flexibility in the legislation to meet rapid changes in technology and ensure the bill was not outdated by the time it passed. However, the committee made clear that it was this desire to \"future-proof\" the legislation that was causing the most public alarm.</p> <p>The home secretary sidestepped questions about how she felt about Britain becoming the first democracy to use the kind of \"deep packet inspection\" web monitoring system so far only used in China, Iran and Kazakhstan.</p> <p>But May insisted it was a myth that the state was going to read everyone's emails: \"There is a limited scope for the data we want to have access to. We have been very clear about that at every stage. The police would have to make a clear case for requesting access to data when there was an investigation that required it.</p> <p>\"The aim of this is to ensure our law enforcement agencies can carry on having access to the data they find so necessary operationally in terms of investigation, catching criminals and saving lives.\"</p> <p>Police made urgent requests for communications data in 30,000 cases last year and between 25% and 40% of them had resulted in lives being saved, May said. \"I think that matters to the public,\" she told the committee.</p>",
  "<p>At the start of the 1925-26 season, Arsenal lost at home to Tottenham Hotspur, then soon after travelled to Newcastle United, where they were pummelled 7-0. Their new manager Herbert Chapman's response to these setbacks was to think \"bugger this\". Shouting \"bugger this\", he sat down with his star signing Charlie Buchan to concoct a ground-breaking tactical scheme designed to stop the side shipping goals.</p> <p>Chapman and Buchan's genius back-of-an-envelope solution \u2014 an extra defender \u2014 took a while to implement successfully. The offside law had just been changed, and the befuddled pros of the time were primarily preoccupied with frowning, slowly raising their index fingers to their bottom lips, and scratching their pomade-polished pates in dizzy confusion. But both new rule and new formation eventually sunk in, and the sort of crazy scorelines so prevalent in the early days of football \u2013 8-2, 3-5, 5-2, 5-7 \u2014 slowly became rarer and rarer, until one day they were almost completely a thing of the past.</p> <p>Having erected one of the major staging posts along football's long and arduous journey from Carefree Fun Pastime to Needlessly Complicated Tactical Grind Which Fans, Paying Good Money To Be Entertained After A Hard Week's Work, Are Forced To Dissect And Analyse Like Naughty Schoolchildren Set Extra Mathematical Problems For Homework, it could be argued that Arsenal owe everyone a mindless goalfest or two.</p> <p>Well, if the club's recent tumultuous AGM taught us anything, it's that the Gunners like to keep a careful eye on the balance sheet. All of which may explain why, rather honourably, the team appear to have spent the last year or two settling a few karmic debts.</p> <p>One-nil to the Arsenal, they used to sing. Since the start of last season, Arsenal have reached the six-goal mark on four occasions, twice going on to score seven. They've been skelped 8-2 at Manchester United; won 5-3 at Chelsea; hammered their arch rivals Spurs 5-2; and failed by a whisker to overturn a 4-0 deficit against Milan in the Champions League. Then on Tuesday night they came from four goals down to win 7-5 at Reading, a monumental recovery which handsomely paid back their travelling support for <em>that</em> 4-4 capitulation at Newcastle not so long ago.</p> <p>There are memorable matches, and then memorable matches. And Arsenal have been involved in some seriously memorable matches. Their fans may wish a couple of them were not so \u2013 the unprecedented eight-goal collapse at Old Trafford last August, the surreal second-half shame of St James' back in January 2011 \u2013 but some of these recent comebacks are results for the ages. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's brief reign at Chelsea might not look so clever these days, but his side were playing some freewheeling football until Robin van Persie spectacularly dismounted them.</p> <p>Later in the season, Spurs were positively humiliated at the Emirates, checked by Theo Walcott as they threatened to break into a hubristic strut towards Europe's top table at Arsenal's expense. Even the one that didn't quite come off \u2013 the near-miss against Milan in the Champions League, three goals in 45 whirlwind second-leg minutes \u2013 arguably stands as their most outrageous performance in Europe's premier competition. Just a shame they ran out of puff during the second half.</p> <p>In qualitative terms, those were all better performances than the jaw-dropping 7-5 victory at Reading, a game which could only have got more farcical had Adam Federici accidentally locked himself in a wardrobe without any trousers on. But you can't get too picky with a 12-goal thriller, and given how the League Cup has acted as a harbinger of good times for Arsenal in the past \u2013 those 1987 Littlewoods Cup wins over Spurs and Liverpool which laid the foundations for the George Graham era, of course, but also the two near-misses in the late 1960s, finals lost to Leeds and Swindon, experiences which readied Bertie Mee's team for double success in 1971 \u2013 this could end up being one of the most pivotal results in Arsenal's history.</p> <p>Arsenal's cupboard has been bare since 2005. On the one hand, that's a sorry state of affairs for one of English and European football's giants, and most fans would understandably be perfectly content to sit through three turgid 1-0s, the sort the club was once so famous for, in order to raise the Capital One Cup, and lift what's beginning to feel like a curse. But it's also ironic that since the heat's recently been turned up on Wenger \u2013 patience an increasingly rare commodity after failure to land the 2011 Carling Cup made it six barren seasons on the bounce \u2013 his side have been at their most entertaining for years.</p> <p>Football, that chap down the other end of the Seven Sisters Road would be distressed to discover, really is first and last about winning these days. But while Arsenal's roll of honour hasn't lengthened for quite a while, they've recently presented their fans with more than a few moments of glory. That might not be enough for some, but then nobody's been dying of boredom. For that, Wenger should be afforded plenty of slack. And whatever happens, they'll always have Reading.</p>",
  "<p>High autumn is the season of scary stories. Rusting leaves and greyish-white tendrils of mist impel me to take down half-remembered, wholly feared volumes from the safety of the highest shelves. Evil magic, unquiet spirits, banal objects with unsuspected teeth: all come out in good time for Halloween, and remain in the ascendant until Christmas Eve. Especially children's books. Frightening stories read as a child affect the reader at bone-marrow level, helping to shape the fears and vague uneasinesses you'll carry all your life, long after you've forgotten their sources. Encountering the originals again, in sober adulthood and a well-lit room, may draw the monster's teeth \u2013 or confirm that your childhood self was right to be so frightened.</p> <p>One of my favourite ghost story collections is <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Foot_in_the_Grave.html?id=5DJsqED8zIcC&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">A Foot in the Grave</a>, featuring eight stories written by Joan Aiken to fit a series of Jan Pienkowski's stark, neon-backed silhouettes, rather than the more conventional way round. This collaboration produced a book that still gives me the chills every time I read or remember it \u2013 the horrible aunt who returns as a creeping, strangling vine in Bindweed, and the history teacher whose grave-robbing on a trip abroad is punished by an encounter with local horror \"la larva\" are both memorably nasty. The gem of the collection, though, is Amberland \u2013 an eerily beautiful imagined haven, which the narrator's bullied little brother goes to fatal lengths to reach. Like all the best ghost stories, it's layered with as much sorrow and regret as straightforward fear.</p> <p>Another well-thumbed favourite frightener is <a href=\"http://www.theresabreslin.co.uk/whispers.php\" title=\"\">Theresa Breslin's Whispers in the Graveyard</a>, which deservedly won the 1994 Carnegie for its slow-building menace. It centres on a forgotten smallpox graveyard and a chest inscribed with the hissable word \"Malefice\". The dyslexic young protagonist, Solomon, is driven by a teacher's cruelty to seek solitary refuge in the kirkyard, but a forgotten evil awaits him there, battening on his furious emotions. Similarly, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_scarecrows.html?id=T3b8l4BFkV4C&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Robert Westall's The Scarecrows</a> is right up there with MR James \u2013 three amorphous straw figures, animated by the cold anger of a disturbed teenager, move inexorably to repeat their murderous past, drawing him along with them.

Constructed around <a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~zierke/martin.carthy/songs/longlankin.html\" title=\"\">a haunting ballad</a> (bedwettingly scary in itself: \"Said my lord to my lady as he mounted his horse, / \"Beware of Long Lankin that lives in the moss\"), Barraclough's book breaks all the writing-for-kids rules by foregrounding an adult as one of several narrative voices. But Aunt Ida's angry, terrified presence, more responsible and more awfully knowledgeable than the child protagonists, only emphasises the realness of the thin, ubiquitous predator in the book's background, waiting to creep in at any \"unpinned window\" and carry away another tiny child.</p> <p>More lightheartedly \u2013 but still full of pumpkin-headed, black-mouthed ghosts, and the red-eyed, unseen horror Bo Cleevil \u2013 Jodi Lynn Anderson's <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/563310.May_Bird_and_the_Ever_After\" title=\"\">May Bird and the Ever After</a> is an assured and satisfying read, a hybrid of Stephen King's <a href=\"http://clothesonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Beetle-Juice_Michael-Keaton_striped-suit_mid.bmp-1.jpg\" title=\"\">Bag of Bones and Beetlejuice</a> for younger readers.

  "<p>Greek trade unions vowed on Wednesday to bring the country to a halt next week after agreeing a two-day general strike in protest at the latest round of welfare and wages cuts.</p> <p>The strike call came after the government outlined a series of austerity measures in its revised 2013 budget that predicts a sixth year of contraction and an escalation in its debt-to-GDP ratio to 167%. The prime minister, Antonis Samaras, said negotiations with the major lenders were concluded and it was time for MPs to vote through measures to secure \u20ac31bn (\u00a324bn) of fresh loans.</p> <p>The \u20ac13.5bn of cuts for 2013-14 include a two-year increase in the retirement age from the current average of 65, salary and pension cuts, and another round of tax increases, including the levy on interest from bank deposits, up from 10% to 15%. The vast majority of measures are to be implemented in 2013 and include a \u20ac4.6bn cut in pensions and a \u20ac1.2bn reduction in salaries.</p> <p>Unions responded by announcing a 48-hour general strike that could persuade some coalition MPs to join opposition groups in rejecting a bill to be tabled by finance minister Yannis Stournaras next week.</p> <p>However, there was confusion on Wednesday after some European finance ministers warned they still needed to address some outstanding budget issues before releasing funds to the Greek government.</p> <p>German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble was pessimistic about the chances of a quick decision on payment of the bailout instalment. \"To secure the tranche being paid out, we need preconditions to be met that still have not been achieved,\" he said.</p> <p>The strain in the governing coalition was evident earlier, in a parliamentary vote on a bill to allow the government to privatise public utilities. The legislation was passed, but 15 MPs from the Pasok party, which is a junior partner in the coalition, voted against certain articles. Dissenters included former prime minister George Papandreou, who opposed one article in the legislation.</p> <p>Stournaras submitted the revised budget to parliament on Wednesday but the deputy finance minister cancelled a presentation of the budget due to a 24-hour journalists' strike in protest at their industry healthcare plan being drawn into spending cuts of \u20ac455m.</p> <p>The coalition is under pressure to pass the budget before the 11 November deadline set by Greece's international creditors. Officials are also concerned that Greece find a way to refinance more than \u20ac3bn of loans due for renewal on 16&#xa0;November.</p> <p>Ben May, an analyst at Capital Economics, said he was concerned that Greece's debts were already unsustainable and further austerity measures would aggravate the situation. He pointed to the International Monetary Fund's warning in its recent world economic outlook that the country's debts were likely to reach 183% of GDP next year. May said the expectation that a recovery from 2014 would bring the figure back to 120% by 2020 was nothing more than an illusion.</p> <p>\"There is still a significant risk that Greece will not survive another year inside the eurozone,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>Towards the end of the first half of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/14/three-sisters-review\" title=\"\">Young Vic's current production of Three Sisters</a>, there is a spirited rendition of <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/nirvana/smells-like-teen-spirit-music-video/195800/\" title=\"\">Smells Like Teen Spirit</a> \u2013 in place of what should be a folk song. I happened to be sitting next to two young Russians, and one told me he thought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain\" title=\"\">Kurt Cobain</a>'s existential angst was a bit too obvious for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/chekhov\" title=\"\">Chekhov</a>. \"Some of the subtleties have been lost in this production,\" he said. Perhaps. I did spend the interval humming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana\" title=\"\">Nirvana</a> rather than thinking about the plight of the Prozorov sisters.</p> <p>What constitutes a truthful performance of Chekhov? The question arises because this in-your-face (to use my Russian's term) production \u2013 which is playing to full houses in London \u2013 precedes a contrasting pair of Uncle Vanyas in the West End. One is directed by the much-garlanded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/28/theatre\" title=\"\">Lindsay Posner</a> and has a starry cast, including <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Player/Player_Page/0,,45431,00.html\" title=\"\">Ken Stott</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/oct/21/anna-friel-interview-uncle-vanya\" title=\"\">Anna Friel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/10/sam-west-family-values\" title=\"\">Sam West</a>; the other, by the Moscow-based company Vakhtangov, promises to make the Young Vic production look, if anything, rather tame.</p> <p>Vakhtangov, in their press release, poke fun at how Chekhov is often staged here: it's like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a> reworked by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/22/pass-notes-dostoevsky-russia-metro\" title=\"\">Dostoevsky</a>, they imply, vowing to brush away the cobwebs with their version: \"There's no Chekhovian mansion, no cosy armchairs, no table laid for lunch, with a lacy tablecloth and hot samovar [tea urn]; no feeling of 'home' where several generations have lived.\" Instead, we are promised a \"battlefield of passions, broken illusions and unrealised hopes\".</p> <p>It is certainly one way of looking at this story of a middle-aged drudge, Vanya, whose life in the countryside is turned upside down by the arrival from the city of his bombastic brother-in-law and his much younger wife. The director, Rimas Tuminas, tells me via email: \"I have eliminated all those valenki [felt boots] and galoshes, the samovar and the old clock. It is all useless. Through an actor, I can send the audience wherever I want. While everyone is there to drink their tea, life is breaking to pieces \u2013 and that is what must be staged. I am not fond of decor changes.\"</p> <p>For all its Nirvana and radicalism, there is plenty of tea in the Young Vic's Three Sisters. This may underline <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/10/benedict-andrews-chekhov-three-sisters\" title=\"\">director Benedict Andrews</a>' point that despite its apparent impertinences (Ab-Fabbish Masha, shellsuited Andrey, a Natasha with an Australian accent, a fusillade of F-words), his production is still true to Chekhov. \"It's faithful beat by beat,\" he insists. \"My notion of fidelity is about getting close to the raw nerves of the characters. The play was about contemporary people when Chekhov wrote it, and I wanted it to be about people as they are today.\" By moving it to the present \u2013 to avoid it becoming \"museum theatre\" \u2013 he hopes to make the image of a society standing on the brink of revolution resonate with our own experience of living in post-financial meltdown.</p> <p>When I meet Posner to talk about his Vanya, I immediately put the great samovar question to his cast. They say it will take its rightful place in what will be a more literal Chekhov than the&nbsp;other two. \"Well, it is in the script,\"&nbsp;argues West. \"And it was there in the very first production Chekhov did,\" adds Friel. \"You don't have to have silver birch trees with sun-dappled lighting coming through,\" says West. \"But you do have to have a samovar if people are going to talk about how cold it's got.\"</p> <p>Friel sneezes in sympathy. \"It's fine as long as you're using the stuff,\" continues West. \"Chekhov said you shouldn't have anything on stage you don't use. He said you're not allowed to hang a musket over the fireplace in act one unless you shoot it in act four.\"</p> <p>After spending an hour in his company, I can tell Stott will be perfect as Vanya, capturing both his world-weariness and mania. He exudes menace: you feel he could, if pushed, fire a pistol in anger. Posner is using a text by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/22/christopher-hampton-america-play-appomattox\" title=\"\">Christopher Hampton</a> that sticks closely to the original. \"I wanted something that was as faithful as possible,\" he says. \"I'm a purist.\" But isn't there a virtue in reimagining so familiar a landscape? \"I think one reimagines it anyway, if you approach a classic play as if it was new. Search in the right way and it will feel fresh. I've nothing against doing new versions, but I think you have to have a very good reason to do that with a great play.\"</p> <p>Stott reinforces the point with characteristic vigour. \"I remember walking past a poster for Winter's Tale,\" he recalls. \"It said, 'Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare \u2013 adapted by David Simkin.' Adapted? So, not good enough, is it?\"</p> <p>Why does Chekhov resonate so much with a British audience? Is it the preoccupation with class, the society in decline, the way emotions are held in check behind ritualised actions until they suddenly burst? Or is it just a love of costume drama, the Downton Abbey syndrome? \"I'd have thought the period dress is the least of those reasons,\" says Posner, \"but the first two are quite pertinent.\"</p> <p>\"We do feel Chekhov has a sensibility that is peculiarly English,\" says West, but he never gets to develop the point because Stott talks over him. \"It drives me absolutely stark raving fucking bonkers that Chekhov seems to have been commandeered by middle-class Englishness,\" says the Scot. \"I don't know why. 'Oh Chekhov, yes, that's us, you know.'\" He says this in a mock-English accent. \"It fucking isn't you. It isn't! It doesn't belong to the English middle class. In fact, quite the opposite \u2013 whatever is the opposite of the English middle class.\"</p> <p>The English, adds Posner, are accustomed to a subtext of repression and bleakness. \"But you don't find that in Chekhov,\" he says. \"Chekhov's&nbsp;rather front-foot. The characters often aren't aware of what they're doing and saying, but that's different from holding it in.\" They're not displaying boredom, Stott argues, but anxiety: \"If you play it as English middle-class boredom, you've got a&nbsp;firm grasp of the wrong end of the&nbsp;stick.\"</p> <p>\"It's not lethargic and it's not elegant,\" says Posner. \"It's something else.\"</p> <p>\"Something spiky,\" adds Stott, spikily.</p> <p>\"There is a life of the soul in Russia that doesn't exist in England,\" continues Posner; his cast are searching for that soul, for the Russianness of their characters.</p> <p>Friel, who turned down lucrative film work in the US to appear in Vanya, is approaching things in a way that would please <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/17/modern-drama-konstantin-stanislavsky\" title=\"\">Konstantin Stanislavsky</a>, who directed the play's Moscow premiere in 1899. She visited Moscow, went to the Chekhov Museum, and tells me to read About Chekhov, Ivan Bunin's memoir of his friend, which she says movingly portrays the playwright's determination to work in the face of the tuberculosis that was to kill him at the age of 44.</p> <p>While the rest of us ramble on, she texts a friend in Russia to get a native's view. Her approach to the young wife Yelena, a character sometimes misplayed as flighty or exploitative, will be nothing if not thoughtful. \"Chekhov asks so many questions but never answers them,\" she says.</p> <p>I ask Posner why he was so keen to direct Vanya. \"I've reached an age where I can understand the preoccupations,\" he says. \"The challenge of its complexity and delicacy is unsurpassed. I find it more challenging than Shakespeare.\"</p> <p>Stott recalls doing Chekhovian scenes at drama school and misunderstanding them completely: \"You have to reach middle age before you can understand a play like this.\" West agrees: \"If you are 25, life goes through every pore and there's lots of it ahead of you. But these characters are desperate because they feel life is slipping away, and they're looking for it at any level and any cost.\"</p> <p>With some trepidation, I read them Vakhtangov's press release dismissing the English way with Chekhov. They are unabashed. \"We're trying to achieve the same thing,\" says Posner. \"But we're keeping the samovar.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Three Sisters is at the Young Vic, London SE1, until 3 November. Posner's Uncle Vanya opens on 2 November at the Vaudeville, WC2. Vakhtangov's is at the Noel Coward, WC2, 5-10 November.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have published the full genetic sequences of more than 1,000 people from 14 countries, creating the most complete inventory of the millions of variations between people's DNA sequences ever assembled.

The pilot results from the project were<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/27/1000-genomes-project-genetic-variation\" title=\"\"> unveiled in 2010</a>, and the genomes of 179 people published to show that the technology and methods were robust.</p> <p>The five-year project, which cost around $120m (\u00a375m), is an international collaboration between scientists, charities and companies to map the full diversity of human DNA. It takes advantage of the rising speed and falling costs of sequencing machines.</p> <p>The first human genome, published in 2003, took more than a decade to complete, but the 1,000 Genomes Project completed the bulk of its sequencing work in less than a year. A genome can nowadays be fully sequenced in just a few days.</p> <p>The data now available to scientists contains 99% of all genetic variants that occur in the populations studied, down to the level of rare variations that only occur in 1 out of every 100 people. \"The whole point of this resource is that we're moving to a point where individuals are being sequenced in clinical settings and what you want to do there is sift through the variants you find in an individual and interpret them,\" said <a href=\"http://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/gil-mcvean\" title=\"\">Professor Gil McVean of Oxford University</a>, a lead author for the study.</p> <p>The information will be pored over by thousands of researchers, who will analyse and interpret the DNA variations between people in a bid to work out which ones are implicated in disease. In addition to the DNA sequences, the 1,000 Genomes Project has stored cell samples from all the people it has sequenced, to allow future scientific projects to look at the biological effect of the DNA variations they might want to study.</p> <p>One early insight from the project has showed how some of the rarest DNA variants tend to cluster in relatively restricted geographic areas. \"Within Europe, we think we're all pretty similar,\" said Prof McVean. \"But if you look at the rarest variants \u2013 those present at 0.1% frequency around the world \u2013 if you find two copies of these mutations, they're nearly always within the same country. At that kind of level, what you find in the UK is distinct from what you find in Italy, is distinct from what you find in Finland.\"</p> <p>These very rare variants are mutations that tend to do bad things to genes - they prevent a protein-coding gene from functioning by altering its sequence or affect the way in which is is regulated. \"It's these rare mutations that are likely to have the strongest effects, which are also likely to be the most geographically restricted,\" said Prof McVeaan. \"That's something we've documented for the first time in this work.\"</p> <p>Previous work to build up catalogues of differences in human DNA have involved a technique called the <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/20019523\" title=\"\">genome-wide association study</a>. Here, scientists look at DNA samples from thousands of patients for a particular disease, and compare their sequence with thousands of control samples from healthy volunteers, looking at hundreds of thousands of genetic differences in each sample. This has given scientists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jun/07/genetics.medicalresearch\" title=\"\">many leads for variations </a>implicated in bipolar disorder, Crohn's disease, heart disease, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and high blood pressure.</p> <p>In September, scientists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/05/genes-genome-junk-dna-encode\" title=\"\">published the results of the Encode project</a>, which sequenced the vast areas of the human genome that lie between the 2% that is protein-coding genes, that had once been dismissed as \"junk\". The focus in genomic research had largely been on looking for errors within genes themselves, but the combined results of Encode and 1,000 Genomes Project and others will help guide the hunt for problem areas that lie elsewhere in our DNA sequence.</p> <p>The next phase of the 1,000 Genomes Project will be completed when the scientists have sequenced an additional 1,500 people. \"The key thing with 2,500 [genomes] is not to get deeper in the existing regions but to spread the parts of the world in which we can achieve that level of coverage,\" said Prof McVean.</p> <p>\"At the moment there's big holes. In the data release so far there's nothing from the Indian subcontinent and that's something we need to fill. Many of the remaining samples [in the next batch] are from there. Likewise we need to do deeper sampling in Africa and that's an area we will fill in.\"</p> <p>Sir Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust \u2013 which part-funded the study \u2013 said: \"It is quite remarkable that we have gone from completion of the first human genome sequence in 2003 to being able to sequence more than a 1,000 human genomes for a single study in 2012. This study is an important contribution to our understanding of human genetic variation in health and disease and the DNA sequences are freely available for analysis and use by researchers.\"</p>",
  "<p>Wednesday's <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/current-cases/CCCaseDetails/case_2012_0142.html\" title=\"\">decision</a> by the UK supreme court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/31/supreme-court-rendition-uk-us\" title=\"\">in the case of Yunus Rahmatullah</a>, a man detained by the British in Iraq, might seem to be about the hallowed writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. In truth, its main significance may lie elsewhere. The court identifies this as the first instance in 150 years where the US has \"dishonoured\" an international agreement with the UK. As the US has given similar assurances in a spate of extradition cases in recent years, Britain must unfortunately ask the question: is the United States to be trusted?</p> <p>Rahmatullah, along with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/15/terror-suspects-afghanistan-bagram\" title=\"\">Amanatullah Ali</a>, was detained in Iraq by British forces in February 2004. They were turned over to the US pursuant to a 2003 memorandum of understanding (MoU) that gave the UK the right to demand their return if there was any violation of their Geneva convention rights. Ali had been erroneously identified \u2013 by the British and later by the US \u2013 as a man called Ahmad Dilshan, the leader of a Sunni extremist group called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Taiba\" title=\"\">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a>. This was simply fatuous. Ali is a Shia rice farmer and therefore could not have been a member of LET, let alone its emir. He had a perfectly innocent reason for being in Iraq, as the Shia holy sites there were accessible for the first time in many years after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Rahmatullah likewise denies being a member of LET, and no evidence has been produced to prove otherwise. Indeed, he was cleared for release by the US two years ago, reflecting a finding that he was no threat to anyone.</p> <p>The supreme court has ruled that the UK violated the Geneva conventions in various ways \u2013 it is, justices wrote, an \"extreme\" case. Rahmatullah should have been set free \"years ago\". The MoU provided that the US would return Rahmatullah to the UK upon demand, and the UK was bound to make that demand given the violations of Geneva.</p> <p>The UK government represented to the court that such a demand would be futile, because the US would not comply. The court was nonplussed by this argument. An MoU is \"a well-established and much used tool of international relations\". A nation \u2013 particularly a \"mature democracy\" such as the US \u2013 is not at liberty simply to ignore its commitment. Indeed, the court noted, the UK and the US have entered into many such arrangements in the past 150 years. \"Over this period\" \u2013 until today \u2013 \"there was no instance of any assurance having been dishonoured.\"</p> <p>In any event, the 2003 MoU merely reflected the international obligations imposed by the Geneva conventions, which the US signed on <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;ps=P\" title=\"\">12 August, 1949</a>. Yet \u2013 as predicted by the UK government barrister \u2013 the US simply refused to fulfil its agreement. Rahmatullah and Ali therefore continue to face illegal detention eight years on.</p> <p>What, then, does this case mean for other US-UK commitments? Can Britain trust the US to honour its promise to comport with human rights law, and not apply the \"death penalty to prisoners\" sent there for trial? Will the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19852506\" title=\"\">five Muslim prisoners</a> who were extradited four weeks ago end up in an execution chamber, notwithstanding US assurances to the contrary? Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/richard-o-dwyer\" title=\"\">Richard O'Dwyer</a> will end up in a Guant\u00e1namo cell for conspiracy to commit copyright infringement?</p> <p>The British government \u2013 pusillanimous as ever \u2013 thinks it is too sensitive a subject for us to ask the US why it is flouting an international agreement. The true explanation seems to be that the US and the UK have been caught committing another crime together \u2013 sadly one of a parade of conspiracies involving rendition, torture and targeted killings \u2013 and are now trying to evade the rule of law. As two justices noted: \"It may be that both the UK and the US would prefer to leave the problem with the US authorities, rather than face up to what the UK would do with the applicant if he were to be transferred to them. That again is not a factor which should impress the court.\"</p> <p>Indeed, it is not. Neither should it impress those of us who vote, or who care about justice.</p>",

The crowd cheered wildly as her defiant opponent battled back, forcing a 12-shot rally in the blistering heat.</p> <p>Eventually the seven-time Grand Slam winner clinched the game. Her challenger, nine-year-old Lola Holmes, was nevertheless thrilled.</p> <p>\"Venus is my favourite player. I was just thinking, wow, how am I even doing this when I was hitting the ball back. It was amazing,\" Holmes said breathlessly afterwards, clutching her racket and grinning from ear to ear.</p> <p>She was one of several dozen young children in Nigeria being coached for an afternoon on Wednesday by two of modern tennis' biggest stars. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/31/venus-serena-williams-womens-rights-nigeria-video\">Venus and Serena Williams kicked off an \"Africa tour\"</a> in promotion of women's rights that will take in Nigeria before moving on to South Africa.</p> <p>Hundreds packed the upmarket club in Lagos for the tennis clinic, braving the relentless heat as they squeezed into all available spaces. As the sisters, wearing bright pink and orange tops, tossed balls on the neat centre court, office workers hung out the windows of overlooking tower blocks and cheered the budding tennis stars.</p> <p>\"We're here to empower young girls and let them know that if you dare to dream, you can achieve any goal you want to,\" Serena said at an earlier press conference held by the Breaking The Mould initiative they are representing.</p> <p>The initiative is aimed at encouraging \"more women to break moulds that have stood between them and their potential,\" the organisation said in a statement. There are 80 million women in Nigeria, but gender disparity is an acute problem. Africa's most populous country ranks 118 out of 134 countries on the Gender Equality Index, according to a British Council study.</p> <p>\"We were able to break the mould when tennis was very dominated by white people. To have a face of colour come in and dominate showed it doesn't matter what your background is and where you come from, if you have dreams and goals, that's all that matters,\" Serena said.</p> <p>Looking visibly tired two days after beating Maria Sharapova to win the women's world tennis championships, she said the trip was special in other ways too.</p> <p>Lagos was the first African city she and her sisters had seen during a plane stopover in 1998, she recalled. \"We looked out the window and we were like, we finally made it to Africa. We definitely would love to see more athletes come out of Africa,\" she added.</p> <p>But she politely brushed off attempts to claim her as an African superstar, with one particularly enthusiastic journalist suggesting the specific Nigerian town where their ancestors may have been from. \"I'd love to say I'm from Africa, but we're from the United States and we're proud to be from there as well,\" Serena said.</p> <p>Venus said a planned exhibition match on Friday \u2013 their first match in Africa \u2013 would be a highlight. \"After all the finals everywhere \u2026 this will be our final in Nigeria,\" she said to cheers. \"I don't know who's going to win but Serena just won the championship so I know she's ready. I'll have to play my best tennis.\"</p> <p>At the lively press conference, the two sisters, who between them hold 22 major singles titles, also faced eager questions from a ten-year-old girl, Zuriah Oluwale, who quizzed Serena on whether she planned to fund any schools in Nigeria <a href=\"http://www.buildafricanschools.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:serena-williams-school&amp;catid=1:schools&amp;Itemid=3\" title=\"\">as she had done in Kenya in 2008</a>. \"I think it would be a good plan for the future,\" Serena said</p> <p>\"My next two questions are for Venus,\" Oluwale said, to which Venus jokingly quipped: \"I'm ready.\"</p> <p>The question \u2013 how Venus felt winning her first Wimbledon Grand Slam in 2000, two years before her questioner was born \u2013 threw into spotlight how far the sisters' have changed the game of tennis.</p> <p>\"Nigerians love tennis but there has been a lack of Nigerian role models since the early 1990s. It's possible some mothers saw the Williams playing, saw two black women being successful on the court, and maybe that made it easier for us as mothers to think our girls can play tennis seriously too,\" said Lagos resident Ebifegha Netimah, whose two teenage daughters \"want to be Venus and Serena\".</p> <p>While the theme of the tour was empowering girls, the Williams sisters appeal to young players of both genders.</p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Andrew learnt to play tennis after taking up work as a ballboy in an upmarket club. \"I used to go very early or late at night before anybody else was there and hit the ball with the other ball boys. We didn't have money so we used rackets from the sports shop, and then put them back before anybody caught us.\"</p> <p>\"I really like the Williams sisters. This week I was so excited they were coming, I forgot the tiredness, I just wanted to see them because I know it will encourage me to keep playing,\" said Andrew.</p>",

  "<p>The government's plans for a new generation of secret courts faced a fresh setback on Wednesday when its own human rights watchdog warned the proposals could be incompatible with the law.</p> <p>After taking advice from leading counsel, the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/\" title=\"\">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> told MPs and peers it believes that proposals within <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-the-essential-guide\" title=\"\">the controversial justice and security bill</a> are incompatible with the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>\"The government's proposals to extend the use of secret hearings to civil cases are a departure from this country's traditions of open justice and fairness,\" said John Wadham, the commission's general counsel.</p> <p>\"The process is incompatible with the Human Rights Act and the principle of a common law right to a fair trial, and there is no real evidence to show how the proposals would improve the justice system.\"</p> <p>The commission <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/legal-and-policy/parliamentary-briefings/justice-security-bill-with-advice/\" title=\"\">issued its verdict</a> on the Bill under its statutory duty to monitor and advise on proposed changes of law to ensure they meet human rights standards.</p> <p>The bill proposes to extend to civil trials of measures known as closed material procedures (CMPs), which not only exclude the public and media from courtrooms, but allow lawyers representing government ministers to introduce evidence that cannot be seen or challenged by a claimant or their lawyers. This will be permitted even when those ministers are themselves the defendants.</p> <p>The commission said it had concluded that CMPs are:</p> <p>\u2022 Incompatible with an excluded party's English common law right to a fair trial.</p> <p>\u2022 In breach of article 6 of the European convention on human rights, which protects the right to a fair trial.</p> <p>\u2022 To be used without any clear definition of the national security concerns they are said to be protecting.</p> <p>The government claims CMPs are needed to prevent courtroom disclosure of sensitive evidence from causing damage to the so-called \"control principle\" governing intelligence shared between states.</p> <p>It argues CMPs would allow more sensitive intelligence information to be heard in court than before, even though it would be heard in secret.</p> <p>\"Courts have found time and again that CMPs can be fair and can bring justice to an area of the law where currently there's none,\" a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said. \"It means courts will be able to hear cases \u2013 and see all of the evidence \u2013 regardless of how much information relating to national security is involved.\"</p> <p>The government says a judge would decide whether the information should be kept secret. However, the bill's critics say it has been drafted in a way that effectively ties judges' hands, making it extremely difficult for them to challenge any minister's claim that information should be kept secret on grounds of national security. The fact that a hearing would be held in secret could itself be kept secret.</p> <p>There is also concern that the bill is intended not only to protect the control principle, but to conceal evidence of government wrongdoing, particularly during civil claims brought by victims of torture or rendition since 9/11.</p> <p>Evidence of British collusion in the abuse and rendition of terror suspects to places where they risked being tortured \u2013 including evidence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/28/libyan-dissidents-action-government-rendition\" title=\"\">MI6's role in the rendition in 2004 of two Libyan dissidents</a> into Muammar Gaddafi's prisons \u2013 might not have come to light had the bill been in force.</p> <p>The commission also said it welcomes the bill's proposed reforms of the intelligence and security committee, the body of peers and MPs that is supposed to provide oversight of MI5 and MI6, but said they do not go far enough.</p>",
  "<p>Look closely at the image above. Do you get a chill down your spine? Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck? Cold Sweats? No? Me neither.

The rise of interest in spiritualism and psychic studies reached its peak in the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries and the Bostonian engraver and amateur photographer William H Mumler was the first to take advantage of this.

Not all people of the time were this gullible, Mumler was discredited at his trial for fraud in 1869: the legendary showman PT Barnum being the star witness for the prosecution produced his own spirit photograph that he had commissioned from a photographer to show how easy the images were to produce.

  "<h2><strong>Manipulating energy prices</strong></h2> <p>Threat of a \u00a3290m fine from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for allegedly attempting to manipulate the price of electricity in California between 2006 and 2008.

Barclays, which is fighting the accusations, is not the only player accused of manipulating Californian electricity prices, but not for the same reasons. Constellation Energy paid a $245m (\u00a3152m) record fine in January, while Deutsche Bank faces a $1.5m penalty and JP Morgan suspension for misleading regulators during an investigation.</p> <h2><strong>Manipulating interest rates</strong></h2> <p>Barclays was the first major bank to be fined for manipulating the benchmark Libor rate \u2013 initially to boost profits and later to protect its financial position \u2013 but it is unlikely to the be last. The Financial Services Authority has admitted it is looking at seven other financial firms and as many as 16 banks. Other firms are co-operating with regulators around the world.

Caterham, who face a heavy financial penalty if they fail to finish in the top 10 of the constructors' championship, have spoken to Marussia's Charles Pic and their test driver Giedo van der Garde, who can both bring sponsorship money to the team. \"The fact is, I don't bring money and I get paid,\" Kovalainen said on Wednesday. \"Whether that's the deciding factor or not, I don't know. At the moment there is no movement. I'm waiting on what Tony wants to do. He has different options and has to decide what route he wants to take.\"</p> <p>Caterham have confirmed that Van der Garde will drive in Friday's opening session in Abu Dhabi, his fifth first-session drive of the season and his fourth in a row.</p> <p>At Williams, Pastor Maldonado brings in \u00a330m from the Venezuelan state oil company, PDVSA, while at Lotus Romain Grosjean repays the patient faith the team have in him with money from Total.</p> <p>The financial position at Force India was the centre of some speculation during the Indian Grand Prix, following team principal Vijay Mallya's well publicised problems with his grounded Kingfisher Airlines. That must worry Paul Di Resta, who does not bring in any sponsorship deals, but he is too good a driver to let go.</p> <p>Force India are unlikely to name a replacement for H\u00fclkenberg until the end of the season. But there could be a return to the team for Adrian Sutil, who was ninth in the world championship last year before being replaced.</p> <p>Jules Bianchi, Force India's test driver, is also on the shortlist. Force India have a tradition of promoting from within the team.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Abu Dhabi, where Red Bull could lift the constructors' championship this weekend, Sebastian Vettel is poised to become the first driver to win five races in a row since Michael Schumacher in 2004. \"I hope we will sail on the tailwind of our four wins and add a fifth,\" he says.</p> <p>But, according to the McLaren team principal it has all been a little too straightforward for the German. Whitmarsh said: \"I think we made it all too easy for him [in India]. If you are at the front you can look after the tyres, you can look after everything. We needed to get up there and give him a harder time at the start and we were not able to make that stick.</p> <p>\"Jenson's start was very good, and our two guys were fighting each other and Fernando. I think having Fernando, Lewis and Jenson fighting over the first lap was probably the dream ticket for Red Bull to get away.</p> <p>\"If you can do that, running in clean air, with probably Seb not feeling too threatened by the car behind him, then that is it.\"</p>",

Only yesterday we were telling you about a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/30/little-green-cars-new-band\" title=\"\">Dublin five-piece</a> who specialise in spectral acoustica with an emphasis on the power of unison voices. Today's band, who only formed last March, also offer a four man-one woman configuration, only they're from the place that gave birth to this sort of music \u2013 LA. And this time the singing chores are handled not just by the male and female leads, but by four of the band members, who also randomly and wantonly swap instruments not just when they record but when they play live as well. Basically, they're all singers with pasts fronting their own projects, and they share lead and backing/harmony vocals, but they're also all multi-instrumentalists (apart from the drummer). On one number guitarist Robbie Arnett might move to keyboards, Marlana Sheetz will go from keys to bass, bassist Graham Fink might pick up a guitar, and guitarist Andrew Heringer will switch to banjo. In a way they're a bunch of backing musicians in search of a frontman/woman. Or to spin it more positively, they're four frontmen/women who provide their own back-up.</p> <p>And they're signed to Fierce Panda in the UK (Atlantic in the States), which we tend to associate with scratchy indie, not that there's anything wrong with scratchy indie, but this is far from that. Like Little Green Cars, they sound like a heartland American success already, a thought corroborated by their appearances on all the key late-night US talk shows, from Conan to Letterman. They're influenced by Crosby Still Nash &amp; Young, and you can tell from the sun-kissed harmonies, and by Fleetwood Mac, which shows in the airbrushed sonics and glossy sheen. They're Laurel Canyon with a dash of MOR. They're not <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/17/new-band-lady-antebellum\" title=\"\">Lady Antebellum</a>, that's for sure. They've toured with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/03/new-band-civil-wars\" title=\"\">Civil Wars</a> and are friends with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jun/03/new-band-local-natives\" title=\"\">Local Natives</a>, they recorded their debut album, due next year, with producer Ryan Hadlock (Ra Ra Riot, Metric, Islands), and live they perform covers of songs by Wilco and Sufjan Stevens.</p> <p>They may be polished, but they're playful. \"A collection of voices that live and breathe simultaneously with the breadth of an omniscient, collective consciousness\" is their way of describing what they do, while Milo Greene is, they say, their fictional moniker for the manager that they never had in the early days, so that when they would ring up and book gigs, they could pretend to be this suave yet tough character called Milo Greene. \"He actually has an identity,\" they explain. \"He's British. He wears a three-piece-suit. He wears a monocle. He's albino. He has chops, sideburns. He's confident, charming, well-read, well-spoken. He's a gentlemen, the kind of guy we all aspire to be.\" The name's Greene.

  "<p>During Hurricane Sandy, 750,000 New Yorkers lost electricity. I was one of them. I was alone in my apartment on the 17th floor eating popcorn and watching the news when the power went out. I don't own a radio. My fridge was filled with hummus and cottage cheese. The one piece of Bloomberg's advice that I took was to stock up. So I bought all the food I normally eat; only triple the amount.</p> <p>I immediately called the one person I could turn to in a crisis. It went to voicemail. \"Charlie,\" I said, it's Ariel. The lights have gone out.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the reason he wasn't available is because at that exact moment, 376 other people were trying to reach him.</p> <p>Charlie is the \u00fcber-super of my West Village apartment block. There are 21 floors and 376 apartments. Or, as he puts it: \"376 families.\"</p> <p>Not all buildings in Manhattan are like Trump Tower. Many are like mine \u2013 sturdy postwar structures that house hundreds of middle-class residents. Some of whom moved in when the building was built and never moved out. There are 20 men who work on staff \u2013 doormen, handymen, porters \u2013 and they've become surrogate family. Especially to those who don't have spouses or loved ones to turn to, they're the closest thing.</p> <p>Even before Sandy hit, these men were prepared to stay for the long haul. Most of them live in other boroughs with families of their own but slept in the basement on air mattresses so that they would be there when needed. After the building lost power, once they knew their own families were safe, they tended to the tenants without hesitation.</p> <p>They hauled gallons of water up 21 flights of stairs to elderly people who couldn't get out, checked in on every single apartment, passed out glow sticks and let people know they weren't alone.</p> <p>When I got down to the lobby, it was a hub of activity. The doormen were performing triage on some of the needier tenants: sorting out problems, offering reassurance, doling out information (\"You can get coffee at the 28th street deli\") and answering the same question over and over (\"I don't know when the power will be back on\") without sounding impatient. When a woman with an injured foot (16th floor) heard it might be days before power was restored, one of the doormen wearing his sweatpants put his hand on her shoulder and said, tenderly: \"We'll manage.\"</p> <p>Part therapist, part security guard, part medic, they supervised the frenzy and remained in control. They exuded thoughtfulness and concern and the gratitude from tenants was evident; expressed in various ways.</p> <p>Tenants offered to let them sleep on their couch (and not just because they wanted extra attention). Loads of them showed their appreciation with food. The lobby looked like a bake sale. Pans of pre-storm lasagne, brownies, pastries and tiny ham and cheese sandwiches. \"The high-end kind,\" Lucas, the handyman pointed out.</p> <p>For people in New York City apartment buildings, the prospect of going days without electricity and water and even worse \u2013 no internet \u2013 is more than an inconvenience. These tenants aren't Eagle Scouts; coping mechanisms are sparse. Many without options are staying put and the doormen and building staff come to the rescue. They keep everyone safe. They are the guardians of the fortress and, in my building, they are supremely devoted. \"That's how we are here,\" Charlie declares. \"I don't know about other buildings.\" They care about the residents, look after them, and take tangible pride in being the best at what they do.</p> <p>Which, when a crisis hits, is everything.</p>",
  "<p>More than one in three men surveyed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's war-torn east admits committing sexual assault, and three in four believe that a woman who \"does not dress decently is asking to be raped\", <a href=\"http://www.genderjustice.org.za/resources/doc_download/101471-preliminary-results-from-the-images-study-in-eastern-drc.html\" title=\"\">researchers have found</a>.</p> <p>Some 61.4% of men interviewed said women sometimes deserve to be beaten; 42.7% think that \"if a woman doesn't show physical resistance when forced to have sex, it's not rape\"; and 27.9% believe that sometimes women want to be raped.</p> <p>Well over 40% of the men polled asserted that a man should reject his wife when she has been raped.</p> <p>The findings show that sexual violence is much more than a weapon of war, activists said, and reflect widespread acceptance of patriarchal norms and rape myths. They also pointed to Congo's incendiary mix of conflict, poverty and weak law enforcement as causal factors in need of urgent redress.</p> <p>The study was carried out by the South African-based <a href=\"http://www.genderjustice.org.za\" title=\"\">Sonke Gender Justice Network</a> and the Brazilian non-government organisation <a href=\"http://www.promundo.org.br/en\" title=\"\">Promundo</a> in and near Goma in Congo's North Kivu province. A total of 708 men and 754 women aged between 18 and 59 took part in individual interviews and focus group discussions in June this year.</p> <p>The self-reporting of men is particularly unusual and striking. Some 34% admit having carried out some form of sexual violence in conflict, homes or other settings.</p> <p>Almost two-thirds agree with the statement that \"women should accept partner violence to keep the family together\", and almost a third endorse the view that \"a woman who is raped has provoked this by her attitude\". More than a quarter believe that \"a man can force a woman to have sex and she may enjoy it\".</p> <p>The preliminary report notes: \"In qualitative interviews, men openly shared their opinions about the 'right to have sex' with their female partner even if she refuses; most men did not consider it to be rape to force their wives to have sex with them. Other men took any 'provocation' by a woman to mean that she wanted sex.\"</p> <p>As an example, it quotes a 48-year-old man who said a girl entered his shop and asked for water: \"When a girl is asking for water in such a way, she wants sex. So I took her in the middle of my shop. I think she liked it because her body accepted me to enter.\"</p> <p>The study, part of the International Men and Gender Equality Survey, also suggests that many men are themselves victims of violence, including sexual violence, and shows a clear association between exposure to violence and increased likelihood of subsequent perpetration.</p> <p>It makes recommendations including far greater promotion of gender equality in schools and public policy and a massive campaign of psycho-social care for boys and girls exposed to multiple forms of violence at young ages.</p> <p>It is estimated that at least half a million women have been raped in eastern Congo since 1998, prompting the UN to brand it \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8650112.stm\" title=\"\">the rape capital of the world</a>\".</p> <p>Henny Slegh, Promundo's regional coordinator in the Great Lakes region and principal investigator for the new study, said: \"The whole world knows there is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/48-women-raped-hour-congo\" title=\"\">lot of sexual violence here</a>. We want to know why. The main thing we found is there are conditions of extreme poverty and conflict and an inadequate response by the national and especially international community contributing to the cycle of violence.</p> <p>\"Gender inequalities exist everywhere but many parts of the world live under better conditions. In this environment it is clearly worse. There are not educational opportunities to change these attitudes. That's what responses and interventions must focus on.\"</p> <p>But there are grounds for optimism, Slegh added, in the honesty and engagement of respondents. \"Men and women said: 'This is the first time I got asked questions where I can tell my story.' One man said he'd raped a girl a week before because he felt it was normal. He was exchanging opinions and it helped him see it another way. The men were very open and said they would like groups discussions more often.\"</p> <p>This was also welcomed by Micheline Muzaneza, a former Congolese child refugee who now works with victims at the Sonke network in Cape Town, South Africa. \"Men accepting and saying, 'Yes, I did this,' is a big step,\" she said. \"We need to work on that.\"</p> <p>Gender inequality is handed down through the generations, she continued. \"They think a woman must be in the kitchen, that a woman is like a child. The cultural attitude is that a man can beat a woman. They grew up like that, seeing their father beat their mother. To punish a rival armed movement, they say: 'Let's go and rape their women and show we are stronger than them.' The woman becomes an object.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.healafrica.org\" title=\"\">Heal Africa</a> runs a hospital for rape victims in Goma and recently<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/congo-rape-number-rise-rebels\" title=\"\"> reported a sharp increase in cases because of rising militia fighting</a>. Emmanuel Baabo, leader of its projects dealing with sexual violence, said: \"The attitude of the men who have been asked in this study is not acceptable. How can one think that a woman wants to be raped?</p> <p>\"But I am not surprised at the outcome of this survey. It shows the ignorance of many Congolese men and that in the Congolese culture women are still today often seen as inferior to men. This attitude is also a question of education. The more men are educated, the more they respect generally women.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The armed groups consider violence as a weapon of war. And [seeing] that the system of justice is not working correctly, the impunity makes the situation even worse.\"</p> <p>War in eastern Congo has killed and displaced millions over nearly two decades. At least half of those surveyed live below the absolute poverty line and hunger is a daily reality, with 40% of men and 43% of women having only one meal a day.</p> <p>Sonke is calling for for more engagement with men and women and a transformation of gender relations and social justice. Dean Peacock, its co-founder and executive director, said: \"On the question of whether men can change, the answer is certainly yes, including in Congo.</p> <p>\"There's also evidence that a range of interventions can speed that up: group education, mass media efforts, policy change, including the development and implementation of laws that sanction and deter violence, and disrupt the toxic combination of men's sense of entitlement to women's bodies and their sense of impunity for using violence against women.</p> <p>\"All of those interventions are needed desperately in Congo. There are fledgling efforts to engage men: the Congolese Men's Network, for instance, is working in Kivu to challenge men to speak out against men's violence. These must be supported and strengthened.\"</p>",

  "<p>Why would George Lucas sell Lucasfilm, and why would Disney buy it? In some ways, the answer is obvious: both parties see an opportunity to make money. Lucas gains billions of dollars in return for a company that has developed perhaps as far as he can; Disney gains the rights to exploit some of the most valuable media properties of the last 30 years. While this is undeniably true, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/30/disney-lucasfilm-star-wars-deal\" title=\"\">deal announced this week</a> can also be understood as the culmination of a long, complex relationship between Disney and Star Wars.</p> <p>According to most accounts, George Lucas never really expected the first Star Wars to be a hit when it was released in 1977. He had already shown a rough cut of the film to several of his peers, including Francis Ford Coppola and Brian De Palma, who had found it baffling (although Steven Spielberg reportedly saw its potential). Moreover, family films were not considered particularly viable in the 1970s, a decade better known for more violent and challenging movies. Lucas actually went on holiday when the movie was first released, to avoid exposure to negative reviews.</p> <p>We know now that Lucas had almost unwittingly made a movie that a whole generation had been waiting for, and American cinema is still very much in the shadow of Star Wars's astonishing influence and success. In fact, Lucas had made something very like a Disney film, when Disney itself was struggling to connect with its traditional audience.</p> <p>Disney had become a major company by producing films and other material for the relatively underexploited child and family audience in the 30s and, especially, the 50s. By the late 70s, though, the company was struggling, and its movies throughout this period, from The Rescuers, through The Black Hole and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/88057/tron\" title=\"\">Tron</a>, to Basil the Great Mouse Detective, lacked much of the sparkle and appeal that defined its earlier hits. By contrast, the film historian Peter Kramer <a href=\"http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=dec2001&amp;id=278&amp;section=article&amp;q=it\\%27s+aimed+at+kids\" title=\"\">has observed</a> that Lucas and his longtime collaborator Steven Spielberg became the defining film-makers of the age, by addressing Disney's core audience with a new generation of family-friendly adventures (and the American trade newspaper Variety actually described Spielberg's ET as \"<a href=\"http://www.templetongate.com/ebert-et.htm\" title=\"\">The greatest Disney movie Disney never made</a>\").</p> <p>Uncle Walt had built his entertainment empire on the back of child audiences in the 50s, and Lucas forged Lucasfilm in a similar way in the 80s. Of course, Disney eventually got back on track by the late 80s, and today is an almost unstoppable force in the business, but George Lucas showed them the way, and so there is a neat historical inevitability to the news that Lucasfilm will finally be subsumed by Disney.</p> <p>The move makes sense for Disney on multiple levels, and actually, their relationship with Lucasfilm has been growing closer for decades. <a href=\"http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/hollywood-studios/special-events/star-wars-weekend/\" title=\"\">Disneyworld already runs regular Star Wars weekends</a>, which connect the two brands in interesting ways. Lucas has also initiated a series of new developments which reconstitute the Star Wars for a new, younger generation of fans, by creating the <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/explore/the-clone-wars/\" title=\"\">Clone Wars TV</a> series, and handing over a great deal of creative control to supervising director Dave Filoni. There may be almost universal agreement that the prequel trilogy was a misadventure that highlighted Lucas's weakened creative powers and tarnished the brand in various ways, but those movies certainly didn't kill Star Wars, which exists today in a more slickly commercial form than ever before.</p> <p>Star Wars may have lost much of its magic for die-hard fans as a result, but it makes Lucasfilm seem much more suited to acquisition by Disney. The unexpected, handmade charm of the original trilogy has been replaced now by a glossy veneer of commerciality that defines many Disney products today. Star Wars today just \"feels\"s like something that Disney might be involved with (and I don't exactly mean this as criticism \u2013 for my sins, I rather like Clone Wars).</p> <p>As for Disney, acquiring Star Wars (and Lucasfilm's other productions) represents an opportunity to further extend its demographic reach to target male consumers of all ages. Over the past 15 years, Disney has been enormously successful at producing material for girls, through its <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/11/17/princess-power.html\" title=\"\">Princess</a> and <a href=\"http://www.toysrus.ca/refinement/index.jsp?categoryId=2567321&amp;f=PAD&amp;fg=Brand&amp;fv=Brand+Name+Secondary%2FDisney+Fairies&amp;fd=Disney+Fairies\" title=\"\">Fairies</a> brands. It has been less successful at targeting boys \u2013 although Pixars' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113137/cars\" title=\"\">Cars</a> was a cash cow for the company. Recently, Disney's acquisition of Marvel Productions seems to have been driven by a desire to expand its reach to older boys. Now, when you walk into a Disney store, you turn left for princesses and right for superheroes. Acquiring Lucasfilm continues this process, of developing brands with a broad sweep of demographic appeal (and I'm not for a minute suggesting that boys exclusively like cars, space and superheroes, or girls prefer princesses \u2013 rather that this kind of thinking motivates Disney's decision).</p> <p>It has ultimately acquired Lucasfilm partly because the companies have a longstanding creative relationship, but mainly to intensify its grip on consumers. In effect, the company just paid $4bn to ensure that now, when you walk into the Disney store, you just head straight on for lightsabers.</p> <p>\u2022 With thanks to my colleague the film historian Peter Kramer, who has comprehensively explored the relationship between Lucas, Spielberg and Disney; and with credit to my PhD student Charlotte Meakin, who was the first to observe, to me at least, that Disney acquired Marvel in order to better appeal to boys.</p>",
  "<h2>MADEJSKI MADNESS LEADS TO MCDERMOTT MADNESS</h2> <p>Last night, the Madejski Stadium was the scene of some unforgettable football, the like of which will probably never be played again. So all hail Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who during half-time of Arsenal's League Cup match at Reading, managed to hoof Dami\u00e1n Martinez, Carl Jenkinson, Johan Djourou, Ignasi Miquel, Laurent Koscielny, Theo Walcott, Francis Coquelin, Emmanuel Frimpong, Serge Gnabry, Andrey Arshavin and Marouane Chamakh around the dressing room, in perpetual motion off the walls, ceiling and floor, all 11 at once, non-stop for 15 minutes, issuing snippets of beneficial advice as he did so. That takes some doing, even when the funk-o-meter's cranked all the way up to Bootsy. Yep, unforgettable football.</p> <p>So well done, Ars\u00e8ne, and well done to Arsenal's players, who pulled their effing fingers out after their seminar with Prof Wenger and his Educational Hobnails, and put in a shift for at least the second half. Admittedly Reading assisted them by capitulating in the abject fashion, and Theo Walcott's regulation-time equaliser was scored in the 63rd of the four extra minutes added on by the referee, but a four-goal recovery is a four-goal recovery is a four-goal recovery. \"That's the first set to us,\" quipped Wenger after the eventual 7-5 extra-time win, as he polished and buffed his Big Persuasive Shoes, although that's technically the second set, because Arsenal beat Coventry 6-1 in the previous round. Celebrity fan Andy Murray, a gentleman tennis player who keeps an eye on the Gunners in order to ease the pain of supporting 1902 Scottish Cup winners Hibs, will probably not be particularly interested in that small statistical quirk, but let's say that he might be, because he does tennis and that.</p> <p>As for Reading, well, everyone has their off days, like Arsenal did when shipping eight at Old Trafford last season, or like Arsenal will when shipping eight at Old Trafford this coming Saturday, unless they get their act together sharpish. But nevertheless, having become the first-ever team to score five times in an English domestic cup game yet still lose, the crumbling Biscuitmen could take some time to get over this. \"It's embarrassing for us all,\" stuttered Reading boss Brian McDermott, who has given his players two days off to recover, during which they have been advised to go home and sit in the shower while holding their knees and rocking quite a lot. \"I might throw the DVD of this game in the bin,\" McDermott added, eschewing professional analysis in favour of going home and sitting in the shower while holding his knees and rocking quite a lot.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p><strong>7 May:</strong> \"To take over as a manager in a club with owners like that is madness.

Photograph: Dave Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hill/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The housing and redevelopment policies of the Conservative flagship Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) council first came to my attention in July 2009 due a campaign launched by a local Labour MP Andy Slaughter. Responding to the council's <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Planning_decent_neighbourhoods.asp\">core strategy options document and its proposals for constructing what it called Decent Neighbourhoods</a> and armed with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/jul/09/council-housing-social-cleansing-tories\">the yield from a Freedom of Information request</a>, he accused H&amp;F of \"<a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/plot-to-rid-council-estates-of-poor-6704870.html\">using the language of social cleansing</a>\" and of planning \"social engineering on a grand scale.\" </p> <p>Slaughter has continued to accuse the council of using housing policy to alter the social complexion of the area to the political advantage of the Conservatives, and the administration has continued to strongly deny such claims. However, Slaughter has long cited a Conservative Home article from February 2009 co-written by the then leader of the council Stephen Greenhalgh as further evidence to back his claim that, as he put it to me for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/22/london-council-tenants-earls-court\">an article I wrote in March</a> about opposition to the Earls Court project, the council has \"set out to gerrymander the electorate by reducing the amount of social housing in the borough and increasing the amount of high-value, mostly investment property.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2009/02/stephen-greenha.html#more\">Conservative Home article</a> is well worth reading. It is headlined \"Proposals for radical reform of social housing,\" and sets out the key arguments of <a href=\"http://www.localis.org.uk/article/82/Principles-for-Social-Housing-Reform.htm\">a pamphlet on the subject</a> that would be published that April, written by Greenhalgh and his fellow Conservative <a href=\"https://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=3490\">John Moss</a>, a chartered surveyor and regeneration specialist. </p> <p>Moss also co-wrote the Conservative Home article, which articulates with some skill a version of the argument that social housing is, as Greenhalgh and Moss put it, \"warehousing poverty in the core of our great cities,\" and should be broken up, partly in order to tackle social ills including educational underachievement, poor health and crime. It is an argument that has gained significant purchase in recent years and not only among Conservatives, although it fits very neatly with David Cameron's Big Society rhetoric which, at that time, was emerging as a theme of the pre-2010 general election period. </p> <p>However, the first six paragraphs of the Greenhalgh-Moss Conservative Home article were not concerned with the policy practicalities and claimed social benefits of the reforms they advocated, but the electoral implications of high levels of social housing for some potentially future Conservative MPs. It begins:</p> <blockquote> <p>On the day of the first Opposition social housing debate for three years, we ask here whether this is the time to reform social housing. It may not be an issue for the current intake of Conservative MPs at this time, but it will become an issue for many new MPs elected from target marginals which have far higher levels of social housing.</p> </blockquote> <p>The article then quoted from \"Figures supplied to Greg Hands MP from the Commons Library.\" Hands represents the constituency of <a href=\"http://www.greghands.com/\">Chelsea and Fulham</a>. Greenhalgh and Moss pointed out that, \"Some key targets have huge percentages.\" The first on their list was Hammersmith, the then newly created marginal seat that Slaughter was due to contest (and won). They went on to point out that, \"Whilst Conservatives are at a high point in local government, we still have a mountain to climb in our inner cities,\" and asked, \"Why is this?\"</p> <p>They continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>The current state and levels of social housing in our inner cities may provide part of the answer.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>And they elaborated:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Today social housing has become welfare housing where both a dependency culture and a culture of entitlement predominate. Two thirds of social tenants of working age are unemployed and only 22% are in full time employment. 50% of social housing is located in the most deprived 20% of the country. Competition revolves around drawing welfare support and taking something out of the system. Conservative principles of freedom, self-reliance and personal responsibility run counter to this culture. Calling for the state to provide a \"hand up instead of a hand out\" is unlikely to resonate.</p> </blockquote> <p>They then presented some statistics which, they wrote, \"might help explain the consequences of this for the Conservative party.\" These statistics were:</p> <blockquote> <p>Twenty Boroughs (excluding the City) have less than 25% social housing. Thirteen Councils are Conservative controlled, two are run by Conservative minority administrations, there is one Conservative/Lib-Dem coalition, three Lib-Dem run and one Lib-Dem/Labour run. </p> <p>The remaining twelve Boroughs have more than 30% social housing. Eight are Labour controlled, one Lib-Dem, two Lib-Dem/Conservative coalitions and just one, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Conservative run.\"<br>Only from this point in the article does the public policy case for social housing reform start to be made.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wrote to both Stephen Greenhalgh \u2013 now the head of <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/who-runs-london/mayor/mayoral-team/stephen-greenhalgh\">Boris Johnson's policing and crime office</a> \u2013 and John Moss, inviting them to refute Andy Slaughter's charge that their article betrayed a covert gerrymandering agenda informing their call for social housing policy reform \u2013 a charge anticipated by the authors in the article itself, where they write of \"the risk of a political backlash which has stymied the debate over social housing reform.\" They listed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3867387.stm\">Dame Shirley Porter</a> among, \"historical figures who must shoulder much of the blame for this.\" It should be noted that H&amp;F has said in the past that the pamphlet and the reform proposals are not the same as H&amp;F policy. </p> <p>I put it to Greenhalgh and Moss that beginning an argument for the radical reform of social housing by detailing the electoral disadvantages of the status quo for Conservative Party politicians seemed incongruous, and that setting out their reform proposals \u2013 which envisage practically all social housing being done away with and its occupants dispersing into the private rented sector \u2013 against that backdrop seemed to suggest a link in between those proposals and improving Tory electoral prospects. Finally, I invited them to explain to me why those who accuse them of having an electoral motive for wanting less social housing, particularly in marginal electoral areas, are wrong.</p> <p>I also wrote to Greg Hands, asking him to tell me why he had asked the Commons library for the statistics about social housing levels in parliamentary constituencies. I've yet to receive a reply from Hands, but both Greenhlagh and Moss have got back to me. Greenhalgh referred me to a recent article he wrote for <a href=\"http://www.estatesgazette.com/Home/\">Estates Gazette</a>, in which he again argues his case in favour of the Earls Court project - a major redevelopment proposal which H&amp;F says would maintain existing social housing numbers in that part of the borough but would also see the construction of many time more new homes for private sale in a very expensive part of London. Moss replied at greater length. Here's the bulk of what he wrote:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>When we wrote the article we expected the Conservatives to win a majority in the coming General Election, returning MPs in seats where there were higher percentages of social housing than in those seats Conservative MPs then largely represented. Our aim was to highlight to those campaigning in those seats we hoped to win why social housing policy was important to them and to argue for reforms which would increase opportunities for social tenants and start to tackle the evident levels of deprivation in areas with heavier concentrations of social homes.<br> I would refer you to pages 16 and 17 of <a href=\"http://www.localis.org.uk/article/82/Principles-for-Social-Housing-Reform.htm\">our pamphlet</a>, where we specifically bemoaned the fact that the overt politicisation of housing policy by Herbert Morrison, (\"Build the Tories out of London\") and Shirley Porter, (\"Building Stable Communities\"), had led to a reluctance among politicians to discuss reform. This has simply perpetuated the poor outcomes suffered by many people living in social housing, so thoroughly exposed by the Hills report and referred to many times by Sir Robin Wales among others. The sad fact is that those who suffer most from those poor outcomes are almost wholly disengaged from the political process, irrespective of how they might vote.</p> <p>I'm pleased to see that some of our recommendations have been followed, specifically the end of the HRA subsidy system and the extension of greater powers to Local Authorities to build new homes, both to rent and for low-cost home ownership. We need more homes and more affordable homes and as Hackney, Greenwich, Lambeth and Southwark Councils have all recognised, large scale estate regeneration is one of the best ways for Local Authorities to deliver this using assets they control, rather than relying on a private development market which is largely stalled.<br> Earls Court may be the largest and most ambitious such scheme in London, but at its core is the same desire to build more homes and to create more jobs for local people. That it succeeds where many other such schemes have failed; in delivering an increase in affordable homes and in ensuring all re-located tenants get to stay local, is a credit to the team that are delivering it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Does Slaughter's case stack up or has it been dismissed?

  "<p>One of the aspects of applying for teaching jobs which I get the most questions about is the personal statement. Do you need to write a letter of application in addition to completing the section in the application form which is entitled further information? My advice is simple, do both. One of the problems that many applicants have is trying to get their message across to the reader in the limited space that they have available so hence it is always a mistake to do one without the other. If you only complete one you may be struggling to keep your letter to a reasonable length or have a section of the application form that goes on for pages.</p> <p>Unfortunately some trainee teachers get so bothered about this aspect of the application that they slip up on other elements of their written application. So let's take a look at other parts of the form.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Completing the application form</strong></h2> <p>This should be the simplest part of the applying for a job but you would be surprised by how many applicants make a complete mess of the application form and in the current competitive school job market, the interviewer may only then give the letter of application a cursory glance.</p> <h2><strong>Electronic forms</strong></h2> <p>Nearly all schools will now provide an electronic copy of their application form. School leaders are expecting their new teachers to be ICT literate with solid skills ranging from using an interactive whiteboard to completing online reports. No matter how beautiful your handwriting, an application which is not word processed will immediately raise doubts in the interviewer's mind that you do not have the ICT skills required in today's schools.</p> <h2><strong>Dates</strong></h2> <p>The second most frequent error is the applicant who gets confused with some of their dates on the application form. This is an applicant's professional foul, as all interviewers will have completed their safer recruitment training and one aspect of this which is hammered home is that gaps in an applicant's history could raise safeguarding concerns. At the other end of the spectrum it just shows a slap-dash attitude. One suggestion is that before you start applying for jobs, complete a word processed document which has two sections: your previous employment history and your education/qualifications listed in reverse chronological order. If you spend a little time completing this list at your leisure when you are then rushing to complete an application form in between planning the next day's lessons you should be able to copy and paste the list line by line into the application form.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Don't leave any gaps</strong></h2> <p>If getting the dates wrong is a professional foul, then missing sections of the form really is a red card offence especially if the section you miss out is that where you have to disclose any criminal convictions. You would be surprised by the number of applicants who forget to complete this box when they have a completely clean criminal record and have nothing to hide. Yet again in today's safety conscious world, if you do miss that box out and the interviewer already has five strong applicants, then you may not make the shortlist for interview.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Further information</strong></h2> <p>As I suggested at the beginning of this article, the section of the form that can really make a difference to your application is the further information section. Where I always prefer to see a letter of application written in continuous prose, I am quite happy to see this section written in bullet points. Some of the best further information sections that I have seen are those who have taken the job description and tried to write notes on each point showing they have all the skills required by the school. If the interviewer is taking a very scientific scoring approach to shortlisting the applicants, by using this approach, you are making it much easier for them to check off that you are the ideal person for the job and the final signing for their team.</p> <h2><strong>Follow these golden rules</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Always try to word process your application form</p> <p>\u2022 Ensure there is something in every box</p> <p>\u2022 Double check that the dates in your employment history and education are correct</p> <p>\u2022 Ensure the further information dovetails with your letter of application</p> <p>\u2022 Include information from your letter and other additional information</p> <p>\u2022 Be prepared to explain any gaps in service</p> <p><em>Paul K Ainsworth is a secondary school head teacher in Leicestershire and the author of <a href=\"http://www.continuumbooks.com/books/detail.aspx?BookId=161940&amp;SearchType=Basic\">Get that Teaching Job</a>.<br></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>It cannot always have been easy to be the son of a celebrity as flamboyantly controversial as the writer and politician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/19/conor-cruise-brien\" title=\"\">Conor Cruise O'Brien</a>, but his son Donal, who has died aged 71, handled it with aplomb. He delighted in telling a story about being marooned on a grounded plane in Dublin when, falling into conversation with his neighbour, they exchanged names. At the sound of the famous surname, the man's face changed, and Donal braced himself for an onslaught on his father's latest d\u00e9marche. But the man was looking at him with a new respect. He was in fact an obsessive genealogist, and told him reverently: \"If you had your rights, you would be the Earl of Thomond.\"</p> <p>Donal did not succeed to the long-defunct earldom but became an interdisciplinary scholar of immense distinction whose work on the Mouride brotherhood of Senegal brought together history, political science and sociology in books such as The Mourides of Senegal (1971), Saints and Politicians (1975), Charisma and Brotherhood in African Islam (1988, with Christian Coulon) and Symbolic Confrontations: Muslims Imagining the State in Africa (2003).</p> <p>He was born in Dublin and left Ireland young, reading history at Peterhouse, Cambridge, before a doctorate in political science at Berkeley, California, and research in France and Africa. In his 39 years at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, he was a much-loved teacher and supervisor as well as a widely respected professor.</p> <p>Donal's international background conferred an ability to think his way into other cultures while maintaining an analytical distance. He also learned to cast a cold eye on political passions (and gave his father some much-needed advice on the subject, whether it was taken or not). Donal's work, with Julia Strauss, on politics as theatre (Staging Politics, 2006) may reflect this. His independence of mind enabled him to survive, and benefit from, intellectual mentors as diverse as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/sep/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Maurice Cowling</a>, Ernest Gellner, Michael Crowder and Roland Oliver. It also enabled him to confront multiple sclerosis, which first struck him in 1969, without a shred of self-pity.</p> <p>He had the indomitable support of his wife, Rita. Together they faced the challenges of his progressive disability with a determination never to compromise on the necessities of the good life. Whether in London, Dorset, California, France or Spain, they brought with them the best of conversation, food, wine, music and affection. Donal bore the recent rapid downturn in his physical condition with fortitude, always retaining his laconic wit and deep interest in other people. In his final months, he finished writing a vivid memoir of his life. During this last illness, asked how he felt, he replied: \"Lucky.\"</p> <p>He is survived by Rita, their daughter, Sarah, and two grandchildren, Lily and Joe.</p>",
  "<p>Afghanistan has fixed the date for its next presidential election, when voters will chose their first new leader in more than a decade, but even with 18 months to prepare, the government may struggle to tackle worries about security and fraud.</p> <p>The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said the vote would be held on 5 April 2014 after four months of campaigning. Elections to provincial councils will be held at the same time.</p> <p>Polls in 2009 and 2010 were marred by serious corruption, falling turnout and a rise in security problems as the Taliban targeted election booths, voters, poll workers and candidates.</p> <p>Afghanistan has been working on legislation and an electronic voter registration system to try to avoid fraud, and activists said a firm date and election timetable would make it easier to measure progress.</p> <p>\"The announcement of the calendar is a positive development and we certainly welcome this,\" said Ahmad Nader Nadery, chairman of the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, and a former commissioner on the country's Independent Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>\"There are other issues that are pressing now we have the date in front of us \u2026 for the IEC and the election to be trusted, and for people to go back and enthusiastically participate as voters and candidates, reform needs to be pursued much more aggressively.\"</p> <p>The vote will chose a successor to incumbent Hamid Karzai, who has run the country since the 2001 ousting of the Taliban, first as a nominated leader and then after winning two successive elections.</p> <p>The constitution bars him from running again, but there have been persistent concerns among some of his critics that he might try to alter the constitution to make way for a third term. A firm timetable could boost confidence that he plans to bow to the law, although he is expected to be heavily involved in the election.</p> <p>\"The question many people have been asking is whether Karzai is going to actually step aside and let someone else be president,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"The choosing of a date goes some way towards assuaging those fears.\"</p> <p>The United Nations welcomed the decision and committed to supporting the elections, and the US embassy described the date as \"more than a day on a calendar\".</p> <p>The US ambassador to Afghanistan, James Cunningham, said: \"It is symbolic of the aspiration of Afghans for elections which will be crucial for Afghanistan's future stability. This will be an Afghan process, with the US and the international community prepared to provide support and encouragement.\"</p> <p>That support is likely to be much needed, as the Afghan government tries to fill gaps left by foreign troops. In past elections Nato forces have helped with security at voting booths in places dominated or strongly threatened by the Taliban, and helped ferry ballot boxes, poll officials and voting papers between remote parts of the country.</p> <p>Many of those troops are due to leave by the end of 2014, and by April of that year will have limited resources.</p> <p>\"[The IEC] has had to compromise between the fact that the later it pushes the date, the less it has in terms of international security, and the earlier it hosts it the less time it has to get ready,\" said Barr.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri</em></p>",
  "<p>What can the UK government do about a terrorist suspect held indefinitely and apparently unlawfully by the United States? Not much, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/31/supreme-court-rendition-uk-us\" title=\"\">according to the UK supreme court</a> \u2013 even when the suspect in question was detained by British troops.</p> <p>On that, the court may well be right. But surely we could have tried a little harder? That's the view taken by two members of the court in a persuasive minority judgment.</p> <p>The man whose fate has been considered at three different levels by a dozen of the UK's most distinguished judges is Yunus Rahmatullah, 29, a Pakistani citizen. He was detained in February 2004 by British troops operating in an area of Iraq under US control, nine months after the end of major combat operations.</p> <p>Rahmatullah is believed by the US to be a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a proscribed organisation affiliated to al-Qaida. The US says he travelled from Pakistan to Iraq \"for the express purpose of engaging United States and coalition forces in hostilities\".</p> <p>Within a few months the US transferred him to Afghanistan. He has now been held in detention at Bagram air base for more than eight years. <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/cases/yunusrahmatullah/\" title=\"\">According to the legal action charity Reprieve</a>, which has been working for his release, he is in a \"catastrophic mental and physical shape, and now spends most of his time in the mental health cells\".</p> <p>The US says it is willing to return him to Pakistan provided \"appropriate security assurances\" can be provided. His continued detention suggests Pakistan has been unable to provide them.</p> <p>On behalf of Rahmatullah's family, Reprieve instructed lawyers to seek a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum et recipiendum (literally, \"that you have the body for submitting and receiving\"). As the Latin suggests, the writ has its origin in the Middle Ages. In simple terms, it requires anybody who is detaining a prisoner to justify that detention. Originally, the prisoner had to be brought before the court; since about 1780, the decision on release has been made in the prisoner's absence.</p> <p>It is a powerful writ, summed up by Lord Kerr, who gave the <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2012_0033_Judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">leading judgment</a>, in two pithy sentences:</p> <blockquote> \"If your detention cannot be shown to be lawful, you are entitled, without more, to have that unlawful detention brought to an end by obtaining a writ of habeas corpus. And a feature of entitlement to the writ is the right to require the person who detains you to give an account of the basis on which he says your detention is legally justified.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>Habeas corpus is a flexible remedy and the writ doesn't have to be addressed to the individual guards who are detaining a prisoner. All that's necessary is for it to be sent to someone who is in a position to order the prisoner's release.</p> <p>And who might that be in this case? For the writ to work, it must be someone within the court's jurisdiction. That jurisdiction clearly includes the UK government. Equally clearly, it does not include the US authorities.</p> <p>So Rahmatullah's lawyers had to persuade the courts that the UK had some say in whether he should be released. They based that on a memorandum of understanding signed by the US, Australia and the UK in March 2003, three days after hostilities had begun. That gave the UK a say in the transfer of prisoners from Iraq, although it turned out that Rahmatullah was transferred to Afghanistan without the UK's knowledge.</p> <p>The supreme court provides detailed analysis of that agreement in its <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2012_0033_Judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">judgment</a>. Kerr concludes that there was ample reason to have believed that a request by the UK government for Rahmatullah's return would have been granted by the US, not least because he was entitled to the protection of the Geneva convention governing prisoners of war.</p> <p>That was the view <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/14/bagram-jail-detainee-yunus-rahmatullah\" title=\"\">taken by the court of appeal</a> last December. So the supreme court unanimously dismissed the government's appeal against that decision.</p> <p>In the supreme court's view, Rahmatullah's continued detention by the US authorities is \u2013 on the face of it \u2013 unlawful. But the US does not regard the Geneva conventions as applicable to al-Qaida combatants. And it refused to grant the request made by the UK for Rahmatullah's return to UK control. Instead, the US said it was considering a request from Pakistan for him to be sent there.</p> <p>Given that approach, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/23/yunus-rahmatullah-cannot-be-freed-habeas-corpus\" title=\"\">court of appeal said in February</a> that there was nothing more it could do. In legal terms, there had been a \"sufficient return to the writ\". That decision has now been upheld by a majority of the supreme court.</p> <p>The leading judgment in the court of appeal had been given by Lord Neuberger, who has since become president of the supreme court. As he said in February, the \"melancholy truth\" was the UK authorities had \"sold the pass\" when they handed their prisoner over to the US.</p> <p>Obviously, Neuberger had no say in the supreme court's decision. But his earlier ruling failed to persuade two of his new colleagues, Lord Carnwath and Lady Hale. They said the UK should have put more pressure on the US:</p> <blockquote> \"The governing consideration for the court should be that the applicant remains in detention in Afghanistan, many years after the conflict in Iraq ceased, and after Geneva convention IV (as seen through British eyes) required him to be released. He has now also been assessed by the US detainee review board as suitable for release \u2026 In our view, the court should not rest on an inconclusive response [from a US government official], but should require the resubmission of the request in terms specifically relying on the UK's continuing responsibility under Geneva convention IV and its continuing rights under the memorandum of understanding.\" </blockquote> <p>This, of course, would have annoyed the Americans. It probably wouldn't have made any difference. But it was surely worth a try.</p>",

Six survivors were rescued by local fishermen, local activists said.</p> <p>The shipwreck is the single most lethal incident linked to the ongoing clashes between the Muslim Rohingya minority and local Rakhine Buddhists in Burma's Arakan state. The death toll has reached 80 in the last 11 days, according to official estimates. Thousands of homes have also been destroyed, along with places of worship.</p> <p>Exact details of the wreck are unclear. But there were fears it could fuel further communal violence, which itself threatens to jeopardise the reform process in Burma. Last week <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-Moon\" title=\"\">UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said</a> that \"the vigilante attacks, targeted threats and extremist rhetoric must be stopped [or] \u2026 the opening up process being currently pursued by the government is likely to be jeopardised\".</p> <p>The crisis has also posed a major challenge to Nobel laureate and pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been criticised for failing to speak out strongly enough on the issue. Her National League for Democracy party has remained silent since releasing a brief statement on 24 October.</p> <p>\"[Aung San Suu Kyi] has an obligation to do something about the crisis but for some time she has been silent,\" said Abu Tahay, a Rohingya politician in Yangon, the country's commercial and cultural capital.</p> <p>A first round of violence in June led to 75,000 people, mainly Muslims, fleeing their homes. The clashes over the last 10 days have forced nearly 30,000 more from their villages, according to the United Nations. The vast majority are Rohingya, who are not recognised as citizens of Burma and suffer widespread discrimination. Ethnic Rakhine communities have also suffered.</p> <p>\"I am very worried about the coming weeks. The situation is very unstable. In five minutes the violence could be everywhere,\" Abu Tahay said.</p> <p>On Wednesday a standoff continued on Ramree Island, close to the centre of recent clashes, as security forces attempted to protect Rohingya villages from crowds of local Rakhine.</p> <p>About 7,000 new refugees, including many who had been living on boats for several days, landed near the port town of Sittwe on Tuesday, NGO workers said.</p> <p>Many had been forced to leave their homes in the town of Kyauk Ni Maw, where the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman, allegedly by Muslims, in May sparked the sectarian violence that engulfed much of the state the following month.</p> <p>Hundreds have taken to boats or sought refuge on unpopulated coastal islands over recent days, refugee sources said.</p> <p>Neighbouring Bangladesh, which already has an estimated 300,000 Rohingya refugees, has closed its border, an act which activists claim violates international law.</p> <p>Rohingya campaigners on the Bangladeshi side of the border contacted by the Guardian said they had seen boats full of refugees offshore which were unable to land despite running low on water and food.</p> <p>Thousands of Rohingya try to leave Burma by boat every year. Many vessels are unseaworthy and every year several sink.</p> <p>Chris Lewa, an activist who tracks the ships, said that about 7,000 made the journey from Burma to Malaysia, often via Thailand, during the 2010-2011 sailing season.</p> <p>\"They are often loaded out to sea and, though some are in better condition than others, they are all packed,\" she said.</p> <p>Refugees pay between $1,700 (\u00a31,000) and $2,000 for a place but usually only put down a $400 deposit.</p> <p>Experts say the crisis is rooted in ethnic and religious tensions that were suppressed during nearly 50 years of brutal military rule.</p> <p>Hand grenades were thrown on Sunday night at two mosques in Karen state in the east of the country, causing no casualties, domestic media reported.</p> <p>Some of those now fleeing their homes were Burmese Muslims from the officially recognised Kaman minority. \"It's the first time that we've seen the Kaman targeted. That's very worrying,\" said Mabrur Ahmed, of Restless Beings, a UK-based human rights group.</p> <p>The UN estimate there are 800,000 Rohingya in Burma. Although many have lived in the country for generations, they are considered illegal immigrants and face widespread hostility.</p> <p>In June President Thein Sein suggested the best solution to the violence was that the UN resettle Burmese Rohingya outside the country.</p>",

  "<p>In May 2012, <a href=\"http://socialenterprise.guardian.co.uk/social-enterprise-network/2012/may/14/ivy-house-save-local-pub\">I wrote an article</a> about my community's fight for the continued existence of our local pub, the <a href=\"http://www.ivyhouselondon.com/\" title=\"\">Ivy House</a> in Nunhead, south-east London, following the eviction of its tenants by the freeholder, Enterprise Inns. At the time of writing, we had formed a steering group, gathered strong community support on Facebook and Twitter, investigated the advantages and disadvantages of co-operative ownership as opposed to ownership by a private limited company, and started to finalise a business plan with a view to seeking private investment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.enterpriseinns.com/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">Enterprise Inns</a> were originally looking for offers in the region of \u00a3650,000; they eventually sold the pub for just under \u00a3500,000 to a property developer who, a matter of weeks after purchasing it, put it back on the market for sale at auction on 29 October 2012, with a guide price of \u00a3750,000, although he had done no work to the pub in the intervening period. The pub had been closed and empty since April and the purchase price was spiralling further out of our reach. However, we have been able to make use of sections of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Localism Act 2011</a> to give ourselves what might be a last chance to see the Ivy House open for business again.</p> <p>Chapter 3 of the Localism Act came into force in September 2012. This allows communities to apply to their local council to have a building listed as an 'asset of community value'; the council can approve the listing if it considers the building's current use (or use in the recent past with a prospect of being revived) \"furthers the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community\" and is likely to continue to do so.</p> <p>With assistance from the <a href=\"http://www.peckhamsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Peckham Society</a>, the Ivy House is now one of London's first assets of community value: Southwark Council listed the pub just in time to prevent its sale at auction.</p> <p>However, the pub remains closed. How has the Localism Act helped our campaign, and how could it help other communities in a similar position as us?</p> <p>It has certainly bought us time. The objective of the act is to allow communities time to put together a bid to buy an asset. Our successful application to Southwark means that a moratorium of 6 weeks is now in force, during which time the pub cannot be sold. If we notify Southwark of our intention to prepare a bid to buy the pub then a further moratorium of 6 months then comes into force to allow us time to prepare our bid.</p> <p>The Act has also added a further layer of protection to a building that has already been Grade II listed by English Heritage. Where land is included in a local authority's list of assets of community value, it remains on that list for 5 years whether the community bids for it or not. The fact that it is on the list will be treated as a 'material consideration' for planning purposes. This means that it should be taken into account by the Council in deciding a planning application (including for change of use) or an appeal against a planning decision. It is also possible that this will reduce the development value of the pub further and therefore drive down the price of the freehold.</p> <p>However, our use of the Act has also raised further questions about how feasible its provisions are in central London.</p> <p>One difficulty is that, as a new piece of legislation, it is not clear how councils will implement it. Southwark, along with other councils, has yet to issue guidance on the format of applications for inclusion of land on its list and what evidence they require in support of an application. The Localism Act leaves it up to councils to formulate their own regulations to govern how the act operates in practice, for example in relation to modification and removal of assets from its list. It is also up to the council to define \"community interest group\" for the purposes of the right to bid provisions.</p> <p>The Localism Act provides communities with a right to bid for assets considered to be of community value. It does not provide a right to buy or a right of first refusal, and any bid that the community produces will have to compete on the open market with other interested parties. The objective of the Act is to create a level playing field by allowing communities time to put together a competitive bid; it is not intended to prevent property owners from obtaining the best price they can from whoever they can on the open market. It is hard to overstate the difficulty we face with prohibitively high property prices in London.</p> <p>The current owner wants to sell the pub for approximately \u00a3750,000. With the best will in the world, the chances of the local community raising that kind of purchase price plus stamp duty and the additional costs needed to carry out urgent repairs necessitated by years of under-investment in the fabric of the building are extremely slim, even taking into account the possibility of bank finance underwriting the value of community shares. There is no prospect of a commercial mortgage, at least in the first year or 18 months.</p> <p>The six month moratorium is triggered by a notification from a 'community interest group', meaning our bid will probably have to come from a community interest company or from a co-operative. Both have limited appeal to private investors. The dividend cap and asset lock imposed on community interest companies means that the majority of finance will probably have to come from within the community itself. When people are already facing soaring rent and house prices it is hard to see where the money could be found. There is also the concern that while the moratorium is in place, we might be hamstringing a buyer from outside the community who does have finance and wants to run a pub.</p> <p>The successful application to have the pub listed as an asset of community value is a great step forwards. But at best it is the start of a tough road ahead of us, not the end.</p> <p><em>Tessa Blunden is a solicitor and member of the steering group attempting to buy The Ivy House.

  "<p>Despite her reputation as a \"romantic novelist\", a label the author herself always chafed against, <a href=\"http://www.dumaurier.org/\" title=\"\">Daphne du Maurier </a>wrote two of the most menacing tales of 20th-century fiction \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/may/05/fiction.daphnedumaurier\" title=\"\">The Birds</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/22/dont-look-now-daphne-du-maurier\" title=\"\">Don't Look Now</a>. Bearing out the perceived wisdom that short stories \u2013 in particular, scary stories \u2013 make the best films, these short masterpieces are better-known today as the movies they inspired: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/jul/31/my-favourite-hitchcock-the-birds\" title=\"\">Hitchcock's infamous 1963 avian thriller</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/oct/22/dont-look-now-roeg-horror\" title=\"\">Nicholas Roeg's darkly erotic 1973 Don't Look Now</a>. (Du Maurier hated the former, apparently, disapproving of the many liberties Hitchcock took, but gave her blessing to Roeg's more faithful version of her later story). Deeply unsettling as these films are (a line of birds on a climbing frame, or a glimpse of a little girl's red coat), the stories can be equally chilling on the page \u2013 if not more so.</p> <p>Du Maurier's are not supernatural tales (she doesn't do real ghosts, so to speak); what could be more unnerving than nature behaving unnaturally? Not in the form of apocalyptic diseases, or storms and floods, but wreaking havoc through something as everyday and unthreatening as hedgerow birds. Environment is everything in Du Maurier's fiction, from the sinister alleyways of Venice in Don't Look Now, to the wilderness of her beloved Cornwall, where, like nearly all her most famous work, The Birds is set. In transposing the action to the tamer shores of northern California (no wonder Du Maurier was miffed), the film loses some of the elemental potency of the tale. And there is no place for the icily immaculate Tippi Hedren, fresh from the city, in Du Maurier's vision: as in Don't Look Now, the story is narrated entirely from the perspective of the male father figure \u2013 both stories deliberately set the rationality of their outlook against the irrational goings-on around them.</p> <p>The story starts quietly enough. Nat Hocken, a part-time farm labourer, is eating his lunch (a pasty, naturally) on a cliff on the Cornish peninsula, watching the restless birds gathering in the autumnal skies above him and enjoying the last glow of the sun. \"No wind, and the grey sea calm and full. Campion in bloom yet in the hedges, and the air mild.\" But Hocken, a man of the soil, alive to the fickleness of nature, senses that the weather is about to turn, that winter is coming and that it will be a hard, black one. \"Make haste, make speed, hurry and begone,\" he thinks to the birds, in an ominous line straight out of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/21/grimms-fairy-tales-philip-pullman\" title=\"\">Grimms' fairytale</a>.</p> <p>Later that evening, tucked up in bed next to his sleeping wife (nameless throughout), he is filled with a sense of apprehension and foreboding, like John at the beginning of Don't Look Now, suddenly \"aware of misgiving without cause\". The tension, like the birds' presence, is masterfully built through careful accretion. There is a tapping on the window (that ghost story staple!) and when Nat goes to investigate a bird nips him on the knuckles, but he goes back to bed without giving it a second thought. The tapping returns, this time more forcefully, waking his wife. Now there is not one bird on the sill but half a dozen. This time when he tries to shoo them away they attack him, pecking at his eyes. In a pattern that is repeated throughout the story, his wife doesn't believe him at first.</p> <p>Then there is a terrified cry from their children's bedroom. The room is full of birds, and Nat feels \"the beating of wings about him in the darkness\" (just reading it makes you inwardly flail and cower) as he beats the birds to death with a blanket. In the \"cold, grey morning light\" the floor is strewn with the tiny corpses of almost 50 birds, all small species \u2013 \"robins, finches, sparrows, blue tits, larks and bramblings, birds that by nature's law kept to their own flock and their own territory\". Nature's law has been broken and Nat immediately divines some sort of intelligence or purpose among the birds in their \"battle\" against people.</p> <p>Over the next 30 or so pages the birds continue to multiply, by the hundreds and thousands until the sky is black with them, and the species grow in size and malevolence: first small garden birds, then rooks, crows, jackdaws, magpies, jays; then gulls and gannets; finally, and most horribly, the birds of prey \u2013 accompanied by the ever-increasing sounds of tapping, stabbing, scratching, rasping, tearing, shuffling and beating. The sickening cacophony of the birds in attack is starkly contrasted with the eerie silence of them in abeyance, as Nat, a country man, is quick to link their sorties with the turns of the tide. During these brief respites, he must survey the damage and shore up the house against the inevitable next attack.</p> <p>This is the story of one man trying to protect his family from the external world as he barricades every window, doorway and chimney. The sense of nature being turned upside down is made clear when the little boy remarks that it is night-time at two o'clock in the afternoon, so dark is it in their stone cottage. The only other characters are a neighbouring farmer, his wife and a farmhand \u2013 all gruesomely punished for their flippancy towards the birds.</p> <p>The film doesn't quite capture the same palpable sense of isolation and claustrophobia. The homeliness of the interior \u2013 \"the cups and saucers neatly stacked upon the dresser\u2026 his wife's roll of knitting on her basket chair, the children's toys in a corner cupboard\" \u2013 and their comforting everyday meals \u2013 tea and cocoa, toasted cheese and soup \u2013 serve only to heighten the sense of chaos and danger outside. Nat's attempt to disguise his own fear and create some semblance of order \u2013 add to the terror. \"Manners Johnny\", reproaches the little boy's sister one mealtime, even as the birds begin to thud against the windowpane with renewed urgency.</p> <p>\"Someone should know of this\u2026 They ought to do something\" is a refrain that echoes throughout the story. Perhaps the most chilling moments of all are those when we realise that people in authority do know, and \"they\" are doing something \u2013 but that all attempts are futile. You know you are in trouble when even the BBC goes silent \u2013 something, Nat observes, that didn't even happen during the war.</p> <p>Du Maurier passes no opportunity to mention the war: Nat banks up the house like an air-raid shelter; fighter planes set off across the channel to be tragically outnumbered and end in burning heaps on the cliff tops, and the birds flying \"in formation\" towards land. In a nod to the Cold War era in which it was written: \"The Russians have poisoned the birds,\" reports the neighbouring farmer's wife of the town's gossip.</p> <p>There is no explanation for the nightmarish events, not why the birds began their own merciless war, or when, if or how it might end. It's an unconsoling ambiguity that Hitchcock, apparently after some indecision, did not attempt to resolve in the film, to chilling effect. Like Don't Look Now, the story closes with terrible banality.</p> <p>If you only know the film version, track down a copy of Du Maurier's collected stories. And if you are already familiar with the story itself, dig it out again. What better time to reread it than just as the weather has turned arctic, and the promise of a hard, black winter is upon us?</p>",
  "<p>Parents up and down the country will be rushing to get their hands on web-shooting Spider-Man figurines, a Nerf gun that can hit victims up to 75ft away, and ghoulish dolls such as Frankie Stein and Draculaura, if predictions for the most sought after toys this Christmas are to be believed.</p> <p>The baker's dozen of 13 dream toys chosen by the <a href=\"http://www.toyretailersassociation.co.uk/\" title=\"TRA website\">Toy Retailers Association</a> (TRA) also feature new spins on old classics. These include a Lego version of the Mines of Moria sequence from the Lord of the Rings films and an electronic dance version of Hasbro's popular family game Twister.</p> <p>Other names parents may remember from their own childhoods include Furby and Cabbage Patch Kids.</p> <p>The 13 toys \u2013 the two tablet computers on the list are so similar that the TRA added them both to the annual list of 12 \u2013 were whittled down from a longlist of 79 toys by the trade body for toy retailers. Gary Grant, chairman of the selection panel, said: \"There are some toys that hold an enduring place in the hearts of children for generations, and this year we've seen the toy industry come up trumps by reinvigorating these classic favourites for 2012.</p> <p>\"We also continue to see technology being woven into toys to add extra dimensions to the play experience \u2013 whether this is the use of apps, interactivity, touch screens or integrated multi-functions such as e-readers and cameras.\"</p> <p>At the Dream Toys exhibition in Marylebone, London on Wednesday, toy manufacturers exhibited their beeping, flashing products to hordes of children desperate to get their hands on the controls of gyrocopters and weaponised robots. Among them wandered people dressed as a giant Cabbage Patch Kid, a Sylvanian Family hedgehog and Lock from the Monsuno range.</p> <p>Ben, 10, said he was impressed by the new range of Star Wars-themed Angry Birds plush replica heads. \"I like the pig Clone Trooper the best. You could make videos of them, you could move them around and you could also just have them up in your bed,\" he said. \"</p> <p>Bella, 9, said she was so excited about attending the exhibition that she couldn't sleep the night before. \"I kinda like adventure toys like Skylanders,\" she said. \"I also like detective toys and I want to be a secret spy when I grow up. I love the Attacknid robot because it's really cool. It's like a video game come to life.\"</p> <p>As one child spoke to me, a dart from a Nerf gun barely missed her head. I retreated to the Lego and Playmobil stands \u2013 a relative oasis of calm. Drew Brazier, managing director of Lego UK and Ireland, said his products remain popular because \"they allow children to be creative. Lego is a classic toy. You can build what's on the front of the box or you can break it down and build something from your own imagination\". Brazier said the 80-year-old company had its \"best ever year\" in 2011.</p> <p>The old classics aside, technology-heavy toys vyed for attention throughout the exhibit: from Bandai's Techpet (which allows you to slot your iPhone into a plastic dog in order to control him via an app) to Mattel's Hot Wheels car that doubles as an interactive iPad game when placed on a tablet (\"toy meets tablet\", the exhibitor proudly announced).</p> <p>But technology often comes at a price that may be too steep for many parents this Christmas. The UK toy market is the biggest in Europe, worth \u00a32.9bn in 2011, with Christmas responsible for \u00a31bn or 34% of annual sales. The TRA said 110m toys were sold for Christmas 2011, at an average spend of \u00a39.21 each.</p> <p>Most toy representatives at the exhibit said price was not the true measure of value, the more important factor being \"play value\". \"We have a wide range of prices from \u00a31.99 mini-figures you can buy with your pocket money to \u00a369.99 for our Lego Friends house, which would be a big gift at Christmas,\" said Brazier. \"The value depends on how much play you get out of it.\"</p> <p>\"Furbies are good value for what you get,\" said a Hasbro spokeswoman, before adding \u2013 many parents may consider ominously \u2013 \"a Furby isn't just for Christmas, it's for life.\"</p> <p>Grant said that the majority of the toys on the list are what children would consider \"their main Christmas present\". He added: \"Most of the toys that made our list have smaller ranges, so children can use their pocket money to build a collection, then maybe ask for the big toy at Christmas. These are the key items under the Christmas tree, but we have items for all budgets.\"</p> <p>The cheapest toys on the main list are the Monster High range of Ghouls Rule dolls, retailing at \u00a322.99 each (\u00a317.99 at Smyths Toys). The most expensive is the LeapPad 2 tablet computer, which has a RRP of \u00a389.99 (currently \u00a369.87 at Smyths).</p> <p>Grant said his list of toys was the only truly independent one in the industry: \"It's a completely impartial list, with not one single retailer involved and not one single manufacturer \u2013 that's why it's so popular.\"</p> <p>Amazon UK's own list of top toys still mirrors the TRA's. the odd exception aside, such as Emotion Pet Cherry the Cat, Monopoly Millionaire, Star Wars Scalextric, and My Little Pony. Its toys and games expert, Ulrike Wingenter-Davey, said: \"Early buying indications for the festive season lead us to believe that educational devices such as the Vtech InnoTab 2 and LeapFrog LeapPad 2 Explorer Tablet will be popular choices for customers this Christmas.\"</p> <p>But there is arguably nothing on either list to rival the yuck factor of one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/26/top-christmas-toys-2011-doggie-doo\" title=\"\">last year's crop \u2013 the Doggie Doo</a>, a plastic dog that poos out plasticine. \"It's still selling incredibly well,\" said a spokeswoman for Ideal toys.</p> <h2><strong>The top 13 in full</strong></h2> <p>Cabbage Patch Kids, JAKKS Pacific, RRP \u00a329.99</p> <p>Furby, Hasbro, RRP \u00a359.99</p> <p>InnoTab 2, Vtech, RRP \u00a384.99</p> <p>Jake and the Neverland Pirates \u2013 Pirate Ship Bucky, Mattel, RRP \u00a349.99</p> <p>LeapPad 2, Leapfrog Toys, RRP \u00a389.99</p> <p>Lego Friends: Olivia's House, Lego, RRP \u00a369.99</p> <p>Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Mines of Moria, Lego, \u00a368.99</p> <p>Mike the Knight's Deluxe Glendragon Playset, Character Options, \u00a329.99</p> <p>Monster High Ghouls Rule Dolls, Mattel, RRP \u00a322.99</p> <p>My Moshi Home, Vivid Imaginations, RRP \u00a339.99</p> <p>Nerf N-Strike Elite Hail-Fire, Hasbro, RRP \u00a344.99</p> <p>Twister Dance, Hasbro, RRP \u00a326.99</p> <p>Web Shooting Spider-Man, Hasbro, RRP \u00a334.99</p>",
  "<p>In the build-up to Hurricane Sandy, New York City's Mayor Bloomberg and other city and state officials made valiant efforts to keep New Yorkers safe by ordering mandatory evacuations of hundreds of thousands of city residents and shutting down the mass transit system that serves over 5 million people daily. Similar precautions were taken for last year's Hurricane Irene, and although neither storm was expected to be remotely as severe as Hurricane Katrina, which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_Hurricane_Katrina_in_New_Orleans\">devastated</a> New Orleans and surrounding areas in 2005, government officials are clearly reluctant to repeat the mistakes of that episode.</p> <p>Unfortunately, however, the concern for our wellbeing does not appear to extend to the thousands of New Yorkers locked up in our city's jails.</p> <p>During a press conference over the weekend, when Bloomberg was asked about the fate of prisoners on the water-locked jail complex known as Rikers Island, his <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/29/bloombergs_scant_regard_for_prisoners_in_the_storm/\">response</a> to reporters was that they should not \"worry about anybody getting out\". It did not seem to occur to the mayor that the reporters and, indeed, the families of the prisoners, not to mention the prisoners themselves, might be more concerned about their chances of drowning than that someone might escape.</p> <p>The mayor insisted that \"Rikers Island, the land is up where they are and jails are secured\", which I take to mean that he believed the prison was not susceptible to flooding. This claim is a little hard to take at face value, however, as evacuation zone maps tellingly show that the areas immediately surrounding Rikers Island <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/28/nyregion/hurricane-evacuation-zones.html\">are all marked</a> as being at high to moderate risk of flooding, while the prison complex remains noncommittally grayed out in their midst.</p> <p>Last year, before Hurricane Irene struck, both the mayor and the New York City department of corrections (NYCDOC) <a href=\"http://solitarywatch.com/2011/08/26/locked-up-and-left-behind-new-yorks-prisoners-and-hurricane-irene/\">came under fire</a> when it became apparent that there was no plan in place to safely evacuate the 12,000 or so prisoners who would be truly trapped on Rikers Island if disaster struck. This year, the NYCDOC <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/doc/html/news/HurricaneSandy-Update2.pdf\">released a statement (pdf)</a> on its website insisting that the jail could withstand anything up to a category four hurricane and was not at risk from Sandy. It went on to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"NYCDOC staff and the inmate population is clearly our top priority and in the highly unlikely event that an evacuation would become necessary, it would occur.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>They did not elaborate as to how exactly this would occur, and requests for further information had not been answered at the time of writing.</p> <p>Prisoner advocates remain unconvinced that any viable evacuation plan exists. I spoke with Lisa Ortega of the New York City Jails Action Coalition, whose 16-year-old son lived through the terrifying ordeal of being a prisoner at Rikers during Hurricane Irene. Ortega had this to say about the alleged evacuation plan:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The only way on and off that island is by bridge. If that bridge becomes inaccessible due to flooding, do they have 12,000 lifejackets on hand? Do they have hundreds of life boats standing by? If there is a plan in place to remove the prisoners safely why can't they give us specifics.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ortega is right to be concerned as moving prisoners en masse is going to be a challenge at the best of times. Trying to do so from a waterlocked facility during a massive storm with limited staff on hand would be next to impossible. The general lack of concern and respect for prisoners, regardless of what they might have done to earn their status, also doesn't inspire confidence that their safety will be prioritized.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398629522\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351696843915/neworleansprison_220.jpg\" alt=\"New Orleans prisoners after Katrina\" width=\"220\" height=\"174\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prisoners from New Orleans Parish Prison, partially evacuated after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Even though the mayor of New Orleans had just ordered the city's first ever mandatory evacuation, the sheriff of Orleans Parish Prison (OPP) boldly declared that the approximately 6,500 prisoners would be staying \"where they belong\". An ACLU <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/aclu-report-details-horrors-suffered-orleans-parish-prisoners-wake-hurricane-katrina\">report</a> describes what happened to these prisoners after the storm hit:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"As floodwaters rose in the OPP buildings, power was lost, and entire buildings were plunged into darkness. Deputies left their posts wholesale, leaving behind prisoners in locked cells, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests. Prisoners went days without food, water and ventilation, and deputies admit that they received no emergency training and were entirely unaware of any evacuation plan. Even some prison guards were left locked in at their posts to fend for themselves, unable to provide assistance to prisoners in need.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Just like the prisoners at Rikers Island, many of those left \"where they belong\" in New Orleans had committed crimes as minor as failing to pay parking tickets or passing a forged check. It shouldn't matter, though, what a prisoner has done to earn his or her sentence: the state is constitutionally obliged to ensure that they do not come to harm.</p> <p>That's what makes the New York mayor's remarks that we should not \"worry about anybody getting out\" so off-color.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Many of the scariest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/30/hurricane-sandy-storm-new-york?newsfeed=true\">false rumours gripping New York during Hurricane Sandy</a> could be traced, it turned out, to a single Twitter user. As the water levels rose and the electricity cut out, the anonymous person behind the widely-followed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug\">@ComfortablySmug</a> account convinced thousands that worse was on the way: that the whole of Manhattan would lose power; that the subway would be shut for a week; that power company workers were trapped inside a building; and that the stock exchange was under 3ft of water, a misconception that Piers Morgan spread far further via CNN. And so, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/31/superstorm-sandy-cleanup-live\">the urgent business of removing downed trees and draining flooded tunnels began</a>, New York embarked on another vital task: ending the anonymity of the person who'd maliciously made everyone panic. It appeared to take <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jackstuef\">Jack Stuef at Buzzfeed</a> about six seconds to confirm that @ComfortablySmug was Shashank Tripathi, who conformed almost too perfectly to villainous stereotype by being both a Republican party operative and a hedge-fund manager. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/263466343360253952/photo/1\">Late on Tuesday, Tripathi posted: \"I wish to offer the people of New York a sincere, humble and unconditional apology. During a natural disaster that threatened the entire city, I made a series of irresponsible and inaccurate tweets.\"</a> No kidding. Tripathi was resigning, he said, from his job as campaign manager for New York Republican congressional candidate Christopher Wight, though his attempt at contrition didn't dissuade one city councilman, Peter Vallone, from saying <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/councilman-pushes-for-charges-against-twitter-user\">criminal charges should be considered.</a> \"I hope the fact that I'm asking for criminal charges to be seriously considered will make him much less comfortable and much less smug,\" Vallone was quoted as saying. There is a lesson here for all of us: if you're an heartless liar looking to make people's lives slightly worse, don't choose a Twitter user name that will embarrass you when it all goes wrong. (Maybe something like @HeartlessLiar would be more appropriate?)</p> <p>\u2022 Perhaps the most reassuring sign that America will emerge unbowed from Sandy's assault: the immediate eruption of partisan sniping, absurd conspiracy theories and accusations of media bias. \"Does anyone else find it deliciously ironic that Hurricane Sandy\u2026\" <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/332062/suspended-non-reanimation-michael-walsh\">begins Michael Walsh at the conservative bastion the National Review</a> \u2013 but, on second thoughts, let's leave that one there. \"The big federal government some say is needed to deal with big problems like Sandy went home early in DC yesterday and is mostly closed today,\" <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/30/amid-sandy-clean-up-fox-news-brit-hume-snipes-a/191003\">tweeted Fox News's Brit Hume</a>. (Where to begin?) Bernard Goldberg, the former CBS producer who now pens book-length attacks on the \"liberal media\", wondered live on air: \"Do you think that more than a few reporters are sort of wishing that the hurricane [had] hit Iowa and Ohio and Wisconsin?\u2026 Because that might help President Obama.\" Other hypotheses: <a href=\"http://www.wnd.com/2012/10/could-frankenstorm-be-a-sign-from-god/?cat_orig=us\">it's a message from God about Israel</a>; <a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/hurricane-sandy-divine-wind-for-obama/\">it's Obama using weather-manipulation to win the election</a>;<br><a href=\"http://www.edgeboston.com/news/religion/news/138474/conservative_christians_blame_the_gays_for_hurricane_sandy\">it's punishment for the \"homosexual agenda\"</a> (thanks, Pastor John McTernan, of Defend and Proclaim the Faith Ministries!); or <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/can-your-gun-be-confiscated-during-a-national-emergency/\">it's a plot to seize your guns</a>. Not climate change, though. I mean, come on \u2013 this is no time for conspiracy theories.</p> <p>\u2022 If some screenwriter out there has already begun work on a movie about the storm, he or she won't be able to include the comments of Michael Brown, the former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: audiences will deem them too implausible. Brown, you'll recall, was the man whom George Bush famously praised for doing a \"heckuva job\" in his mishandling of the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, yet in <a href=\"http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2012/10/michael_brown_fema_obama_hurricane_sandy.php\">an interview with a Denver paper</a>, conducted as Sandy bore down on the north east, he not only had the temerity to offer the current administration his advice \u2013 eyebrow-raising in itself \u2013 but suggested that Barack Obama was responding (can you guess?) too rapidly. \"One thing he's gonna be asked is, why did he jump on this so quickly and go back to DC so quickly, when in Benghazi, he went to Las Vegas? Why was this so quick? ...

He was quoted as saying the number of wind turbines in the UK \"seems extraordinary\", and \"we can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities\".</p> <p>A source said the minister had planned to make the remarks in a speech on Tuesday night but was instructed to remove them by Davey if he wanted to deliver a speech.</p> <p>The source said: \"What he planned to say was not government policy; will not be government policy. It might be what the Tory party would like to be energy policy, but it is not. He is not in charge of renewable policies on his own: he has to follow the coalition agreement, which is in favour of renewable energy and meeting our legal EU targets for 2020.</p> <p>\"He has been very silly to give interviews to the Telegraph and the Mail on a speech he was not allowed to deliver.</p> <p>\"The only way we are going to meet our targets is if we include renewable energy which is ultimately a cheap form of energy, and in parts of Wales and Scotland is popular.\"</p> <p>Decc concedes that if the number of onshore windfarms already built, those under construction, and those in the pipeline seeking construction are built, the UK will probably have enough onshore farms to meet its renewable targets. But the source said it was entirely wrong to say at this stage that no more windfarms will be built.</p> <p>Davey has taken control of renewable strategy from Hayes, and left the Tory minister with responsibility for delivery.</p> <p>Hayes was returning this morning from Scotland to hold discussions with Davey amid signs that a frank discussion is going to be necessary to smooth over relations and construct an alliance around the forthcoming energy bill.</p> <p>In the newspaper interviews, Hayes said: \"I can't single-handedly build a new Jerusalem but I can protect our green and pleasant land.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"If you look at what has been built, what has consent and what is in the planning system, much of it will not get through and will be rejected. Even if a minority of what's in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 [renewable energy] target \u2026 I'm saying enough is enough.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2012/oct/31/david-cameron-policy-renewable-energy-video\">David Cameron tried to draw a line under the dispute</a> at prime minister's questions in the Commons, insisting there had been no change in government policy.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said there were enough wind farms in existence or in the pipeline for the government to meet its EU imposed targets on renewable energy, and stressed that the current subsidies can be changed in the future.</p> <p>In an official statement, Davey said: \"There has been no change to government policy on renewable energy, as collectively agreed by the coalition cabinet. We set out in the renewable energy roadmap in July 2011 how we expect to reach our target of getting 30% of all UK electricity from renewable sources by 2020.</p> <p>\"We've put in place support to bring on growth in new industries to deploy the technologies needed to diversify our energy mix in the most cost-effective way. There are no targets \u2013 or caps \u2013 for individual renewable technologies such as onshore wind. Nor are there reviews being done of onshore wind on the basis of landscape or property values.</p> <p>\"What we're currently consulting on are ways of making sure local communities feel the benefit of hosting windfarms, and whether our understanding of future costs is accurate.</p> <p>\"Onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables, which is why we've been able to cut the subsidy. It has an important role to play in our energy future.\"</p> <p>Caroline Flint, Davey's Labour shadow, has said the Tory-Lib Dem row over windfarms shows that the UK has \"a shambles of a Tory-led government which can't even agree with itself\".</p> <p>Flint said: \"Onshore wind is the most developed and cheapest source of clean energy. If the government tries robbing Peter to pay Paul and cuts support for wind power, it could leave the public with even higher bills.\"</p> <p>The row came as the renewable energy industry met in Glasgow for <a href=\"http://www.renewable-uk.com/events/annual-conference/\" title=\"\">its annual conference</a>.</p> <p>Trade body RenewableUK's deputy chief executive, Maf Smith, said: \"As the wind industry meets in Glasgow to celebrate the success of this industry, it comes as some surprise that the new minister has said one thing to us and another to the press. We are on the eve of the publication of the energy bill, a crucial time for energy policy, with huge investment decisions to be made that will lead to tens of thousands of jobs over the next decade. If we are to see these jobs and investment realised confidence must be retained and that means consistency.\"</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs\" title=\"\">Davey said</a> the Tory \"Tea Party\" tendency was threatening green investment in the UK, and a group of global wind and nuclear companies <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3561457.ece\" title=\"\">warned earlier this month</a> that political uncertainty was threatening millions in investment.</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/30/energy-strategy-renewables\" title=\"\">Hayes said</a> \"our long-term goal is to enable renewables to compete against other forms of low-carbon generation without subsidy\" but in the same comment piece praised the renewable energy sector for creating 20,000 jobs over the last year. The number of onshore windfarms built over the past year <a href=\"http://www.renewableuk.com/en/publications/index.cfm/SOI2012\" title=\"\">will be worth \u00a3737m to the economy over their lifetime</a>, according to RenewableUK.</p> <p>The Tories and Lib Dems have had a series of run-ins over wind power this year, starting with <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9061997/101-Tories-revolt-over-wind-farms.html\" title=\"\">a letter by 101 Tory MPs</a> demanding an end to onshore wind subsidies and culminating in a fight in the summer over the level of subsidy cuts, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/24/victory-libdems-onshore-wind-subsidies\" title=\"\">which Davey eventually won</a> by securing a 10% cut rather than the 25% that Chancellor George Osborne had wanted.</p> <p>Responding to Hayes's attack on windfarms, Greenpeace energy campaigner Leila Deen said: \"John Hayes's petulant outburst adds to the coalition's growing energy shambles and to a deepening divide within government between those who care about green growth and the economy and those who just want more oil and gas.</p> <p>\"Here is a new minister veering off-brief and publicly contradicting his bosses. His comments threaten jobs and his approach will drive up energy bills.</p> <p>\"Cameron needs to take charge, decide whose side he's on and reassure industry and investors that John Hayes won't go over their heads and make policy over the phone to the Daily Mail.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord (Michael) Heseltine has a special place in the heart of the <em>Northerner</em>; indeed he's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/mar/13/michael-heseltine-liverpool-freeman-margaret-thatcher\">practically our patron saint</a>.</p> <p>How good, therefore to see him <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/heseltine-report-blasts-coalition-growth\">making headlines with another call for action </a>on genuine regional devolution, of the sort which made his influence so important to the north in Margaret Thatcher's years.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/heseltine-review\">review of competitiveness, <em>No Stone Unturned</em></a>, laments the abolition of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10391326\">regional development agencies </a>and calls for their successors such as the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/143855.pdf\">City Regions</a> and the 39 <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/leps\">Local Enterprise Partnerships</a> to be beefed up, not just with money (though that is fundamental) but with powers and responsibility as well. You can read Michael White's largely approving <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/oct/31/michael-heseltine-plan-h\">take on the suggestions here</a>, and a more sceptical analysis from Karel Williams of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/lord-heseltine-britain-ex-industrial-regions\">Manchester Business School here.</a> Williams makes good cautionary points, but Heseltine is surely a vast improvement on everything else around which has some chance of acceptance by the current government.</p> <p>Here's some regional reaction to be going on with, universally approving. James Ramsbotham chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.necc.co.uk/\">North East Chambers of Commerce</a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord Heseltine is spot-on to say the UK needs to have a relentless focus on competitiveness, and is spot on to say that real competitiveness requires all parts of the country to fulfill their potential.<br>&#xa0;<br>We firmly believe the North East economy is a huge asset that could and should be developed further. That requires national policies that take better account of regional differences, and more local control of our own destiny.<br>&#xa0;<br>It would be a huge missed opportunity if the response to this important report is to get mired in a lengthy debate over reorganising institutions. We need in the region to quickly get on with tackling the issues of infrastructure development, better procurement, swifter planning and growing exports which Lord Heseltine rightly identifies.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Liberal Democrats failed to ride to the rescue of the RDAs; and it is no doubt true that regionalism does not set the electorate alight, athough it should. But here's <a href=\"http://timfarron.co.uk/\">Tim Farron</a> applauding unstintingly from his Cumbrian constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The report produced by Lord Heseltine advocates what many of us locally have been calling on for years. There is no one in Whitehall who will be able to understand how money to help the local economy should be spent in Cumbria, better than Cumbrians<br>&#xa0;<br>Many people have claimed that this is a critical report of the economic plan the Government has put together so far. However I see this as an opportunity to extend the work already being done to hand more power back to local people, local authorities and local bodies. Ensuring the <a href=\"http://www.cumbrialep.co.uk/\">Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership</a> has more power to decide how money should be spent in our local area would be a much needed step forward for our county.</p> </blockquote> <p>And finally, for now, the chair of<a href=\"http://www.leedscityregion.gov.uk/lcr-lep/\"> Leeds City region's LEP</a>, Neil McLean says this: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord Heseltine's report is includes some bold, transformative proposals that would be a step-change in enabling places like Leeds City Region to take charge of their own economic destiny. The devolution of real powers and significant, flexible budgets to LEPs would cement the progress we have made with our City Deal, with future investment in all areas key to growth driven by local decisions and following local priorities.</p> <p>In the Leeds City Region we would also be confident in facing Lord Heseltine's radical proposal of a competition between LEPs for this devolved funding. Whether or not Government embraces that, I urge them to respond positively to the thrust of his recommendations to give LEPs extra flexibility and firepower to deliver on our ambitions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What do you think? And can we help make it happen?</strong></p>",
  "<p>There are 4.5m small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the UK, making up 99% of all organisations and employing an estimated 13.8 million people \u2013 almost 60% of the private sector workforce. SMEs also generate a combined annual turnover of \u00a31,500bn, almost half of that created by all businesses in the UK.</p> <p>But despite their positive contribution to the UK's economy SMEs are proving slow to adopt sustainability programmes that could be the answer to them staying in business. And it isn't due to a lack of initiatives, including free consultations offered by local Business Improvement Districts to <a href=\"http://www.bitc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Business in the Community</a> and others.</p> <p>In fact, many SMEs admit to confusion over what sustainability is and which programme to follow. Add some typically poor communications coming from the sustainability sector and you have a recipe for inertia. Unless they are specifically instructed, SME chief executives are going to be slow to allocate precious resources to a sustainability initiative that they do not understand.</p> <p>Put simply, sustainability has got to be made easy. While there may be buy-in from most departments, there is often concern about who is responsible for the programme and how much time it will take. SME heads need to know how a sustainability programme is going to deliver operational efficiencies, open the door to new business, cost much less money than it generates (or even zero cost), and how the whole programme will be managed by enthusiastic employees.</p> <p><strong>The 7 Days to Sustainability campaign</strong></p> <p>We officially launched the 7 Days to Sustainabilty campaign this week to address this problem and more than 350 organisations have already participated in a successful four-month trial period.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.7days2sustainability.com/register\" title=\"\">Free to join for all UK businesses</a>, the campaign is designed to make sustainability easy to implement while delivering business benefits in terms of cost savings, marketing and employee engagement.</p> <p>Once registered, each business receives a campaign poster and seven daily emails containing practical sustainability advice. The emails cover key topics such as energy efficiency, waste and recycling, travel, food, water, health and wellbeing. There is also advice on how businesses can communicate the success of their sustainability programme.</p> <p>The campaign has received some fantastic support from individuals such as sustainability guru Jonathon Porritt, and Greg Barker, minister of state for climate change, and Deborah Meaden, from BBC's Dragons Den. Some of Britain's largest companies including M&amp;S, Tesco, Land Securities, Deloitte, Salesforce.com, VolkerWessels UK, Waste Matters, ProcServe and Prologis are also proudly working together as corporate partners to support the campaign by spreading the message to their suppliers and other SMEs.</p> <p>The campaign provides a useful first step to sustainability, but businesses can build on this further by making continuous improvements in their environmental performance.</p> <p>Independent Ccertification can provide the proof a business needs to talk about its sustainability credentials to customers and other stakeholders with confidence. It's and it's this transparency that inspires trust in certification schemes, as there's no chance of \"greenwash\" if an independent expert has put their stamp on it. This stamp, often achieved through certification, can also help businesses stand apart from competitors in an increasingly competitive market.</p> <p>We have found many certified businesses already saving \u00a3125-\u00a3150 per employee per annum and there are significant new business and brand benefits to be gained from a programme that is being delivered by your own employees, with input and assessment from an experienced third party.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.thoughtcrew.net/\" title=\"\">Thoughtcrew</a> reduced their travel expenditure by 80% after switching to webinars instead of non-essential travel. Dr Phil Richardson, chief executive, said meetings with Pepsi, HP and Unilever, which used to require up to four hours worth of travel now take just 45 minutes of company time through meeting online.</p> <p>With rising energy prices and upcoming legislation such as mandatory carbon reporting, there are an increasing number of reasons why businesses are adopting sustainable certification, including being able to show those credentials to customers. And by making sustainability easy to adopt, the final barrier of resource should no longer be an issue.</p> <p><em>Steve Malkin is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.beplanetpositive.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Planet Positive</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>This week's final edition of The Thick Of It contained what may be the last innocent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim%27ll_Fix_It\" title=\"\">Jim'll Fix It</a> joke in TV fiction, when Chris Addison's Ollie Reeder fantasised about sending a letter to the show to solve a Labour party crisis. Stand by now for a deluge of deliberate and hostile Savile references in comedy and drama.</p> <p>But, having already become the first TV star to make more impact on the schedules dead than alive, Jimmy Savile made his most curious posthumous contribution so far in this week's final episode of the ninth series of BBC1's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t0qx\" title=\"\">New Tricks</a>.</p> <p>This story \u2013 titled Glasgow UCOS and written by the show's creator, Roy Mitchell \u2013 had already been postponed from the previous Monday because it involved allegations of a paedophile ring operating in children's care homes, a plot-line judged too sensitive by the BBC before Hurricane Sandy caused a relative drop in the levels of the Savile tidal wave.</p> <p>However, when the show was finally screened, it proved to have a rather startling relationship with the former star of the channel on which it was being transmitted.</p> <p>Two members of the cold case review squad \u2013 Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman) and Steve McAndrew (Denis Lawson) \u2013 drove to Glasgow to serve as consultants on a new re-investigations unit being set up there.</p> <p>The first of the unsolved homicides involved James Soutar, a wealthy \"lifelong bachelor\" who had been pursued since his death by rumours of a \"secret dark other life\".</p> <p>Although Soutar's will had left \"three million quid that mainly went to children's charities\", there were allegations that he had been involved in a sex ring \u2013 also involving senior police officers and politicians \u2013 that procured underage girls from care homes.</p> <p>Now any similarities may be no more than a spooky coincidence, however the alleged paedophile invented by Roy Mitchell not only has the same initials as Savile but an identical first name (although the script notes that intimates called him \"Jimmy\") and a matching number of letters in the surname? It's true that James Soutar was a Glaswegian bookmaker, but Savile had a Scottish connection \u2013 keeping a Highland holiday home that was recently searched by police \u2013 and was the son of a bookie. Soutar's final bequest to children's charities was also close to the amount that Savile left to his own charitable foundations. The implications of involvement with senior establishment figures are also, as we now know, a factor in the Savile case.</p> <p>It's common for fiction writers to get round issues of legality or taste by creating a composite figure with nudgingly familiar details. While Savile was still alive, the crime-writer Val McDermid featured a character called Jacko Vance (Savile's middle-name was Vince) in the Wire in the Blood books. Played in the TV adaptations by John Michie, Vance is a much-loved Northern TV celebrity who hid a predilection for raping and torturing young women.</p> <p>Watching the New Tricks episode, my view was that this police series may have done something similar. Although Savile would have been beyond the protection of libel law at the time the storyline was written and filmed, the allegations of collusion involving the legal establishment and children's homes potentially involved living figures and so would have required subterfuge.</p> <p>Late in the episode, though, something striking happened that can only be discussed by spoiling the plot and so anyone intending to catch up on iPlayer or DVD box-set should look away now.</p> <p>After Standing and McAndrew had been frustrated by the difficulty of investigating a case in which the assumed criminal is dead \u2013 another prescient resonance with the Savile affair \u2013 the reveal in the final moments was that James Soutar had been falsely demonised. The Glaswegian bookie was a saint and philanthropist who intervened to protect young girls from the appetites of their powerful friends, giving the victims money to escape and start new lives elsewhere.</p> <p>So, weirdly, having been pulled from the schedules because it might have seemed too close to the circumstances of the current controversy, the episode now felt too far removed. New Tricks now seemed to be serving as some inadvertent piece of BBC balance, alerting viewers to the possibility that there might be an innocent explanation for what happened and that Savile may have been operating as an undercover anti-paedophile agent.</p> <p>In fact, the explanation may be that the edition was a covert dramatisation of aspects of the Savile allegations but that the demands of peak-time crime drama \u2013 which requires several twists before the end \u2013 dictated the improbable denouement. While, viewers can go into an episode of Panorama with a rough idea of what happened and come out convinced that it did, a peak-time drama audience wants to have its suspicions subverted.</p> <p>The episode remains, though, an intriguing footnote to the Savile business. Oddly, New Tricks is part of a Monday-night schedule that also prominently includes Panorama. The disgraced star of Saturday nights now haunts a different part of peak-time.</p>",
  "<p>Human rights campaigners have called for a full criminal investigation into the rendition of a Pakistani man by UK and US forces to Afghanistan, following a <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2012_0033_Judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">supreme court judgment</a> describing his subsequent detention at the notorious US prison at Bagram as unlawful. Yunus Rahmatullah has been imprisoned ever since he was handed over by the SAS to American forces in Iraq in 2004, and has never been charged.</p> <p>Lawyers for the man <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/03/bagram-yunus-rahmatullah-supreme-court\" title=\"\">argued before the UK's highest court</a> that the government should apply pressure on the US to release him. The court of appeal had previously issued a writ of habeas corpus \u2013 an ancient law that demands a prisoner is released from unlawful detention \u2013 requiring the UK to seek Rahmatullah's return or at least demonstrate why it could not. However, the US authorities refused to cooperate, arguing that they would discuss Rahmatullah's situation with the Pakistani government.</p> <p>Lawyers for William Hague and Philip Hammond, the foreign and defence secretaries, had argued that they had no power \"to direct the US\" to release him and that it would be inappropriate for the courts to instruct them to ask the US authorities to return Rahmatullah.</p> <p>Rejecting this argument, a panel of seven supreme court judges ruled that the UK did not need to have actual custody to exercise control over his release. The UK's most senior judges also declared that there was clear evidence that Rahmatullah's rendition and detention was a breach of international human rights law, despite \"memorandums of understanding\" Britain had agreed with the US over treatment of detainees.</p> <p>Lord Kerr said: \"The, presumably forcible, transfer of Mr Rahmatullah from Iraq to Afghanistan is, at least prima facie, a breach of article 49 [of the fourth Geneva Convention]. On that account alone, his continued detention post-transfer is unlawful.\"</p> <p>Kerr also said that he would have \"little hesitation in dismissing\" arguments from former US assistant attorney general Jack Goldsmith asserting that al-Qaida operatives found in occupied Iraq were excluded from protection under the Geneva Conventions during armed conflict.</p> <p>However, the court was split 5-2 in a decision to reject arguments by Rahmatullah's lawyers that there was more that the UK government could do following the American's refusal to respond to the habeas corpus writ. Rahmatullah was represented by legal charity Reprieve and solicitors Leigh Day, who argued that the UK should have made more effort to demand his release.</p> <p>In a dissenting judgment, Lady Hale and Lord Carnwath said: \"Where liberty is at stake, it is not the court's job to speculate as to the political sensitivities which may be in play.\"</p> <p>Reprieve's director, Clive Stafford Smith, said: \"This powerful supreme court decision has huge ramifications. Clearly there will now have to be a full criminal investigation. But if the US has 'dishonoured' its commitment to the UK in this case for the first time in 150 years, and continues to violate law as basic as the Geneva conventions, this also throws other extradition agreements with the UK into doubt.\"</p> <p>Reprieve's legal director, Kat Craig, added: \"The UK government has nowhere left to turn. The highest court in the country has expressed serious concerns that grave war crimes may have been committed as a result of which a police investigation must be initiated without delay.\"</p> <p>Yunus Rahmatullah and Amanatullah Ali, both Pakistani men, are suspected of having travelled to Iraq to fight for al-Qaida. MI6 is understood to have tracked them as they travelled across Iran and into Iraq early in 2004. After they settled into a house in southern Baghdad a decision was taken to raid the building.</p> <p>In an operation codenamed Op Aston, SAS troopers attacked the house, shooting dead two men and capturing several others. After the detainees were handed over to the US military, Rahmatullah and Ali were held at a prison at Baghdad international airport, according to a British military source. They were then flown to Afghanistan and taken to the US-run prison at Bagram, north of Kabul, a transfer that was in breach of the Geneva conventions.</p> <p>SAS troopers detaining suspected militants in central Iraq were usually accompanied by one US special forces soldier, and the prisoners were then deemed to be the legal responsibility of the US government. For reasons that are currently unclear, no US forces accompanied the SAS on the Op Aston raid.</p> <p>The aircraft that took the two men to Afghanistan is thought to have been the Boeing 737 that had a few days earlier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/special-report-britain-rendition-libya\" title=\"\">carried Abdel Hakim Belhaj</a> and his pregnant wife Fatima Bouchar to Tripoli, in a so-called rendition operation mounted by MI6 and Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence agencies. This operation is now the subject of a Scotland Yard inquiry.</p>",

We were regularly nudging our overdraft limit and had some difficult debts from clients. How could we turn things around?</p> <p>It's been tough for everyone in the recession, but addressing these problems meant looking close to home. A new cashflow system actually meant a whole new business model. We made three radical changes:</p> <p>1.We need to be as close to the money as possible. In the past we had a fragmented client base with lots of small value contracts, often subcontracts. We were chasing multiple payments and found it hard to predict our income. We took a risk and changed our set of clients to focus on direct relationships. </p> <p>2. We put an end to the unpredictability of being a small business, introducing a new system to project our cashflow. Using the Salesforce cloud computing platform we can now accurately predict cashflow up to 12 months in advance. With this information we can confidently make new investments.</p> <p>3. We went through and cherry-picked our clients, using a credit check expert. Slashing over 50% of clients meant a loss of just 20% turnover \u2013 it was well worth it. We switched to termed contracts too, only investing stock and admin time in projects guaranteed to run to completion.</p> <p>With these simple but fundamental changes we have moved into profit and continue to win new contracts. Without these changes our business might not have survived.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Justin Halfpenny is the director of <a href=\"http://www.primaservice.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prima Service</a> <br></em></p> <p><strong>Find out how you can enter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/best-practice-exchange\">our Best Practice exchange here</a>.

That was the platform for a brief take on how fantastically Americans respond to adversity. But he said nothing about the government's relief response nor did he touch on the questions dogging him about a statement he made last year saying he would scrap the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) which has led the post-Sandy recovery efforts and drawn praise from New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie.</p> <p>But former Florida governor Jeb Bush did weigh in at the Romney rally. He said his thoughts and prayers are with those enduring Sandy's destruction but then, in what sounded a little like one upmanship, he reminded the crowd that in 2004-5 Florida was hit by eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. And that, from his experience, \"local level and state level\" is better at handling the response than Fema. The crowd liked that, a lot.</p> <p>Romney played to his crowd in part of the country where Hispanic voters could decide the issue with a promise to boost trade with Latin America, saying it's economy is a big as China's and that it doesn't cheat as much.</p> <p>And Florida's role in the space programme prompted a familiar, lengthy story about Romney, the Boy Scouts and a flag on the space shuttle Challenger when it blew up. The flag survived. The crowd aah-ed. Romney managed not to mention that the space programme is government funded. It was among the more effective parts of a speech that was long on railing against corporate tax rates and working with Democrats as governor of Massachusetts to cut spending</p> </blockquote> <p>Nice to hear <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> criticise the federal government when under the aegis of his brother George, which it would have been in 2004-05.

Romney hasn't been helped by the Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie's praise for Obama and FEMA during the crisis.</p> <p>Still, Romney has good reason to get back to campaigning, particularly in Florida where his substantial bounce after Obama's disastrous first debate performance has evaporated. Polls put the Republican candidate up to seven percentage points ahead a month ago but a New York Times survey on Wednesday has the president back in front, even if only by one point.</p> <p>If Romney doesn't take Florida, there's little chance of him winning the election.&#xa0;Outside the first stop at a Tampa aircraft hangar, a Romney opponent taunted supporters arriving for the rally by marking Halloween dressed up as a Republican Grim Reaper ready to slay Obamacare. The crowd mostly ignored the cries of \"Happy Halloween\" and deathly cackle.</p> </blockquote> <p>Interesting that former governor Bush is appearing with Romney today \u2013 and not current Republican governor <strong>Rick Scott</strong>.

They could be those who have 'ignored' bodily death like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire\">vampires </a>or <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/\">mummies</a>, those who have died but their bodies have been reanimated like <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-scientific-reasons-zombie-apocalypse-could-actually-happen.html\">zombies</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein's_monster\">Frankenstein's monster</a>, or those like <a href=\"http://www.ghosts.org.uk/\">ghosts</a> who have lost their body altogether but seem to be unaware of this fact.</p> <p>But Halloween is a bit of harmless fun for one night of the year. For the rest of the time, if you want to posthumously do something with your body, there's always science.</p> <p>Donating your body to science is a concept most people are familiar with but few know how to go about. In fairness, those who do end up leaving their body to science don't talk about it afterwards, so the process isn't something that's become common knowledge. It's not a matter of having your carcass dropped off at the nearest laboratory; there are a lot of legal matters to attend to. But even if there weren't, there's not much a typical lab can actually do with a human body, not unless they urgently need a cumbersome and extremely morbid paperweight.</p> <p>Donating your body to science is actually a complex and tightly regulated process. However, it's possible, to some extent, to actually let science use your body without being dead. What follows is a step-by-step guide on the several levels of using your body for the good of science, depending on how keen you are.</p> <p>(For the record, I'm classing \"medicine\" and other therapeutic practices as sciences, because they are.)</p> <p><strong>Level 1: Short term body hire.</strong></p> <p>It is possible to let science use your body for research a short period, while you are still in it. Many scientific experiments require human volunteers. Just seek out your nearest university with a <a href=\"http://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-experiments.html\">psychology department</a>. Much of psychology requires the <a href=\"http://www8.open.ac.uk/platform/news-and-features/volunteer-in-psychology-research\">study</a> of normal, healthy people, so you typically just need to be physically present and perform some basic task. These experiments are generally safe and relatively easy. That's not to say a purely psychological experiment can't cause some <a href=\"http://www.prisonexp.org/\">serious harm to participants</a>, but (in the UK at least) every experiment involving human participants must obtain <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/forms-policies-and-checklists/ethics-approval-research\">ethical approval</a>.</p> <p>If you fancy putting your body through something a bit more \"hi-tech\", then head for your nearest <a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ion/involved/volunteer/\">neurology or neuroscience department</a>. I myself have volunteered for a battery of tests in the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (<a href=\"http://psych.cf.ac.uk/cubric/\">CUBRIC</a>). I've had parts of my brain shut down by <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/07/15/brain-stimulation-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation\">TMS</a> (temporarily, they assure me) and spent so long in <a href=\"http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=fmribrain\">fMRI scanners </a>that I was eventually trying to think specific thoughts that would cause my brain activity to spell out rude words in my cortex, to amuse the experimenters. That's got to be the most cerebral form of graffiti ever.</p> <p>There are undoubtedly other experiment formats to volunteer for. So Level 1 is a good way to help science by using your body, without losing any of it aside from the<a href=\"http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/information/anatomy/shed-skin-cells.htm\"> usual skin flakes and hair,</a> which you'd lose wherever you were. For the record, any scientist who collects and uses these after you've left is unlikely to be doing so for any \"official\" research.</p> <p><strong>Level 2: Mid to long-term body hire</strong></p> <p>There are also more invasive experiments where you still don't technically lose any part of your body, but your body is likely to be used more \"intensively\". I'm referring to<a href=\"http://www.walesclinicaltrials.co.uk/\"> drug trials </a>and the like. Whether by <a href=\"http://www.trials4us.co.uk/contact/mayday.php\">hospitals</a> or <a href=\"http://volunteers.gsk.co.uk/default.aspx\">pharmaceutical companies</a>, drugs need to be tested before they're released onto the market, and you can let them use your body to do this. This usually has the benefit of financial remuneration, but the downside of potentially more negative side effects should things go wrong. You are essentially letting them put an experimental compound in your body, so there are likely to be metabolic or physiological consequences, which can be <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4807042.stm\">potentially quite damaging.</a> </p> <p>On the rare occasions when a drug trial does go wrong and makes the news, people do get quite put off, understandably. Last time it happened I did hear someone say \"they shouldn't test these drugs until they can be absolutely sure they're safe!\" As a statement, this misses the point so forcefully it ruptures the barriers of space-time and enters a parallel dimension where the original point doesn't even exist. But if you're willing to accept the risks (which are actually rather minor) then there are plenty of places <a href=\"http://www.trials4us.co.uk/index.php\">to sign up for trials.</a></p> <p>So Level 2 carries a greater financial reward, but requires a greater investment in science. You still get to keep all your body, but it may be changed in some way. </p> <p><strong>Level 3: Partial donation (temporary)<br></strong><br>You may be willing to actually surrender some of your physical mass for the good of science. Good on you. Luckily, there are ways to donate bits of you to science that regenerate after a sufficient interval.</p> <p>The most obvious and noble thing to do is <a href=\"http://www.blood.co.uk/\">donate blood</a>. Everyone should do this as a matter of course. I myself was hesitant about it for years, then I saw my wife give birth and my licence to be squeamish about anything was revoked forever. But giving blood is a ridiculously innocuous experience; please do it. It may not be scientific in the research sense, but as most body donation goes to research into saving lives, so it's just cutting out the middleman. And it doesn't hurt, at all. Plus, you get biscuits, and you feel like you deserve them for once.</p> <p>You do get to see some decent science while you donate. Data collection is important, as they need your<a href=\"http://www.blood.co.uk/can-i-give-blood/who-can-give-blood/\"> medical history and suitability</a>. They also need to check your blood iron levels. I expected some high tech scanning device, but they used the <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/how_4845244_donor-hemoglobin-using-copper-sulfate.html\">copper sulphate test</a>, a brilliantly elegant and simple test where they put a drop of your blood into a tube of copper sulphate and see how long it takes to sink. The more iron, the faster it sinks. I'm proud to say you could almost hear the 'clank' as my sample hit the bottom. I have very good iron levels, but then I am partial to the occasional raw steak, cabbage and rusty nail sandwich.</p> <p>You can<a href=\"http://www.hta.gov.uk/bodyorganandtissuedonation/howtodonateyourtissueforresearch.cfm\"> donate bodily tissues to science</a> in other ways too, if you so wish. But the blood donating thing is important, do that first if you want to go for level 3.</p> <p><strong>Level 4: Partial donation (Permanent)</strong></p> <p>It is an option to donate one or many of your organs to science. Typically, this has to be done posthumously. You can do it while still alive of course, with one of your \"spare\" organs, but this is almost exclusively for use in <a href=\"http://www.hta.gov.uk/bodyorganandtissuedonation/organdonations.cfm\">transplants</a>. If you wish to donate your organs posthumously for transplant, then you can do so simply by <a href=\"http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/\">joining the organ donor database.</a> There is still the debate as to whether organ donation should be<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jul/27/nhs-organ-donor-optout-transplants\"> opt-in or opt-out</a>. It's sad that it's even an issue, but I can appreciate that many don't like confronting mortality. If you asked random people in the street to sign a form that said \"I am going to die\", I'd bet many would refuse, for all that it's an indisputable fact and will have no effect on their lives.</p> <p>Should you wish to donate your organs to science, there are ways of doing this, particularly if you want to leave your brain to research. There are many <a href=\"http://www.hta.gov.uk/bodyorganandtissuedonation/howtodonateyourbody/donatingyourbrain.cfm\">people to contact if you wish to do this</a>. I will stress, based on conversations I've had, that you shouldn't try leaving your brain to the charities dedicated to fighting Alzheimer's, Parkinson's etc. Charities are usually dedicated to funding research into the condition and raising awareness, they don't actually have any use for the organs they focus on. Cancer research charities don't actually want people's tumours, and it's the same logic here. Please see the appropriate organisations in the link above should you opt for level 4 body donation.</p> <p><strong>Level 5: Body donation</strong></p> <p>You may still be dedicated to your entire form being used for scientific research and teaching. Most bodies donated will be used for the<a href=\"http://www.hta.gov.uk/bodyorganandtissuedonation/howtodonateyourbody.cfm\"> teaching and perfecting of medical knowledge and techniques</a>. I can speak about this with good authority as, after my undergraduate degree, I spent 18 months embalming donated cadavers for a medical school (and yet I was still squeamish about blood donation? Go figure). It's a very stringent system for donating your body for medical teaching. After all, deceased human tissue is potentially very dangerous in terms of biological hazards such as bacteria or other pathogens, and its use is strictly regulated by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/30/contents\">Human Tissue Act</a>. If your remains are going to be dissected and studied by numerous young medical students or trainees, their safety is paramount. Ergo, you can't donate your body if you succumbed to some communicable illness, or anything that doesn't have a known cause but which may be communicable, which means most terminal brain disorders exclude you from donating your body (both because of possible risk and because donation requires the informed and rational consent of the individual, and a neurological disorder confuses this issue). </p> <p>For the sake of medical teaching, a human body also has to be as intact and \"normal\" as possible, to reflect the majority of people a typical medic will encounter, so any particularly disfiguring illnesses (internally or externally) may also rule you out of donating. In a way, to successfully donate your body, you have to be in perfect health. But dead. You can see why it doesn't happen very often.</p> <p>So that's a brief rundown on the options for donating yourself to science. A more detailed and better written guide can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.hta.gov.uk/\">Human Tissue Authority website</a>, which I've linked to throughout. Or if you want to participate in experiments directly, you should now have enough info to at least make a start.</p> <p>Many people opt to give themselves to science, but you can even do this literally, if you so choose.</p> <p>And if you think this piece is a bit too serious for a Halloween blog, here is a video I did which provides a<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3juFYzXYLc&amp;feature=g-upl\"> Neuroscientific guide to surviving a zombie apocalypse</a> (I get bored easily).</p> <p><em>You can avoid Dean Burnett's body entirely by following him on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange</a> held a one day conference in Birmingham for Police &amp; Crime Commissioner candidates. The aim was to delve into some of the very real challenges that Commissioners will have to deal with from day one: the media, the public, concerns over outsourcing and what they need to do in the first weeks and months in office.</p> <p>The conclusion was, I think, overwhelming. Commissioners will have their work cut out for them. Some will inherit forces with strong management and a keen sense for fighting crime, others won't be so lucky.</p> <p>Those without a determined private office will find their diaries jammed with meetings: interest groups, local authorities, partner agencies, businesses, staff associations, members of the public and perhaps even a thinktank or two.</p> <p>They will be expected - if not required - to get to grips with managing the budget for a large organisation, while also mastering at least a basic knowledge of policing and the criminal justice system that lies beyond.</p> <p>In spite of all these challenges almost 200 candidates are standing in the 41 police areas affected. Many are independents - some with policing experience, others just with an interest in the issues. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/23/police-and-crime-commissioners-police\">See the list of north of England candidates here.</a></p> <p>There is no doubt that a good commissioner, with a good team, and a good chief, will have the potential to make a real difference to the lives of the public: particularly those who find themselves disproportionately affected by crime, or the fear of crime. Often this is the poorest, youngest and oldest in our society.</p> <p>It is reasonable to expect debates on police governance to rumble on, but Commissioners - whatever the turnout on 15 November - are here to stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398621822\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2011/9/2/1314980610512/Manchester-riots-002.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester riots\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street violence in Manchester last year.

Commissioners can also be expected to welcome, celebrate and support those policing activities the public hold most dear and want more of: notably, community policing.</p> <p>It helps that foot patrol and preventative approaches have been shown to both cut crime and improve satisfaction, especially among those groups with a history of dissatisfaction or poor service. The challenge will be developing a sustainable approach to providing this.</p> <p>The absence of a taxpayer-funded mailshot for candidates, the late arrival of the official Home Office website, the decision to hold the election on a cold dark night in November and a media hungry for tales of woe, might all contribute to the idea of a failing policy. As might the failure of some candidates to even claim their profile on our own <a href=\"http://www.PoliceElections.com\">PoliceElections.com website</a>.</p> <p>However the real test will be in three and a half years time, when the public get to vote again, on a brighter day in May, for a role they better understand - and, crucially, when they can see what has or hasn't changed.</p> <p>The brightest and best Commissioners will, like the rest, face challenges - but the opportunity to make a real difference, to real people, living real lives is unprecedented. Furthermore, is there any more crucial or noble pursuit than the maintenance of law, order and public safety?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398621823\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351688658835/ror.jpg\" alt=\"policy exchange\" width=\"130\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Rory Geoghegan </strong>is Crime &amp; Justice Research Fellow at the think tank <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange.</a> </em></p> <p><strong>The full line-up of candidates for the 12 PCCs in the north is on a <em>Northerner</em> post <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/23/police-and-crime-commissioners-police\">which you can read here</a>.

  "<p>Cambridge University Press and developer Agant have teamed up to launch two iPad apps providing an interactive spin on two of Shakespeare's most famous plays: Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet.</p> <p>Both apps \u2013 <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/romeo-juliet-explore-shakespeare/id562203479?mt=8\">Romeo and Juliet: Explore Shakespeare</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/macbeth-explore-shakespeare/id562189027?mt=8\">Macbeth: Explore Shakespeare</a> \u2013 include the full texts of the plays, along with audio performances, photographs of professional productions, glossary definitions, plot summaries, notes and articles by experts.</p> <p>They also offer interactive word clouds for individual scenes and characters, diagrams (or \"circles\") showing the relationships between characters in any given scene, and \"themelines\" to show how key themes wind their way through the texts.</p> <p>\"These apps are about making Shakespeare accessible for everyone,\" said Matt Harvey, Cambridge University Press' marketing director, speaking at the apps' launch event in London.</p> <p>Agant's managing director Dave Addey elaborated on the theme: \"The thing we wanted to achieve more than anything else with these apps was to give people a way into the plays, particularly if they hadn't studied Shakespeare before, or found it intimidating.\"</p> <p>That doesn't mean dumbing down, though. At the core of both apps is what CUP refers to as \"the definitive texts\" of the plays, with the interactive features all geared towards helping people understand and enjoy that text, rather than leading them away from it.</p> <p>\"We're very keen that this should be all about the play: the play's the thing!\" said John Pettigrew, CUP's digital strategic development manager, who was executive producer for the project. \"If the app is taking people away from the play too much, it's not doing the job we want them to do.\"</p> <p>Addey said this was one reason video performances weren't included in the apps.</p> <p>\"If you include video, people will watch the video and they won't look at the text: you physically can't watch and read at the same time,\" he said. \"If you have audio playing along with the text, you can study the text and get a better understanding of the words.\"</p> <p>Pettigrew said that the apps cost \"in the mid five-figures\" to develop, with the costs being shared between CUP and Agant. The pair are hoping to launch four more Shakespeare plays over the next 2-3 months, using the engine developed for the first two releases.</p> <h2>Premium pricing</h2> <p>Both apps cost \u00a39.99 on the App Store. Pettigrew said that CUP settled on the price early in the development process, taking heart from the success of similarly-premium book-apps like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/jul/20/touch-press-book-apps-success\">The Elements</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/mar/13/peppa-pig-iphone-ipad-sales\">The Magic of Reality</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/aug/08/ipad-the-waste-land-app\">The Waste Land</a> on the App Store.</p> <p>\"It was a deliberate decision to pitch it as a premium app, which gave us a licence to do it properly,\" said Pettigrew. \"It was one of the least contentious issues in the development process. \"We knew if we fixed that price, it gave us a target for what we were trying to achieve.\"</p> <p>The engine isn't fixed in stone, though. Pettigrew says CUP and Agant will be monitoring feedback and adding new features for the upcoming apps, which will also roll back into Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet. There is also scope to use the engine for CUP's other, non-Shakespeare books.</p> <p>As part of the development of the first two apps, Cambridge girls' school St Mary's tested them with a group of Year 9 students.</p> <p>Headmistress Charlotte Avery spoke at the launch event about the experience, saying that her students have been \"incredibly positive\" about using the apps.</p> <p>She praised the circles feature, the glossary and the ability to listen to the audio performance in the background while making notes in another application. \"For young people to use technology like this, it is another way of basically making Shakespeare cool,\" said Avery.</p> <p>\"The girls are coming to the end of Act 3 of Romeo and Juliet, and they cannot wait to get back after half-term to continue. They are very excited about this. The apps are innovative and useful, and the students love them.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398619007\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351687342021/shak.jpg\" alt=\"Explore Shakespeare iPad apps\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interactive word clouds and character circles are among the features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>iPad apps are only part of CUP's digital media strategy, though. \"We can do fantastic things here for Shakespeare, but most of our customers don't have iPads, so that can't be the core,\" said Pettigrew.</p> <p>\"How do we serve the main group of customers? That's where things like the web come in. We have to get the balance right between doing the best thing for a particular platform, and serving all our customers' needs.\"</p> <p>For apps, this may require looking beyond iPad. Pettigrew says that Apple's device is the main product being chosen by British schools who are buying tablets for their students to use, but that other countries \u2013&nbsp;Turkey and India, for example \u2013&nbsp;are \"going strongly Android\".</p> <p>Addey provided a developer's viewpoint on this, suggesting that for now, \"the only platform where people are really paying for higher-value and higher-quality apps is iOS\".</p> <p>This does not mean Agant is not keen to look beyond Apple's platform, if it sees a potential return on its investment in doing so.</p> <p>\"We would happily develop these apps for Android if the market is there. It's an opportunity cost thing: do we develop an app and then port it to Android, or do we develop another app for iPad? That's the choice we're making, and we're hoping in future the choice will be 'both'.\"</p> <h2>Book-apps innovation</h2> <p>Even so, he was enthusiastic about the experimentation that's going on around book-apps in 2012, as publishers like CUP forge partnerships with app developers.</p> <p>\"We're at the point where the 'right way' to do these things on iPad has not yet been defined. It's a brilliant place to be, because the language and grammar of how these apps work has yet to be defined,\" said Addey.</p> <p>\"It's like the early days of film, or the invention of things like tracking shots or the reverse dolly zoom. It feels like we're at a similar point with apps. It's still experimental.\"</p> <p>Yet Addey stressed that in the Explore Shakespeare apps, this experimentation is geared towards a serious goal: providing people with a way into the plays, whatever their level of knowledge or experience.</p> <p>\"This isn't frivolous: it's not dressing up Shakespeare in some frivolous way. It's true to the text,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We didn't want to dumb this down, but we wanted to help people get into it on their own terms. These plays really were the mass entertainment of their day: they weren't elitist, it was the man and woman in the street who were enjoying them.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Where are we on the post-2015 development agenda?</h2> <p>In May, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, named UK prime minister David Cameron, Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, of Indonesia, as co-chairs of <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/News/Latest-news/2012/Global-development-shaping-the-future-post-2015/\" title=\"\">a high-level panel</a> to advise him on the global development agenda after 2015, the expiry date for the millennium development goals (MDGs). That was followed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">naming of a 26-member panel</a> that will work on a report, setting out a \"bold yet practical vision\", to be submitted to Ban in May. <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/experts/kharash\" title=\"\">Homi Kharas</a>, a former World Bank economist, now at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, is the lead author of the report. The first draft is expected in March. The co-chairs and panellists are holding their first substantive meetings this week in London.</p> <h2>What is the theme of this week's meetings?</h2> <p>Household poverty is the focus this week \u2013 both defining it and looking at ways to get households out of poverty. Subsequent meetings in Liberia and Indonesia will focus on national development and global partnerships respectively, followed by a final meeting in New York in May. There will be three sessions in London. The first one takes place on Wednesday, and has been organised by No 10 and the UK's Department for International Development. It will feature several external speakers \u2013 include <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html\" title=\"\">Hans Rosling</a>, described as a data visionary \u2013 who will expose the panel to Britain's thinking and ideas.</p> <h2>What is Britain's thinking on development?</h2> <p>The prime minister has said he wants to shift the debate away from the quantity of aid given and towards what he calls the \"<a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/david-cameron-new-york-university/\" title=\"\">golden thread</a>\" of development. This involves not only aid but also stable government, lack of corruption, human rights, the rule of law and transparent information. Cameron carries clout because the UK is on course to meet the long-standing UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid next year. The UK government has protected Britain's aid budget from cuts despite grumbling from within its ranks that aid should take a hit along with other sectors of government at a time of economic crisis.</p> <h2>What has been the reaction to the golden thread?</h2> <p>Development experts have welcomed the golden thread approach, but with caveats. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-barder\" title=\"\">Owen Barder</a>, Europe director of the <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/\" title=\"\">Centre for Global Development</a> thinktank, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/27/david-cameron-development-theory-convenient\" title=\"\">says the golden thread stresses free markets</a>, jobs and growth, but not other ways to encourage positive social and economic change, such as reducing inequality, tackling the power of elites, providing social protection, and ensuring a strong voice for civil society. Ivan Lewis, Labour's shadow secretary for international development, says the 0.7% target has to be accompanied by meaningful climate change targets, the removal of barriers to fair trade, fair and transparent taxes, universal human rights, social protection, free access to quality compulsory education, and health services. The panellists will meet on their own on the second day and Friday will involve \"outreach\" to NGOs and the private sector, and discussions <a href=\"http://www.worldwewant2015.org/\" title=\"\">on how to reach out to the most excluded</a>, to get their views on the post-2015 development agenda.</p> <h2>How does the high-level panel's work fit in with Rio+20?</h2> <p>The Rio+20 summit on sustainable development, held in June, agreed a plan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/23/rio-20-earth-summit-document\" title=\"\">to set global sustainable development goals</a> that address global environmental management, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/developing-nations-fishing-protected-un\" title=\"\">protect the oceans</a>, improve food security, and promote a \"green economy\". Climate change and anti-poverty are inextricably linked. For example, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/03/eu-policy-building-resilience-disaster\" title=\"\">repeated drought in the Sahel</a> can only drive people deeper into poverty unless measures are taken to protect them from such repeated shocks. A working group is being set up following Rio+20 to work on sustainable development goals, so there are parallel tracks on a post-2015 development agenda; the trick for Ban is to combine them into one. The UN's special adviser on post-2015 development planning, Amina Mohammed, has told MPs on the development committee that both the high-level panel and the working group on sustainability <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/24/un-panel-development-goals-ambitious-timetable\" title=\"\">share one secretariat, saying the end result will be \"one development agenda\"</a>. But climate talks are making painfully slow progress, with the prospect of, at best, a weak deal in 2015 that will not come into force until 2020. \"Getting rid of poverty is about making more stuff and giving it to more people,\" said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/clairemelamed\" title=\"\">Claire Melamed</a>, head of growth and equity at the <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Overseas Development Institute</a> thinktank. \"It's a popular thing to do, but climate change is about sharing out limited resources. Politically it's of a totally different order of magnitude and so contentious.\"</p> <h2>What about the unmet MDG goals?</h2> <p>The MDGs, which were agreed in New York in September 2000, set out eight specific \u2013 and ambitious \u2013 goals for the international community, including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary school education, and reducing maternal and child <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2012/jun/14/race-against-time-health-mdg\" title=\"\">mortality rates</a>. Some of those goals in some countries are expected to be achieved by the 2015 deadline; others definitely will not. The World Bank says the <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/0,,contentMDK:23112468~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:476883,00.html\" title=\"\">goal of halving global poverty</a> will be met, as the population share of extremely poor people in developing countries is projected to fall from 29% in 1990 to 12% in 2015. The world has also met the target of halving the proportion of people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/06/water-millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">without access to improved sources of water</a>, and it has achieved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/mdgs-girls-match-boys-primary-school-enrolment\" title=\"\">parity in primary education between girls and boys</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/13/world-target-development-goal-child-mortality\" title=\"\">But the child mortality MDG is not likely to be met</a>. The high-level panel said after its first meeting at the UN general assembly in New York in September that it plans to bring this unfinished business into the new framework.</p> <h2>What should be in the next set of goals?</h2> <p>Melamed points to the differing set of circumstances confronting this panel. The MDGs, she says, were essentially cooked up by a group of rich countries deciding how they wanted to spend their aid to help poor countries. Now most poverty is in middle-income countries, many of which are themselves donors (India, for example). <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/idspublication/the-new-bottom-billion-and-the-mdgs-a-plan-of-action\">A 2010 report by Andy Sumner of the Institute of Development Studies</a> found that 70% of the world's poorest people live in middle-income countries, so tackling inequality is one of the most effective ways to accelerate progress towards eradicating poverty. But countries such as India can be expected to resist being told what to do within their borders. The panel sees the importance of taking on new challenges in a changed world in any framework. They include the importance of inclusive growth (a fallout of the Arab spring), conflict and gender equality.

  "<p>The UK's forests are under \"unprecedented threat\" from foreign pests and diseases, according to the government department responsible for the protection of forests and woodlands.</p> <p>The ash dieback fungus found in East Anglia last week is just the latest invader to pose a serious threat to UK trees, and government ecologists say that more than 3m larch trees as well as thousands of mature oaks and chestnuts have been felled in the past three years to prevent similar fatal plant diseases from spreading out of control.</p> <p>\"We are under an unprecedented level of threat from a range of exotic pests and diseases, a lot associated with the international trade in live plants,\" said the Forestry Commission. \"There are protections in place but the EU plant health regime is no longer fit for purpose. Too many pests and diseases are still getting through.\"</p> <p>More than 100,000 ash trees have already been felled to prevent the spread of ash dieback, or <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, since the disease was identified in March.</p> <p>But very many more larch trees have had to be cut down in the West Country, Wales and Scotland this year to prevent a <a href=\"http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/pestsDiseases/phytophthora/pRamorum/\" title=\"\">plant disease caused by the <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em></a> pathogen from spreading. Known as \"sudden oak death\" in the US, it so far has not infected British oaks, but since its discovery in the wild in 2009 it has been found extensively in larch populations in south-west England, Wales and south-west Scotland, resulting in many of the trees being felled over a wide area.</p> <p>\"We now have six to eight organisms in the British Isles that are a real concern. In the 1960s and 70s it was Dutch elm disease, which killed 30m trees; in the 1990s it was a new <em>Phytophthora </em>which devastated alders along riverbanks. But in the last 10 years we have had as many new diseases as we had in the previous 40 or 50 years,\" said Joan Webber, principal pathologist at <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestresearch\" title=\"\">Forest Research</a>, the Forestry Commission's research arm.</p> <p>Plant experts are particularly concerned about the oak processionary moth, which arrived in west London in 2009 and has now developed two major populations. \"It has the potential to spread anywhere there are oak trees. It is extending its range and has become established in the Netherlands and Belgium, possibly as a result of climate change and warmer winters,\" says the Forestry Commission.</p> <p>Plant pathogens are on the rise globally and Britain is particularly susceptible because of its increasingly warm, wet winters and because it is a centre of world trade. Easy access to plants from around the world has encouraged gardeners to buy millions of exotic plants, many of which can arrive diseased. Some plants can only enter Britain with \"passports\", but the majority of diseases are only identifiable in laboratories.</p> <p>The diseases and pests can arrive by several routes, say ecologists. In March, more than 250 live larvae of the <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/HCOU-4U4J45\" title=\"\">Asian longhorn beetle</a>, which can kill oak and willows, were found in trees in Kent. More than 2,000 trees had to be felled and burned. It was thought to have entered in wooden packaging for Chinese stone.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/redbandneedleblight\" title=\"\">Dothistroma needle blight</a>, which affects a range of conifer species, threatens commercial forests by significantly reducing timber yields. It has been found in all of the commission's forest districts in England and Scotland, and three out of four forest districts in Wales.</p> <p>Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum at Kew Gardens, which has 14,000 trees and has seen many attacked in the past few years, said some of the most serious threats came from the <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/INFD-6URJCF\" title=\"\">oak processionary moth</a>. The caterpillars can cause serious defoliation and weaken oaks to the point where they are prone to other diseases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398651506\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/10/31/1351684184024/Ash-tree-disease-001.png\" alt=\"Ash tree disease\" width=\"460\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ash tree disease.

  "<p>With a year to go, there's a lot at stake for the government's radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/oct/01/benefits-universal-credit-scheme\" title=\"\">universal credit plan</a>. The new scheme will sweep away the main existing benefits, replacing them with one integrated system which, it's claimed, will be simpler and make working more financially worthwhile. Laudable aims. But will it work?</p> <p>Many questions still hang over the new scheme, and inevitably some of the changes will be controversial. The difficulties of making families claim their entitlement online and the risks of paying benefits monthly to low-incomes families who often budget weekly, have been the focus of <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/research/welfare-reform/sink-or-swim-the-impact-of-the-universal-credit/\" title=\"\">lots of debate</a> recently. But the central aims of the policy \u2013 simplification and better work incentives \u2013 remain on course, right? <a href=\"http://www.cesi.org.uk/keypolicy/implementing-universal-credit-will-reforms-improve-service-users-0\" title=\"\">Tuesday's report from Inclusion and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> highlights some concerns.</p> <p>The government's labour market gurus think an extra 300,000 people will find jobs as a result. Universal credit will make it pay to work just a few hours per week, whereas the current system encourages people to work for 16 hours each week or not at all. But the new system will make work pay more for some families but less for others. The flip side of encouraging out-of-work parents to work a handful of hours each week is that working parents may also find it pays to work fewer hours and claim more universal credit. As the JRF report highlights, incentives to work for 16 hours per week, or full-time, will be reduced for some.</p> <p>To prevent that from happening, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) plans to introduce so-called \"in-work conditionality\" which will threaten some claimants with reductions in their universal credit payments if they don't extend their hours once in work. While the old system offered a financial carrot to increase your hours of work, the new one will replace it with a financial stick if you don't. In a labour market where around 1.4 million people are currently involuntarily under-employed, that's likely to entail some rough justice.</p> <p>But the cold hard numbers are only part of the story when it comes to encouraging people back work. Part of work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith's case was that the byzantine complexity of the benefits system was also at fault, preventing claimants from understanding how much better-off they could be in work.</p> <p>Here the DWP team behind universal credit are surely right in their diagnosis that you need a computer to understand how much you might get. But correctly identifying the problem isn't the same as finding a solution. And as the universal credit plans take shape, it seems that complexity in the new scheme is mounting.</p> <p>For example, there will be a fiendishly complicated system of family specific \"earnings disregards\" \u2013 that's the amount you can earn before they start to take your benefits away. I don't recommend you try it at home, but if you really want to work out your own \"disregard\" you may need to brush up on your arithmetic first.</p> <p>The simplification agenda has also been undermined by policy changes beyond DWP's control. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/25/council-tax-reform-ifs\" title=\"\">Council tax benefit</a>, for example, will be administered locally from April 2013 and most councils will have no choice but to cut it. As the JRF report notes, the consequence will be \"a plethora of different local arrangements\". So much for a simple system: not only will you need a computer to work out your benefit entitlement, you'll need a map too.</p> <p>Whenever the benefit system is reformed there are likely to be objections. The trouble for universal credit is that some of its most trumpeted advantages <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/05/universal-credit-welfare-reform\" title=\"\">are not quite what they seemed</a>. In every area of detail the policy is bogged-down in the inevitable trade-offs of welfare policy: simplicity versus cost; carrots versus sticks; incentives to increase working hours or incentives to work at all? This was a policy designed before economic stagnation set in. But with the public finances under intense pressure, and no money to play with, those difficult trade-offs aren't getting any easier.</p>",

Having looked at the evidence, I think I'd now answer them as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 Should the UK really be stopping building onshore windfarms after those in the system are built?</p> </blockquote> <p>That depends. Assuming you accept the UK's carbon targets, it would only make sense to stop building onshore wind if: (a) we're confident that the rest of our carbon cutting plans are on track and (b) we're more worried about the visual impact of turbines than rising energy bills. Neither of these conditions currently apply in my view, though (b) in particular is a subjective matter.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 How does Decc's 13GW onshore wind target fit with the UK's overall 2020 target for renewable energy?</p> </blockquote> <p>The 13GW figure is a projection, not a target. If we exceed it, we'll cut ourselves more slack in other areas, which can't be a bad thing.</p> <blockquote> \u2022 How does the 13GW target fit with the UK's carbon targets? </blockquote> <p>Figures from the CCC suggest that we should be able to meet our carbon targets if we slightly exceed the 13GW projection \u2013 which we look set to do. That's encouraging, though whether it's enough will depend on the rest of our carbon cutting progress \u2013 and as CCC has often pointed out, it's not clear from the underlying trends that we're currently on track in most areas.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 What does opting in or out of new onshore wind mean for future energy bills?</p> </blockquote> <p>It's almost certain that our energy bills are going to go up in the coming decade \u2013 both due to rising fossil fuel prices and the need to cut carbon. Of the mature low-carbon energy sources, however, onshore wind is the cheapest, which implies that the more turbines we build on land, the less we'll need to spend overall.</p> <p>That wraps up the discussion. Thanks to everyone who has been in touch with comments, contributions and suggestions.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T17:49:08.165Z\">at 5.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50915fa495cb39eabe475e9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T17:28:05.066Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the energy bills question, the chart below from the Committee on Climate Change shows a breakdown of the predicted increase in energy bills between 2010 and 2020.

Of course, either or both predictions could turn out to be overly pessimistic or optimistic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ff769350-b296-4b76-a3bd-09bbe09e4b29\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351702568505/-460.png\" alt=\"Energy bill scenarios from the CCC\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Energy bill scenarios from the Committee on Climate Change  Photograph: Committee on Climate Change</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: /Committee on Climate Change</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a financial perspective, you can read this either way: a demonstration that subsidies to wind and other green technologies are driving up bills, or proof that in a world with rising fossil fuel prices it makes sense to invest in carbon cutting now in order to avoid being overly locked into gas, coal and oil generation.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, a purely financial analysis is academic as we're also seeking to reduce carbon emissions. So unless you reject the country's carbon targets (which many do of course, especially on the Tory right), the real question is what is the least expensive way to keep the lights on while also meeting our carbon budgets.</p> <p>That too is a complex question. Economists such as <a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/\">Dieter Helm</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Carbon-Crunch-Getting-Climate/dp/0300186592\">have argued</a> that the correct path is simply to set a high carbon tax and see which technologies step up. But others such as <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/robert.gross\">Rob Gross</a> of Imperial College London <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/research_centre/?6263\">disagree</a>, arguing that renewables need and deserve targeted support.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509155c295cb39eabe475e94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T16:45:58.235Z\">4.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another point that often crops up in the onshore wind debate is the question of whether the turbines actually reduce carbon emissions as promised. Critics of wind energy argue that the results are poor because gas plants need to be kept running on \"standby\" in case the wind stops blowing. This claim was repeated today by Tory MP Chris Heaton Harris, who <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225531/Minister-signals-end-wind-farm-We-pepper-turbines-country--declares-energy-minister.html\">told the Daily Mail</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>[Mr Hayes\u2019s remarks are] a huge step forward. These awful turbines do nothing for the environment \u2013 they barely reduce CO2 \u2013 they force up energy bills and put more people into fuel poverty.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, this argument appears to be inconsistent with the evidence according to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/26/myth-wind-turbines-carbon-emissions\">a recent piece of analysis</a> carried out by low-carbon energy advocates Chris Goodall and Mark Lynas. Looking at real-world data on wind speeds and power generation, they found that:</p> <blockquote> <p>From analysing <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlKCs3nBXhgZdFkxYzc4VVpwQ0ZsenNocVVkTnNCUXc\">National Grid data of more than 4,000 half-hour periods over the last three months</a>, a strong correlation between windiness and a reduction in gas-fired generation becomes clear. The exchange rate is about one for one: a megawatt hour of wind typically meant the UK grid used one less megawatt hour of gas-derived electricity. This means that actual CO2 savings can be calculated from the data with a high degree of accuracy \u2013 these are not guesstimates from models, but observations of real-world data.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is shown in the graph below, which plots generation from wind and gas over three consecutive days in September. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/26/myth-wind-turbines-carbon-emissions\">full blog post</a> is worth a read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-952b853e-c8f5-4700-8ee5-6cb73ab68ccb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351701535497/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Wind power replacing gas power in the UK in September 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind power replacing gas power in September in the UK Photograph: Guardian/Chris Goodall/Mark Lynas</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: /Guardian / Chris Goodall / Mark Lynas</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50914e05b57959e43bca950e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T16:12:55.031Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I want to look next at the cost of onshore wind energy. Our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/25/climate-change-windpower\">background guide</a> from a few weeks concluded that:</p> <blockquote> <p>Onshore wind has the advantage of being one of the <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Media/Releases/2012/MR110612-review-evidence-about-onshore-wind-power.aspx\">most affordable renewable energy sources</a>. Generating electricity from onshore wind turbines typically costs around 7\u20139p per kWh, which is around half the cost of offshore wind and a quarter of the costs of solar photovoltaic panels. It is also slightly cheaper, on average, than nuclear power. Onshore wind generation is still slightly more expensive than fossil fuels (generating electricity from gas power plants currently costs between 4.1 and 7.5 p/kWh), but its price is expected to fall in the coming years.</p> </blockquote> <p>The implication is that if we're to stick with our carbon targets but have less onshore wind, then energy bills will rise. This is emphasised by two statements just in from leading UK energy experts. Professor Philip Heptonstall of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) and Imperial College London:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe evidence shows that onshore wind in the UK is amongst the lowest cost per unit of electricity produced from the available suite of low carbon power generation options. It follows that preventing the construction of appropriately sited onshore wind farms will make consumers\u2019 bills higher than they would otherwise be.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Michael Grubb, Chair of Energy and Climate Policy at Cambridge University, agrees:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cOnshore wind turbines must be carefully and properly sited. But this intervention is nonsensical. At a time of wrenching fuel bills, serious questions need to be asked about why Junior Minister John Hayes is unilaterally advocating a policy to try and block one of our cheapest renewable energy resources and thus drive up everyone\u2019s energy bills.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T16:38:01.800Z\">at 4.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-509147efb57959e43bca9508\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T15:47:53.974Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a map <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/feb/06/wind-farm-map-mps\">we made earlier this year</a> showing wind farms across the UK at various stages of the planning process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;amp;q=select+col0+from+18qmes8ba-SC_2knKavaJtDwivewagUIfwKgScGI&amp;amp;h=false&amp;amp;lat=55.0334630545537&amp;amp;lng=-3.5425716162500365&amp;amp;z=6&amp;amp;t=1&amp;amp;l=col0&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Whether or not this counts as Britain being \"peppered\" with turbines, as Hayes provocatively argued, is ultimately a value judgement.

In the meantime here's a graph showing the anticipated increase in onshore wind capacity in a sample energy scenario from the CCC.

By those terms Hayes is correct, though it's not clear that the rest of the economy is on-track to stay within its carbon budgets, in which case perhaps we'll need more wind power after all.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_104/pn11_104.aspx\">government believes the UK is on track</a> to hit its carbon targets but but interventions from the CCC over the years have suggested that many of the cuts achieved so far are not the result of climate change policies and that underlying progress isn't fast enough. For example, in their <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/reports/3rd-progress-report\">3rd Progress Report</a>, the CCC stated last year that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The pace of underlying emissions reductions achieved in 2010 would, if continued, be insufficient to meet the second and third carbon budgets. In addition, it is not clear whether this rate of progress could be sustained under current policies [\u2026] Therefore a step change in the pace of underlying emissions reductions is still required to meet the currently legislated budgets.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6f198249-a4d2-4843-b66a-1a65d1689a29\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351694467697/-392.png\" alt=\"UK onshore wind power in sample CCC scenario\" width=\"392\" height=\"235\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Installed capacity of onshore wind power in a sample scenario from the Committee on Climate Change</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: /Data from the Committee on Climate Change</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T15:01:44.885Z\">at 3.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5091324b95cb39eabe475e6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T14:14:35.470Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carbonbrief\" data-user-id=\"223416400\">@carbonbrief </a>who just tweeted me to flag up <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/10/untangling-john-hayes-on-wind-power\">their analysis of the situation</a>, which is well worth a read. They highlight the point I was going to make next \u2013 that the government's 13GW figure for onshore wind isn't actually a target, just a projection.</p> <p>The target is 15% of <em>energy</em> being generated from renewable sources by 2020 \u2013 which the government hopes to hit by generating 30% of <em>electricity</em> from renewables. The more onshore wind we build, the less we'll need to achieve on other fronts, such as marine, solar and biomass. And since wind power is the cheapest large-scale source of renewable power, exceeding the projection has the capacity to save the country money.</p> <p>Ed Davey made this same point in his <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/edd_onshwind/edd_onshwind.aspx\">clarification</a> earlier:</p> <blockquote> <p>There are no targets - or caps - for individual renewable technologies such as onshore wind. Nor are there reviews being done of onshore wind on the basis of landscape or property values.</p> <p>What we\u2019re currently consulting on are ways of making sure local communities feel the benefit of hosting wind farms, and whether our understanding of future costs is accurate.</p> <p>Onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables, which is why we\u2019ve been able to cut the subsidy. It has an important role to play in our energy future.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T14:19:05.194Z\">at 2.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50912db5b57959e43bca94ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T13:55:01.972Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I'm going to do more digging on the numbers soon, but in the meantime it's perhaps worth clarifying a common point of confusion with energy statistics: the distinction between capacity (the flow of power generated when a wind farm is working flat out) and generation (the number of units of power produced over a month or year).</p> <p>All the figures mentioned at the start of this blog refer to capacity. How much a given level of capacity generates depends on how much the wind blows, which can vary from month to month or year to year. But the government <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/renewable_ener/re_roadmap/re_roadmap.aspx\">Roadmap</a> (see page 31) estimates the the 13GW (billion watts) of onshore wind capacity it expects to see installed by 2020 will generate around 32TWh (trillion watt hours) per year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/peoplepages/roberts.html\">Steve Roberts of Oxford University</a> has just been in touch on this subject. He writes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>Having read (rapidly!) the wind farm section of the govt report, it appears to me that it does rather muddy the distinction between installed capacity (which they give in GW) and actual output (which they give in TWhr/yr). The numbers in the report of 4GW installed wind generators giving 7TWhr/yr mean that the actual output is an average of 0.8GW - i.e. 20% of capacity actually delivered \u2013 which is pretty good given wind\u2019s variability, but still about the same as a single coal-fired power station. When it comes to \u201chow much wind power do we need to replace capacity loss over the next 5-10 years\u201d, this 5-fold difference between installed capacity (maximum if the wind blew strong all the time) and deliverable capacity (about 20% of that, maybe less given a lot of prime sites are I guess already used) has to be taken into account; and this distinction does seem to be getting lost somewhere along the way.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091278195cb39eabe475e63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T13:28:33.525Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.r-e-a.net/\">REA</a> (Renewable Energy Association), has issued this statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>We very much welcome that Minister John Hayes recognises renewables have a crucial part to play in the future of the UK energy mix.

Ministers' public disagreements on renewable energy policy are damaging to investor confidence. The public would be best served by a cross-party consensus on investment in energy infrastructure. The Coalition really needs to put the national interest ahead of party-politics given the gravity of our energy challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>The concern that coalition political point scoring is undermining investor confidence is a recurring theme in the UK energy debate at the moment. Haynor continues:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is important to note that communities have benefitted from wind farms in various ways, including significant funds for community based projects relating to education, the environment and energy saving.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing positive and proactive leadership from central Government, with the publication of the Energy Bill, to give industry the confidence to deliver the modern infrastructure we need, and hope to meet with the Minister soon to discuss how renewable energy is not just about reducing carbon but is also crucial for jobs, skills and growth in the economy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50912201b57959e43bca94e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T13:05:05.106Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_joffe\">@david_joffe</a> who just tweeted me a link to the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/reports/2012-progress-report\">last progress report from the Committee on Climate Change</a>, the government's advisers on climate and related energy issues.

Of the stock of projects awaiting approval, only 1.5 GW were determined, increasing the stock of projects awaiting approval to 8.7 GW at the end of 2011. The majority (64%) of this capacity is in Scotland. This stock of onshore projects (added to those already deployed and in or awaiting construction) would be more than sufficient to deliver the 2020 capacity in our indicator trajectory (i.e. 15 GW) if historic approval rates continue.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T13:14:25.732Z\">at 1.14pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50911ea495cb39eabe475e59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T12:50:44.604Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Damian Carrington has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/31/john-hayes-wind-power-spin\">published a blog looking at some of the issues and political differences behind the story</a>. He writes that Hayes's intervention is \"either a clever but cynical piece of spin or an abandoning of the national interest to placate a noisy minority. It could in fact be both.\"</p> <p>Carrington believes Hayes's aim is to trim wind subsidies but argues this would be a mistake, both in terms of climate change and energy bills:</p> <blockquote> <p>Opinion polls have shown time after time that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/wind-shale-gas-icm-poll\">public overwhelmingly supports wind power</a>, even when close to their homes. They understand that the real threat to our green and pleasant land comes from climate change and the ever weirder weather it brings: the floods that devastated middle England in 2000 were made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/16/climate-change-risk-uk-floods\">three times more likely by global warming</a>.</p> <p>Hayes has also betrayed energy bill payers at a time when bills are soaring so high that the Prime minister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan\">felt forced to invent new policy</a> on the hoof. Here are the facts. Clean energy is not optional, either because of legally binding carbon targets or practical energy security concerns, and onshore wind is the cheapest form of low-carbon energy. It <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2012/feb/29/electricity-generating-costs?intcmp=239\">costs about the same as gas</a> \u2013 without the greenhouse gases. Rejecting onshore wind farms means pushing up homeowners' energy bills \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p>I'll come back to these two topics below.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50910ca2b57986a0fe1d49a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T11:39:06.330Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Background</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Energy minister John Hayes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\">sparked a huge row in government</a> on Tuesday when he claimed <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225531/Minister-signals-end-wind-farm-We-pepper-turbines-country--declares-energy-minister.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\">in newspaper interviews</a> that the country is \"peppered\" with onshore windfarms and that \"enough is enough\".</p> <p>More specifically, he claimed that:</p> <blockquote> <p>Even if a minority of [the onshore wind] in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 target [on renewable energy, to provide 15% of UK's energy from renewable sources]</p> </blockquote> <p>But is that true?</p> <p>A quick glance at <a href=\"http://www.bwea.com/statistics/\">wind industry statistics</a> shows that:</p> <p>\u2022 5.0GW, or 357 windfarms, of onshore are wind already built&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 2.1GW, or 90, are in construction</p> <p>\u2022 3.9GW, or 272, are consented</p> <p>\u2022 7.4GW, or 356, are in planning</p> <p>Which tots up to 18.4GW \u2013 far more than the 13GW listed in the Department of Energy and Climate Change's <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/renewable_ener/re_roadmap/re_roadmap.aspx\">Renewable Energy Roadmap</a>. These figures suggest that only 27% of what's in planning needs to be built to hit targets, implying that Hayes may be correct \u2013 especially given that consents for windfarms over the last year are at record highs according to trade body <a href=\"http://www.renewableuk.com/\">RenewableUK</a>.</p> <p>All this raises lots of questions, including:</p> <p>\u2022 Should the UK really be stopping building onshore windfarms after those in the system are built?</p> <p>\u2022 How does Decc's 13GW onshore wind target fit with the UK's overall 2020 target for renewable energy?</p> <p>\u2022 How does the 13GW target fit with the UK's carbon targets?</p> <p>\u2022 What does opting in or out of new onshore wind mean for future energy bills?</p> <p>I'm going to explore these questions below with help from experts and readers.

Newer models of collaborative, cluster and locality work within Academies, Federations and teaching schools are exciting additions to the future of education; autonomy of budgets, teachers pay and conditions and a curriculum with more creativity and skill based opportunities will encourage young people to access education and moreover enjoy education.

  "<p>You generally only get one crack at giving a talk at one of the famed TED series of global conferences. So imagine you run a global car company \u2013 what's your big-hitter topic going to be? Formula One family wagons? Hydrogen hybrids? Flying cars?</p> <p>Well, not for Bill Ford, at least. The executive chairman of US automotive giant Ford Motor Company devoted his <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_ford_a_future_beyond_traffic_gridlock.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">18 precious minutes</a> to the profoundly unsexy subject of \u2013 wait for it \u2013 congestion. Yes, congestion: that infuriating moment of being stuck behind the wheel, engines chugging, inching forward at snail's pace.</p> <p>Bill Ford's message was blunt. To paraphrase, it goes something like this: if you think traffic is bad now, just you wait. There are 800m cars on the world's roads. That could jump to 2bn, if not more, by 2050. Ahead, in short, lies \"global gridlock\".</p> <p>\"Today, the average American spends the equivalent of almost a full week, every year, stuck in traffic jams. And that's a huge waste of time and resources \u2026 When you factor in the expected population growth, it becomes very clear that the mobility model we have today, simply will not work tomorrow,\" said Bill Ford during his TED talk last year.</p> <p>Congestion isn't just a private annoyance. Chugging engines mean more carbon being pumped into the atmosphere. More hours in traffic (in 2010, a 100km tailback on one of China's national highways took more than 10 days to clear) also translates into fewer hours of productive economic activity.</p> <p>So what can be done? Congestion, in essence, can be nailed down to capacity. Our roads simply aren't capable of handling more cars. An obvious solution is to add more roads. Obvious, but insane. Insane in the Einstein sense of doing the same thing repeatedly and hoping for a different result. As Ford points out, when America began moving west, it didn't add more wagons, it built railroads. The same logic needs to be applied to global gridlock.</p> <p>\"What we need is an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimise personal mobility on a massive scale \u2026 that is the kind of system that will make the future of personal mobility sustainable,\" Ford concludes.</p> <p>Bill Ford laid out what that vision looks like when he announced the company's <a href=\"http://media.ford.com/news/billfordoutlinesblueprintformobilityvisioncallsonmobileindustrytohelpdeveloptransportationsolutions.htm\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blueprint for Mobility</a> during an address at the 2012 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier this year. And Wulf-Peter Schmidt, sustainability manager for Ford in Europe, suggests there are two areas to tackle in bringing the company's vision to a reality: political and technological.</p> <p>On the public policy side, the biggest priority is to get all the key folk around the same table. Cara McLaughlin, spokesperson for the <a href=\"http://www.acea.be/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">European Automobile Manufacturers' Association</a>, says: \"We really need a concerted effort to tackle the issue of congestion. All transport modes need to have a role to play, as well as all the different players \u2013 infrastructure managers, logistics, policy makers, automotive companies, urban planners and so on.\"</p> <p>That's beginning to happen. At a European level, the <a href=\"http://www.civitas.eu/index.php?id=69\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civitas scheme</a>, which is co-funded by the EU, is pulling in city authorities from across Europe to share best practice on establishing a culture of clean mobility. The most innovative examples, such as integrated parking and travel schemes and hybrid bus priority schemes, are on show in five demonstration projects across 25 cities. The problem, McLaughlin says, is that it's mostly the \"good students\" sitting at the table.</p> <p>Although public purses are tied tight these days, money has to be found for infrastructure investment. Schmidt says cars are only \"one part of a system\". Complementarity, not competition, between transport modes has to be the way forward. An example of joined-up infrastructure is the \"Park and Ride\" concept, which allows drivers to park on the edge of town and catch a bus or train into the city centre.</p> <p>The automotive industry likes the idea of complementarity because it keeps people buying cars \u2013 albeit for use over shorter distances. Sharing is another solution that falls into the same camp. \"Look around the streets of any European city and they are absolutely lined with inactive metal,\" points out Rupert Fausset, transport expert at UK thinktank Forum for the Future. He cites the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/02/le-bluecar-car-share-scheme-paris\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Autolib</a> electric car sharing service in Paris as a sign of things to come.</p> <p>\"The average car gets used only a tiny fraction of the time. People use it for a hour to commute and then it just sits around. It's a crazy waste of resources. With car clubs, one car is parked locally and it might be used by 50 different people\", explains Fausset.</p> <p>One of the factors pushing the growth of car-sharing clubs such as ZipCar is technology. Online booking, app-enabled location devices and suchlike have made these \"smart mobility\" models not only possible, but easy.</p> <p>Take the online service <a href=\"https://www.liftshare.com/uk/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liftshare</a>, which has received a grant from the UK Technology Strategy Board, a government-funded body which promotes technology-led innovation in business. Until recently, sharing a ride to work was something arranged at the office water cooler. The internet has changed all that, with office-workers now linking up with a much wider pool of drivers.</p> <p>Another recipient of the board's support is <a href=\"http://openhighstreet.com/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open High Street</a>. Piloted in Herefordshire, the project enables shoppers to buy online from independent high-street stores. The goods are then aggregated and delivered by a single courier. Tesco Direct for small stores, if you like.</p> <p>The automotive industry is pushing the technology card hard. \"Interconnectivity\" between vehicles and infrastructure, for instance, is a boom business among software and telematics firms. Imagine as a driver having real-time data about hold-ups ahead or information on empty car-parking spaces.</p> <p>\"The ideal is to end up with a scenario where you tell your tech that you want to get from here to there, and then it outlines what's the most efficient and most sustainable way,\" says Schmidt.</p> <p>Another example of clever tech is automated driving. The technology (not to mention the law) still has some way to go before we will see automated cars on our roads, but Google has reached an advanced stage of testing and recently announced its intention to <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/25/google_automatic_cars_legal/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">make self-driving cars available</a> within five years.</p> <p>Important as technology is, solutions to gridlock cannot only be tech-driven, says Richard Kemp-Harper, lead technologist for transport at Technology Strategy Board. \"Technology is an enabler,\" he says. \"Ultimately, we need to look at this at a systems level. Not just what's the road problem or the rail problem, but looking at how the transport system works.\"</p> <p><em>Guardian Sustainable Business have partnered with Ford to bring a range of European transport experts together to explore the future of mobility on 14 November.

From her alfresco table in a Rome restaurant, newly divorced Elizabeth Gilbert, played by Julia Roberts, watches an infatuated couple kiss. We see the torture in her eyes. When her plate of spaghetti arrives, however, she is all consumed by its splendour; we can almost smell its delights wafting forth: the sauce obviously reduced just so, the green of the basil playing off the red tomatoes and a sprinkle of parmesan \u2013 bon app\u00e9tit! A brief naughty smile appears and hunger fires across her eyes as she savours each mouthful; the plate quickly cleaned.

  "<p>Over the past month, two New York Times columnists have displayed brave and extraordinary journalistic integrity that deserves commendation. Both instances pertain to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/24/jimmy-savile-bbc-story-so-far\">the still-growing scandal</a> that BBC senior executives <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/27/jimmy-savile-bbc-policy-newsnight\">suppressed the media outlet's own investigation</a> into the alleged serial pedophilia of Jimmy Savile, one of Britain's most beloved TV celebrities whose highly popular BBC show was aimed at teenagers. </p> <p>What makes this story relevant to the New York Times is that the BBC's director general at the time the Savile story was killed, Mark Thompson, was <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/times-co-names-mark-thompson-chief-executive/\">selected last August</a> as the new president and chief executive officer of the New York Times Co. The announcement was made by Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman of the Times Company and the newspaper's publisher.</p> <p>Since then, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9643942/Mark-Thompson-was-wilfully-ignorant-about-Jimmy-Savile-abuse.html\">serious questions have arisen</a> over what Thompson's role was, if any, in the killing of the Savile story, and whether he has given accurate and credible accounts of his knowledge of that episode. For obvious reasons, the New York Times has more of an interest than any other institution in determining what responsibility its incoming CEO and president bears for these sordid matters. </p> <p>But, for equally obvious reasons, it is difficult to expect that Times reporters and editors will be dogged in investigating the role played by their new corporate boss. That is particularly true given that Thompson was selected and publicly heralded by the long-time controlling Sulzberger family as the savior of the struggling Times. Any journalistic investigation by the Times into Thompson's behavior would, in essence, be directly adverse to the corporate interests of the company that employs those journalists.</p> <p>None of those concerns, however, remotely deterred the paper's new intrepid Public Editor, Margaret Sullivan. In <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/times-must-aggressively-cover-mark-thompsons-role-in-bbcs-troubles/\">a 23 October blog post</a>, she unflinchingly laid out all the facts surrounding the scandal and the questions about Thompson's role, and then argued: \"It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.\" </p> <p>Noting that \"one of the most difficult challenges for news organizations is reporting on what goes on inside their own corporate walls,\" Sullivan demanded that the Times aggressively investigate Thompson's conduct:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"All these questions ought to be asked. I hope The Times rises to the challenge and thoroughly reports what it finds. The Times might start by publishing an in-depth interview with Mr. Thompson exploring what exactly he knew, and when, about what happened at the BBC. What are the implications of these problems for him as incoming Times chief executive? What are the implications for the Times Company to have its new C.E.O. \u2013 who needs to deal with many tough business challenges here \u2013 arriving with so much unwanted baggage?</p> <p>\"As the BBC has found out in the most painful way, for The Times to pull its punches will not be a wise way to go.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As impressive as Sullivan's post was - and it was indeed impressive and literally inspiring - the nature of Sullivan's job with the Times is such that this type of independence is possible, even encouraged. The contract for the public editor position provides that the person will be employed for 18 months but no longer, so there is no chance of being re-hired, thus removing any incentive to curry favor with corporate bosses. And <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/thepubliceditor/index.html\">she</a> \"works outside of the reporting and editing structure of the newspaper\" to ensure independence.</p> <p>Still, Sullivan has a long career in journalism ahead of her, and it is the rare journalist who would be willing to ruffle feathers and directly challenge the corporate bosses at an institution as influential as the New York Times (indeed, the first three Times Public Editors rarely challenged editorial practices in any meaningful way). Yet, as Dan Gillmor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/26/margaret-sullivan-new-york-times-public-editor\">recently documented in the Guardian</a>, Sullivan has done so repeatedly already in her short tenure, and her post demanding a real investigation by the Times into Thompson's conduct was the most impressive example yet.</p> <p>In contrast to Sullivan, Times columnist Joe Nocera works within the paper's traditional editorial hierarchy and has none of the contractual protections given to the public editor. Nonetheless, he devoted <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/opinion/nocera-the-times-gets-a-new-ceo.html?_r=0\">his column this week</a> to questioning whether the incoming president and CEO, as the headline put it, \"is the right man for the job?\"</p> <p>Nocera (whose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/opinion/nocera-standing-up-to-the-ncaa.html?_r=0\">series of expos\u00e9s on the NCAA's tyranny</a> deserves a Pulitzer Prize) began by highlighting the Times' corporate struggles and the difficulty of trying to recruit someone for this position given the stranglehold of control the Sulzberger family has long exerted on the paper. Despite the significance to the paper of Thompson's hiring, Nocera writes that \"since early October, all anybody has asked about Thompson are those two most damning of questions: what did he know, and when did he know it?\"</p> <p>After reviewing the evidence that puts Thompson in a negative light, Nocera provides his own answer to those questions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A few months later, the news broke in the British press that the BBC had, as The Daily Mail put it in a headline, 'shelved Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation 'to protect its own reputation.' Given the seriousness of sexual abuse allegations \u2014 look at what it did to Penn State \u2014 you would think that Thompson and his underlings would immediately want to get to the bottom of it. But, again, they did nothing. </p> <p>\"Thompson winds up appearing willfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organization the BBC was when Thompson was running it \u2014 and what kind of leader he was. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he'd be at The Times.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>After noting that Sulzberger \"is backing his man unreservedly\", Nocera concludes his column with this warning: \"let's hope his faith in Thompson is warranted. Otherwise, the BBC won't be the only organization being asked tough questions about its judgment.\"</p> <p>The hallmark of good journalism, what is most missing from the profession, is a willingness to adversarially challenge those who wield power even at the risk of one's own reputation or career. Few acts evince that noble attribute as well as a journalist who aims their adversarial scrutiny at their own corporate employers and publishers. Journalistic malfeasance is all too common, so it is worth taking a moment to behold, and applaud, what real journalistic courage and integrity looks like. Let us hope that the integrity displayed by Sullivan and Nocera proves to be contagious.</p>",

When he came back, he asked to leave. Scarborough were 1-0 down and it was the season that Aldershot went bust. Aldershot only had a few fit players and not a full bench but they still managed to outclass the Seadogs. My mate dangled the carrot of some girl I had got off with at his party coming round and away we left. Scarborough lost the game 2-0 in the end.</p> <p>It was a good decision to leave the game. Aldershot went bust and the League decided that all results involving Aldershot were null and void. I think Scarborough moved up three places as most of the other teams lost points. Hilariously, the girl left me for one of the Scarborough players.</p> <p>The only other time was when I went on the pitch to discuss the arts of refereeing with the ref. After telling him how his performance was less than impressive, I returned to my seat to be thrown out of the ground. From the resulting action Scarborough scored an equaliser and I was lucky enough to hear the cheer as I walked home.

I was proud of the fortitude shown by my fellow sufferers. The game restarted and we pulled two back. The home crowd's loyalty and trust in their team was being rewarded and hopes were rising.</p> <p>Then with 15 minutes to go, Newcastle scored again. Kenny Wharton I think. It brought a new intensity to the old adage that one can deal with the despair, it's the hope that kills you. The ground began to empty like a fourth pint on Friday night. With five minutes remaining, three of the four stands looked like a midweek crowd at Headingley, while the fourth bounced and rocked with black and white joy.</p> <p>Then Rangers scored. Twice.

Derby were 3-1 down with ten minute to go. We won 5-3 after extra time. As a result of this cautionary tale, the only game I've left early was a miserable reserves game against Preston: 3-0 down at half-time, middle of December, tipping it down, attendance probably only in double figures. Final score was 3-1 so even if I did miss our goal I can't say I particularly regret it.

As the game entered the final minute we finally carved out a chance and someone (probably Paul Stewart) blew it and I decided that enough was enough.<br> It was my first season of driving to matches and therefore the first time things like getting the car out of Stanley Park had ever occurred to me so, as the game went into injury-time, I made my way out. Within literally two seconds of me being outside, a huge roar went up and we had equalised. <br>Before I'd got to the car, another roar went up and we'd snatched an undeserved 2-1 win.

  "<p>He is known for the violent retribution he administers to his enemies, thinking nothing of shooting, stabbing or electrocuting them as he hands out justice on behalf of Queen and country, before uttering a dry quip over their corpses. So you might imagine that James Bond's approach to forgiveness does not have much in common with the Catholic Church.</p> <p>But the Vatican's daily newspaper has overlooked such niceties and given delirious coverage to Skyfall, the latest Bond film, claiming it shows a new, introspective side of the British agent while thankfully cramming in the usual dose of exotic locations and \"extremely beautiful Bond girls\".</p> <p>L'Osservatore Romano has tried recently to move with the times, praising cult films such as the Blues Brothers, lauding Bob Dylan and publishing a women's supplement, ever since the editor, Gian Maria Vian, was told by the pope in 2007 to liven up the 151-year-old daily.</p> <p>But its Skyfall review takes things to new limits for the newspaper, which ran it in Wednesday's edition alongside coverage of the 500th anniversary of the Sistine Chapel, the appointment of new bishops in Peru and the Philippines, and the welcome news that catholic numbers are rising in Ireland.</p> <p>\"To celebrate 50 years of the world's most famous secret agent \u2013 which even the Queen paid homage to at the Olympics \u2013 we needed a film that rose to the occasion,\" said the paper in its review, one of five articles that it devoted to Bond.</p> <p>\"Skyfall does not disappoint. The 23rd Bond film is one of the best in the longest cinematic story of all time,\" it states, adding the film \"does not lack any of the classic ingredients which have made James Bond a legend \u2013 the title credits song, adrenalin pumping action, amazing hyper-realistic chases, exotic locations, extremely beautiful Bond girls, the usual super villain and the essential vodka martini.\"</p> <p>For the bishops, priests and cardinals itching to catch Skyfall, the paper gives a breathless breakdown of the plot, admiring the generational clash that \"is the key to the film\".</p> <p>Daniel Craig, who claimed in Casino Royale that he preferred having sex with married women, is deemed to be \"ever more convincing\", in his latest appearance, while Judy Dench is \"perfect\" as M.</p> <p>Javier Bardem, is described as terrific, \"up there with Goldfinger, Dr No and Rosa Klebb\", although no mention is given to the homoerotic feel he gives his character.</p> <p>Bond himself is less clich\u00e9d, \"less attracted to the pleasures of life, darker and more introspective, less invulnerable physically and psychologically and because of this more human, even able to be moved and to cry \u2013 in a word, more real.\"</p> <p>Summing up, the paper declares: \"Nothing will ever be the same again on the big screen for James Bond.\"</p> <p>A background piece on Ian Fleming follows, with L'Osservatore Romano's extensive coverage wrapping up with a focus on Bond soundtracks, heaping praise on Monty Norman's Bond theme.</p> <p>And in a eulogy eloquent enough to make any priest sob into his bible, it praises the \"two minutes of music played during the legendary gun-barrel sequence which evokes a world of impeccable dinner jackets, cocktails, casinos, luxury villas, femme fatales and powerful cars.\"</p>",
  "<h2>RADIO DAYS</h2> <p>First, a confession: I don't have Sky TV. This, I know, is an all-but-inexcusable position for a man who makes a living writing about cricket. Much as I'd love to claim it was a moral stand against Murdoch, I can't, because it's not. It's just that I'm a cheapskate. It took three years of solid mockery, as well as the shock of seeing how shabby I looked in my brother's wedding photos, to first persuade me to pay for a haircut. Until then, <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/04/02/andy_bull_140x140.jpg\" title=\"\">I used to cut my own hair</a>.</p> <p>Cutting your own hair is, quite clearly, a false economy. When you start it is a curse that you can't see the back of your own head, but when you finish it's a blessing. Eschewing Sky, on the other hand, has definite benefits. For a start you'll be spared the guilt of being sofa-bound during the little good weather we get in a British summer, and can avoid that queasy feeling you get when you draw the curtains to shut out the sun because of the glare on the screen. And for a second, it means that you can listen to Test Match Special.</p> <p>Or at least you could. But now the Board of Control for Cricket in India is demanding the BBC cough up another \u00a350,000 on top of the fees they have already paid to fund broadcasting facilities at the Test grounds being used in the upcoming series. Sky were also asked to pay, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/25/bbc-sky-cricket-rights-india\" title=\"\">10 times that amount</a>, to pay for an \"additional studio and control room\" with \"air conditioning and power back-up\".</p> <p>Sky have decided to stick their commentary team in a studio in London and have them work off the television feed provided by the Indian broadcasters. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/29/bbc-test-match-special-india-deal\" title=\"\">But the BBC are loath to do this</a>. They are, reports suggest, anxious to differentiate themselves from the online commentary provided by Test Match Sofa, which also works off the TV. Test Match Sofa is, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/jul/31/test-match-sofa-review\" title=\"\">I'm told</a>, quite good, and I know a few people who who espouse its merits with the zeal of recent converts. But I'm stuck in my ways, an unashamed Test Match Special fan.</p> <p>I'd like to imagine it is elegantly recherche to declare a preference for TMS over TV. But when you're <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-2225048/Test-Match-Special-held-ransom-Indians-Dont-picking-dear-old-thing.html\" title=\"\">standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Michael Henderson</a> in the Daily Mail, you're probably being fogeyish rather than fancy, a little like a teenager who declares a predilection for tweeds over jeans. But there it is. I'm a TMS addict. Jon Agnew, Vic Marks, Michael Vaughan, Phil Tufnell, Simon Mann, and yes, even Geoff Boycott and Henry Blofeld, are my constant companions. Although now I type out that list of names it strikes me how irritating I find a few of them. That, in an odd way, is part of the programme's charm.</p> <p>In the early days of broadcasting, the longueurs of the game meant many doubted it would work on the radio. \"Cricket, being essentially a leisurely game, lacks the dash and wealth of incident necessary to sustain the listener's interest,\" wrote a correspondent in this very paper back in 1927. It turned out, of course, that it was exactly this quality that made Test Match Special so successful, allowing time for conversation to stray away from the simple reporting of the score and descriptions of the batting and bowling.</p> <p>Listen long enough, and you come to think fondly of Boycott's harangues and Agnew's innumerable grumbles. As excellent as some of Sky's commentary team are, listen to too much TV sports coverage and your brains, belaboured by a ceaseless series of platitudes, will begin to run out of your ears. And yet I'll happily take TMS with me everywhere, seven hours a day, five days in a row, from the bathtub to the back garden, the pub, the park, and the car. I used to have a portable pocket-sized long wave radio for just that purpose.</p> <p>Radio provokes particular nostalgia. Woody Allen made <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCb6-Nz0Nkg\" title=\"\">an entire film about exactly that</a>. \"The whole country was tied together by radio.\" Allen wrote. \"Radio had a tremendous hold on the nation. One couldn't wait to get up in the morning and be sick so you didn't have to go to school and you could stay home and just listen to the radio all day long.\" In cricket too, you'll find that many people's first memories of following the game come from Test Match Special broadcasts.</p> <p>Most fans have cherished memories of TMS, but very few recall classic moments of TV commentary. It might be Agnew stifling his giggles as Brian Johnson talked about Ian Botham \"failing to get his leg over\", or John Arlott describing a stroke by Clive Lloyd as being like \"a man knocking a thistle top off with a walking stick\", or <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/geoff-boycott-tells-mervyn-king-143220\" title=\"\">Boycott leaving a note in the press box admonishing Mervyn King</a>, governor of the Bank of England, who was a guest in the tea break.</p> <p>Desperation is the mother of invention. So here is a suggestion as to how to keep TMS on the air without resorting to cribbing from TV. In the very earliest days of broadcasts from Australia the commentary team would sit on the other side of the world and wait for written reports of the play to come in by cable after each over. This was how the Australian commentator Alan McGilvray started out. His job, he explains in his autobiography, was to decode the cable and, using his imagination, render it into something more suitable for broadcast \u2013 \"Fleetwood Hammond full firstly two Hassett\" might become \"In comes Fleetwood-Smith to bowl at Hammond, and Hammond comes down the wicket and takes it on the full and drives it beautifully past Hassett, who moves around the ball and fields it beautifully, but he can't stop the batsmen coming back for a second.\"</p> <p>There were, inevitably, some problems with this method. \"If the cables dried up we would have to slip in a few balls to mark time, ad-libbing a bit of 'he pats it back to the bowler' stuff,\" McGilvray remembered. \"And we filled the gaps with some of the most horrendous discussion \u2026 We would argue a point hammer and tongs, completely oblivious to the fact neither of us really knew what was going on.\" Even TMS's ardent fans might pause to wonder just how different this all was from what the BBC does today.</p> <p>Then, of course, McGilvray had to replicate the background noise of the ground. This would be done by a sound-effects man, who had a series of recordings to use for each incident: loud cheers, polite applause, disgruntled murmurs. Except for the sound of bat on ball itself. That was provided by the commentator, who was armed with a pencil and a wooden block. \"A cracking hook was signalled by sharp bang, a stroke for one would herald a more gentle tap.\"</p> <p>This would save the BBC an awful lot in expenses, and be worth it, if for no other reason than to allow us all to hear the disgust in Boycott's voice as he was handed his HB pencil and told to get tapping.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/2010/mar/30/1\" title=\"\"><strong>This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

  "<p>Poland's supreme court has issued a landmark judgment against a heavy metal musician who tore up a Bible at a gig in 2007. Although the judges conceded that Adam Darski, AKA Nergal, did not intend to offend his audience, they ruled that he could still have \"offended religious feelings\", violating Polish law. If found guilty, the singer could face up to two years in prison.</p> <p>Darski had released eight albums with his band, Behemoth, by the time of their notorious performance in Gdynia on 13 September 2007. Appearing in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrvv0HRKgqg\" title=\"\">full costume and makeup</a>, Darski tore up a Bible and described the Catholic church as \"the most murderous cult on the planet\".</p> <p>\"We'd been doing that for two years on tour before it happened in Poland,\" Behemoth bassist Tomasz Wr\u00f3blewski told Decibel magazine (via <a href=\"http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=181537\" title=\"\">Blabbermouth</a>). \"We [were] not offending any particular person. We [were] just offending the religion that we've been raised in.\"</p> <p>Despite this intention, Darski was pursued by Polish courts for having offended Catholic fans. After being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/18/polish-death-metal-singer-cleared\" title=\"\">cleared by judges in 2010 and 2011</a>, the singer/guitarist is again on trial. Officials in Gdansk asked the supreme court how Darski could be \"offending religious feelings\" if most of Behemoth's fans expected theatrical sacrilege?</p> <p>\"The crime of offending religious sensibilities is committed not only by he who intends to carry it out, but also by he who is aware that his actions may lead to offence being taken,\" the court said. Prosecutors have been permitted to pursue with the criminal trial.</p> <p>\"One should respect the court's verdict,\" <a href=\"http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/116879,Polands-Supreme-Court-paves-way-for-rock-star-to-be-sentenced-over-bibletearing\" title=\"\">Darski told journalists</a>. But the Catholic church is also \"immature\", he said, \"trying to gag people \u2026 [and] freedom of speech\". Speaking to <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/court-rules-against-polish-rocker-tore-bible-214120197.html\" title=\"\">Reuters</a>, Darski's lawyer said they would continue to oppose the charges: \"We are still arguing that we were dealing with art, which allows more critical and radical statements,\" Jacek Potulski explained.</p> <p>Darski is currently a judge on the TV singing competition The Voice of Poland. Behemoth's most recent LP, Evangelion, was released in 2009. It reached No 2 in Poland.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2012.

  "<p>Whilst the ever ubiquitous tablets, smart phones and connected TVs provide continued variety and choice for audiences on how and when they consume content; this fragmentation across platforms is a challenge for publishers, advertisers and rights holders. From trying to reach target audiences, planning and optimising campaigns across multiple platforms, to creating engaging content appropriate for multiple devices, the way we consume media is changing. Charlie Muirhead, the man behind Rightster explains how the questions this new, fragmented landscape raise, are exactly the ones Rightster are looking to answer.</p> <h2>What is Rightster?</h2> <p>Rightster brings together incredible capabilities in one place \u2014 enabling us to provide integrated, content-led solutions to brands \u2014 from co creating original programming with Rightster studios, to accessing a network of publishers and content producers and offering real insight and learnings on the impact of campaigns with our audience insight tools. It's very powerful to be able to support brands and clients from the inception and creation of the idea, to the post-campaign reconciliation and reporting explains Charlie, adding that in addition for advertisers Rightster offers a simple way of buying precisely targeted pre-roll in front of a large audience by demographic, content type, or time of day.</p> <h2>How is media consumption evolving as we live this digital lifestyle?</h2> <p>The arrival of the tablet has been an hugely disruptive force \u2014 it is incredible to think that only a few years ago, people were questioning whether the format and device would work at all. Now, we have a situation where there are increasingly more and more rights available online, and consumers have even more choice over the content they consume, and on which device.\" Through it's unique combination of software and services, Rightster works to help brands, publishers and content owners navigate the complexity and deliver their content and campaigns to the right audiences.</p> <h2>What are the emerging media trends that excite you right now?</h2> <p>Social has changed the way that we share experiences. I think social television and social apps that understand you and can automatically recommend content and relationships that you didn't necessarily have before are thrilling. Rightster also has particular expertise in the facilitation, monetisation and distribution of live content \u2014 having streamed everything from London Fashion Week to the Leveson Inquiry and the Royal Wedding, we do a lot of work in the live space, and it's a remarkable trend. It gives publishers, portals and blogs access to the world's most exciting content, from a football match to a reading of the Budget. Our prediction is that we're going to see the volume of live streams increase on more platforms, but that we'll also see them customised and editorialised to suit those platforms.</p> <h2>What is next in online video?</h2> <p>Online video has gone through many different evolutions already \u2013 I think the trend we see is firstly the quality of the videos going up and up.\" Gone are the days of grainy, buffering videos \"Not long ago, Rightster streamed the Glyndebourne Opera in HD, and the comments we received from all over the world were overwhelmingly positive. People just wanted to share with the Rightster team how amazing it was to sit in their front room with their dressing gowns, slippers and a glass of wine and to experience the opera in HD. Wonderful.</p> <p>Muirhead also predicts the acceleration of Connected TVs 'although they're available, the adoption rate is still very low. Very soon however, I believe we'll see a very big change in how many people want to go direct to a fashion event, or a football league match etc, from the comfort of their living rooms.</p> <p>\"And then last but not least, I think we're going to see a lot innovation around new payment options. Today you have ad-funded content and you have online skippable ads \u2014 but in TV the concept of a skippable ad doesn't really exist. People just skip ads by fast forwarding through them. So I think the monetization models, the option to skip an ad, will change.\" He adds that \"to be able to pay to have no ads is another option that is going to take hold and I am sure there's going to be a lot more subscription models in the digital space doing what Spotify has done for music. I would expect more things like that to appear for online video.</p> <h2>Show me the money </h2> <p>What's your take on the question of mobile and the challenge this presents to advertisers? \"Getting pre roll video advertising on to mobile devices was crucial and now it has become a reality. But where we are going next in terms of location sensitive technology is amazing. Walking down the street and being able to get a much targeted experience of a local promotion from the shop you might be walking by is just an example of what comes next.</p> <p>But in order for mobile to bring revenue for brands and advertisers alike, it's going to be absolutely critical to find the right monetisation models and I think that we're just started working to that direction.</p> <h2>Can we expect all digital and physical media to be biddable and addressable in years to come?</h2> <p>The question of real time bidding and biddable inventory is an interesting one. We see a great interest in advertisers wanting to appear against premium content wherever it will sit. We also see a lot of interest in people being able to bid for an audience's time. We have worked to make sure that all those models can coexist on the same platform.</p> <p>The owned, the earned and the paid. Rightster works in several different ways with its clients \u2014 when you look at the Rightster network and Rightster Studios, there is this one area which is dedicated to owned media. Our services help rights holders to manage their video content whether it's for their own website, YouTube channel, Facebook page or Twitter account. All of those are what we call 'owned media' \u2014 where the rights holders are in control.</p> <p>The second area we deal with is in earned media. We offer an extensive network of publisher relationships, where we can take the video content and distribute it out to the publisher. Add to that a pre-roll ad we're running in front of that content typically enabling a revenue share to be achieved between the publisher and the rights holder.</p> <p>Last but not least, in terms of paid media, over last 3 months we've adapted the Rightster network to be able to support this business model as well. Simply put, paid media can guarantee to content producers that their video is on a certain site and has a certain number of views.</p> <h2>Highlights of 2012?</h2> <p>This has been an amazing year for Rightster, working with huge news organisations like ITN Productions, Sports News Television (SNTV) and the Guardian, sport rights owners like MP &amp; Silva, and even the world of world of viral content as we join forces with Viral Spiral to create original programming around some of the internet's best loved videos. We've also distributed the live streams from Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York for the first time to a network of publishers, and worked with London Fashion Week for the seventh season distributing their catwalk content.</p> <h2>What's next for Rightster?</h2> <p>The three things on Rightster's agenda for the next 12 months are: to expand globally, to grow our partnership program and, of course, to innovate more. We're already operating worldwide but by the end of this year we aim to have offices in 15 cities. What we really want is to take our turnkey solutions globally. At the same time we need to build more relationships with publishers, platforms, technology partners and different advertising partners. And while we're doing this, we'll keep innovating. Our software team is creating some very clever bits of technology and algorithms to optimize tools like Audience Development on You Tube, Search Engine Optimization and building private syndication portals. By making these available to our clients, we give them their own branded environment from which their publisher partners can come and pick up content.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Towards the end of the debate came a fundamental issue; how do public health professionals persuade colleagues that the private sector is not, as one audience member put it, \"the bogeyman knocking at the door every time we enter into partnership\"?</p> <p>...

The rebel Free Syrian Army have been hesitant to enter Christian districts as there is not that much support for them in these areas.</p> <p>In general the Christians districts are in the centre of Aleppo and the FSA still hasn\u2019t reached the centre. </p> <p>Lots of Christians were in the opposition before the outbreak of the revolution. Most of them were members of the Communist party and Syrian pan-Arab parties. Many joined the Damascus declaration movement in 2005 which called for democratic change in Syria.</p> <p>At first Christians in Aleppo were hesitant to join the protests because it was unclear what would happen, and they felt insecure. Others still feel that the Assad government provides stability, security and some form of freedom.</p> <p>Four months ago, the Armenian community formed a security militia in Aleppo that co-operates with the Syrian army. Armenians believe that the revolution is supported by Turkey so they are against it. Others Christians in the city are opposed to this militia.</p> <p>More than 200 Christians activists have been arrested in Aleppo. But most were later released with the help of the influence of pro-regime Christians.</p> <p>Some Christians fighters have joined the FSA brigades, but there is not an exclusive rebel brigade of Christians in Aleppo.</p> <p>I think the revolution has given Christians hope in Syria. Christians have suffered since the Ba'athists came to power. Christians used to own vast lands in Syria, all of them have been confiscated by the regime and nationalised.</p> <p>I think Christians can guarantee their position by taking part in the revolution. They can be one of the sects who form a new regime.</p> <p>I would prefer to protest peacefully, but if we are forced bear arms, I will do so. If the regime stops bombing the cities, the revolution will become peaceful again. I have devoted myself to the revolution and I know I might be killed or detained at any time.</p> <p>There are lot of informants including Christians who report activists to the regime. Many of my friends were threatened if they continue to protest, they were told their mothers or sisters would be raped. I was summoned for interrogation at the political security branch in Aleppo. It was a psychological terror. There were endless questions like 'why are you criticizing the regime? What is upsetting you of the regime?' I was kept for seven hours and then released.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50912b2bb57959e43bca94ea\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T13:44:11.268Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Shia shrine bomb attack</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reuters has more details from activists on the bomb attack on the Shia shrine in southern Damascus. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"The explosion occurred just east of the shrine.

As in Libya, and unlike in Iraq, intervention would enable the rebellion, not be a substitute for it.</p> <p>In military terms, this would be achieved by establishing a 50-mile no-fly zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. No allied aircraft would need to fly in Syrian airspace, as air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles fired from Turkish airspace and territory would have the necessary range to shoot down Syrian bombers or helicopters in the exclusion zone. Allied AWACS radar aircraft, operating well out of range of Syria\u2019s extensive air defences, would provide full real-time information on any regime aircraft approaching the no-fly zone.</p> <p>The zone would include Aleppo, which means the regime\u2019s bombardment of Syria\u2019s largest city would cease. Its fall, along with unimpeded access to logistical support from Turkey, would give the insurgency the upper hand.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former <a href=\"http://www.peacefare.net/?p=11869\">US diplomat Daniel Serwer is sceptical</a>. Writing on his blog Peacefare.net he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Safe areas are target-rich environments that will attract the murderous instincts of the Assad regime. If you want a no-fly zone, it will have to be far wider than 50 miles and enforced with active patrols, as we did in Iraq. That means destruction of Syrian air defenses, and continued willingness to destroy them on a daily basis.</p> <p>Heisbourg is also hoping the Americans will rouse themselves from inaction after the November 6 election. I doubt it. More arms may flow then to the Syrian rebellion, but people in Washington is really worried about empowering more <em>jihadi </em>in ways that we will come to regret. \u201cFast and furious\u201d in the Middle East could be a lot more serious than in Mexico.</p> <p>The best bet for a decent outcome of the Syrian rebellion is a negotiated exit of Bashar al Assad, followed by an internationally supervised transition.</p> </blockquote> <p>Emile Hokayem, senior fellow at IISS, says Heibourg's proposal for limited no fly zone <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/arm-syrian-rebels-to-make-a-political-solution-possible#ixzz2AsTEk5mL%20\">\"is proving too much for risk-averse western and Turkish policymakers\"</a>.</p> <p>And, a paper published by the Brookings Doha Centre last week said there <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2012/10/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh.pdf\">\"few supporters in Nato and Washington for collective efforts to </a><br><a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2012/10/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh.pdf\">establish humanitarian zones and no-fly zones\"[pdf]</a> .

Some 330 buses will deliver the connecting service. A few Metro North and Long Island Railroad services will start today.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Kennedy and Newark Liberty airports reopened with limited service Wednesday morning.</strong> New York's LaGuardia Airport, which suffered far worse damage and where water covered parts of runways, remained closed.

It reads: \u201cMultiple National Guard trucks will be coming through flooded streets, first to evacuate those with true medical emergencies. Keep an eye out, go down to the lowest possible floor, but do not go outside. Signal to get their attention.\u201d</p> <p>More than 20,000 people are trapped in their homes, according to reports, without power for the third day running as many parts of the city remain under several feet of water. Residents are being urged to stay inside for safety reasons as the water has live wires and is contaminated with sewage. More than half the population of 50,000, are without power, according to <a href=\"http://www.hobokenhorse.com/\">a city website</a>.&#xa0;Water is not expected to recede for 24-48 hours.</p> <p>The mayor sent out a call on Twitter asking for local volunteers to report to City Hall at 10am on Wednesday. Two shelters have been set up on Hudson Street, and people are being asked for blankets, pillows and other items to help make the evacuated more comfortable.</p> <p>Hoboken's Facebook page has become a message board for residents and their relatives, desperate for contact with each other as well as for information.

Virgin protested, and said it would take the government to court, the government held firm, and then when McLoughlin took over from Justine Greening as transport secretary in September the whole process was scrapped. McLoughlin laid the blame \"fairly and squarely\" on DfT officials, suspending three of them.</p> <p>McLoughlin is also expected to be asked why he told MPs when he appeared before the committee in September that he was happy with the bidding process, and then scrapped it a few weeks later.</p> <p>On Monday the transport secretary published the initial findings of the report he set up to look into the whole affair, led by Sam Laidlaw. It said the DfT had been \"aware of a lack of transparency\" in an aspect of the franchise process but had decided to continue \"and to accept the risk of a bidder challenge\", the Press Association reports.</p> <p>The Laidlaw report also said the companies bidding for the franchise were not provided with adequate information, the DfT did not follow its own guidance, and the evaluation of the financial robustness of the bids was \"developed late, in a hurry and without proper planning and preparation\".</p> <p>Laidlaw said the DfT had undergone staff reductions and frequent changes of leadership, and organisational changes and the department's structure \"resulted in a lack of clarity around allocation of responsibility\" for the bidding competition. These factors raised \"potentially significant issues about the ability of the DfT effectively to conduct rail franchise competitions\".</p> <p>The government is now in discussions with Virgin about its continuing to run services for up to 14 months until an interim franchise competition is held before a competition for a full franchise.</p> <p>The route is the busiest in the country and runs from London through Birmingham and Manchester to Edinburgh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-90011906-284d-4b81-9b8c-f4f0323fc874\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351691652148/a32e2bbf-a85a-4b29-b7b5-31d1c7cf0682-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A Virgin train passing a First Group train on the west coast mainline.

But we\u2019ve consistently targeted a real terms freeze in the next multi-year EU budget (Multiannual Financial Framework/MFF) because that\u2019s the best deal we can actually deliver for British taxpayers.</p> <p>We can veto this \u2013 and we will if we don\u2019t get a real terms freeze: no deal is better than a bad deal \u2013 but the veto won\u2019t leave us in the best place. If there\u2019s no agreement then ultimately we move to annual budgets, decided by qualified majority voting and jointly with the European Parliament.

But does anyone really believe this is not, as David Cameron said, simply \"rank opportunism\" from Labour, who as a rule have been pro-EU for decades? Miliband's position makes for great tactics - this afternoon's vote will certainly put the government in a difficult position - but as genuine practical policy it's unconvincing.</p> <p>However, Miliband did come out with a new attack line which may get some traction: \"He is weak at home, he is weak abroad - it's John Major all over again.\"</p> <p>Miliband was also on stronger ground regarding Lord Heseltine's growth report, which attacks much government policy. After Miliband read out a Heseltine quote implying that the government had no strategy for growth or wealth creation, Cameron's reply that actually the former DPM thought the coalition was roughly on the right track was almost satirical. And the Davey/Hayes wind farms row meant it was a great day for Miliband to be able to quote Heseltine's specific point about the government not having a coherent energy policy. Cameron had no real answer to that, and looked evasive. </p> <p><strong>Verdict: a draw.</strong></p> <p>PS John Bercow, the Speaker, proved yet again how much of a stickler for the rules he was by telling the PM and other MPs off for breaches of parliamentary etiquette.

Section 3.30 refers to the Govt Chief Whip being responsible for the arrangement of business but gives neither that individual or the Leader of the House any additional power or authority to order business.</p> <p>Business is arranged by agreement through 'Usual Channels' (Govt/Opposition discussions). Changes are either by agreement or on motions to the House. So maybe Strathclyde can't just unilaterally pull stumps on the bill.</p> </blockquote> <p>The background to this is the Lib Dem decision to block the boundary changes - which would favour the Tories - after the Conservatives blocked Lords reform. The Tories are said to accept the boundary changes will now be delayed until 2015, but they are surprised Lib Dems are backing a delay until 2018. Waugh writes: \"I understand the DPM's position is that he meant what he said when he said he would block the boundary changes in retaliation for losing Lords reform.\"</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5090ed4395cb49410b863b96\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T09:20:03.641Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wind farms</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press secretary, now secretary of the pressure group Supporters of Nuclear Energy, has commented on John Hayes's anti-wind farm remarks, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reality is dawning.

  "<p>Sicilian, devoted Catholic and homosexual. This unlikely collection of words defines <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/sicily-gay-governor-rosario-crocetta?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Rosario Crocetta</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2012/10/italian-politics\" title=\"\">newly elected governor of Sicily</a>.</p> <p>But his election, which has come at the expense of Silvio Berlusconi's rightwing People of Freedom party, is not a victory for Italy's gay rights movement.</p> <p>He is one of only two openly gay men to be elected governor in Italy, but Crocetta has never used his sexual orientation to raise awareness of gay rights, or to commit to change Italy's unique status as a western country that does not recognise any kind of same-sex union.</p> <p>On the contrary, Crocetta has been quoted as saying that if he won he would <a href=\"http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/no-sex-if-elected-promises-italian-politician_795070.html\" title=\"\">refrain from sex</a>.</p> <p>In this conservative southern region of Sicily, this is likely to reinforce the idea that being gay and having sex is unacceptable, according to Paola Bonesu, a political communication consultant and co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.panepolitica.it/\" title=\"\">Pane &amp; Politica</a>. \"He is ready to refrain from sexual intercourse in order to distance himself from the stereotypical promiscuous homosexual lifestyle,\" she said.</p> <p>The Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, a centrist party close to the Catholic church, which joined the leftwing Democratic party to form the coalition Crocetta leads, is also likely to limit pro-gay political initiatives in the region. Crocetta's inability to act on social rights will be compounded by the lack of power given to governors under Italian legislation.</p> <p>\"Lacking nationwide legislation, single regions cannot act independently [against] homophobic behaviours and to grant same-sex unions. Isolated initiatives approved in Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria (central and northern Italy) have not positively affected daily lives of gays and lesbians, who still face social and legislative discrimination,\" says gay activist Stefano Bucaioni.</p> <p>Crocetta has often rejected the common perception that southern Italy has a more homophobic attitude than central and northern regions. \"There is a great respect for the individual, making it less homophobic than the north. After leaving prison in England, Oscar Wilde took refuge in Palermo. Seen like this, there is lot people have to learn about the south,\" <a href=\"http://www.linkiesta.it/rosario-crocetta-sicilia\" title=\"\">he said recently</a>.</p> <p>Yet the latest data from Italy's national institute of statistics, Istat, seems to contradict him. In 2011, only 16% of a population sample based in southern Italy defined homosexual relationships as acceptable, against a national average of 27%, 38% in central regions and 30% in northern Italy.</p> <p>Young gay people who come out in southern Italy are more likely to be the victim of acts of aggression (more directed at men than women) or of discrimination in the workplace and are more likely to take their own lives.</p> <p>Since the beginning of his political career in 2003, when he was elected mayor of his hometown of Gela, Crocetta has been able to offset the potential disadvantage of his sexual orientation by not emphasising it in public.</p> <p>The new governor is mostly known to the public for his anti-mafia initiatives and his strong religious beliefs. After he voted on Sunday, Crocetta headed back to Gela for prayers. The Catholic church, of course, still strongly opposes the introduction of gay marriage in Italy.</p> <p>Crocetta shares his religious affiliation with Nichi Vendola, governor of the southern region of Apulia since 2005, and Italy's only other openly gay governor.</p> <p>But unlike Crocetta, Vendola has put gay rights at the top of his political agenda, saying that he would like to marry his partner and adopt children with him, positively impacting on social attitudes towards gay people in the region and nationally. Crocetta, in contrast, said: \"If I win, I will marry Sicily and Sicilian people.\"</p> <p>The hope is now that, having succeeded in something that would have been unbelievable only a few weeks ago, Crocetta will channel his political power to encourage greater respect for gay people, and he will use his personal story to demonstrate that a successful Italian politician can be gay and Catholic at the same time.</p>",

  "<p><strong>\"I was recently digging up the history of many cup tournaments and I found out that in </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979%E2%80%9380_Copa_del_Rey\" title=\"\"><strong>1980 Real Madrid played their reserve squad in the final of the Copa del Rey</strong></a><strong>,\" </strong>wrote Svilen Tomov <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/player-fastest-distance-race\" title=\"\">last week</a>. <strong>\"Is this the only occurrence anywhere, or has it happened more than once?\"</strong></p> <p>Not that we know of, Svilen, but there have been a few close misses. First, though, let's take a look at that remarkable cup run of Castilla CF, Real's reserve team. They began with two-leg wins over Extremadura, Alcorcon (who a couple of years ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/27/real-madrid-alcorcon-copa-del-rey\" title=\"\">embarrassed the full Madrid side</a>), and Racing Santander before taking on the big boys of La Liga.</p> <p>H\u00e9rcules (who finished 15th in the top flight) were beaten first, then Athletic Bilbao (seventh), Real Sociedad (runners-up) and finally Sporting Gij\u00f3n (who came third behind Sociedad and Real) in the semi-finals. In the final the Real first team put the upstarts \u2013 featuring a young Ricardo Gallego, who would go on to win 42 caps for Spain and feature at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, in their ranks \u2013 firmly in their place with a 6-1 hammering.</p> <p>The adventure wasn't over, though. With Real winning the title, Castilla became Spain's entrants in the 1980-81 Cup Winners' Cup, the only reserve side ever to compete in European competition (at least until English sides started fielding theirs in the Uefa Cup). It was a brief but eventful campaign. In the first round they beat a West Ham side including Trevor Brooking <em>et al</em> 3-1 at the Bernab\u00e9u, but violence at the game meant the return leg was played behind closed doors. The Hammers won 3-1 in 90 minutes and the 262 spectators who had somehow crept into Upton Park saw David Cross score twice in extra-time to complete his hat-trick and <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/castilla-ec.html\" title=\"\">send the English side through 6-4 on aggregate</a>. (Footage of the second leg with, oddly, crowd noise seemingly dubbed on top, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1I2HGJXeLI\" title=\"\">can be seen here</a>.)</p> <p>The club closest to matching Real's feat is the Swedish side Orgryte. \"Until 1925, the Swedish championship was decided in a knock-out tournament. In 1897 the reserves of Orgryte IS reached the final for the first time, losing 0-1 to the first team,\" reports <a href=\"http://rsssf.com/\" title=\"\">the ever-excellent rsssf.com</a> promisingly, only to put something of a damper on things by adding: \"This was, however, not much of a feat, as there had been no other entries.\"</p> <p>Ajax's second team were just a penalty shootout away from meeting their first XI in the 2001-02 Dutch Cup final, reports Tom Adams on Twitter. Having beaten De Graafschap in the third round, Twente in round four and Telstar in the quarter-finals, Ajax II's cup run came to an end against Utrecht in the last four, 7-6 on penalties after a 2-2 draw. (It was quite a young side that Ajax II had back then: Maarten Stekelenburg, Petri Pasanen, Abubakari Yakubu, Jelle van Damme, Steven Pienaar, Nigel de Jong, Wesley Sneijder, Michael Krohn-Dehli, Cedric van der Gun, Jason Culina, Johnny Heitinga and Tim de Cler all featured at various points in the season).</p> <p>Austria Vienna had a very similar tale to Ajax in the 2008-09 Austrian Cup, with the reserve team beaten by FC Admira in the semi-finals while the first XI went on to win the tournament.</p> <p>Also close were Hertha Berlin in the 1992-93 German Cup, but it was the first team that, ahem, let the side down. Hertha were dumped out by Bayer Leverkusen in the round of 16, but their reserve team battled all the way to the final, where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_DFB_Cup_Final#Final\" title=\"\">they were also beaten by Bayer</a>. And also deserving of a mention are Sparta Prague B, who reached the Czech Cup semi-finals in 1970-71 having beaten the Sparta first team in the quarter-finals.</p> <p><em>More on some of the football world's best reserve sides can be found </em><a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/reserves.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h2>FOOTBALL'S GREATEST MARATHON RUNNERS (2)</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/player-fastest-distance-race\" title=\"\"><strong>Last week</strong></a><strong> we thought that the former Leicester City player Muzzy Izzet might be the tidiest footballing marathon runner, finishing the 2011 London Marathon in 3 hours and 22 minutes.</strong></p> <p>Not so, says Martin Axon, who sent in a link to the story of the former Exeter City utility man Barry McConnell's 2011 charity run from John O'Groats to Lands End, in which it was revealed that his best marathon finish was a spritely two hours and 58 minutes. Last summer Truro, where McConnell had been playing since 2008, gave him time off from pre-season training to complete the length-of-Britain challenge in aid of the Adam Stansfield Foundation.</p> <p>\"I don't really think that the pre-season running sessions that I would be doing quite compare to this,\" said Barry, who was proved horribly right by a knee injury that forced him to abandon the run after 126 miles, somewhere near Inverness. \"I was forced to stop, I had terrible pain in my right knee,\" he explained, having run 30 miles on the swollen joint the day before. \"I feel disappointed and devastated that I couldn't continue.\" There was some suggestion that he might try again further down the line, but we've not been able to find anything. Give us a bell if you know otherwise.</p> <p>\"Former Spanish internationals Luis Enrique (ex Sporting Gijon, Real Madrid and Barcelona), Emilio Amavisca (Racing Santander, Real Madrid) and Iv\u00e1n Helguera (Racing Santander, Real Madrid) all deserve a mention,\" reckons Dermot, who cites numerous marathons and Ironman competitions. Indeed, he <a href=\"http://miticosdelbalompie.blogspot.com.es/2009/02/futbolistas-en-otros-deportes-luis.html\" title=\"\">included this link</a>, which describes the lengths Luis Enrique went to (geddit?) in his post-football career. Having run his first marathon in three hours and 14 minutes, he dipped under the three-hour mark a couple of years later by completing the Florence marathon in 2 hours, 57 minutes and 58 seconds. He completed the Marathon des Sables (151 miles across the desert) in 2008 and is scheduled to take part in the Cape Epic (a 400-odd mile, two-person mountain bike race) early next year. We've pulled our hamstrings just thinking about it.</p> <p>\"As you might not recall, the Danish international striker Miklos Molnar decided to hang up his football boots at the age of 30, in favour of some running shoes, to start a new career as an Ironman competitor.\" This from Martin Mathiasen. \"He ran the 2005 Copenhagen Marathon in 2:59:20, although I suppose he has the distinct advantage of actually training for these things, compared to the other footballers.\" True enough, though the former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia could do no better than three hours and 56 minutes in last year's Helsinki marathon, as Mikko Knuuttila emailed in to tell us.</p> <p>There's half-marathon news, too! Ian Rogers dug out his old copies of Shoot! to find reference in Kevin Keegan's columns to an appearance at the first Great North Run in 1981. According to the race's Hall of Fame, Keegan suffered a wardrobe malfunction about six miles in. \"Eleven year old Eddie Hope and his brother had been waiting on the roadside to see their idol, and he ended up swapping his running shoes with his hero, as the ones [Keegan] was wearing gave him blisters. Despite the trainers, Kevin finished in an impressive one hour and 26 minutes.\" Which makes him a good 23 minutes faster than Paolo Di Canio.</p> <p>Finally, we also received an email from TEN Sports' very own Joe Morrison, explaining that his studio colleague and pundit Trevor Sinclair ran the London marathon in 3 hours and 33 minutes earlier this year. \"So he tells me,\" notes Joe.</p> <h2>DELIBERATE OWN GOALS</h2> <p><strong>Last week we looked at the players to have scored deliberate own goals (</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/player-fastest-distance-race\" title=\"\"><strong>featuring 149 in one match</strong></a><strong>) in protest against their club, their manager or the referee. And though this email doesn't exactly fit the bill, it's an enjoyable yarn nevertheless:</strong></p> <p>\"Austria's greatest football coach ever, Ernst Happel, loved to score own goals during his playing days against his team-mate and close friend Walter Zeman,\" writes J\u00f6rg Michner. \"Both played for Rapid Vienna and the Austrian national team, Happel being a defender and Zeman obviously a goalkeeper. When Rapid was crushing the opposition, as they often did in the 1940s and 50s, Happel used to get bored at the back and occasionally took the ball, scored an own goal and taunted Zeman: \"Lucky for you I didn't hit you in the head or else you'd be dead,\" he would shout in broad Viennese at his keeper. When Austria was preparing for the 1954 World Cup against a local selection in Innsbruck, at the scoreline of 14-0 a bored Happel put the ball in his own net from 20 metres out.\"</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"There's a story doing the rounds at my local that Blackpool once resorted to using a flamethrower to thaw out their frozen pitch,\" </strong>wrote Bill Winkles back in 2007. <strong>\"Would I be right to think it's total guff?\"</strong></p> <p>Well Bill, it's not quite true, but it is closer to reality than you might imagine. The winter of 1962-63 was extremely harsh, and Blackpool suffered more than most as their pitch completely froze over to the point where they couldn't play a single home game between 15 December and 2 March. Some players even took to ice skating on the pitch, as revealed by the following gem, dug out of the West Lancashire Evening Gazette's archives by Seasiders historian Gerry Wolstenholme:</p> <p>\"At Bloomfield Road Jimmy Armfield and Tony Waiters ice skated on the pitch on 8 January 1963 and two days later they were joined by Barrie Martin, 'Mandy' Hill and two other players. On 29 January 1963 Blackpool used a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_harrow\" title=\"\">disc harrow</a> to try to get the game against West Ham United played on 2 February 1963 but that too proved ineffective and on 30 January 1963 the players swept a heavy fall of snow from the pitch in a vain hope that it would be clear underneath, but the ice \u2013 one to four inches thick \u2013 was 'as formidable as ever'.\"</p> <p>But it was actually Norwich who attempted, unsuccessfully, to defrost their playing surface with fire. Their scheduled FA Cup third-round tie at home to Blackpool had been postponed 11 times, and, as the same piece of archive reveals, they were willing to try just about anything by the end. \"In an attempt to get the game played, the Carrow Road pitch was treated with flamethrowers on 22 January 1963 as, according to a Norwich spokesman, 'a last desperate effort'. However they 'served no purpose whatsoever' for 'as fast as the ice melted it froze again'. An icebreaker was also used but it too proved ineffective.\"</p> <p><em>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\" title=\"\"><em>the Knowledge archive</em></a></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\"In a game that was remarkable for a number of reasons, Theo Walcott was credited with goals on 45, 90 and 120 minutes for Arsenal against Reading in the League Cup, surely the only hat-trick ever scored entirely outside regulation time (including the extra half-hour - the last goal was 120+0:02),\" writes Joe Ludlam. \"Has anyone else matched or even come close to such a statistical freak?\"</p> <p>\"Sunday's game between River Plate and Boca Juniors was delayed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2012/oct/29/boca-juniors-river-plate-superclasico-pictures#/?picture=398509856&amp;index=4\" title=\"\">River fans holding aloft a giant inflatable pig wearing a Boca shirt</a>,\" writes Kevin Downey. \"Is this the first time a match has ever been delayed by an inflatable?\"</p> <p>\"Have there been any instances of spouses taking medals and similar football honours as part of the proceeds from a relationship with a footballer?\" asks Prashant Maharaj. \"If so, who is the most decorated former partner of a footballer?\"</p> <p>\"It seems like Russian clubs have a lot of Brazilians in their squads,\" begins Kai Helge Aalhus. \"In the match between Shakhtar Donetsk and Chelsea I counted 10 Brazilian-born players among the 36 players on the pitch and bench.

Has any other team had a bigger aversion to playing on a school night?\"</p> <p>\"Last week Carlos Arias of the Bolivian club Oriente Petrolero <a href=\"http://www.ole.com.ar/fuera-de-juego/tres-penales-tres_0_796720572.html\" title=\"\">saved three penalty kicks in a game against Universitario</a>,\" begins Tim Dockery. \"While impressive, he is hardly the only goalkeeper to save three penalty kicks in the same game. These penalty kicks, however, all derived from the same penalty. Arias blocked Universitario's first attempt to score, but he was deemed to have prematurely left his line, and the penalty was retaken. The second attempt was also saved but retaken for the same reason. Finally, his third save on Universitario's third try was deemed valid.

  "<p>The UK can be proud of its role in developing the European Convention on Human Rights into the foremost regional human rights system. A large part of that success is attributable to states accepting their obligation to implement European court of human rights (ECtHR) judgments against them. It was by voluntarily accepting the jurisdiction of the court, as the UK did in 1966, that states provided oxygen to a burgeoning \"Europe of rights\". However, that system remains frail; vulnerable to being undermined by the withdrawal of states' commitment to the court.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/24/prisoner-votes-row-government-respect\" title=\"\">current dispute over prisoner voting</a> between the Strasbourg court (which says an absolute ban on prisoners voting violates the Convention) and the UK (which is committed to an absolute ban) vividly illustrates that frailty. Among the proposals for reform this dispute has elicited is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/29/prisoner-votes-strasbourg-national-independence\" title=\"\">Michael Pinto-Duschinsky's suggestion</a> of a treaty amendment that would \"allow national parliaments to override Strasbourg decisions on general matters of policy\". This suggestion ought to be resisted.</p> <p>Pinto-Duschinsky claims that such an override would be rare and that states would generally comply with ECtHR rulings, but does not deal with the real possibility that popularism might dictate policy. Implementing Strasbourg rulings requiring improved rights protection for marginalised groups such immigrants, or suspected terrorists, or sex offenders may make a government unpopular.</p> <p>Can we really expect parliament to resist calls for an override where the rights improvement is unpopular? And if we cannot, are we prepared to consign rights-protection to populist campaigns and political whim?</p> <p>What of states that have truly poor human rights records? One imagines that such an amendment would be music to their ears. An amendment would not just be for the UK; it would be for all 47 member states in each of which popularism and tolerance of systematic rights violations could masquerade as \"sovereignty\" by means of an override. This suggests that some kind of oversight would be required if the amendment were not to undo the Convention system completely.</p> <p>This would inevitably involve a European entity (maybe the human rights court itself?) deciding on the validity of parliamentary overrides. It should be obvious that any such oversight system would exacerbate tensions between Strasbourg and national legislatures, rather than calm them. The proposed amendment offers no solution.</p> <p>Contrary to some opinion, parliamentary will is not ignored by the court. National institutions are afforded discretion in implementing the Convention and the judgment of national parliaments is considered. Discretion cannot be absolute; if it were there would be little indeed to the rule of law. The fact that the ECtHR reached a decision that did not align with parliament's perspective does not mean it ignored parliament; it simply means that it was convinced by a stronger argument. Deciding disputes based on the relative weight of competing arguments is what courts are supposed to do; one cannot expect to \"win\" all of the time.</p> <p>When the UK signed up to the jurisdiction of the court, it agreed to be bound by any decisions handed down against it. The then lord chancellor famously advised that such decisions would be rare, if indeed they happened at all. That this has turned out not to be the case does not mean the ECtHR is disrespectful of parliament; rather it means international law is working.</p> <p>There is only one rights-enhancing way of preventing ECtHR judgments that rub up against parliamentary will: designing and implementing law and policy that complies with the Convention in the first place.</p>",
  "<h2>Partnering with the public</h2> <p>\u2022 When public health professionals consider potential partners for educational campaigns to improve health outcomes, they often forget to consider the public as a key partner. Health professionals need to partner with the public, rather than considering it a passive audience of educational campaigns</p> <p>\u2022 Who does the public trust in the health care system? The public does not trust politicians and has mixed faith in local authorities but does trust the BBC and NHS brands</p> <p>\u2022 Patients can be empowered by increased health literacy and by access to their own health records</p> <h2>Partnering with communities</h2> <p>\u2022 Community health champions are a potential target for partnerships, as they have the trust of the community and a more detailed knowledge of its needs</p> <p>\u2022 It is important for public health professionals to partner with the social service sector</p> <p>\u2022 There is a need for creative communication to address hard-to-reach groups</p> <p>\u2022 Public health communications are most effective when they engage people through positive messages. Appealing to a sense of aspiration and achievement can be more effective than messages of fear or punishment. Examples include boot camps and football clubs with \"fit fan\" programmes</p> <h2>New statutory duties to reduce health inequalities </h2> <p>\u2022 It is not yet clear how local authorities will be affected by the new statutory duty to reduce health inequalities</p> <p>\u2022 The modern labour market sorts people early in life (for example, through schools) into differential groups and lifestyles, and these groups experience different patterns of disease</p> <p>\u2022 Commercial pressures in diseases of excess (for example, alcoholism and obesity) impinge most on those with the fewest options</p> <p>\u2022 The science on how to reduce inequalities is in a very primitive state \u2013 it will be challenging for the government to reduce inequalities</p> <h2>Information technology</h2> <p>\u2022 After the leaders and strategy are in place, partnerships need to effectively operationalise. This depends on strong information technology</p> <p>\u2022 Patient data linkage needs to be stronger. Often, physicians' desire for professional control prevents them from having conversations with other actors (e.g. pharmacies) about actions they have taken</p> <p>\u2022 NHS has the ambition of doing big things with big data, but information remains one of the most under-used resources in the NHS</p> <h2>Shift to Public Health England and the new NHS structure</h2> <p>\u2022 In transitioning to the new NHS in April, it will be challenging to maintain the momentum of existing organisations and partnerships as both personnel and structures change</p> <p>\u2022 There is concern about who will be represented in the CCGs and local authorities \u2013 not everyone is at the table</p> <p>\u2022 How can the voluntary sector make sure their voice is still heard in the transition? There is a problem of access to major players and numbers because of the desire to keep money within statutory services</p> <p>\u2022 Local authorities have a number of competing concerns; when addressing public health issues becomes their responsibility, this objective may conflict with others. For example, local authorities may be more interested in enhancing the economy by opening local bars than in addressing the health problems resulting from abuse of alcohol</p> <p>\u2022 There will be lots of on-the-job learning. The inevitable leadership and power struggle create a risk of 'announcement-itis', in which a constant stream of announcements are made without real follow-through</p> <p>\u2022 Systemic change is not necessarily an opportunity to create new solutions and partnerships because there will be a substantial effort to re-establish old structures and prevent things from failing. Opportunities may increase after some time</p>",
  "<p>Black people experiencing mental ill health continue to be at a higher risk of detention in hospital and are over-represented in forensic services and prison.</p> <p>Despite investment in community services for treating mental illness, detentions for black people <a href=\"http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/mental-health/nhs-specialist-mental-health-services\" title=\"\">almost doubled</a> from 2,731 (10.7 per cent of all those detained) in 2005-06 to 4,624 in 2009-10.</p> <p>These findings suggest a culture of care where detention for black communities is acceptable and expected. All of which makes the <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Care Quality Commission</a>'s decision to <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/media/care-quality-commission-looks-ahead-last-count-me-census-published\" title=\"\">stop collecting data</a> under the <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/organisations-we-regulate/mental-health-services/count-me-2010-census\" title=\"\">Count Me In Census</a>, due to a lack of improvement in outcomes, all the more incredible.</p> <p>It is also surprising and worrying that the <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm\" title=\"\">Department of Health</a> has remained silent and not prioritised more research and services to both understand and tackle the problem.</p> <p>This is why the role of the voluntary sector is so crucial. The sector has made progress in its work with those most at risk of detention by proposing alternative models of care.</p> <p>These creative solutions have emerged through necessity, are rarely evaluated using randomised trial designs and offer hope and inspiration to service users facing systems of care that they either fear or find unattractive.</p> <p>Five years ago, I set up the <a href=\"http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/psychiatry/epic/\" title=\"\">Enhancing Pathways into Care</a> (Epic) project in four NHS trusts (Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham and Easington) to improve the entry into and exit from care by collaborating with the voluntary sector. The project was part of the Department of Health's former <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4100773\" title=\"\">delivering race equality programme</a>.</p> <p>In Sheffield, the project made an impact on voluntary sector and crisis services. This meant that the number of bed days for African-Caribbean patients dropped dramatically from 350 to 31 between 2005 and 2010.</p> <p>Even if the voluntary sector is not directly involved in caring for inpatients, under the new commissioning arrangements it will play an increasing part in discharge planning, advocacy, after-care and housing.</p> <p>However, there is a stumbling block. Many staff in the voluntary sector are unfamiliar with the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/12/contents\" title=\"\">Mental Health Act 2007</a>, and the protections and rights it offers.</p> <p>This month the <a href=\"http://www.mhpf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mental Health Providers Forum</a>, an umbrella body of 50 voluntary sector service providers responsible for an \u00a3800m spend on care services, launched much needed guidance on the act to deal with this challenge.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.mhpf.org.uk/programmes-and-projects/mental-health-legislation-resource\" title=\"\">mental health legislation resource</a> for health and social care practitioners sets clear standards on how to use the Act in the promotion of good mental health care. It also provides case studies, including ones that cover race and equality concerns.</p> <p>I have gone a step further by helping to develop a new <a href=\"http://www.law.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/llm/modules/42950.html\" title=\"\">MSc in mental health and law</a> at <a href=\"http://www.qmul.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Queen Mary, University London</a>. It will be jointly delivered by the <a href=\"http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine</a> and the university's law department, and will be open to applications from January 2013.</p> <p>There are also a series of workshops and continuing professional development events on homicide and mental illness being run by the <a href=\"http://www.culturalconsultation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Cultural Consultation Service</a>, which will use the mental health legislation resource to promote a better understanding and application of mental health law.</p> <p>The changes in the commissioning arrangements and the reorganisation of health and social care means that greater attention will be paid to the prevention of mental health problems, mental health promotion and, of course, legislation.</p> <p>There is an incredible opportunity to improve the quality of personalised care that mental health service users receive through the voluntary sector. Services that are flexible, more closely linked to community agencies and grounded in less institutionalised approaches to mental health care.</p> <p>In this new climate of provision that is cost effective, more humane and less institutionalised, we are on the brink of a potential revolution in care commissioning and provision, particularly for black communities. That is if the voluntary sector steps up to the challenge.</p> <p><em>Kamaldeep Bhui is professor of cultural psychiatry and epidemiology at Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, and director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.culturalconsultation.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>cultural consultation service</em></a><em>, which are both based at </em><a href=\"http://www.qmul.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Queen Mary, University of London</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

  "<p>How much do we know about what is happening in housing? On the face of it, not as much as we used to.</p> <p>Prior to the abolition of the Tenant Services Authority (TSA) in March 2012, landlords in England submitted reams of data to the TSA and other government agencies. But, under the coalition government's system of light-touch regulation, they are no longer required to tell anyone but their tenants how effectively they carry out repairs or levels of overall satisfaction with their service. If they neglect to provide this information to tenants, it is unclear whether anyone would ever find out.</p> <p>Roger Jarman, former head of housing at the Audit Commission, is concerned the absence of standardised data means tenants can no longer compare their landlord's performance with that of other providers. \"Taking away the need for organisations to collect customer satisfaction statistics is retrograde,\" he says. \"An excessive amount of data was collected [before], but getting rid of some performance data is not helpful for users.\"</p> <p>In a study for the Housing Quality Network, Jarman shows that, while data demands have dropped across the sector, local authorities and housing associations are affected differently. Later this year, the government is due to publish the first English Local Authority Statistics on Housing. This replaces three previous sets of data and covers areas such as stock condition, vacancies and rents but provides less information on capital spending and choice-based lettings.</p> <p>Housing association data is still collected by the Homes and Communities Agency for its statistical data return (SDR), covering the number of homes owned by providers, rents, and progress towards the decent homes standard. However, the HCA's regulation committee (which took over part of the TSA's remit) is more interested in financial than consumer affairs and does not concern itself with day-to-day detail unless it receives specific complaints from tenants claiming to have suffered \"serious detriment\".</p> <p>Michael Gelling, chair of the Tenant and Residents Organisations of England (Taroe) says it is vital that tenants scrutinise their landlord effectively and boards are willing to press for information \u2013 even for information that landlords are not required to submit elsewhere.</p> <p>All providers must produce an annual report for tenants but, according to Gelling, the quality varies significantly and most landlords only do what is required by law. \"It's always a minority that go the extra mile,\" he says.</p> <p>Nick Atkin, chief executive of Halton Housing Trust, agrees that associations are submitting less performance data but says they need evidence of how they are operating in case it is requested by the HCA. \"The regulatory process is based on evidence rather than judgments,\" he says.</p> <p>Ironically, the reduction in regulation coincides with a need for landlords to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/oct/24/housing-providers-tenant-data-tesco-clubcard\" title=\"\">gather more information on tenants</a> so that, among other things, they can monitor the impact of welfare changes. This may entail checking if tenants have bank accounts for the receipt of benefits by direct debit, or visiting residents claiming jobseeker's allowance to see whether they are actively seeking work.</p> <p>At the same time, customer satisfaction surveys have moved away from a ticked-box approach to inquiring whether tenants would recommend their landlord to a family member or friend. \"We are much more sophisticated in the way we gather data and use it to inform our business model,\" Atkin claims.</p> <p>Julian Ashby, chair of the HCA's regulation committee, admits his organisation has no power to request data on repairs or customer satisfaction. Nine investigations have been started following complaints about providers by tenants, but, to date, no cases of \"serious detriment\" have been proved. \"My understanding is that an overwhelming majority of the large providers collect a lot of data about their performance,\" says Ashby. \"You can't manage an organisation effectively if you don't collect data.\"</p> <p>The government is now leaving it to managers and boards to decide whether they collect data and how they use it. Will Perry, business development director at the benchmarking group Housemark, doubts the housing sector is suffering from a data shortage but says it is harder than ever to get a full picture on landlords. \"It's not that people are collecting less information, it's the consistency of the format,\" he explains.</p> <p>The new system is welcomed by Tony Stacey, chief executive of South Yorkshire Housing Association, who also doubts whether any responsible landlord would stop collecting data on repairs or customer satisfaction just because the government is no longer looking over their shoulder. \"It's not reduced the burden dramatically but means that we can really concentrate on our relationship with tenants.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for analysis, best practice and the latest job vacancies</strong></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.briansewell.co.uk/home.html\" title=\"\">Brian Sewell</a> is an odd cove \u2013 the odd cove's odd cove, indeed. His fellow art critics and other worthies \u2013 an innocuous lot \u2013 once signed a general letter demanding that he be sacked from <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/biography/brian-sewell\" title=\"\">his job on the Evening Standard</a>, thereby assuring that he would be secure in perpetuity. Gay people of a younger generation tend to roll their eyes at the mention of his name, since he carried on the general principle that your boyfriend had to be referred to as \"my cousin, several times removed, from Sicily\" decades after it had stopped being necessary. He is, of course, regularly referred to as a \"national treasure\", as is anyone who reads out the voiceover for television adverts more than three times a year.</p> <p>But it was his first volume of memoirs that placed him squarely in public favour. The second volume, indeed, is almost better than the first \u2013 lewd, very funny, not very likeable but possessed of a festival turn of abuse.</p> <p>He has, too, in this volume the advantage of a couple of very good subjects. The art world comes in for it in detail, and their willingness to overlook a shocking forgery for the sake of a quick buck makes for a number of excellent stories. His atrocious mother's decline and death make one important strand in this book \u2013 \"'Oh you,' she said, screwing up her face in enmity, 'you know everything.'\"</p> <p>The centrepiece, however, is the fall and disgrace of Sewell's mentor, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5889879/Anthony-Blunt-confessions-of-spy-who-passed-secrets-to-Russia-during-the-war.html\" title=\"\">Anthony Blunt</a>. Sewell is one of a generation who believed it was genuinely worse to betray a friend than to betray one's country. On Blunt's exposure, Sewell helped to conceal him from the media, and was known to do so. He came in for a measure of the abuse heaped on his master and friend. I'm not sure what anyone else would have done for an old friend, and others helped Blunt in different ways. Though what Blunt did was dreadful, his treatment was brutal \u2013 not just Blunt, but Sewell too was stripped of his library privileges at <a href=\"http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/index.html\" title=\"\">the Courtauld</a>. No doubt both of them experienced offensive and frightening behaviour from strangers in the street who believed that Blunt had sent men to their deaths by his treason.</p> <p>The joy of the memoir, however, is not in the innate value of his views on anything in particular, but in the peculiar personality revealed, and in the energy of the writing. One undeserving object after another is dragged through the mud. \"Sometimes he came from his farm in Buckinghamshire in a wooden-bodied <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_A70\" title=\"\">Austin Hereford </a>shooting brake, a favourite pig sitting upright in the passenger seat beside him \u2013 the pair of them resembling a demonstration diagram from some 18th-century tome on physiognomy and expression.\"</p> <p>That is a description, let it be said, of one of Sewell's friends. And the enemies?</p> <p>Poor old <a href=\"http://www.theartsdesk.com/users/sarahkent\" title=\"\">Sarah Kent</a>, the former visual arts editor of Time Out, is left his eyes in one of a long sequence of wills. Somebody ought to publish those. I bet they're hilarious exercises in score-settling. <a href=\"http://www.normanlebrecht.com/\" title=\"\">Norman Lebrecht</a>, the music writer, gets the full treatment: \"Never was a favourite so puffed up with amour-propre, so arrogant and so thick-skinned.\" Blunt's awful boyfriend is glimpsed \"sinking into boredom and inactivity; he could spend hours slicing carrots very thin and whining on the telephone in the vile slang of the malevolent queen.\" (Loving those carrots). Sewell is magnificently snobbish in a period way, still speaking of \"those who hasten from the Clapham Omnibus into the National Gallery\" without any acknowledgement that Clapham, for some time, has not been the natural home of the horny-handed son of toil.</p> <p>Interestingly, human beings don't have to do anything very much to make themselves totally unacceptable \u2013 not knowing enough about Leonardo, spontaneously providing Sewell with a hot blond boy for company, or being too keen on Damien Hirst will do. On the other hand, any old dog can shit on the carpet all they like, and be rewarded by a forgiving twinkle in her master's eye \u2013 \"I am content to tolerate the consequence of her relaxing sphincter.\"</p> <p>It's not the only incongruity buried in Sewell's personality. He evidently thinks pretty highly of himself \u2013 \"I have just read some of that catalogue [of a Council of Europe rococo exhibition in 1958 he wrote] and am astonished by how good it is \u2013 my present sense that the essentials of all writing on art should be clarity and thoroughness was obviously well-established before it became my sole occupation.\" Thoroughness is a very good thing indeed, but perhaps we would trust Sewell's devotion, and his thorough disdain for that honourable breed, newspaper subs, if he had somewhere learnt that it is Wilfrid, not Wilfred Blunt, Compostela, not Compostella, and so on. I do think that a worldly art critic should know that the gallery in Munich is the Pinakothek, not the Pinakotek, too.</p> <p>Like many people who think themselves amusing, he's slow to recognise a joke when made by anyone else \u2013 when Blunt said it was \"strange to find a Scottish restaurant in Dusseldorf\" when driving past a McDonald's, even he could not have been so innocent.</p> <p>Never mind. The joy of the memoir is largely in its filth, beyond the reach of any goggle-eyed fact-checker. \"Geoffrey was a dab hand at making buggers of men who had never thought of it.\" Here Sewell's insight is unfaultable, though sometimes faintly incredible.</p> <p>There is a glorious, though barely believable story of a memorable evening round the Royal Military Police barracks which ends with Sewell being delivered by the copper and his room-mate into the mess room. \"Anyone want him before I let him go? He's a bloody good fuck.\" (To get the most out of these excellent tales, you have to think of them in Sewell's dowager tones). There is a useful tip about how to avoid being picked out by the river police with their searchlights, should you be shagging in the cruising ground near Hammersmith Bridge. Your partner in joy might well, Sewell tells us, be an oarsman, who were \"always sheepishly passive, uncooperative in any foreplay, just wanting to be fucked \u2013 something to do with the repetitive action of rowing, I suppose.\" When a gentleman caller did make it home, his awful mother did her best to rain on Sewell's one-man parade. \"You're not the only one,\" she told a surprised Danish colleague. \"He's got a little Scottish boy, you ought to know.\"</p> <p>Awful as he no doubt is, his memoirs are tremendously enjoyable. He has never written with more haughty, scabrous bathos as here, and never writes better than in telling some much-honed anecdote of bad sexual behaviour.</p> <p>Possibly his sexual partners, these days, are not quite so abundant or as disinterestedly enthusiastic as they once were: still, they make a good story. \"I considered the indignity of the spectator not worth the candle.</p> <p>\"He tried a better offer. 'Pay for my drugs and you can fuck me while I fuck her.'\" And even if you can't bear the notion of Brian Sewell, his opinions and his duchessy persona, then there is something irresistible about his memoirs. It's how well they are written. Face it: whose memoirs would you rather read? His, or Sarah Kent's?</p> <p>\u2022 Philip Hensher's <em>The Missing Ink: The Lost Art of Handwriting, and Why it Still Matters </em>is published by Macmillan.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/3/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">The Public Services (Social Value) Act, </a>which comes into effect in January 2013, places a legal duty on public service commissioners to take account of social value when procuring services.</p> <p>In these financially constrained times we're all looking for ways to make the money in our purse go as far as possible. As new commissioning organisations take hold of the NHS purse strings they will want to do the same for local people and communities, getting maximum benefit out of every penny they spend.</p> <p>Commissioners have a responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers' money they spend helps, not hinders, local communities, and raises the profile of health among the populations they serve. This is social value \u2013 the benefits which public services can achieve beyond simple financial value, including wellbeing, health, employment and inclusion.</p> <p>With clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), made up of local GPs and grounded in local communities, deciding how to spend the vast majority of the NHS's \u00a380bn commissioning budget, there is enormous potential for achieving significant extra value and improving the health and wellbeing of local people as they do.</p> <p>Legal experts have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2012/sep/11/live-discussion-social-value-act\" title=\"\">written</a> about the pitfalls the new legislation could create, and it's true that it might take a little time to feel comfortable in the new landscape. But the potential reward of using the NHS's significant commissioning power to enhance the health and wellbeing of our communities is simply too great not to embrace wholeheartedly.</p> <p>The NHS in north west England is already part of a forward-thinking network of organisations committed to promoting social value, through the <a href=\"http://www.nwsocialvaluefoundation.org/\" title=\"\">North West Social Value Foundation</a> set up in 2010. This group's work focuses on three main ways NHS organisations could add social value: through delivering social value as a by-product of mainstream business, for example buying goods and services locally; creating an organisational culture that highlights the importance and benefits for the community of adding social value; and realising social value which already exists in community resources, for example local professional sports teams helping to get across healthy living messages.</p> <p>For CCGs taking the reins in 2013, there is a real opportunity to start as they mean to go on. And health and wellbeing boards will be well placed to support both local authorities and NHS commissioners to make social value part of the fabric of improving health and wellbeing within their localities across all sectors \u2013 local authority, NHS, voluntary and private employers.</p> <p>At times, the NHS can act as though it's forgotten that it's funded by and part of the community it serves. New opportunities will also be provided by strengthening community engagement and involvement through local Healthwatch organisations, the bodies being established to provide a strong voice for local people and one which must be taken into account when planning local services.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/publicservicessocialvalue.html\" title=\"\">Social Value Act coming into effect in the new year</a> and new commissioners putting the finishing touches to their set-up over the coming months, it could be the perfect combination of factors for social value to get the time, space and priority it deserves.

  "<p><strong>What does your role leading large scale change in healthcare involve?</strong></p> <p>I act as a thought leader, identifying, developing and testing new ideas and practices about change for the NHS and helping to adapt them. Many of the previous, incremental ways of undertaking change aren't fast enough or broad enough for the future. I've been leading practical strategies to test and implement large-scale change at a national level in the NHS for more than a decade. My role is also about making connections and building knowledge networks across the NHS and the globe.</p> <p><strong>What's your professional background?</strong></p> <p>I joined the NHS in 1991 as part of a scheme to bring senior leaders from other industries into the health sector, but my first degree was in social science. In my 20s, I worked in organisational and leadership roles in local government and education. My roles were always about leading change, helping people think differently and building new skills. I set up one of the earliest total quality management projects in education in the late 1980s.</p> <p><strong>You are very active on Twitter \u2013 how important is social media?</strong></p> <p>Social media provides a phenomenal gateway to networks and connections and enables us to build communities with people with the same interests and challenges from across the globe. In a one-hour scheduled Twitter discussion, we can make 250,000 \"impressions\". I can pick up the latest trends and opinions instantly, and we are making increasingly good use of other virtual communication systems, such as online webinars. Social media has no regard for hierarchy. It is such a powerful enabler for the healthcare improvement movement and we need to ride the wave.</p> <p><strong>What would transform the public sector's reputation for a lack of innovation?</strong></p> <p>The gap between the potential and reality of innovation is a significant issue. That's why the national NHS strategy Innovation, Health and Wealth is so important. The NHS has the most unbelievably creative workforce, which has produced some of the biggest global breakthroughs in clinical science and service delivery methods. It's about how to unleash that across the whole system.</p> <p><strong>What have you learnt about managing large-scale NHS change?</strong></p> <p>The biggest lessons have been about the combination of things necessary to transform care in highly complex environments. It's really important to make connections with peoples' intrinsic motivations and values and ignite latent energy for change. At the same time, to build systemic change, we have to utilise the powerful extrinsic drivers of change; financial incentive and payment schemes, performance management and measurement.</p> <p><strong>What has been your biggest career achievement?</strong></p> <p>Helping to make improvement mainstream in the NHS. When I first started in healthcare improvement, it was a lonely occupation, undertaken by only a few enthusiasts and visionaries. Now, 20 years later, the systematic application of quality improvement methods happens in most NHS organisations to some degree.</p> <p><strong>Has anyone inspired you along the way?</strong></p> <p>My greatest NHS inspiration is my mother, who worked as an NHS domestic assistant for nearly 30 years. My mum lived out her NHS values in her role, through her hard work, her kindness and positive attitude. She epitomises thousands of NHS workers in the extent to which she was willing to help others and do far more than she was employed to do. I aspire to be like her every day.</p> <p><strong>How important was it to be recognised as one of the 60 most influential people in the NHS and more recently as one of its top 10 opinion formers?</strong></p> <p>I'm humbled, especially by the recognition at the time of the 60th anniversary of the NHS. It can be very tough being a leader of change and an organisational heretic, working from the inside, walking the fine line between difference and fit, rocking the boat yet trying to stay in it. So, if people whose opinions I respect say they appreciate what I do, it helps me to keep doing it.</p> <p><strong>Many NHS reforms have been highly controversial \u2013 do you think they were for the greater good?</strong></p> <p>I have worked under a number of different political administrations, all of which implemented healthcare reforms. In every case, there were aspects of reform that I would have chosen to adopt and others I wouldn't. However, the role of people like me who want to secure the future of the NHS system and see it improve, is to find opportunity in the reform process and use it as a lever to enable positive change.</p> <p><strong>What's your leadership style?</strong></p> <p>I'm strongly driven with a sense of higher purpose, and I hope that I help to build shared purpose with others. My style is energetic, enthusiastic, hopeful and focusing on strengths rather than deficits. I hope I help others to see possibilities and opportunities that they might not see themselves.</p> <p>Marshall Ganz, who leads the community organising programme at Harvard University and is one of my teachers, describes the role of leaders as \"enabling others to achieve purpose in the face of uncertainty\". I think that is so pertinent for the leadership task in the current circumstances of the NHS.</p> <p><strong>What do you do to relax? </strong></p> <p>In the last couple of years, I've made a big effort to learn to ballroom dance properly. As a child, my school physical education report described me as \"angular\" and \"awkward\", and I kept those labels in my head all my life. I never dreamed I would be able to dance well, and now I can.</p> <p><em>You can find out more about Helen Bevan's work in the NHS and large scale change by reading the </em><a href=\"http://www.changemodel.nhs.uk\" title=\"\"><em>NHS Change Model</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\"><em>public leaders network</em></a><em>, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>One of the most attractive aspects of the older politician, as Lord Heseltine perhaps needs to be described at the age of 79, is that they do not care too much what other people say about them. Another joy is that they have an institutional memory. Long forgotten and little read official reports into local government reorganisation published back in 1969 remain at their finger tips. Little is new under their sun, making it a good deal harder for a civil servant to pass off bromide as initiative.</p> <p>Both in interview, and in his blockbuster report into the absence of a coherent government growth strategy, Lord Heseltine glows with both strengths. Few features of public life, government bureaucracy, private sector managers, chambers of commerce, civil servants, Tory ideologues, local councillors, timewasting planning officers or self-serving financiers are spared the lash in his report spanning 226 pages and more than 80 recommendations.</p> <p>His conversation is also replete with references to previous doomed attempts to reorganise local government, create industrial strategies or galvanise Whitehall.</p> <p>In an eloquent personal opening passage he admits that the very words \"industrial strategy\" are controversial. \"With them comes the baggage of past attempts and past failures,\" he says.</p> <p>He also recalls how it is 57 years since he left Oxford University for London, how his first view as a businessman was that all he wanted was to get government off his back and then how his experience in government so tempered that view.</p> <p>The complexities of local government reform, the planning system. Britain's role in space, the saving of Rolls-Royce, Concorde, defence procurement, the international competitiveness agenda all made him confront the way in which other national governments, unlike Britain, aided and abetted their wealth creators.</p> <p>His views on the role of government were never so simple again.</p> <p>But that leads to the question of why David Cameron ever asked an interventionist such as Heseltine to conduct such a wide-ranging review of government growth strategy. After all, Cameron's previous favourite peer from the Thatcher era had been Lord Young of Graffham, a man who broadly believed government was a problem, not a solution.</p> <p>In interview, surrounded by two ferociously bright civil servants, Heseltine says few should be surprised by the scope or contents of his report. He explains it was Steve Hilton (Cameron's former director of strategy and a fellow Whitehall iconoclast) who \"fixed for me to see the prime minister with a view to do something broadly like this, and I outlined the view I broadly hold. The prime minister said this was something he wanted done, and would I report to the Chancellor George Osborne and to Vince Cable?\"</p> <p>It was not an invitation from the blue. Cameron had asked Heseltine to speak to the Tory conference in 2006 on city mayors, an idea that has for the moment stalled. Despite his advancing years Heseltine had been chosen by Cameron to chair the advisory committee on the regional growth fund.</p> <p>Cameron was also happy to give him an official from each department, including the Treasury.</p> <p>Little has escaped his unflinching gaze: skills policy, airport expansion, the appointment of permanent secretaries, immigration, or foreign company takeovers and finance for industry. \"I think it has been a unique experience and I think from the very beginning everyone knew of the scale of what I was doing.\"</p> <p>He knows his report will, to use one of Cameron's favourite phrases, put \"rocket boosters up Whitehall and industry\".</p> <p>\"If you want a sit rep for the status quo, well stay where you are. Will Britain become more competitive? Answer no. It is not rocket science. We ought to recognise that every other capitalist economy on Earth has adopted a local bottom-up strategy \u2013 maybe we should try it too, if only for the simplest possible reason is that it is what made this country in the first place. London did not drive the national economy in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was driven by the great buccaneer cities of the industrial revolution.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he is confident his blueprint will be implemented, Heseltine says: \"I travel with more than hope. The government is committed to localism. I am not countering government policy. I am saying 'Good, let us have another leap.'\"</p> <p>His central proposal, and perhaps biggest leap, is a plan to reorder government to make it focus on industrial growth. At the apex of this structure would be a national growth council responsible for a growth strategy, leading to further sub-growth strategies department by department, setting out how each Whitehall department will hold dialogues with its relevant industrial sectors.</p> <p>He then proposes taking \u00a349bn currently administered by central government departments, and putting this cash, plus \u00a39bn in EU funding into a single funding pot.</p> <p>The cash covers skills, local infrastructure employment support, new housing, business support services and innovation. Local enterprise partnerships, the bodies bringing together local businesses and councillors to drive growth, would be expected to bid for this cash in what he sees as a big extension of localism, or regionalism.</p> <p>He says precedents for this include the work of Howard Bernstein in Manchester with Goldman Sachs, Heseltine's own work in Liverpool and plans by Lord Adonis to galvanise the north-east economy.</p> <p>He insists the 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) set up by this government can be made to work, and that high-quality entrepreneurs do want to be involved in them, so shaping their city economy. He explains: \"At the moment they don't think there is an opportunity do a man-size job on these bodies and in the present circumstances, and I would agree with them.\"</p> <p>He recognises some secretaries of state may be reluctant to hand this cash into the single pot, saying: \"That is what 100 years of impoverishing the provinces have done. It is perfectly conceivable if the prime minister wants it. That is what localism is about.\"</p> <p>He accepts that 39 LEPs as may need to change their boundaries to better fit the local economic shape, and suggests Whitehall and LEPs have three months to discuss if their confines need adjusting.</p> <p>He insists that LEPs are currently shaped broadly to match city regions, the future engines of growth, pointing out that they do broadly match the boundaries set out by John Redcliffe-Maud in the late 1960s, and then rejected by the Heath government of 1970-74. He insists he is not imposing unitary councils on local government; just suggesting they are the preferred option. There are a dozen unitary councils already and they save \u00a315m a year, he points out.</p> <p>He insists he is not proposing a throwback to the era of the national economic developments councils attempted in the 60s and 70s, saying: \"Those were tripartite talking shops. They had no money. I was part of it. It was ridiculous. People turned up with their prepared statements and the conversation was designed to get nowhere.\"</p> <p>He adds that he is not interested in accusations of corporatism or picking winners, two of the phrases that have been successfully deployed by free marketeers to keep the state and industry apart. He said: \"There is an army of people in Whitehall picking winners every day. When they gave me \u00a32.4bn to spend on a regional growth fund what I am supposed to do? Pick losers?\"</p> <p>Nor will he bow at the altar of deregulation. \"Civilisation depends on regulation. The market will not regulate itself. The market knows no morality. If you allow the law of the jungle, you will get the consequences of the jungle, so governments of all persuasions create the basis of civilisation, which is stopping people doing terrible things at the extreme. You just have to get the balance right.</p> <p>\"The simple solution to growth \u2013 'get off our backs, cut taxes, deregulate' \u2013 but you would not find that solves the problem because no other government finds that it does solve the problem. Those three sentiments may have a contribution to make, but they are so simplistic.</p> <p>\"Confidence is the thing holding back the economy at the moment and who can blame anyone from feeling so. There are no signs yet that there is a way through it \u2013 maybe now just a bit \u2013 and that is we do not have the confidence to invest.\"</p> <p>Whether all this emerges to be Heseltine's last will and testament, patronised as a throwback to a failed corporatist era and so doomed to be of interest to historians, or instead the start of a new era of industrial activism, it will be for Cameron, or a future government to decide. Either way, the jungle is a richer place for having such big beasts on the roam once again.</p>",
  "<p>A vibrant democracy needs a noisy, edgy, vibrant civil society.\" These were <a href=\"http://www.acevo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Acevo</a> chief executive Stephen Bubb's words to the public administration committee last week, during an evidence session of its inquiry into charity regulation. Bubb was moved to defend the right of charities to campaign after Charlie Elphicke MP suggested that political activity was damaging public confidence in the sector.</p> <p>Elphicke had two recent cases in mind. In September there was <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Save the Children's</a> report into child poverty in Britain. Its headline finding \u2013 that one in eight of the UK's poorest children go without at least one hot meal a day \u2013 was quickly picked up by Labour, who blamed the shocking statistic on the government's \"chaotic decisions\". When the right-leaning media twigged that Save the Children's chief executive was a former Labour adviser, Conservative MPs lined up to <a href=\"http://www.cesi.org.uk/social-inclusion-news/2012/sep/save-children-uk-appeal-attacked-its-political-agenda\" title=\"\">denounce its \"political agenda</a>\" .</p> <p>Soon after, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/9605196/Women-Tory-MPs-plot-revolution-at-150-year-old-Fawcett-Society.html\" title=\"\">the Telegraph reported</a> that a group of Conservative MPs \u2013 including home secretary Theresa May \u2013 had joined the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fawcett Society</a> enmasse in an attempt to stop the gender equality charity acting as a \"mouth piece for Labour\". They claimed that the society's campaigning \u2013 including a legal challenge to the 2010 emergency budget \u2013 was at odds with its charitable objectives.</p> <p>There may be a strong element of mischief-making in both these cases, but Elphicke could be right about public distaste for overtly political campaigning. An<a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/publications/1473/Public-trust-and-confidence-in-charities.aspx\" title=\"\"> Ipsos MORI poll </a>in June found that 7% of those whose trust in the sector had decreased blamed \"political bias/pressure\". Not a huge figure perhaps, but it is more than three times what it was in 2010 \u2013 before high profile campaigns against welfare reform and spending cuts.</p> <p>At first glance, the rules on political activity are clear. Charities have every right to campaign for a change in law or policy if it would help achieve their charitable purposes. The important caveats are that this cannot become a charity's sole purpose and that explicitly party political activity is forbidden. The case of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/oct/05/charity-liam-fox-axed-watchdog\" title=\"\">Atlantic Bridge </a>seems an obvious case of a charity crossing these lines.</p> <p>But the length of the <a href=\"http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Publications/cc9.aspx\" title=\"\">commission's guidance</a> on the issue \u2013 almost 14,000 words \u2013 suggests there are some expansive grey areas. What's striking is the emphasis it places on public perception; it is not enough for a charity to act impartially, it should also \"stress and make clear its independence\".</p> <p>What does that mean in practice? The commission advises charities to ensure the language they use is politically neutral, to ensure speaking invitations are extended to all parties and to use MPs' photographs judiciously. A commission spokesperson even suggests including an impartiality disclaimer on campaign materials.</p> <p>But demonstrating political independence isn't just about keeping the regulators happy \u2013 it usually makes for more effective campaigning too. \"We would always advise charities not to put all their eggs in one basket, politically speaking,\" says <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk\" title=\"\">NCVO's</a> parliamentary and media manager Chloe Stables, \"and to work across the political spectrum building consensus because it's a much better way of getting public policy change through.\"</p> <p>It's a view shared by Estelle McCartney, a director of public affairs agency <a href=\"http://champollion.co.uk\" title=\"\">Champollion</a>, who says charities that focus their campaigning on too narrow a part of the political spectrum risk harming their reputation. \"In the short term they can damage relationships with whichever political grouping that they have antagonised,\" she says. \"In the longer term it damages their overall credibility if they're seen to be acting from a position of partisanship rather than a position of informed, evidenced policy contribution.\"</p> <p>McCartney, who is also a trustee of <a href=\"http://www.independentage.org\" title=\"\">IndependentAge</a>, says there are two important principles that should help charities avoid accusations of bias. The first is ensuring that any claims made as part of the campaign are meticulously researched and backed by evidence. The second is pursuing cross-party engagement long before the campaign has been launched \u2013 attacking government policy will never be popular with government MPs, but opening up a dialogue in advance can at least ensure they are not caught off guard by a campaign run solely through the media.</p> <p>It is not only politicians that campaigners need to persuade, however \u2013 often their biggest challenge is winning over the public. Linda Butcher, chief executive of campaigning support charity the <a href=\"http://www.smk.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sheila McKechnie Foundation</a>, says this is made all the more onerous when campaigns don't look beyond their natural supporter base. \"Very often you look at who they're focusing on and it's people who are already behind the cause,\" she says. \"But actually, when you have limited resources and you look at the impact you need to make, you should be spending more time on people who don't agree with you.\"</p> <p>The sector will almost certainly face more accusations of political bias over the coming months, some of which will be disingenuous attacks on the right of charities to campaign at all. But by asking if their tone and messages could be alienating potential supporters \u2013 and if too many resources are focused on those who already agree \u2013 campaigning charities could become more effective as a result.</p> <p><em>James Gray is a freelance writer and charity consultant.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

So it was not a surprise to hear that Lucas will remain as a creative consultant on the new Star Wars films.</p> <p>\"For the past 35 years, one of my greatest pleasures has been to see Star Wars passed from one generation to the next,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It's now time for me to pass Star Wars on to a new generation of filmmakers. I've always believed that Star Wars could live beyond me, and I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime.\"</p> <p>Disney's chief executive, Robert Iger, said: \"Lucasfilm reflects the extraordinary passion, vision, and storytelling of its founder, George Lucas.</p> <p>\"This transaction combines a world-class portfolio of content including Star Wars, one of the greatest family entertainment franchises of all time, with Disney's unique and unparalleled creativity across multiple platforms, businesses, and markets to generate sustained growth and drive significant long-term value.\"</p> <p>Disney said it will pay about half the purchase price in cash and issue about 40m shares. The purchase, which comes in the wake of Disney's acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel, includes Lucasfilm's prized high-tech production companies, Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound, as well as rights to the Indiana Jones franchise.</p> <p>Kathleen Kennedy, the Lucasfilm co-chair who was handpicked earlier this year by Lucas, will become president of Lucasfilm and serve as executive producer on the new feature films, with Lucas adopting a consultancy role.</p> <p>It is 35 years since the first Star Wars film. The sixth and most recent instalment in the series was 2005's prequel, Revenge of the Sith, which was given a mixed reception by critics but broke several box office records and was that year's second highest grossing film.</p> <p>However, many passionate Star Wars fans have been hitting out at Lucas for years, alleging that he had become a commercial sell-out. They railed against him for adding grating characters such as Jar Jar Binks in the second Star Wars trilogy and attacked him for tinkering with the original trilogy, too.</p> <p>The criticism grated on Lucas, who vowed never to make another Star Wars movie during <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/magazine/george-lucas-red-tails.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">an interview with the New York Times earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>\"Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?\" Lucas told the Times.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/31/george-lucas-retiring\" title=\"\">Reports later suggested</a> that the filmmaker had become disillusioned with Hollywood after experiencing difficulties in securing the distribution last year of his second world war film about squadron of African-American pilots, Red Tails, which he funded by Lucas with $58m of his own money after studios refused to back it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyqlTi7lkhY&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;noredirect=1\" title=\"\">In a video posted on YouTube</a>, Lucas said the decision to continue with the Star Wars saga was not inconsistent with past statements.</p> <p>\"I always said I wasn't going to do any more and that's true, because I'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean I'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy [Kennedy] to do more,\" Lucas said.</p> <p>Amid a delighted reaction from many fans, suspicion and fears for the future were also present in large doses.</p> <p>\"I feel sick. It's like having your Mum have an affair and remarry,\" <a href=\"http://boards.theforce.net/threads/disney-buys-lucasfilm-star-wars-7-planned-to-release-2015.50004772/\" title=\"\">said one participant</a> on <a href=\"http://theforce.net/\" title=\"\">TheForce.net</a> fan site.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://iamevilcupcakeblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/star-wars-7/\" title=\"\">one blogger suggested the most recent Star Wars films had completed the series and pleaded</a>: \"Please don't make us regret this George. You still owe us big time for introducing us to Jar Jar Binks.\"</p> <p>Peter Hartlaub, pop culture critic at the San Francisco Chronicle and a Star Wars fan <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/thebigevent/2012/10/30/disney-buys-lucasfilm-three-questions-from-a-star-wars-fan/\" title=\"\">expressed doubt in another blog</a> that the new Star Wars film could be turned around in time for 2015: \"My hope as a fan is that this isn't another Iron Man 2 situation, where the studio's eagerness to pump out a sequel on a tight deadline seriously harms the potential of the finished product.\"</p> <p>Jay Rasulo, Disney's senior executive vice-president, has hinted at the future direction of what the company described as the \"Star Wars saga\": \"Today, Star Wars is heavily skewed toward toys and North America. We see great opportunity domestically to extend the breadth and depth of the Star Wars franchise into other categories.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/31/star-wars-disney-lucasfilm?intcmp=ILCMUSTXT9383\">\u2022&#xa0;Blog: The force may be strong with Disney</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/31/star-wars-7-disney-pictures?intcmp=239\">\u2022&#xa0;Star Wars 7: a Disney production - in fan pictures</a></p>",
  "<p>Lord Heseltine will on Wednesday deliver an explosive critique of the government's economic policy when he publishes a six-month study commissioned by Downing Street that dismisses deregulation as the sole path to growth and lambasts Whitehall for the lack of a coherent state led industrial strategy.</p> <p>In a no-holds-barred report, the experienced former Conservative cabinet minister warns \"continuing as we are is not an acceptable option\", adding \"the message I keep hearing is that the UK does not have a strategy for growth and wealth creation\".</p> <p>His iconoclastic proposals call for a major restructuring of local government and handing \u00a358bn of Whitehall cash to city-based engines of growth, co-ordinated by businesses and local councils.</p> <p>Among some ministers there was incredulity that David Cameron had asked such an interventionist figure as Heseltine to compile a report into every aspect of Britain's low growth.</p> <p>The Tory peer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had huge admiration for the government over its decision to commission a report from him, and said the chancellor, George Osborne, had backed the initiative.</p> <p>\"You have to be very strong and very confident to ask admittedly a very long-standing friend and supporter to look at what you're doing and suggest how you could do it better,\" Heseltine said.</p> <p>Heseltine said the government was doing an \"extremely good\" job but that there were things that could be done \"further and faster\" than presently as he pressed the need for \"urgency\" in stimulating growth.</p> <p>He said he had \"told it as I see it\" and was braced for resistance from some parts of Whitehall that feared losing some of its power base.</p> <p>Heseltine said the fact that the published report appeared well-received by the union and business lobby alike underlined the \"one nation\" narrative he attributed to Cameron.</p> <p>\"I have had nothing but encouragement from the prime minister, from the chancellor and I've got baggage, they know my views, so there was bound to be in the report things that they've said, 'Oh my God, he's off again.' OK fine, but if I had done less than that, if I had tried to avoid the difficult issues, tried to sort of paper over anything that might be called a criticism, you people would say, 'What a waste of time, why did he bother to do all of that?'\"</p> <p>He added: \"So I've told it as I see it but I've told it in a way that is very supportive of the opportunity this government has got. And if I may make what I think is quite an important point: the prime minister talks of 'one nation', no one believes that more passionately than I do. We've produced a report that is supported by the CBI and the TUC. If that isn't a platform one which you can talk bout one nation, I don't know what is.\"</p> <p>The report, originally commissioned at the initiative of Cameron's then-strategy adviser Steve Hilton, challenges government policy on a vast range of specific issues such as a third runway in the south east, immigration, a wider public interest test to block foreign company takeovers, skills, and the structure of both central and local government.</p> <p>In remarks directed at Osborne that will be greeted with delight by the Liberal Democrats, he says the private sector will not invest in energy infrastructure \"without real certainty about the UK's long-term energy policy\".</p> <p>He will also infuriate the Tory right by rejecting crude deregulation or tax cuts as the fast track to prosperity, saying \"the principal void in today's investment climate is confidence \u2013 and tax changes will have only a limited effect on that\".</p> <p>He says: \"I reject the notion that regulation in itself hinders growth. Good, well-designed regulation can stop the abuse of market power and improve the way markets work to the benefit of business employees and consumers.\"</p> <p>Calling for a long-term industrial strategy, Heseltine says he does not \"believe the current structures do enough to enable the government to work together coherently to drive through the change required\".</p> <p>He added: \"Whitehall continues to approach these issues from the individual policy priorities of different departments as if economic issues can be effectively addressed in a placeless vacuum.\"</p> <p>Heseltine has consulted government ministers closely during the preparation of the report, but in an attempt to underline his independence he has largely kept the conclusions from ministers, briefing the business department only on Monday.</p> <p>Osborne is bound to find some of the remarks in the report difficult to digest, although its criticisms of Whitehall and the planning process will be welcomed.</p> <p>The communities secretary Eric Pickles strongly opposes a local government reorganisation.</p> <p>Heseltine is careful to endorse the government's deficit reduction strategy, but the wider criticisms in the report condemning the absence of a clear credible growth strategy have been seized on by Labour just weeks before an Autumn Statement that is likely to contain another downgrading of UK growth forecasts.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"It's a damning indictment of this government that, halfway through this parliament, a former Conservative cabinet minister is still calling for a plan for growth.</p> <p>\"Since the spending review two years ago we've had growth of just 0.6% compared to the 4.6% growth George Osborne said he would deliver. And the result of the government's failure is that families are worse off, long-term unemployment is rising and borrowing is going up.\"</p> <p>In possibly his central proposal, Heseltine suggests nearly \u00a348bn of current government cash earmarked for growth over four years in different Whitehall departments should be placed in a single funding pot for local areas. He proposes adding nearly \u00a39bn of EU funding to the pot, saying current spending of this EU cash is bureaucratic and inefficient.</p> <p>He suggests the 39 local enterprise partnerships (LEPs), the government's chosen engine of local economic growth, then bid for this pool of cash which would be diverted permanently from budgets of departments.</p> <p>But he criticises the current quality of LEPs that replaced the regional development agencies, calling for them to be strengthened saying \"they currently do not have the authority or resource to transform their locality\".</p> <p>On local government, he complains England has 353 principal authorities, some unitary and some operating as two tiers with district and county councils, a structure, he describes as \" baffling and bears no relation to modern economic activity\". Legislation preventing councils becoming unitary authorities passed by the government should be repealed, he says.</p> <p>Heseltine also suggests city mayors, largely rejected by referendums in May, should be appointed without the need for a local plebiscite. He complains that the government approach to empowering local economic communities has been complex and piecemeal. The government, he says, has \"been prepared to dip its toe, or several toes, in the water but not yet prepared to accept the full logic of its position with the confidence it should\".</p> <p>Turning to Whitehall he calls for a new national growth council chaired by the prime minister, a body that sounds similar to the national economic council set up by Gordon Brown, but abolished by the government. The council would publish a national growth plan, linked to departmental reports, and approve LEP bids for funding.</p> <p>He concedes the business department has published industrial plans but dismisses them, saying, \"put crudely, who has heard of them or changed their behaviour as a consequence?\"</p> <p>He adds: \"There is a powerful appetite in the business world for the government to lay down a vision for how we will achieve long term prosperity in the UK and a plan to ensure its implementation through all departments\".</p> <p>He complains that in the regions, \"disparate teams of civil servants from different departments are not working in a cohesive way\".</p> <p>He also lambasts departmental business plans as \"not being fit for purpose\", and says Whitehall has no management information system in place to allow ministers to know \"what their civil servants do, how much it costs, who authorised it what output measures have been set or, crucually, whether they are being met\".</p> <p>Setting out a timetable for the government to implement his plans, Heseltine says: \"Some will say there are criticisms. That is exactly the wrong approach. To invite criticism is a sign of strength, to accept it is a sign of confidence.\"</p>"
